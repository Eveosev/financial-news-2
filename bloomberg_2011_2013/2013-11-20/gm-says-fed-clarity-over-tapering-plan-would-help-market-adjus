General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest U.S.
automaker, said efforts by the  Federal Reserve  to reduce its $85
billion in monthly bond purchases would benefit from clarity
about the plan.  “I think about it a lot like gas prices, where we can
gradually adjust to gas prices in an economy where that happens
over a more gradual time frame,”  Mark Reuss , president of GM’s
North America operations, told reporters today at the Los
Angeles Auto Show. “Clarity always helps, it adds, people can
plan.”  Federal Reserve officials said they may reduce their
monthly bond purchases “in coming months” as the economy
improves, according to minutes of their last meeting released
today in Washington.  Policy makers “generally expected that the data would
prove consistent with the Committee’s outlook for ongoing
improvement in labor market conditions and would thus warrant
trimming the pace of purchases in coming months,” according to
the record of the Federal Open Market Committee’s Oct. 29-30
gathering.  Officials also discussed how to clarify or strengthen their
communication about the economic thresholds that guide how long
 interest rates  will stay low.  “There’s expansion that can happen as long as there’s not
a spike” in interest rates, Reuss said of the U.S auto market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
