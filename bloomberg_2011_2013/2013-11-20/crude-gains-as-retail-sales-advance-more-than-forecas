West Texas Intermediate was little
changed as the Federal Reserve said it might reduce stimulus
“in coming months,” countering a report that showed fuel
consumption climbed to a five-year high.  Prices dropped 1 cent. The Fed may pare the $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases as the economy improves, minutes of the
Federal Open Market Committee’s last meeting that were released
today showed. Petroleum  demand  averaged over four weeks reached
20.3 million barrels a day last week, the most since August
2008, the Energy Information Administration said.  “The Fed’s comments suggest that we may see less money
floating around in the financial world, and that could depress
the prices of a number of assets including oil,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in
Winchester,  Massachusetts . “The EIA report shows that we are
seeing some strength in demand.”  WTI for December delivery, which expired today, settled at
$93.33 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The more
active January contract slid 4 cents to $93.85. The volume of
all futures traded was 22 percent below the 100-day average.  Brent for January settlement advanced $1.14, or 1.1
percent, to $108.06 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume was 16 percent below the 100-day
average. The January contract was at a premium of $14.21 to WTI
for the same month. The spread was $13.03 yesterday, the
narrowest in a week based on closing prices.  Fed Minutes  Policy makers “generally expected that the data would
prove consistent with the committee’s outlook for ongoing
improvement in labor market conditions and would thus warrant
trimming the pace of purchases in coming months,” according to
the record of the Fed’s Oct. 29-30 gathering.  The release of the minutes came after the EIA reported the
increase in petroleum demand. Four-week average total demand
increased 2.8 percent last week, a fourth consecutive gain.
Consumption of distillate fuels, including  diesel  and heating
oil, jumped 6.4 percent, and gasoline usage went up 0.4 percent.
The government measures shipments from refineries, pipelines and
terminals to calculate demand.  “Refinery product demand is the primary fundamental driver
of higher prices,” said Tom Finlon, Jupiter, Florida-based
director of Energy Analytics Group LLC. “We should have every
expectation of continued strong refinery product demand. Demand
is driven by exports.”  Distillate Exports  Distillate exports were at a four-week average of 1.36
million barrels a day. They reached 1.39 million in the period
ended Oct. 11, the most since EIA  data  started in June 2010.  On a weekly basis, total fuel demand reached 20.4 million
barrels a day in the seven days ended Nov. 15, the highest level
since December 2010. It was the fourth straight increase.  Crude  stockpiles  grew 375,000 barrels, below the 1 million-barrel increase forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Supplies went up for a ninth week to 388.5 million barrels.
Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , WTI’s delivery point, climbed
to 39.9 million, the most since July 26.  “While the crude inventory build came in lower than
expected, any price rise will be short term,” said Adam Wise,
who helps manage a $6 billion oil and gas bond portfolio as a
managing director at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston .
“There are still very robust supplies, at least domestically.”  Product Inventories  Inventories of distillate fuels, including heating oil and
diesel, fell 4.8 million barrels to 112.5 million, the least
since Nov. 23, 2012. The analyst forecast was for a decline of
280,000. Gasoline stockpiles dropped 345,000 to 208.9 million,
near the estimated decrease of 300,000.  Crude has declined 7.4 percent in the past month on rising
inventories and easing of global political tension.  Iran  and the
five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council
plus  Germany  are negotiating to break a decade-long deadlock and
help remove sanctions against Iran which have cut oil exports.  “There are still larger concerns about the geopolitical
situation,” said David McAlvany, chief executive officer of
McAlvany Financial Group in Durango,  Colorado . “The market has
been preoccupied for a long time with when quantitative easing
will go.”  Iran was the sixth-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries last month with 2.6 million
barrels a day, according to a Bloomberg survey. That’s down
565,000 barrels from June 2012, when it was ranked second.  “If we can get an Iran deal done, we will break below the
$90 level,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund
manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
January was 17.3 percent, down from 17.7 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 407,959
contracts as of 3:04 p.m. It totaled 591,367 contracts
yesterday, 2.5 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.62 million contracts, the least since Feb. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
