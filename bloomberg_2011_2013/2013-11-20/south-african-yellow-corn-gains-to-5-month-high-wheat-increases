South African yellow-corn futures
rose to the highest level in five months by the midday close in
Johannesburg. Wheat also gained.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 1 percent to 2,391 rand ($235) a metric ton,
the highest for this specific contract since June 20, by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange. The white variety
for December delivery advanced 1 percent to 2,455 rand a ton.  South Africa  is the continentâ€™s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety of the grain is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat futures increased 0.6 percent to 3,540.20 rand a ton,
the most since Nov. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
