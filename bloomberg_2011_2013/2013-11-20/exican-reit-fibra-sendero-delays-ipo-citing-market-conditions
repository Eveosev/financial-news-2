Administradora Sendero SA (FISEN13) , a Mexican
real-estate investment trust that owns shopping centers, said
itâ€™s delaying a planned initial public offering because of poor
market conditions.  The trust, known as Fibra Sendero, disclosed the delay in a
filing today with the Mexican stock exchange. Fibra Sendero had
planned to sell the shares today, with the goal of raising about
5.3 billion pesos ($405 million) including an over-allotment
option for underwriters.  While Mexican companies have raised a record $12.2 billion
in IPOs and other equity offerings this year, stock prices have
slumped, with the benchmark IPC index of 35 companies falling
6.7 percent. The BMV Fibras index of six Mexican REITs has
declined 3.3 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
