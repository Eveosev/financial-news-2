Thailand ’s baht fell by the most in
more than a week amid concern political unrest will further slow
the economy. Ten-year sovereign bonds dropped for a third day.  The currency touched a two-month low as the  Constitutional
Court  ruled against the government’s attempt to establish a
fully elected Senate that would have resulted in the disbanding
of the ruling party, according to a live broadcast on the TPBS
TV channel. Supporters and opponents of the government are
holding separate demonstrations in Bangkok today. The economy
grew 2.7 percent last quarter, slowing from 2.9 percent in the
previous three months that was the weakest since the first
quarter of 2012, official data showed Nov. 18.  “The political situation in Thailand remains uncertain and
the economic outlook is weak,” said Tohru Nishihama, an
economist covering  emerging markets  at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “The baht will probably continue to
see some downward pressure for a while.”  The baht fell 0.3 percent, the biggest loss since Nov. 11,
to 31.68 per dollar as of 2:36 p.m. in Bangkok, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 31.74 earlier, the
weakest level since Sept. 18.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, declined two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.94 percent.  Thailand’s government cut its 2013 expansion forecast on
Nov. 18 to 3 percent from a range of 3.8 percent to 4.3 percent
projected in August. It also said it expected no export growth
this year, compared with 5 percent in 2012.  The yield on the 3.625 percent sovereign bonds due June
2023 increased four basis points to a two-month high of 4.13
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
