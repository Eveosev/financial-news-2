WorleyParsons Ltd. (WOR) ,  Australia ’s
biggest oil and gas engineer, fell by a record in Sydney trading
after saying profit will be less than a forecast given last
month.  The stock dropped 26 percent, the most since its 2002
listing, to A$16.00 at the close in Sydney on volume about eight
times the three-month average. Profit in the year ended June
2014 will be A$260 million to A$300 million, the company said in
a regulatory statement today. WorleyParsons said at its
shareholder’s meeting last month that profit would be more than
the previous fiscal year’s A$322 million.  Australia’s engineering services companies are facing a
tougher environment as slowing mining industry demand growth
cuts revenue.  Seven Group Holdings Ltd. (SVW)  said Nov. 12 it would
cut about one in six jobs in its WesTrac Caterpillar Inc.
dealership with earnings forecast to fall as much as 40 percent
from a year earlier.  Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) , the country’s
biggest builder, said Nov. 13 the value of booked contracts had
fallen 6.3 percent in the year to September and debt levels were
above its target.  WorleyParsons’s decline today wiped A$1.38 billion off its
market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
