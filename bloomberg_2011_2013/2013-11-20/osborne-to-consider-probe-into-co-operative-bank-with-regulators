U.K. Chancellor George Osborne may
order a probe into the Co-Operative Bank Plc after the chairman
of its owner quit following a drug scandal.  Osborne will discuss “what is the appropriate form of
inquiry to get to the bottom of what went on here,” with
regulators, Prime Minister David Cameron told lawmakers in
Parliament today.  Co-Operative Group Ltd. Chairman Len Wardle, 69, resigned
yesterday after leading the board that appointed Paul Flowers as
chairman of its lending unit. Co-Op Group is reviewing its
governance structure after the Mail on Sunday reported on Nov.
17 Flowers had bought illegal drugs in Leeds, northern  England .  Under the 2012 Financial Services Act, the chancellor has
the power to order an independent inquiry if he wants it to look
at areas wider than those that would be covered by a single
regulator.  Regulators pressed Co-Op Group, which has businesses
ranging from supermarkets to funeral parlors, to close a capital
shortfall at the bank following the failure of its bid for more
than 600 branches owned by  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  earlier this
year. Co-Op Group last month ceded control of the bank as part
of a plan to fill the capital hole.  -- Editor: Jon Menon  To contact the reporter on this story:
