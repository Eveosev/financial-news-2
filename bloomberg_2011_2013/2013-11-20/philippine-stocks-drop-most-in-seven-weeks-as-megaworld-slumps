Philippine stocks  fell the most in
seven weeks, leading declines in Asia, as financial companies
and power producers slid.  Megaworld Corp. plunged 6.4 percent, pacing losses by
property developers.  Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. (MBT)  retreated
more 2 percent.  Energy Development Corp. (EDC) , the nation’s largest
geothermal power producer, slumped to its lowest level since
August 2010.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  sank 2.3 percent to
6,126.09 at 2:40 p.m. in  Manila , heading for the biggest loss
since Sept. 30. The country is grappling with the effects of
Typhoon Haiyan, which slammed into the central part of the
country on Nov. 8. The gauge has retreated 17 percent since May
22, when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said for the
first time the central bank could taper its $85 billion-a-month
asset-purchase program.  “Today’s movement is a continuation of portfolio
realignment by overseas investors that started since the Federal
Reserve started to signal possible stimulus tapering,” said
 James Lago , head of research at PCCI Securities Brokers Corp.
“The typhoon has provided overseas investors a good excuse to
continue taking profit.”  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index is valued at 17.8 times
this year’s estimated earnings, the second-most expensive among
13 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. Overseas investors have
sold a net $113.5 million of Philippine shares this month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Megaworld slumped to its lowest level since Oct. 7.
Metropolitan Bank declined to an 11-month low.  Storm Damage  Haiyan, one of the deadliest typhoons in Philippine
history, may cut economic growth through the third quarter of
next year and reconstruction costs may reach as much as 4
percent of the economy, Finance Undersecretary Gil Beltran said
yesterday.  Policy makers raised inflation forecasts for this year and
next, estimating consumer-price gains to average 3.2 percent in
2013 and 4.5 percent in 2014, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. That compares with an October forecast of
3 percent for 2013 and 4 percent for 2014.  The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council
in its latest bulletin put the death toll at 4,011, with 18,557
people injured and 1,602 missing.  Energy Development  fell 5 percent. The stock sank 12
percent yesterday after saying none of its typhoon-damaged power
plants are operable.  First Gen Corp. (FGEN) , which controls the
company, dropped 1.4 percent in a 10th day of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
