A storm may sweep up the East Coast
as temperatures drop next week, bringing cold and rain to
travelers on the road for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, said
Matt Rogers, president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Computer models show a storm developing by midweek, Rogers
said. Rain will fall in the big cities of the Northeast, while
some interior areas may have snow.  “This could change if the early week cold gets trapped
in,” Rogers said in e-mail interview from Bethesda,  Maryland .
It is “worth watching.”  Heavy rain, winds and snow can disrupt air travel across
the U.S. especially if storms strike airports in New York and
New Jersey. The U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, on Nov. 28 for 2013,
is one of the busiest travel times of the year.  Temperatures from Texas to New York and New England may be
at least 8 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 Celsius) below normal from
Nov. 25 to 29, Rogers said in his forecast. Readings may be
about 5 degrees below average in  Chicago  and the upper Midwest.  Below-normal temperatures, especially in Eastern and
Midwestern cities, tend to increase energy consumption as more
people heat homes and businesses. November marks the start of
the U.S. heating season, when natural gas demand peaks.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas use,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. About 49 percent of all homes use
the fuel for heating.  The normal average temperature in New York on Nov. 27 is
about 45 degrees, according to MDA. In  Boston , it’s 42; in St.
Louis, 41;  Dallas , 52; Houston, 59; Chicago, 35; Burbank,
 California , 57; and in Calgary, it’s 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
