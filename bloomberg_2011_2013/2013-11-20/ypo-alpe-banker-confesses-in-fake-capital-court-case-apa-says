Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International
AG managers were aware that they misrepresented a tranche of
preference shares as regulatory capital in 2006 and 2007, a
defendant told a court today, the Austria Press Agency reported.  Josef Kircher, a former manager at the bank Austria had to
nationalize in 2009, changed his plea and confessed to charges
of misuse of funds and false accounting in a court in southern
Austrian Klagenfurt, APA reported. The other accused former Hypo
Alpe managers were also aware that the 100 million euros ($135
million) of preference shares were misrepresented and took
actions to keep that secret, he said.  Kircher, Wolfgang Kulterer, Hypo Alpe’s former chief
executive officer, and two others were charged with false
accounting and misuse of funds by Austrian prosecutors because
they gave investors an option to sell the securities back to
Hypo Alpe. That option disqualified them from being counted as
regulatory capital, and also meant that Hypo Alpe paid dividends
that were too high, prosecutors said.  Richard Soyer, Kircher’s lawyer, didn’t immediately return
a call to his firm. Kulterer’s lawyer, Dieter Boehmdorfer, said
in a telephone interview that his view is that the shares were
legitimate regulatory capital and Kircher’s statement didn’t
change anything.  To contact the reporter on this story:
