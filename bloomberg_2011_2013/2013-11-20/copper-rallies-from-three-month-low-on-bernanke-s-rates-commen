Copper in London advanced for the
first time in three days after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the benchmark interest rate will remain low long
after policy makers reduce bond purchases.  The contract for delivery in three months on the London
Metal Exchange rose as much as 0.7 percent to 7,020 a metric ton
and traded at $7,003 by 10:52 a.m. in Tokyo. The metal, which
touched $6,910 yesterday, the lowest level since Aug. 7, is
still down 12 percent this year.  Bernanke said a “preponderance of data” would be needed
to start removing stimulus, after his nominated successor, Fed
Vice-Chairman  Janet Yellen , signaled last week that the U.S.
economy is not yet strong enough to warrant cuts to the record
bond-buying program. The  Federal Open Market Committee  publishes
minutes of its October meeting today.  “Bernanke’s comment helped boost copper,” said Chae Un Soo, a metals trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in
 Seoul . Investors will watch for comments from an industry
conference in Shanghai today and China’s manufacturing data
tomorrow, he said.  The dollar weakened against the euro for a fourth day to
the lowest level since Nov. 1. Stockpiles monitored by the LME
extended a slump to the lowest since February.  Copper for delivery in February on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 1 percent to 50,320 yuan ($8,260) a ton. Futures
for delivery in March gained 0.5 percent to $3.183 a pound on
the Comex in New York.  On the LME, nickel, lead and tin climbed, while aluminum
and zinc were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
