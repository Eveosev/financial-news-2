California’s independent Legislative
Analyst’s Office said Governor  Jerry Brown  will have a general
fund operating surplus in 2014-2015 of $3.2 billion.  The state’s 2013–14 reserve, forecast at $1.1 billion, will
more than double to $2.4 billion, mostly on higher capital gains
taxes from stock price growth, the LAO said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
