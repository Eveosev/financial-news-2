Desert locusts are grouping in
Mauritania,  Sudan  and Yemen, with the risk of a “potentially
dangerous” situation in coming months, the  United Nations ’ Food
& Agriculture Organization said.  Juvenile locusts, known as hoppers, as well as adults are
forming groups after breeding, the Rome-based FAO wrote on its
 Locust Watch  website yesterday.  Ground teams have sprayed more than 13,000 hectares (32,124
acres) in Mauritania and 2,200 hectares in Sudan this month, as
well as about 8,000 hectares in Yemen in the first 10 days of
November, according to the FAO.  “Intensive survey and control operations should be
maintained,” the FAO wrote.  In Yemen, a second generation of locusts started laying
eggs about 10 days ago, and hatching and grouping are expected
to start from the end of November, the FAO said.  A swarm of locusts covering a square kilometer (0.4 square
mile) can eat between 80 and 160 metric tons of crops a day,
based on calculations using FAO data.  An adult desert locust can eat its own weight of about 2
grams (0.07 ounce) daily, and swarms can cover several hundred
square kilometers, with 40 million to 80 million of the insects
per square kilometer, according to the FAO.  Desert-locust distribution can extend over 60 countries
during plague years,  covering  about 29 million square
kilometers, according to the UN agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
