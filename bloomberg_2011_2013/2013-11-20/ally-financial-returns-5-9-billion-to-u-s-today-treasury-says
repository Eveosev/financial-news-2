Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the auto lender
bailed out by U.S. taxpayers, repaid the government $5.9 billion
today, the Treasury Department said.  Taxpayers have been repaid $12.3 billion, or more than 70
percent of the investment provided under the Troubled Asset
Relief Program, according to a Treasury statement today. The
 Federal Reserve  said Nov. 15 that it doesnâ€™t object to a revised
capital plan submitted by Detroit-based Ally.  Ally said in August that it planned to pay the Treasury the
$5.9 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
