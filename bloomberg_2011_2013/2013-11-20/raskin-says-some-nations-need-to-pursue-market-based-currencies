Some U.S. trading partners need to
pursue policies that rely more on markets to set the value of
their currencies, said  Sarah Bloom Raskin , the Obama
administration’s nominee to be the No. 2 official at the
Treasury Department.  “I will go out on a limb here and speak specifically of
 China ,” the world’s second-largest economy, Raskin said during
a Senate Finance Committee hearing to consider her nomination to
be deputy  Treasury secretary .  “It’s incredibly important that we get the relationship
with China right and my understanding is that there are a number
of multilateral and bilateral forums that Treasury has been
working through in order to bring about certain changes in those
relationships, one having to do with moving towards a more
market-based set of exchange rates,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
