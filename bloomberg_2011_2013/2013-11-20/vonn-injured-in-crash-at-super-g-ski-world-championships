Olympic downhill champion  Lindsey Vonn  crashed while preparing to return to racing, nine months
after undergoing surgery to repair knee ligaments and a leg
fracture.  Vonn was doing downhill training yesterday at the U.S. Ski
Team’s Speed Center at Copper Mountain, Colorado, when she fell,
U.S. Ski Team spokesman Tom Kelly said in an e-mail last night.  The 29-year-old American, who won gold at the 2010
Vancouver Olympics, wasn’t admitted to a hospital and is in Vail
to be evaluated by William Sterett, the doctor who performed her
knee surgery, Lewis Kay, a spokesman for Vonn, said in an e-mailed statement last night.  “We expect to have clarity on the situation in the next 24
hours,” Kay said.  Vonn, who was hospitalized with intestinal pain last
November, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Nov. 12 that
she was “100 percent” and planned to return to the World Cup
tour for a Nov. 29 race in Beaver Creek,  Colorado . The Olympics
begin Feb. 7 in Sochi,  Russia .  Four-time overall World Cup champion Vonn, who has won six
straight downhill season titles, tore the anterior cruciate and
medial collateral ligaments in her right knee and fractured a
bone just below the knee joint in a February crash during a
super giant slalom race at the world championships in
Schladming,  Austria .  Vonn, who has been dating world No. 1 golfer Tiger Woods,
needs four World Cup race wins to pass the record tally of 62
held by Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
