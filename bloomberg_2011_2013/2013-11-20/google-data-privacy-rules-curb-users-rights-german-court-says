Google Inc. (GOOG) , which has faced
scrutiny from privacy regulators across Europe, was told by a
German court that 25 provisions in its data protection rules
limit the rights of its users.  A Berlin court yesterday struck down the provisions in the
company’s general data-use terms, ruling that they violated
German law, a consumer group said in a  statement .  “The decision is an important signal for IT companies,”
Gerd Billen, head of the group, Verbraucherzentrale
Bundesverband, said in the statement. “They have to change
their approach to data protection and take seriously German data
protection and consumer rules.”  Google, owner of the world’s most-used search engine,
reached a $17 million settlement with 37 U.S. states this month
over its circumvention of privacy settings for some users.
Google and  Facebook Inc. (FB)  are among U.S. Internet companies that
have come under pressure in the 28-nation European Union over
their use of personal data.  Google said in a statement that it will appeal the ruling.
“We believe our terms of service and privacy policy comply with
all applicable laws,” the Mountain View, California-based
company said.   Under proposed EU rules, U.S. companies could face fines of
as much as 100 million euros ($135 million) for data protection
violations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
