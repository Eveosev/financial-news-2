Mongolia  completed its first paved
road connecting Ulaanbaatar to the border with China, which buys
more than 80 percent of the nation’s exports.  Prime Minister Norovyn Altankhuyag attended a ribbon
cutting ceremony to open the final 116.25 kilometers (72 miles)
of highway stretching from the city of Sainshand to the border
town of Zamyn-Uud, the state-run Montsame News Agency reported
yesterday. The total distance of the highway is about 630
kilometers, according to Mongolia’s Ministry of Roads.  In the first 10 months of this year, China bought 86
percent of Mongolia’s exports, mainly shipments of coal and
copper, according to the the  National Statistics Office  of
Mongolia. About 29 percent of Mongolia’s imports come from China
in the period, according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
