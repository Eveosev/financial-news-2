The ruble weakened, heading for the
lowest close in more than two months against the central bank’s
target basket of currencies, as the withdrawal of a retail
bank’s license added to the impact of easing  yuan  controls.  The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent to 38.0230 against Bank
Rossii’s target basket of dollars and euros by 4:10 p.m. in
Moscow, the lowest level on a closing basis since Sept. 6. The
yield on the government’s February 2027 bonds rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.83 percent.  The central bank revoked the license of Moscow-based OAO
Master-Bank for repeatedly breaching  money laundering  laws. The
yuan’s three-month forwards touched a record high after the
People’s Bank of China strengthened the daily fixing to a record
and elaborated on plans to ease exchange-rate controls.  “Some foreign investors are afraid of a possible banking
crisis” in Russia, Vladimir Miklashevsky, a strategist at
 Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Helsinki, said by e-mail. “It all started
yesterday with  China , but the situation with Master-Bank spurred
it.”  A banking crisis in 2004 started with the regulator
revoking a license for suspected money laundering. Master-Bank
is the 17th lender to lose its license since Elvira Nabiullina
became Bank Rossii chairman in June, raising the total number to
23 this year, according to central bank data. During 2012, 23
licenses were pulled. Master-Bank’s press service wasn’t
available when Bloomberg called the number on its website.  Currency Switch  The ruble weakened 0.2 percent against the euro to 44.3855
and dropped 0.2 percent against the dollar to 32.7990. An index
of the 20 most actively-traded emerging-market currencies
declined 0.1 to 93.1817, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China’s central bank will “basically” end normal
intervention in the  currency market  and widen the yuan’s trading
band, Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  wrote in a book explaining reforms
outlined at a Communist Party meeting last week. The PBOC raised
the  reference rate  0.02 percent to 6.1305 per dollar, the
strongest since a peg to the greenback was removed in 2005.  “If they let the yuan go, it’ll start strengthening, so it
may be a good time to switch from other marginal currencies into
the yuan,” Miklashevsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
