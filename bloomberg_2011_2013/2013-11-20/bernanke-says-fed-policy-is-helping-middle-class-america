Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank’s policies are helping the
American middle class by supporting housing, strengthening
financial markets and shoring up consumers’ balance sheets.  “Our objectives are squarely tied to Main Street,” he
told a gathering of economists in  Washington  today. “The
economy has been growing, jobs have been coming back and the Fed
has been an important factor in maintaining that momentum.”  Asked if Fed stimulus was providing a coup for Wall Street
and trivial relief for Main Street, Bernanke said he disagrees.  “It’s simply not true to begin with,” he said. “We’re
using the tools we have to meet our dual mandate.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
