Deere & Co. (DE) , the second-largest
maker of construction equipment in the U.S., forecast better-than-expected earnings for its 2014 fiscal year as a house-building recovery boosts demand for its loaders and excavators.  Net income will drop to about $3.3 billion in the year
through Oct. 31, Moline, Illinois-based Deere said in a
statement today. That’s more than the $3.06 billion average of
17 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. It said total
equipment sales will fall about 3 percent, compared with an
average estimate of a 9.5 percent decline. The shares rose 2.1
percent in New York.  Deere sees sales of construction and forestry equipment
advancing by about 10 percent in the current financial year,
partly because of the recovery in the U.S. economy and an
increase in housing starts. That will limit the impact of a 6
percent decline in revenue from agricultural and turf machinery.  “There will be a relatively positive reaction in the
morning based on the guidance,” Larry De Maria, a New York-based analyst for William Blair & Co. who recommends selling the
shares, said in a phone interview today. “However, the
deteriorating fundamentals for agriculture will eventually weigh
on the shares.”  The shares closed at $84.52, their biggest gain in three
months.  Crop Receipts  Deere also reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings today. Profit was $2.11 a share in the three
months through Oct. 31, up from $1.75 a share a year earlier.
That’s more than the $1.90 a share average of 20 estimates.
Equipment sales fell to $8.62 billion from $9.05 billion,
matching the average estimate.  The company is the world’s largest maker of agricultural
equipment, which accounted for 76 percent if its sales in fiscal
2012, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg, while 18 percent
came from construction and forestry.  Deere is facing its first drop in annual earnings in five
years as U.S. farmers reap a record harvest of corn and other
crops. Corn futures in  Chicago  are down 50 percent since trading
at a record in August 2012. U.S. farm cash receipts, a key
indicator for equipment sales, will decline to $377.7 billion in
2014 from $391.8 billion this year, Deere said in a slide
presentation on its  website  today.  In contrast, the U.S. housing industry is beginning to
recover, with purchases of new homes rising in August. Sales
increased 7.9 percent to a 421,000 annualized pace following a
rate of 390,000 in the prior month, according to government
figures. U.S. construction spending in August was the highest
since April 2009, other government   data  show.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  is the world’s largest maker of
construction equipment. Its global retail machine sales dropped
12 percent in the three months through October compared with a
year earlier, the Peoria, Illinois-based company said today in a
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
