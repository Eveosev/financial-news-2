Oscar Pistorius , the South African
Paralympian gold medalist who killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, was served a new indictment with two additional gun
charges, according to the National Prosecuting Authority.  “There were two additional charges that were included in
the indictment today,” the prosecutor’s spokesman Nathi Mncube
said by telephone. “These two new charges relate to
contraventions of some sections in the Firearms Control Act.”  The athlete was made aware of the charges earlier today,
Mncube said. He declined to give further details on the nature
of the charges.  The track star was indicted for murder and possession of
ammunition after shooting his girlfriend Steenkamp dead on Feb.
14, Valentine’s Day. The runner says he thought Steenkamp was an
intruder at his Pretoria home.  A judge in the North Gauteng High Court will hear the case
from March 3 to March 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
