Wheat swung between gains and losses
on speculation declining prices may spur demand as global
production climbs to a record.  The contract for March delivery rose and fell at least 0.3
percent before trading at $6.58 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade at 11:32 a.m. in  Singapore . Futures have lost 7.5 percent
since reaching a four-month high of $7.1125 on Oct. 21 and are
set to retreat for a second month in November.  Wheat tumbled this year on expectations global production
will reach an all-time high 706.38 million metric tons,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Egypt , the
world’s biggest importer, said yesterday it bought 120,000 tons
from  Russia , while Lebanon will tender today to buy 20,000 tons.
Japan is seeking to buy the most milling wheat in three months
from the U.S.,  Canada  and Australia.  “It was falling too far too fast,” Ole Houe, director
advisory services at Ikon Commodities Pty Ltd. in Sydney, said,
referring to prices. “When you look at export numbers around
the world, U.S. wheat is very competitive. It’s a general
expectation that the U.S. will be getting a lot of export
demand.”  About 18.1 million bushels of wheat were inspected for
export in the week ended Nov. 14, 45 percent more than the week
prior, according to the USDA. The U.S. is the world’s biggest
exporter of wheat, according to the agency.  Corn for March delivery was little changed at $4.2675 a
bushel. Soybeans for delivery in January traded little changed
at $12.7775 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
