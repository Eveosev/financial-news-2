Turkey ’s benchmark bond yields rose
to the their highest in nine weeks after the central bank said
it would raise overnight interest rates between banks to 7.75
percent.  The yield on two-year  notes  climbed 23 basis points, or
0.23 percentage point, to 9.01 percent at 3 p.m. in Istanbul,
the highest level since Sept. 13 on a closing basis. The lira
was little changed at 2.0108 against dollar.  The central bank decided to stop monthly repurchase
auctions to reduce the volatility of short-term money market
rates, according to a statement on its website yesterday. It
said in a statement today this would converge  interbank money
market  rates to around 7.75 percent, which takes cumulative
tightening to “around 350 basis points” since May. The bank
said it would maintain “cautious monetary policy until the
inflation outlook is in line with medium-term targets.”  “It appears that the central bank determines inflation as
the main goal,” Ugur Kucuk, a fixed-income strategist at Is
Securities Investment, said in e-mailed comments. The central
bank’s statement to raise overnight rates to 7.75 percent “is
negative for short- and medium-term  interest rates .”  The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee maintained the
overnight lending and borrowing rates, the upper and lower ends
of the interest-rate corridor, at 7.75 percent and 3.5 percent
at it meeting yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
