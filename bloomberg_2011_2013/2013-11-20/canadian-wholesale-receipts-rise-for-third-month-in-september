Canadian wholesale  sales  rose for a
third month in September, led by a surge of receipts in
Saskatchewan.  Sales rose 0.2 percent to C$49.8 billion ($47.7 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, compared with the median
 estimate  for a 0.3 percent gain in a Bloomberg survey with 12
responses. The agency also revised down the gain in August to
0.4 percent from an initial estimate of 0.5 percent.  Wholesalers have seen receipts stall since the first half
of 2012, coinciding with a slowdown in the Canadian economy that
reflects slumping exports and business investment. Sales in
September were 0.2 percent below May 2012 levels. From a year
ago, sales were 2.6 percent higher.  Canadaâ€™s economy is projected to expand 1.7 percent this
year, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development forecast this week. That would be unchanged from
2012, matching the slowest pace for growth since the 2009
recession, when output contracted 2.7 percent.  Four of seven major categories tracked by Statistics Canada
rose in September, representing about 45 percent of sales.  Sales in the province of Saskatchewan rose 4.6 percent
during the month led by increased sales of farm products, which
gained 4.8 percent nationally, and agricultural supplies, which
rose 4.3 percent.  In volume terms, wholesale sales rose 0.2 percent,
Statistics Canada said.  Inventories decreased 0.2 percent to C$61.8 billion,
leaving the ratio of inventories to sales unchanged at 1.24.  To contact the reporter of this story:
