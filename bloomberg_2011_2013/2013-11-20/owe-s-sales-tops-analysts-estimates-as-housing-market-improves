Lowe’s Cos. (LOW) , the second-largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, posted third-quarter profit that
trailed analysts’ estimates as it works to match Home Depot
Inc.’s growth in an improving housing market. Lowe’s stock fell.  Earnings for the three-month period ended Nov. 1 were 47
cents a share, Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe’s said
today in a statement. Analysts had estimated 48 cents on
average. Net income in the quarter advanced 26 percent to $499
million.  Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock has trimmed slow-selling products from Lowe’s inventory and negotiated lower
prices with vendors to catch up to larger Home Depot, which
yesterday posted profit and sales that topped analysts’
projections. Lowe’s said sales at stores open at least a year
climbed 6.2 percent in the quarter trailing the 7.4 percent gain
 Home Depot (HD)  reported.  “Home Depot is better-positioned to benefit from the
ongoing improvements in housing,” Alan Rifkin, an analyst at
Barclays Plc in New York, wrote in a note before the results
were released. Lowe’s “slightly disadvantaged real estate
portfolio coupled with its less robust merchandising
capabilities has the potential to drive future
underperformance.”  Rifkin rates Lowe’s equal weight, the equivalent of a hold.  Lowe’s third-quarter revenue rose 7.3 percent to $13
billion. The average of 20  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was
for $12.7 billion. Annual profit will be $2.15 a share, up from
a forecast in August of $2.10, the company said. Analysts had
predicted $2.19 on average. Sales will rise about 6 percent, up
from a prior  prediction  of 5 percent.  Home Depot  Lowe’s stock  fell  6.2 percent to $47.33 at the close in New
York. Home Depot slipped 0.8 percent to $79.75. Lowe’s has
gained 33 percent this year, while Home Depot has added 29
percent.  Home Depot said yesterday that net income in the three
months ended Nov. 3 rose 43 percent to $1.35 billion, or 95
cents a share, as revenue increased 7.4 percent to $19.5
billion. Analysts estimated profit of 90 cents a share on sales
of $19.2 billion.  Profit per share in the fiscal year through January will be
$3.72, Home Depot said. That was up from a previous forecast of
$3.60 and higher than analysts’ average estimate of $3.70.  Lowe’s and Home Depot have benefited from the one-and-a-half year climb in the U.S. housing market that has given
homeowners confidence to renovate kitchens and bathrooms. Prices
for single-family homes climbed in 88 percent of U.S. cities in
the third quarter as buyers competed for limited inventories
that included fewer discounted foreclosures, according to a
report from the National Association of Realtors.  The nationwide median price for an existing single-family
home rose 12.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier
to $207,300, the group said.  Lowe’s operated 1,831 home improvement and hardware stores
in the U.S.,  Canada  and  Mexico  as of Nov. 1, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
