New York City Opera , which filed for
 bankruptcy protection  last month after years of management
missteps, won court approval to auction some assets, including
costumes, wigs, props and about 60 musical instruments.  The public sale was approved yesterday by U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Sean Lane in Manhattan. The auctioneer, Tiger Remarketing
Servicing LLC, will get 10 percent of the proceeds from the
sale, which also includes the opera’s gift shop inventory of CDs
and books and a harp at  Lincoln Center  in New York.  The auction procedure “is in the best interests of the
debtor, its estate and creditors,” Lane said in his order.  Stock scenery, tools, stage curtains and prop fabric at the
opera’s facility in New Windsor,  New York , will be auctioned, as
will computers and office furniture from the opera’s office on
Broad Street in Manhattan, according to a Nov. 6 request to
approve the sale.  The opera company, created 70 years ago as the “people’s
opera” because of its affordable tickets, filed a Chapter 11
petition on Oct. 3 after it failed to meet an emergency online
fundraising goal of $7 million. The opera listed assets of $6.67
million and debt of $3.59 million in a court filing.  “This is all part of the process of winding down,”  Peter
Schottenfels, an opera company spokesman with Risa Heller
Communications, said in an e-mail.  The case is New York  City Opera  Inc., 13-bk-13240, U.S
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
