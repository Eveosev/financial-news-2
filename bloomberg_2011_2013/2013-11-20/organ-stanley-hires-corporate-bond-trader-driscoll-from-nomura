Morgan Stanley (MS)  hired Daniel Driscoll
from Nomura Holdings Inc. to trade investment-grade notes for
the fourth-most active manager of the debt in the U.S.  Driscoll, who ran financial-debt trading at Credit Suisse
Group AG in the U.S. before leaving last year, will join Morgan
Stanley’s New York office as a managing director, according to
Mark Lake, a spokesman for the firm. Driscoll didn’t respond to
a message left on his mobile phone seeking comment.  Driscoll worked for  Japan ’s largest brokerage for about a
year after a decade-long career at Credit Suisse, where he
focused on both investment-grade and high-yield bank bonds.  Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, has
managed 9.4 percent of investment-grade bond sales in the U.S.
this year, up from 8.2 percent last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg that excludes deals in which banks manage
their own offerings. Companies have sold $1.07 trillion of the
debentures in 2013, 3.9 percent more than what had been issued
by this time in 2012, when a record $1.12 trillion of the debt
was sold, Bloomberg data show.  Morgan Stanley ranks behind JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of
America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. in bond deals managed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
