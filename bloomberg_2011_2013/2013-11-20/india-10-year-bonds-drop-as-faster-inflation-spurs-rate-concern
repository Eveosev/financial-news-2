India ’s 10-year government bonds
fell, pushing the yield toward a three-month high, on concern
faster inflation will force the central bank to increase
borrowing costs further.  Wholesale prices  rose 7 percent in October from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since February, while  consumer-price
inflation  accelerated to 10.1 percent, separate reports showed
last week. The  Reserve Bank  of India will study data, including
food prices and exchange-rate depreciation, before deciding
whether to increase the benchmark rate for a third straight
meeting, Governor  Raghuram Rajan  said Nov. 13. He raised the key
 repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent on Oct. 29,
the second consecutive increase.  “Markets are pricing in another 25-basis-point increase in
the repo rate at next month’s policy” meeting, said Sagar Shah,
associate vice president for treasury at Ratnakar Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai. “The high yields are a reflection of the inflation and
tightening concerns.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.02 percent as of
9:57 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from the central bank’s
trading system. The rate reached 9.05 percent on Nov. 12, the
highest since Aug. 19, after the wholesale-price inflation data
was released.  The rise in government bond yields is “temporary,”
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters in
Mumbai yesterday. He said he hopes inflation will ease soon and
that the central bank will take steps to soften yields.  The RBI bought 61.57 billion rupees ($986 million) of debt
maturing between 2015 and 2025 at an open-market auction on Nov.
18 after Rajan announced a plan to buy as much as 80 billion
rupees of notes  last week . The RBI said it will auction new 10-year securities on Nov. 22.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points to 8.58 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
