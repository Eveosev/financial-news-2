Codelco, the world’s biggest copper
producer, plans to increase the fee it charges Chinese buyers by
41 percent in 2014 as demand strengthens, said two people with
direct knowledge of proposals made by the Chilean miner.  The premium to be added to the price of the metal for
immediate delivery on the  London  Metal Exchange will climb to
$138 a metric ton from $98 this year, according to copper
industry executives in China who asked not to be identified as
the negotiations are private. That compares with the $135 median
of 14 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey last month and is the
highest since 2005, based on data from researcher CRU.  Codelco, which earns more than 90 percent of its revenue
from the metal, has already increased the premium for  Europe  by
32 percent. Higher fees would shore up earnings at the Chilean
miner as it faces a 12 percent drop in futures prices in London
this year. Copper imports by  China , the biggest user, surged to
a 19-month high in September as economic growth picked up and
demand may rise 6.5 percent in 2014, Barclays Plc estimates.  Helmut Arbert, a representative for Codelco in China,
declined to comment.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose 0.2 percent to $6,986 a ton at 6:26 p.m. Shanghai
time.  The  premium  on the  spot market  for shipments to Shanghai on
a cost, insurance and freight basis is around $190 a ton,
compared with $195 late last month and a record $210 in early
August, data provided by SMM Information & Technology Co. show.  While China is world’s largest copper-producing nation, it
doesn’t produce enough to meet its own needs.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
