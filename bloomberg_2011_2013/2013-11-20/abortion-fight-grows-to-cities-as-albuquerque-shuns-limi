Albuquerque  became the first U.S. city to reject a ballot measure to ban abortions after 20 weeks, delivering a blow to opponents of the procedure who had hoped to expand their fight beyond courts and state legislatures.  Residents of New Mexico’s largest city voted 55 percent to 45 percent yesterday  against  setting the first municipal-level abortion restrictions on doctors in a bid to shut down a clinic.  “Let this be a lesson to Congress and all 50 states: Yesterday the people of Albuquerque rejected an extreme agenda pushed by out-of-touch, out-of-state groups that want to end safe and legal abortion altogether,” Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a news release.  Creating a battleground in cities would give abortion-rights opponents another venue for efforts to close clinics performing the procedure legalized nationally in the  Supreme Court ’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The court in 1992 upheld the constitutional right to an abortion before the fetus is capable of living outside the womb, which is generally considered to begin at about 24 weeks.  Skirting Lawmakers  The strategy to offer a municipal ballot measure in Albuquerque, a city of about 555,000, was embraced because the New Mexico legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, hasn’t acted on bills to restrict abortions, said Cheryl Sullenger, senior policy adviser at Operation Rescue, a Wichita, Kansas-based anti-abortion group.  “Year after year, pro-life legislation gets introduced and it dies in committee,” she said. “Pro-life supporters may have suffered a political loss, but we are far from defeated. We’ll be back.”  The Albuquerque clinic, called Southwestern Women’s Options, performs abortions through 28 weeks, according to its  website . Other clinics performing abortions in the third trimester are located in Boulder,  Colorado , and Germantown,  Maryland .  “There are very few providers who perform abortions at this point in gestation,” said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based reproductive-health research organization. “This is a very targeted attack on them.”  The Vanishing U.S. Abortion Clinic Only 1.5 percent of abortions are performed at 20 weeks or later, Nash said. At least 10 states have passed laws since 2010 banning abortions after the 20th week.  Protested Polls  The Albuquerque measure drew protesters to polling places and “brought a heightened emotional element to the election process for some people,” Amy Bailey, Albuquerque’s city clerk, said in an interview.  Almost 44,000 residents came to the polls to weigh in on the measure during early voting from Oct. 30 through Nov. 15, compared with the roughly 26,000 who voted early in the mayoral election last month, Bailey said.  The citizen initiative is a “very rarely used part of the city charter,” Bailey said. It was used last year for the first time in seven years to approve a minimum wage increase, she said.  Empty Act  Even if it had been approved, the Albuquerque measure “would not be legally enforceable,” Gary King,  New Mexico ’s attorney general wrote in an Oct. 9 letter to Trudy Jones, an Albuquerque City Council member.  He pointed to cases in which federal courts struck down statutes passed by  Idaho ,  Arizona ,  Arkansas  and  North Dakota  that were similar or identical to the Albuquerque proposal. The basis for the decisions was rooted in Roe v. Wade, he said.  The cases “show that the overwhelming weight of judicial authority doesn’t support enactments, like the proposed Albuquerque ordinance, that attempt to ban otherwise legal abortions,” King wrote.  In states like  California , which has a law protecting women’s access to abortion pre-viability, a locality couldn’t pass a more restrictive standard because it would conflict with the state law, said Maya Manian, a law professor at the University of  San Francisco .  New Mexico doesn’t have such a law, according to Nash.  “You would still have a problem with federal constitutional law” under Roe v. Wade, Manian said. The supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution says federal law trumps conflicting state and local law.
