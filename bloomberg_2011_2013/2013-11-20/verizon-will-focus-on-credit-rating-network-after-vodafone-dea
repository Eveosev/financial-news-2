Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  will
focus on bolstering its mobile network and  credit rating  after
the $130 billion deal to take control of its wireless business
closes next year, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said.  The company plans to return to its A- credit  rating  in the
next four or five years after completing the biggest takeover in
more than a decade, Shammo said at an industry conference in
Barcelona today. Verizon is also going to add capacity to its
fourth-generation wireless network in areas such as  New York ,
where parts of the infrastructure have been overwhelmed.  “We need to de-lever as quickly as possible,” Shammo
said. “We are going to continue to invest in our network and
our platforms. We’re going to continue to acquire spectrum,
which we need to deliver our wireless performance.”  Verizon, based in New York, agreed to buy out Vodafone
Group Plc from its wireless business this year. By owning 100
percent of  Verizon Wireless , the largest and most profitable
U.S. wireless carrier, the company will keep all the earnings
and give it more leeway to make network improvements.  The proxies for a shareholder meeting on the acquisition
will be filed in December and investors are expected to vote in
January, Shammo said at the conference organized by Morgan
Stanley.  Standard & Poor’s rates Verizon BBB+, one level below A-.  Verizon plans to participate in spectrum auctions in the
U.S. and is still receptive to offers for its so-called A-block
spectrum put up for sale last year, Shammo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
