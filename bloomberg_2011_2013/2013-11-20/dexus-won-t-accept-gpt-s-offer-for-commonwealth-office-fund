Dexus Property Group (DXS) ,  Australia ’s
 biggest  listed office landlord, said it won’t accept GPT Group’s
A$1.27-a-share offer to take over  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia ’s office trust, in which it has a 15 percent interest.  Dexus will continue with due diligence of its own bid, made
in partnership with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board,
the Sydney-based company said in a statement to the stock
exchange today. GPT’s offer needs the acceptance of 50.1 percent
of  Commonwealth Property Office Fund’s (CPA)  shareholders to succeed.  Dexus and GPT are fighting for control of the trust, which
has A$3.9 billion ($3.6 billion) of office buildings across
Australia’s biggest cities, to boost their assets under
management and increase the quality of their property
portfolios. Dexus in July agreed to buy its 14.9 percent stake
in CPA, as the fund is known, the day after Commonwealth Bank
said it would exit property management.  “Dexus has taken tactical moves beforehand, and this is
where there’s scope for them to exploit them,” said Tony
Sherlock, Sydney-based head of property research at Morningstar
Australasia Pty. “Dexus’s bid is at the upper end of most
investors’ comfort range, so I’m not anticipating a sweetened
offer from Dexus. But that’s not to say that more offshore money
couldn’t come in.”  GPT Offer  GPT (GPT)  said this week that it has an agreement in place to
sell A$1.1 billion of CPA’s buildings to GPT’s unlisted office
fund should it be able to proceed with compulsory acquisition of
all shares in the office trust. Dexus’s move today blocks GPT
from proceeding with that part of its plan, Dexus said.  “If you end up being a minority shareholder in a
reasonably illiquid vehicle, I’m not sure what the benefits are
to you,” GPT Managing Director Michael Cameron told investors
yesterday. “Particularly if you’ve gone beyond the point of
accepting our bid, you’ve sort of missed out on that opportunity
as well. That’d be a bad situation to be in.”  GPT may restructure its arrangement with its unlisted fund,
enabling it to sell the buildings despite Dexus’s blocking
stake, Sherlock said. If GPT is successful, Dexus is likely to
sell its shares, he said.  GPT’s bid this week compared with a sweetened Nov. 11 cash-and-share proposal equal to A$1.2052-a-share made by Dexus and
the Canadian pension fund, which was backed by CPA’s manager
after it rejected their first A$1.15-a-share offer last month.  The Canadian fund remains committed to the proposal, Dexus
said today. The company reserves the right to change its mind if
new information about GPT’s bid emerges, Dexus said.  Dexus  shares  closed 1.4 percent lower at A$1.05 and CPA
shares rose 0.4 percent to A$1.265 in Sydney today. GPT
securities fell 1.7 percent to A$3.50, compared with a 0.4
percent drop in the benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index. (AS51)   To contact the reporter on this story:
