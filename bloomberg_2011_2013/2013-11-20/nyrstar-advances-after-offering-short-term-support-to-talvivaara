Nyrstar (NYR)  NV rose in Brussels, ending
a 10-day slump, as the smelter offered short-term support to
supplier  Talvivaara Mining Co. (TALV)  and said it wouldn’t breach
financing agreements in the event of an impairment.  Nyrstar advanced as much as 12 percent, the biggest gain
since Sept. 14, 2012, after losing almost a third of its value
in two weeks. The company was up 9.5 percent at 2.30 euros as of
1:52 p.m. in Brussels.  Talvivaara, a Finnish nickel miner with an off-take
agreement with Nyrstar, on Nov. 15 filed for a corporate
reorganization to raise funds and avoid bankruptcy. Nyrstar in
2010 agreed to pay $335 million for all of Talvivaara’s zinc
concentrate until 1.25 million metric tons is delivered. It
received 13,700 tons this year to the end of October.  “Talvivaara’s filing for corporate restructuring created a
lot of speculation on its sustainability and the impact for
Nyrstar,” Wouter Vanderhaeghen, an analyst at KBC Securities NV
in Brussels, wrote today in a note. “In a worst case scenario
where Talvivaara goes bankrupt, we believe that Nyrstar would
lose around 10 percent to  15 percent  of its” earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.  Talvivaara, which has suffered from weakening nickel prices
and a slow production ramp-up at its mine in northern  Finland ,
failed to raise additional cash from investors for a voluntary
reorganization, it said last week. Some investors declined to
provide more funds and others decided to wait until a corporate
reorganization is completed, Talvivaara said.  Balance Sheet  An impairment to the Talvivaara asset on Nyrstar’s balance
sheet wouldn’t lead to a breach of financing arrangements, the
smelter said today. Nyrstar’s outstanding bonds don’t have
covenants and it’s “comfortably” within balance sheet-related
covenants on a 400 million-euro revolving facility.  Its 525 million euros of 5.375 percent notes due May 2016
rose 3.279, or 32.79 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 74.196
today, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Nyrstar has been in discussion with Talvivaara since it
filed for restructuring and is seeking to provide operational
and “other support” to the Finnish miner, it said today. “Any
other support that would be offered by Nyrstar would only be
limited and short term in nature, and would be subject to a
number of conditions that Nyrstar believes are necessary to
restructure the company and its operations.”  Bankruptcy would result in 1,600 lost jobs, Talvivaara
Chief Executive Officer Pekka Pera said last week. He declined
to say whether it received or sought any acquisition approaches.  Talvivaara withdrew a 2013 output forecast of 18,000 tons
in July after producing 4,508 tons of nickel in the first half.
It produced 2,595 tons of the metal and 5,645 tons of zinc in
the third quarter. At current prices, it needs to produce 30,000
tons of nickel a year to be profitable, Pera said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
