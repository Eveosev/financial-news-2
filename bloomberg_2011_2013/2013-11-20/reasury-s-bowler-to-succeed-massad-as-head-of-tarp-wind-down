U.S. Treasury Department official
Timothy J. Bowler will manage the wind-down of the Troubled
Asset Relief Program after its current head leaves to run the
nation’s derivatives regulator, an agency official said.  Bowler, previously deputy assistant secretary for capital
markets, will become acting assistant secretary in the Office of
Financial Stability when Timothy Massad, the Obama
administration’s nominee to become chairman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, leaves the Treasury.  Bowler, 40, has worked on capital markets, investment and
housing issues for the department, according to the Treasury
official, who requested anonymity to discuss personnel matters.
Previously, he served as a managing director at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co. before joining the
Treasury in 2011.  Massad was chosen by President  Barack Obama  last week to
replace Gary Gensler as head of the CFTC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
