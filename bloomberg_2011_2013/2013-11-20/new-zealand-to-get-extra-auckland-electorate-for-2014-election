New Zealand  will get an extra
electorate in Auckland, while boundaries will shift in
Christchurch reflecting population movement after the 2011
earthquakes.  The new boundaries, based on latest census figures, were
proposed by the Representation Commission today for next year’s
general election and for 2017. The number of general electorates
will increase to 71 from 70, with Auckland accounting for 24,
the Commission said in a statement. The public has until Dec. 23
to review the proposed boundaries and make objections.  Auckland is home to a third of New Zealand’s 4.5 million
people and was the fastest-growing region since the last
boundary review in 2007, according to the commission. Two new
seats are being created in the north and west of the city and
the existing Waitakere electorate -- currently held by Social
Development Minister Paula Bennett -- is being replaced.  The Christchurch earthquake led to an exodus from eastern
parts of the city to western suburbs and outlying areas, leaving
several seats larger than the permitted population limit, the
commission said.  Across the country, 43 electorates face changes while 27,
including all seven Maori seats, are unchanged.  Under New Zealand’s mixed-member-proportional system,
people have an electorate vote and a party vote. The makeup of
the 120-seat parliament is determined by each party’s share of
the party vote, with the 71 winning electorate candidates joined
by 49 from party lists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
