Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures dropped
after benchmark indexes climbed to a two-week high yesterday.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for November delivery fell 0.3
percent to 6,214 at 10:18 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index gained 0.2 percent to 6,203.35 yesterday, the
highest close since Nov. 6. The S&P BSE Sensex also increased
0.2 percent. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of
U.S.-traded shares declined for the first time in five days,
losing 1.6 percent.  Indian policy makers are grappling with the fastest
inflation among 17 Asia-Pacific economies tracked by Bloomberg
and an economy forecast to grow at the slowest pace in more than
a decade this fiscal year. A three-month, $5.67-billion surge of
international money into Indian stocks has helped the Sensex
rally 17 percent since slumping to a one-year low in August.  “Weak local macros will continue to counter strong
liquidity flows,” Suhas Naik, chief operating officer at
Mumbai-based IL&FS Portfolio Management Services Ltd., which
oversees $100 million in assets, said by phone yesterday. “The
markets will continue to be volatile in the near term.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index swung between gains and losses
today after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said low
U.S. interest rates will continue long after the central bank
ends its program of bond buying.  International investors bought a net $142.5 million of
local shares on Nov. 18, a 30th straight day of purchases and
the longest consecutive inflow since the 35 days through Feb.
15, according to data from the market regulator.  Foreign funds have bought $17.1 billion of Indian stocks
this year, the second-highest inflow after Japan among 10 Asian
markets tracked by Bloomberg.  The Sensex has gained 7.5 percent this year and trades at
13.7 times projected 12-month profits, compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.7 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
