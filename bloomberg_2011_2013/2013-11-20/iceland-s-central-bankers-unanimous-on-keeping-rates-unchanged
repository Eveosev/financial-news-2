Members of the Icelandic central
bank’s monetary policy board were unanimous on keeping its
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6 percent at its Nov. 4-5
meetings.  “Committee members agreed that if wage increases were in
line with the forecast, it would probably be necessary to raise
the bank’s nominal interest rates,” according to the  minutes 
published in Reykjavik today. “Particularly if the margin of
spare capacity in the economy continued to narrow.”  Governor Mar Gudmundsson “proposed that rates be held
unchanged” and all five board members voted in favor of the
proposal. “Two members expressed mounting concern, however, at
the persistence of inflation and inflation expectations,” the
minutes showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
