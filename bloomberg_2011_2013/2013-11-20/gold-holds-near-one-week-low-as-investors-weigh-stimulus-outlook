Gold traded near a one-week low as
investors weighed the outlook for monetary stimulus before the
 Federal Reserve  releases minutes of its last meeting and a
report that may show U.S. consumer prices stagnated last month.  Bullion for immediate delivery traded at $1,274.83 an ounce
at 10:17 a.m. in  Singapore  from $1,275.65 yesterday, when prices
fell to $1,269.32, the lowest since Nov. 13. Gold for December
delivery was little changed at $1,273.80 on the Comex.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday
that while the U.S. labor market has improved since the start of
the bank’s bond-buying program, a “preponderance of data”
would be needed to begin removing accommodation. The Fed is due
to publish minutes of its October meeting today. Consumer prices
probably stagnated last month after increasing 0.2 percent in
September, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  “The concern is that we start to build on this
deflationary feeling that nothing is happening,” said  Jonathan Barratt , chief executive officer of Barratt’s Bulletin in
Sydney. “The ETF market is continuing with sales, moms and dads
are getting out and getting into other things. There’s no real
 risk premium  attributed to gold at the moment.”  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest bullion-backed
exchange-traded product, dropped to 863.01 tons yesterday, the
lowest since February 2009, according to data on its website.
Gold tumbled 24 percent this year, while global  equities  climbed
18 percent.  Asset Purchases  Fed policy makers will probably pare the pace of monthly
asset purchases to $70 billion from $85 billion at their March
meeting, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
The benchmark  interest rate  will probably stay low long after
the purchases end, according to Bernanke.  Silver for immediate delivery lost as much as 0.6 percent
to $20.2588 an ounce, before trading little changed at $20.396.
Prices dropped to $20.2254 yesterday, the lowest since Aug. 9.  Platinum fell as much as 0.5 percent to $1,411.60 an ounce
and was at $1,414.47. The metal touched $1,405.15 yesterday, the
lowest since Oct. 17. Palladium advanced 0.3 percent to $722.59
an ounce, extending a rebound from yesterday’s low of $713.03,
the lowest since Oct. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
