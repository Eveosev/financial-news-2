Sharp Corp. (6753)  is considering a
photocopier-business partnership with  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ,
according to a person familiar with the situation.  The companies are still discussing the terms, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public. Sharp  advanced  7.6 percent, the most since July 2,
to close at 299 yen in Tokyo trading.  “Negotiations were not announced by the company,” said
 Miyuki Nakayama , a spokeswoman for  Osaka , Japan-based Sharp. She
declined to elaborate.  Reuters reported earlier that Sharp may manufacture
machines under the Hewlett-Packard brand, according to the
potential agreement.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Asia’s biggest technology company,
said in March its offer to buy Sharp’s photocopier business was
rejected. The price wasn’t disclosed.  Today’s advance pared Sharp’s decline this year to 1.3
percent. The broader Topix index has surged 43 percent in the
same period, while Panasonic Corp. has doubled and Sony Corp.
has jumped 95 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
