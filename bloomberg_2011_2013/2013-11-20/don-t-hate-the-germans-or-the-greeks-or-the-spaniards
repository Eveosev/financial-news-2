I wanted to highlight a piece by  Brendan Greeley of Bloomberg Businessweek  on the German legacy of sacrifice and how that colors disputes within the euro area: There’s been a tendency for people in the euro fight to take sides: to view Germans as bloodsucking leeches determined to shake every last penny out of the pockets of poor southerners or, contrariwise, to think of Greeks and Spaniards as profligate deadbeats who are freeloading off their more prudent neighbors.  The truth is more like one of those intricate marital disputes in which the grievances go back decades, with some truth to all the accusations being hurled back and forth. The Spaniards and the Greeks did make mistakes -- and the ordinary people are suffering in order to keep German banks healthy -- and everyone is being asked to sacrifice more than they’d planned, or feel willing to, in order to keep the marriage together. You might be able to imagine a better resolution on strict utilitarian grounds. But when was any marital dispute ever resolved on strict utilitarian grounds?
