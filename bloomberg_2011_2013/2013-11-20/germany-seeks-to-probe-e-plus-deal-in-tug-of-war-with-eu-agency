Germany’s antitrust regulator sought
the right to probe  Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s purchase of  Royal KPN NV (KPN) ’s E-Plus unit, setting up a possible tug of war with the European
Union over who reviews the deal.  The Federal Cartel Office today lodged the request at the
Brussels-based European Commission with the backing of the
government, Andreas Mundt, the authority’s president, said in an
e-mailed  statement .  “The merger has effects exclusively on the German mobile-phone market,” said Mundt. “So a referral would be the right
way.” The commission has 35 working days from the initial
 notification  at the end of last month to adopt a referral
decision or deal with the case itself, the cartel office said.  The 8.55 billion-euro ($11.6 billion) sale, which will
merge the two companies’ German units, is one of two deals that
may transform the country’s telecommunications industry once
dominated by Deutsche Telekom AG. EU regulators have already
given the go ahead to  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s bid for  Kabel
Deutschland Holding AG. (KD8)   EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said on Sept.
13 the deal should be handled by his unit, not by the Germans.
The Bonn-based Cartel Office is concerned that the transaction
would reduce the number of mobile-phone providers in the country
from four to three.  Antoine Colombani, Almunia’s spokesman, said by e-mail that
the commission received the German request and would examine it.  To contact the reporters on this story:
