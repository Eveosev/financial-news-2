Republican Representative  Dave Camp 
won’t attempt to change estate and gift taxes as he tries to
make the biggest alterations to the U.S. tax system since 1986.  “I don’t think that policy needs the reform that the rest
of the code does,” the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways
and Means Committee told reporters in the Capitol today.  Many Republicans and business groups want to repeal the
estate tax, and they spent more than a decade trying to achieve
that goal. The tax disappeared in 2010 under a temporary law
before returning in 2011, and repeal is unlikely with a
Democratic Senate and president.  Congress this year set the top estate rate at 40 percent
with a $5.25 million per-person exemption that’s indexed for
inflation. That means about 0.1 percent of people who die this
year will owe estate taxes, according to the  Tax Policy Center 
in  Washington .  The tax will raise about $14.2 billion this year, according
to the center.  President  Barack Obama  wants to lower the exemption to $3.5
million and raise the top rate to 45 percent starting in 2018.
Along with other changes proposed by Obama, this would increase
estate and gift taxes by $79 billion over the next decade,
according to the Treasury Department.  Camp, of  Michigan , had said he would release a tax bill
this year that would lower individual and corporate income tax
rates and curtail tax breaks. In recent weeks, he has suggested
that he may miss that deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
