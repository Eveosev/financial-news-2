Gasoline futures headed for a fourth
consecutive decline after an industry report showed supplies
rose last week.  Prices retreated as much as 0.7 percent after the  American
Petroleum Institute  said yesterday that U.S. inventories of
gasoline climbed 84,000 barrels in the seven days ended Nov. 15.
A government report may show today that  stockpiles  fell 300,000
barrels, according to the median estimate of 11 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Prices are reacting to the API inventories, which showed
a surprise build in gasoline,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for December delivery slid 1.4 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.6255 a gallon at 9:51 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 3.1 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures are down 6.6 percent in 2013.  U.S.  pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.3 cent to
$3.212 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today. That’s
20 cents below a year ago.  The fuel’s crack spread to West Texas Intermediate oil
narrowed 22 cents to $17.30 a barrel. Gasoline’s  premium  to
European benchmark Brent oil slipped 18 cents to $2.94.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel added 0.37 cent to $2.9095 a gallon
on the Nymex.  ULSD’s  crack spread  to WTI gained 48 cents to $29.18 a
barrel, while the  price gap  versus Brent climbed 38 cents to
$15.53 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
