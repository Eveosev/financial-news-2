Palm oil  advanced for the first time
in three days on speculation that exports from  Malaysia  may
rebound amid forecasts for rains that may hamper harvests.  The contract for delivery in February gained 0.9 percent to
close at 2,580 ringgit ($811) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, rebounding from a 2.2 percent loss in the previous
two sessions.  Exports from Malaysia dropped 2 percent to 1 million tons
in the first 20 days of November from the same period a month
earlier, surveyor Intertek said today. That compares with a 13
percent drop in the first 10 days of the month. Abundant
rainfall in November may cause prolonged soil saturation that
will affect crop growth or yields, especially in low-lying areas
with possibility of flooding, the Malaysian Meteorological
Department said Nov. 15.  “Gains in palm were driven by the export data, which
showed the narrowing of the month-on-month decline,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment bank Bhd., by phone from  Kuala
Lumpur . “This suggests a pick up in demand and lower-than-expected stockpiles. Market is also taking cues from improved
prices of competing oils.”  Prices also gained on weather concerns and fears of
flooding in the plantations, said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a
director with Commtrendz Risk Management Services.  Soybeans for January delivery were little changed at
$12.7675 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil 
gained 0.5 percent to 40.42 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for May delivery increased 0.8 percent to
close at 6,268  yuan  ($1,029) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  and soybean oil climbed 0.4 percent to end at 7,184
yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
