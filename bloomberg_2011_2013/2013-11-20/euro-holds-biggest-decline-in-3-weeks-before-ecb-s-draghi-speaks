The yen weakened past 101 per dollar
for the first time since July as yields on U.S. securities rose
to the highest relative to  Japan ’s since September amid the
nations’ diverging monetary policies.  The euro rose to a four-year high versus Japan’s currency
as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  damped
speculation of negative deposit rates. The yen fell versus most
major peers after the  Bank of Japan  stuck to its pledge to
expand the monetary base a day after the  Federal Reserve 
signaled a reduction in asset purchases “in coming months.”
The franc fell against the euro as a  Swiss National Bank (SNBN)  board
member said the central bank will maintain the currency’s cap.  “The Federal Open Market Committee minutes yesterday have
opened the door for December tapering again, and you’re seeing
some dollar support,”  Michael Woolfolk , a global-markets
strategist at Bank of  New York  Mellon in New York, said in a
phone interview. “On the other hand in Japan, there seems no
end in sight for their monetary easing.”  The yen fell 1.1 percent to 101.16 per dollar at 5 p.m. New
York time, the weakest level since July 10. Japan’s currency
slid 1.4 percent to 136.37 per euro after declining to 136.40,
the lowest since October 2009. The euro rose 0.3 percent to
$1.3482.  The Bloomberg  U.S. Dollar  Index, which tracks the currency
against 10 major counterparts, rose 0.2 percent to 1,020.97
after advancing 0.4 percent yesterday. The dollar gauge breached
its 100- and 200-day  moving averages  as it approached a two-month high.  Franc, Aussie  SNB board member Fritz Zurbruegg said today in Geneva the
upper limit on the haven franc “remain a necessary instrument
for the foreseeable future.” Citing the risk of deflation and a
recession, Zurich-based central bank set a cap of 1.20 per euro
on the currency in September 2011, threatening unlimited
interventions to defend it.  The Swiss currency was at 1.2307 per euro, from 1.2313
yesterday. It rallied 1.5 percent to 110.81 yen, another refuge
destination, the biggest jump in two months and the highest
level since August 1990.  The Australian dollar fell the most in four months versus
the U.S. currency as Reserve Bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  said in
Sydney he was “open-minded” on intervention. The currency
climbed almost 50 percent in the four years ended Dec. 31 as the
nation escaped the 2009 global recession and a China-led mining
investment boom spurred growth.  The Aussie dropped 1.1 percent to 92.34 U.S. cents after
sliding to 91.99 cents, the weakest since Sept. 9.  Rupiah, Ringgit  Emerging-market currencies plunged after minutes of the
Fed’s Oct. 29-30 meeting released yesterday showed policy makers
“generally expected” improvement in employment data that would
“warrant trimming the pace of purchases in coming months.” The
central bank buys $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed
securities a month. The Fed next meets on Dec. 17-18.  Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped to the lowest level in more than
four years. The currency fell 0.4 percent to 11,703 per dollar,
prices from local banks showed. It reached 11,733 earlier, the
weakest level since March 31, 2009.  Malaysia’s ringgit fell by the most in two months, tumbling
0.7 percent to 3.2050 per dollar. That’s the biggest drop since
Sept. 30.  “These minutes should provide some support for the U.S.
dollar,” David de Garis, a senior economist at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in  Melbourne , wrote in a note to clients.
“Tapering expectations look only to have been delayed somewhat,
with perhaps the Fed only one or two further good payroll
numbers away from beginning to reduce its asset purchases.”  ‘Yield Differential’  Japan’s central bank kept its pledge to expand the monetary
base by as much as 70 trillion yen ($69 billion) a year at
today’s meeting. Nineteen of 37 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
said policy makers will add stimulus in the second quarter of
2014 after a planned increase in  sales tax , with seven saying it
will ease in the July-September period.  The  extra yield  on 10-year U.S. Treasuries over their
similar-maturity Japanese counterparts expanded to 2.19
percentage points yesterday, the widest since Sept. 12 based on
closing prices, and was at 2.16 today.  “The yield differential is a key driver of dollar-yen,”
Brian Daingerfield, a  Stamford , Connecticut-based currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities
unit, said in a phone interview. “The dollar, reacting
positively towards the possibility of an earlier taper and
yields moving higher, are pushing dollar-yen higher.”  Relative Strength  The yen tumbled 12 percent this year, the worst performer
of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 3.9 percent and
the euro advanced 6.5 percent.  The Japanese currency’s 14-day relative strength index
against the greenback was at 69.8 today, approaching the 70
threshold which indicates the currency’s decline may be losing
momentum.  Currency volatility increased for a third day with the
JPMorgan Chase & Co. Group of Seven Volatility Index climbing as
high as 8.07 percent, the most since Nov. 14.  The euro rose, paring yesterday’s 0.7 percent drop versus
the dollar, after the ECB’s Draghi said policy makers haven’t
changed their mind on a negative deposit rate since they cut the
benchmark rate to a record low on Nov. 7.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $58 billion, from $57 billion yesterday, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $20 billion, the largest share of
trades at 35 percent. Options on the Aussie-dollar rate totaled
$5.8 billion, or 10 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 101 percent more than the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Aussie-greenback options
trading was 125 percent above average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
