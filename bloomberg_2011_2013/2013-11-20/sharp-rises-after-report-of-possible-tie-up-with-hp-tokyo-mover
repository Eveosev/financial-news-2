Sharp Corp. (6753) , the Japanese
electronics maker that reported a record loss last year,  climbed 
the most in four months in Tokyo trading after a report it was
considering a tie-up with  Hewlett-Packard (HPQ)  Co. in photocopiers.  Shares advanced 7.6 percent, the most since July 2, to
close at 299 yen after Kyodo News published a one-line dispatch
on its English-language website.  “The report is not announced by the company,” said Sharp
spokesman Yoshifumi Seki. “I cannot comment on business with
specific companies.” Michael Thacker, a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard, declined to comment.  “It’s positive for Sharp if it can close the deal,” said
Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo.
“Photocopier margins are high, so if they increase sales,
profit will also increase.”  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Asia’s biggest technology company,
said in March its offer to buy Sharp’s photocopier business was
rejected. The price wasn’t disclosed.  Today’s advance pared Sharp’s decline this year to 1.3
percent. The broader Topix index has surged 43 percent in the
same period, Panasonic Corp. has  doubled  and Sony Corp. has
jumped 95 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
