Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  Chief
Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio will receive a bonus
valued at about 2.25 million pounds ($3.6 million) after meeting
his target for increasing the bank’s share price today,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Horta-Osorio will get the award for 2012 because the price
has exceeded the average paid by the U.K. government of 73.6
pence for 30 consecutive trading days, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The
award will be deferred until 2018.  Lloyds fell 0.08 percent to 75.02 pence in  London  today. At
that price, Horta-Osorio’s 3 million-share award is valued at
about 2.25 million pounds. The stock has gained 57 percent this
year.  Horta-Osorio, 49, has been seeking to strengthen the
lender’s balance sheet by selling assets, cutting costs and
eliminating jobs after the bank received a 20 billion-pound
bailout amid the 2008 financial crisis. The government sold
about 3.2 billion pounds of shares in September to reduce its
stake to 33 percent.  “Antonio’s bonus, which he won’t receive until 2018,
reflects the significant turnaround at Lloyds under his
leadership, something that has enabled taxpayers to start
getting back their money at a profit,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement.  -- Editors: Jon Menon,  Keith Campbell   To contact the reporter on this story:
