CME Group Inc.’s Comex halted
trading in December gold futures for about 20 seconds today at
6:26:41 a.m. New York time, said Damon Leavell, a spokesman for
the exchange.  The December contract fell about $11 within a minute before
trading was suspended, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Leavell
declined to comment on the size of the trade that led to the
halt. The “stop-logic” mechanism gives traders the opportunity
to provide additional liquidity and prevent excessive price
movements.  Gold prices dropped 24 percent this year through yesterday,
heading for the biggest annual drop since 1981. Prices plunged
into a bear market in April as equities rallied and amid concern
that the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of its stimulus
program, eroding demand for the metal as a hedge against
inflation. The U.S. central bank is scheduled to publish minutes
of its October meeting today.  “We are seeing continued liquidation in gold,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Any
sudden drop in prices makes people nervous.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1 percent to
$1,260.90 an ounce at 9:35 a.m. on the Comex in New York, after
touching a one-month low of $1,258.  To contact the reporter on this story:
