Fossil-fuel subsidies paid by
industrial nations are more than five times the climate aid
provided to poorer nations that need funds to reduce emissions
and adapt to global warming, a study showed.  Industrialized countries paid $58.7 billion in 2011 in
subsidies to the oil, coal and natural gas industries and to
consumers of the fuels. That compares with climate-aid averaging
$11.7 billion a year from 2010 to 2012, the Washington-based
campaign group Oil Change International said today in a report
released in Warsaw.  Eliminating the subsidies would help countries cut the
greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming and provide
funds to help poor nations cope with higher temperatures. Envoys
at United Nations climate talks in the Polish capital intend to
craft a new agreement by 2015. At the same time, richer
countries are trying to meet a pledge to provide $100 billion a
year in climate aid by 2020.  “The world is in a deep hole with climate change, and the
first thing to do in a hole is to stop digging,” Stephen
Kretzmann, the founder of Oil Change International, said in an
e-mail. “Governments are not only still digging, they’re still
spending at least five times more in taxpayer support to dig
more than they are to climb out.”  Today’s report used the same figure for fossil fuel
subsidies from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development as it did in a similar study last year, while
lifting the estimate of climate aid from $11.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
