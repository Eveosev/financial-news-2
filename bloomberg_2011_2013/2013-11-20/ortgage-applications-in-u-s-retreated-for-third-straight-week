highest since September. The refinancing gauge declined 6.5
percent to the weakest since mid-September.  The  average rate  on a 30-year fixed loan increased to 4.46
percent last week, the highest in a month, from 4.44 percent.
The rate on a 15-year loan was unchanged at 3.52 percent.  The share of applicants looking to refinance decreased to
64.3 percent, the lowest since the period ended Oct. 4, from
66.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
