Ethanol futures climbed to a seven-week high as demand in the physical market improved amid
declining U.S. inventories.  Ethanol advanced 5.7 percent after  stockpiles  declined for
a second straight week, dropping 0.5 percent to 15.1 million
barrels for the period ended Nov. 15, the Energy Information
Administration said today. Production slid 2.5 percent to
904,000 barrels a day.  “There’s strong demand in the cash market today,” Jim Damask, a manager at Starfuels Inc. said in a telephone
interview from Jupiter,  Florida . “The discount to gasoline is
attractive.”  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel tightened 8.05 cents
to 72.3 cents, based on settlement prices for ethanol and
gasoline futures.  Denatured ethanol for December rose 10.4 cents to settle at
$1.94 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the highest level
since Sept. 30. Prices have dropped 11 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery gained 2.35 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.663 a gallon at the close on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to gasoline
stations.  In cash market trading, ethanol climbed 12.5 cent to $2.45
a gallon in  New York  and 15 cents to $2.375 in Chicago,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prices advanced 14.5
cents to $2.47 on the  Gulf Coast  and 13 cents to $2.455 a gallon
on the West Coast.  Cash Market  West Coast ethanol’s discount to the Gulf was 1.5 cents,
compared with parity yesterday. Chicago’s discount to New York
narrowed 2.5 cents to 7.5 cents.  U.S. ethanol inventories have dropped by 20 percent in the
past year, while output has soared 11 percent, EIA data shows.  “Stocks just declined slightly compared to output” this
week,  Jason Ward , a market analyst for Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. said today in a telephone interview from
 Minneapolis . “We’re not building stocks because there’s a
healthy demand from the discount-to-gasoline side.”  The Environmental Protection Agency tracks compliance with
the government mandate for biofuel blending with Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs, certificates assigned to each
gallon that are submitted to the agency and can be traded among
refiners.  Generation of U.S. corn ethanol RINs jumped to a 21-month
high of 1.17 billion gallons in October, the EPA said Nov. 19.
Output of advanced ethanol RINs, which included biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, slumped by about half, to 29.8
million gallons, from 65.1 million gallons in September.  RINS Trading  Corn-based RINs rose 1 cent to 19 cents today, the first
increase since Nov. 6, while advanced RINs fell 2 cents to 20
cents.  December-delivery corn, the main raw material for ethanol,
fell 0.75 cent to $4.17 a bushel. The December crush spread of
corn to ethanol was 43 cents, up from 32 cents yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The EPA is proposing to push the renewable fuels mandate
for next year to 15.21 billion gallons, including 13 billion for
corn ethanol. That compares with an overall 18.15 billion
gallons set in the 2007 law. A final rule is due in the first
quarter of next year, after refiners and ethanol producers weigh
in, the agency said Nov. 15.  The first of the  public hearings  is scheduled for Dec. 5 in
 Washington , according to the Federal Register.  Oil refiner  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ) , based in  Dallas , got a
waiver to comply with RINs requirements this year for its Krotz
Springs refinery, according to a November investor presentation
released today. The refinery was exempted from the renewable
fuel requirement in 2012 too, according to a separate filing on
Aug. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
