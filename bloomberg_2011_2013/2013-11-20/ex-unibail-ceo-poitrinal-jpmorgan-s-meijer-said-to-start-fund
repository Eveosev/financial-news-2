Guillaume Poitrinal, former  Unibail-Rodamco SE (UL)  chairman and chief executive officer, plans to set up
a property fund with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  real estate analyst
 Harm Meijer , two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Information about the fund and what it will invest in will
be announced early next year, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the matter isn’t yet public. The fund may
have a third founding partner, they said.  Poitrinal, 45, ran Unibail-Rodamco, the largest European
real estate investment trust, from 2005 until he stepped down in
April. The Paris-based company operates malls in 12 countries.
Poitrinal didn’t respond to a text message requesting comment
and his phone was busy.  Meijer has been the top-rated European real estate analyst
in the annual Thomson Reuters Extel ratings for the past five
years. Meijer declined to comment on his role with the fund.  Tim Leckie was appointed to succeed Meijer as head of
JPMorgan’s team of European real estate analysts today, one of
the people said.  The news was reported earlier today by CoStar Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
