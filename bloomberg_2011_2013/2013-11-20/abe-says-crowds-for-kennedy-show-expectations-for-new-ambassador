The large crowd that turned out to
greet Caroline Kennedy as she took up her post as the top U.S.
diplomat to Japan reflects the anticipation over her
ambassadorship, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said.  “I was watching the ceremony where you presented your
credentials to his majesty the emperor; I don’t believe we have
ever seen such a large number of people turn out to see a new
ambassador,” Abe said after meeting Kennedy today in  Tokyo .
“This shows the high expectations the Japanese people have of
you.”  Kennedy’s background as the only living child of former
U.S. President  John F. Kennedy  and her ties to President  Barack Obama  have heightened attention on her appointment. Her father
had hoped to become the first sitting U.S. president to visit
Japan before he was assassinated in Dallas 50 years ago this
week.  Kennedy, 55, traveled to the Imperial Palace yesterday in a
century-old, horse drawn carriage, as thousands of Japanese
waved and snapped pictures, to present her credentials and a
letter from President Obama to Emperor Akihito.  The ceremony “was a great tribute to the relationship
between the  United States  and Japan, and I was very honored by
the warm welcome I received,” Kennedy told Abe today.  Abe also said that Japan was sending 1,000 troops to the
 Philippines  and that he looked forward to the Japanese forces
working with their U.S. counterparts to provide relief to
survivors of Typhoon Haiyan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
