U.S. Bancorp (USB) , the nation’s biggest
regional lender by assets, is partnering with  American Express
Co. (AXP)  to offer credit cards accepted on AmEx’s network.  American Express, the largest credit-card issuer by
customer purchases, will help design programs for customers of
Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp beginning in the second half of
2014, the Minneapolis-based lender said today in a statement.  “The American Express network provides a combination of
benefits and services that many of our customers want,” Pam Joseph, vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp, said in the statement.  Wells Fargo & Co., the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said
in August it teamed up with New York-based American Express to
begin a similar card program in select U.S. markets this year,
before offering all customers a full plan starting in the first
half of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
