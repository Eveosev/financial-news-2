Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN)  is selling
its entire stake in New China Life Insurance Co. for $943
million, or HK$25 a share, according to the terms of the deal
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Switzerland’s biggest insurer is offering 292.5 million  New
China Life (1336)  shares, representing 9.4 percent of the total issued
share capital of the Chinese company, the terms show.  Zurich Insurance sold 97.5 million shares in the third-largest Chinese life insurer by premium income in July, causing
the stock to drop 6.4 percent, and booked a gain of $441 million
in 2011 after selling an initial 5 percent stake to China
International Capital Corp. and Nomura Securities Co. The sale
reflected a “desire to manage our financial exposure to a
business we do not control,” Zurich Insurance said at the time.  The insurer said it agreed to sell 52.3 percent of today’s
share sale to an unidentified investor, while also entering into
a placing agreement with investment banks for the remainder,
according to an e-mailed  statement  from the Zurich-based
insurer. The company said it plans to complete the sale on Nov.
