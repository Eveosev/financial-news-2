The  San Francisco Giants  signed
pitcher Tim Hudson to a two-year contract, adding the 38-year-old, three-time All-Star to a starting rotation that includes
 Matt Cain ,  Tim Lincecum  and Madison Bumgarner.  The Giants, who missed the postseason this year after
winning the World Series in 2012, didn’t disclose financial
terms of Hudson’s contract. The San Francisco Chronicle reported
that he’ll receive $23 million over two years.  Hudson started his Major League Baseball career in the San
Francisco Bay Area in 1999 with the Oakland Athletics, with whom
he played until 2004. The right-hander spent the past nine
seasons with the Atlanta Braves and had an 8-7 record with a
3.97 earned run average in 21 starts this year.  Hudson is one of three active pitchers with more than 200
wins, along with CC Sabathia and  Roy Halladay , and has logged a
205-111 career record with a 3.44 ERA. Hudson has had at least
15 wins in eight of his 15 seasons and his .649 winning
percentage ranks as the third-best among active pitchers behind
Halladay (.659) and Jered Weaver (.653).  To contact the reporter on this story:
