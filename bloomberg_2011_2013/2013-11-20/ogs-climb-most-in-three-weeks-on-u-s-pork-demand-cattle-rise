Hog futures jumped the most in three
weeks amid speculation that U.S. pork demand is improving,
spurring meatpackers to buy more animals. Cattle prices
increased.  Pork processors slaughtered 1.31 million animals this week,
up 4.7 percent from a week earlier and 1.3 percent more than a
year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Hog
carcass weights declined for the third straight day to 211.1
pounds (95.76 kilograms), according to the USDA.  “Pork demand is holding up pretty well,”  Dan Vaught , an
economist at Doane Advisory Services in St. Louis, said in a
telephone interview. “The thought that we were going to get
swamped with fat hogs was wrong.”  Hog futures for February settlement climbed 1.1 percent to
close at 90.925 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, the biggest gain for the contract since
Oct. 28.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$1.3195 a pound on the CME. Prices tumbled 2.3 percent the
previous two days.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement gained 0.2
percent to $1.6275 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
