California is poised to shake off a
legacy of budget deficits with an operating surplus more than
doubling to $2.2 billion by the end of June on tax increases and
gains in stocks, the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s
Office said.  The surplus, projected to reach $3.2 billion in the
following year, should be used to expand programs and pay down
$6.6 billion in recurring borrowing that Democratic Governor
 Jerry Brown  calls a “wall of debt,” the analyst said today in
a  report .  Income taxes in the most populous U.S. state, fueled
largely by  capital gains  from the performance of the stock
market, provide the biggest share of revenue. Voters in 2012
raised rates to 13.3 percent on those making $1 million or more,
the most of any state, and boosted sales levies.  “The state’s budgetary condition is stronger than at any
point in the past decade,” Legislative Analyst Mac Taylor said
in the report. “The state’s structural deficit —- in which
ongoing spending commitments were greater than projected
revenues -— is no more.”  The Standard & Poor’s index of shares has gained about 25
percent this year, after a 13.4 percent increase in 2012.
Income-tax revenue covered 61 percent of general-fund spending
last year.  The state’s relative borrowing costs have declined this
year as its fiscal outlook has improved.  Investors demand about 0.35 percentage point of extra yield
to own 10-year California debt rather than top-rated bonds, down
from a gap of about 0.6 percentage point in January, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Phase Out  The state’s revenue growth will slow when the temporary 
sales tax increase lapses in 2016 and the higher rates on 
incomes starting at $250,000 expire in 2018, the analyst said.  Brown, 75, forecast an $817 million surplus this year, the
first in almost a decade, marking a turnaround after the state
had strained under more than $100 billion of cumulative deficits
since 2007.  Standard & Poor’s  raised the state’s credit rating to A,
sixth-highest, in January, the first boost since 2006.  Fitch
Ratings  did likewise in August. Moody’s Investors Service grades
it four steps below the top.  California had about $103 billion of gross tax-supported
debt in 2012, ranking it first among U.S. states, according to
Moody’s. It placed seventh on a debt-per-capita basis.  Tax revenue totaled $25.5 billion from July through October
of this year, or 2.4 percent above projections, state Controller
John Chiang said in a Nov. 8  update . The stronger-than-expected
revenues demonstrate that “the Great Recession is becoming a
faint image in the rear view mirror,” Chiang said in the
statement on his website.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
