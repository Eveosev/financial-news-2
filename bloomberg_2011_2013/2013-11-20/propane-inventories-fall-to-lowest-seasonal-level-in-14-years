Supplies of propane and propylene in
the U.S. fell to the lowest level for mid-November since 1999 as
domestic demand grows with exports at record levels.  Inventories dropped 2.44 million barrels to 58.4 million in
the week ended Nov. 15, according to Energy Information
Administration data. Exports have averaged 258,000 barrels a day
this year, up from 171,000 in 2012. Propane can be used to dry
crops during fall harvest and heat homes in the winter.  “What we have here is a really strong set of fundamentals
for propane,” said Peter Fasullo, a principal at EnVantage
Inc., an energy consulting firm in Houston. “We’ve had a really
good crop-drying season, we have an early cold surge and we have
strong exports. Add all that together, and it’s presenting us
with a much tighter propane market than we’ve seen in a long
time.”  Propane in Mont Belvieu,  Texas , the largest storage hub in
the U.S., rose 0.12 cent yesterday to $1.1875 a gallon,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price in Conway,
 Kansas , fell 0.5 cent to $1.205.  Crop Drying  Propane  production  declined by 2,000 barrels a day to 1.442
million. Output reached a record level of 1.487 million during
the week of Nov. 1.  Supplies fell the most on the Gulf Coast, where most of the
U.S. export capacity is located. Stocks dropped by 1.82 million
barrels to 31.3 million and dropped below the 10-year seasonal
average for the first time this year.  Inventories in the Midwest slipped by 296,000 to 19.5
million barrels, the lowest level for this time of year since
1996. Crop-drying demand in the region has been larger than
normal because of wet conditions and a record corn harvest.  Governors of  Indiana , Iowa, Minnesota,  Montana ,  Nebraska ,
 South Dakota  and  Wisconsin  declared states of emergency in late
October and early November to allow propane tanker drivers to
work longer hours to make extra deliveries.  “Crop-drying demand was at least 400,000 to 500,000
barrels a day over a several-weeks period,” Fasullo said.
“That is winding down, but winter demand is starting to come
in. That’s probably going to replace a lot of the crop-drying
that occurred.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
