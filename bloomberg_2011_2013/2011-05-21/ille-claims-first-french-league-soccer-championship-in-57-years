Lille won its first French soccer
championship in 57 years following a 2-2 tie with Paris Saint-
Germain.  Lille needed just one point from its final two games to win
its third Ligue One title overall and first since 1954. Ludovic
Obraniak and Moussa Sow scored to give Lille a 2-1 lead before
Mathieu Bodmer drew PSG level in the 73rd minute.  Marseille clinched second place with a 2-2 home draw
against Valenciennes. Lyon played a scoreless draw with Caen to
remain in third place, two points ahead of PSG.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
