Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  has “very
limited” exposure to Greek, Portuguese and Irish government
debt, Investir-Le Journal des Finances reported, citing an
 interview  with Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Chifflet.  The French bank has 805 million euros ($1.14 billion) of
Portuguese government debt in its books, 631 million euros of
Greek debt and 77 million euros of Irish debt, Chifflet told
Investir. A 25 percent depreciation of Greek debt would result
in a 150-million euro charge, he told the weekly newspaper.  Outstanding credits at  Emporiki Bank SA (TEMP) , Credit Agricole’s
Greek unit, are 22 billion euros, or 2 percent of the French
bank’s overall credits, Chifflet said, according to Investir.  To contact the reporter on this story:
