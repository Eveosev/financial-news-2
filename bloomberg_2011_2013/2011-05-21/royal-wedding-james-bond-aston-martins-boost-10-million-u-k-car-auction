Two Aston Martin convertibles similar
to the one used by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their
wedding sold last night as buyers competed at a $10 million
auction of classic vehicles.  The DB6 cars, finished in black and platinum and like the
Prince of  Wales ’s blue model that William and Kate used, each
made 232,500 pounds ($377,000) with fees.  While both DB6s fetched hammer prices that were below their
pre-auction estimates of as much as 250,000 pounds, the Bonhams
sale showed continuing demand for the handmade cars. The annual
event was held at the marque’s factory in Newport Pagnell,
Buckinghamshire, U.K.  “At least two billionaires have been buying Aston Martins
aggressively over the last three or four years,” Dietrich Hatlapa, founder of Historic Automobile Group International
(HAGI), a London-based research company, said before the sale.
“The wedding confirmed the car as a British institution.”  The car in which the newlyweds drove from  Buckingham Palace 
on April 29 was a Seychelles-blue DB6 Volante MKII that  Queen Elizabeth  gave Prince Charles for his 21st birthday in 1969. The
Prince had it converted to run on bioethanol fuel. The Bonhams
cars were DB6 Volante Mk. I convertibles, made in 1968.  During the 1980s, Prince Charles commissioned Aston Martin
to make him another sports convertible, a V8 Volante with a more
powerful Vantage engine. A further 24 cars of this type were
made, the model becoming known as the V8 Vantage Volante “ Prince
of Wales .”  Bond Cars  Timothy Dalton drove a V8 Volante “Prince of Wales” in the
1987 Bond film “The Living Daylights.” Yesterday, a factory-made
replica sold for 172,000 pounds, well above the high estimate of
100,000 pounds.  A clone of the DBS that George Lazenby drove in the 1969
film “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” fetched 106,000 pounds,
again beating the high estimate of as much as 70,000 pounds.
Both replica cars were made by  Aston Martin  in 2008.  The top lot was a 1963 Aston Martin DB4 Series V Vantage
4.2-Litre convertible that sold for 507,500 pounds with fees.
Finished in Aegean blue with pale grey leather upholstery, it
had been estimated to fetch between 440,000 pounds to 480,000
pounds.  The auction raised about 6 million pounds with fees,
against a high estimate of 5.3 million pounds, based on hammer
prices. All but two out of the 45 offered Aston Martins found
buyers, said Bonhams.  The equivalent auction last year achieved a total of 4.7
million pounds from the same number of cars, nine of which
failed. The two Royal Wedding lookalike cars and the top lot
sold to U.K. bidders, Bonhams said.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
