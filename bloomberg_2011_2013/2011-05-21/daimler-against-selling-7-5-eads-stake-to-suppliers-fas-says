Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Chief Financial Officer
Bodo Uebber ruled out selling the company’s 7.5 percent stake in
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. to suppliers of the
Airbus parent,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  said.  Uebber, who is also chairman of EADS, said he’s never seen
a company managed by its suppliers and it would lead to too many
conflicting interests, according to the newspaper. The executive
also ruled out EADS buying the shares back from Daimler as the
company’s cash is destined to develop the business, FAS said.  EADS’s success depends on working with the government as it
is an important customer and partner in preliminary financing,
Uebber told FAS in an interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
