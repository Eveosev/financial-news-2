Russian talks with the European Union
over a visa-free regime are progressing, Russian Foreign Affairs
Minister Sergei Lavrov said today after meeting with his German
and Polish counterparts Guido Westerwelle and Radoslaw Sikorski.  Visa negotiations will be the main topic of a summit with
the EU in  Nizhny Novgorod ,  Russia  on June, 9-10, Lavrov said at
a briefing in Kaliningrad, which was translated by the Russian
state TV Vesti-24. “We are moving forward in negotiations,” he
said.  Russia doesn’t see much sense in the EU suctions against
Belarus, Lavrov said separately. He called for Belarus to
respect the human rights of its citizens and said prison
sentences against two former presidential candidates on May 20
were negative “but we don’t think that the sanctions may help
here”, he said.  Russia wants guarantees that the proposed U.S.-led missile
shield in  Europe  won’t target it, and hopes to be able to
negotiate this, Lavrov said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
