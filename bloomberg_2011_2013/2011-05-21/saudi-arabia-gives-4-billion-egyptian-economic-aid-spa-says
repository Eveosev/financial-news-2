Saudi Arabia  will provide $4 billion
to support the economy in  Egypt , the state-run Saudi Press
Agency said today.  The assistance will be granted in “soft loans, deposits
and grants,” it said, citing a statement issued today by
Egyptian Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, who heads the
ruling military council.  Following weeks of widespread street protests, former
Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  ceded interim authority to the
Supreme Council of the Armed Forces on Feb. 11 after three
decades in power.  Since then, Egypt’s economy has suffered from inflation, a
lack of investment, a budget deficit and decline in tourism,
Mohamed ElBaradei, a possible candidate for the Egyptian
presidency, said today. He urged more outside investment in the
country to spur an economic recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
