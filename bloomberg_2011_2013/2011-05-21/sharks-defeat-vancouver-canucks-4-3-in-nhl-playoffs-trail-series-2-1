The  San Jose Sharks  defeated the
Vancouver Canucks 4-3 in their National Hockey League playoff
game.  The Sharks trail the Canucks 2-1 in the best-of-seven
Western Conference finals.  Top-seeded Vancouver is chasing its first Stanley Cup title,
having twice lost in the finals, most recently in 1994. The
Sharks have never reached the NHL championship series in their
19 major league seasons.  Dan Boyle scored the winning goal in the third period last
night after the Sharks took a 3-0 lead in the first period on
two goals by Patrick Marleau and one by Ryane Clowe at HP
Pavilion in San Jose, California.  Alex Burrows, Dan Hamhuis and Kevin Bieksa each scored for
the Canucks in the third period.  The winner of the Vancouver- San Jose  series, which
continues tomorrow on the Sharksâ€™ home ice, will play either the
 Boston Bruins  or Tampa Bay Lightning, who resume their series
tonight with the Bruins holding a 2-1 lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
