UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s units in eastern
 Europe  won’t need capital injections after the parent company
said it will channel funds to its Kazakh bank, said Gianni Franco Papa, the head of the eastern European business.  “Our banks in the region are very well-capitalized,” Papa
said in an interview in the Kazakh capital Astana today.
UniCredit injected capital into AO ATF Bank “to sustain the
growth of the bank” and meet regulatory requirements.  UniCredit, which is  Italy ’s biggest bank and also the
biggest lender in the former Communist part of Europe, paid $2.1
billion for control of the Kazakh lender in 2007. It wrote down
ATF’s value by 362 million euros ($513 million) last year,
following previous writedowns in 2008. UniCredit will inject
around 190 million euros of fresh capital into ATF by buying new
shares, Papa said May 16.  ATF said April 22 it plans to sell 5.01 million new shares
at 8,000 tenge apiece, or 40.1 billion tenge ($276 million) in
total. UniCredit will buy all of them, Papa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
