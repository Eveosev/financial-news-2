Groupe Limagrain Holding, a French
agricultural cooperative that owns  Europe ’s second-largest seed
company, said it completed the purchase of a 77 percent stake in
cake maker  Brossard SA (ALBRO)  and will offer to buy the remainder.  The cooperative bought 4.34 million Brossard shares for
8.29 euros each, or 36 million euros ($51 million) in total,
from investor Guy Schumacher and some of his family members,
Limagrain said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday. The deal
values all of Brossard at 46.7 million euros.  Chappes, France-based Limagrain said its baked-goods unit
Jacquet SA will file an offer with French regulator Autorite de
Marches Financiers “as soon as possible” to buy the remaining
shares. Brossard shares rose 0.1 percent to 8.20 euros in Paris
yesterday, for a market valuation of 46.2 million euros.  Brossard makes cakes and pastry under the Savane and
Brownie brands, as well as Winnie the Pooh-branded cake under
license from Walt Disney Co., according to the company’s
website. Founded in 1931, pastry maker Georges Brossard sold the
company to Pillsbury in 1968, and subsequent owners were Grand
Metropolitan Plc, Sara Lee Corp. and Saveurs de  France .  Limagrain owns  Vilmorin & Cie. (RIN) , the world’s fourth-largest
seed company and Europe’s second-largest after Syngenta AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
