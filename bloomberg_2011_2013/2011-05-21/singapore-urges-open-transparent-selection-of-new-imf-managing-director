Singapore urged an open and
transparent process to select a new head of the  International
Monetary Fund  after former chief  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  resigned
following his arrest in  New York  on sexual-assault charges.  “It is imperative that the process be open, transparent
and merit-based, so as to ensure the selection of a highly
capable candidate, with the qualities needed to engage with a
broad group of stake-holders internationally and sustain the
Fund’s effective role in global economic management,” Singapore
Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said in a statement e-
mailed today.  The IMF’s 24-person board said it will aim to pick a
successor to Strauss-Kahn by the end of June, and promised to
choose the most-qualified candidate from among front-runners
announced by the agency.  While Chinese officials haven’t publicly endorsed any
candidate, Thailand and the  Philippines  have backed
Shanmugaratnam as a candidate. Former Brazilian central banker
Arminio Fraga, South Africa’s Trevor Manuel, India’s Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Shanmugaratnam would all make “fine
candidates” to lead the IMF, Raghuram Rajan, a professor at the
University of Chicago and a former chief IMF economist, wrote in
the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
