Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the world’s largest
supplier of supplemental health insurance, has agreed to
sponsor the Heisman Trophy, given to college football’s best
player.  Aflac, which didn’t give details of the multiyear
partnership, said its sponsorship will begin this season in the
77th year of the award.  “We know our accounts, agents and brokers are passionate
about the game, so we are excited and honored to team up with
this coveted award which recognizes the most outstanding
college football player in the U.S. and represents the pursuit
of excellence,” said Michael Zuna, senior vice president and
chief marketing officer, in a statement.  The partnership allows the Columbus, Georgia-based company
to offer exclusive, Heisman-themed experiences to its accounts
and brokers, Aflac said.  John Heisman played college football at the  University of
Pennsylvania , and later coached the game at schools including
 Auburn University ,  Rice University  and the Georgia Institute of
Technology until the late 1920s.  Aflac fell 79 cents to $49.57 a share in New York trading
yesterday. The stock is down 12 percent year to date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
