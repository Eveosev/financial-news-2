Jordan holds the 11th-biggest uranium
deposits and is seeking foreign investments in energy projects
including nuclear power,  King Abdullah  said today.  “Recent discoveries in Jordan have revealed the 11th-
largest uranium deposits in the world,” the King told a
conference to encourage Jordanian-U.S. business partnerships in
Amman. “The time is now to discuss wind, solar, and nuclear
power in Jordan’s future,” he said.  Jordan, which imports almost all of its energy needs, has
plans to attract $14 billion in energy infrastructure
investments into renewable energy and oil shale as well as
nuclear power. The kingdom has signed cooperation accords with a
dozen countries to prepare for the construction of at least one
nuclear reactor.  The Jordanian government estimates it has 70,000 tons of
uranium deposits. The country is scheduled to sign an agreement
next month with Australia’s  Alliance Resources Ltd. (AGS)  and
 Gippsland Ltd. (GIP)  to explore for uranium in the southern parts of
the kingdom, the Jordan Energy Resources Inc. said May 17.  “Energy security and environmental safety are strong
priorities,” King Abdullah said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
