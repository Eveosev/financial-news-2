Luigi Del Neri said he’ll be replaced
as Juventus coach after tomorrow’s season-ending game against
Napoli.  Juventus is seventh in Italian soccer’s Serie A, three
points behind Roma, and will likely miss out on European
competition next season.  “Juventus will change their manager, they’ve informed me
of their decision,” Del Neri said on the club’s website. “The
right decision? It’s not up for me to respond to that, but I
don’t feel the scapegoat. I work for a club and they are free to
make a change if they wish to do so.”  Del Neri took over Juventus on May 19, 2010, two days after
he quit as coach at Sampdoria. He’s also managed Roma, Palermo
and Chievo during his career.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
