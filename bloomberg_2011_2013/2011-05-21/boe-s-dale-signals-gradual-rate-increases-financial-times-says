 Spencer Dale  signaled that  interest rates  in the nation may rise
gradually over the next two years, the Financial Times reported
yesterday, citing an interview.  When the U.K. reported inflation data this month, markets
were betting on an increase in the benchmark rate to 0.75
percent from 0.5 percent by December, followed by 1 percentage
point of rises a year over the next two years, the newspaper
cited Dale as saying. At the time the report was released, that
broad path “didn’t look wholly improbably,” Dale said,
according to a report posted on the FT web site yesterday.  “I’m not at all confident that the recovery has taken hold
and will definitely power away,” Dale said, according to the
report. “However, I’m even more worried about what’s going on
in terms of inflation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
