Real Madrid’s  Cristiano Ronaldo 
scored twice in an 8-1 rout of Almeria to break the record for
goals in a season in  Spain ’s Primera Division.  Ronaldo finished with 40 league goals, eclipsing the record
of 38 he shared with Athletic Bilbao’s Telmo Zarra, from the
1950-51 season, and Madrid’s Hugh Sanchez, from the 1989-90
campaign. He broke the mark from close range after just four
minutes at the Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid and added his second
goal with 13 minutes remaining.  Ronaldo scored 11 goals in his final four league matches
and had 53 in all competitions this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
