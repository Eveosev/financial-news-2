German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that the year 2022, specified by her Christian Social Union
Bavarian allies for a nuclear exit, is the “correct time
frame,”  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  reported.  The chancellor, speaking today at a meeting with the CSU,
said she wants to wait for the results of an ethics commission
report before commenting further on the country’s exit from
atomic energy, DPA said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
