Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest
crude exporter, increased its daily oil output by 7.3 percent
year-on-year in the first quarter to replace a fall in output
from other OPEC member countries, Al Rajhi Capital said in a
report.  The investment arm of  Saudi Arabia ’s largest lender by
market value said today that it expects the price of West Texas
Intermediate crude to average $93 a barrel this year, up by $6
from its previous estimate, as prices have advanced globally
since February.  Based on current average prices of WTI and Saudi’s Arab
Light crude, the investment bank said that it expects the
country’s oil sector to grow by 6.6 percent on average in 2011.
Non-oil private industries, which include petrochemicals
producers, will grow by 5.5 percent, it said.  Saudi Arabia pumped 8.66 million barrels of oil a day on
average in March, down 4 percent from its output of 9.02 million
a day in the previous month, government data posted on the Joint
Organization Data Initiative website on May 18 showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
