Billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , who
may run for Russian president next year, told state television
he will focus his politics on helping to develop small business,
news agency RIA Novosti reported today.  Russia’s third-richest man with a fortune that Forbes puts
at $18 billion, will pursue the chairmanship of Pravoye Delo, or
Right Cause party, and will announce whether he intends to run
for president at its annual meeting scheduled for June 25, he
said May 16.  Right Cause, with 65,000 members, will compete in December
parliamentary elections against Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s
 United Russia , which holds 315 of 450 seats in the State Duma
and has about 2 million members.  Prokhorov said he may head the list of Right Cause
candidates in December to become a lawmaker in the State Duma
and would seek to be the sole chairman of the party, which now
has three people in that capacity, RIA Novosti reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
