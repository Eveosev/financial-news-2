Leinster rallied in the second half
to defeat Northampton 33-22 in the final of rugby’s Heineken
Cup.  Leinster came back from a 22-6 halftime deficit at the
Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to win  Europe ’s elite club
competition for the second time. The Dublin-based club also
captured the title in 2009.  Jonathan Sexton scored 28 points -- with two tries, four
penalties and two conversions -- to lead the rally. Nathan Hines
also scored a try for Leinster.  Phil Dowson, Ben Foden and Dyland Hartley touched down for
Northampton, which lost for the first time in nine Heineken Cup
games this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
