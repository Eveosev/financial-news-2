The  California Air Resources Board 
will appeal a court ruling that suspends work on a cap-and-trade
program to cut  greenhouse gases , the agency said.  The notice of appeal will be filed May 23, Stanley Young, a
spokesman for the agency, said in an e-mail today.  Superior Court Judge Ernest Goldsmith in San Francisco
today ordered the board to halt further rulemaking or
implementation of the program until alternatives are properly
reviewed.  The board violated the “informational requirements” of
the California Environmental Quality Act when it began to make
rules “without first responding to comments, completing the
environmental review process, and approving” the program,
Goldsmith said in the ruling.  The decision is the latest development in a 2009 lawsuit
filed against the board by a coalition that includes Communities
for a Better Environment and the Association of Irritated
Residents. Today’s judgment follows a March 18 ruling in which
the court also said the board failed to adequately consider
alternatives to the program to buy and sell pollution permits,
such as a carbon tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
