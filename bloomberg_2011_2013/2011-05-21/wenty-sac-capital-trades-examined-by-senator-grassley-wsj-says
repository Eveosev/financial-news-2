U.S. Senator  Charles Grassley  is
examining about 20 potential instances of possible  insider
trading  at SAC Capital Advisors LP, his spokeswoman said.  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority sent Grassley,
the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, “about 20
suspicious instances of trading by SAC Capital,” Jill Gerber,
the spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today. Gerber provided no
further details.  The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.
Jonathan Gasthalter, an outside spokesman for SAC Capital at New
York-based public relations firm Sard Verbinnen & Co., had no
immediate comment on the report.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the Grassley
investigation of the firm. The Journal said authorities haven’t
alleged any wrongdoing by SAC Capital or its founder,  Steven A. Cohen .  To contact the reporters on this story:
