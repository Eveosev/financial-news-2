Shackleford outran Kentucky Derby
winner  Animal Kingdom  to claim the  136th Preakness Stakes  and
ensure that thoroughbred racing will have to wait at least
another year for a 12th Triple Crown winner.  Shackleford led from start to finish to complete the 1
3/16th-mile race at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore yesterday
in one minute, 56.21 seconds. Kentucky Derby champion Animal
Kingdom was a half-length further back, followed by Astrology
in third place.  Shackleford, a 3-year-old colt, was already sweating as he
kicked out on the infield while waiting to get the saddle on,
before acting up as he was loaded in the fifth gate.  “He gets a little hot,” his trainer Dale Romans said in
a televised interview after the race. “I was more concerned at
the quarter pole that he would hold on.”  It’s the first Preakness win for jockey Jesus Castanon and
Romans, who trained runner-up First Dude and sixth-place
finisher  Paddy O’Prado  in last year’s race.  “He was a little hot in the beginning,” said Castanon,
who rode Shackleford to fourth place in the Derby. “But he was
able to handle it.”  Shackleford won the first-place purse of $600,000 plus a
$500,000 bonus. The winner paid $27.20 to win, $10.20 to place
and $6.80 to show on a $2 bet. Animal Kingdom, the 5-2
favorite, returned $4.20 and $3.60, and Astrology paid $8.  Crowded Out  Animal Kingdom, hanging in the back of the 14-horse pack,
got caught in a crowd after making his move, which forced the
3-year-old colt to the outside in the stretch.  “He ran huge,” said trainer Graham Motion, who opted to
take Animal Kingdom to Baltimore yesterday morning from his
home stall 60 miles away (97 kilometers). “He needed another
1/16.”  Jockey John Velazquez said Animal Kingdom seemed to be
bothered by the dirt kicked up by the other horses. The colt
ran his first race on a dirt track in the Derby at Churchill
Downs in Louisville,  Kentucky , on May 7.  “He reacted to the dirt,” Velazquez said. “He kind of
backed up.”  Animal Kingdom’s defeat leaves Affirmed in 1978 as the
last of the 11 winners of the Triple Crown, which concludes
with the Belmont Stakes on June 11 in Elmont,  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
