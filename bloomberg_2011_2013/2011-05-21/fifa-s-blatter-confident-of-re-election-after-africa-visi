FIFA President  Sepp Blatter  said he
is confident of being re-elected head of soccer’s governing body
next month after his campaign was bolstered by the support of
African soccer groups gathered this weekend in Johannesburg.  “I’m confident, very confident, especially after having
received the support of the associations assembled here,” he
told reporters today.  Blatter, 75, is running for a fourth term in the June 1
vote, and is being opposed by Mohamed Bin Hammam, the Qatari who
heads the Asian soccer federation. FIFA will hear evidence from
a former employee of Qatar’s successful bid for the 2022  World
Cup  that the country paid bribes to two officials to secure the
event, Blatter said on May 19.  African football groups with members including, among
others,  South Africa , Angola, Kenya, Ghana and Gabon “declare
our full support for the re-election of Mr. Blatter,” Mahomed
Iya, President of Unifac, a Central African football body, said
in a speech. Blatter has already received the endorsements of
the governing bodies in  Europe , South America and the Oceania
region.  Blatter told reporters he will propose that a woman be
added to FIFA’s 24-member executive committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
