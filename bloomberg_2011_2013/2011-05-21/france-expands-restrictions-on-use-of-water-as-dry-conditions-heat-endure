French authorities widened water-use
restrictions to 42 of  France ’s 96 mainland departments as
drought conditions persisted in the country, the European
Union’s largest agricultural producer.  The number of departments in France with limits and bans
on water use as of yesterday had increased from 28 on May 16,
according to a  statement  by the Environmental Ministry published
on its website today.  Soils in France’s northern half, where grains, grapes and
rapeseed are grown, were the driest in 50 years at the end of
April, the  Environment Ministry  reported this week. The
quantity of water stored as mountain snow was “very inferior”
to the average from 1995 to 2005 as of May 1, it said.  Meteo France  forecasts  temperatures higher than 20 degrees
Celsius (68 Fahrenheit) for most of France in the coming three
days, with some “scattered rain” tomorrow. Temperatures may
rise above 30 degrees by the middle of next week with no rain,
before the possibility of some slight rain by the end of the
week, according to the forecaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
