The U.K., which has had less rain
than usual in the past  two months , must work to safeguard its
long-term water supply, the  Daily Mail  said, citing Environment
Minister Lord Henley.  Water companies need to find ways of storing more water
during wetter months and prevent pumping stations from flooding,
the report said. The current dry spell is a “taste of things to
come,” the minister was cited as saying by the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
