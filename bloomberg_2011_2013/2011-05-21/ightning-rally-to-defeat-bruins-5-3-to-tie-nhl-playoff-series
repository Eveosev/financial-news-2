The  Tampa Bay  Lightning came from
behind to beat the Boston Bruins 5-3 and tie their National
Hockey League playoff series at two games apiece.  Tampa Bay trailed 3-0 after one period before tying the
game in the second period on two goals from Teddy Purcell and
one from Sean Bergenheim.  Simon Gagne  gave the Lightning the
lead early in the third period and Martin St. Louis capped the
comeback with an empty-net goal in the final minute.  Patrice Bergeron scored two goals and Michael Ryder added
one for Boston, which hosts Game 5 of the best-of-seven Eastern
Conference final series in two days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
