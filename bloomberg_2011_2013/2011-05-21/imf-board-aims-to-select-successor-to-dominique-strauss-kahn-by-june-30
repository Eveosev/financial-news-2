The  International Monetary Fund  said
it aims to complete the selection of a successor to  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  by June 30.  Countries will be able to nominate candidates for the
managing director’s position between May 23 and June 10,
the Washington-based IMF said in a statement today. The board
will meet with all candidates if there are fewer than four and
with a short list if there are more.  The procedure “allows the selection of the next managing
director to take place in an open, merit-based, and transparent
manner,” said Shakour Shaalan, the senior member of the 24-
person board.  The IMF said the board’s objective is to select the
managing director by consensus.  French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  emerged as the
leading contender to replace Strauss-Kahn, who was indicted
yesterday on charges including attempted rape, as European
officials moved to maintain control over the institution.  Officials in emerging markets including Thailand, Russia
and  South Africa  said the next IMF managing director should come
from a developing nation even as they failed to unite behind one
candidate the way Europe coalesced around Lagarde.  To contact the reporter on this story:
