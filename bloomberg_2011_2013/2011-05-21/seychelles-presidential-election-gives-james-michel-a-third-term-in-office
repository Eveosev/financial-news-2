James Michel won his third term as
president of the Seychelles, securing 55.46 percent of the vote
yesterday against 41.43 percent for Wavel Ramkalawan, his main
opponent.  Both Michel’s Parti Lepep and Ramkalawan’s Seychelles
National Party accused the other of bribing voters on the Indian
Ocean archipelago.  About 58,000 eligible voters cast their ballot over a
three-day period, out of some 69,000 registered voters. Voting
was extended to allow people on outlying islands the chance to
participate.  Michel has been in office since 2004 after replacing the
People’s Party socialist leader France Albert Rene, who came to
power in a coup in 1977. Michel was re-elected in 2006 with 53.7
percent of the vote against the 45.7 percent won by Ramkalawan.  The Seychelles economy depends mainly on tourism for
revenue, which is supplemented by fishing. The islands are well-
known by Europeans as a tourist destination. Britain’s  Prince
William  and his wife Kate ended their honeymoon in the tropical
destination this week.  Michel instituted economic changes in 2008 and the economy
will likely grow about 4 percent this year, the  International
Monetary Fund  said in March.  The inflation rate peaked at 63.3 percent in December 2008
after the Indian Ocean islands floated the rupee, with prices
starting to decline in December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
