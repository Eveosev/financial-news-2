OJSC Belpromstroybank, controlled by
Russian lender OAO Sberbank, has received a $50 million, five
year loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development to boost its lending, the EBRD said.  Belpromstroybank plans “to triple the EBRD’s commitment by
earmarking an additional $100 million of its own funds for this
lending program, which is targeted at micro, small and medium-
sized enterprises”, the EBRD said today in e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
