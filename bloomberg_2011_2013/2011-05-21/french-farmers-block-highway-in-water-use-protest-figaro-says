French farmers blocked exits on the
main highway linking Paris and Bordeaux in the southwest of the
country today to protest local government bans on water use, Le
Figaro reported.  Livestock breeders and grain growers blocked exit and
access ramps at four points along a 70 kilometer-long (43.5
miles) stretch of the A10 highway north of Bordeaux this
morning, causing traffic jams on the road toward La Rochelle on
the Atlantic Coast, the newspaper said.  The farmers blocked cars from entering or exiting the
highway from 7 a.m., saying that since there’s no water for
farmers, there’s none for tourists either, Le Figaro said.  Crops are three weeks ahead of normal development because
of drought and heat, and corn needs water now, according to
Daniel Seguin, the head of a local association that seeks more
consultation between farmers and local government on irrigation
and water management, Le Figaro reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
