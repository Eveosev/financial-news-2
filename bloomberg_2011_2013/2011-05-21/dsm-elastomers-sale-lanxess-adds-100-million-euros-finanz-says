Dutch chemicals maker Royal DSM NV
will show a book profit of 100 million euros ($142 million) in
the second quarter following the sale of its Elastomers unit to
 Lanxess AG (LXS) , Chief Financial Officer Rolf-Dieter Schwalb was
cited as saying in an interview with  Finanz und Wirtschaft .  In the euro crisis, the expensive Swiss franc is “the most
critical for us,” the Zurich-based paper also quoted Schwalb as
saying. The strong franc “is costing us a lot of money.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
