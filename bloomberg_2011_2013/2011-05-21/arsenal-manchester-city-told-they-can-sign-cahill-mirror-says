Arsenal and Manchester City have been
told they can sign Bolton defender  Gary Cahill  for 17 million
pounds ($27.5 million) this summer, the Daily Mirror said.  The high price could leave City as the favorite as Arsenal
manager  Arsene Wenger  has said he won’t overpay for English
players, the Mirror said. Cahill has one year left on his
contract.  Arsenal and City are also interested in Blackburn’s Phil
Jones, while Wenger inquired about his teammate Chris Samba in
January, the Mirror said. Wenger is also tracking Paris Saint
German’s Mamadou Sakho and Lorient’s Bruno Ecuele Manga, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
