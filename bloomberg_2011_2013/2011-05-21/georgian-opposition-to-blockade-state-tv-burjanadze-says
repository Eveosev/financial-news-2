Georgian opposition groups, which are
staging a series of rallies in Tbilisi today, plan to blockade
the state television headquarters in the capital, opposition
leader Nino Burjanadze told an assembled crowd.  The protesters are seeking to depose President Mikheil
Saakashvili, a one-time ally who Burjanadze accuses of
manipulating elections. The opposition last staged a major rally
in 2009.  Saakashvili, 43, swept to power in the so-called Rose
Revolution in 2003. He has been under pressure since 2007, when
protests turned violent as opponents accused him of political
persecution and failing to raise  living standards .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
