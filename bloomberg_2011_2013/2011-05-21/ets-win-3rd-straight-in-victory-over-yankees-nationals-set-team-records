Daniel Murphy hit his fourth home run
of the season to lift the  New York Mets  to a 2-1 victory over
cross-town rival  New York Yankees  in an interleague Major League
Baseball game.  Justin Turner hit a run-scoring double in the fourth
inning, followed by Murphy’s home run to give the Mets (22-22)
their third straight win and 10th victory in the last 14 games.  R.A. Dickey unleashed his knuckleball on the Yankees and
struck out six on the way to his second win this season.  “Whenever you face a knuckleballer, you’re really not sure
what’s going to happen, because it’s not something guys face
every day,” Yankee manager  Joe Girardi  told reporters. “We had
some opportunities, but it’s a totally different day for all of
our hitters.”  Mark Teixeira  homered in the third, his 11th of the season,
to give the Yankees a 1-0 lead at Yankee Stadium.  The Yankees (23-20) lost their sixth straight home game for
the longest losing streak at Yankee Stadium since an eight-game
stretch from May 16-26 in 2003.  Dickey (2-5) went six innings, giving up four hits and one
run.  Francisco Rodriguez  got his 15th save after pitching a
perfect inning with two strikeouts.  Yankee pitcher  Freddy Garcia  (2-4) surrendered five hits
and two runs in seven innings.  Record-Setting Game  In Baltimore, the Nationals (21-23) set a record with six
home runs in a single game as they defeated the Orioles (19-24)
17-5 at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.  Danny Espinosa homered and drove in five runs,  Jayson Werth 
add two home runs and four runs batted in, and Roger Bernadina,
Wilson Ramos and Laynce Nix contributed a homer each for the
Nationals, who tallied a season-high 19 hits.  “We’ve played good baseball. We just haven’t really had
too many offensive nights,” Nationals manager Jim Riggleman
said. “So hopefully this will be the start of something.”  Henry Rodriguez (1-0) worked three scoreless innings for
the victory. Jake Arrieta (5-2) gave up six hits and six runs in
3 2/3 innings.  “They swung the bats well. Got into some deep counts,
though, and gave them some hittable pitches,” Arrieta said.
“They still got to put good swings on the ball in order to
score that many runs. It’s not a great feeling.”  In the National League, it was Milwaukee 7, Colorado 6 (14
innings).  In interleague games at National League Stadiums, it was
Philadelphia 3, Texas 2; Pittsburgh 10, Detroit 1; Florida 5,
Tampa Bay 3; Seattle 4, San Diego 1; Arizona 8, Minnesota 7; and
San Francisco 2, Oakland 1 (10 innings).  In interleague games at American League Stadiums, it was
Cleveland 5, Cincinnati 4; Houston 5, Toronto 2; Kansas City 3,
St. Louis 0; Boston 15, the Chicago Cubs 5; the Los Angeles
Dodgers 6, the Chicago White Sox 4 (10 innings); and the Los
Angeles Angels 9, Atlanta 0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
