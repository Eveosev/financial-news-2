New York Mets Hall of Fame catcher
Gary Carter has been diagnosed with four small tumors on his
brain, the New York Daily News reported on its website.  Carter, 57, will be going to Duke University Hospital in
 North Carolina  for surgery in the next few days, the Daily News
said, citing unidentified people close to Carter. It won’t be
known until the surgery whether the tumors are benign or
malignant, the newspaper said.  Carter, who also played for the Montreal Expos, San
Francisco Giants and  Los Angeles Dodgers , has spent the past two
seasons as baseball coach at Palm Beach Atlantic College in
Florida. A call to the school’s sports information office by
Bloomberg News went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
