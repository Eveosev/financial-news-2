Only four of  Germany ’s 17 nuclear
plants are in operation after some reactors were shut down for
maintenance,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said, citing the country’s
Federal Network Agency.  Germany’s seven oldest reactors were shut down after the
March 11 disaster at  Japan ’s nuclear plant at Fukushima and five
more have been halted for planned maintenance, the newspaper
said. Another hasn’t been in operation for years.  Power generated from nuclear energy in Germany has fallen
to under 10 percent, about half of what is produced from sun,
wind and hydro, from 23 percent of the total before March, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
