German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said Europe should nominate his French counterpart
 Christine Lagarde  as head of the International Monetary Fund,
 Bild am Sonntag  reported, citing an interview with Schaeuble.  A Lagarde candidacy would give Europe the best chance of
filling the post and the region should “speak with one voice”
on the issue, the German finance minister said, according to the
newspaper.  Schaeuble said that a European should get the job and that
a decision should be made within the next weeks, Bild reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
