Mexico ’s government is considering
nominating its central bank governor, Agustin Carstens, to
succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn as head of the International
Monetary Fund, Reuters reported today, citing a person it didn’t
name.  The  report  didn’t elaborate on the timing of such a
decision. Erika Contreras, a spokeswoman for Mexico’s finance
ministry, didn’t immediately return a phone message from
Bloomberg News. Carstens was a deputy managing director at the
Washington-based IMF from 2003 to 2006.  The IMF said yesterday it aims to complete by June 30 the
selection of a successor to Strauss-Kahn who was indicted May 19
in  New York  on charges including attempted rape. Carstens, who
took the reins of Mexico’s central bank in January 2010 after
being the country’s finance minister, has a doctorate in
economics from the  University of Chicago .  Mexico leads a group of eight countries with 117,045 votes,
or  4.66 percent  of the total IMF voting power, according to the
multilateral lender’s website. The group is the seventh largest,
measured by voting power, behind the U.S., Japan, Germany,
France, the U.K. and 10 nations led by Belgium.  “The best candidate to direct the Fund is Agustin
Carstens,” Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  told reporters
yesterday in Mexico City, specifying that he was expressing his
personal opinion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
