Bilfinger Berger SE (GBF)  plans to spend
about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) on big and small
acquisitions over the next two years,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung  reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Herbert Bodner.  Bilfinger is seeking partners for its building-management
unit in France, Belgium or Luxembourg and for its industrial
factory service operations in the Middle East, Turkey and  India ,
the newspaper quoted Bodner as saying. Most of the money comes
from the sale of the German companyâ€™s Australian unit, FAS said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
