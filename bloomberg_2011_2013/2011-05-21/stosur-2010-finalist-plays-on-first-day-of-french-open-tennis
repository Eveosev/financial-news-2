Samantha Stosur will be the highest
-ranked woman in action tomorrow at the  French Open  as the eighth
-seeded Australian, last year’s runner-up, meets Iveta Benesova as
the season's second Grand Slam tennis tournament opens in Paris.  Stosur has beaten the 53rd-ranked Czech player the three 
times they've faced off, including on clay courts in Rome earlier
this year. That's the same surface at  Roland Garros .  Former top-ranked player Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, the No.
10 seed, plays Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine, and 2009 champion
Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia, the 13th seed, faces Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia in other women’s matches.  No. 7 David Ferrer of Spain takes on Finland’s Jarkko Nieminen in the men’s draw. France’s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the 17th
seed, plays Jan Hajek of the Czech Republic and former Wimbledon
champion Lleyton Hewitt of Australia takes on Spaniard Albert Montanes.  Both champions begin their title defences against players
from the U.S.  Spain ’s  Rafael Nadal , who is seeking to equal Bjorn Borg’s
Open-era record of six French titles, plays John Isner and
Francesca Schiavone of Italy takes on Melanie Oudin. Those
matches will be played May 23 or 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
