Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  had emissions at
its St. Charles refinery in Norco, Louisiana, after an equipment
failure, according to a filing with the National Response
Center.  U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldnâ€™t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  The refinery, 25 miles west of  New Orleans , can process
250,000 barrels of crude oil daily, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
