Celtic defeated Motherwell 3-0 to win
the Scottish Cup for a record-extending 35th time.  Ki Sung-Yeung gave Celtic the lead in the 32nd minute at
rainy Hampden Park in Glasgow. Stephen Craiganâ€™s own goal in the
second half made it 2-0 and Charlie Mulgrew closed the scoring
with a free kick in the 88th minute.  Celtic, which lost the league title to rival Rangers by one
point, last won the Scottish Cup in 2007. Motherwell was seeking
its first title since 1991.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
