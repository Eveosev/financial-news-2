France ’s Foreign Trade Minister
Pierre Lellouche is visiting Qatar today and tomorrow to promote
French industry as the Middle Eastern country prepares to host
the soccer  World Cup  in 2022.  Lellouche is being accompanied by representatives from
about 30 companies including Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the vice-
chairman of construction company Vinci AG and vice-president of
employers’ organization Medef International, France’s economy
ministry said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Qatar plans to invest $100 billion to prepare for the 2022
soccer event as well as the handball World Cup in 2015, the
ministry said. Lellouche will be visiting the site of the new
city of Lusail, which will be home to a new stadium, it said.  “Lellouche will share with the Qatari authorities France’s
willingness to be at the forefront of implementing the
investment plan,” the ministry said. The goal is “for French
companies, including small- and medium-sized enterprises, to
make the most of the tremendous growth opportunities,” it said.  Qatar’s gross domestic product is expected to grow by 20
percent in 2011, the economy ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
