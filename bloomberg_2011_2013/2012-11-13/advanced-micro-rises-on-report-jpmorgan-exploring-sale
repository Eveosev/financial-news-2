Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) , the
second-largest maker of processors for personal computers, rose
the most in two months after Reuters reported that the company
hired  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to explore options including a sale.  The  shares  advanced 5 percent to $2.09 at the close in New
York. Earlier, they surged as much as 18 percent to $2.35 for
the biggest intraday gain since July 2011. AMD pared its decline
for the year to 61 percent.  AMD is considering a sale, as well as options for its
patent portfolio, Reuters said, citing sources familiar with the
situation.  Drew Prairie , a spokesman for the company, wasn’t
immediately available for comment. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman
for JPMorgan, declined to comment.  Last month, AMD forecast fourth-quarter sales that fell
short of analysts’s estimates and said it would cut 15 percent
of its staff, citing weak demand across all product lines in a
challenging economic environment. AMD joined other makers of
computer components suffering fallout from sluggish growth and a
shift in consumer tastes toward mobile devices, away from
traditional desktop and laptop machines. The forecast revision
followed the resignation, announced in September, of Chief
Financial Officer Thomas Seifert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
