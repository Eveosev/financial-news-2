(Corrects date of low in fifth paragraph.)  Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index headed for the lowest close in four weeks, as
property companies and energy shares declined.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd., which develops real estate
projects in China, dropped 2.5 percent on concern that the
mainland may increase property curbs.  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (386) , the state-backed Chinese refiner, fell 2.6 percent as oil
declined for a second day.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China
Ltd.  led banks lower.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.9 percent to 21,238.27 as of the
midday trading break in Hong Kong, with all but five stocks
dropping, headed for the lowest close since Oct. 16. Trading
volume about equal with the 30-day average for the time of day.
The benchmark gauge advanced 18 percent from a June 4 low
through yesterday as economic data showed China’s slowdown may
be bottoming out and central banks around the globe added
stimulus to spur growth.  “Hong Kong has shot up too much and it has a chance to
have a significant correction,” said Linus Yip, chief
strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong. “Data are
in line with market forecasts, but I don’t think just one
month’s worth is strong enough to convince the market that China
has resumed growth.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
slipped 1.7 percent to 10,271.44, dropping for a fourth day and
extending a decline from a five-month high struck on Nov. 2. The
measure entered a so-called  bull market  on Nov. 2 after
advancing 20 percent from its low for the year on Sept. 5.  The Hang Seng Index  traded  at 11.2 times estimated earnings
as of yesterday, compared with 13.3 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Property Curbs  Chinese developers slid after China will “steadfastly”
enforce property controls, the nation’s housing ministry said in
a statement. Shimao, which had risen 121 percent this year
through yesterday, fell 2.5 percent to HK$14.28, and  Agile
Property Holdings Ltd. (3383)  lost 2.7 percent to HK$9.26.  Energy shares dropped after crude for December delivery
slid as much as 50 cents to $85.07 a barrel in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . China Petroleum &
Chemical, known as Sinopec, dropped 2.6 percent to HK$7.89.
 PetroChina Co. (857) , the nation’s biggest oil and natural gas
producer, fell 1.4 percent to HK$10.20.  Chinese banks declined.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China  slid 1.6 percent to HK$4.97.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) 
dropped 1.2 percent to HK$5.69.  China’s money supply gained 14.1 percent in October,
missing a median forecast of 14.5 percent, the Beijing-based
People’s Bank of China reported yesterday. Also, the nation’s
new  yuan  loans unexpectedly dropped last month from a year
earlier.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  lost 0.5 percent today after
the U.S. benchmark was little changed yesterday as investors
awaited U.S. budget talks. Euro-area finance ministers gave
Greece two extra years to cut its  budget deficit , pledging to
prevent the region’s debt crisis from escalating.  The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  dropped 0.9 percent to 17.12,
indicating traders expect a 4.9 percent swing in the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days. Futures on the Hang Seng Index
fell 0.9 percent to 21,222.  Of the 49 companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index that
have reported quarterly earnings since Oct. 1 and for which
estimates are available, 57 percent missed expectations,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
