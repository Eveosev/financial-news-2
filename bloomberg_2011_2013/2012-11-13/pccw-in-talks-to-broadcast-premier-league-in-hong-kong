PCCW Ltd. (8) , which controls Hong
Kong’s biggest telecommunications operator, entered final talks
for local broadcast rights for the U.K.’s Barclays Premier
League soccer, taking over from  I-Cable Communications Ltd. (1097)   PCCW Media is seeking to complete an agreement soon that
will allow it to show 380 league games for three seasons
starting in 2013-2014 over its Now TV service and platforms
including the Internet, the company said in a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing yesterday.  The contract costs PCCW less than $200 million, the
Standard newspaper reported, citing an unidentified person.
The win would return the broadcast rights to PCCW, which had
lost them to I-Cable for three seasons starting in 2010.  PCCW didn’t disclose financial details of the proposed deal
in the statement. I-Cable didn’t reveal financial details of its
earlier agreement as well.  To contact the reporters on this story:
