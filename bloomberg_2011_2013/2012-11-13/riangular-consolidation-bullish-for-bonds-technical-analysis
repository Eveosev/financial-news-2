A so-called triangular consolidation
trading pattern on 10-year Treasury note futures suggests a
bullish breakout for the contract that would equal the high
reached in July, according to Bank of America Corp.  “While bearish momentum divergences should be a concern
for longer term bulls, the increasingly triangular consolidation
points to a bullish break,”  MacNeil Curry , chief rates and
currencies technical strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch
in  New York , wrote today in a client note.  The December 10-year futures contract touched a high of 134
18/32 on July 25. It climbed today to 134 5/32. The note is
“carving out a four-day symmetrical triangle, which points to a
push” to the higher level, Curry wrote.  “From a 10-year cash perspective, this  targets  the pivotal
1.554 percent - 1.54 percent zone,” Curry wrote, adding “into
here we would be on the lookout for greater signs of stalling.”  A break of  1.667 percent  or a price of 133 11/32 would
confirm a bearish turn in trend, he added.  Curry did not immediately return calls seeking comment.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
