Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K. oil and gas
company in  Africa , received approaches to sell stakes in its
assets as energy explorers step up the search for resources.  “We’ve had a number of discussions about farming in to
acreage, partnerships and joint ventures,” Chief Executive
Officer Osman Shahenshah said today in an interview, refering to
taking stakes. “We have high equity positions in most of our
acreage, and that gives us a lot of options.”  Afren operates in Nigeria and Ivory Coast as well as East
Africa, where it plans to drill exploration wells in Kenya,
 Ethiopia ,  Tanzania  and Madagascar. Shahenshah in March forecast
more oil companies would seek fields in the region following the
first onshore crude discovery in  Kenya .  The CEO said there are no plans to sell London-based Afren.
It  fell  1.8 percent to 137.1 pence by the close in the city.  The company, which also owns fields in the Kurdistan region
of  Iraq , today reported record third-quarter sales of $1.1
billion and said it’s on schedule to produce more than 40,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day this year. Afren will use its
revenue to bring more resources to development, Shahenshah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
