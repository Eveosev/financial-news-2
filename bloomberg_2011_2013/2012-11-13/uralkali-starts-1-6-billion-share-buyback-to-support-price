OAO Uralkali (URKA) , the world’s largest
potash producer, approved a $1.6 billion share buyback program
after the stock fell 14 percent from this year’s high.  The company’s board authorized a one-year share repurchase
plan after a previous buyback ended last month, Uralkali said
today in a regulatory filing.  “The buyback should support the market price of our
stock,” Chief Financial Officer Viktor Belyakov told reporters
late yesterday in Moscow.  Uralkali, controlled by a group of billionaires of which
Suleiman Kerimov is the largest investor, spent about $863
million buying back its stock in the last $2.5 billion one-year
program. The company said at the time it would distribute the
remaining cash in the form of a special dividend or announce a
new buyback.  Uralkali is unlikely to use the whole $1.6 billion of funds
allocated for the buyback, Belyakov said. The company hasn’t
ruled out a special dividend which will depend on the situation
in the potash market, he said.  Once the new program ends, Uralkali plans to cancel the
shares that have been repurchased, Belyakov said.  Uralkali rose 2 percent yesterday to 235.31 rubles after
the company said its board was considering another buyback. The
stock is down 14 percent from July’s closing high for the year.  The company said last week its owners sold bonds
exchangeable into 12.5 percent of the stock to China Investment
Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
