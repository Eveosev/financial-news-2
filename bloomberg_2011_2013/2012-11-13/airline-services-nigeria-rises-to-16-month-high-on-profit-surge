Airline Services and Logistics Plc ,
 Nigeria ’s biggest airline catering company, climbed to the
highest in almost 16 months after saying nine-month profit more
than tripled.  The stock gained 4.8 percent to 2.62 naira by 12:51 in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, the highest level since
July 18, 2011. Almost 423,000 shares traded, more than four
times the three-month daily average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Profit for the nine months through September rose to 455.9
million naira from 143.26 million naira a year earlier, the
Lagos-based company said on Nov. 9. Revenue rose to 2.96 billion
naira from 2.68 billion naira, it said.  The result is “fantastic,” David Adonri, chief executive
officer of Lambeth Trust and Investment Co. Ltd, said by phone
from Lagos today. “The company is minting money and that is
enough to attract investors into it,” he said.  Earnings per share were 72 kobo, the company said. The
company might make year-end EPS of 1 naira, according to Adonri,
“which means that right now, the stock is undervalued,” he
said.  Airline Services shares have risen 21 percent this year,
compared with a 27 percent increase in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
