Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CPIX) , the
maker of emergency medications, settled patent-infringement
litigation with generic-drug makers  Perrigo Co. (PRGO)  and Paddock
Laboratories LLC over Acetadote, an acetaminophen overdose
treatment.  Cumberland, based in Nashville, Tennessee, sued Allegan,
Michigan-based Perrigo and Minneapolis-based Paddock in May in
federal court in  Delaware  to block their plan to market copies
of  Acetadote  before the patent expires in 2026.  Under the settlement, “Paddock and Perrigo admit that the
Acetadote patent is valid and enforceable,” and if another
company introduces a generic copy, Cumberland will supply an
authorized generic to Perrigo, according to a Cumberland filing
yesterday with the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .  Acetadote is used in hospital emergency rooms to limit
liver damage from life-threatening overuse of the pain reliever
acetaminophen -- a leading cause of poisoning in the U.S.,
according to Cumberland.  Another lawsuit, in which Cumberland sued InnoPharma LLC
over the same patent, is pending.  Perrigo fell 1.1 percent to $103.98 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading at 2:17 p.m. in  New York . Cumberland was unchanged at
$4.55. Paddock is closely held.  The case is Cumberland v. Paddock and Perrigo, 12-cv-619,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 8,148,356.  To contact the reporter on this story:
