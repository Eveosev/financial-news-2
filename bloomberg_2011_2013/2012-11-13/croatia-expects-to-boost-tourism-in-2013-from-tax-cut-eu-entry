Croatia  expects a boost in tourism
next year from its entry in the European Union in July and a
sales-tax cut on tourist services to 10 percent from 25 percent
in January, Tourism Minister Veljko Ostojic said.  “These two factors will make Croatian tourism more
competitive in the Mediterranean region,” he told a panel in
Zagreb. He added the government will also step up the sale of
state-owned tourist companies such as Club Adriatic d.o.o. and
Brijuni Rivijera d.o.o.  Tourism accounts for one-fifth of the Adriatic Sea nation’s
economy. Croatia needs foreign investment as it struggles to
revive the economy after three years of recession and
stagnation.  Tourism arrivals in Croatia rose 5 percent in the first 10
months from a year ago, Ostojic said. Visitors from  Germany 
increased 13.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year rise. The
Tourism Ministry relies on data supplied by the Croatian Tourist
Association, which also includes nautical tourism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
