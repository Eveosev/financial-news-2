(Corrects month in the fourth paragraph.)  Wheat fell to the lowest in two
weeks on signs of slack  demand  for inventories from the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture said today it inspected
10.5 million bushels for export in the week through Nov. 8, down
26 percent from the prior week. Inspections from the start of
the marketing year on June 1 have dropped 13 percent to 427.3
million bushels from a year earlier, USDA data show.  “There’s virtually no export business even after
yesterday’s selloff,” Jamey Kohake, a broker and branch manager
at Paragon Investments in Silver Lake,  Kansas , said by
telephone.  Wheat futures for March delivery dropped 0.8 percent to
settle at $8.6575 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the third straight decline. The price touched $8.58, the
lowest since Oct. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
