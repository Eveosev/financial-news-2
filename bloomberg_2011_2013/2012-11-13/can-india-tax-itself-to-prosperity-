India's central and state governments are edging closer to an agreement on a design and deadline for  the Goods and Services Tax , a comprehensive value-added tax that will replace many smaller taxes and levies and will make India a unified market. The proposed  tax reform  has  been described  as having the potential "to be the single most important initiative in the fiscal history of India." Long in the pipeline, the Goods and Services Tax has been on the to-do list of the current government, the UPA, since it came to power in 2004. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram  laid out the need for the switch  in 2006, saying in his budget speech that year: But that date has come and gone without the impasse over the GST being solved, and so have further deadlines. The implementation of the new system has been held up on many fronts: disputes over its precise shape, resistance on the part of some state governments because they fear a loss of revenue from the levy of state taxes, the need  to amend the Constitution  (which has a different view of taxation powers divided between the central government and the state than the one the GST envisages), and the absence of any concerted pressure from the citizenry.  Tax reform  is a subject less conducive to strong feelings than, say,  the proposed anti-corruption bill  that has generated so much sound and fury in India. But not only would the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax increase government revenue, it would have a tonic effect on the battle against corruption, too, by simplifying a byzantine tax system and encouraging what economists call  "virtuous growth."   A strong case for the GST  was made recently in Tehelka by Jaitirth Rao, who pointed out that the current system of multistage taxes on the manufacture and sale of goods and services in India often has a cascading effect, and unfairly penalizes tax compliance and rewards evasion. This system could be rationalized by a sophisticated  last-point retail tax  like the GST. Rao also argued that interstate taxes have created barriers to trade that are holding back the prosperity potentially available to a vast country that works as a unified market, and pointed to the contrast between the U.S. and the smaller economies of  South America  as an example: In  a recent address  to the Indian business confederation  ASSOCHAM , the economist Vijay Kelkar, chairman of a government-appointed committee that produced  a 2009 report  on GST, pointed out the inefficiency of a tax system that required a freight truck travelling by road between Delhi and Chennai "to cross five state borders and 10 checkposts." He gave a sense of the thicket of taxes that would be swept out in one go by the implementation of the proposed  dual-GST model , one designed to ensure that the central government and the states received equal shares of revenue from the tax: Kelkar has  also suggested  that GST implementation would increase  India 's gross domestic product by 1 percent (this contention is supported in   a working paper  by the economists Ehtisham Ahmed and Satya Poddar), bring down real-estate prices and make  Indian manufacturing more competitive  in the global market. Many of the authors of op-eds or academic papers on the subject of the GST have quoted from the ancient Indian thinker Kautilya's text on statecraft, the Arthashastra, and especially  his observation  that "all undertakings [of the state] are dependent first on the treasury." (A full account of Kautilya's thoughts on economics can be found  in this essay , whose authors describe the text as a "neglected precursor to classical economics.") Currently the treasury of India, a country that is home to more than a sixth of the world's population, is messily and inefficiently run, both on the side of personal income-tax -- India currently has a tiny base of  no more than 35 million taxpayers  -- and on the side of taxes on manufacturing and supply. P. Chidambaram, the country's finance minister, and the finance ministers of India's states now have a chance to push through a foundational reform, one that would impact the economic life of every Indian citizen, over the next three months after the GST plan is vetted and refined  by two committees .
