Mozambique’s central bank  lowered 
its benchmark lending rate as inflation remains below target and
global growth slows, threatening the southern African nation’s
expansion.  The standing lending facility was cut 100 basis points, or
1 percentage point, to 9.5 percent, the Maputo-based Bank of
Mozambique said in a  statement  on its website today. It lowered
the deposit rate by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent and left
level of reserves that lenders must hold with the bank at 8
percent.  “The Monetary Policy Committee took note of the worsening
of risks and uncertainty in the global economy,” the bank said.
“Despite the adverse international situation, the MPC confirmed
that the nation’s main economic and financial indicators are in
line with the 2012 macroeconomic plan.”  Mozambique , site of the world’s largest discovery of
natural gas in the last decade, has cut rates six of the last
seven months as it seeks to bolster the nation’s economy. Gross
domestic product expanded 8 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier.  Inflation accelerated to an annual 1.8 percent in October
from 1.55 percent a month earlier, according to the statistics
agency, below the central bank’s targets of 5.6 percent by the
end of December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
