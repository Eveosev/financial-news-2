European Union pig prices were
little changed this week as French hog prices halted a six-week
slide, industry group Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter
Deutschlands e.V. reported.  German pig prices were unchanged for a second week, Damme,
Germany-based ISN wrote in a  report  on its website today. Prices
in  France  rose, while those in Spain fell for a fifth week, the
group said.  Germany  is the EU’s biggest pork producer, followed by
Spain and France, statistics from the bloc show. Prices in the
five biggest producers moved closer in the last few weeks after
declines in France and Spain, according to ISN.  “Most prices move sideways, but the upward turnaround
hoped for by producers hasn’t started yet,” ISN wrote. “Danish
and French prices reached the bottom. The French price crash of
the past six weeks seems to have ended.”  Spanish pig farmers are facing weaker seasonal demand as
well as a Nov. 14 general strike in the country, ISN wrote.  The EU has forecast output of pig meat in the bloc will
decline 3.2 percent next year on higher feed costs and new
animal welfare rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
