Olympic downhill champion  Lindsey Vonn  spent a second night in a Colorado hospital after suffering “severe intestinal pain,” according to a spokesman for the 28- year-old American skier.  “She is resting comfortably and awaiting test results,” Lewis Kay, the spokesman, said last night in an e-mail.  The four-time World Cup overall champion was admitted to a hospital in Vail, the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association said on its website two days ago.  Vonn was in Colorado to prepare for World Cup races on Nov. 24 and 25 in Aspen. She skipped last weekend’s slalom races in Levi,  Finland , to prepare for the U.S. events.
