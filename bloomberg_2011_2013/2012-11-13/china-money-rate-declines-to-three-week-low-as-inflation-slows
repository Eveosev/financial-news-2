China ’s overnight money-market rate
dropped to the lowest level in three weeks on speculation the
central bank will maintain an ample supply of cash after
inflation slowed in October.  The People’s Bank of China added a total of 186 billion
 yuan  ($29.9 billion) via seven- and 28-day reverse-repurchase
agreements to the financial system today, according to a
statement on its website.  Consumer prices  climbed 1.7 percent
from a year earlier, the least since January 2010, the
statistics bureau reported on Nov. 9.  “The reverse repos are the major source of capital for the
financial market,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen
at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender.
“Short-term cash supply is abundant.”  The one-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 20 basis points to 2.33 percent as
of 4:50 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched
2.30 percent earlier, the lowest level since Oct. 23.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined one
basis point to 3.19 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank kept the yields on seven- and 28-day
reverse repos unchanged at 3.35 percent and 3.6 percent,
respectively, according to its statement.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bonds due August
2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.16
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Simon Harvey, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
