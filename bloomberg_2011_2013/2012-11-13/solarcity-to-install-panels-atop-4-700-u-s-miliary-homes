SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , a U.S. developer of
rooftop power projects, will install 13.2 megawatts of solar
panels atop 4,700 homes at U.S. military bases in Texas and New
Mexico.  The initiative is part of the company’s SolarStrong
project, under which it plans to build more than $1 billion in
solar projects at as many as 120,000 military homes in the U.S.,
San Mateo, California-based SolarCity said today in a statement.  The U.S. Defense Department, the largest single energy
consumer in the country, is seeking to get 25 percent of its
electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Installing solar
panels will reduce the homes’ energy costs by about 10 percent,
the company estimated.  “This is a unique; in one community almost every single
household will have solar power,” SolarCity Chief Executive
Officer  Lyndon Rive  said in an interview.  The installations at Fort Bliss in Texas and White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico will be financed mainly by  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  The homes are managed by Balfour Beatty
Communities LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
