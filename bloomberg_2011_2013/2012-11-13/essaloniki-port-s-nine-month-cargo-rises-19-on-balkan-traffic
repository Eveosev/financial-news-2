The port of Thessaloniki,  Greece ’s
second-biggest, handled 19 percent more cargo in the first nine
months of the year as shipments to and from Balkan markets
increased.  Total dry bulk, general cargo, cement and liquid fuel
shipments passing through the port, which markets itself as a
gateway to the Balkans, rose to more than 10.5 million metric
tons in the nine months from 8.8 million in the same period of
2011, according to a  statement  on  Thessaloniki Port Authority
SA (OLTH) ’s website.  The volume of dry bulk and general cargo alone increased
more than 13 percent to more than 5.3 million tons, boosted by
cargo in transit to or from Greece’s northern neighbors that
have little or no coastline, such as  Serbia .  The number of cargo containers handled at Thessaloniki
increased 1 percent to 220,502, while passengers on ships using
the port fell 22 percent to fewer than 45,000.  The government plans to sell stakes in Thessaloniki and
Piraeus ports as part of a program of state asset sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
