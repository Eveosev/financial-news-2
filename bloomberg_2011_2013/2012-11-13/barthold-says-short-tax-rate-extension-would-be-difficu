An extension of expiring tax rates
for any period other than a full year would be challenging, said
Thomas Barthold, chief of staff to the congressional Joint
Committee on Taxation.  The tax system, including filing procedures and reporting
rules for many deductions and credits, is based on an annual
system. A three-month or six-month extension would require
lawmakers to decide how to handle those procedural issues.  “It’s not as easy as going in and changing the dates,”
Barthold said in response to a question at the BloombergBNA Tax
Policy & Practice Summit today in Washington.  Barthold’s office is the nonpartisan official scorekeeper
for tax legislation in Congress.  Tax rates on income,  capital gains , dividends and estates
are scheduled to increase in January as part of the $607 billion
fiscal cliff that Congress is trying to avert.  There has been some discussion in Congress of a short-term
extension of tax cuts first enacted during President  George W. Bush ’s administration. On Sept. 6, Senator  Richard Durbin , an
Illinois Democrat, said lawmakers should consider a six-month
delay in the cliff paired with deficit reduction. He made those
comments in Charlotte,  North Carolina , at the Democratic
National Convention.  To contact the reporter on this story:
