Latvia ’s central bank, which pegs
its currency to the euro, left its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged after cutting it at the last two meetings.  Latvijas Banka  kept the refinancing rate at 2.5 percent,
Governor Ilmars Rimsevics told a news conference today in the
capital, Riga.  The Baltic nation is rebounding from the world’s deepest
recession in 2008-2009, which erased almost a quarter of
economic output after a property bubble burst and credit inflows
dried up, prompting an  International Monetary Fund  bailout. The
economy grew a preliminary 5.3 percent from a year earlier in
the third quarter, the European Union’s quickest pace, while
inflation slowed to a two-year low of 1.6 percent in October,
below the euro-adoption target rate.  “Inflation risks are still limited and the Bank of Latvia
foresees no mid-term risks to  price stability ,” the central
bank said in an e-mailed statement. In addition, “economic
growth has been more sustained than previously predicted.”  The yield on Latvia’s dollar bond due 2021 was little
changed from yesterday at 3.41 percent as of 2:35 p.m. in Riga.
It fell to a low of 3.1911 percent on Oct. 18, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The refinancing rate affects the minimum interest rate on
about 75 million lati ($137 million) a week of central bank
swaps and  repurchase agreements . The bank runs a quasi-currency-
board system, pegged to the euro, where lati in circulation are
backed by foreign currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
