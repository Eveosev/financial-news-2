Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  backed a proposal to link the Fed’s zero  interest-rate  policy to progress toward meeting its goals for inflation and employment rather than to a calendar date.  “The Committee might eliminate the calendar date entirely and replace it with guidance on the economic conditions that would need to prevail before liftoff of the federal funds rate might be judged appropriate,” Yellen said today in the text of remarks prepared for a speech in Berkeley,  California . She is “strongly supportive” of such a change, she said.  Yellen today joined three other Fed officials who have endorsed tying zero interest rates with progress on fighting unemployment as a way to provide more clarity on the central bank’s outlook for monetary policy. The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  said last month it expects to keep its  benchmark rate  near zero through at least mid-2015.  “Under such an approach, liftoff would not be automatic once a threshold is reached,” Yellen said at the  University of California  at Berkeley, where she is a professor emeritus. “That decision would require further Committee deliberation and judgment.”  The Fed may adopt the approach as soon as its next meeting Dec. 11-12, said  Ward McCarthy , chief financial economist at Jefferies Group Inc. in  New York  and a former Richmond Fed economist.  Main Discussion  “They’ve been kicking around the idea of changing the communications policy for a while, and she pretty much summed it up,” McCarthy said. “They want to put rate guidance in the context of the dual-mandate objectives. That was probably the main discussion at the most recent FOMC meeting.”  Since June 2011, Yellen has led a committee created by  Ben S. Bernanke  to shed light on Fed decision-making and minimize public confusion over its goals. The central bank in January took one of its biggest steps ever toward greater openness by publishing a mission statement, an inflation target and anonymous forecasts by each FOMC participant for the benchmark interest rate.  “We’ve made progress, but much work remains to be done,” Yellen, 66, said today.  Stocks fell today as investors watched for progress on  Europe ’s debt crisis and  Washington ’s budget debate. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.4 percent to 1,374.53 at the close of trading in New York. Treasury 10-year note yields fell two basis points to 1.59 percent after earlier falling to 1.57 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 5.  Evans Call  Last year, Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans  first called for the central bank to tie policy to specific numerical thresholds, saying it should keep rates near zero until unemployment falls below 7 percent or inflation rises above 3 percent.  In September, Minneapolis Fed President  Narayana Kocherlakota  endorsed a variation of the pledge, calling for low rates until joblessness falls to 5.5 percent as long as inflation remains below 2.25 percent.  Boston Fed President  Eric Rosengren  said on Nov. 1 the central bank should buy mortgage bonds until the jobless rate falls to 7.25 percent and hold the target interest rate near zero until hitting 6.5 percent unemployment.  Yellen today said the Fed’s 2 percent inflation goal set in January should not be viewed as a ceiling, arguing that such an interpretation would lead to inflation that’s more frequently below the target than above.  Central Tendency  “To balance the chances that inflation will sometimes deviate a bit above and a bit below the goal, 2 percent must be treated as a central tendency around which inflation fluctuates,” she said.  The FOMC’s 19 participants are also considering changes to the Fed’s quarterly publication known as the Summary of Economic Projections, which includes their individual forecasts for gross domestic product, inflation, unemployment and  interest rates , according to their meeting minutes. One possibility would be to provide a consensus forecast by the FOMC’s 12 voting members for the economy and interest rates. Yellen, 66, said changes are under “active consideration.”  “The Committee could provide the public with its projections for inflation and the  unemployment rate  together with what it views as appropriate paths both for the federal funds rate and its asset holdings, conditional on its current outlook for the economy,” she said.  Collective Judgment  The FOMC could also “try to build on the individual projections of macroeconomic variables and policy already included in its quarterly SEP to provide at least some further information about how these individual projections inform the Committee’s collective policy judgment,” she said.  The central bank is “thinking carefully” about the potential adverse effects of a prolonged period of low interest rates, Yellen said in response to a question from the audience. These effects include reducing yields for savers, insurance companies and pension funds, in addition to possibly stoking excessive risk-taking in financial markets, she said.  Still, “we do not have any evidence yet of any increase in risk-taking that would be a major financial-stability concern,” she said.  Fed officials next meet shortly before a measure to extend the average maturity of bonds on the central bank’s balance sheet is scheduled to expire. Fed presidents, including  John Williams  of  San Francisco , have said policy makers may need to expand their latest round of quantitative easing to include Treasuries to offset the end of the so-called Operation Twist program.
