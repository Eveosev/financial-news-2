London police have dropped an
investigation into alleged comments by soccer referee Mark Clattenburg during the Chelsea-Manchester United match last
month.  Metropolitan Police opened the probe Oct. 30 following a
complaint by the Society of Black Lawyers, which called for an
inquiry into whether a criminal offense had been committed.  The police said in a statement today that inquiries into
the incident were made and no victims had come forward.  “Without a victim and/or any evidence that any offense has
been committed, the matter cannot currently be investigated,” a
statement on the police website read. “If the situation changes
and a victim and/or evidence to support an allegation of a crime
comes to police attention then further inquiries will, if
appropriate, be made.”  English soccer’s ruling body is also looking into Chelsea’s
allegation that Clattenburg, 37, made “inappropriate” comments
toward Nigerian midfielder John Obi Mikel during the Blues’ 3-2
loss at  Stamford  Bridge on Oct. 28. Clattenburg hasn’t
officiated since the incident and has denied using inappropriate
language.  To contact the reporter on this story:
