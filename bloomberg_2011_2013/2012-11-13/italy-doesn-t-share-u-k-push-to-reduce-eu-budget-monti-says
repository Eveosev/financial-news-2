The Italian government doesn’t
support a push by U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  to cut the
European Union’s budget, Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said.  “We share the idea that the future budget must be more
oriented toward growth and improving competitiveness in the
European Union,” Monti said at a press conference with Cameron
today in Rome.  “We are less convinced than the U.K. about the need for a
consistent reduction in the dimension of the European budget,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
