Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average capping its longest losing streak in
seven months, as the yen strengthened against all its major
peers, hurting the earnings outlook for exporters.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets almost a third of its
sales in  Europe , dropped 0.5 percent after the euro weakened as
the currency bloc struggled to agree on Greek aid.  Shimizu Corp. (1803) 
fell 5.4 percent to lead declines on the Nikkei 225 after the
contractor cut its earnings forecast. Kyushu Electric Power Co.
led utilities higher after Nomura Holdings Inc. raised its
target price.  “The market does not like it when the yen strengthens,”
said  Masaru Hamasaki , Tokyo-based chief strategist at Toyota
Asset Management Co., which manages the equivalent of $23
billion. “It’s as simple as that.”  The Nikkei 225 dropped 0.2 percent to 8,661.05 at the 3
p.m. close in Tokyo, falling for a seventh straight day and
reversing early gains of as much as 0.5 percent after the yen
strengthened. Volume on the Nikkei was more than 20 percent
below the 30-day average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  was little changed
722.56, with about four shares dropping for every three that
gained.  The Topix has dropped 4.2 percent since Oct. 19 as 55
percent of the companies on the gauge that reported quarterly
earnings missed analysts’ estimates, according to data on 273
corporate results. Shares on the measure traded at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Yen Gains  The yen appreciated to as high as 100.43 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 101.15 when the stock market
opened. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency strengthened to
79.23 from 79.61. A stronger yen cuts overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  European finance ministers struggled to agree on Greek aid,
curbing demand for the common currency and pushing the yen
higher. Luxembourg’s Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said
European ministers will meet again on Nov. 20 to discuss  Greece ,
putting off a decision on how to cover the nation’s need for
additional financing of as much as 32.6 billion euros ($41
billion).  Canon fell 0.5 percent to 2,441 yen. Brother Industries
Ltd., a maker of  office equipment  that gets more than 75 percent
of its sales overseas, lost 1.3 percent to 683 yen, a seventh
straight decrease.  Computer Outage  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.6 percent
today. The  S&P 500  closed yesterday little changed, failing to
rebound from its biggest weekly retreat since June.  Shimizu sank 5.4 percent to 226 yen after slashing its
full-year net-income forecast 45 percent to 5.5 billion yen ($69
million), citing domestic construction projects and unexpected
costs. The company’s equity rating was cut to underperform from
neutral by Credit Suisse Group AG.  Among companies that gained, Kyushu Electric jumped 5.3
percent to 655 yen after Nomura raised the stock price estimate
on the utility to 640 yen from 560 yen. Kansai Electric Power
Co. gained 3.3 percent to 632 yen after the Mainichi newspaper
reported it may get about 300 billion yen in loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
