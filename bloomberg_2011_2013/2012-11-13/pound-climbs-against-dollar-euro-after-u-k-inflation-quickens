The pound advanced against the
dollar and the euro after a report showed U.K. inflation
accelerated more than economists forecast in October.  Britainâ€™s currency strengthened 0.3 percent to 79.78 pence
per euro at 9:33 a.m.  London  time and advanced 0.1 percent to
$1.5898.  Consumer prices rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 2.2 percent in September, the Office for National
Statistics said in London today. Inflation was forecast to
quicken to 2.4 percent, based on the median of 36 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
