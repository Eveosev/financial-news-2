The Egyptian government will respond
on Dec. 18 to a case filed by former presidential candidate
Khaled Ali seeking disclosure of any conditions tied to its $4.8
billion loan talks with the International Monetary Fund, the
country’s Administrative Court said today.  An IMF mission is in Cairo to discuss the country’s
economic and social program, as the government seeks help to
bridge the budget deficit and to win support from other lenders
and donor nations. The loan negotiations process has come under
criticism from rights groups, political parties and labor unions
for lacking transparency.  “The IMF is a political organization, not a charity,” Ali
said at an anti-IMF loan protest yesterday. Ali, who has won
seven cases since last year’s uprising reversing privatization
deals done under former President  Hosni Mubarak , said he was not
invited to any public consultations on the loan the government
said it conducted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
