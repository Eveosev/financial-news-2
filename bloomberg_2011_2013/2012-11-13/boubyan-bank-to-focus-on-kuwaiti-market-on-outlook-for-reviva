Boubyan Bank KSC (BOUBYAN) , 58 percent owned
by the country’s biggest lender, the  National Bank of Kuwait
SAK , expects a “rebound” in the domestic market next year and
said it expects to focus on growth plans in the country.  “The bank has no plans to expand outside  Kuwait  in the
near future and will focus on the local market which is filled
with good opportunities,” Chairman Adel Abdul Wahab al-Majed
said in an e-mailed response to questions on Nov. 11. “We
expect operating conditions in 2013 to rebound and growth in the
credit market to be better than” this year, he said.  Lending is expected to grow between 5 percent and 6 percent
next year, and the effectiveness of a reduction in the central
bank  interest rate  is “tied to a range of other positive
variables,” al-Majed said. The bank cut the interest rate in
October to 2 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began tracking
it 11 years ago, to boost economy growth.  Boubyan Bank said nine-month profit rose by 11 percent to
7.6 million dinars ($26.9 million) from the year-earlier period.
The lender’s shares gained 5 percent this year compared with a
0.4 percent decrease for the benchmark Kuwait Exchange Index.
The stock was unchanged at 620 fils when it last traded on Nov.
