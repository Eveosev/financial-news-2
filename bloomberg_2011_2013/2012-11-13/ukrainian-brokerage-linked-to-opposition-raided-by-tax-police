A Ukrainian investment bank chaired
by the husband of an opposition lawmaker was raided as part of a
probe into  tax evasion .  Officers from the tax police arrived today at  Phoenix
Capital ’s office in the capital, Kiev, according comments by
Lesya Orobets, the wife of the bank’s Chairman Oleksandr
Omelchuk, on her Facebook Inc. page. Several dozen employees are
being held inside the office, she said.  Orobets, a lawmaker from a coalition of opposition parties,
called the raid a pressure tactic in President  Viktor Yanukovych ’s bid to recruit deputies to form a parliamentary
majority. Phoenix is accused of “large-scale tax evasion,”
Serhiy Pototskyi, deputy head of Kiev’s tax administration, said
in televised remarks.  Yanukovych’s ruling Party of Regions won 185 seats in Oct.
28 elections and needs the support of more deputies to secure a
majority in the 450-seat legislature before a new parliament
convenes Dec. 17. Opposition parties united under jailed former
Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko  garnered 101 seats, while world
boxing champion Vitali Klitschko’s UDAR got 40 and the
nationalist Svoboda 37.  Vadym Kolisnichenko, a lawmaker from the Party of Regions,
rejected Orbets’s comments.  “She’s just using her status to protect her business,” he
said by phone. “One should conduct honest accounting and there
will be no problems.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
