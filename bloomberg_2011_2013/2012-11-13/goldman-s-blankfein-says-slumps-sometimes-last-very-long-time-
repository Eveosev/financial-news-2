Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, grappling with a market
slump that is putting trading earnings under pressure, said
“sometimes cycles can last a very long time.”  Still, history shows that New York-based Goldman Sachs
shouldn’t go “overboard” in reacting to downturns, Blankfein,
58, said today at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2012 Banking
and Financial Services Conference in New York. Wall Street has
made past mistakes by cutting too many employees at the bottom
of cycles and over-hiring at the top, he said.  It’s Blankfein’s seventh straight appearance at the annual
event sponsored by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp.  To contact the reporters on this story:
