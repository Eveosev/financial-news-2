Caisse des Depots et Consignations
and Marguerite funds have expressed interest in investing in
Milano Serravalle - Milano Tangenziale SpA, according to Asam
Spa, which is selling its stake in the highway operator.  Italian and international road managers have also expressed
interest, Carmen Zizza, head of investor relations at Asam, said
at a presentation in Paris today. Asam, based in Milan, is
selling its 82 percent stake in Milano Serravalle, the operator
of highways near the Italian city.  The buyer will probably include a toll-road operator in its
investment group, said Zizza, who is in charge of the
privatization of the Italian highway operator. The tenderâ€™s
minimum price is 657.8 million euros ($836 million), and bids
are due Nov. 26. Rothschild is running the tender, she said.  CDC, a French government-owned financial institution based
in Paris, is part of Marguerite, an infrastructure fund
established with the backing of six European banks, according to
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
