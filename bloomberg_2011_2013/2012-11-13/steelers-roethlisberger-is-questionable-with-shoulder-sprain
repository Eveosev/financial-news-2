Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger suffered a sprained throwing shoulder in last
night’s win against Kansas City and will undergo further tests
today to determine the extent of the injury.  Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said at a news conference that
Roethlisberger “is in the questionable category” as the team
prepares to host the American Football Conference North
Division-leading Baltimore Ravens on Nov. 18. Pittsburgh (6-3)
plays the Ravens (7-2) twice in the next three weeks.  Roethlisberger, who has led the Steelers to two Super Bowl
titles in his nine National Football League seasons, was knocked
out of last night’s game on the opening drive of the second half
after being sacked and driven to the ground by Chiefs
linebackers Tamba Hali and Justin Houston.  Before the Steelers’ completed the 16-13 overtime victory,
Roethlisberger left the stadium with his arm in a sling and was
taken to a hospital for evaluation. Tomlin said today that the
initial diagnosis shows that Roethlisberger has a
sternoclavicular strain, an injury to the joint between the
collar bone and the breastbone. He wouldn’t speculate on how
much time Roethlisberger might miss.  Byron Leftwich replaced Roethlisberger in the second half
last night and completed 7-of-14 passes for 73 yards.
Roethlisberger has passed for 2,287 yards, 17 touchdowns and
four interceptions this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
