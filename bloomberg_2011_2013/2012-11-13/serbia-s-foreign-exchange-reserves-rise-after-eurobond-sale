Serbia’s foreign-exchange reserves
rose 330 million euros ($420 million) in October, after the
Balkan country sold a $1 billion Eurobond.  Reserves increased to 10.16 billion euros in October from
9.83 billion euros a month earlier, their lowest in 22 months,
Narodna Banka Srbije, the country’s central bank said in an e-
mailed statement today. Loans and donations brought in further
31.2 million euros.  Outflows included 209.7 million euros that banks withdrew
from their mandatory reserve accounts, while the state spent
117.7 million euros to repay foreign creditors.  Net reserves, excluding the money commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , increased to 6.02 billion euros from 5.48 billion euros at
the end of September, the central bank said.  Interbank foreign-currency trading soared almost 54 percent
to 1.88 billion euros, bringing the ten-month volume to 14.5
billion euros, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
