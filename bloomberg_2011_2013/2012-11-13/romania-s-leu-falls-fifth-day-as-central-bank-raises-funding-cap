The leu weakened for a fifth day
after  Romania ’s central bank raised a cap on lending at its
repurchase agreements auction, increasing the amount of funding.  The leu depreciated 0.1 percent to 4.5362 per euro by 5:15
p.m. in Bucharest, the lowest level on a closing basis since
Oct. 31. Yields on 2019 Eurobonds declined six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 4.92 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei increased the funding limit
to 6 billion lei ($1.7 billion) in a weekly repo sale yesterday,
compared with 4 billion lei on Nov. 5 and Oct. 29. It last
offered 6 billion lei on Oct. 15. Romania’s inflation rate
unexpectedly slid to 5 percent in October from 5.3 percent a
month earlier, below the median estimate of 13 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The central banks’ measure may be seen as “a sign that the
Bank is easing its grip of the foreign exchange market,” Mihai Tantaru, a Bucharest-based economist at ING Bank Romania SA,
wrote in a note today. “We see the leu stalling around 4.53 per
euro today, with possible occasional spikes towards 4.54 per
euro.”  Romania is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections on
Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
