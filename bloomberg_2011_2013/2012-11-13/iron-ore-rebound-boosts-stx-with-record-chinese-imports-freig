China , which imports more  iron ore 
than the rest of the world combined, will buy a record amount
this quarter, easing concern about the engine of global economic
growth and extending a two-month rally in shipping rates.  Capesizes, carrying more ore than any other vessel class,
will earn $12,000 a day in the first quarter, says Arctic
Securities ASA, a bank in Oslo whose recommendations on shipping
stocks returned 17 percent in a year. Investors may profit from
that because freight swaps for the period are trading at $8,075.
Fourth-quarter shipments will rise 5.5 percent from a year
earlier to 188 million metric tons, according to the median of
11 analyst, trader and broker estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Just two months after plunging iron-ore prices signaled
China’s seven-quarter slowdown would worsen, the government’s
$158 billion roads-to-sewers stimulus plan unveiled in September
is boosting demand for the commodity and diminishing a glut in
shipping.  STX Pan Ocean Co. (028670) , which has the highest proportion of
Capesizes in its fleet among the five largest owners, will
return to profit in 2013 after two years of losses, the median
of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We’re finally getting back into a period when the market
isn’t so oversupplied,” said  Jeffrey Landsberg , the managing
director of Commodore Research & Consultancy in  New York , who
correctly predicted that shipping rates would rebound last
month. “When we do have sharp increases in demand, Capesize
rates can rise significantly.”  Maritime Routes  Earnings for the ships, each carrying about 160,000 tons of
ore, jumped more than fourfold to $15,422 a day since the end of
August, according to the Baltic Exchange, the London-based
publisher of costs on more than 50 marine routes. While Arctic’s
predicted first-quarter rate would be up 72 percent from a year
earlier, it’s still below what most owners need to break even.  Capesize rates averaged $7,030 since the start of January,
heading for the lowest annual figure since at least 1999,
according to  Baltic Exchange  data. Earnings exceeded the $16,400
that Pareto Securities AS estimates owners need to break even in
only 10 sessions this year.  The government in Beijing, which began a once-a-decade
 leadership transition  last week, approved plans to build 1,254
miles of roads, nine sewage-treatment plants, five port and
warehouse projects, and two waterway improvements. That
coincided with central-bank pledges from the U.S. to  Europe  to
 Japan  to do more to bolster growth.  Ore Exporter  Shares of Seoul-based STX Pan Ocean will advance 57 percent
to 4,852 won in 12 months, based on the average of 16 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Rising demand for ore will also
boost earnings for mining companies.  Vale SA (VALE3) , the biggest iron-
ore exporter, will report a 13 percent gain in net income next
year, the average of 12 predictions shows.  Ore at the Chinese port of Tianjin, a global benchmark,
traded at $122.10 a dry ton on Nov. 12, from $86.70 on Sept. 5,
according to The Steel Index Ltd., owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. Dry
tons exclude moisture and are used to standardize cargoes. The
price of steel reinforcement bars used in construction jumped 11
percent on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  The fourth-quarter import estimates ranged from 182 million
tons to 206 million tons. Purchases totaled 56.43 million tons
last month, China’s customs bureau said Nov. 10 on its website,
down 13 percent from a 20-month high reached in September.
Imports fell in October in each of the last five years, customs
data show. The country will ship in 184.5 million tons in the
first three months of 2013, down from an all-time high of 187.2
million tons this year, the Bloomberg survey showed.  Consumption Growth  Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  cut the nation’s annual growth
target to 7.5 percent in March, the lowest since 2004. HSBC
Holdings Plc reduced its 2013 iron-ore forecast by 27 percent to
$105 a ton on Oct. 12, citing weaker demand from the Asian
nation. While China’s steel consumption growth will accelerate
to 3.1 percent next year, from 2.5 percent in 2012, it will be
slower than the 6.2 percent recorded in 2011, the Brussels-based
World Steel Association estimates.  China COSCO Holdings Co., the country’s largest Capesize
operator, will report a net loss of $168.1 million for next
year, according to the mean of 23 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Shares of the Tianjin-based company will decline 4.4
percent in 12 months, the average of  25 predictions  shows.  Dry Index  Earnings that reached a record $234,000 in 2008 spurred
owners to order too many ships. The fleet expanded 91 percent
since then as demand grew 23 percent, according to data from the
Baltic Exchange and London-based Clarkson Plc, the world’s
biggest shipbroker. The glut extends across most of the shipping
industry. The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of costs across four
vessel classes, fell 44 percent this year and rates for the
largest  oil tankers  plunged 42 percent.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its global growth
forecast twice since July. The Washington-based group still
expects the global economy to expand 3.3 percent this year and
3.6 percent in 2013. About 90 percent of trade goes by sea, the
Round Table of International Shipping Associations estimates.  While outstanding orders at shipyards are still equal to 18
percent of existing capacity, the worst is over. Builders had
contracts equal to all the vessels already on the water in 2008,
IHS Inc. data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The fleet contracted 0.6 percent last month, the first drop
since November 2008. Owners will demolish carriers with record
total capacity of 12.8 million deadweight tons this year,
Clarkson estimates.  Bangladesh , the world’s second-largest
recycler, is running out of room for dismantling vessels,
according to Global Marketing Systems Inc., the largest cash
buyer of ships for scrap.  Morgan Stanley  Global fleet growth will slow to 4 percent in 2013, from 14
percent this year, Clarkson estimates. Demand for dry-bulk
cargoes will gain 4 percent to a record 4.1 billion tons in
2013. Iron ore accounted for 69 percent of spot business on
Capesizes in the past 12 months, according to Morgan Stanley.  Mining companies outside China are expanding output to meet
demand, with an additional 174.6 million tons of production
scheduled for 2013, from 30.8 million tons this year, according
to data compiled by Kenneth Hoffman, a Bloomberg Industries
analyst in Skillman,  New Jersey .  Shares of Rio de Janeiro-based Vale will rise 28 percent to
$22.99 in 12 months, according to the average of 21 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. STX Pan Ocean will report net
income of $1.8 million for 2013 after losing $221.3 million this
year, according to the average of three estimates.  Container Ships  The three biggest Capesize owners are Nippon Yusen Kaisha
K.K., Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd.,
according to data from Clarkson. Their fleets also include oil
tankers and container ships.  China’s economy  will grow 7.7 percent this quarter and
accelerate in each of the next three periods, the mean of as
many as 31 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. Its
iron-ore imports will rise 8 percent to a record 779 million
tons next year, Clarkson estimates.  “The fear is Chinese growth will slow, and it will take
the market time to work off the oversupply of ships,” said
analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth of Arctic Securities. “But with
signs pointing to imports staying strong into next year, there’s
reason to be optimistic about rates in the first quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
