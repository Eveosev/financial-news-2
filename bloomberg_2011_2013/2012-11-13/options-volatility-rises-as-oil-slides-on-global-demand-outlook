Crude oil options volatility rose as
futures slipped after the  International Energy Agency  reduced
its world oil-demand forecast for the quarter and a survey
projected U.S. supplies jumped to a three-month high.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30.6 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange as of 3:35 p.m., an increase from 30.4
percent yesterday.  January-delivery crude oil fell 23 cents to settle at
$85.84 a barrel on the Nymex.  Global consumption in the fourth quarter will average 90.1
million barrels a day, which is 290,000 barrels a day, or 0.3
percent, less than previously forecast, the Paris-based energy
agency said in a monthly report today.  “The IEA report is playing into the weak demand
sentiment,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “A lot of people are nervous.”  U.S. oil supplies probably rose 2.5 million barrels last
week, according to the median estimate of nine analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $85 puts, which fell 33 cents to 3 cents a barrel on
volume of 8,356 lots at 3:43 p.m. May $50 puts were the second-
most active, with 3,702 lots exchanged as they held steady at 13
cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 56
percent of the 72,995 lots traded.  Exchange Data  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts made up 53 percent of the
