Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  provided
$1.85 billion in new debt for hotels owned by Kyo-Ya Hotels &
Resorts LP, including the Sheraton Waikiki in Hawaii and the
Palace Hotel in  San Francisco .  The debt, provided by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., includes
first mortgage and mezzanine loans, the New York-based company
said in a statement today.  Cerberus Capital Management LP, which owns Kyo-Ya, in May
was seeking to replace debt amassed in 2006, three people
familiar with the transaction said at the time. A deal struck
with Goldman Sachs failed to close last year.  Five of the Kyo-Ya hotels are in Hawaii, including the
Westin Moana Surfrider and Sheraton Princess Kaiulani in
Honolulu. Oahu has been outperforming other U.S. markets. This
year through September, hotel occupancies on the island climbed
to 86 percent, the highest of 25 U.S. markets tracked by Smith
Travel Research Inc., based in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Thatâ€™s
up from 81 percent a year ago, the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
