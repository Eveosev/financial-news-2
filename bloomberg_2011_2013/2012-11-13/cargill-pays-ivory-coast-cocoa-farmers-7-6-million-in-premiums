Cargill Inc. paid $7.6 million in
certified cocoa premiums to farmers in  Ivory Coast , the world’s
biggest producer of the chocolate ingredient, in the 2011-12
season that ran through September.  About 26,500 farmers in 43 cooperatives certified by UTZ
and Rainforest Alliance received the payments, the Minneapolis-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement. This year’s
payout raised farmers’ direct revenues by 17 percent on average,
said Cargill, the largest closely held U.S. company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
