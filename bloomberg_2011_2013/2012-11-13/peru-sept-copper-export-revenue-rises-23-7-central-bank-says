Peruâ€™s copper export revenue rose
23.7 percent from a year ago as higher shipments offset price
declines, the central bank said.  Copper sales of 143,800 metric tons climbed to $1.07
billion from 101,900 metric tons worth $866 million a year
earlier, the central bank said today in a statement posted on
its  website .  Gold exports fell to 407,400 ounces worth $711 million from
539,100 ounces worth $956 million a year earlier, the bank said.
Total metal exports climbed 2.4 percent to $2.31 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
