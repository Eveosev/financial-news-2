A panel of U.S. financial
regulators today began pushing the Securities and Exchange
Commission to make new rules for the $2.6 trillion money-market
mutual funds industry by endorsing a draft of recommended
overhaul options.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group
formed by the Dodd-Frank Act and charged with addressing
systemic financial risks, approved a set of options outlined in
a Sept. 27 letter by its chairman, Treasury Secretary  Timothy
Geithner .  The recommendations included two measures opposed by the
funds industry and rejected in August by a majority of SEC
commissioners, and a third option that would include a variable-
level capital buffer as high as 3 percent of assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
