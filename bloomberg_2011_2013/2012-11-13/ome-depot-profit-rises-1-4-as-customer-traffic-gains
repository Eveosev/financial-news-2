Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, posted third-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates as the recovering U.S. housing market
prompted customers to spend more on home repairs.  Net income climbed 1.4 percent to $947 million, or 63 cents
a share, from $934 million, or 60 cents, a year earlier, the
Atlanta-based company said today in a statement. Excluding some
items, profit was 74 cents. The average  estimate  of 25 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 70 cents. Sales rose 4.6 percent to
$18.1 billion, topping the $17.9 billion average estimate.  The U.S. housing market is healing, with new-home sales
rising to the fastest pace in two years and construction
starting at the fastest rate in four years. The rebound has
helped sales at Home Depot locations open at least a year gain
4.2 percent, the sixth straight quarterly  increase , as customers
visited more often and spent more per trip.  Home Depot “did an excellent job driving its sales growth
with lower promotions,” John Tomlinson, an analyst at ITG
Investment Research in New York, said today in an e-mail.
“There is no doubt improvements in housing turnover and home
prices are also positively impacting its sales trends.”  Home Depot rose 3.6 percent to $63.38 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain since Dec. 20. The shares have climbed 51
percent this year.  Housing Rebound  New-home  sales  in September climbed 5.7 percent to a
389,000 annual pace, the most since April 2010, according to the
Commerce Department. Housing  starts  that month jumped 15 percent
to the fastest rate since July 2008, a report last month showed.
Beginning construction rose to an 872,000 annual rate, exceeding
all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey, Commerce Department figures
showed.  Americans’ real estate holdings have risen in value for two
straight quarters, making them worth $730 billion more than at
the end of 2011, Federal Reserve data show. More than 1.3
million homeowners who had owed more than their property was
worth have moved above the break-even point on their homes,
according to CoreLogic of Santa Ana,  California . U.S. home
prices rose 4.6 percent in August from a year earlier, according
to the service.  Those rising property values are bolstering household
finances and spurring the consumer spending that accounts for 70
percent of the economy.  Sales this year will gain 5.2 percent, Home Depot said
today. That’s up from a previous projection for a 4.6 percent
gain. Profit excluding the effect of closing seven stores in
 China  will be $3.03 a share, up from a previous forecast of
$2.95 and topping the $2.98 average  estimate .  Customer Traffic  Home Depot’s average transaction value in the third quarter
rose 2.9 percent to $54.55 while the number of purchases climbed
1.7 percent to 331 million.  The earnings reflect “the start of the path toward the
healing of the housing market,” Chief Executive Officer Frank Blake said in the statement.  The company plans to buy back about $700 million in shares
in the fourth quarter, bringing its total repurchases for the
year to about $4 billion, Home Depot said.  Hurricane Sandy , which slammed into the East Coast two
weeks ago, will result in a sales boost similar to the one
provided by Hurricane Irene, which added about $360 million in
sales last year, executives said today on a conference call.  Lowe’s Cos. (LOW) , the second-biggest home improvement retailer,
plans to report third-quarter results Nov. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
