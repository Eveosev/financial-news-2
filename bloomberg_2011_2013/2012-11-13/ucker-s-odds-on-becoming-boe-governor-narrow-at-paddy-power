Bank of England Deputy Governor  Paul Tucker ’s odds of becoming the next governor narrowed at  Paddy
Power Plc. (PAP)   The price on Tucker replacing  Mervyn King  in June shortened
to 1-3 from 4-9, meaning a successful 3-pound bet would win a 1-
pound profit, the Dublin-based bookmaker said on its website.
The second favorite for the role is Terence Burns, former
Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, at 13-2.  Tucker’s position as the favorite for getting the top
central bank job wobbled earlier this year as he and his
colleagues were embroiled in the Libor scandal, and he briefly
lost his lead position to Gus O’Donnell, former head of the
civil service.  The application deadline for the Bank of England job was
Oct. 8, and Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  plans to
announce his choice by the end of the year. O’Donnell said he
didn’t apply. Adair Turner, head of the Financial Services
Authority, and John Vickers, a former central bank chief
economist, are both tied at Paddy Power at odds of 7-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
