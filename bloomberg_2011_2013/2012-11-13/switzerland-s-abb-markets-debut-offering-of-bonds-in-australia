ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the world’s largest maker
of power transformers, is marketing at least A$300 million ($313
million) of bonds in its debut debt offering in  Australia .  The Zurich-based company’s ABB Finance (Australia) Pty unit
is seeking to sell five-year notes yielding about 120 basis
points more than the swap rate, according to an e-mailed
statement from Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., which
is managing the deal with UBS AG. The sale will be the first
that ABB has marketed in the South Pacific nation, and its first
in the Australian currency since a A$100 million sale of so-
called Eurobonds in 1997,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Issuers are showing renewed interest in Australian
corporate bonds after yield premiums tumbled to a 16-month low
and investors demonstrated they’re willing to provide larger
pools of funding. Telstra Corp. sold its biggest-ever debt issue
in the nation on Nov. 8 after BHP Billiton Ltd. priced A$1
billion of notes last month in the first Australian dollar-
denominated sale from the world’s biggest miner in more than a
decade, Bloomberg-compiled data show.  ABB plans to price its offering tomorrow, according to the
statement. The company has an A credit rating from Standard &
Poor’s, the sixth-highest grade, and the equivalent A2 from
Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
