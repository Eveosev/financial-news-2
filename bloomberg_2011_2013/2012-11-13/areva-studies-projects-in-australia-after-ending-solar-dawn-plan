Areva SA (AREVA)  said it’s considering a
“pipeline of opportunities” in Australia after scrapping its
proposed A$1 billion ($1 billion) Solar Dawn project in
Queensland state and failing to get government funds.  The Paris-based company’s solar unit looks forward to
working with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to expand
the industry, it said today in an e-mailed response to
questions. The government agency said Nov. 12 that it wouldn’t
fund the planned 250-megawatt Solar Dawn plant.  Australia is continuing talks with two other solar-power
projects involving Pacific Hydro Pty and  Suntech Power Holdings
Co. (STP)  about funding their proposed developments as the country
moves toward a target of getting 20 percent of its power from
renewable energy by the end of the decade.  Areva is helping CS Energy build the A$104.7 million Kogan
Creek Solar Boost project integrating solar technology with a
coal-fired power station in Queensland,  its website shows.   “The company is also pursuing a pipeline of opportunities
in  Australia  and looks forward to continuing to work with
parties in the market who are currently putting plans in place
to meet their renewable energy targets and reduce their carbon
footprint,” according to the statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
