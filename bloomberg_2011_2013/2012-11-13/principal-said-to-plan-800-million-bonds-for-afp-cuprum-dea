Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) , the
seller of life insurance and retirement products that is
acquiring Chile’s  AFP Cuprum SA (CUPRUM) , issued $900 million of bonds in
three parts to help fund the purchase.  Principal sold $300 million each of 1.85 percent, five-year
debt yielding 125 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, 3.125 percent notes due in May 2023 at a relative
yield of 155 basis points and 4.35 percent bonds with a May 2043
maturity at a 165 basis-point spread, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The sale was initially marketed at $800 million,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  Proceeds will help fund a tender offer for Cuprum shares,
the  Des Moines , Iowa-based company said today in a regulatory
filing. Principal is acquiring  Chile ’s fourth-largest pension
manager for $1.5 billion as it looks to add fee income from
Latin America. The new bonds will be redeemed at 101 cents on
the dollar if the deal is not completed by Nov. 19, 2013.  Principal last sold debt in September, issuing $500 million
of 1.125 percent, three-year securities at a spread of 80 basis
points, Bloomberg data show. The bonds were quoted at 100.7
cents on the dollar to yield 0.88 percent Nov. 9, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The new bonds were rated BBB+ at  Standard & Poor’s ,
Bloomberg data show. They may be graded A3 by Moody’s Investors
Service, according to the person, who asked not to be identified
citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. Credit Suisse
Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG
managed the sale, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
