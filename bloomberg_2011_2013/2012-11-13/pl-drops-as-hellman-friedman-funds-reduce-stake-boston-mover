LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (LPLA) , the
Boston-based brokerage and investment advisory firm, dropped as
much as 17 percent after one of its main private-equity
investors signalled plans to reduce a stake.  Hellman & Friedman LLC funds plan to distribute 8.1 million
shares to their investors, cutting a combined holding by about
30 percent, LPL said today in a regulatory filing. LPL recovered
after falling as low as $23.17. It was down 5.1 percent to
$26.55 as of 11:01 a.m. in New York.  LPL, which provides brokerage and technology services to
investment advisers who manage money for individuals, has
dropped 12 percent since it went public for $30 a share in 2010.
San Francisco-based Hellman & Friedman and TPG Capital are the
firmâ€™s largest investors, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
