EDF Energies Nouvelles, the
renewable energy unit of France’s  EDF SA (EDF) , completed Europe’s
largest photovoltaic plant in the northeast of the country.  The developer opened the 115-megawatt Toul-Rosieres project
at a former military air base near Nancy using about 1.4 million
thin-film solar panels from U.S. manufacturer  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) ,
EDF said in a statement today. The project started in 2009 and
has been commissioned in stages since May, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
