Nautilus Minerals Inc. (NUS) , seeking to
be the first large-scale miner of copper and gold from the ocean
bottom, fell the most in more than seven years after halting
equipment construction to avoid running out of cash.  The shares fell 43 percent to 41 Canadian cents at the
close in Toronto, the biggest drop since Dec. 29, 2004. The
shares have lost 77 percent this year.  Nautilus is halting construction of its Seafloor Production
System and firing 60 workers, the Toronto-based company said
today in a statement. The company can no longer afford to fund
the project alone amid a dispute with the government of Papua
New Guinea over shared development costs, according to the
statement.  “There will be a considerable delay in any commencement of
production operations and it may also result in an increase in
the project cost,” the company said in the statement.  Nautilus was awarded the world’s first deep-sea mining
lease by the government of Papua New Guinea in January 2011.  The company’s biggest shareholders are Moscow-based
Metalloinvest Holding Ltd., which owned 17 percent of the
company’s shares as of May 1, London-based  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,
and MB Holding Company LLC, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
