Electricite de France SA , the
biggest operator of nuclear reactors, cut its full-year target
for French atomic output and said profit could be little changed
next year.  Sales (EDF)  in the first nine months of the year rose 6.6 percent
on a like-for-like basis to 52 billion euros ($66 billion), the
Paris-based company said today in a statement.  The state-controlled utility warned that earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization could be “stable”
next year with growth returning in 2014. That compares with a
previous medium-term target of Ebitda growth of 4 percent to 6
percent on average a year through 2015.  EDF reiterated targets for Ebitda growth of 4 percent to 6
percent in 2012, and growth in net income excluding non-
recurring items of 5 percent to 10 percent. Dividends will be
“at least stable” this year, while debt will drop below 2.5
times Ebitda through 2015, the utility said.  The company lowered its forecast for atomic output in
 France  to about 410 terawatt-hours this year from 415 terawatt-
hours.  The utility said production fell 6.2 percent to 295
terawatt-hours during the first nine months compared with the
same period last year.  EDF has extended maintenance halts and safety inspections
at its French reactors after the regulator, the Autorite de
Surete Nucleaire, demanded more stringent checks and upgrades
following  Japan ’s Fukushima crisis.  EDF’s 58 reactors in France generate about three-quarters
of the country’s power, a higher share than any other nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
