U.S. stocks trimmed gains as
financial and technology shares turned lower, weighing on an
earlier rally led by retailers after Home Depot Inc.’s earnings

percent at 1,381.12 at 3:11 p.m. in  New York , paring a morning
rally of as much as 0.6 percent. Technology shares in the S&P
500 lost 0.3 percent as a group and financials retreated 0.2
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
