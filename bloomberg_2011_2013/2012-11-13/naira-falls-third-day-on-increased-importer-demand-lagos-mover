Nigeria’s naira capped its biggest
three-day retreat in a month as importer demand for dollars was
said to increase on reduced oil company foreign-exchange sales
in the interbank market.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer slipped less
than 0.1 percent to 157.875 a dollar by 4:22 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has slipped 0.5 percent in the
past three days, the worst performance since Oct. 9, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The weaker naira is attributed to increased importer
dollar demand,”  Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall, sub-Saharan Africa
strategists at Citigroup Inc. in Johannesburg, wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients today. “Oil companies have also not been
present selling dollars.”  Oil-producing companies, which sell dollars to meet
domestic expenses, are the second-biggest source of foreign
currency after the central bank, which sells dollars on Mondays
and Wednesdays to keep the naira within a 3 percent band around
155 per dollar.  The Abuja-based Central Bank of Nigeria sold $150 million
at its foreign currency auction yesterday, it said in an e-
mailed statement. The regulator sold  $79.9 million  at its two
scheduled auctions last week, the lowest since December 2009,
according to data on the its website.  The yield on the 16.39 percent naira debt due January 2022
rose nine basis points to 12.74 percent, according to
yesterday’s prices compiled by the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association. Borrowing costs on the nation’s $500
million of Eurobonds due January 2021 declined two basis points
to 4.4 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi gained less than 0.1 percent to 1.8766 a
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
