Oil declined for a second day in  New
York  amid speculation that U.S. crude inventories rose last week
and after the  International Energy Agency  cut its forecast for
global demand growth this quarter.  Futures slipped as much as 1.2 percent. U.S. crude
stockpiles probably increased last week to the highest level in
more than three months, according to a Bloomberg survey before
an Energy Department report on Nov. 15. OPEC will need to pump
less crude this quarter as demand growth slows, the IEA said.
Oil slid yesterday as investors awaited budget talks in the
U.S., and extended losses after European leaders said they’ll
meet again Nov. 20 to discuss additional funding for  Greece .  “Primarily bearish winds are blowing in oil markets at the
moment,” said Filip Petersson, a commodities strategist at SEB
AB in  Stockholm  who predicts  Brent crude  will average $110 a
barrel this quarter. “On the macro side, bearish influences are
coming from a new wave of Greek worries and the approaching U.S.
fiscal cliff.”  Crude for December delivery slid as much as 99 cents to
$84.58 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $85.10 at 1:30 p.m. London time. The
contract fell 50 cents to $85.57 yesterday. Prices are down 14
percent this year.  Brent for December settlement declined 99 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $108.08 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $22.98 to West Texas Intermediate futures, compared
with $23.50 yesterday.  Crude Output  U.S. crude inventories probably rose  2.5 million barrels  to
377.3 million, according to the median estimate of seven
analysts in the Bloomberg survey before the Energy Department
report. Gasoline supplies climbed  800,000 barrels  while
distillate stockpiles declined 500,000 barrels, according to the
survey. The inventory data will be released Nov. 15, a day later
than usual because of the Veterans Day holiday yesterday.  Global oil consumption will average 90.1 million barrels a
day this quarter, which is 290,000 barrels a day, or 0.3 percent
less than previously forecast, the Paris-based IEA said in its
monthly report today.  “The market is very well supplied,” Abdalla El-Badri,
OPEC’s secretary-general, said today at the Oil & Money
conference in London. “There is no doubt about it. Stocks are
very high.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will need
to supply 30 million barrels a day this quarter, 500,000 barrels
a day less than previously projected because of the weaker
demand outlook and expectations for increased non-OPEC supply,
the IEA said. Global demand will rise by 830,000 barrels a day
in 2013 to 90.4 million, 70,000 barrels less than last month’s
forecast.  U.S., Europe  President  Barack Obama  invited the Democratic and
Republican leaders in Congress to the White House this week to
begin talks on a plan to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. If
Congress doesn’t act by the end of the year, $607 billion in
automatic spending cuts and tax increases are scheduled to take
effect starting in January.  “The biggest challenge we are facing is the U.S. fiscal
cliff,” El-Badri said.  European finance ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday
put off until Nov. 20 a decision on how to cover additional
Greek needs of as much as 32.6 billion euros ($41 billion) and
left unclear whether the  International Monetary Fund  will
continue to contribute. They granted the country a two-year
extension to 2016 to cut its  budget deficit  to 2 percent of
gross domestic product.  Buzzard Field  The Buzzard oil field in the  North Sea  resumed production
late yesterday after halting during the Nov. 10 to Nov. 11
weekend, according to three people with knowledge of the matter,
who declined to be identified as the information is
confidential.  The 200,000 barrel-a-day Buzzard field is the biggest
contributor to Forties crude. Buzzard restarted production on
Nov. 3 after two months of maintenance, Nexen Inc., the operator
of the field, said on Nov. 5. Two officials at Nexen, based in
Calgary,  Canada , didn’t immediately respond to e-mails from
Bloomberg today seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
