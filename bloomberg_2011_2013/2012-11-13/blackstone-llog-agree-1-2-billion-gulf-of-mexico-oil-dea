Blackstone Group LP (BX)  started a
partnership with LLOG Exploration Co., an unlisted  oil company ,
to invest more than $1.2 billion in offshore operations in the
Gulf of Mexico.  The cash will be used to speed up development of four
deepwater discoveries as well as for new exploration and buying
more assets, according to a statement today. Covington,
Louisiana-based LLOG said it’s one of the largest private
operators in the Gulf, with an exploration success rate of 70
percent.  “With Blackstone’s team, extensive capital resources, oil
and gas expertise and industry resources, we will be able to
take our business activity levels and assets to the next
level,” said Scott Gutterman, chief executive officer of LLOG.  Production from LLOG’s Who Dat discovery, which holds as
much as 300 million barrels of oil equivalent, is excluded from
the partnership. LLOG said it started production from the field
last year.  Blackstone, the New York-based private-equity firm, in
September completed gathering $2.5 billion for its debut energy
fund, Blackstone Energy Partners. Blackstone has more than $205
billion in assets under management, it said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
