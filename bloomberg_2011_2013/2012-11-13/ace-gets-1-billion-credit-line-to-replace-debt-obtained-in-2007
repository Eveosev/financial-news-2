Ace Ltd. (ACE) , a Swiss property and
casualty insurance business, got a $1 billion unsecured credit
line to replace debt it obtained in 2007.  The full amount may be used for letters of credit and as
much as $300 million for revolving loans, the  company  said today
in a regulatory filing. Ace may increase the pact to $1.5
billion.  Wells Fargo & Co. led a group of lenders providing the loan
to the Zurich, Switzerland-based  insurer , according to the
filing. The deal, which may also be used for working capital and
general corporate purposes, replaces $1.5 billion of credit
agreements from five years ago.  Ace operates in 53 countries, providing commercial and
personal property and casualty insurance, personal accident and
supplemental health insurance, reinsurance and  life insurance ,
according to its  website .  Under a revolver, money can be borrowed again once itâ€™s
repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
