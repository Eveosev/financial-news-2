Wholesale electricity prices from
 Maine  to the mid-Atlantic states advanced as forecasts for
colder weather signaled stronger heating demand.  Winter on-peak power  at PJM Interconnection LLC’s West Hub,
the benchmark for the 13-state eastern U.S. grid, rose $1.20, or
2.5 percent, to $49.25 a megawatt-hour at 1:38 p.m., the highest
price since Oct. 24, 2011. The winter power price covers January
and February. The grid delivers power to 60 million people from
New Jersey to North Carolina and  Illinois .  Prices on the grid operated by ISO New England Inc. climbed
12 percent to $76.25 a megawatt-hour for the same winter months,
said Tom Hahn, vice president of U.S. power derivatives at
brokerage ICAP Energy LLC in Durham, North Carolina.  “The leg up here today is all weather,” following above-
normal temperatures early this week, Hahn said. “There is a
cold front coming across the East Coast and it looks like it’s
going to be cold for a while.”  Temperatures will normal or lower along the East Coast over
the next 15 days, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The low in  Boston  will drop to 25 degrees Fahrenheit (minus
4 Celsius), 10 below normal, on Nov. 26, compared with 47
degrees yesterday, 8 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc.
in State College,  Pennsylvania .  Washington ’s low will be 11
below the usual reading at 27 degrees on Nov. 27 versus 49
yesterday, 7 above the norm.  Gains in costs for natural gas, a power-plant fuel, are
also boosting electricity prices, Hahn said.  Gas for December delivery rose 15.8 cents, or 4.4 percent,
to $3.728 per million British thermal units at 1:39 p.m. on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.  About 39 percent of U.S. households rely on electricity as
their primary heating fuel while about 50 percent use natural
gas, according to the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
