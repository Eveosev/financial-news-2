A group of 10 institutional
investors that own Argentina’s restructured bonds has hired U.S.
lawyer  David Boies  to advise them on how to prevent a case
involving holders of the country’s defaulted debt triggering a
fresh default by the South American country, newspaper La Nacion
said, citing two people familiar with the matter.  The group is also considering collecting interest payments
in France or Switzerland, beyond the reach of U.S. District
Judge Thomas Griesa, who will decide how much Argentina should
pay the so-called holdouts when it makes distributions due on
the nation’s securities next month, the Buenos Aires-based
newspaper said.  Boies didn’t immediately respond to two telephone calls and
an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
