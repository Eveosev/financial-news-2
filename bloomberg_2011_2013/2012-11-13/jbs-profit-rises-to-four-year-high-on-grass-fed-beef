JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, posted its highest quarterly profit in four years amid
its reliance on South America’s low cost, grass-fed cattle.  Net income was 367 million reais ($178.3 million) in the
third quarter, the Sao Paulo-based company said in a statement
today. The result is below a forecast gain of 386 million reais,
excluding one-time items, the average of nine estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. JBS reported a loss of 67.5 million reais a year
earlier.  JBS is benefiting from lower cattle prices in the Mercosur
region, Thiago Duarte, a Sao Paulo-based analyst with Banco BTG
Pactual SA, said in an Oct. 29 note to clients. The company also
had higher beef sales and margins, said Duarte, who has a buy
recommendation on the stock.  The company is shielded from rising grain prices because
herds of cattle in Brazil and  Argentina  are primarily grass-fed,
while ranchers in the U.S. and  Canada  rely on corn and soybeans
for feedstock. Prices for corn climbed 12 percent and soybean
prices rose 5.8 percent in the quarter amid the worst U.S.
drought in more than half a century.  Net sales were 19.4 billion reais, up 24 percent from a
year ago. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization were 7.1 percent of sales in the quarter. That
compares with 5.1 percent a year earlier.  JBS said it has third-quarter free cash flow, or what is
left after covering operating expenses and capital spending, was
156.9 million reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
