Stocks with the highest dividends
are expensive enough that they may fall out of favor as an
increase in taxes on payouts looms, according to  David Bianco ,
Deutsche Bank AG’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the price-earnings ratio for
the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index exceeds the Dow Jones
Industrial Average’s P/E by 12 percent. The premium is close to
a peak of 13 percent, reached in October 2011.  Higher-dividend stocks are “stretched,” Bianco wrote in a
Nov. 9 report. The companies behind them pay out a relatively
high percentage of earnings and have less chance for profit
growth than others, he wrote.  Payouts made by companies in the Dow dividend index
amounted to 77 percent of third-quarter profit, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. For the Dow industrials, the figure
was 40 percent.  Utility and telephone stocks are vulnerable to increases in
dividend taxes, the New York-based strategist wrote. Shares of
some health-care companies and makers of food, beverages and
other consumer staples may also suffer.  The highest  tax rate  is set to climb to 43.4 percent in
January from 15 percent today. The potential surge stems from
plans to start taxing dividends as ordinary income and to have
the wealthiest Americans pay a 3.8 percent tax to help finance
expanded health-care coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
