South Africa trails Australia by one
run with six wickets in hand heading into the final session of
their series-opening cricket Test in Brisbane as the home team
maintained an outside chance of forcing the victory.  The touring team was 114-3, with the injured JP Duminy
unable to bat again, in its second innings at tea on day five.
Australia captain  Michael Clarke  earlier set a Gabba scoring
record of 259 not out before declaring at 565-5, a first-innings
lead of 115 runs.  James Pattinson then removed both openers and fellow fast
bowler Peter Siddle dismissed Hashim Amla, leaving Jacques Kallis 40 not out and AB de Villiers on 1 at the interval as
South Africa tries to avoid going 1-0 down in the three-match
series. A draw is the favored result, according to bookmakers.  Clarke’s score surpassed the previous Gabba Test record of
235 not out by England’s  Alastair Cook  two years ago. Mike Hussey became the third Australian batsman to hit a century in
the innings after opener  Ed Cowan  made his first Test hundred
yesterday.  Matthew Wade  finished 19 not out.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
