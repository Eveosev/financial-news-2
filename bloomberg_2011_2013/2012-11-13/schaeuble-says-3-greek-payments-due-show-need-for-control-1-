German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said that with aid payments to  Greece  from the last
three quarters due by year-end, euro-area governments need to
come up with an enhanced “control mechanism.”  “You’ll run up three tranches by the end of the year,”
Schaeuble told reporters today in Brussels, when asked if all
three would land in Greek coffers. “All the more important,
then, that we negotiate a suitable control mechanism. And that
is among the points for which we’ll be seeking a solution
together over the next few days.”  Schaeuble’s comments followed a Bild newspaper report that
the German government favors disbursing more than 44 billion
euros ($56 billion) of aid, including unpaid tranches scheduled
for the second and third quarters, in one installment.  The German finance minister didn’t specify the details of a
new mechanism, saying that the issue of such a component “is a
sensitive one in Greece.” He said he was confident ministers
will work out the details in coming days.  “It’s important for Greece, as well as for the  euro zone 
as a whole, that we focus on returning confidence -- and so for
that reason such considerations serve to strengthen
confidence,” Schaeuble told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
