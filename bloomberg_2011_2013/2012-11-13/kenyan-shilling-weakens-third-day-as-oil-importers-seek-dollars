Kenya ’s shilling slid for the third
day on increased dollar demand from oil importers and as the
 central bank  limited the amount of money it removed from the
market.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy retreated 0.2
percent to 85.63 a dollar, poised for the lowest level since
June 5, by 1:21 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital.  “There is increased demand for dollars largely from the
energy sector and we have seen the central bank accepting fewer
bids for its securities,” Julius Kiriinya, a trader
at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said by phone.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 7.5 billion shillings
($88 million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  out of bids of
31.69 billion shillings at a sale yesterday. The bank offered 2
billion shillings in repos today, an official who declined to be
identified in line with policy, said by phone. The central bank
has been offering repos to control  money supply  in the market.  Uganda’s shilling strengthened less than 0.1 percent to
2,601.5 a dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling weakened less
than 0.1 percent to 1,594 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
