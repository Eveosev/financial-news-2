Ethanol futures declined for a
second day in  Chicago  as corn and gasoline dropped on signs of
lower demand.  Prices for the biofuel followed the other commodities lower
as President  Barack Obama  prepared for talks with congressional
leaders to avert a $607 billion “fiscal cliff” in mandated
spending cuts and tax increases starting in January. They also
decreased as euro-area finance ministers put off until Nov. 20 a
decision on financing Greek debt.  “With energies trading the way they’re trading and corn
getting hammered, that’s pressuring ethanol,” said  Dan Flynn , a
trader at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “The economy isn’t
looking too sharp either.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 1.1 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.316 a gallon at 12:25 p.m. local time on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price since Nov. 5. Futures
have risen 5.1 percent this year.  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel narrowed to 32.86
cents a gallon from 34.93 cents yesterday, boosting the
biofuel’s luster for refiners to use more in an effort to pocket
the spread between the two. Gasoline traded at a premium of 99.8
cents a gallon to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28.  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast dropped 5
cents to $2.495 a gallon and in  New York  the additive decreased
3.5 cents to $2.435, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf fell 2 cents to $2.41 a gallon and
in Chicago the biofuel slipped 1 cent to $2.35.  Corn Decreases  Corn for December delivery slumped 7 cents, or 1 percent,
to $7.11 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. and blended with
gasoline to stretch supply and meet federal mandates.  Prices for the grain have fallen since a Nov. 9 U.S.
Department of Agriculture report forecast that farmers will
harvest 10.725 billion bushels of corn this year, up from an
October estimate of 10.71 billion, Flynn said.  About 42 percent of this year’s crop will be consumed by
ethanol, up from 40 percent last year, the USDA said in the
report.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 27 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
28 cents on yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be made
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Gasoline for December delivery fell 3.17 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.6446 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
