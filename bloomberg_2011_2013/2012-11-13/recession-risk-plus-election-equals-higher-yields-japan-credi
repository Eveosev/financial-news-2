Japan ’s worst economic contraction
since early 2011 will raise rather than lower benchmark bond
yields, primary dealers say, as politicians jostling for power
increase fiscal spending in the world’s largest debtor.  The  10-year rate , now at 0.735 percent and hovering above a
nine-year low, may climb to 0.875 percent by the end of March,
according to the median forecast compiled by  Bloomberg News  of
14 primary dealers obliged to bid at government auctions
including Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc. Similar-maturity
Treasury yields are projected to rise to 1.88 percent from 1.61
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The opposition  Liberal Democratic Party , whose support
exceeds Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s before elections that
may be held next month, is calling for more government stimulus
spending that could add to the nation’s 983 trillion yen ($12
trillion) in  debt , putting upward pressure on yields. Economists
expect Japan’s gross domestic product to shrink this quarter
after contracting in the previous three months, leading to the
third technical recession since 2008.  “A change in administration is likely to result in more
reflationary policies, including more public works that come
with increased issuance of bonds,” said Eiji Dohke, the chief
Japanese government bond strategist in  Tokyo  at Citigroup, who
expects the 10-year yield to rise to 1.1 percent. “I suppose 90
percent of people in markets think the LDP will become the
ruling party if elections are held.”  ‘Grim’ GDP  Japan’s GDP fell an annualized 3.5 percent last quarter,
the most since the earthquake and tsunami in early 2011, Cabinet
Office data showed yesterday in Tokyo. Exports to  Asia ,  Europe 
and the U.S. all slid, as did capital spending, according to the
government agency.  The GDP figures were “grim,” Noda said in parliament
yesterday. Economic output will probably shrink 0.4 percent in
the current three-month period, according to the median
projection of 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, meeting
the technical definition of recession of two-straight quarters
of contraction.  Forecasts for Japan’s 10-year bond yield in March ranged
from 0.5 percent to 1.1 percent, according to the survey
Bloomberg News conducted yesterday after the release of the GDP
data. Fourteen responses were collected from a total of 25
primary dealers.  Yields on the benchmark securities touched 0.72 percent on
July 23, the lowest since June 2003. The rate was 88 basis
points  less than  yields on similar maturity  U.S. Treasuries  on
Nov. 9, compared with 99 basis points a year earlier. One basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Morinaga Bonds  Elsewhere in Japan’s credit markets, Morinaga & Co. hired
banks for a 10 billion yen sale of five-year notes, according to
a statement yesterday from SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., which
will manage the deal with Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co. The offering will be the first by the Tokyo-based
confectionery maker since 1995, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Japan Expressway Holding & Debt Repayment Agency offered 30
billion yen of 1.944 percent, 30-year securities, SMBC Nikko
said in a statement.  The extra yield that investors demand to own Japanese
corporate bonds instead of sovereign debt has climbed 6 basis
points this month to 49 basis points as of yesterday, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The spread for
company notes worldwide has risen 3 to 157, the data show.  Exporter Earnings  The yen traded at 79.61 per dollar as of 9:23 a.m. in
Tokyo, 11 percent stronger than the five-year average and
compared with the all-time high of 75.35 reached a year earlier.
The currency’s strength is weighing on exporters’ earnings by
reducing repatriated profits and making their products more
expensive abroad.  Sharp Corp. and Panasonic Corp. expect to lose a combined
1.2 trillion yen in the fiscal year ending March, while Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co. and Nissan Motor Co. cut their full-
year profit forecasts and cosmetics company Shiseido Co. plans
to cut costs.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said yesterday
it’s necessary to watch whether the yen’s appreciation leads to
a decline in corporate profits and a deterioration in business
sentiment.  BOJ Stimulus  His BOJ board last month increased by 11 trillion yen to 66
trillion yen a fund that buys assets, including government and
corporate debt maturing in three years or shorter. Sovereign
notes with these maturities all yield around 0.1 percent.  “The BOJ may have to extend the maturity of the bonds it
buys to five years sometime in the first quarter next year,”
said Shogo Fujita, the chief Japanese bond strategist in Tokyo
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who expects 10-year yields to
fall to 0.65 percent by the end of March. “Once it happens,
five-year yields will fall toward 0.1 percent and 10-year rates
to below 0.7 percent.”  The economic slowdown threatens Noda’s plan to rein in
Japan’s public debt, which the International Monetary Fund
estimates will rise to to 250 percent of GDP in 2017 from 237
percent this year. Legislation passed in August to raise the
 sales tax  to 8 percent in April 2014 and to 10 percent in 2015
allows the increase to be canceled based on an assessment of
economic conditions.  “ Bond market  players may start to discount the probability
of a tax rise in 2014,” which could destabilize the Japanese
government bond market, said  Hiromichi Shirakawa , chief Japan
economist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Tokyo and a former BOJ
official.  Default Risk  The bond market has shown few signs so far of concern about
Japan’s fiscal health. The cost to insure the nation’s sovereign
bonds was at 68.1 basis points yesterday, after falling to 67.6
on Nov. 9, the least since Sept. 13, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The LDP advocates infrastructure investments to mitigate
the impacts of natural disasters, according to an  economic
revival plan  posted on its website. Its leader, former prime
minister Shinzo Abe, said the BOJ should continue monetary
easing until inflation rises to 3 percent, Reuters reported on
Nov. 7, citing remarks made by Abe to a gathering of business
executives. The BOJ’s goal is 1 percent inflation.  Japan’s  consumer prices  excluding fresh food fell 0.1
percent in September. They have never risen by more than 3
percent since 1991. The  GDP deflator , a measure of price changes
across the economy, fell 0.7 percent last quarter from the same
period of 2011, yesterday’s data showed.  Support Ratings  The LDP’s approval rating was 32 percent, double the ruling
 Democratic Party  of Japan’s 16 percent, a Nikkei newspaper poll
showed Oct. 29. Noda reached a deal with the opposition in
August to raise the nation’s sales tax rate in return for
promising to call elections “soon,” though he’s not legally
obligated to until next August.  Noda is planning to dissolve the lower house of parliament
by the end of this year and may hold elections as early as Dec.
16, the Nikkei reported today, without citing anyone.  “I expect reflationary policies to be introduced after a
possible change in administrations around the beginning of next
year, and that will lift stocks and bond yields,” said Hidenori Suezawa, Tokyo-based chief strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities,
who forecasts the 10-year yield will rise to 1 percent by the
end of March. “The reflationary policies are likely to include
more easing by the BOJ.”  Forecast Table *T
