Trinity Health System , a Catholic
health-care provider, received two credit pacts totaling $931
million.  U.S. Bancorp led the debt for the not-for-profit business,
based in Novi,  Michigan , according to a statement today
distributed by Business Wire.  Trinity, which operates acute-care hospitals, outpatient
and long-term care facilities and hospice programs in 10 states,
generates about $9 billion of “unrestricted” revenue,
according to the statement. It reinvests its profits back into
the community to serve the poor and uninsured, manage chronic
conditions and provide outreach to the elderly, according to the
statement said.  “We consulted closely with the system to create a
specialized solution for both their long and short term needs,”
Robert Joyce, senior vice president and business head of U.S.
Bank Healthcare, said in the statement.  U.S. Bank Healthcare  is a unit of Minneapolis-based U.S.
Bancorp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
