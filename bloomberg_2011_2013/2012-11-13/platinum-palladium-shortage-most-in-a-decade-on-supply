Platinum and palladium will return
to the biggest shortages in at least a decade this year as
strikes and safety stoppages in South Africa and falling sales
from Russia cut supplies,  Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT)  said.  Labor disputes in South Africa will help cut platinum
output to the least since 2000 and leave the market short by
400,000 ounces, the most since 2002 and compared with last
year’s surplus of 430,000 ounces, London-based Johnson Matthey
said today in a report. Palladium supply will lag demand by
915,000 ounces, the most since 2000 and compared with 2011’s
glut of 1.26 million ounces, on lower output from mines and
stockpiles in Russia and record usage from automakers.  Unrest over pay erupted into fighting and deaths at  Lonmin
Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana mine and spread to other operations this year in
South Africa, the largest platinum producer. Miners in  Russia 
are extracting less palladium from rock at a time when state
inventories are probably almost depleted, Johnson Matthey said.
Manufacturers are using more of the metal in pollution-control
devices as sales, particularly for gasoline models, increase.  “It’s unlikely that supplies of either platinum or
palladium are going to rise,” Jonathan Butler, publications
manager at Johnson Matthey, said in an interview in London.
“We’re assuming that demand is going to remain robust for both
metals. Overall, we’re positive on investment demand, that
conditions will remain favorable.”  Platinum Price  Platinum traded at $1,582.25 an ounce by 2:11 p.m. in
London for a 13 percent advance this year. It will average
$1,625 in the next six months, trading between $1,400 and
$1,800, Johnson Matthey said. Palladium, at $616.50 an ounce,
will average $650 in the period, remaining above $550 and
climbing as high as $750. It’s fallen 5.9 percent in 2012.  The metals’ performance this year compares with a 2.2
percent decline for the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
commodities and a 7.4 percent advance for the MSCI All-Country
World Index of equities. Treasuries returned 2.7 percent this
year, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Platinum supply will drop 9.9 percent to 5.84 million
ounces on a 12 percent slide in  South Africa , which will account
for 73 percent of global output, according to the report. In
May, the company had forecast a surplus this year. Palladium
supply is expected to drop 11 percent to 6.57 million ounces as
mine output slips 6.3 percent in South Africa and 3.9 percent in
Russia, the biggest producer of the metal.  Russian Stockpiles  Palladium sales from Russian inventories, a state secret,
will slip 68 percent to 250,000 ounces this year and will
account for most of the remaining reserves, Johnson Matthey
said. Recycling, adding to supply, will fall 11 percent to 1.83
million ounces of platinum this year and slip 4.5 percent to
2.24 million ounces of palladium, the company forecast.  “Assuming we do see sustained higher prices during 2013,
we could well see an uptick in recycling as metal that’s been
held onto this year comes back to the market,” Butler said.  There may be 200,000 to 300,000 ounces of platinum and the
same amount of palladium in stockpiles from old autocatalysts,
Lucy Bloxham, a senior market analyst at Johnson Matthey, said
in a presentation in  London  today. That metal would eventually
come back to the market through recycling, she said.  A 9.9 percent jump in platinum jewelry usage and purchases
through exchange-traded products will cut the drop in overall
demand this year to 0.3 percent, the report showed. The amount
used in engine-based machinery not designed for roads will total
130,000 ounces, Johnson Matthey said. Traditional autocatalyst
consumption will fall 1.1 percent to 3.07 million ounces of
platinum as declines in Europe outweigh gains in  China ,  Japan 
and other emerging nations, the report showed.  Pollution Control  The canisters have honeycomb-like surfaces converting
emissions into less harmful substances. Carmakers typically use
more palladium for gasoline engines and more platinum for diesel
types. They’ll raise the amount of palladium used in the devices
this year by 7.5 percent to a record 6.48 million ounces, said
Johnson Matthey, the maker of one in three autocatalysts.  “For palladium, we see some further growth in autocatalyst
demand,” Butler said. “Technology changes next year driven by
environmental legislation are expected to result in some
additional demand for platinum in  Europe , despite the weakness
in the European car market.”  Electrical demand for palladium will slide 12 percent to
1.21 million ounces and jewelry buying will drop 11 percent to
450,000 ounces, the researcher said. Investors will add 385,000
ounces this year, compared with sales of 565,000 ounces in 2011.
Platinum investment will rise 30,000 ounces to 490,000 ounces.  Rhodium Shortage  Rhodium will move to a 43,000-ounce shortage, the most
since 2005, from last year’s 139,000-ounce glut, on lower supply
from South Africa and more demand from vehicle manufacturers,
Johnson Matthey said. The commodity is mainly used in catalytic
converters and also in the chemical and glass industries. It’s
down 18 percent this year at $1,150 an ounce, according to
Johnson Matthey  prices  on Bloomberg.  Ruthenium consumption will slip 20 percent to a three-year
low of 770,000 ounces as chemical purchases slow. It’s mostly
used for coating computer hard disks. Demand for iridium, used
in spark plugs and for growing metal oxide crystals, will slump
35 percent to a three-year low of 218,000 ounces, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
