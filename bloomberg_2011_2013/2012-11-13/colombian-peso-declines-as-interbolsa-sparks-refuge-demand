Colombia ’s peso fell to a one-week
low as investors bought dollars as a refuge from turmoil after
the collapse of the Andean nation’s biggest brokerage.  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 1,817.40 per  U.S. dollar .
Earlier it touched 1,823.15, the weakest level since Nov. 6. It
has advanced 5.2 percent in the past year, the best performance
among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said Nov. 7 that
regulators will liquidate Interbolsa SA’s brokerage after it
failed to meet a loan payment. Following the collapse,
Colombia’s central bank began offering 300 billion pesos ($165
million) of 14-day  repurchase agreements  to boost liquidity,
accepting securities including corporate bonds as collateral.  “People are still nervous after what happened with
Interbolsa so we’re still seeing low trading volume and some
seeking refuge in the dollar,” said Cesar Corredor, an analyst
at Banco de Bogota SA, the nation’s second-biggest bank. “The
measures taken by the government have helped calm fears.”  The benchmark Colcap stock index has dropped 3.7 percent
this month, after Interbolsa said Nov. 1 it was facing a funding
squeeze.  Today investors took 1.86 billion pesos of the 14-day repos
offered by the central bank. There were no trades of the
country’s benchmark peso bonds due July 2024 on the central
bank’s platform known as SEN.  The yield on the government’s 11.25 percent peso-
denominated debt due in October 2018 rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 5.64 percent, according to the central
bank. The price fell 0.337 centavo to 127.669 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
