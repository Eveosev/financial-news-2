Poland’s proposals to increase taxes
on oil and gas will result in reduced exploration, the Polish
Exploration and Production Industry Organization said.  The nation’s plans will limit scope for joint ventures and
don’t take into account the level of investment needed,
according to Marcin Zieba, general director of the group that
represents  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  and PKN Orlen SA.  Poland’s government proposed new levies last month on
hydrocarbon production totaling about 40 percent of profit
starting in 2015. Plans include a charge of 5 percent of the
value of extracted natural gas and 10 percent of oil plus taxes
on profits of 25 percent and fees to the regional authorities.  “Proposed levies in addition to corporate income tax will
substantially exceed the 40 percent declared by the government
and may slow and curb exploration,” Zieba said in an e-mail
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
