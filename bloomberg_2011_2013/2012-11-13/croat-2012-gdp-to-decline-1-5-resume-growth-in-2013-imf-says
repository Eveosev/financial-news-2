Croatia’s economy will contract more
than expected this year before returning to growth in 2013 as
external conditions and subdued domestic demand slow the
recovery from a recession, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  Gross domestic product will shrink 1.5 percent in 2012, the
Washington-based lender said in a statement today following a
visit to the Adriatic Sea nation. The estimate is revised from a
February forecast for a 1 percent contraction. GDP next year
will expand 0.75 percent, it added.  “Sustained recovery from the economic crisis in 2009
remains elusive,” the IMF said in the statement. “Further on,
barriers to investment and employment growth, if not forcefully
addressed, will keep potential growth modest.”  Croatia, which is set to become the EU’s 28th member in
July 2013, stands to receive about 10 billion euros ($12.7
billion) in EU grants through 2020. The country is struggling to
revive the economy and boost investment after three years of
recession and stagnation.  The 10-month-old government of Premier Zoran Milanovic has
vowed to reduce public sector spending remove obstacles to
investment to speed up the sale of state companies.  The IMF “welcomed the recent adoption of the government’s
structural reform program, which makes a good start on the road
to restore competitiveness and spur growth,” the report said.
“Strengthening EU funds absorption capacity would allow  Croatia 
to take full advantage of EU accession by supporting growth-
enhancing investments.”  The  government  estimated the economy will stagnate this
year, while the European Commission said on Nov. 7 it will
shrink 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
