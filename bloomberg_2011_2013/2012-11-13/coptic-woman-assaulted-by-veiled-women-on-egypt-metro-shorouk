An Egyptian Coptic woman was
assaulted, had her hair cut off and was tossed from a Cairo
metro by two women wearing the Islamic niqab, in the third such
incident in a week, the independent Al-Shorouk reported today.  The woman told authorities one of the women grabbed her by
the arm shortly after she boarded the train while another pulled
a pair of scissors from her purse and cut off some of her hair,
the newspaper reported. The assailants, who were wearing the
full face veil favored by ultraconservatives, then pushed her
from the train when it pulled to a stop.  Authorities have stationed women on the train carriages
reserved for female passengers to monitor against such
incidents, the newspaper reported, citing an unidentified
security official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
