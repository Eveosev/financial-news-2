Asian  stocks  fell to a two-month low
led by banking shares and developers after Australia’s business
confidence deteriorated and on a report China may expand a
property tax trial.  Westpac Banking Corp. dropped 2.2 percent in Sydney.  QBE
Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE)  sank 7.5 percent as analysts cut ratings
for Australia’s biggest insurer after it lowered its profit
forecast.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813)  fell 2.3 percent to lead
Chinese developers lower in Hong Kong. Petrochina Co. slid 1.2
percent as  oil prices  declined.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slipped 0.6 percent to 120.12
as of 3:11 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge has fallen about 2 percent
this quarter as companies from Honda Motor Co. to QBE cut
forecasts even as data showed China’s economic slump may be
bottoming.  “Markets are priced in for very low growth and there’s
still quite a lot of pessimism around,” said Nader Naeimi,
Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which manages almost $100 billion. “You see the
lack of conviction and skepticism in low volumes. This shows
investors' worry, anxiety and skepticism to participate in the
market.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific gained 11 percent through yesterday
from this year’s low on June 4 as central banks added stimulus
to spur growth and data showed a slowdown in China may be
ending. Markets in Malaysia and Singapore are closed today for a
holiday.  Relative Value  The Asia-Pacific gauge traded at 13.2 times estimated
earnings as of Nov. 9, compared with 13.3 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  retreated 0.3 percent
today, erasing an earlier gain of 0.5 percent as the yen
strengthened. Volume was 22 percent less than the 30-day
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.8 percent amid a sell-
off in Chinese shares listed in the city. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  lost 1.4 percent. The gauge, Asia’s best
performing major gauge this quarter through Nov. 9, has fallen
5.3 percent since entering a so-called  bull market  on Nov. 2
after rising more than 20 percent from its low for the year.
South Korea’s Kospi slid 0.6 percent today.  Australian Confidence  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  lost 1.5 percent after a
report showed the countrys’ business confidence weakened. The
confidence index slipped to minus 1 from zero in September, a
National Australia Bank Ltd. survey of more than 400 companies
taken Oct. 18-31 and released in Sydney today showed. The
business conditions gauge, a measure of hiring, sales and
profits, dropped to minus 5 from minus 3.  Westpac Banking dropped 2.2 percent to A$24.80. National
Australia Bank Ltd. declined 2.2 percent to $23.11, while
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  and Commonwealth Bank
of Australia fell more than 1.1 percent.  China is “actively” studying expanding a property tax
trial at an “appropriate” time, the Xinhua News Agency cited
Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Jiang Weixin as
saying yesterday. The government won’t relax restrictions on
home purchases in the short term, he said, according to the
report.  Shimao Property lost 2.3 percent to HK$14.30.  China
Resources Land Ltd. (1109)  declined 0.9 percent to HK$18.16.  Energy shares accounted for the largest drop of 10 industry
groups on the Asian equity gauge amid signs supplies are rising
in the U.S. and China, the world’s biggest crude consumers.  Petrochina dropped 1.2 percent to HK$10.22 and Cnooc Ltd.
slipped 0.8 percent to HK$15.84.  Hitachi Metals Ltd. (5486)  lost 8.2 percent to 624 yen after the
Nikkei newspaper reported it may merge with electronic-equipment
manufacturer Hitachi Cable Ltd., which surged 19 percent to 127
yen. The cable unit of Hitachi Ltd. hasn’t made a profit in four
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
