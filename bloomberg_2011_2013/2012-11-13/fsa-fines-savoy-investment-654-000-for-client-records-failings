The U.K.  Financial Services
Authority   fined Savoy Investment Management Ltd. 412,000 pounds
($655,000) for failing to ensure the suitability of the
investment portfolios of its wealth-management clients.  Savoy failed to keep adequate records of clients’ finances,
leading to a risk that investment managers were making decisions
“that did not match clients’ expectations and their attitude to
risk,” the London-based regulator said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “It is critical that wealth management firms properly
identify and record client needs and monitor the suitability of
their advice and discretionary management services,” Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime at the
FSA, said in the statement.  The FSA carried out a review of conflicts of interest at
asset management firms between June 2011 and February this year
and said it would select some firms for follow up visits. The
regulator said it observed poor practices including the favoring
of certain customers over others, failing to report trading
errors and inconsistent policies regarding the personal trading
accounts of fund managers.  “This is clearly a significant fine but we have chosen to
accept the FSA’s findings and agree an early settlement with
them to allow our business to move forward,” Jonathan Polin,
chief executive officer of Savoy’s parent company,  Ashcourt
Rowan (ARP)  Plc, said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
