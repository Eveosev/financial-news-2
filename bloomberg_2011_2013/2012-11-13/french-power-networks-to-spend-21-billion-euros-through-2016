     Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- France ’s electricity transport and
distribution grids plan to spend 21 billion euros ($27 billion)
in the next four years on improving and expanding networks,
potentially pushing up power prices, according to the regulator.  Reseau de Transport d’Electricite , Electricite de France
SA’s wholly owned  power grid , plans to invest 6.59 billion euros
through 2016 on connecting new power sources and reinforcing
connections with neighboring countries, the Commission de
Regulation de l’Energie said in a statement today. ERDF, the
utility’s distribution arm, has projected 14.13 billion euros of
spending in the same period.  The investment plans are contained in the regulator’s
evaluation of tariff increases required by the network operators
to operate and maintain infrastructure. The regulator rules on
power price modifications in France.  RTE would require a 5.2 percent increase in its user
tariffs Aug. 1 to be followed by 3 percent annual increases
through 2016, according to the document. ERDF has projected its
own rate increases of 2.4 percent annually through 2016.  EDF, the world’s largest operator of nuclear reactors, has
increasingly relied on electricity from abroad to meet demand
during peak periods like the cold winter months. The utility is
developing a new EPR atomic reactor at Flamanville in Normandy
for which RTE is building new high-tension cables. These are
also being added to a link between France and  Spain  to boost
power trading between those countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
