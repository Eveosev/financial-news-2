Fonciere des Murs SCA  and two French
banks’ insurance units bought 165 hotels in  France  from  Carlyle
Group LP (CG) ’s B&B Hotels for 508 million euros ($644 million).  Fonciere des Murs, the sale-and-leaseback company
controlled by Fonciere des Regions SA, will own 50.2 percent of
a tax-exempt fund buying the budget hotels from B&B, according
to an e-mailed statement today.  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ’s Assurances
unit will have a 40 percent stake and Assurances du Credit
Mutuel, a unit of Banque Federative du Credit Mutuel SA, will
own 9.8 percent.  B&B, acquired by Washington-based Carlyle  in 2010 , will
lease back the properties. The rental income represents about
6.9 percent of the purchase price, according to the statement.
Fonciere des Murs, based in Paris, acquired 18 hotels from B&B
in October 2010.  “This new transaction will enable  Fonciere des Murs (FMU)  to
position itself as the preferred contact for B&B,” according to
the statement.  Fonciere des Murs already owned 171 hotels or spas, mainly
operated by Accor SA, which were valued at 1.57 billion euros at
the end of June. Its other assets include retirement homes,
clinics, garden centers and holiday villages.  Fonciere des Murs  was unchanged at 17.20 euros at 11:07
a.m. in Paris, valuing the company at 1.1 billion euros. The
shares have gained about 2.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
