Serbia ’s  inflation rate  surged to
the highest level in  Europe  last month as food costs rose after
a poor harvest in the Balkan nation.  The rate climbed to 12.9 percent from a year earlier, the
highest since April 2011, following a 10.3 percent increase in
September, the Serbian statistics office in Belgrade said on its
website today. Consumer prices advanced 2.8 percent from a month
earlier.  Serbia’s price surge is a “combination of earlier
exchange-rate weakness, a poor harvest, tax increases and a rise
in utility bills as part of the government’s fiscal
consolidation,” Timothy Ash, an economist at Standard Chartered
Plc in  London , said in a note. Austerity efforts and “broader
deflation as the  economy  shrinks before recovering next year
should begin to slow inflation,” he said.  Serbia’s central bank unexpectedly raised its benchmark
 interest rate  0.2 percentage point last week to tame price
growth, even as the economy fell into its second recession in
three years. Gross domestic product has declined for three
quarters, dropping 2.2 percent in the three months through
September from a year earlier, according to preliminary data.  The Serbian dinar has lost 4 percent of against the euro
this year, Europe’s worst-performing currency after the Romanian
leu, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Balkan nation today sold 38.5 million euros ($49
million) in 18-month Treasury bills at an average yield of 5.85
percent, the Serbian debt management agency said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
