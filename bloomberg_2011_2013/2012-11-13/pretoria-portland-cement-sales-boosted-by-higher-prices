Pretoria Portland Cement Ltd. (PPC) , the
largest cement maker in  South Africa , said full-year sales rose
8 percent as higher selling prices offset lower volumes caused
in part by strikes and slowing economic growth.  Net income attributable to shareholders decreased 2 percent
to 768 million rand ($88 million) in the 12 months through
September, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement.
Revenue rose 8 percent to 7.3 billion rand, it said. Earnings
per share, excluding one-off accounting items, climbed 11
percent to 1.85 rand.  PPC is focusing on expansion outside South Africa to boost
profit in the face of slowing economic growth in the continent’s
biggest economy. The company agreed in July to buy about half of
 Ethiopia ’s Habesha Cement Share Co. alongside The Industrial
Development Corp.  “The first phase of our Habesha investment in Ethiopia
will increase our revenue outside South Africa from the current
21 percent to approximately 26 percent within the next three
years,” the company said.  Labor unrest in the mining sector and a truck driver strike
will lead to “more subdued numbers” for the rest of 2012, PPC
said. The worst labor protests since the end of apartheid have
led to stoppages at South Africa’s platinum, coal,  iron ore  and
coal mines, while 20,000 truck drivers went on a 2 1/2 week
strike on Sept. 24.  PPC said it had raised its full-year dividend payment by 12
percent to 1.46 rand per share. The shares have risen about 3
percent in the year to date, compared with a 17 percent rise in
the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
