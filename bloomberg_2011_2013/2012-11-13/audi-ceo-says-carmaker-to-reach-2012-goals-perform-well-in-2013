Audi AG (NSU) , the world’s second-largest
maker of luxury cars, said it’s on track to reach a goal of
selling a record 1.4 million vehicles in 2012 and expects the
momentum to continue into next year.  “We are successfully performing against the European
trend,” Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler told journalists
at the manufacturer’s headquarters in Ingolstadt,  Germany . “We
expect Audi to perform well 2013.”  Luxury automakers such as market leader  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW)  and Audi have used price cuts to maintain sales and
counter a market slowdown, hurting profitability. Nine-month
operating profit at Audi, a unit of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , narrowed to
11.1 percent of sales from 12.1 percent a year earlier, while
deliveries jumped 8.8 percent.  Audi plans to start building a factory in San Jose Chiapa,
 Mexico , in 2013 as it follows the strategy of German competitors
BMW and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz unit in adding production
outside their home market.  Until three years ago, Audi produced 75 percent of its
vehicles in the German cities of Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm,
focusing largely on increasing quality and expanding its model
lineup to include the A1 subcompact, A7 four-door luxury coupe
and Q5 sport-utility vehicle. Growth was supported by using
spare capacity at a former VW facility in  Belgium  and a factory
owned by Volkswagen’s Spanish brand SEAT.  BMW and Mercedes, in contrast, have long-established
factories in South Africa, the U.S. and China.  International Target  By 2017, the share of Audi’s domestic manufacturing is
projected to fall to 45 percent while annual production doubles
to 1.9 million vehicles, largely at new sites in  China  and
Mexico and an expanded facility in  Hungary .  The San Jose Chiapa plant, scheduled to begin operating in
2016, will have capacity to make 150,000 vehicles a year. It
will be located about 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of Puebla,
Mexico, where Volkswagen builds the Jetta and Beetle cars for
North American buyers. The Audi site will manufacture the Q5.  The site can be expanded to produce other Audi SUVs,
Stadler said at an event late yesterday, adding that there
currently are no concrete plans to do so.  Audi sells about half as many cars in the U.S. as Munich-
based BMW and Stuttgart-based Mercedes, and it has a target of
increasing deliveries in the country by 59 percent from last
year to 200,000 vehicles by 2018. Audi’s global 10-month car and
SUV sales rose 13 percent to 1.2 million vehicles. That compares
with with an 11 percent increase at VW’s namesake brand to 4.72
million units.  A 900 million-euro ($1.14 billion) expansion of Audi’s
plant in Gyor, Hungary, will triple annual capacity to 125,000
cars as of 2013.  Next year will also mark the start of production of a
variant of Audi’s A3 compact at a new factory in Foshan, China,
part of VW’s joint venture with China FAW Group Corp. The plant,
Audi’s second in the country, will boost Audi’s annual capacity
there by 40 percent to 700,000 vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
