Nigeria’s Lagos state, home to the
country’s commercial capital and sub-Saharan  Africa ’s biggest
city, started a process to gauge investor interest in its
proposed seven-year 80 billion-naira ($507 million) bond sale.  Coupon guidance has been given at 12.75 percent to 14
percent with order requests closing on Nov. 19, Jude Chiemeka,
chief executive officer of Lagos-based Chapel Hill Denham
Securities Ltd., the sale’s lead book-runner, said by phone
today. The proposed size of the issue may change once the book-
building process has been completed, according to a term sheet
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The proceeds from the sale would be used to fund
infrastructure projects including an urban rail line to help
ease traffic congestion in Lagos, Governor Babatunde Fashola,
said in an Oct. 27 interview. Lagos state first issued debt in
2008, when it sold 50 billion naira of five-year securities with
a 13 percent coupon. It concluded a 50 billion-naira, seven-year
bond sale in April 2010 at a 10 percent coupon, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The planned sale comes after borrowing costs for Nigeria’s
federal government dropped after JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced
in August that it will add the country’s bonds to its GBI-EM
index series from Oct.1. The yield on the 16.39 percent federal
government naira debt due 2022 has dropped 339 basis points to
12.74 percent since the start of August, according to data
compiled by the Lagos-based Financial Markets Dealers
Association.  Though the smallest in land area of  Nigeria ’s 36 states,
Lagos is the most densely populated, with about 22 million
people living in the metropolitan hub, up from about 17 million
in 2006, according to the state government. The regional
government is investing in infrastructure to meet the needs of a
population it estimates is increasing at 3 percent a year.  Projects to ease the city’s traffic congestion include the
rail system, which needs a further $1 billion in financing. That
project has stalled due to a shortfall in state funds, according
to Fashola.  To contact the reporter on this story:
