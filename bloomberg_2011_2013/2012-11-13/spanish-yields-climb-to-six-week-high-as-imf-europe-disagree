Spanish 10-year bonds rose, pushing
down yields from the highest in more than six weeks, after
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  signaled Greek aid
payments may be bundled into a single installment.  Germany’s 10-year bonds erased a gain after Bild-Zeitung
earlier reported that the nation favored giving  Greece  a one-off
disbursement of 44 billion euros ($55.8 billion). European
policy makers extended by two years the Mediterranean country’s
deadline to reduce its  budget deficit , though they didn’t say
how the additional funding needs would be covered. The yields on
Austrian and Belgian securities slid to records and French bonds
climbed for a ninth day, the longest winning streak since 1997.  “The headlines on Schaeuble” have boosted Spanish and
Italian bonds, said  Marc Ostwald , a rates strategist at Monument
Securities Ltd. in  London . “He’s saying all that is left to
discuss is process rather than principal. That gives markets a
bit of reassurance.”  Spain ’s 10-year yields dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.85 percent at 5 p.m. London time, after
climbing to 5.96 percent, the highest since Oct. 1. The 5.85
percent bond due January 2022 fell 0.275, or 2.75 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 99.975. The rate on similar-maturity
Italian bonds dropped six basis points to 4.96 percent.  Greek Payments  Germany plans to bundle aid payments to Greece, Bild-
Zeitung reported, citing government sources it didn’t identify.
The disbursement would consist of 31.3 billion euros from a
second-quarter aid plan that hasn’t been paid out yet, 5 billion
euros from funds earmarked for the third-quarter and 8.3 billion
from the fourth-quarter, the newspaper reported.  European policy makers granted Greece until 2016 to cut the
nation’s deficit to 2 percent of gross domestic product, putting
off until Nov. 20 a decision on how to cover additional Greek
requirements of as much as 32.6 billion euros.  International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine
Lagarde  took issue with a decision by the euro chiefs to
postpone the goal of getting Greece’s debt down to 120 percent
of gross domestic product until 2022, saying the creditors had
“different views.”  Greek bonds advanced as the nation auctioned 4.06 billion
euros of 28- and 91-day bills. The yield on Greece’s 2 percent
security due February 2023 fell eight basis points to 17.80
percent, leaving the price at 31.225 percent of face value.  German Bunds  Germany’s 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.34
percent, after dropping to 1.31 percent, matching the lowest
since Aug. 31.  Two-year notes yielded minus 0.033 percent. The rate
dropped to minus 0.055 percent on Nov. 7, the least since Aug.
13. A negative yield means investors who hold the security until
it matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations in  Germany 
dropped to minus 15.7 from minus 11.5 in October. Economists had
forecast an increase to minus 10, according to the median of 43
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Austria ’s 10-year rate fell as much as five basis points to
1.74 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg started collecting the
data in 1993, while the yield on similar-maturity Belgian
securities slipped to 2.232 percent, also the least since 1993.  French Gains  French 10-year bonds rose for a ninth day, the longest run
of gains since the period ended Feb. 14, 1997, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on the securities tumbled as
much as six basis points to 2.047 percent, approaching the
record 2.002 percent reached on Aug. 3.  Volatility on French bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by those of Austria, according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  Dutch bonds rose, with the 10-year yield dropping one basis
point to 1.60 percent, after the Netherlands sold 2.12 billion
euros of securities due in 2022 at a  record-low  auction yield of
1.579 percent.  German bonds returned 4.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities gained 2.1 percent and Italian debt earned 17
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
