Michael Clarke hit an unbeaten 259
before declaring  Australia ’s first-innings at 565-5 in reply to
South Africa’s 450 in their opening cricket Test in Brisbane.  Clarke called a halt to the innings during the first drinks
break on the final day with the home team 115 runs ahead. Mike Hussey earlier became the third Australian batsman to score a
century after opener  Ed Cowan  make his first Test hundred
yesterday. Matthew Wade was 19 not out.  There are about five hours of play remaining on the final
day of the first of three matches between the teams that will
decide the No. 1 Test ranking. A draw in Brisbane is the favored
result, according to bookmakers.  Clarke’s score was the highest individual total in all Test
matches at the Gabba, beating the 235 not out by  England ’s
Alastair Cook two years ago. Hussey made 100.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
