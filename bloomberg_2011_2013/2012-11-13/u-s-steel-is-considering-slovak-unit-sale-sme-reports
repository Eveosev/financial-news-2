U.S. Steel Corp. is considering
selling its Slovak unit, Sme newspaper reported, citing trade-
union leader Mikulas Hintos.  The steelmaker is in the “early” stage of talks with
undisclosed potential bidders for its U.S. Steel Kosice unit,
the newspaper cited Hintos as saying.  The unit based in Kosice, eastern Slovakia, posted a 2
million-euro ($2.5 million) loss last year and will need to
invest about half a billion dollars to meet the European Union’s
environmental regulations, Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
