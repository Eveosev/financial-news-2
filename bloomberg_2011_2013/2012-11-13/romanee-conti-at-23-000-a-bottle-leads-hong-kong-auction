Acker Merrall & Condit said it sold
HK$46.8 million ($6 million) of wine at its two-day  Hong Kong 
auction ended Nov. 10, as buyers bid aggressively on top
Burgundies.  The highlight of the sale was a three-bottle lot of
Romanee-Conti Domaine de la Romanee-Conti 2005, which fetched
HK$541,000 ($69,827) or $23,275 per bottle, Acker said in a
press release.  Domaine de la Romanee-Conti wine accounted for nine of the
top 10 lots, Acker said.  The next major Hong Kong wine sale will be held by  Zachys 
on Nov. 16 - 17 at the Mandarin Oriental hotel.  (Frederik Balfour is a reporter-at-large for Muse, the arts
