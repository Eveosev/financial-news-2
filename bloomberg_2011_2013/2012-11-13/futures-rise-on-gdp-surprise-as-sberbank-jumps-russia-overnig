Russian  equity futures  rose as data
showing the nation’s economy expanded more than analysts
predicted in the third quarter boosted the appeal of the
cheapest stocks among the biggest  emerging markets .  Futures expiring in December on Moscow’s RTS Index added
0.2 percent to 140,050 in New York, and the  Bloomberg Russia-US
Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S.
climbed for the first time in four days.  OAO Rostelecom (ROSYY)  led
gains on the gauge, while American depositary receipts of  OAO
Sberbank (SBRCY) , Russia’s largest lender, rose for a second day on
trading volumes triple their three-month average.  Gross domestic product  in Russia grew 2.9 percent last
quarter, the statistics service said yesterday, beating the 2.8
percent median estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg  survey 
and the  Economy Ministry ’s own forecast set last month. The
benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  traded for 5.41 times  estimated company
earnings , up from a two-month low of 5.39 times reached on Nov.
9. That compares with a multiple of 13.8 for the main index in
 India (SENSEX) , 10.7 for  Brazil  and  China ’s 8.8.  “Russia’s economy didn’t slow as much as was expected and
there are no threats comparable to those that the U.S. and
European economies are facing,” Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief
economist at brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp., said by phone
from Moscow yesterday. “Russian equities are cheap and
therefore attractive at these levels, especially when you put
the prices into the context of economic growth.”  Drought Impact  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 0.7 percent to $27.31 in New
York.  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
futures, slipped 0.2 percent to 27.12 points.  Open interest  on
puts to sell RTS futures expiring in December fell yesterday,
after reaching a record 865,576 contracts on Nov. 8, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Russia ’s economy expanded in the third quarter at the
slowest pace since its recovery began at the start of 2010 as
droughts ravaged crops and slowing growth in China and a slump
in Europe curbed demand for shipments of oil, natural gas and
metals.  The 30-stock Micex climbed 0.5 percent to 1,407.90 in
Moscow yesterday, while the ruble was little changed at 31.6101
per dollar. Futures on the ruble were steady at 31.819 versus
the greenback yesterday in New York.  Sberbank ADRs gained 0.5 percent to $10.99 in the U.S. One
ADR equals four ordinary shares. The  stock  rose 1.2 percent to
86.80 rubles, or $2.74, in Moscow yesterday, where volumes were
about 60 percent of the average over the past three months.  MegaFon Resumption  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s biggest mobile phone
company by subscribers, rose 1.8 percent to $16.97 in New York,
settling at a 17.2 percent premium versus its Moscow-listed
stock, the biggest gap since Oct. 22. The shares fell 0.3
percent to 229.04 rubles, or $7.23 on the Micex. One ADR is
equal to two shares.  Rostelecom, a state-run telecommunications operator,
advanced 2.1 percent to $22.62. The Moscow-based company’s  stock 
in Moscow increased 1.6 percent to 119.33 rubles. One ADR is
equal six shares.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , world’s sixth biggest mobile
phone company by subscribers, dropped 0.3 percent to $10.67 in
New York, the lowest level since Sept. 4.  OAO MegaFon (MFON) , Russia’s second-largest mobile-phone company
by customers, plans to resume its initial public offering as
early as this week, according to people with knowledge of the
matter who declined to be identified as the matter is
confidential. MegaFon, which is planning a dual listing in
London and Moscow, is valued at as much as $11 billion by
investors, people familiar with the matter said last month.  Crude Falls  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , which owns Russia’s CTC television channel
and is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, climbed 1.8 percent
to $8.50, gaining for the first time in four days in New York
yesterday. The Moscow-based company forged a deal with Walt
Disney Co. to screen movies and cartoons on its channel in the
former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, according to a statement
yesterday.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, dropped in New York
yesterday, falling for the first time in three days as European
policy makers met to discuss aid for  Greece  and a report showed
 Japan ’s economy shrank.  Crude oil for December delivery declined 0.6 percent to
$85.57 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent
oil for December settlement declined 0.3 percent to $109.07 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. Urals
