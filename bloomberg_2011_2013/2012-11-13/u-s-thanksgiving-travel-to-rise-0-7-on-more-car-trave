U.S. travel during the Thanksgiving
holiday weekend will rise a fourth straight year, gaining 0.7
percent from 2011, as trips by automobile rise even as airplane
trips decline, AAA said today.  About 43.6 million people will journey 50 miles or more
from home this year, up from 43.3 million last year, the
nation’s biggest motoring organization said in a statement. The
increase would be the smallest since 2009, AAA said.  “Thanksgiving travel hit a decade low in 2008 when only
37.8 million Americans traveled,” Robert Darbelnet, chief
executive officer at AAA, said in the statement. “Since that
year, we have seen a steady increase in the number of travelers
taking to the roads and skies for the holiday.”  Automobile transportation will account for 39.1 million of
the holiday travelers, an increase of 0.6 percent from last
year. The number of air passengers will decline 1.9 percent to
3.14 million, according to the report.  Americans will spend less and travel fewer miles during the
2012 holiday period, which runs from Nov. 21 to Nov. 25 with
Thanksgiving falling on Nov. 22. Trip plans by residents in the
Central Atlantic states may be curtailed because of  Hurricane
Sandy ’s Oct. 29 landfall, AAA said.  “While we do not yet know the full impact that Hurricane
Sandy will have on travel from the mid-Atlantic region, we do
know that the impact for many Americans in that region is
substantial,” Darbelnet said.  Travel Spending  Americans will spend approximately $498 per household to
travel during the holiday period, compared with $554 last year.
The average distance journeyed will decline to 588 miles from
706 miles in 2011, because of the decrease in air travelers and
Americans’ desire to be more frugal, AAA said.  The  average price  of a gallon of self-serve gasoline will
be between $3.25 and $3.40 a gallon over the holiday period,
according to AAA. Last year’s average of $3.32 was the highest
on record.  AAA’s projections are based on research by IHS Global
Insight of Englewood,  Colorado .  To contact the reporter on this story:
