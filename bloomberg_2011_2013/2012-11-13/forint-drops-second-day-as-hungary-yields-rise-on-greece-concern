The forint weakened for a second day
and Hungarian bond yields rose as concern  Greece ’s debt crisis
will escalate hurt demand for riskier assets.  Hungary’s currency depreciated as much as 0.5 percent and
traded 0.3 percent weaker at 284.83 per euro by 4:48 p.m. in
Budapest. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.92
percent.  While the U.S. faces a fiscal cliff of spending cuts and
tax increases unless lawmakers act, European governments put off
until next week a decision on how to cover additional Greek
funding needs, while giving the country two extra years to
wrestle down its budget deficit. Hungary, the European Union’s
most indebted eastern member, has failed to obtain aid from the
 International Monetary Fund  and the EU for almost a year amid
disputes on measures taken to cut the  budget deficit .  “All the noise surrounding Greece and the fiscal cliff in
the U.S. has put at least a temporary end to market
complacency,” Vienna-based Erste Group Bank AG wrote in an e-
mailed report today. “The bad boy in central eastern  Europe ,
Hungary, is taking the brunt of the selling pressure in the
foreign exchange market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
