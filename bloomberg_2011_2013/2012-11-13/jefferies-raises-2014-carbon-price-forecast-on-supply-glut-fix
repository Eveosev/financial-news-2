Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  boosted its
forecast for European Union carbon permit prices in 2014 by 11
percent after the regulator proposed yesterday to temporarily
cut supply in the three years through 2015.  Carbon may rise to about 12 euros ($15.23) a metric ton by
that year, compared with an earlier forecast of 10.80 euros a
ton,  Matthew Gray , an analyst and trader at Jefferies in London,
said today by e-mail.  The European Commission probably will be able win approval
from nations for its plan to delay sales of 900 million metric
tons, Gray said today by phone.  “I suspect they would have been doing negotiations in the
background,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
