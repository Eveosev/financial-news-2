Kenny Williamson, the “Eggman” of
New York’s Rucker Park who ascended to the front office of
National Basketball Association teams, died after a battle with
cancer. He was 65.  Williamson spent the past six years with the  Memphis
Grizzlies , most recently as assistant general manager, after
three seasons as scouting director for the Charlotte Bobcats. He
also spent six years as a scout with the  New York Knicks  and was
a college assistant for 21 years, working under coaches such as
Lou Carnesecca, Denny Crum and Jim Valvano.  “Anyone who ever met ‘Eggman’ will never forget him,”
Grizzlies General Manager  Chris Wallace  said in a statement
announcing Williamson’s death. “He had a huge personality and
was extremely well respected, both professionally and
personally.”  Williamson was a native of Harlem in upper Manhattan and a
well-known fixture at Rucker Park, where he was featured in a
television documentary and an NBA-produced film about the
historic basketball court. He got his nickname from a childhood
chore hauling laundry for his grandmother in a wicker basket
similar to one a local man used to deliver eggs, he was quoted
as saying in an interview on the Grizzlies’ website.  Williamson is survived by his wife, Nicole, five children
and four grandchildren, according to the Grizzlies, who said
funeral arrangements are pending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
