The Marguerite Fund, the European
Investment Bank-backed investor that’s seeking 1.5 billion euros
($1.9 billion), bought 50 percent of a Romanian wind farm from
EP Global Energy Ltd., a developer based in Cyprus.  EP Global will retain 20 percent of the 80-megawatt
Chirnogeni facility in Constanta, southeast  Romania , the
Marguerite Fund said in a statement. The remaining 30 percent
was bought by the Enercap Power Fund I LP, a private equity fund
managed by Czech Republic-based Enercap Capital Partners.  Romania is attracting investors including GDF Suez SA and
 Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW)  because of its renewables incentive
program, which grants green certificates for clean energy
produced and that power distributors must buy.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
provided a 91 million-euro loan for the construction and
operation of the project, which will cost about 130 million
euros in total, the London-based bank said in a separate e-
mailed statement.  The 13.5-year loan includes 31 million euros from the
EBRD’s own account and 60 million euros syndicated to  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS) , ING Bank NV and UniCredit Bank Austria AG.  The Marguerite Fund, with backers including  Germany ’s KfW
Group and Instituto de Credito Oficial, contributed equity. The
wind farm is slated to be commercially operational in early 2014
using 32 turbines made by German manufacturer Nordex SE,
according to the fund’s statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
