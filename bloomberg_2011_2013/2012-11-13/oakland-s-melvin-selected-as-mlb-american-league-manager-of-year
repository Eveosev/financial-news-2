Bob Melvin  was honored as American
League Manager of the Year after leading the Oakland Athletics
back from a 13-game deficit to win the AL West division title on
the final day of the Major League Baseball season.  The award is Melvin’s second. The 51-year-old won the
National League Manager of the Year award in 2007 with the
Arizona Diamondbacks.  The A’s, with a $55 million opening-day payroll that
according to USA Today ranked next-to-last among baseball’s 30
teams, trailed the  Texas Rangers  by 13 games on June 30. They
won their last six, coming back from a 5-1 deficit in the season
finale against the Rangers for a 12-5 victory to clinch the
division crown.  Melvin is the first Athletics manager to win the honor
since  Tony La Russa  in 1992. Earlier today,  Davey Johnson  of the
Washington Nationals was selected as the 2012 National League
Manager of the Year.  Melvin won the award in balloting by the Baseball Writers’
Association of America. Buck Showalter of the Baltimore Orioles
and Chicago White Sox manager Robin Ventura were the other
finalists.  The rest of the BBWAA’s annual awards will be announced
this week, including the AL and NL Cy Young Award winners
tomorrow honoring the top pitcher in each league.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
