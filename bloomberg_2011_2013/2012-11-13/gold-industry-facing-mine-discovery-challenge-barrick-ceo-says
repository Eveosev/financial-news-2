Gold discovery rates are decreasing
even as exploration spending in the industry reached a record $8
billion last year, according to Jamie Sokalsky, chief executive
officer of Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer.  There were three discoveries last year, compared with 11 in
1991, and none of those can be described as “supergiant,” or
holding more than 20 million ounces, Sokalsky said at a
conference in Hong Kong. Breakeven costs were rising, he said
today, predicting gold’s bull market shows no signs of ending.  Gold is poised for a 12th annual gain, driven by  increased
investor  and central-bank purchases as governments around the
world boost stimulus to revive their economies. Global gold mine
output may increase 0.7 percent in 2013, the slowest pace since
2008, according to Barclays Plc, which forecasts that total
physical supply may shrink 0.4 percent next year. A further
rally may not spur much higher output, he told the conference.  “I don’t see a surge in gold production if we saw a gold
price of $3,000,” Sokalsky said. “At a higher gold price, we’d
still be experiencing the same challenges. I’d suggest there’d
be very limited response to that higher gold price.”  Gold for immediate delivery, which climbed to a record
$1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6, 2011, traded at $1,725.97 at 6:02
p.m. in  Hong Kong  after rising 10 percent this year. The run of
annual gains is the best performance since at least 1920.  ‘Getting Harder’  “It’s getting harder to find large deposits and to get
those deposits into  production  takes at least twice as long as
it might have taken a decade ago,” Sokalsky said yesterday in
an interview. “We’re not going to see new mines coming in as
fast as we thought to replace old mines that are closing.”  World gold-mine production may increase to 2,672 metric
tons next year from an estimated 2,652 tons in 2012, according
to data from Barclays in a Nov. 8 report. Global scrap supply
may decline to 1,636 tons from 1,671 tons, reducing total supply
to 4,308 tons in 2013 from 4,323 tons, according to Barclays.  “Getting mines permitted, dealing with the government and
the communities, environmental issues, all of that takes so much
longer,” said Sokalsky, who took over as CEO in June after his
predecessor Aaron Regent was fired. “It also costs multitudes
more to build a mine and to finance that.”  Barrick reported third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1 that
missed analysts’ estimates after mining costs increased more
than expected and production fell.  Shares (ABX)  of the Toronto-based
company have declined 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
