The  Australia  dollar rose against
its U.S. counterpart on demand for global risk assets even as
stocks erased earlier gains.  Australia’s dollar advanced versus all but two of its 16
most-traded counterparts even after a business confidence index
slipped to minus 1 last month from zero in September, according
to a 400-company survey conducted by National Australia Bank
Ltd. New Zealand’s dollar fell against the greenback after
earlier rising as much as 0.4 percent.  “The decline in confidence is clearly having an impact on
aggregate demand,” Boris Schlossberg, managing director of
foreign exchange at BK Asset Management, an investment advisory
firm in  New York , wrote yesterday in a note to clients. ”All
three sectors of the economy -- manufacturing, construction and
broader services -- have all contracted this year.”  Australia’s currency appreciated 0.1 percent to $1.0435
yesterday in New York after earlier rising to $1.0446, its
highest level since Nov. 7. It fell 0.1 percent to 82.83 yen.  The  New Zealand dollar , nicknamed the kiwi, decreased 0.2
percent to 81.60 U.S. cents after reaching 82.04, also the
strongest level since Nov. 7. The kiwi declined 0.3 percent to
64.78 yen.  The Australian dollar may weaken to its lowest level since
Oct. 8 after it was unable to advance beyond the resistance area
from $1.0475 to $1.0480 last week,  Niall O’Connor , a  New York- 
based technical analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote yesterday
in a client note. If the currency falls below key support levels
of $1.0328 and $1.0355, it may depreciate to $1.0149, he said.  Resistance is an area on a chart where sell orders may be
clustered, and support is an area where there may be buy orders.  New Zealand ’s dollar has strengthened 4.8 percent this
year, the biggest gain among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie
has gained 1.2 percent, and the greenback is down 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
