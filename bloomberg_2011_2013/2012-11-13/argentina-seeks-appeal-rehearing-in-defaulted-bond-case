Argentina  asked a U.S. appeals court
to reconsider an Oct. 26 decision that it can’t make payments on
restructured sovereign debt without also paying holders of its
defaulted bonds.  The Argentine government today asked for a rehearing,
before a three-judge panel or before the entire U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York. The government said in a court filing that
the earlier ruling threatens “a seismic change in the landscape
of sovereign debt restructuring.”  The October decision was a victory for Elliott Management
Corp.’s NML Capital Fund and other investors that are trying to
collect on $1.3 billion in the defaulted bonds. The appeals
court returned the case to U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in
 Manhattan  to determine a payment formula and to explain how the
court’s orders apply to intermediary banks and other third
parties.  In a court conference Nov. 9, Griesa said he would rule on
those questions by Dec. 1. Argentina is scheduled to pay more
than $3 billion to holders of its restructured bonds in
December.  The case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina,
12-105, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
