YPF SA (YPF) , the nationalized oil
company, slid as much as 3.4 percent on concerns  Argentina  may
face a technical default as a New York judge is asking the
sovereign to submit a plan to pay holders of defaulted debt.  YPF slumped 3.4 percent to $10.10 at 3 p.m. in New York,
heading for  the lowest close  since Nov. 8, 2002.  YPF’s market value is about $4 billion, after losing 76.1
percent in the year. Spain’s  Repsol SA (REP)  had a 51 percent stake in
the company seized by Argentina’s government in April. The
Madrid-based company is seeking to obtain $10.5 billion in
compensation from Argentina for the expropriation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
