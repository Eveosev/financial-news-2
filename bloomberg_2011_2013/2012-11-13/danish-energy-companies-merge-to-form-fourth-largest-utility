EnergiMidt A/S and Elro A/S will
merge to form  Denmark ’s fourth-largest utility in terms of
sales, moving trading desks and seeking international growth.  “The merger gives us the right strategic fundaments for
future growth,” Jens Joern Justesen, chairman of the board of
EnergiMidt, said today in an e-mailed  statement . “Our markets
aren’t merely local, they’re national and to a certain extent
international.”  Under a decision taken yesterday, the companies will merge
under the name EnergiMidt A/S with sales of 3 billion Danish
kroner ($510 million) while energy trading activities will be
transfered from EnergiMidt’s office in Silkeborg to Randers,
where Elro is based, according to the statement.  Holger Blok, chief executive officer of EnergiMidt and
Chris Dahlerup, CEO of Elro, did not respond to phone calls
seeking comment.  Approval from the Danish Energy Agency and competition
authority is expected by the end of the year, while the merger
is to be completed in 2014, the companies said in a joint
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
