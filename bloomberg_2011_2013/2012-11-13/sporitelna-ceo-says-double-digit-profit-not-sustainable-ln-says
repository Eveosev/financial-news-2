Double-digit profit increases arenâ€™t
sustainable when the economy stagnates or grows only moderately,
Pavel Kysilka, the chief executive officer of Ceska Sporitelna
AS, said in an interview with  Lidove Noviny .  If interest rates are to remain low, which is probable,
profit will also be affected, according to the newspaper.
Sporitelna is the Czech unit of Erste Group AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
