Thailand’s baht retreated from a
two-week high as European leaders struggled to agree on aid for
Greece, raising concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening and
curbing demand for emerging-market assets. Bonds were steady.  Foreign funds sold $22 million more Thai equities than they
bought yesterday, following net sales in the previous  three
weeks , exchange data show. Euro-area finance ministers gave
Greece until 2016 to wrestle down its  budget deficit , but put
off a decision on how to cover the nation’s additional needs of
as much as 32.6 billion euros ($41 billion) until Nov. 20.  “Europe is weighing on the market,” said Tohru Nishihama,
an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .
“But with plenty of liquidity globally, funds will come back to
 emerging markets  when sentiment improves.”  The baht declined 0.1 percent to 30.66 per dollar as of
8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 30.59 yesterday, the strongest level since Oct. 29.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was unchanged at 4.27 percent.  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due May 2015 was 2.88
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
