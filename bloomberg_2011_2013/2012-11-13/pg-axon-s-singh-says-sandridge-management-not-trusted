Dinakar Singh , founder of $4 billion
hedge fund TPG-Axon Capital Management LP, increased the firm’s
stake in  SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD) ’s and said its management isn’t
trusted by investors.  “There is tremendous value” in SandRidge, Singh said
today in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Market
Makers” program with  Stephanie Ruhle  and Pimm Fox. “Management
is not trusted by the street,” said Singh, a former  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  partner who co-founded New York-based TPG Axon
in 2004.  TPG-Axon reported it owns 6.2 percent of SandRidge, up from
4.7 percent on Thursday, according to a filing.  SandRidge Chief Executive Officer  Tom Ward  said he’s a
major shareholder in the company, too, and also interested in
increasing its value.  Ward defended SandRidge’s strategy, including a decision to
sell its oil property in the Permian Basin. Selling the field
will allow SandRidge to concentrate on the Mississippian Lime
Field in Oklahoma and Kansas, where it can earn a higher rate of
return, Ward said. Analysts have said the Mississippian is worth
less because it produces more natural gas.  “Whether we produce oil, natural gas or ice cream -- if we
can make 50 percent rates of return, that’s what we want to
do,” Ward said.  Ward said he plans to meet with Singh.  In a Nov. 8 letter to Oklahoma City-based SandRidge’s
board, Singh recommended replacing Ward and selling the company
after a “disastrous” performance. SandRidge has declined 79
percent since it began trading in 2007.  SandRidge has overpaid its CEO and is an “insatiable
spender” with an incoherent strategy, Singh wrote in the
letter. SandRidge should replace some board members with
independent directors and representatives of large shareholders.  SandRidge rose 3.9 percent to close at $5.60 in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
