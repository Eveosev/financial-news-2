The Polish zloty weakened to a two-
month low as Euro-area finance ministers delayed a decision on
financial aid to  Greece  while German investor confidence
unexpectedly declined.  The zloty lost 0.2 percent to 4.1715 per euro as of 4:51
p.m. in Warsaw after touching the lowest since Sept. 6. It
retreated 0.8 percent this month for the steepest drop among
more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The yield on two-year notes was unchanged at 3.72 percent.  The euro area’s finance ministers put off until Nov. 20 a
decision on how to cover additional Greek needs of as much as
32.6 billion euros ($41.3 billion) and left unclear whether the
 International Monetary Fund  will continue to contribute.
 Germany ’s ZEW Center for European Economic Research’s index of
investor and analyst expectations, which aims to predict
economic developments six months in advance, fell to minus 15.7
from minus 11.5 in October, lagging analyst expectations.  “The market continues to be driven by external events
including the news from Greece and weak data,” Joanna Bachert,
an analyst at PKO Bank Polski SA, wrote in an e-mailed note
today. “From a technical perspective, the weakness has opened
the way to another resistance level between 4.18 and 4.20 per
euro.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
