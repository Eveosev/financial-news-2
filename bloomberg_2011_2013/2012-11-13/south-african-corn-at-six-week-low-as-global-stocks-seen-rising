South African corn declined to the
lowest in more than six weeks, following global prices, which
fell after favorable weather reports from  South America  and the
U.S reported its harvest may rise. Soybeans dropped.  South African white corn for delivery in December, the most
active contract, decreased 0.8 percent to 2,420 rand ($274) a
metric ton, the lowest since Oct. 1, by the midday close in
Johannesburg. The yellow variety fell 0.6 percent to 2,477 rand
a ton and soybeans dropped 1.5 percent to 5,265 rand a ton.  The U.S., the biggest producer of corn, will  harvest  2.97
billion bushels, up 3.9 percent. Rain in northern  Brazil  will
aid crop development, while drier weather accelerates planting
in  Argentina ,  World Weather Inc.  said in a report. World soybean
inventories will be 60 million metric tons on Oct. 1, 4.3
percent more than forecast in October, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said on Nov. 9.  “The world is feeling more and more comfortable with
stocks of corn and soybeans, Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg. ‘‘This is because
of the good weather that is supporting plantings in South
America.’’  Wheat for delivery in December, decreased 1 percent to
3,676.20 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
