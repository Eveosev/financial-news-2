Ford Motor Co. (F)  leads companies
selling $3.4 billion in asset-backed securities as auto debt
dominates the market.  The carmaker is offering $1.08 billion of bonds backed by
auto loans, according to people familiar with the transaction
who asked not to be identified because terms arenâ€™t public. GM
Financial, the provider of loans to buyers with poor credit
acquired by  General Motors Co. (GM) , is selling $1 billion in similar
debt, the people said.  Automobile debentures account for $92 billion of the $213
billion of asset-backed bonds linked to consumer and business
lending issued this year as vehicle sales surge, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford has
issued $5.2 billion of the securities tied to loans in 2012, up
from $2.52 billion last year, the data show.  U.S. light-vehicle sales rose 14 percent to 11.99 million
this year through October, according to researcher Autodata
Corp. That puts the U.S. on pace to increase annual deliveries
by at least 10 percent for the third consecutive year, the first
such streak since 1973.  Top-ranked securities linked to auto loans are yielding 28
basis points more than Treasuries, down from 94 basis points on
Dec. 31, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Other companies selling asset-backed securities include  CNH
Global NV (CNH) , the agricultural machinery maker, and brand manager
Iconix Brand Group Inc., the people said. CNH, based in
Amsterdam, is issuing $677 million in debt backed by equipment
loans. Iconix is marketing $500 million of bonds tied to
trademarks and license agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
