The ruble weakened to the lowest
level in two months as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner,
dropped and investors sold riskier assets after European
officials delayed a decision on Greek aid.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 31.7639
against the dollar at 1:13 p.m. in Moscow, the lowest since
Sept. 11. It lost 0.2 percent versus the euro to 40.3000 and was
0.4 percent down against the central bank’s euro-dollar target
basket.  European leaders have put off until next week a decision on
how to cover  Greece ’s additional funding needs, stoking concern
the debt crisis will drag on and curbing appetite for emerging-
market currencies and stocks. Oil dropped 0.8 percent to $84.82
per barrel in  New York . Crude and natural gas account for about
50 percent of Russia’s government revenue.  “The delay on the Greek bailout decision by  Europe  pushed
the Russian currency out of the previous range of 31.25-31.60
rubles per dollar,” Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign
exchange at Otkritie Financial Corp. in Moscow, said by e-mail.  The Russian central bank’s decision last week to leave its
key  interest rates  unchanged has contributed to the ruble’s
decline, he said.  Bank Rossii kept rates on hold on Nov. 9 after a surprise
increase in September. Consumer-price growth slowed to 6.4
percent as of Nov. 6 from a year earlier, Bank Rossii said.
That’s down from 6.5 percent in October.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 32.0825 per
dollar in three months compared with 32.2513 yesterday.  The extra yield that investors demand to own Russia’s
dollar bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  rose three basis points to
200, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An
index of five-year government bond yields rose two basis points
to 7.077 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
