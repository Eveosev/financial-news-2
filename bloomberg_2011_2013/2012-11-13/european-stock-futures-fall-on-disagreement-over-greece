European (SXXP)  stocks climbed, halting a
four-day decline for the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index, as
yields on benchmark Spanish bonds slipped amid speculation that
the country’s government will soon ask for a bailout.  Italian and Spanish lenders rallied as  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) 
jumped 5.2 percent after reporting that operating profit surged
in the third quarter. EON AG slumped 12 percent after Germany’s
biggest utility lowered its earnings forecast for 2013.  Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD)  slid 2.5 percent after the world’s  second-largest
mobile-phone company  took a $9.4-billion writedown for its
operations in Spain and Italy.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.4 percent to 270.6 at the close,
erasing an earlier decline of as much as 0.8 percent. The equity
benchmark  fell 1.9 percent  from President  Barack Obama ’s re-
election on Nov. 6 through yesterday as investors’ attention
turned to impending U.S. tax increases and spending cuts, known
as the fiscal cliff, and the  European debt crisis .  “There are rumors that a bailout for Spain is imminent and
that has pushed bond yields down,” said  Arnaud Scarpaci , a  fund
manager  at Agilis Gestion SA in Paris, which oversees about $77
million. “That explains the violent rebound in stocks.”  European stocks rebounded as yields on  benchmark 10-year
Spanish bonds  dropped four basis points to 5.85 percent.  National benchmark indexes gained in 14 of 18 western-
European markets today. France’s  CAC 40 (CAC)  rose 0.6 percent, while
the U.K.’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.3 percent. Germany’s DAX climbed
less than 0.1 percent.  Financing Gap  Euro-area finance ministers gave Greece an extra two years
to cut its  budget deficit  to 2 percent of gross domestic
product, pledging to plug the resulting financing gap to prevent
the country from leaving the single currency.  Finance ministers put off until Nov. 20 a decision on how
to cover additional Greek needs of as much as 32.6 billion euros
($41 billion) and left unclear whether the  International
Monetary Fund  will continue to contribute. IMF Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  disagreed with a decision by the
representatives of the 17-nation currency zone to postpone the
goal of getting Greece’s debt down to 120 percent of GDP by two
years, until 2022.  “European finance ministers now have to grapple with two
particularly thorny questions: how to finance Greece for the
next four years and how to ensure that Greece’s burgeoning debt
burden is sustainable?”  James Nixon , an economist at Societe
Generale SA in London, wrote in a report today.’  Intesa Surges  Intesa Sanpaolo soared 5.2 percent to 1.26 euros. Italy’s
second-biggest bank reported that operating earnings jumped 45
percent to 2.28 billion euros and capital levels rose.  “Intesa presented a very healthy set of results,”
Fabrizio Bernardi, a Milan-based analyst at Fidentiis Equities,
wrote in a note to clients. “Operating income is above
expectations due to better revenues and costs.”  A gauge of European lenders advanced 1.6 percent for the
largest gain of the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600.  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  climbed 4.4 percent to 3.52 euros.  Italy’s
biggest bank  reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates after a record loss a year earlier because of
writedowns. Net income increased to 335 million euros, compared
with a net loss of 10.6 billion euros a year earlier when the
Milan-based lender booked goodwill impairments of 8.7 billion
euros. Profit surpassed the 99 million-euro  average estimate  of
13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sonova Soars  Sonova Holding AG (SOON)  surged 8.5 percent to 100.90 Swiss
francs, its biggest rally in a year. The Swiss provider of
hearing products reported  first-half profit  that beat analysts’
estimates as its cochlear-implant segment became profitable and
the hearing-aid business expanded in the U.K. and Spain.  ITV Plc (ITV)  advanced 9 percent to 94.6 pence. The U.K.’s
biggest terrestrial commercial broadcaster said group external
revenue rose 4 percent in the first nine months of this year.
The company also raised a target for cost savings this year.  EON slumped 12 percent to 14.64 euros, its biggest retreat
in 20 years, after saying yesterday its forecast of 3.2 billion
euros to 3.7 billion euros of underlying net income next year
“no longer seems achievable” because gas-fired  power plants 
aren’t making money. The company also said it will consider
cutting  dividend payments .  The utility today reported profit that more than doubled in
the first nine months from a year earlier.  RWE AG (RWE)  slid 1.2
percent to 32.93 euros. The Stoxx 600 Utilities Index lost 1.9
percent, its largest retreat since September.  Vodafone, Pirelli  Vodafone slid 2.5 percent to 162.5 pence as the
announcement of the 5.9 billion-pound ($9.4 billion) impairment
outweighed its decision to start a 1.5 billion-pound buyback
plan.  Verizon Wireless  will pay an $8.5 billion dividend to its
co-owners, Vodafone and Verizon Communications Inc., by the end
of 2012, enabling Vodafone to finance the share buyback.  Service revenue fell 1.4 percent in the quarter ended Sept.
30, its first decline in 10 quarters and double the average
analyst projection for a contraction of 0.7 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Pirelli & C SpA (PC)  dropped 2.8 percent to 8.43 euros. Europe’s
third-largest tiremaker yesterday lowered its forecast for
revenue in 2012 by 250 million euros to 6.15 billion euros
because of Europe’s economic slowdown.  The Milan-based company predicted that debt will rise to
more than 1.2 billion euros from a previous target of less than
1.1 billion euros, according to a statement after markets closed
yesterday.  Third-quarter net income  fell 7.3 percent to 87
million euros, missing the average estimate of 102.2 million
euros in a  Bloomberg survey  of six analysts.  K+S, FLSmidth  K+S AG (SDF)  sank 4.5 percent to 34.29 euros. Europe’s largest
potash maker said it expects sales and profit in 2012 to only
reach the bottom of its targeted range as delays on Chinese and
Indian contracts restrain market prices for fertilizer.  FLSmidth & Co. A/S tumbled 6.6 percent to 329.40 kroner.
The Danish maker of mining equipment reported  third-quarter net
income  that missed analysts’ estimates. It also forecast an
annual profit margin before interest and taxes of 8 percent,
compared with a previous projection of as much as 9 percent.  Mondi Plc declined 2.4 percent to 640 pence. Barclays Plc
sold 19.3 million shares in the largest maker of office paper
and industrial bags in Europe at 634 pence apiece on behalf of a
client, according to two people close to the deal who asked not
to be identified because the transaction is private.  To contact the reporters on this story:
