  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) ’s more than
1 million government customers in  North America  are set to
upgrade to new BlackBerry 10 devices in droves, Chief Executive
Officer Thorsten Heins said today.  About 400,000 government customers worldwide got new
BlackBerry versions in the last year, and Heins said he expects
at least that number to splurge on the new models next year. RIM
said yesterday it will begin selling the phones in February on
multiple continents.  “I would be surprised if we don’t see quite a wave moving
over to BlackBerry 10,” Heins said during a Bloomberg
Government interview with reporters and editors.  Some of RIM’s earliest and most loyal customers have been
U.S. government agencies that have used BlackBerry devices for
more than a decade. Faced with a growing number of federal
offices that have embraced a bring-your-own device policy as a
way of saving money, Heins said he’s determined to win their
business.  The company is counting on BlackBerry 10, which allows
users to run multiple applications at once and lets them peek at
one program while running another, to stop two years of market
share losses to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and devices running  Google
Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software.  RIM tumbled 4.7 percent to $8.40 today in  New York , after
two days of gains. The shares have dropped 42 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
