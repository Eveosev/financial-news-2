The  Big East Conference  will have
two six-team divisions for the 2013 football season, which will
culminate with a new league championship game.  The East Division will feature  Rutgers University ,  Central
Florida , Cincinnati, Connecticut, Louisville and South Florida.
The West Division will be comprised of Boise State, Houston,
Memphis, San Diego State, Southern Methodist and Temple.  In the  new structure , announced by the league today, each
team will play eight conference games a season, five of those
against division rivals.  The Big East championship game will be played between the
division champions at the home field of one of the participating
schools, not a neutral site, the conference said in a statement.  Big East Commissioner Mike Aresco said the alignment
probably will be re-evaluated after the 2013 season, when the
U.S. Naval Academy and possibly other schools join the
conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
