The main opposition Socialist Party
led the ruling Social Democratic Party of Portuguese Prime
Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  by a narrower margin in a survey of
voters’ intentions, Jornal de Negocios reported.  The survey indicated 32.1 percent backing from  voters  for
the Socialists, 1.6 percentage point less than in an October
poll, the Portuguese newspaper said. The survey indicated 26.3
percent support for the Social Democrats, an increase of 1.4
percentage points, Negocios said.  The survey also indicated 7.9 percent support for the
conservative  People’s Party , which is part of the ruling
coalition, the same as in the previous poll, according to
Negocios.  The survey published today was carried out by Aximage
Comunicacao e Imagem Lda. from Oct. 30 to Nov. 6, and 602
interviews were used, Negocios said. The margin of error is 4
percent, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
