Nine Turkish lenders received
upgrades from Fitch Ratings today following its boost for the
country to investment grade last week.  Fitch lifted to investment grade TC Ziraat Bankasi AS,
 Turkey ’s biggest government-owned lender, and three other state
banks  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) ,  Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN)  and
 Turkiye Kalkinma Bankasi AS (KLNMA) , Fitch said in a statement. The
ratings company increased their long-term foreign-currency
issuer default ratings to BBB- from BB+. Five foreign-owned
banks including  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK)  were raised to BBB from
BBB-.  The upgrade for the state banks reflects the improved
ability of the government to provide support in case of need,
Fitch said. Fitch boosted Turkey’s foreign-currency ranking to
BBB- from BB+ and its outlook to stable Nov. 5, citing easing
near-term financial risks, a moderate and declining government
debt burden, a sound banking system, favorable growth prospects
and “a relatively wealthy and diverse economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
