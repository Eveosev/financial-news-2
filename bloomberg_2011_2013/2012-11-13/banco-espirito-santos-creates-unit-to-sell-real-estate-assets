Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest bank by market value, created a unit to sell real estate
assets that were repossessed from its clients, Chief Executive
Officer Ricardo Salgado said.  “We have many real estate assets,” Salgado told reporters
in Lisbon today. “But if we have many real estate assets that
is because we managed to recover credit faster than our
competitors.”  The Lisbon-based bank created a unit called Area de Gestao
Imobiliaria, or AGI, that is trying to sell these assets to
Portuguese emigrants and foreign investors in countries such as
China, Russia and  Brazil , he said.  Espirito Santo sold 1,267 real estate assets in the first
nine months of the year for 240 million euros compared to 1,289
real estate assets sold last year, Salgado said. About 40
percent of those assets were paid for immediately in cash, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
