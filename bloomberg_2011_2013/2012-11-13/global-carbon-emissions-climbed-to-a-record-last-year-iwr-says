Global carbon dioxide emissions from
fossil fuels rose 2.5 percent to a record last year on surging
pollution in  China ,  Germany ’s IWR research institude said.  Worldwide emissions rose 834 million metric tons to 33.99
billion tons, IWR said today on its  website . China’s releases of
the greenhouse gas climbed 6.5 percent, offsetting declines in
the U.S.,  Russia  and Germany, the Muenster-based institute said.  “If the current trend persists, global CO2 emissions will
go up by another 20 percent to over 40 billion tons by 2020,”
Norbert Allnoch, the IWR’s director, said in the statement.
Countries’ emission levels should be tied to mandatory
investments in climate protection such as renewable energy, the
IWR said.  Economies including  Brazil , China and India are raising
investments in renewable technologies to help meet their growing
energy demand. The projected surge in low-carbon sources won’t
be enough to meet the United Nations goal of limiting global
warming since industrialization to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6
degrees Fahrenheit), the International Energy Agency said
yesterday.  China was the biggest polluter, with emissions of 8.9
billion tons. The U.S. produced about 6 billion tons of carbon
dioxide and  India  was the third-biggest emitter with 1.8 billion
tons, the IWR data show.  Delegates from almost 200 nations agreed at UN talks in
December to reach a new climate protection deal by 2015 that
will enter force by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
