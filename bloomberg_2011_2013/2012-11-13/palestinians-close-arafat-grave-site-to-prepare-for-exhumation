The grave of Yasser Arafat in the
West Bank town of  Ramallah  has been closed to the public prior
to the exhumation of his remains by foreign medical teams, a
Palestinian official said today.  The move comes after an report on Al Jazeera television in
July, supported by Arafat’s widow Suha, raised suspicions he may
have been poisoned by the radioactive isotope polonium. Arafat,
who was chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, died
in a French hospital in 2004 at the age of 75 after suffering a
brain hemorrhage.  Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat’s
successor, subsequently gave permission to exhume the remains.  Palestinian official Tawfiq Tirawi said that Swiss, French,
Russian and Egyptian medical experts will take part in the
examination. “I can’t confirm a date, but it’s toward the end
of this month,” Tirawi said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
