The lira slumped to the weakest in
more than a month as Euro-area finance ministers delayed a
decision on financial aid to  Greece  while German investor
confidence unexpectedly declined, damping demand for riskier
assets.  The lira depreciated for a third day, declining 0.3 percent
to 1.8068 per dollar at 6:52 p.m. in Istanbul, the lowest since
Oct. 15. Yields on two-year debt closed unchanged at 6.38
percent following declines in the past six days to the least
since at least 2005.  As euro-region finance chiefs pushed back the goal of
getting Greece’s debt down to a “sustainable” level by two
years until 2022, International Monetary Fund Managing Director
Christine Lagarde disagreed and said the timetable has to be
2020. The European Union buys 39.2 percent of Turkish exports,
according to data published by the  statistics office  on Oct. 31.  “The market is worried about Greece,” Suha Yaygin, deputy
head of  emerging markets  at Toronto Dominion Bank in  London ,
said in e-mailed comments. “Economic growth does not look
possible to me with so much austerity and belt tightening.”  Germany ’s ZEW Center for European Economic Research’s index
of investor and analyst expectations, which aims to predict
economic developments six months in advance, fell to minus 15.7
from minus 11.5 in October, lagging analyst expectations.  Turkey ’s central bank cut lending at its lowest funding
rate of 5.75 percent to the least in two months, providing 1.5
billion liras ($830.6 million) in a one-week repurchase
agreement auction today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
