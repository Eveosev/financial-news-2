     Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the
second-largest maker of personal-computer processors, said it
isn’t actively pursuing a sale of the company or a significant
sale of assets.  “AMD’s board and management believe that the strategy the
company is currently pursuing to drive long-term growth by
leveraging AMD’s highly differentiated technology assets is the
right approach to enhance shareholder value,” Drew Prairie, a
spokesman for AMD, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The statement came after Reuters reported that AMD hired
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to explore options, including a potential
sale of the company or its patent portfolio. AMD  shares  fell 7.7
percent to $1.93 at the close in New York. Yesterday they surged
as much as 18 percent following the Reuters report, then pared
gains to close up 5 percent.  Last month, AMD gave a forecast for fourth-quarter sales
that fell short of analysts’ estimates and said it would cut 15
percent of its staff, citing weak demand across all product
lines in a challenging economic environment.  The revenue projection put the Sunnyvale, California-based
company on course for its fourth consecutive quarterly sales
decline. That led analysts such as Sanford C Bernstein & Co.’s
Stacy Rasgon to predict that, if the trend continues, cash
reserves may fall short of what AMD says it needs. The stock has
dropped 64 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
