Romania ’s central bank will probably
ask some local lenders to increase their provisions at the
beginning of next year, Deputy Governor Bogdan Olteanu said.  The new provisions will be triggered by a reevaluation of
assets pledged as collateral for loans granted by the banks in
the country, Olteanu said at a conference in Bucharest today.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei has asked commercial banks
to adjust the value of collateral to current market conditions
after a two-year recession pushed asset prices down.  “We are in the procedure of revising the collaterals and
where it is necessary, probably at the beginning of next year,
we will ask for new provisions,” Olteanu said.  He also said non-performing loans in the banking system
currently exceed 17 percent of total lending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
