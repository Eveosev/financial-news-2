Portugal ’s  economy  will contract for
a third year in 2013 as the government raises taxes and
investment drops, the country’s central bank said.  Gross domestic product will shrink 1.6 percent after
declining an estimated 3 percent in 2012, the Lisbon-based Bank
of Portugal said today in its autumn economic bulletin. In July,
the bank forecast no growth for 2013.  “The sharp contraction in internal demand will only be
partially compensated by the positive performance of net
 external demand ,” the central bank said in a statement.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
joblessness and a deepening recession as he cuts spending and
raises taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($99
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . Portugal has already been given more time to
narrow its budget shortfall after  tax revenue  missed forecasts.  “Managing the Portuguese economy’s adjustment process
places important political challenges,” the Bank of Portugal
said. “An eventual moderation of the intensity of the
adjustment effort, namely at the level of the budget, is
conditioned by the guarantee of financing conditions for the
Portuguese economy and implies a greater accumulation of debt,
worsening the conditions of its sustainability.”  The bank forecasts investment will drop 14.9 percent in
2012 and 10 percent next year, while private consumption will
decline 5.8 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. It projects
inflation of 2.8 percent for this year and 0.9 percent in 2013.  Exports will grow 6.3 percent in 2012 and 5 percent in
2013. Portugal’s current- and capital-account deficit will
narrow to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2012 and it will post a surplus
of 4 percent in 2013, according to the Bank of Portugal.  Portugal’s  economic growth  has averaged less than 1 percent
a year for the past decade, placing it among  Europe ’s weakest
performers. The government projects GDP will shrink 1 percent in
2013 after contracting 3 percent this year. The  unemployment
rate  will rise to 16.4 percent in 2013 from 15.5 percent this
year.  The government aims to reduce its deficit to 5 percent of
GDP in 2012 instead of the previous goal of 4.5 percent, Finance
Minister Vitor Gaspar said on Sept. 11 after EU and IMF
officials agreed on the new targets. It aims for a deficit of
4.5 percent in 2013 and will only cut the shortfall below the
EU’s 3 percent limit in 2014, when it targets a 2.5 percent gap.  The country’s  debt  will peak at 124 percent of GDP in 2014,
higher than a July forecast for debt to peak at 118 percent in
2013, the IMF said in a report released on Oct. 25. The increase
in the projection is due to the slower pace of fiscal
adjustment, the recession extending into 2013, and “more
conservative” projections for privatization revenue, the IMF
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
