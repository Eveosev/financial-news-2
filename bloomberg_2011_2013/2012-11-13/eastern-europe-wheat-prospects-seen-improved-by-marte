Wheat conditions in Eastern Europe
improved after heavy rain in October ended drought,
agricultural-weather forecaster Martell Crop Projections said.  Wheat development will continue if warm temperatures
persist, allowing the crop to make up for lost time, Whitefish
Bay, Wisconsin-based Martell wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Satellite vegetation data at the end of September was
“stunningly bad,” with  Romania ,  Bulgaria , Hungary, Poland and
 Serbia  worse than a year ago, according to Martell. Heavy
rainfall last month improved prospects, the forecaster said.  “More rain is still needed to replenish parched fields,
but at least there is hope for improvement,” Martell wrote.
“Drought-ending rains last season did not develop until January
when cold weather stifled growth. Wheat this season has a better
chance to develop before very cold conditions set in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
