Volkswagen AG (VOW)  issued $2.6 billion of
debt in a four-part offering that includes fixed- and floating-
rate notes.  The car manufacturer with $12.6 billion of bonds maturing
next year sold $150 million of 18-month notes to yield 50 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate and $950
million of two-year notes to yield 60 basis points more than the
benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 18-month
portion was added after the deal was initially marketed earlier
today, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The company also issued $850 million of 1.15 percent,
three-year bonds to yield 85 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and $650 million of 1.6 percent, five-year
securities at a relative yield of 105 basis points, Bloomberg
data show.  The debt was issued through the Wolfsburg, Germany-based
company’s Volkswagen International Finance unit and may be rated
A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, said the person, who asked not
to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.
