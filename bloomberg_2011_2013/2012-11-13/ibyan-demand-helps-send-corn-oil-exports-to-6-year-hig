Global exports of corn oil reached a
six-year high in the past season, in part because of rising
shipments to  Libya  after the toppling of Muammar Qaddafi’s
regime, Oil World said.  World corn oil shipments jumped 18 percent in the year
ended Sept. 30 to 900,000 metric tons, the Hamburg-based
researcher said today in an e-mailed statement. U.S. exports
increased to Spain,  Egypt  and  Venezuela , with much of the supply
to Spain re-exported into North Africa, it said. Libya imported
about 100,000 tons of corn oil in the 2011 calendar year, it
said.  “In Libya the overthrow of the Qaddafi regime apparently
paved the way for a doubling of corn oil imports” in 2011, with
purchases increasing further through at least the first nine
months of 2012, Oil World said. “Part of the corn oil, mainly
U.S. origin, entered the country via  Spain  and  Tunisia .”  Both exports and domestic consumption of corn oil
“increased significantly” in the U.S. in the 2011-12 season,
Oil World said. U.S. use of the oil for biodiesel production
jumped to 223,000 tons from October 2011 to August 2012, up more
than 90 percent from a year earlier. About 60 percent of dry-
mill ethanol plants will produce corn oil by next year, allowing
for annual production of about 300,000 gallons of corn oil-based
biofuel, it said, citing the Environmental Protection Agency.  U.S. net imports of oils and fats totaled 2.1 million tons
in the 2011-12 season that ended Sept. 30, up from 1.1 million
tons a year earlier, Oil World said. Usage of  palm oil  and
canola oil also “increased sharply,” it said. Net imports may
rise in the current season after drought hurt corn and soybean
crops with palm oil needed “to fill in the supply gap to a
large extent.”  World exports of sunflower seed oil may shrink by 1.1
million tons to 6.1 million tons in the 2012-13 season, Oil
World said. Global exportable supplies of sesame seed also are
expected to shrink, as production in  India  falls to a four-year
low at 680,000 tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
