Vincent Reinhart , chief U.S.
economist at  Morgan Stanley (MS) , said the U.S. slipping over the so-
called fiscal cliff at the end of the year may be acceptable if
it allows U.S. politicians a few extra weeks to come up with a
budget deal.  “There is a drop-dead date -- the middle of February”
when the U.S. hits the debt ceiling, Reinhart said in a
television interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Sara Eisen in  New York  today. “One of the things
they’ve got to get around to is raising the debt ceiling.”  He said there are two scenarios to the U.S. falling over
the fiscal cliff of about $607 billion in automatic tax
increases and spending cuts, which he described as “scary” and
“optimistic.”  “If it is just buying two weeks’ time as the parties
jockey for better position and we get a modified grand bargain
sooner than everybody expects, resolving a lot of uncertainty
with some market-friendly features -- that’s good,” Reinhart
said. “Bad is if we find it stretching on and on.”  “Politicians always act at the last minute,” he said.
“The last minute is the debt ceiling. It’s not Dec. 31, it’s
the middle of February.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
