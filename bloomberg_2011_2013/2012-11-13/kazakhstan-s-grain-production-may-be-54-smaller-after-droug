Kazakhstan’s grain crop may be 54
percent smaller than last year because of drought, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  Production may be 12.3 million metric tons, after drying
and cleaning, from a record 26.9 million tons last year, the
ministry said in a statement today. Grain was harvested from
15.1 million hectares (39 million acres), with the yield falling
to an average 980 kilograms (0.98 ton) a hectare from 1,530
kilograms last year, it said.  Exports may be 7 million to 8 million tons, Muslim
Umiryayev, deputy agriculture minister, told reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
