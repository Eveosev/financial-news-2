Gasoline declined in  New York  Harbor
as Irving Oil Corp. said it was preparing to bring its Saint
John refinery in New Brunswick fully online within the week
after completing maintenance.  The refinery, which has a capacity of 298,800 barrels a
day, began a 12-week, $50 million maintenance project in early
September that focused mainly on the plant’s butamer and
alkylation units. The plant ships more than half of its
production to U.S. Northeast, according to the company’s
website.  The premium for  conventional gasoline  to be blended with
ethanol in New York fell 10.5 cents to 19.5 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
3:44 p.m.  Prompt delivery  decreased 12.75 cents to $2.8488 a
gallon.  Motiva Enterprises LLC said today it resumed limited
operations at its Newark terminal Nov. 9. Inspections are
continuing at terminals in  Brooklyn  and Long Island.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  climbed 0.5 cent to a premium of
19.5 cents a gallon to heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
