Doosan Heavy Industries &
Construction Co., a South Korea power equipment maker, said it
acquired a British water treatment company that was in
administration in a bid to boost its desalination business, the
Yonhap news agency reported without citing anyone.   Doosan Heavy didn’t reveal terms of the deal for Enpure
Ltd., which designs and installs water and waste treatment
plants, Yonhap said. Visitors to the enpure.co.uk website today
were told the site was “under construction” and advised to
direct all e-mails to Avtar Jirh at doosan.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
