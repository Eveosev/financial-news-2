A majority of Americans expect the
U.S. to go over the fiscal cliff at the beginning of 2013 and
would blame Republicans if that happened, according to a poll
published today.  The  survey  by the Pew Research Center and the Washington
Post found 51 percent of those polled said they don’t think
President  Barack Obama  and Congress will be able to agree on a
package of tax increases and spending cuts to replace the
automatic reductions in  government spending  and the expiration
of the Bush-era tax cuts scheduled for Jan. 1. Thirty-eight
percent said they expected Obama and Congress to cut a deal.  If lawmakers fail to reach a deal, 53 percent said
Republicans in Congress will bear responsibility, compared with
29 percent who said Obama will be at fault and 10 percent who
chose both sides.  The fiscal cliff refers to a $607 billion combination of
automatic spending cuts and tax increases scheduled for 2013
that were enacted as part of an agreement to raise the federal
debt limit.  More than two-thirds of those polled, 68 percent, said the
automatic spending cuts and tax increases would have a major
effect on the economy, and 62 percent said it would be mostly
negative. In addition, 44 percent of respondents said the fiscal
cliff would have a significant impact on their personal
financial situation and 60 percent of those said it would be
mostly negative.  The survey of 1,000 adults was taken Nov. 8-11 and had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
