Former Walt Disney Co. Chairman
 Michael Eisner  signed a movie distribution deal with Universal
Pictures, a key step toward his return to film production.  The Los Angeles-based studio, a unit of  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , will
handle distribution and marketing for films fully financed by
Tornante Co., the former Disney chief’s company, the parties
said today in a statement. Financial terms weren’t announced.  Eisner, 70, is seeking a return to the film business
through closely held Tornante, which he established in 2005
after leading Disney for 21 years. His company, along with
Madison Dearborn Partners, owns Topps Co., the marketer of
sports cards and candy. He also founded Vuguru, a company that
produces videos for digital and international outlets.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, fell 0.2 percent to $36.11
at the close in New York. The shares have gained 52 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
