Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said Andy Lees was
named head of corporate development and strategy, part of a push
by Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer  to step up growth and
fend off competitors led by Apple Inc.  Lees, who assumed the new job last month, reports to Chief
Financial Officer Peter Klein and handles a role that’s been
vacant since Hank Vigil left the company in 2011. Since being
replaced as president of the Windows Phone division last year,
Lees has overseen Microsoft’s investment in a  Barnes & Noble
Inc. (BKS)  subsidiary.  Ballmer moved Lees out of Windows Phone in December after
the product failed to gain mobile market share following a
complete overhaul. Though Lees was allowed to retain his
president title, he was given a vague job description that
Ballmer called “working for me on a time-critical opportunity
focused on driving maximum impact in 2012 with Windows Phone and
Windows 8.”  Lees wound up leading a deal with Barnes & Noble that had
Microsoft investing $300 million in a new subsidiary that
combines the bookseller’s Nook digital reader and college
businesses in order to bolster Microsoft’s access to book
content it can offer on new Windows tablet devices.  The job change was announced by Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
