New Generation Power , a U.S. energy
developer, signed an agreement today with the Bosnian Serb
 government  on building four hydro plants on the Drina river in
central Balkans.  The plants of 365 megawatts combined capacity may cost 1.3
billion euros ($1.65 billion) to build, according to a statement
on the  website  of Republika Srpska, the Serb part of Bosnia
Herzegovina. Pending a feasibility study, the government-owned
power producer Elektroprivreda Republike Srpske may form a
venture with New Generation Power to develop the plants as a
concession, it said.  The river Drina forms the border between Bosnia and  Serbia .
NGP, which focuses on renewable energy projects, held talks
earlier this year with Serbiaâ€™s state utility, Elektroprivreda
Srbije, on possible construction of these and other plants in
the Balkan country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
