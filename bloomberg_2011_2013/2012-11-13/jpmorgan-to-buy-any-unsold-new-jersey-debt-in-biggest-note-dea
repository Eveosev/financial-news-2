Not enough buyers for $2.6 billion
of  New Jersey  notes? No problem.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , underwriter for the sale, will
purchase any unsold debt from the state’s tax-and-revenue
anticipation note deal set to price Nov. 15, according to bond
documents. It’s New Jersey’s largest-ever short-term debt sale
and will repay a loan from  Bank of America Merrill Lynch .  JPMorgan will price the notes at a yield of 0.35 percent or
less, with the bank buying any remaining debt.  “The underwriter will purchase any unsold Series C notes,
at a yield agreed upon with the state which shall not exceed
thirty-five basis points,” according to bond documents.  Andy Pratt , a spokesman for New Jersey Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff, didn’t immediately respond to voicemail and e-
mail requests for comment.  Elizabeth Seymour, spokeswoman for JPMorgan, confirmed the
bank’s obligation to buy any residual notes.  JPMorgan’s commitment to buying any remaining debt was
first reported by Dow Jones Newswires.  The state originally planned to sell the short-term debt,
which matures June 2013, through competitive bid last month.
Superstorm Sandy changed those plans. The storm slammed into New
Jersey on Oct. 29 with hurricane-force winds and surging
floodwaters, leaving half the state in the dark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
