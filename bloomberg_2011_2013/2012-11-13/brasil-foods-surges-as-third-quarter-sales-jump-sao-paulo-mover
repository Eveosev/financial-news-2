BRF- Brasil Foods  SA, the world’s
largest poultry exporter, rallied the most in almost three
months as third-quarter sales exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Shares gained 3.6 percent to 37.70 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo , the steepest advance since Aug. 21. The
benchmark Bovespa index added 0.7 percent.  Third-quarter adjusted revenue increased 14 percent to 7.2
billion reais ($3.5 billion), compared with the 6.9 billion
reais mean estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Exports jumped 26 percent to 3.1 billion reais and sales in the
domestic market advanced 7 percent to 4.1 billion reais, the
company said yesterday in a filing with regulators after the
market closed.  “Brasil Foods positively surprised with slightly higher-
than-anticipated sales,” Joseph Giordano and  Daniela Bretthauer , analysts at Raymond James Brasil SA, wrote in a note
to clients published yesterday. The gain showed “an improved
environment for pricing and volume” on exports,  they wrote.  Brasil Foods has risen 3.6 percent this year, outperforming
the Bovespa’s 1.3 percent advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
