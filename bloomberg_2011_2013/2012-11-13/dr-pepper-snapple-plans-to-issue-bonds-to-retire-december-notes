Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS)  sold
$500 million of bonds in two parts to retire $450 million of
maturing debt.  The soft-drink maker with less  debt relative to earnings 
than  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  and  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  issued equal $250 million
portions of 2 percent, senior unsecured notes maturing in
January 2020 to yield 110 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and 2.7 percent bonds due November 2022 with
a 115 basis-point spread, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Proceeds from the offering will be used to refinance its
2.35 percent securities due next month, the Plano, Texas-based
company said today in a regulatory filing.  Dr Pepper Snapple’s $250 million of 3.2 percent bonds due
in 2021 traded at 103.6 cents on the dollar Nov. 5 to yield 2.74
percent with a 105 basis-point spread, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  The company’s $2.8 billion of total debt as of Sept. 30 is
2.1 times its trailing 12-month earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, Bloomberg  data  show. That
compares with 2.61 at Coca-Cola and 2.36 at PepsiCo, which both
have higher ratings and market capitalization at least 11 times
larger than Dr Pepper Snapple.  The new bonds may be rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, three levels above speculative grade, according to a
person familiar with the offering who asked not to be identified
because terms aren’t set. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are both ranked
Aa3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
