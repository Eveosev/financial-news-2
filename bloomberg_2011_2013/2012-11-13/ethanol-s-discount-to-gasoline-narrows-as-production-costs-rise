Ethanol’s  discount  to gasoline
narrowed as production costs for the biofuel increased.  The grain-based additive cost 31.68 cents a gallon less
than gasoline, down from a difference of 34.93 cents yesterday,
based on futures market prices. Gasoline traded at a premium of
99.8 cents a gallon to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28.  Ethanol followed corn higher on signs U.S. farmers are
holding onto supply in an effort to stem a 14 percent decline
from a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10. One bushel of the grain
makes at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  Denatured ethanol for December delivery advanced 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.337 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have risen 6.1 percent this year. Gasoline for December
delivery fell 2.25 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.6538 a gallon on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  “There weren’t many sellers of ethanol here,” said Jordan
Stern, a trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago.  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast dropped 5
cents to $2.495 a gallon and in  New York  the additive decreased
3.5 cents to $2.435, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf fell 2 cents to $2.41 a gallon and
in Chicago the biofuel slipped 1 cent to $2.35.  Corn Futures  Corn for March delivery added 4 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$7.2625 a bushel in Chicago.  About 42 percent of this year’s crop will be consumed by
ethanol, up from 40 percent last year, according to the
Agriculture Department.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 29 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
28 cents on yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be made
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said today it will
decide “shortly” whether to maintain, reduce or suspend the
country’s ethanol mandate. A bipartisan group of lawmakers asked
the Obama administration to halt or lower the requirement
because drought reduced corn yields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
