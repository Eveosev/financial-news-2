Oil rose from the lowest close this
year in  New York  on signs that crude supplies may be reduced by
a strike in Nigeria and the threat of sanctions on Iran.  The Nigerian oil union Pengassan said it has started the
process of shutting the platforms of Africaâ€™s top petroleum
producer to support demands for the return of fuel subsidies by
labor unions. Japan may significantly reduce its imports of
crude from Iran, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  Futures for February settlement rose as much as 46 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $101.33 a barrel in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was at $101.30 at
10:59 a.m. Sydney time. Crude yesterday slipped 1.3 percent to
$100.87, the lowest close since Dec. 30.  Refiners in  Europe  have begun to halt spot purchases of
crude from Iran ahead of a European Union meeting this month
that could lead to a full oil embargo on the country, the
Financial Times reported, citing industry executives and
traders.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
