Drydocks World LLC, the ship-repair
unit of state-controlled Dubai World, won a contract from
 Norway ’s Aibel AS to build the world’s biggest offshore power
converter platform for wind power.  Drydocks World will build the facility, which will receive
electricity from wind farms, in Dubai for the DolWin wind farm
cluster near Dollart in the German sector of the  North Sea , the
company said in a statement distributed at a news conference
today. It didn’t disclose the value of the deal.  The company will begin building the platform in July and
expects to complete it next year before shipping it to Aibel’s
yard in Haugesund, Norway for outfitting and installation at its
North Sea site in the summer of 2014.  The converter platform, which will use 20,000 tons of steel
and convert alternating power into direct current, will be the
largest such facility ever built, Aibel President and Chief
Executive Officer Jan Skogseth told reporters in Dubai.  The
platform will be 92.3 meters long and 72.8 meters wide.  Drydocks World, which is in talks with banks to delay
payments on $2.2 billion of debt, will need to increase staff by
10 percent to build the platform, Chairman Khamis Juma Buamin
said at the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
