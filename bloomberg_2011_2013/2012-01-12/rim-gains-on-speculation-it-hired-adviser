Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , maker of
the BlackBerry smartphone, advanced on speculation that the
company has hired a strategic adviser.  RIM rose 5.3 percent to $16.44 at the close in New York.
The Waterloo, Ontario-based company’s stock has jumped at least
5 percent more than 10 times since the beginning of August on
speculation a decline in its valuation will invite a takeover.  “That’s what’s driving it, exactly,” said  Matt Thornton ,
an analyst at Avian Securities LLC in Boston. There have been
several similar rumors recently, said Thornton, who rates RIM
“neutral.” “Whether this has any more meat to it, is hard to
say.”  Heidi Davidson, a spokeswoman for RIM, said the company
doesn’t comment on market rumors or speculation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
