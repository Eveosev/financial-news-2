South Africa ’s government said it
will expand access to universities and colleges as part of a
drive to counter youth unemployment and address skills shortages
in Africa’s largest economy.  A draft policy document on post-school education envisions
1.5 million students being enrolled in university by 2030, up
from 899,120 last year, and a further 4 million attending other
tertiary-education institutions, a sixfold increase.  “Approximately 3 million young people between the ages of
18 and 24 are not accommodated in either the education and
training system or the labor market,” Higher Education Minister
Blade Nzimande told reporters today at the release of the policy
paper in Pretoria, the capital. “This is an appalling waste of
human potential and a potential source of serious social
instability.”  President  Jacob Zuma ’s administration has made improving
the education system a priority as it seeks to drive the
 unemployment  rate down to 14 percent by 2020, from 25 percent
currently. Companies such as  Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the world’s largest
producer of motor fuel from coal, and packaging producer  Nampak
Ltd. (NPK)  have complained of a shortage of skilled workers.  South African universities can’t accommodate all students
wanting to attend. On Jan. 10, youths stampeded through the
gates of the University of Johannesburg, hoping to secure
admission. Gloria Sekwena, the mother of a prospective student,
died after being trampled, while more than 20 other people were
injured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
