Emerging-market stocks rose, driving
the benchmark index to the highest level in a month, as
borrowing costs fell for some European nations.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  gained 0.5 percent to
953.48 at the close in New York, the highest since Dec. 7. The
 BUX Index (BUX)  rose 1.6 percent after Hungary sold more bonds than
planned at an auction today as financing costs fell. Brazil’s
 Bovespa Index (IBOV)  fell for the first time in five days.  Government financing concerns eased as Spain sold twice its
maximum target of 5 billion euros ($6.4 billion) in an auction
of bonds maturing in 2015 and 2016, while borrowing costs
plunged in an Italian debt sale. Still, American jobless claims
and retail sales data fell short of analysts’ estimates.  “After a positive reaction to the auction results, the
U.S. numbers have spoiled the party a little bit,” Daniel Lenz,
the chief emerging-markets strategist at DZ Bank AG, said in an
interview from Frankfurt. “The auctions for Italian and Spanish
bonds were far better than expected. The auction yields were
much lower.”  The  European Central Bank  left its benchmark  interest rate 
at 1 percent today, in line with the median forecast of 53
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said “there are tentative signs of stabilization of
economic activity” while “the economic outlook remains subject
to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks.”  Developing-nation equities have added 4 percent this year,
besting the 2.1 percent gains for developed markets. Emerging-
market stocks remain cheaper than those in developed nations,
trading for 9.7 times projected earnings. Developed-country
shares trade for 11.7 times forecast profits.  Real, Bovespa  Brazilian stocks slid 0.1 percent.  Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s
largest iron-ore producer, fell 1.1 percent after saying it will
lose 2 million metric tons of production, or 0.6 percent of last
year’s output target, because of heavy rains.  The real appreciated 1.3 percent against the dollar and the
ruble advanced 0.5 percent.  The forint strengthened 0.9 percent against the euro as
 Hungary  sold 44 billion forint ($181 million) of bonds, 11
billion forint more than planned, in an auction.  Oil dropped 1.8 percent after a proposed European Union
embargo of Iranian oil imports was said likely to be delayed for
six months.  Solar Companies  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell less than 0.1 percent
after the government in Beijing said Chinese consumer prices
rose 4.1 percent in December from a year earlier last month,
slowing from a 4.2 percent rate of increase in November.  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Co. (3800) , China’s biggest polysilicon
manufacturer, jumped 14 percent in  Hong Kong  and  OCI Co. (010060) , South
Korea’s biggest maker of the material, surged 15 percent. The
price for polysilicon, the raw material used to make most solar
panels, rose 3 percent last week, the most in eight months,
Bloomberg New Energy Finance data showed.  Infosys (INFO)  sank 8.4 percent in Mumbai, its biggest loss since
April, after the company cut its sales estimate for the year
ending March 31 to a range of $7.029 billion to $7.033 billion.
The company forecast in October its sales would range from $7.08
billion to $7.2 billion.  Spain, Italy  Spain auctioned 9.98 billion euros ($12.7 billion) of bonds
maturing in 2015 and 2016, twice the maximum target of 5 billion
euros set for the sale. The yield on the three-year notes was
3.384 percent, compared with 5.187 percent when the nation sold
similar notes in December.  Italy sold 12 billion euros of Treasury bills, meeting its
target, and its borrowing costs plunged. The Rome-based Treasury
sold 8.5 billion euros one-year bills at a rate of 2.735
percent, down from 5.952 percent at the last auction.  U.S. jobless claims rose by 24,000 to 399,000 last week,
higher than the median estimate of 375,000 in a Bloomberg News
survey of 46 economists. Retail sales rose 0.1 percent, less
than the projected 0.3 percent pace. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 
Index added 0.2 percent.  The extra  yield  investors demand to own emerging-market
debt over U.S. Treasuries fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 430, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. ’s
