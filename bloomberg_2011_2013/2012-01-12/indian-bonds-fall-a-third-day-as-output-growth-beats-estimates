India ’s 10-year bonds fell for a
third day as government data showed factory  output  rose faster
than economists forecast, tempering speculation the central bank
will lower  interest rates  this month.  Yields rose to a one-week high as the  Central Statistical
Office  said in  New Delhi  that industrial production increased
5.9 percent in November from a year earlier. The median of 27
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 2.1 percent gain.
The nation will sell 140 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) of notes
due in 2020, 2024 and 2030 tomorrow. The central bank is due to
review borrowing costs on Jan. 24.  “There is little chance of a rate cut this month as the
economy seems to be doing well,” said Krishnamurthy Harihar,
treasurer in Mumbai at FirstRand Ltd. “Unabated debt supplies
are also weighing bonds down.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.25 in Mumbai in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That is
the highest level since Jan. 5.  The  Reserve Bank  of India boosted its  repurchase  rate by
3.75 percentage points in the last two years to 8.5 percent to
cool inflation. The government increased its borrowing target
for the year through March by 8.5 percent last month to a record
5.1 trillion rupees.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
fell one basis point to 7.87 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
