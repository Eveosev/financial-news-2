Roy L. Ash, a co-founder and
president of Litton Industries Inc. tapped by President  Richard
Nixon  to help make the government more efficient, then to
oversee the budget, has died. He was 93.  He had  Parkinson’s disease  and died Dec. 14 at his home in
 Los Angeles , the Los Angeles Times reported, citing his wife,
Lila.  Ash was Nixon’s fourth and final  budget director , appointed
in February 1973 to succeed Caspar W. Weinberger. He kept the
post through Nixon’s resignation and the start of  Gerald Ford ’s
presidency, departing in February 1975.  Ash and Charles “Tex” Thornton bought control of an
electronics company headed by Charles Litton in 1953. Thornton,
with whom Ash served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World
War II, intended to turn the company into a diversified leader
in science and technology, according to a New York Times
 obituary  of Thornton in 1981.  Under Thornton’s leadership, with Ash serving as a senior
executive until becoming president in 1961, Litton grew to be
one of the leading U.S. military contractors. Annual sales
increased from $3 million in 1953, when it specialized in
microwave tubes, to $1 billion in 1966, when its 5,000 products
ranged from oil drilling rigs to credit cards, the Times said.
 Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  bought Litton in 2001 for about $5.1
billion.  Joining Nixon  Ash remained Litton’s president until 1972. He began
working with Nixon in 1968 and a year later was named chairman
of the President’s Advisory Council on Executive Reorganization,
which became known as the Ash Council. Its recommendations
including reconstituting the Bureau of the Budget into what
became the White House  Office of Management and Budget  -- which
Ash would go on to lead.  Ash told the Los Angeles Times in 1977 that the intent in
creating the OMB “was not to build an empire. I’m one who
believes the least government is the best government. My goal
was to impose managerial responsibility on the spending of more
than $300 billion a year.”  That was the approximate federal budget outlay when Ash ran
OMB in the mid-1970s; in 2012, it’s projected to top $3.7
trillion.  Roy Lawrence Ash was born on Oct. 20, 1918, in Los Angeles,
according to  biographical  information on the website of the
Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.  Top of Class  After serving in the U.S. military, he earned a master’s in
business administration from the Harvard School of Business in
1947, graduating first in his class, according to a biography on
the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum  website . He
never attended college as an undergraduate.  After Harvard, Ash worked at Bank of America National Trust
& Savings Association in  San Francisco  and as chief financial
officer of Hughes Aircraft Co. in Culver City,  California .  Following his work in federal government, Ash led
Addressograph-Multigraph (later AM International) from 1976 to
1981. He was vice chairman of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing
Committee from 1980 to 1985 and a director of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce from 1979 to 1985.  Along with his wife of 68 years, Ash is survived by sons
Charles, James and Robert, daughters Loretta Danko and Marilyn
Hanna, plus nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren,
