The U.S. government’s  budget deficit 
widened 10 percent in December as spending rose more quickly
than  tax revenue .  The gap expanded to $86 billion, above the median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, from a $78.1 billion
shortfall in December 2010, according to Treasury Department
data released today in  Washington .  “We are seeing disappointing receipt growth because of a
weak economy, which is unfortunate from a business cycle
standpoint but also bad news for the Treasury,” Mike Englund,
chief economist at Action Economics LLC in Boulder,  Colorado ,
said before the report. “The slower economy, weakening receipts
and a wider federal budget deficit means that there is pressure
to cut spending even further.”  President  Barack Obama  will revive last year’s  deficit 
reduction  proposals  and call for tax increases on the wealthy
and incentives to create jobs in the 2013 budget plan he’ll send
to Congress next month, administration officials said yesterday.
The effort is intended to demonstrate the administration’s
intent to chip away at the deficit, which hit $1.3 trillion in
the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.  Before today’s report, a survey of 27 economists by
Bloomberg News forecast that the December budget deficit would
widen to $83.7 billion. Estimates ranged from a gap of $68
billion to $110 billion.  Budget Deficit  So far in the fiscal year that began in October, the budget
deficit is $321.7 billion compared with $369 billion in the same
period last year.  Spending rose by 3.5 percent in December from a year
earlier to $326 billion, while revenue rose 1.3 percent from a
year earlier to $240 billion.  Individual income tax receipts in the first three months of
this fiscal year rose 5.6 percent to $270.4 billion. Corporate
income tax receipts rose 55 percent to $55.6 billion in the
first three months of the fiscal year.  The non-partisan  Congressional Budget Office  estimated
this week the December budget deficit would reach $84 billion.  “Net payments to  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  climbed by $11
billion because the housing agencies required significantly
larger cash infusions from the federal government than they did
in December 2010,” the CBO said. “Spending increased by
smaller amounts in several other areas.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
