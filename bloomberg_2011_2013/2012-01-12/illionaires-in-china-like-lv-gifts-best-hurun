LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) 
is the favorite brand of Chinese millionaires buying gifts for
friends and business contacts, according to Hurun Report Inc.  About one in seven millionaires will choose to give a
present from Louis Vuitton, Hurun said in survey results
released in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Cartier Ltd. was
the second-most favorite brand, picked by about 1 in 10
respondents, followed by  Hermes International (RMS) , Shanghai-based
Hurun said.  Demand for  luxury goods  in China has risen in line with an
increase in wealth and growth in the world’s second-biggest
economy. The number of millionaire households in the country
climbed 31 percent in 2010 to 1.11 million, ranking China third
behind the U.S. and  Japan , according to a Boston Consulting
Group survey released last year.  “Gift-giving is an essential part of Chinese culture,”
Hurun Report Chairman Rupert Hoogewerf said in the statement.
“The money spent on gifting, especially at Chinese New Year, is
staggering compared with the West.”  Hurun, which also compiles an annual China Rich List,
surveyed 503 mainland Chinese millionaires for the “Top 10
Gifts for the Chinese Luxury Consumer 2012” survey. Each had a
personal wealth of at least 10 million yuan ($1.6 million), with
54 having 100 million yuan or more, the research and publishing
company said.  China had 960,000 individuals with a personal wealth of no
less than 10 million yuan each, Hurun said in a report in April.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) , maker of the 106-proof liquor used by
Mao Zedong’s Red Army to disinfect wounds, ranked fifth and was
the only domestic brand featured.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  placed sixth, the
only U.S. brand and consumer-electronics company on the list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
