Gennady Melikyan, a former first
deputy chairman of  Russia â€™s central bank, and Leonid Melamed, a
former head of telecommunications and oil holding AFK Sistema,
were nominated to the board of state-run lender VTB Group,
 Vedomosti  said, citing Economy Ministry recommendations.  Melikyan left the banking regulator in September, soon
after VTB gained control of the Bank of Moscow, which had
unexpected bad loans, Vedomosti said. The banker denied that was
the reason for his departure, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
