Cia Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo
Pao de Acucar  closed at the highest price in six months after
 Brazil ’s biggest retailer announced strong food sales in the
fourth quarter.  Pao de Acucar  rose  2.1 percent to 69.49 reais in Sao Paulo
trading, the highest since July 5, 2011. The Bovespa benchmark
index  fell  0.1 percent.  Net sales rose 10 percent to 7.2 billion reais ($4 billion)
in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year ago,
while sales in the retailer’s food operations were up 8.7
percent in stores open for more than one year, the São Paulo-
based company said in a regulatory filing today.  “We see this performance as especially good when
considering the deceleration seen in the Brazilian retail
sector,” Banco J. Safra SA analyst Fernando Labes wrote in a
report to clients today. “We believe the strong performance in
food operations, the company’s core business, more than
compensates the mild performance at Globex.”  Sales at  Globex Utilidades SA (GLOB3) , the company’s appliances and
electronics division, rose 4.9 percent in stores open for more
than a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
