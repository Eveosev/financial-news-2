Egypt  has agreed to return licenses
to steel producers that had been revoked by a court order in
return for fees totaling 1.47 billion Egyptian pounds ($240
million),  Al Shorouk  newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  Four companies, including  Ezz Steel (ESRS) , will be allowed to pay
15 percent of the fees up front and the rest over five years,
the Cairo-based newspaper said. The licenses had been revoked
due to irregularities in the awarding process. Ezz will need to
pay 660 million pounds for the two licenses affected by the
ruling, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
