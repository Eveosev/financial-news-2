Encompass Digital Media Inc., a
provider of broadcast services, is seeking $280 million in loans
to back its buyout by Court Square Capital Partners LP,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The financing will include a $250 million  term loan  due in
5.5 years and a $30 million revolving line of credit maturing in
five years, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the terms are private.  Encompass is proposing to pay 6.5 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate on both the term loan and
the revolver, with a 1.5 percent minimum on the benchmark, said
the person.  The debt may be sold to investors at 97 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the borrower and
boosting the yield for investors.  Macquarie Group Ltd. and Bank of Montreal are arranging the
financing for the Los Angeles-based company, said the person.
The banks will host a lender meeting Jan. 18 at 10 a.m. in  New
York .  Court Square is acquiring a majority interest in Encompass
Digital for an undisclosed amount from shareholders including
Wasserstein & Co., according to a Dec. 13 statement distributed
by  Business Wire . Court Square is providing $220 million of
equity for the transaction, said the person.  Trevor Gibbons, a spokesman for New York-based Court
Square, didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
