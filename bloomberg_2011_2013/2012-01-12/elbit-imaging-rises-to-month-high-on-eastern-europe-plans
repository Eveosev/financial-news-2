Elbit Imaging Ltd. (EMIT)  rose to the
highest level in more than a month after co-Chief Executive
Officer Dudi Machluf said the Israeli real-estate company will
bolster investment in eastern Europe.  The shares gained 2.9 percent to 12.80 shekels, or the
equivalent of $3.33, at 10:37 a.m. in  Tel Aviv , reaching the
highest intraday level since Dec. 7.  “We’re looking to duplicate this model and to continue to
focus on real-estate opportunities,” Machluf said yesterday in
a phone interview from Tel Aviv.  Shares of Elbit surged 27.5 percent in New York yesterday
to $3.32 after Blackstone Group LP and DDR Corp. agreed to buy
U.S. shopping centers from a unit of Elbit for $1.43 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
