A ship en route to  Syria  that agreed
to change course to  Turkey  after being detained in fact arrived
in Syria today, state radio CyBC reported without saying where
it got the information.  Chariot, a Russian-owned ship that was carrying ammunition,
was detained by Cypriot authorities on Jan. 9 and released
yesterday, CyBC said. It had agreed to change its destination to
Iskenderun before authorities allowed it to refuel in Limassol,
the Nicosia-based radio station said.  The ship ceased transmitting its automatic recognition
signal yesterday afternoon after it left Limassol, CyBC
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
