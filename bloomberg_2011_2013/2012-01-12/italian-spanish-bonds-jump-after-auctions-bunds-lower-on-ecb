Italian and Spanish bonds jumped as
borrowing costs slid at auctions and the  European Central Bank 
kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged. German debt slipped.  The advance pushed Spanish two-year note  yields  to the
lowest since March. The government sold 10 billion euros ($12.7
billion) of notes, twice the sales target, while Italy auctioned
12 billion euros of bills, easing concern the countries would
struggle to finance their debts. The ECB held its main rate at 1
percent, an outcome predicted by economists in a Bloomberg
survey. German 10-year bunds pared declines as reports showed
U.S. retail sales and jobless claims missed estimates.  “The carry trade, with banks borrowing from the ECB and
then investing in short-term government notes, will continue to
be supportive for Spanish and Italian” debt, said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam.  Italian two-year yields tumbled 50 basis points, or 0.50
percentage point, to 4.22 percent at 2:28 p.m.  London  time,
after sliding to the least since Sept. 9. The 2.25 percent
security due November 2013 climbed 0.810, or 8.10 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 96.72.  The yield on Italian 10-year securities dropped 38 basis
points to 6.60 percent. Bunds underperformed the equivalent
maturities of most euro-region nations including Spain,  Belgium ,
 Austria  and France. Italian bonds narrowed the yield gap over
German securities by 40 basis points to 477 basis points. The
French-German yield spread narrowed 14 basis points to 120 basis
points, and the Belgian yield difference dropped 25 basis points
to 223 basis points.  Italian Bills  Italy’s Rome-based Treasury sold 8.5 billion euros of one-
year debt at a rate of 2.735 percent, the lowest since June and
less than half the 5.952 percent yield at the last sale on Dec.
12. The nation also auctioned 3.5 billion euros of 136-day bills
at 1.644 percent. The government plans to sell debt maturing in
2014 and 2018 tomorrow.  Volatility on Italian sovereign debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by Portuguese securities,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year spreads
and credit-default swaps.  Spanish two-year note yields declined 19 basis points to
2.91 percent after the country sold 9.98 billion euros, twice
the objective, of debt due in 2015 and 2016.  “The auction was very strong, a good start to the year for
 Spain ,” said Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge
Group in London. “People are starting to believe that something
can be sorted out with the debt crisis. For the moment at least
they are trying to make some money out of it.”  U.S. Data  Germany ’s two-year note yield rose two basis points to 0.16
percent after earlier dropping to match its record low of 0.134
percent. The rate on benchmark 10-year bunds advanced two basis
points to 1.83 percent, after climbing as high as 1.85 percent.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said today there are signs of
stabilization in the economy, even as he said there remain
“substantial downside risks” to the euro region’s growth
outlook, repeating a comment from the last meeting on Dec. 8.
German  government bonds  advanced then after policy makers cut
rates and offered banks unlimited cash for three years.  U.S. retail sales rose 0.1 percent in December after a 0.4
percent advance in November that was more than initially
reported, Commerce Department figures showed today. Economists
forecast a 0.3 percent December rise, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Jobless claims climbed by
24,000 to 399,000 in the week ended Jan. 7, Labor Department
figures showed in  Washington . The median forecast of economists
in a separate Bloomberg survey projected 375,000.  Bond Returns  German debt has handed investors a 0.1 percent return this
year, after gaining 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Italian bonds have lost 0.1 percent in 2012,
and Spanish debt fell 0.9 percent, the indexes show.  French two-year note yields dropped to the lowest since May
2010 after  David Riley , head of the sovereign-debt unit at  Fitch
Ratings , said  France  is “not a crisis country.”  Data today showed France’s inflation rate held at a three-
year high in December. Consumer prices rose 2.7 percent from a
year earlier, based on European Union methodology, matching the
rate in November. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast
a 2.5 percent increase.  The French two-year yield dropped 16 basis points to 0.631
percent, after dropping to 0.614 percent. The 10-year yield fell
13 basis points to 3.03 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
