Banco Bradesco SA promoted Joaquim Levy,  Brazil ’s former treasury secretary, to superintendent-
director to run the lender’s asset-management unit, known as
Bram -- Bradesco Asset Management SA.  In March, Levy will replace Denise Pavarina, who was
promoted to co-executive director, according to a spokesperson
for the Sao Paulo-based bank who asked not to be identified in

banking and Bram at Bradesco. Bram hired Levy in June 2010 as
