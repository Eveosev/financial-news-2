Greek natural-gas supplier  Depa 
invited investors  to bid  for a 35 percent stake and management
control in each of three to-be-established regional gas-supply
companies.  The companies, which will distribute and supply natural gas
in three regions of central and northern  Greece  to households,
businesses and industry, should be set up by the end of the
year, Athens-based Depa said in an e-mailed statement today.  To date, Depa has built a gas-pipeline network of 447
kilometers (278 miles) covering three Greek regions that will be
gradually extended to reach 1,300 kilometers and 1 million
households by the end of 2015, according to the statement.  Greece will start the process to sell Depa and its fully
owned gas grid operator Desfa SA by the end of January as part
of a state asset sale and real-estate redevelopment program that
aims to raise 65 billion euros ($83 billion) by the end of 2015,
Costas Mitropoulos, chief executive officer of the Hellenic
Republic Asset Development Fund, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
