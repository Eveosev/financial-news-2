Inflation in  Serbia  will slow to the
central bank’s target range in the first quarter after easing to
7 percent at the end of last year, the National Bank of Serbia
said.  Weaker cost pressures from regulated and food prices, low
aggregate demand and a further decline in inflationary
expectations are the “key disinflationary factors,” the
Belgrade-based bank said today in a statement on its  website .  The central bank said on Dec. 28 inflation will slow toward
4.3 percent, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points at the end of
March. Consumer price growth in December was 7 percent, the
lowest rate since August 2010, compared with 8.1 percent in
November, the Statistics Office reported today.  Slowing inflation may give the central bank room to further
cut  interest rates  after  lowering  borrowing costs six times last
year by a cumulative 2.75 percentage points to 9.75 percent. The
bank aims for an inflation rate of 4 percent, plus or minus 1.5
percentage points, by the end of 2012.  The bank will hold its next policy meeting on Jan. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
