Joseph Yam , former Chief Executive
at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city’s de facto central
bank, spoke to reporters in Hong Kong on the outlook of  China’s
economy  and the European debt crisis. Yam is also an executive
vice president of the China Society for Finance and Banking.  On the outlook for China’s economic policies:  “The market shouldn’t expect China will loosen policy very
soon. China’s prudent monetary policy stance is appropriate. If
they loosen that very soon, I would indeed worry about a
significant slowdown in the economy.”  On the European debt crisis:  “Europe’s problems are very significant, I am very worried
about that. There are signs of improvement in the  U.S. economy 
but in Europe, there are still a lot of problems that haven’t
been resolved.”  Policy makers “need to have a great determination to
support the banking and financial system at all costs. Otherwise
who will have confidence in these financial institutions?  “I can’t see a good solution out there right now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
