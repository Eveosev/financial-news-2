The value of the global carbon
market will increase by about 9.8 percent this year on higher
activity caused by a surge in European Union auctions, said
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The value of traded allowances and credits will advance by
9 billion euros to 101 billion euros ($128 billion) this year
after rising 9.5 percent last year to 92 billion euros, New
Energy Finance said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Volume
jumped 22 percent to 8.2 billion metric tons in 2011.  European carbon permit prices for December have dropped 52
percent in the past year, as the region’s debt crisis weakened
the region’s economy amid rising supply of offset credits from
developing nations. California expects to hold two auctions of
allowances this year, under proposals for its market, which
begins in 2013.  The volume-weighted average global price in 2012 will be
10.40 euros a ton, 7 percent less than 2011, said  Guy Turner ,
director of greenhouse-gas and power research at New Energy
Finance in London. The price drop will be more than offset by an
18 percent surge in volume to 9.6 billion tons, he forecast.  “You’ve got more opportunities for banks to buy into
auctions, to play intermediary roles,” Turner said yesterday.  The European Union, which made up 78 percent of the global
market last year, has started selling allowances rather than
giving them to factories and power stations for free. New Energy
Finance counts these sales as part of its volume numbers. It
doesn’t count allocations granted free of charge.  “We previously warned that excessive volatility in carbon
prices could drive traders out of the market,” Turner said in
the statement. “This hasn’t happened so far. In fact traders
have been more active than ever.”  EU permits for December decreased to a record 6.38 euros a
ton last week in intraday trading on ICE Futures  Europe  in
 London  and closed down 1.3 percent yesterday at 7.04 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
