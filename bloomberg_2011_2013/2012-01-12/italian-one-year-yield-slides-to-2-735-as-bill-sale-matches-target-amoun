Italy  sold 12 billion euros ($15.3
billion) of Treasury bills, meeting its maximum target for the
auction, and its borrowing costs plunged in the country’s first
debt sale of the year.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 8.5 billion euros of one-year
bills at a rate of 2.735 percent. That was the lowest rate paid
on one-year debt at an auction since June and less than half the
5.952 percent offered at the last sale on Dec. 12. Italy also
sold 3.5 billion euros of 136-day bills at 1.644 percent.  Italian bonds extended gains after the sale, with the yield
on the country’s benchmark two-year note falling 69 basis points
to 4.02 percent at 11:42 a.m. Rome time, the lowest since
September. The 10-year yield declined 40 basis points to 6.57
percent, narrowing the  difference  with similar-maturity German
debt to 473 basis points.  The result may help ease investor concern about Italy’s
ability to finance  Europe ’s second-biggest debt, which pushed
the country’s 10-year bond yield above the 7 percent level that
prompted  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek bailouts. Italy’s
auction came after  Spain  sold 9.98 billion euros of bonds
maturing in 2015 and 2016, twice the maximum target of 5 billion
euros set for the sale.  The Italian Treasury faces more than 100 billion euros of
bond and bill maturities in the first quarter, and the auction
result may help shore up demand for three-year and six-year debt
the Treasury sells tomorrow.  Investors today bid for 1.47 times the amount of one-year
bills sold, down from 1.92 times on Dec. 12. The bid-to-cover
ratio on the 136-day note was 1.85.  To contact the reporters on this story:
