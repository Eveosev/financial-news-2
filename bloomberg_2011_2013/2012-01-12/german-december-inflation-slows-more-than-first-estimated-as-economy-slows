Inflation in  Germany ,  Europe ’s
largest economy, slowed more than initially estimated in
December, as a cooling global economy and the region’s debt
crisis damped growth.  The  inflation rate , calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, fell to 2.3 percent from 2.8 percent in November,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. It had
initially reported December inflation at 2.4 percent. In the
month,  prices  rose 0.7 percent. Inflation averaged 2.5 percent
in 2011 from the previous year, today’s report showed.  The  European Central Bank , which aims to keep euro-area
inflation just below 2 percent, lowered its benchmark  interest
rate  by 25 basis points to 1 percent last month and said there
are “substantial downside risks” to the region’s growth
outlook. The German economy may be on the brink of recession
after the statistics office said yesterday that gross domestic
product fell in the fourth quarter of 2011.  “If we see no distortions in energy prices it is
conceivable that the inflation rate comes back under the ECB’s
definition of  price stability  as early as spring,” said Jens Kramer, an economist at NordLB in Hanover, Germany. “The global
economy has entered a somewhat weaker phase.”  Inflation (ECCPEST)  in the 17-member euro region slowed for the first
time in five months in December, to 2.8 percent from 3 percent
in November, according to an initial estimate from the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
