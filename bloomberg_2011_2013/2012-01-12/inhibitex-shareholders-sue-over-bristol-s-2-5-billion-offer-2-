Two Inhibitex Inc. shareholders sued
claiming  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) ’s $2.5 billion buyout offer
undervalues the drugmaker.  Shareholders Charles C. Osborne Jr. and Hortensia Osborne
are asking a judge to bar the proposed transaction. The deal
will prevent Inhibitex shareholders from benefiting from the
company’s long-term prospects, according to the complaint filed
yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court.  “The terms of the merger agreement substantially favor BMS
and are calculated to unreasonably dissuade potential suitors
from making competing offers,” the Osbornes said in the
complaint.  Buying Inhibitex, based in Alpharetta,  Georgia , would give
New York-based Bristol-Myers access to hepatitis C drugs as
companies seek to gain ground in a developing $20 billion
market. Bristol-Myers’s offer of $26 a share was more than
double Inhibitex’s closing price on Jan. 6.  In addition to a no-solicitation clause, the merger
agreement includes a $75.9 million termination fee, “further
locking up control of the company in favor of BMS,” the
Osbornes said in the complaint.  Inhibitex Chief Executive Officer Russell Plumb didn’t
immediately return a phone call and e-mail seeking comment on
the complaint.  The case is Osborne v.  Inhibitex Inc. (INHX) , CA7169, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
