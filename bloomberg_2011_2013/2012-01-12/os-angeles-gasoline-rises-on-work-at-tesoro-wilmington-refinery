California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  strengthened by the most in three weeks after  Tesoro
Corp. (TSO)  was said to be performing work on two units used to make
the fuel at the  Wilmington (SHWCCRUD)  refinery in  Southern California .  Carbob in Los Angeles jumped 4.25 cents to a premium of 8.5
cents a gallon against gasoline futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 3:34 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery of the fuel rose
1.05 cents to $2.8163 a gallon.  San Antonio-based Tesoro is conducting a short maintenance
turnaround on an isomerization unit, which improves the octane
level of gasoline, and a benzene saturation unit, two people
familiar with the work said. The 97,000-barrel-a-day refinery
may flare gases through Jan. 18, the company said in a
regulatory filing yesterday.  “The notification is a precaution in anticipation of
potential flaring associated with planned maintenance,” Tina
Barbee, a Tesoro spokeswoman in  San Antonio , said in an e-mail.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  may also flare gases at the 150,000-
barrel-a-day  Torrance (XOTOCRUD)  refinery in Southern California through
Jan. 15 as the plant recovers from two external power failures
earlier this week, according to a notice from the Irving, Texas-
based company to the  South Coast Air Quality Management
District .  Carbob in  San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  was unchanged at a discount of 2.25
cents, its lowest level since Aug. 16.  California  gasoline inventories  climbed 2.7 percent to 6.7
million barrels in the week ended Jan. 6, state Energy
Commission data show.  Diesel supplies  jumped 19 percent to 4.05
million barrels, the state said.  Diesel Falls  California-blend diesel in  San Francisco (DIEISCAD)  fell for the first
time in six days, dropping 3.12 cents to a premium of 2.88 cents
a gallon against Nymex heating oil futures. The same fuel in  Los
Angeles (DIEILCAD)  declined 0.75 cent to a premium of 4.75 cents.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon , fell
2 cents to a premium of 3.5 cents against gasoline futures.  Gasoline inventories  on the West Coast, known as the Padd 5
region, rose 5.4 percent to 30.2 million barrels in the week
ended Jan. 6 from a week earlier, the highest level since
