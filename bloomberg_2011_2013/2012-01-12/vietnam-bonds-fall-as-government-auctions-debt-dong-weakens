Vietnamese bonds fell as the
government sold 1.88 trillion dong ($89 million) of debt after
the  State Bank  of  Vietnam  signaled it may reduce borrowing costs
later in the year. The dong weakened.  The central bank will adjust policy rates to more suitable
levels, to help ease the average level of market  interest rates ,
Governor Nguyen Van Binh said yesterday. The State Treasury sold
1 trillion dong of three-year bonds and 880 billion dong of
five-year bonds today, according to a statement posted on the
Hanoi Stock Exchange’s website.  “Banks bought bonds at the auction this time after the
governor indicated that interest rates may come down after the
first quarter,” said Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a fixed-income
trader at Hanoi-based Ocean Commercial Joint-Stock Bank.  The  yield  on the five-year note gained two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 12.46 percent, according to daily
fixing prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong fell 0.1 percent to 21,035 per dollar as of 5:35
p.m. local time, according to data from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828 per
dollar, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
