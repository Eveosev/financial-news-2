Fidelity Investments , the second-
biggest U.S. mutual-fund company, named Mark Flaherty to the
newly created position of chief investment officer of fixed-
income in the U.K. as it expands its bond unit.  In his new role, Flaherty will be based in  London  and
report to Charlie S. Morrison, president of the bond unit, the
Boston-based company said today in a statement. Fidelity,
through its mutual funds and its Pyramis institutional division,
manages more than $835 billion in bonds and money funds
worldwide, the firm said.  Fidelity’s fixed-income unit is adding the position after
starting new products last year, including the Fidelity
Conservative Income Bond Fund, Fidelity Global High Income Fund
and the Fidelity Defined Maturity Funds, a series of four
municipal-bond offerings. In November, the firm named  Robert Brown  as head of its bond group in the U.S., appointed Nancy Prior as president of money markets and David Hamlin as head of
research for fixed-income.  “Mark’s appointment reinforces our commitment to expanding
our global capabilities in non-U.S. dollar securities analysis
and  portfolio management ,” Morrison said in today’s statement.  Flaherty was previously Fidelity’s managing director of
research for municipals, a group he headed since 2005. Fidelity
managed about $1.5 trillion in assets as of Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
