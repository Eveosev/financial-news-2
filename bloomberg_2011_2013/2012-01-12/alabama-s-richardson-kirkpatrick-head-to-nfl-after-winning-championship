University of Alabama  running back
Trent Richardson and cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick said they will
enter this year’s  National Football League  draft, three days
after winning college football’s national championship.  Richardson and Kirkpatrick, both juniors, announced their
decision to skip their remaining college eligibility at a news
conference today. The pair helped Alabama capture its second
Bowl Championship Series title in three years with a 21-0 win
over Louisiana State.  Richardson was one of five finalists for the Heisman Trophy
after rushing for 1,679 yards and 21 touchdowns for the Crimson
Tide this season. He’s rated the top running back available,
according to  ESPN’s Scouts Inc.  and draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr.
projects him as the third overall pick.  Kirkpatrick is rated as the No. 2 cornerback available
behind LSU’s Morris Claiborne, who  ESPN reported  today will not
return to school after winning the Jim Thorpe Award as college
football’s best defensive back.  Alabama  had four players selected in the first round of
last year’s NFL draft.  The deadline for underclassmen to declare for this year’s
NFL draft is Jan. 15. Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III
of Baylor University declared for the draft yesterday, while
Stanford University quarterback  Andrew Luck , who is projected as
the top overall pick, also said he won’t return to school.  To contact the reporter on this story:
