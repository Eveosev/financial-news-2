Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
may cut the 2012 budget by as much as 70 billion reais ($39.1
billion) early next week as part of a plan to ensure the central
bank will continue to reduce interest rates,  Correio Braziliense 
reported today without saying how it obtained the information.  Rousseff estimates the benchmark  interest rate  may be
reduced to 10.5 percent from 11 percent next week if the
government shows its commitment to the 2012 fiscal target, the
Brasilia-based newspaper said. Rousseffâ€™s team sees room for
borrowing costs to be lowered to 9 percent this year, Correio
reported.  The  Finance Ministry  declined to comment in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
