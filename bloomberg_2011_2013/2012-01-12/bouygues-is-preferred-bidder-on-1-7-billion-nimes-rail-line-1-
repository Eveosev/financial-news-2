Bouygues SA (EN) , France’s second-largest
construction company, was named the preferred bidder for a
French railroad-construction contract valued at about 1.3
billion euros ($1.7 billion).  The agreement with railroad operator Reseau Ferre de France
is part of an investment totaling 1.86 billion euros in the
Nimes-Montpellier rail bypass project in the country’s south,
RFF Chairman Hubert du Mesnil said in Paris today.  The group led by Paris-based Bouygues includes  Alstom SA (ALO) 
and Spie Batignolles Technologies. Bouygues beat  Vinci SA (DG) ,
Europe’s biggest builder, for the project.  Vinci was picked by RFF in 2010 to build, maintain and
operate a high-speed rail line between Tours and Bordeaux that
will need 7.8 billion euros of investment. In 2011, RFF chose
 Eiffage SA (FGR)  to build and maintain a high-speed line between Le
Mans and Rennes, in western France, that will need a 3.4
billion-euro investment.  The final contract should be signed before the French
presidential election in April, du Mesnil said. The rail line
should be completed in 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
