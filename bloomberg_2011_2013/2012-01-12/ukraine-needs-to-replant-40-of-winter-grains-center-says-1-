Ukraine will need to replant 40
percent of winter grain in spring because of damage caused by
adverse weather, said Tetiana Adamenko, head of the national
weather center’s agro-meteorology department.  “We are concerned that there are no forecasts of a
significant solid snow pack,” Adamenko said. There will be snow
in western and northern parts of the country, Adamenko said.  Frosts are expected and temperatures will be minus 10 to 15
degrees Celsius (5 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit) for between Jan. 10
to Jan. 20, Adamenko said. Some 70 percent of winter grain
plants isn’t fit to survive such temperatures for more than
three days without snow, according to the meteorologist.  The condition of the country’s winter grains didn’t
deteriorate in December and early January, according to the
national weather center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
