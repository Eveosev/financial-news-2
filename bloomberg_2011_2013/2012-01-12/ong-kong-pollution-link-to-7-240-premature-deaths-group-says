Roadside pollution in  Hong Kong ,
which benchmarks itself against a 25-year-old air standard,
contributed to about 7,240 premature deaths from 2005 to 2011, a
public think tank said, citing data from an environmental index.  High nitrogen dioxide levels are linked to the deaths, the
Hong Kong-based  Civic Exchange  said in a  statement  today, citing
data from the  Hedley Environmental Index,  which uses a peer-
reviewed methodology to indicate the public health impact of air
pollution.  “Given the high number of avoidable deaths, we are very
troubled by the lack of urgency by the administration to tackle
air pollution head-on,” said Mike Kilburn, head of
environmental strategy for the group.  The Hong Kong government hasn’t updated its  air quality 
objectives since 1987 and its standard of measurements is less
strict than the  World Health Organization ’s. The government
yesterday said it will measure pollutants smaller than 2.5
micrometers at all its monitoring stations by March, a week
after Beijing pledged to make similar data publicly available.  An estimated 528,388 hospital bed days, and 49.26 million
doctor visits “can be attributed to Hong Kong’s persistently
poor air quality” during Hong Kong Chief Executive  Donald Tsang ’s term of office from 2005, the Civic Exchange said.  The Hong Kong government is retrofitting some buses with
devices to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, and it’s also
working with the government in the nearby Chinese province of
Guangdong to reduce ozone concentrations in the region, the
city’s environmental protection department said in an e-mailed
statement today in response to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
