United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s
largest aluminum producer, said its smelters can turn a profit
should prices fall to $1,900 a metric ton, while as much as 45
percent of Chinese capacity may already be running at a loss.  “Our smelters can work with $1,900 a ton,” Vladislav Soloviev, first deputy chief executive officer, said in an
interview, published on Moscow-based Rusal’s Facebook page.
“It’s difficult, but it can work. If it goes lower, well then
we may see cutbacks.” Some of Rusal’s smelters are viable with
an aluminum price as low as $1,400, he said.  Aluminum traded at $2,193 a ton on the London Metals
Exchange today. The metal has advanced 7 percent since Jan. 1
after falling about 27 percent last year from its May 3 peak of
$2,797.  China  should shut more capacity, Soloviev said, and help
drive prices higher.  “In  Russia , we have a lot of social issues to consider,
and it’s not a good time to make cuts,” he said. “But the
world, and China particularly, has room for more cuts.”  Some 40 percent to 45 percent of Chinese smelters may be
operating at a loss, he said.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) ,  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  and their global rivals are
cutting production after the slump in prices. Alcoa, the largest
U.S. producer, reported its first loss in two years this week,
and said China may use 70 percent of its capacity in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
