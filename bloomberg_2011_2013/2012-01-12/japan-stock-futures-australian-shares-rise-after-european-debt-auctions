Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities rose after Italian and Spanish borrowing
costs fell following debt auctions, adding to optimism the
 European Central Bank ’s cash injection is averting a credit
crunch in financial markets.  American depositary receipts of  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s
second-largest carmaker by market value, rose 0.9 percent from
the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Mizuho Financial
Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-biggest bank by market value, gained
0.3 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 miner by
market value, advanced 1.5 percent in Sydney after metal prices
increased for a fifth day.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 8,410 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,380 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,410 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.5
percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.2 percent in
Wellington.  Once concern about Europe’s debt crisis is “lifted at
least in the short-term, we should see some good performance in
Asian equity markets,” said Diane Lin, a  fund manager  with
Sydney-based fund Pengana Capital Ltd., which manages about $1.1
billion in global assets. ECB policy makers “have stabilized
the whole situation. There’s a lot of bonds to be issued by
European governments in the short-term. It is important for them
to be able to refinance all those papers.”  Economic Stabilization  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index added 0.2 percent in New York yesterday
after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said there
were signs of stabilization in economic activity.  Spanish two-year rates fell to the least since March after
the nation raised 9.98 billion euros ($12.8 billion) from a note
auction, twice the maximum target. Italy’s two-year yields fell
to the lowest since September as the nation sold 12-month bills
at a yield of 2.735 percent, down from 5.952 percent at the
previous auction.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 3 percent gain by the  S&P 500 
and a 2 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.3 times for the S&P 500
and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. fell for a second day,
led by solar companies, after a report showed inflation in 2011
exceeded the government’s target, lowering the probability for
further stimulating measures to spur growth. The Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index also slid after the U.S. reported a higher-
than-forecast increase in jobless claims. The benchmark gauge
lost 0.3 percent to 100.32.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum rose 2.2 percent
yesterday, its fifth straight daily gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
