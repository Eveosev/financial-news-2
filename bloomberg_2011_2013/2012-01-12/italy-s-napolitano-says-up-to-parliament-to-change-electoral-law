Italy’s political parties and the
parliament must “propose and adopt changes to the current
electoral law” according to the needs expressed by Italians,
President Giorgio Napolitano said in an e-mailed statement.  Italy’s Constitutional Court today rejected a possible
referendum on changes to the country’s electoral law. Napolitano
met with in Rome Parliament speakers Gianfranco Fini and Renato Schifani after the decision, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
