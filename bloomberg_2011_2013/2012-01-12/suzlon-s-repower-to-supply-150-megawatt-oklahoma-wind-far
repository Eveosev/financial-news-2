Repower Systems SE (RPW) , a German unit of
 India ’s wind-turbine maker  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , won an order to
supply a 150-megawatt project in  Oklahoma .  Repower signed a contract with a U.S. project developer it
didn’t identify to supply 73 of its 2.05-megawatt machines,
Hamburg-based Repower said today in an e-mailed statement.  It’s the company’s “second-largest U.S. project to date,”
Andreas Nauen, chief executive of Repower, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
