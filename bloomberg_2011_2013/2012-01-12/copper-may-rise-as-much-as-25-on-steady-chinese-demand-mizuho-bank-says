Copper prices may gain as much as 25
percent in the second half of this year on steady demand from
 China , the world’s top consumer, amid tight supplies, according
to  Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd (MIZC) .  Prices of the metal, used in pipes, tubes and wires, will
climb to as high as $9,500 a metric ton from last year’s close
of $7,600, said Yuka Kageyama, a commodity derivatives analyst
at the bank, a unit of Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s
second-largest bank by assets.  The London Metal Exchange LMEX Index of six primary metals
including copper and aluminum, fell 22 percent last year, the
first drop in three years, as Europe’s debt crisis widened.
Yields on two-year Greek debt surged to 152 percent last month,
compared with 0.29 percent for Treasuries of a similar maturity.
China’s inflation cooled to a 15-month low and producer-price
gains were the smallest in two years in December, leaving the
government more room to support growth.  “The European debt-crisis issues will be the key for most
commodities this year,” Kageyama said in an interview yesterday.
“We expect that China may ease its monetary policies in the
first half and  Europe ’s problems may recede later this year,
paving the way for a rally among base metals as supplies will
remain tight.”  LME Stockpiles  Dwindling stockpiles at LME warehouses will also provide
support for copper, she said. Prices may decline as low as
$6,500 a ton with an average price of $7,950 for 2012, the bank
said in a January note to clients.  Orders to draw copper from LME warehouses, or canceled
warrants, gained 24 percent to 50,000 tons on an increase in  New
Orleans . Inventories of the metal slipped 0.3 percent to 364,250
tons, the lowest level since Dec. 22, 2010, according to
exchange data yesterday.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.6
percent to $7,830 a ton at 3:43 p.m. Tokyo time. The metal
declined 21 percent last year and averaged $8,164.50.  China’s central bank may reduce reserve ratios in the first
half, Helen Zhu, a strategist at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , said
yesterday. China’s copper imports rose to a record last month as
Lunar New Year stockpiling and financing needs spurred buying.  Copper will average $7,750 a ton in 2012 and $7,313 in 2013,
 Michael Widmer , head of metals research at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, said in a weekly note on Jan. 9. The metal will
average $3.83 a pound ($8,444 a ton) in 2012 and $4.08 in 2013,
 Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd ., said in a note yesterday.  China Smelters  For aluminum, output cutbacks, concern over China’s power
supply and higher  oil prices  will lend support and may push the
metal as much as 19 percent higher to $2,400 a ton this year
from the end of last year. Production costs for aluminum are
estimated at between $2,000 and $2,200 a ton, she said.  Chinese aluminum smelters may idle their annual capacity by
one-third, the most in three years, as energy costs soar and
prices slump. The country may produce almost 20 million tons and
its capacity may be as much as 30 million tons by the end of
this year, said Luo Rongjin, a Beijing-based analyst with Bocom
International Holdings Co. Monthly output from China, the
world’s biggest producer, fell 8.3 percent in November from a
record 1.6 million tons in August.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) ,  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  and their global rivals are
cutting production after prices dropped 19 percent last year,
curbing profits. Alcoa, the largest U.S. producer that reported
its first loss in two years this week, said China may use 70
percent of its capacity in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
