Burundiâ€™s government plans to
increase its agriculture budget to boost  food production  in the
East African nation, Renouveau reported, citing Gervais
Rufyikiri, the second vice president.  Spending will increase to 45.9 billion francs ($33.4
million) in 2012 from 43.2 billion francs last year, the state-
owned Bujumbura-based newspaper said.  The state will also provide a 2 billion-franc subsidy to
the Strategic Food Security Fund, which will be used to provide
loans to farmers, and plans to expand palm-oil plantations and
irrigation projects in the country, it said.  Funds have also been set aside to help purchase 5,500
metric tons of fertilizers for growers, Renouveau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
