U.S. stocks pared losses as gains in
raw-material and industrial shares helped the market recover
from an earlier slump after disappointing data on jobless claims
and retail sales.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index fell less than 0.1 percent
to 1,291.95 at 12:32 p.m. New York time, after dropping as much
as 0.5 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
