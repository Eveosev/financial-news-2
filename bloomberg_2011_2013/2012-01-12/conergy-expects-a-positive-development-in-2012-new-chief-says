Conergy AG (CGYK) , the German solar panel
maker owned by creditors since July, expects a “positive
development” in 2012 as it seeks to grow in  Asia , new Chief
Executive Officer Philip Comberg said.  Conergy appointed its chairman, Comberg, as CEO today,
filling a position vacant since October 2010. He will remain in
the chief’s post until Dec. 31, the company said in a statement.  The Hamburg-based company is in “constant intensive talks
with numerous suppliers from Asia” to source the best possible
prices, Comberg, a former Solarfun Power Holdings Co. board
member who speaks Chinese, said today in a conference call.  Conergy, once  Germany ’s largest solar company, in November
posted a third-quarter loss bigger than its market value at that
time as prices and demand fell at home. The company said in
September that it would cut 100 jobs, halt production of wafers
and cells and focus on the end-product modules, project
development and solar energy-related services.  Conergy  shares  rose 1.6 percent to 38.5 euro cents a share
at the close of Frankfurt trading, valuing the company at about
61.5 million euros ($79 million). The stock has risen 22 percent
this year.  The company generated about 70 percent of its sales in
 Europe  and 18 percent in Asia after the first nine months of
2011, said Comberg, a former investment banker for Deutsche Bank
AG. Asia is the company’s “fastest-growing market,” after a 60
percent increase in that period, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
