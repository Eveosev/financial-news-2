European Union carbon permits
advanced to their highest close this year, as the profits
achievable by power stations using coal rose from their lowest
since July 18.  EU permits for December rose 2 percent to close at 7.19
euros ($9.23) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the highest since Dec. 30. Carbon permit prices have
lost 45 percent in the past six months amid concerns that the
 European Investment Bank ’s sales of 300 million 2013 allowances
will further boost oversupply in the market. The EIB sold 12
million permits through Dec. 29 from Dec. 5, the bank said
yesterday in its first report on the program.  Rising profits from coal burning can boost the incentive to
sell power forward. The profit for a German power station
burning coal next year rose 4.8 percent today to 8.99 euros a
megawatt-hour, according to a dark-spread calculator on
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
