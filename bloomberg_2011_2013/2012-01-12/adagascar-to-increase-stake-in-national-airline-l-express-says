Madagascar plans to increase its
stake in Air Madagascar this month at a cost of 24 billion
ariary ($10.7 million)  l’Express de Madagascar  reported, citing
people it didn’t identify.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s government will boost its
share in the carrier to 93.7 percent from 89.5 percent, the
Antananarivo-based newspaper reported on its website. The
injection of funds will enable the airline to be better equipped
for its reorganization, l’Express said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
