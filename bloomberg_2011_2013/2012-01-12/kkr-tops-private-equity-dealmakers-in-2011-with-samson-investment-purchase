KKR & Co. , the private-equity
company run by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , was the most
active buyout firm last year, followed by Bain Capital LLC, Apax
Partners LP,  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and  Carlyle Group .  KKR invested $18.8 billion and was involved in 44 private-
equity deals, London-based researcher Preqin Ltd. said in a
research  report  today. By comparison, Boston-based Bain deployed
$15.3 billion across 33 transactions in 2011, including the
October takeover of Tokyo restaurant operator Skylark Co. for
$3.4 billion.  KKR executed the biggest private-equity deal of 2011 when
it agreed to buy closely held Samson Investment Co., the Tulsa,
Oklahoma-based oil and gas producer, for $7.2 billion. The
acquisition was the New York-based firmâ€™s largest since it
bought the U.S. Foodservice unit of Royal Ahold NV for $7.1
billion in 2007.  The volume of private-equity deals last year increased 29
percent from 2010 to $448 billion as access to credit continued
to improve following the financial crisis, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. This year, the industry is defending
itself from attacks by rivals of Republican presidential
candidate  Mitt Romney , who say the former Bain Capital chief
executive officer enriched himself at the cost of corporations
and their employees while running the firm from 1984 to 1999.  Apax, based in London, invested $13.5 billion in 26 deals
last year, and New York-based Blackstone deployed $11.7 billion
across 39 deals, Preqin said. Carlyle, the Washington-based firm
preparing to go public this year, invested $10.6 billion in 47
deals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
