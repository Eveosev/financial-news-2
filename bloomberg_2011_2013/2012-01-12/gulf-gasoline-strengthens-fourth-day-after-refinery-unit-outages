Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened for
a fourth straight day after gasoline-making units shut for
repairs and stockpiles decreased in the region.  Gasoline  inventories  in the Gulf Coast states fell 991,000
barrels, or 1.3 percent, to 74.9 million barrels last week,
according to the Energy Department.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  shut a catalytic cracker and alkylation unit
at the Alliance refinery in Louisiana,  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said in an e-mail Jan. 9.
Catalytic crackers at Conoco’s Sweeny plant in Texas and
Marathon Petroleum Corp.’s Garyville, Louisiana, refinery also
shut, according to Lipow.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed 1 cent to 1.75 cents a gallon versus futures
traded at noon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 3.06 cents to
$2.7664.  Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery shut
a diesel hydrotreater for repairs and will idle a crude unit
Jan. 17 and a coker March 1 for work, two people with knowledge
of the operations said Jan. 9.  Houston-based Motiva is a joint venture of Royal Dutch
Shell Plc and Saudi Arabian Oil Co.  The premium for the same fuel in New York Harbor rose 0.5
cent to 1.88 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
