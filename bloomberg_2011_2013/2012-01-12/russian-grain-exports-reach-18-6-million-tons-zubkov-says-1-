Russia has exported 18.6 million
metric tons of grains so far in the current marketing year,
First Deputy Prime Minister  Viktor Zubkov  said.  Winter-crop losses are forecast at 6.2 percent as winter
grains are harvested from 15.1 million hectares (37.3 million
acres), Zubkov said in Moscow today. Winter crops were sown on
16.1 million hectares in total, he said. The marketing year
started July 1.  Spring sowing is targeted at 30.3 million hectares, or 0.7
percent more than last year, Zubkov said at a meeting of the
government’s agriculture commission.  “Taking into account there was a good base founded last
year and the government plans to support farmers further, it
seems to me the next crop may exceed the one of the last year,”
Zubkov said.  Russia harvested 93.9 million tons of grains in 2011 after
drying and cleaning, according to preliminary government figures
reported yesterday by Moscow-based agricultural researcher
SovEcon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
