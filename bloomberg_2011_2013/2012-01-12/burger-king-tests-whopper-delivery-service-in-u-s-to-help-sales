Burger King Holdings Inc. (BKC) , the
operator of 7,500 fast-food restaurants in the U.S. and  Canada ,
is trying out delivery service at some stores in Virginia and
 Maryland  as a possible way to boost sales.  “We are currently testing the service to bring this
convenience to the U.S.,” Kristen Hauser, a spokeswoman for
Burger King, said in an e-mail. The Miami-based chain will
expand its test to 16 locations from four by Jan. 23, she said,
declining to say whether the service will be offered nationwide.  Available from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., deliveries cost $2 and
there is a minimum order of $8 to $10, depending on the market,
according to Burger King’s  website . The restaurant, whose rivals
include  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  and Wendy’s Co., is delivering meals
such as 40-piece chicken tenders and two bottled drinks for
$10.99 and four large sandwich combos for $23.99.  Customers can order online or via phone. Burger King
doesn’t deliver fountain drinks, milkshakes, coffee and
breakfast foods, Hauser said.  3G Capital Inc., a New York-based private-equity firm,
bought Burger King for about $3.93 billion in 2010. Revenue rose
1.4 percent to $608.1 million in the three months ended Sept.
30, compared with the year before, according to a company
 filing .  To contact the reporters on this story:
