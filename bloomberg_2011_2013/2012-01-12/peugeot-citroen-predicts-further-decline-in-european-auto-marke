PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest carmaker, predicted that the region’s auto market
will continue to decline in the wake of the sovereign-debt
crisis after its car sales on the continent slipped in 2011.  Peugeot sold 6.1 percent fewer vehicles in Europe last year
and its market share fell 0.9 points to 13.3 percent as the 207
model “came under stiff competition,” the Paris-based carmaker
said today in a statement. Peugeot’s worldwide sales declined
1.5 percent to 3.5 million vehicles even as the auto market
expanded by 3 percent, it said.  The carmaker “reminds us what can, and most likely will,
go wrong in 2012,” Erich Hauser, a London-based analyst at
Credit Suisse, said in a note.  Demand from  emerging markets , led by  Russia  and  Latin
America , helped Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin counter
Peugeot’s sales decline in Europe. The manufacturer plans to
generate half of its sales on other continents by 2015, up from
42 percent in 2011. It also intends to fight back by introducing
four new models and six restyled vehicles this year.  Peugeot is seeking to boost the value of it brands by
focusing on more expensive cars after increasing the proportion
of “premium” vehicles to 18 percent in 2011 from 13 percent a
year earlier, it said. The upmarket models include the Citroen
DS line and the Peugeot 508.  The  automaker’s stock  has plummeted 56 percent in six
months, compared with a 22 percent decline for smaller French
competitor  Renault SA. (RNO)  The shares were up 1 percent at 13.09
euros in Paris trading at 9:59 a.m., giving Peugeot a market
value of 3.06 billion euros ($3.89 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
