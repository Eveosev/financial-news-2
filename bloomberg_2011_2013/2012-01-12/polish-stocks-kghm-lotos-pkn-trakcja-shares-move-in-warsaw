Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  climbed 35.99,
or 1.7 percent, to 2,166.99 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
the highest close in more than a week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper and
silver producer, jumped 7.5 percent to 123.6 zloty, advancing
for a third day. The government’s standing committee approved
proposals for a new tax on extraction of the metals after the
Finance Ministry lowered the maximum limit of the levy.  Separately, copper rose after Spain sold twice as much debt
as planned and Italy’s borrowing costs fell, easing concern that
euro-region governments might struggle to fund their debts.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  , Poland’s biggest oil company, rose
1.8 percent to 34.6 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the
second-largest refiner, added 2.2 percent to 21.8 zloty. Oil
rose from the lowest settlement in almost two weeks in New York
on concern that a strike in Nigeria and the threat of sanctions
against Iran’s nuclear program will curb crude supplies.  Trakcja-Tiltra SA (TRK)  , Poland’s biggest publicly
traded rail construction company, climbed 2.9 percent to 1.05
zloty, extending this week’s advance to 48 percent. Its Poldim
SA unit won agreement from five creditors to suspend until Feb.
28 their demands for immediate loan repayment while they
consider allowing the company to restructure its debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
