New Zealand ’s dollar touched a two-
month high as a report showed China’s inflation cooled for the
fifth straight month in December, increasing speculation the
Asian nation will provide more monetary stimulus.  The so-called kiwi held a three-day gain versus the
greenback and the yen before data that may show U.S. retail
sales grew, supporting demand for riskier assets. The Australian
dollar was little changed as Spain and Italy prepared to auction
debt this week amid concern  Europe ’s fiscal crisis is worsening.  “I think inflation is still cooling and that’s going to
provide scope for Chinese authorities to support markets and the
economies more,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist
at Westpac Banking Corp. in  Singapore . “Both the Aussie and
kiwi still continue to do quite well against the  U.S. dollar .”  New Zealand’s currency gained to 79.81 U.S. cents, the
highest since Nov. 9, before trading at 79.65 at 1:42 p.m. in
Sydney, little changed from yesterday’s close in  New York . It
earlier rose to 61.35 yen, also the most since Nov. 9, before
changing hands at 61.243 yen from 61.25.  Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0304 from $1.0310 yesterday
and fetched 79.21 yen from 79.24. It was at 80.98 euro cents
from 81.14 yesterday, when it reached a record high of 81.20.  China’s consumer prices  rose  4.1 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing today.
That compares with the median estimate of 4 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey and 4.2 percent in November. The People’s
Bank of  China  in November cut the amount of cash that lenders
need to set aside as reserves, the first reduction since 2008.  Sales at U.S. retailers probably  climbed  0.3 percent in
December, following a 0.2 percent gain in November, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists
before the Commerce Department issues the figure today.  Spain will sell bonds due in 2015 and 2016 today. Italy
will auction bills today and debt due in 2014 and 2018 tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
