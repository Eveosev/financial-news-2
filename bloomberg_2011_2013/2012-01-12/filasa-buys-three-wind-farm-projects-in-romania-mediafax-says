French closely-held company Filasa
International bought three wind farm projects with a total
capacity of 400 megawatts in  Romania , Mediafax reported.  Filasa may start construction work at the wind farms
located in Braila County, in the southeast of the country, at
the end of 2013 or beginning of 2014, the Bucharest-based news
service said, citing the companyâ€™s local lawyer Ernest-Virgil
Popovici as saying. He declined to name the sellers of the
projects or give the transaction price.  The three projects will require an investment of about 800
million euros ($1 billion), according to Mediafax calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
