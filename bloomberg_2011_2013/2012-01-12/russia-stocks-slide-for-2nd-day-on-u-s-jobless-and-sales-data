Russian stocks  erased gains, falling
for a second day, after U.S. reports showed more Americans than
forecast filed for  unemployment benefits  and retail sales rose
less than anticipated.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 0.1 percent to 1,464.53 by
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, erasing an earlier advance of as
much as 1.3 percent. OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil pipeline
monopoly operator, sank 3.5 percent while  OAO Sberbank (SBER03) , the
nation’s biggest lender, lost 0.8 percent. The dollar-
denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  added 0.4 percent to 1,458.24.  U.s. Labor Department figures today showed jobless claims
climbed by 24,000 to 399,000 last week, higher than the median
forecast of 46 economists in a Bloomberg News survey of 375,000,
curbing appetite for riskier assets. The MSCI Emerging Markets
Index pared gains after the data was published. Sales at U.S.
retailers in December rose less than forecast, restrained by
cheaper fuel prices and holiday discounting.  The Russian market “depends on global factors,” Alexander Branis, Moscow-based chief investment officer at  Prosperity
Capital , which manages about $5 billion in assets in Russia and
the former  Soviet Union , said by phone today. “It’s hard to say
if the bounce will continue.”  Russian stocks have rallied 4.4 percent this year, compared
with a 4.1 percent gain for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Cheapest BRIC  The Micex trades at 5.5 times analysts’ earnings estimates
for member companies, the lowest among the so-called BRIC
nations, which include  Brazil , India and  China . The index
plunged 17 percent in 2011, compared with an 18 percent slide
for Brazil’s Bovespa index, which trades at 9.4 times estimated
earnings according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai
Composite Index trades at 9.3 times estimated earnings, and the
BSE India Sensitive Index has a ratio of 14.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum producer,
added 1.5 percent to 209.05 rubles.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN) ,
which also produces copper, advanced 2 percent to 5,357 rubles.  Metals including copper and nickel rose in  London  as
figures showing Chinese inflation cooled to a 15-month low fed
speculation the government may have room to ease monetary policy
in an effort to spur growth.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Gavin Serkin  To contact the reporters on this story:
