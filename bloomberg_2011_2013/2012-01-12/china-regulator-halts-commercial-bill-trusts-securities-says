China’s banking regulator told
domestic  trust companies  to halt the sale of products that
invest in commercial bills, the  Shanghai Securities News 
reported today, citing a person it didn’t identify.  The  China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRZ)  notified trust
companies about the suspension by phone yesterday and hasn’t
issued a formal notice, the Chinese-language newspaper reported
on its website. The practice may be a way of skirting the
government’s lending curbs, the report said.  Chinese banks, constrained by the government’s loan quotas,
have been helping their clients to raise funds by arranging
trust plans that buy commercial bills from them, according to
the report.  The average expected rate of return on products sold after
October rose to 7.55 percent, 94 basis points higher than those
set up earlier last year, when businesses’ funding difficulties
increased, the report said, citing data from Benefit Wealth, a
Chengdu, southwestern China-based company that monitors the
sales.  A phone call to the CBRC’s Beijing-based media office went
unanswered.  Reuters also reported the suspension late yesterday.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Linus Chua, Andreea Papuc  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
