Japan ’s central bank and financial
regulator told U.S. authorities that the Volcker Rule
restricting proprietary trading would hamper the market for
Japanese  government bonds , according to a letter released today.  The proposed rule limiting banks’ ability to buy and sell
securities for their own accounts would increase the cost of
trading Japanese government bonds, the Financial Services Agency
and Bank of Japan wrote in the letter dated Dec. 28.  “Some of the Japanese banks might be forced to cease or
dramatically reduce their U.S. operations,” the central bank
and FSA said in the letter to officials including  Mary Schapiro ,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Those
reactions could further adversely affect liquidity and pricing
of the JGBs.”  The agency and central bank asked that the rule be amended
to expand exempted securities “substantially” to include the
country’s  sovereign debt .  They also urged the U.S. to refrain from applying the
restrictions overseas, or to consider amending them to exclude
foreign joint ventures or subsidiaries that are controlled by
non-U.S. banks.  The proposed rule, named for former Fed Chairman  Paul Volcker , was included in the Dodd-Frank Act to limit the kind of
risky trading that helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis.
Regulators are seeking public comment on the proposal and may
make changes before its scheduled effective date of July 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
