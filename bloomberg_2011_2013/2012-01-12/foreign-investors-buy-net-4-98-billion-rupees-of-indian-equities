Overseas  investors  bought a net  4.98
billion rupees  ($96.1 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
taking their investment in the equities this year to 19.5
billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 26.3 billion rupees of shares and sold
21.3 billion rupees, according to data from the Securities &
Exchange Board of  India . They bought a net 16 billion rupees of
bonds, raising total inflow into debt this year to 101.1 billion
rupees, the data  show .  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , the
second worst annual loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  India’s $1.1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among
the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led
to the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds  have placed 4.463 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.308 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993. They invested 421 billion rupees in bonds
last year.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
