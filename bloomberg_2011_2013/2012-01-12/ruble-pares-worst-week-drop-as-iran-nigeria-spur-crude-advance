The ruble strengthened against the
dollar, reversing yesterday’s loss, as the threat of oil-supply
disruptions lifted the price of  Russia ’s main export earner.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.8 percent to 31.5530 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, after losing 0.7 percent
yesterday, the steepest decline since Jan. 5. The ruble weakened
0.3 percent to 40.45 per euro and added 0.2 percent to 35.5566
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Crude futures gained 1.7 percent to $102.56 a barrel in  New
York  after a Nigerian union said it started shutting platforms
in Africa’s biggest crude producer and  Japan  said it may reduce
petroleum imports from Iran. Oil and natural gas account for
about 17 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product and almost
50 percent of budget revenue.  The ruble “is being supported by two factors, firstly by
the elevated oil price which has come on the back of tensions
with  Iran ,” Dina Ahmad, an emerging-markets strategist at BNP
Paribas SA in  London , said by e-mail. “Secondly, the central
bank appears to be providing less liquidity through its repo
operations in the past few days.”  Bank Rossii provided 11 billion rubles ($347 million) to
lenders in a repurchase auction yesterday, according to  data  on
its website, compared with daily totals as high as 943 billion
rubles in December. Larger repo injections weaken the currency
as the availability of cash on the market increases.  Outflows, Protests  Investors pared bets the Russian currency would depreciate,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 32.0183 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 32.1513
per dollar yesterday. Russia’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds due
2020 rose, pushing the yield down eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 4.42 percent.  Spain and  Italy  sold a total 22 billion euros ($28 billion)
of debt at lower borrowing costs today, a sign concern over
 Europe ’s crisis may be easing. The European Union is Russia’s
largest trading partner.  Russia’s capital outflows almost tripled last year to $84.2
billion, the central bank said on its website today, as the
ruble slid the most since 2008. In the fourth quarter $37.8
billion left the country, the data show. Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin previously forecast $80 billion of outflows in 2011 at a
government meeting Dec. 27.  Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Moscow in
December amid allegations of fraud in parliamentary elections
Dec. 4. Russia may see net inflows of as much as $20 billion
this year as investors repatriate funds after presidential
elections in March, Ahmad said.  “We were looking for another quite sizeable figure for
December, given the elections and protests,” BNP’s Ahmad said.  The ruble has strengthened 1.9 percent against the dollar
so far in 2012.  Brazil ’s real has appreciated 3.3 percent,
 India ’s rupee gained 2.6 percent and  China ’s yuan weakened 0.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
