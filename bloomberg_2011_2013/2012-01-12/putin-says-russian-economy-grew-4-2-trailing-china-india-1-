Russia, the world’s largest energy
exporter, grew faster than all major economies except for  China 
and  India  last year, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said.  Gross domestic product advanced 4.2 percent, up from 4
percent in 2010, Putin said at a government meeting in Moscow
today. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said last month growth
may be as high as 4.5 percent for 2011.  Putin, who presided over average growth of about 7 percent
a year during his 2000-2008 tenure as president, wants faster
expansion as he seeks to return to the Kremlin in a March 4
election. Russia must grow 6 percent to 7 percent annually to
become one of the world’s five largest economies within five
years, Putin said last month.  “Let’s remember that 2012 won’t be easy and more likely
just the opposite,” he said. “The worrying signals coming from
leading world economies should keep us working diligently to
protect the interests of our people.”  Russia  is the “leader” on fiscal health, with the federal
 budget surplus  at 0.8 percent of GDP, Putin said. State debt was
at 10.4 percent of economic output last year, compared with more
than 80 percent for the euro area, he said.  Inflation (RUCPIYOY)  “remains high” even after slowing to to 6.1
percent last year, the lowest annual rate since the collapse of
the  Soviet Union  in 1991, the premier said. Industrial output in
Russia grew 4.7 percent last year, putting Russia in fourth
place among the leading economies, behind China, India and
Germany, Putin said.  Putin, 59, said he wants to create 25 million well-paid
jobs over the next two decades as Russia seeks to modernize an
economy still reliant on Soviet-era infrastructure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
