Delhaize Group SA (DELB) , the owner of Food
Lion supermarkets, plans to cut about 5,000 positions and
expects a 2.4 percent drop in revenue as it closes stores in
the U.S. and Europe.  Costs related to the closures will hurt  earnings  by about
205 million euros ($261 million) starting in the first quarter,
the Brussels-based company said in a statement today. Closing
146 outlets and converting 64 others will cut the number of
shops by about 4.3 percent and initially lower revenue by about
500 million euros, or 2.4 percent, Delhaize said.  “We are disappointed in the fourth-quarter revenues in the
U.S. and Belgium,” Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Olivier Beckers said in the statement. “Consumers continued to feel
pressured in the fourth quarter due to the macro-economic
environment and this led to a reduction in spending. We also
encountered an increase in competitive activity.”  Consumers continue to be hurt by high levels of joblessness
in the U.S. and  Europe . The U.S. unemployment rate, which
was 8.5 percent in December, may continue to curb spending
in the world’s largest economy, where Delhaize gets most of
its revenue.  Delhaize fell as much as 7.6 percent in Brussels trading,
the biggest drop in five months, and was down 7.4 percent at
43.38 euros at 9:16 a.m. That extended the stock’s decline in
the past year to 21 percent, compared with a 13 percent slide
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  U.S. Charges  Delhaize expects to record an impairment charge of about
120 million euros in the fourth quarter of 2011, which is
related solely to the U.S. operations.  The store closures and conversions will have an “annual
positive effect” on operating profit of 35 million euros to
40 million euros after completion, said Delhaize.  Beckers said Delhaize will improve its “price
competitiveness” this year.  The food retailer will close 113 Food Lion, seven Bloom and
six Bottom Dollar Food locations in the U.S., it said. The
remaining 42 Bloom shops as well as 22 Bottom Dollar Food stores
will be turned into Food Lion outlets.  Twenty stores in southeastern Europe will also be closed.
Delhaize gets most of its revenue in the U.S., where it got 68
percent of its total 2010 sales of 20.9 billion euros, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In its home market of  Belgium ,  the company , in addition to
supermarkets, operates a home delivery service and started to
offer online shopping, according to its annual report.  Growth Forecast Cut  Belgium’s central bank last month reduced its forecast for
economic growth in 2012 to 0.5 percent, in line with the latest
prediction by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.  In last year’s fourth quarter, Delhaize’s revenue increased
by 7 percent at identical exchange rates and by 7.6 percent at
actual rates, the company said. The “difficult global macro-
economic environment” hurt sales performance across the group,
it said.  Delhaize ended 2011 with a network of 3,408 stores,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
