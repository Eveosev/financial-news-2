Henning Kreke, chief executive of
Douglas AG, plans to team up with a financial investor to take
over the company,  Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The founding Kreke family plans to take the company private
and sell the books and jewelry businesses of Douglas to focus on
the perfumery unit, the newspaper said.  The plans may fail as Erwin Mueller, who owns 10 percent of
Douglas, may not agree and instead buy more shares himself, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
