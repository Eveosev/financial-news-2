Top-seeded  Caroline Wozniacki  is
“very hopeful” of playing at the Australian Open, which begins
in four days, following a scan on her injured wrist, the Women’s
Tennis Association said.  Wozniacki, a 21-year-old Dane, had her left wrist taped in
the final set of her 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 loss to Agnieszka Radwanska
at the Sydney International last night. A scan at a Sydney
hospital today showed “some inflammation” but “no major
damage,” the WTA said.  “She’s heading to Melbourne this evening and will continue
to have treatment and is very hopeful of playing at the
Australian Open,” WTA spokeswoman Eloise Tyson said in an e-
mail.  The year’s first Grand Slam tournament starts Jan. 16 at
 Melbourne  Park.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
