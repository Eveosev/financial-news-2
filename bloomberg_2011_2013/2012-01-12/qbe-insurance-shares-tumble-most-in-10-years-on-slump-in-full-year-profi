QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE)  shares
tumbled the most in more than 10 years in Sydney after the 125-
year-old company said 2011 profit fell as much as 50 percent on
record natural disaster claims and bond losses.  Profit after tax for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 dropped 40
percent to 50 percent from 2010, Sydney-based QBE said in a
statement today. Its insurance profit margin, a key measure of
performance, was 7 percent to 7.5 percent, down from the 11
percent to 14 percent forecast in August.  QBE has been battered by a surge in catastrophe claims for
natural disasters including Hurricane Irene, floods in
Queensland state,  Thailand ’s deluge, and earthquakes in  New
Zealand . Chief Executive Officer Frank O’Halloran, 64, has
announced 44 acquisitions valued at $7.61 billion since taking
over in January 1998, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
more than half of which were U.S.-based.  “There won’t be too many brave investors stepping in to
catch this falling knife,” Peter Esho, Sydney-based chief
market analyst at City Index Ltd., a London-based provider of
trading services in bonds, stocks and commodities, said in a
note. “The number of catastrophes in such a short period of
time have finally caught up to hurt the group’s bottom line.
Many will now question the tone of management who only a few
months ago was sounding very optimistic.”  The  shares  tumbled 13 percent to A$11.35 in Sydney, the
most since September 2001 and to the lowest since May 2004.  QBE’s second-half dividend will likely be 25 Australian
cents a share, down from 66 cents a year earlier, cutting the
total 2011 payout 32 percent to 87 cents.  Disastrous Year  A record level of disasters raised the large individual
risk and catastrophe claim allowance to around 15 percent of net
earned premiums, up from 13 percent estimated in August,
according to today’s statement. That’s $1.21 billion higher than
2010, it said. QBE’s  net income  in 2010 dropped to $1.28 billion
from $1.53 billion a year earlier.  “While catastrophes in the second half of 2011 have
attracted fewer headlines than those earlier in the year, the
frequency of events continued at an unprecedented level,”
O’Halloran said in the statement.  He cited  Hurricane Irene  and tornadoes, wildfires, hail,
flood, wind and snow storms in the U.S., as well as bush fires
in Western Australia state, storms in Melbourne, floods and
riots in  Europe , and the extreme floods in Thailand.  “What a disaster,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage
about $1 billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. “My sense is
that their acquisitions in the U.S. are of a lot lower quality
than their core businesses were before.”  Profit Margin  Unrealized losses on its fixed-income investments were
about $160 million for 2011 due to rising credit spreads,
according to the statement. Unrealized losses from the drop in
risk-free rates used to discount outstanding claims provisions
were approximately $200 million, it said.  O’Halloran, now in his 14th year as CEO of QBE, said today
he aims to increase the insurance profit margin to “around 15
percent” this year through increased premiums, reinsurance and
“other changes to our business and current interest yields.”  After expanding under O’Halloran into offshore markets such
as  North America , the company founded in 1886 in north
Queensland as a one-man business had operations in 49 countries
and over 14,000 employees in 2010, according to its annual
report. The company switched to reporting in U.S. dollars in
2010, a year in which over 70 percent of its premiums were
generated in currencies other than the Australian dollar.  Credit-default swaps on QBE surged 45 basis points to 405
basis points as of 2 p.m. in Sydney, according to Deutsche Bank
AG. That’s set for the biggest daily increase since Oct. 5, CMA
data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
