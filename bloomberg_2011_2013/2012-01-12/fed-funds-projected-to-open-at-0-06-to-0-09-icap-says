October 2012 to April 2013. The operation is part of the Fed’s
replacement of $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio
with longer-term Treasuries to reduce borrowing costs further
and counter risks of a recession.  The central bank plans to sell $8 billion to $8.75 billion
of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
