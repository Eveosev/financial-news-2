Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s largest oil
company, sold the first corporate bonds from the euro-region’s
periphery in more than a month after its government’s successful
debt auction.  The 750 million euros ($957 million) of seven-year
securities were priced to yield 292 basis points more than the
benchmark swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The spread was cut from an initial range of 300 to 310 basis
points, according to a banker involved in the transaction who
declined to be identified because the information is private.  Repsol’s issue follows Spain’s 10 billion-euro sale of
bonds today, double the government’s target, signaling
improvement in investors’ perception of the credit quality of
the country.  Spain ’s auction included three-year notes priced to
yield 3.384 percent on average, down from 5.187 percent at a
Dec. 1 sale of similar-dated securities.  Repsol’s “deal will pay a premium of at least 32 basis
points versus Spanish  government bonds , which is attractive,”
said Christophe Herpet, a  fund manager  at AXA Investment
Managers in Paris, which put in an order for some of the notes.
“I’m expecting more peripherals to come.”  Kristian Rix, a spokesman for Repsol in Madrid, wasn’t
available to comment.  Swaps Rise  The cost of insuring against default on Repsol debt rose 14
basis points to a three-week high of 175, according to CMA
prices of credit-default swaps. An increase in the contracts
indicates deterioration in the outlook for  credit quality .  Credit-default swaps on European sovereign debt fell to a
two-week low, with the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index
of contracts on 15 governments dropping 13 basis points to 355.
Swaps on Spain dropped 21 basis points to 392, the lowest since
Jan. 2, according to CMA.  Repsol has 750 million euros of floating-rate notes coming
due next month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
bonds pay a coupon equivalent to the quarterly euro interbank
offered rate plus 25 basis points. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  “The new-issue concession is in the low 20 basis-point
area and to get a print of 292 is a great result,” said
Philippe Bradshaw, head of Europe corporate syndicate at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London , one of the banks that
managed the sale. The proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes, he said.  Bank of America Corp.,  Barclays Capital , HSBC Holdings Plc,
 Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and Societe Generale SA also handled the
transaction.  The oil company’s securities due 2017 fell 0.9 percent to
102.56 cents on the euro to yield 4.18 percent as of 4:33 p.m.
in London, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Madrid-based Repsol offered a spread of 250 basis points
when it sold 850 million euros of bonds due 2016 on Dec. 5, the
last deal by a non-financial company from the euro area’s most-
indebted countries, Societe Generale SA data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
