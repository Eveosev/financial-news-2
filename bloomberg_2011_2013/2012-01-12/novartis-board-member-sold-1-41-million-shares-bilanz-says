Novartis AG (NOVN)  board member Pierre
Landolt sold 1.41 million shares in the Basel, Switzerland-based
drugmaker, Bilanz reported today, disputing a report that it was
the chairman and citing a person familiar with the transaction.  A report in Blick on Dec. 21 said Novartis Chairman  Daniel Vasella  sold shares worth 73.2 million francs ($77 million).  Eric Althoff, a spokesman for Novartis, didnâ€™t immediately
return a call and e-mail today seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
