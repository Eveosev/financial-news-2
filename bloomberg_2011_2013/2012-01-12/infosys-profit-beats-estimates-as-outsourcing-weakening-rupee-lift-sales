Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , India’s second-largest
software exporter, reported third-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as customers outsourced more work and the
rupee’s decline boosted the value of repatriated earnings.  Net income  rose 33 percent to 23.7 billion rupees ($458
million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, from 17.8 billion
rupees a year  earlier , Bangalore-based Infosys said today. That
compares with the 22.8 billion-rupee median of 44 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Infosys shares fell after the company cut its full-year
forecast for sales in dollar terms, citing weaker growth in
developed economies including  Europe , which together with  North
America  accounts for more than 80 percent of revenue. The
company joins  Accenture Plc  in posting better-than-expected
quarterly earnings as clients outsource information-technology
services to reduce costs.  “They beat some estimates because of forex, not because of
improvements in their core business,” said Pralay Kumar Das, an
analyst at Elara Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “What the market
looks at though is the future.”  Infosys dropped as much as 7.7 percent, the largest
intraday decline since Nov. 11, and traded 7.4 percent lower at
2,618.50 rupees as of 9:16 a.m. in Mumbai. The stock was the
biggest contributor to the the benchmark  Sensitive (SENSEX)  index’s 0.6
percent decline.  Dollar Sales Outlook  The company, which designs software programs, maintains
computers and provides IT and outsourcing services for clients
including BT Group Plc, said sales in the year ending March 31
will range from $7.029 billion to $7.033 billion, down from the
$7.08 billion to $7.2 billion it forecast in October.  “The global economy, driven by slower growth in developed
markets coupled with the European crisis, could impact the
growth of the IT industry,” Chief Executive Officer S.D. Shibulal said in the earnings release.  Sales in the fourth quarter may range between $1.806
billion and $1.810 billion, Infosys said today.  The company raised its outlook for sales in rupee terms.
Full-year revenue will range from 342.7 billion rupees to 342.9
billion rupees, higher than the October projection of 335
billion rupees to 340.9 billion rupees.  The rupee’s 7.7 percent decline against the dollar in the
three months ended Dec. 31 would have boosted margins at  India ’s
software exporters, Pratik Gandhi, an analyst at IDBI Capital
Markets Services Ltd. in Mumbai, said before the earnings were
released.  Third-quarter  revenue  rose 31 percent to 93 billion rupees,
exceeding the 91.7 billion-rupee median of 48 analyst estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
