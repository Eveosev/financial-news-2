Most Asian  stocks  fell, with a
regional benchmark index snapping three days of gains, as weaker
 Japan  trade data added to evidence of a global slowdown, damping
speculation slower inflation in China may result in looser
monetary policy.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, fell 2.3 percent as the nation’s current-account
surplus shrank. Infosys Ltd., India’s second-largest software
exporter, tumbled after cutting its sales forecast.  QBE
Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE)  plunged 13 percent in Sydney after saying
2011 profit dropped as much as 50 percent. China Communications
Construction Co., a builder of transport infrastructure, gained
1.6 percent in  Hong Kong .  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  dropped 0.1 percent to 116.14
as of 7:57 p.m. in Tokyo, with five shares falling for every
four that rose. The gauge advanced 1.7 percent in the past three
days amid bets that  China  will ease monetary policy. The  MSCI
Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  gained 0.3 percent, erasing
losses of as much as 0.2 percent.  “If inflation keeps coming down, it increases the
likelihood that China will deem it appropriate to continue to
ease monetary policy,” said Will Seddon, who helps oversee $300
million at White Funds Management in Sydney. “The market has
largely digested the possibility of a recession in  Europe .”  Regional Indexes  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped less than 0.1
percent after swinging between gains of 0.8 percent and losses
of as much as 0.5 percent as the nation’s inflation cooled for a
fifth straight month in December. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
fell 0.3 percent, having swung between gains and losses at least
seven times.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average slipped 0.7 percent.
Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  lost 0.2 percent, with QBE
Insurance as the main drag, according  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  South Korea’s Kospi Index advanced 1 percent and the BSE
 India  Sensitive Index dropped 0.9 percent as Infosys declined.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.5
percent today after falling as much as 0.2 percent. The gauge
was little changed in  New York  yesterday. The U.S. economic
expansion improved last month across most of the country, while
hiring was limited and housing remained stagnant, the  Federal
Reserve  said in its Beige Book business survey.  Japanese exporters slid as the nation’s current-account
surplus shrank 86 percent from a year earlier as slowing growth
in China and Europe and the appreciation of the yen damped
demand for Japanese products.  Japan’s Exporters  Sony, the maker of Bravia televisions and PlayStation game
consoles, dropped 2.3 percent to 1,319 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
the world’s biggest carmaker by market value, declined 1.2
percent to 2,595 yen. Panasonic Corp., a maker of home
appliances, slid 2.5 percent to 628 yen.  Infosys sank 8.4 percent to 2,588.25 rupees, the biggest
drag on the Asia-Pacific gauge. The company reduced its full-
year forecast for sales in dollar terms, citing weaker demand in
developed economies including Europe.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 2.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 2.8 percent advance by the
S&P 500 and a 2.2 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.2 times
 estimated earnings  on average, compared with 12.3 times for the
 S&P 500  and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  QBE Insurance tumbled 13 percent to A$11.35 in Sydney, the
biggest decline on the regional benchmark index. The company
said 2011 profit fell as much as 50 percent on record natural
disaster claims and losses on bond investments.  ‘Falling Knife’  “There won’t be too many brave investors stepping in to
catch this falling knife,” Peter Esho, Sydney-based chief
market analyst at City Index Ltd., a London-based provider of
trading services in bonds, stocks and commodities, said in a
note. “The number of catastrophes in such a short period of
time have finally caught up to hurt the group’s bottom line.”  Chinese construction companies and machinery makers
advanced after China’s inflation cooled to a 15-month low and
producer-price gains were the smallest in two years in December,
leaving the government more room to support growth as a global
slowdown hurts exports.  China Communications Construction increased 1.6 percent to
HK$6.81.  Zoomlion Heavy Industry & Technology Ltd. , a maker of
construction machinery, added 0.7 percent to HK$9.50.  Solar energy producers surged after the China said it plans
to start developing 3 gigawatt of solar power capacity in the
five years through 2015.  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , a Chinese producer of
polysilicon used in solar panels, jumped 14 percent to HK$2.49.
 Trony Solar Holdings Co Ltd. (2468) , a panel maker, climbed 6.5 percent
to HK$1.15.  OCI Co., a South Korean supplier of polysilicon, surged 15
percent to 255,000 won in  Seoul , the most on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index. Unit OCI Solar Power said it plans to build 400
megawatts of solar energy projects for CPS Energy in Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
