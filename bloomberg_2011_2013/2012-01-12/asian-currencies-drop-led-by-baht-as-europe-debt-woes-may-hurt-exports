Asian currencies weakened, led by
 Thailand ’s baht, as concern a sovereign-debt crisis will pull
 Europe  into a recession dimmed the outlook for exports.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY)  dropped for a
second day and the baht sank to a 17-month low. The MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of  shares  declined as Spain and Italy prepare to
sell more debt amid credit-rating concerns. Data today is
forecast to show industrial output in the euro region shrank for
a third month in November.  “Concern over Europe’s debt crisis is intensifying, making
it hard for investors to take risks,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a
researcher at the Japan Center for Economic Research in  Tokyo .
“Such concern also hurts the outlook for Asian exports,
weighing on currencies.”  The baht slid 0.3 percent to 31.85 per dollar as of 4:03
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Philippine peso lost 0.1 percent to 44.045 while South  Korea ’s
won closed little changed at 1,158.20.  Industrial production in the euro region contracted  0.3
percent  in November from the previous month, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey before the European
Union’s statistics office releases the figures.  The  European Central Bank  will keep its benchmark  interest
rate  at  1 percent  at a policy meeting today, a separate survey
showed. Ewald Novotny, an ECB governing council member, said on
Jan. 10 there’s a risk of a “mild recession” in the euro area.  Debt Sales  Spain will auction as much as 5 billion euros ($6.4
billion) of bonds due 2015 and 2016 today, while Italy is
scheduled to sell 12 billion euros of bills.  Fitch Ratings 
lowered its rating outlook for  France  in December and put  Spain 
and Italy on review for a downgrade.  “Ahead of big events like auctions in Italy and Spain and
also the central bank’s rate meeting at home, traders don’t want
to go for sizable positions,” said Lee Jung Hyun, a Seoul-based
currency dealer at Industrial Bank of Korea.  The rupiah fell as much as 0.7 percent to 9,225 per dollar
as Bank Indonesia kept its  reference rate  at 6 percent at its
policy meeting today, a move predicted by 13 of 18 economists in
a Bloomberg survey. Five had forecast a cut to 5.75 percent.  The won earlier fell as much as 0.2 percent. The Bank of
Korea is expected to keep its benchmark rate at 3.25 percent for
a seventh month at its policy meeting tomorrow, based on all 14
estimates in a Bloomberg poll.  China  Inflation  Reports this week showed Malaysia’s exports and industrial
production grew in November at the slowest pace in four months,
while Philippine exports dropped for a seventh month. China and
Taiwan released December trade figures showing the smallest
gains in shipments since 2009.  China’s yuan weakened for a seventh day, the longest losing
streak since 2006, as government data today showed inflation
slowed for a fifth month. The currency declined 0.04 percent to
6.3178 per dollar, contributing to a 0.38 percent loss since
December. A 0.48 percent drop in August 2010 was the biggest
monthly slide since January 1994.  Consumer prices rose 4.1 percent in December from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing
today. That compares with the median estimate of 4 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of 26 economists and a gain of 4.2 percent
in November.  India  Production  India’s rupee strengthened as a government report showed
industrial production increased 5.9 percent in November from a
year earlier, rebounding from a 5.1 percent drop in October.
Economists forecast 2.1 percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey.
The currency rose 0.2 percent to 51.7875 per dollar.  “I’m not as bearish on India now as I was in November,”
said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a strategist in  Singapore  at Westpac
Banking Corp. “Growth is not a huge concern, and if the
inflation story can improve then it will be a good opportunity
to buy the rupee.”  The  Reserve Bank  of India sold $2.92 billion of foreign
currencies in November as the rupee slumped, according to data
published by the central bank on its website. That compares with
sales of $943 million in October.  Elsewhere, the Malaysian ringgit declined 0.1 percent to
3.1440. Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$30.002, after
earlier touching NT$29.88, the strongest level since Nov. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
