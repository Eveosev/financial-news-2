Meyer Burger Technology Ltd. (MBTN) ,
 Europe ’s biggest maker of solar-panel equipment, rose the most
in five months in Zurich trading amid optimism that stronger-
than-expected demand at the end of 2011 will continue.  Meyer Burger climbed 9.2 percent to 17.25 Swiss francs a
share after China said it plans to start developing 3 gigawatts
of new solar capacity as part of a target to raise installations
to 15 gigawatts in 2015. It was the Swiss company’s steepest
one-day gain since Aug. 9.  Germany installed 3 gigawatts of solar panels in December,
the most in a single month, driving the world’s largest solar
market to 7.5 gigawatts of capacity installed in 2011.  “I’m pretty bullish on demand in 2012,” Aaron Chew, a
Maxim Group LLC analyst in  New York , said in an interview. “If
pricing remains the same, I see 30 gigawatts this year and 40
gigawatts next year” of new solar installations worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
