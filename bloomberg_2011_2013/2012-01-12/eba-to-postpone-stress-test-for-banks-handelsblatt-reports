The European Banking Authority will
this year postpone the annual  stress test  for banks usually
published in July,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing a spokeswoman
for the EBA.  The test will be delayed to allow time for banks to get
fresh capital to fill gaps documented by the last stress test in
December, the newspaper said. The test may be postponed to the
autumn or not happen at all this year, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
