Philippine bonds gained, pushing
yields to a three-week low, on speculation the central bank will
cut borrowing costs for the first time in two years next week as
inflation cools. The peso weakened.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will lower its benchmark rate
to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent on Jan. 19, according to all
six economists in a  Bloomberg News survey . The central bank may
ease monetary policy this quarter as inflation slows, Governor
Amando Tetangco said this week. The monetary authority’s
overnight borrowing rate was last reduced in July 2009.  “Expectations of a rate cut as early as this month are
supporting bonds,” said Dave Estacio, assistance vice president
at First Metro Investment Corp. in  Manila .  The yield on the 5.75 percent bond due October 2021 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.16 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services. That’s the lowest
level since Dec. 20.  The inflation rate dropped to an 11-month low in December
as gains in food and utility costs slowed.  Consumer prices  rose
4.2 percent from a year earlier, after a 4.8 percent increase in
November, the  National Statistics Office  said Jan. 5.  Bangko Sentral kept its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged
at 4.5 percent for a fifth meeting in December after two
increases in 2011. It also raised the  reserve requirements  for
banks twice last year, bringing the ratio to 21 percent.  The peso weakened as concern a sovereign-debt crisis will
pull  Europe  into a recession dimmed the outlook for the region’s
exports. The currency lost 0.1 percent to 44.045 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
