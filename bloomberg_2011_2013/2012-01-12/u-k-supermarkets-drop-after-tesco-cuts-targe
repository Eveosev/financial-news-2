U.K. supermarkets fell in  London 
trading after  Tesco Plc (TSCO) , the country’s largest grocery chain,
said profit growth would be “minimal” in its next fiscal year.  Tesco shares fell 16 percent, the most since at least
September 1988, to 323.45 pence in London.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY) , which said yesterday that third-quarter
same-store sales rose 1.2 percent, excluding fuel and value-
added tax, fell 5.4 percent to 285.9 pence.  William Morrison
Supermarkets Plc (MRW) , the smallest of the U.K.’s four main food
retailers, dropped 6 percent to 285.9 pence.  Morrison said on Jan. 9 that sales growth slowed over
Christmas as competitors fought harder for business, and
forecast that 2012 will be tougher than last year.  Ocado Group Plc (OCDO) , the U.K.’s largest online-only grocer,
rose 33 to 74 pence after saying sales increased 16 percent in
the Christmas season.  Cheshunt, England-based Tesco said it expected “minimal”
growth in its next fiscal year as it invests in discounts and
struggles in a tough U.K. consumer environment.  U.K. sales at stores open at least a year fell 2.3 percent,
excluding fuel and value-added tax, in the six weeks ended Jan
7., Tesco said. That was worse than the median estimate of 10
analysts compiled by Bloomberg for a 1 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
