ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. (2688) , the gas
supplier making a joint bid for China Gas Holdings Ltd., fell
the most in more than 1 1/2 years on concern that it may need to
increase its offer after investors raised stakes in the target.  The  shares  fell 8.1 percent to close at HK$22.05, the
biggest decline since June 2, 2010. China Gas advanced 0.8
percent in Hong Kong to HK$3.70, while the benchmark  Hang Seng 
index fell 0.3 percent.  China Gas, which distributes natural gas in 20 Chinese
provinces, rebuffed a HK$15.3 billion ($2 billion) hostile
takeover offer by ENN Energy and China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. on Dec. 14. South Korean investment group SK Holdings Co.
and Fortune Oil Plc increased their stakes in the company this
week, filings with the  Hong Kong  Securities and Futures
Commission show.  “Since SK wants to increase its stake, there’s more
concern among investors that ENN may have to raise its bid,”
said Kenny Cheung, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Core Pacific-
Yamaichi International Ltd. “The market won’t welcome ENN
Energy raising the bid from the current price,” he said.  Fortune Oil bought 11.1 million shares of China Gas over
the past two days, according to the filings. SK E&S Co., a unit
of SK Holdings, acquired 2.16 million shares on Jan. 10, the
company said in a filing.  SK E&S plans to spend as much as 120 billion won ($104
million) to buy additional China Gas shares, Reuters reported
today, citing an unidentified spokeswoman for SK Holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
