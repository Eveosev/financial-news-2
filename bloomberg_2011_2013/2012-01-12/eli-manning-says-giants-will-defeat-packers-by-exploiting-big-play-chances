Eli Manning said he knows his  New
York Giants  will have big-play opportunities against the  Green
Bay Packers ’ league-worst defense in this weekend’s playoff
game. It will be up to his offense to take advantage.  While the Packers scored more points than any team in the
 National Football League  this season, no club surrendered more
total yards (411.6) and more passing yards (299.8) than the
defending Super Bowl champions.  Manning, 31, led the NFL in pass completions of 40 yards or
longer this season, and connected with Hakeem Nicks for a 72-
yard touchdown that all but sealed a 24-2 win over the  Atlanta
Falcons  in the first round of the playoffs. The Packers defense,
meanwhile led the NFL in interceptions.  “They try to make some big plays so they give up a few
plays,” Manning told reporters yesterday. “We have to
capitalize when we have opportunities to hit big plays, but be
smart and don’t turn the ball over.”  The Giants (10-7) visit the Packers (15-1) on Jan. 15 and
are 7 1/2-point underdogs in the last of this weekend’s four
playoff matchups, which feature all eight of the NFL’s division
winners for the second time since the league realigned in 2002.  While the Packers gave up a lot of yards -- many of them
after opposing teams fell behind and were forced to pass in an
effort to catch up -- their defense has also been opportunistic.
 Green Bay ’s 31 interceptions this season were eight more than
the next-closest teams, the New England Patriots and San
Francisco 49ers.  “They do a good job of mixing up some different pressures,
different looks,” Manning said. “They do a good job of
everybody getting involved, everybody getting their hands on the
ball, being aggressive with the defensive backs. They run around
and play fast so they get opportunities.”  Last Meeting  Manning passed for 347 yards and three touchdowns in the
Giants’ 38-35 home loss to the Packers on Dec. 4. His
counterpart,  Aaron Rodgers , passed for 369 yards, four scores
and led the last-minute drive that set up Mason Crosby’s 30-yard
field goal as time expired.  Nicks said he isn’t concerned if this weekend’s game turns
into another high-scoring shootout.  “I’m pretty confident in our offense, our running game,
the way Eli is throwing the ball right now and the way the wide
receivers are playing,” Nicks said.  Defensively, the Giants say they’ve improved since last
month’s meeting between the teams.  In their playoff opener, the Giants didn’t allow the
Falcons’ offense to score for the first time in 73 games. New
York held Atlanta to a season-low 247 yards and now faces a
Green Bay offense that led the NFL with 35 points a game.  Packers’ Loss  Giants safety Antrel Rolle said the first game tape he
watched this week was of the Packers’ lone loss this season, a
19-14 defeat against  Kansas City  on Dec. 18.  “They attacked them defensively, they were very
physical,” Rolle said of the Chiefs. “They were more physical
than Green Bay on that given day, and they won the game.”  Defensive end  Jason Pierre-Paul  said the key will be for
Giants pass-rushers to play physical, get pressure on Rodgers
and prevent him from running and making plays out of the pocket.
Pierre-Paul had 16 1/2 sacks this season for the Giants, who
tied for third in the NFL in that category and now have  Justin Tuck  and Osi Umenyiora back after injuries.  “It is going to be a tough challenge with Jason, Tuck, Osi
and those guys,” Rodgers said. “They all offer their own
difficulties when you try to block them and protect. It is going
to be important to try to slow those guys down a little bit and
for us to win those one-on-one matchups.”  Green Bay Winners  The Giants won their last playoff trip to Green Bay,
beating the Packers in the National Football Conference
championship after the 2007 season before upsetting the Patriots
in the  Super Bowl . The Giants peaked at the right time that
season, and Manning said he thinks this team is showing similar
improvement.  “We have to take advantage of this opportunity, it’s hard
to get here,” Manning said. “We have guys healthy. We have
people in the right positions doing good things. It’s just a
matter of everybody coming together and continuing to play our
best football during this time of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
