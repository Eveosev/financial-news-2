(Corrects to show  iron ore  also moves from other ports in
third paragraph of story published Jan. 11.)  Australia, accounting for 41 percent
of global seaborne exports of iron ore, shut its main ports
handling the commodity because of an approaching cyclone.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s second-largest exporter of the
raw material, halted loading at Dampier and Cape Lambert,
spokesman Gervase Greene said today. Port Hedland, from which
BHP Billiton and  Fortescue Metals Group (FMG)  ship iron ore, remains
closed after ships were sent away yesterday, Lindsay Copeman,
the  port’s  harbor master, said by phone today.  All vessels at berth or at anchor awaiting loading at the
port moved about 40 nautical miles offshore, Copeman said. Of
the 12 berths at Port Hedland,  BHP Billiton (BHP)  operates from six
and Fortescue from two, according to Copeman. The three ports
account for 94 percent of the nation’s exports, according to
Macquarie Group Ltd.  Shipments from the world’s largest exporter of iron ore
were an estimated 481 million metric tons of 1.2 billion tons of
global trade last year, according to the Australian government
forecaster,  Bureau  of Resource and Energy Economics.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
