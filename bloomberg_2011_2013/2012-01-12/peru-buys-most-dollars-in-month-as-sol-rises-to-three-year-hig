Peru ’s central bank made its biggest
dollar purchase in a month after the sol rose to a three-year
high amid optimism Europe’s debt crisis isn’t worsening.  The central bank  bought  $244 million in the spot currency
market today, the most since Dec. 1, to stem gains in the sol.
The bank paid an average 2.6920 soles per dollar, it said on its
website.  The currency rose less than 0.1 percent to 2.6920 per U.S.
dollar at today’s close, from 2.6930 yesterday, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Peruvian commercial banks sold dollars as European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said he saw signs of stabilization
in the region and yields fell at Spanish and Italian debt
auctions. Local banks bought dollars last month amid concern
 Europe ’s debt turmoil might derail the global economy.  “We’ve started the year with a better international
environment, which probably led to a reduction in the high level
of” local banks’ dollar holdings, said  Mario Guerrero , an
economist at Scotiabank Peru.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.73 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.19 centimo to
114.13 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
