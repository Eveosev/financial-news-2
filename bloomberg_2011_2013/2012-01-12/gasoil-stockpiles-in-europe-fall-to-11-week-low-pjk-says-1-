Gasoil stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, dropped to the lowest level in 11 weeks on exports,
according to PJK International BV.  Gasoil inventories decreased for a third week, falling 5.2
percent to 1.84 million metric tons in the week to today,
according to PJK, a researcher in the Netherlands. That’s the
least since Oct. 27 as cargoes were sent to  Germany  and West
Africa. Supplies of the fuel, which includes diesel and heating
oil, arrived from  Norway ,  Russia  and the U.K., it said.  Gasoline (ARASGSLN)  stockpiles rose 1.4 percent to 716,000 tons as
shipments arrived from  France , Russia, Sweden and the U.K., PJK
said. That’s the highest level since mid-July. Cargoes were sent
to China, Nigeria, the  United Arab Emirates  and the U.S.  Naphtha (ARASNPHT)  inventories dropped by more than half to 47,000
tons even as supplies arrived from Russia, PJK said. That’s the
lowest level since Oct. 27.  Fuel oil  lost 2.3 percent to 560,000 tons as a very large
vessel carried fuel to  Singapore , it said. That’s the lowest
since March 3. Cargoes arrived from France, Lithuania, Poland
and Russia.  Jet fuel  fell 11 percent to 490,000 tons even as supplies
arrived from  India  and the U.A.E. That’s the least since Dec. 1.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and jet fuel
