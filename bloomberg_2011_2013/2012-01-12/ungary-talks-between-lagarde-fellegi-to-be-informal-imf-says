Discussions between  International
Monetary Fund  Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  and Hungary’s
envoy Tamas Fellegi in  Washington  today are informal, an IMF
spokesman said.  “These are not negotiating discussions, this is not a
negotiation for the program, it’s an informal discussion,”
Gerry Rice, the director of the IMF’s external relations
department, told reporters.  He also said an IMF monitoring mission to Italy would take
place later this month “or very soon thereafter.”  An IMF team will start a visit in Egypt next week, Rice
said to initiate “discussions on possible IMF support.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
