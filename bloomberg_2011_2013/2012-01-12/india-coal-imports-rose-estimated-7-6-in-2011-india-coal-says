India â€™s coal imports rose an
estimated 7.6 percent last year to 118.4 million metric tons,
 India Coal Market Watch  said in a note.  Overseas purchases of thermal coal rose 11.1 percent to
84.1 million tons in 2011 from 75.7 million in 2010, the coal
newsletter said, citing calculations based on vessel positions
at 25 major and minor ports in India. Coking coal of the steel-
making variety accounted for the rest.  Indonesia  may have accounted for 64 million tons of steam
coal, it said. Total purchases were lower-than-forecast because
of slowing economic activity in steel, cement and sponge iron
and high stocks in September and October, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
