Estonia ’s opposition  Social
Democratic Party  has agreed to merge with the Russian Party in
Estonia, which vows to protect the rights of the country’s
Russian-speaking minority.  A merger agreement, which will keep the name of the Social
Democratic Party unchanged, will be signed today by the chairmen
of both parties, the Social Democrats said in a statement on
their  website  yesterday. The agreement has to be formally
approved at general meetings of both parties, it said.  Estonia’s Russian minority makes up almost 30 percent of
the 1.3 million inhabitants of the Baltic nation. The Russian
Party won 0.9 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary
elections in March 2011, below the electoral threshold of 5
percent.  The Social Democrats won 19 mandates in the 101-seat
parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
