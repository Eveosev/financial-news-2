Swiss stocks  rose, rebounding from
yesterday’s slide, as  Spain  and Italy sold debt at auctions and
 Sulzer AG (SUN)  reported higher orders.  Sulzer AG advanced after reporting an increase in 2011
orders. Swiss refiner Petroplus Holdings AG surged the most
since its initial public offering in 2006.  Meyer Burger
Technology AG (MBTN)  climbed 9.2 percent as solar stocks gained.  The  SMI (SMI) , a measure of the biggest and most actively traded
companies, added 0.2 percent to 6,018.07 at the close of trading
in Zurich, paring yesterday’s 0.7 percent loss. The broader
Swiss Performance Index increased 0.3 percent today.  Spain sold 9.98 billion euros ($12.8 billion) of  government
bonds  maturing in 2015 and 2016 at an auction today, the
nation’s Treasury said. That was almost twice its target of 5
billion euros.  Italy  sold 12 billion euros of Treasury bills, meeting its
target, in the country’s first debt sale of the year. The Rome-
based Treasury sold 8.5 billion euros of one-year bills at a
rate of 2.735 percent, down from 5.952 percent at the last
auction of similar-maturity securities on Dec. 12. Investors bid
for 1.47 times the amount offered, down from 1.92 times last
month. Italy also sold 3.5 billion euros of 136-day bills to
yield 1.644 percent.  In the U.S., a Labor Department report showed that  jobless
claims  climbed by 24,000 to 399,000 in the week ended Jan. 7.
The  median forecast  of 46 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
had projected 375,000 claims.  A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that
 retail sales  climbed 0.1 percent in December following a 0.4
percent advance in November. Economists had forecast a 0.3
percent increase last month, according to the  median estimate  in
a Bloomberg News survey.  Interest Rates  In the U.K., Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  refrained
from adding to emergency stimulus because the economy has shown
some resilience heading into 2012. The central bank also kept
its  benchmark interest rate  at a record low of 0.5 percent.  ECB policy makers meeting in Frankfurt held the euro area’s
benchmark interest rate at its record low of 1 percent, as
predicted by 47 of 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Sulzer surged 5.1 percent to 112.50 Swiss francs. The Swiss
maker of pumps said full-year orders for 2011 rose 13.7 percent,
or 8.4 percent nominally, from a year earlier.  Petroplus soared 16 percent to 1.39 francs, gaining for a
third day. The oil refiner reached a temporary agreement with
its lenders to renegotiate debt and maintain operations at its
Coryton and Ingolstadt refineries.  Meyer Burger Jumps  Meyer Burger, Europe’s biggest manufacturer of the factory
equipment for making solar gear, rallied 9.2 percent to 17.25
francs, its biggest gain in five months. Increased installations
in Germany and the U.K. and China’s plans to double total
capacity this year have driven demand for solar panels, said
Aaron Chew, a Maxim Group LLC analyst in  New York .  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  jumped 5.3 percent to 88.85 francs,
gaining for a third day. The insurer plans cost cuts that go
beyond its 2012 targets under the Milestone program.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Switzerland’s largest
banks , gained 2.4 percent to 11.39 francs and 0.9 percent to
21.68 francs respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
