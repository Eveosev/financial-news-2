Canada ’s dollar declined against
most of its major counterparts amid concern economic growth may
be less than forecast in the U.S., the nation’s largest trading
partner.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, weakened after
sales at U.S. retailers in December rose 0.1 percent, restrained
by cheaper fuel prices and holiday discounting that helped hold
down the value of goods sold. Canada’s dollar erased earlier
gains against its U.S. counterpart on comments by the European
Central Bank President that the region’s debt crisis is easing.  “The Canadian dollar is weaker in tandem with the U.S.,”
 Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at National
Bank of Canada, said by phone from Toronto.  The currency was little changed at C$1.0191 per  U.S. dollar 
at 5 p.m. Toronto time, after gaining has much as 0.6 percent.
One Canadian dollar buys 98.13 U.S. cents.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2 percent,
erasing a decline of as much as 0.5 percent. The MSCI World
Index of equities in developed nations rose 0.3 percent. Crude
oil for February delivery dropped 1.8 percent to $99.19 a
barrel.  Bonds Fall  Canadian 10-year  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield
up four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.98 percent.
The 3.25 percent securities maturing in June 2021 fell 38 cents
to C$110.84.  The yield touched 1.837 percent on Dec. 16, the lowest
level in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1989. The
premium to equivalent-maturity U.S. Treasuries is five basis
points, compared with 32 basis points on Sept. 5, the most in
2011, and 17 basis points less than at the end of 2010.  There are “tentative signs” of economic stabilization in
the euro area, ECB President  Mario Draghi  said in  Frankfurt ,
pointing to auctions of Italian and Spanish debt this week.  “Successful Italian and Spanish bond auctions have markets
giddy that ECB lending is finally working its way through to the
vulnerable European bond markets,” Scotia Capital analysts led
by  Camilla Sutton  in Toronto wrote in a note to clients. “This
is positive for risk assets and has helped support a rally
today.”  Spain ’s debt auction drew demand for 9.98 billion euros
($12.8 billion) of bonds maturing in 2015 and 2016, twice its
maximum target. Italy sold 12 billion euros of Treasury bills
today, meeting its target.  The loonie gained 1.2 percent during the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a
gauge of 10 developed-nation currencies. The U.S. dollar lost
0.6 percent, and the euro fell 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
