FMS Wertmanagement plans to sell at
least 500 million euros of two-year floating-rate notes,
according to a banker involved in the transaction.  The notes may be priced to yield about 6 basis points more
than Euribor, the banker said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Natixis, UBS AG and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are managing the deal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
