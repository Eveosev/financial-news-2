The Australian and New Zealand
dollars traded little changed after a report showed Chinese
consumer prices rose by 4.1 percent in December from the year
earlier.  The Australian currency traded at $1.0291 at 12:33 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0296 before the report and $1.0310 yesterday in
 New York . The  New Zealand dollar , nicknamed the kiwi, bought
79.59 U.S. cents from 79.63 before the data and 79.70 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
