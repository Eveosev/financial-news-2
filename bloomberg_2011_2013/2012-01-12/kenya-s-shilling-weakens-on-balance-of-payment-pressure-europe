Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
third day out of four, headed for its lowest close in more than
a week, on concern that balance of payment pressure and the
European debt crisis would weigh on the exchange rate.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy declined 0.6
percent to 87.70 per dollar by 11:13 a.m. in Nairobi. A close at
that level would be the weakest since Jan. 4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Concerns over the balance of payment situation and the
ongoing Euro debt crisis is weighing on the shilling hence the
weakening; a situation likely to persist in the foreseeable
future,” Jeremiah Kendagor head of trading at Nairobi based
Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  The central bank monetary policy committee yesterday noted
that balance of payments pressures and continued turbulence in
the global financial markets due to the European debt crisis
present potential risks to the  exchange rate .  Uganda ’s shilling retreated 0.2 percent against the dollar,
after closing unchanged for four consecutive sessions, to 2,460.
Tanzania’s shilling fell 0.5 percent to 1,588.50 per dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
