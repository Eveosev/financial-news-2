Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest energy
explorer, will build the $34 billion Ichthys liquefied natural
gas venture, the nation’s single-biggest investment in Australia,
to meet rising demand from utilities.  Inpex and partner  Total SA (FP)  of France made an  investment
decision  to proceed with the venture, which will create about
4,000 jobs, the Tokyo-based company said today in a statement.  Ichthys is among A$200 billion ($207 billion) of LNG
developments planned or under construction in Australia as the
country moves toward the No. 1 spot in the global rankings of
LNG suppliers. Australia, with projects led by Chevron Corp.,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Woodside Petroleum Ltd. and
ConocoPhillips, will “rival” Qatar as the world’s biggest
exporter by 2016, Energy Minister Martin Ferguson has said.  “We will be securing vital long-term  energy supply  to
Japan and our other customers while delivering sustainable
economic and social benefits,” Inpex said today.  Japanese utilities need supplies for power generation after
the earthquake and tsunami in March last year crippled the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station and prompted most of the
country’s atomic plants to shut for safety checks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
