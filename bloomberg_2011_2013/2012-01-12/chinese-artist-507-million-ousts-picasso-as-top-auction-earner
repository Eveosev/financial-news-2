Pablo Picasso  has been dethroned.  The world auction market’s top earner in recent years must
yield to Chinese artist  Zhang Daqian  (1899-1983), according to a
report from French research company Artprice.  Zhang generated $506.7 million in auction revenue in 2011.
Close behind was compatriot Qi Baishi (1864-1957) with $445.1
million. They lead a group of more than 450,000 artists tracked
by Artprice. Picasso ranked fourth at $311.6 million.  “When you couple China’s abundance of money and its rich
history of collecting in all the categories of art, it’s not a
surprise,” said Larry Warsh, a New York-based collector.  The change reflects China’s growing strength in the global
art market. Of the approximately $11 billion total world revenue
for fine art last year,  China ’s share was 39 percent, up from 33
percent the year before, Artprice said. The U.S. was No. 2 with
25 percent.  Andy Warhol  came in third among artists in the Artprice
report, with $324.8 million. The fifth slot was occupied by yet
another Chinese name, Xu Beihong (1895-1953), who tallied $212.9
million.  These Chinese “artists are maybe not well-known on the art
scene but they are the leading modern masters in China,” said
Martin Bremond, head economist at Artprice. “They are on top
because China is the No. 1 country at auction and the Chinese
are buying their own artists.”  Beating Still  Zhang is famous for his mastery of landscape painting and
variety of styles, according to Melissa Chiu, director of the
Asia Society Museum in  New York . His 1947 “Lotus and Mandarin
ducks” fetched HK$191 million ($24.5 million) at Sotheby’s in
 Hong Kong  in May 2011, a record for the artist whose annual
auction revenue increased by about 13 times in the past two
years.  Qi is best known for his ink depictions of animals, birds
and insects on paper and silk, Chiu said. His somber ink
painting “Eagle Standing on Pine Tree; Four-Character Couplet
in Seal Script” fetched 425.5 million yuan ($65.5 million) at
 China Guardian Auctions Co . in Beijing in May 2011.  That’s more than last year’s top auction result in the
West: Clyfford Still’s abstract painting “1949-A-No.1,” which
sold for $61.7 million at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in November.  Picasso held his No. 1 position on Artprice for all but one
year since 1997. In 2007, Warhol pushed him into second place.  In 2010, Picasso scored his highest auction tally of $362.7
million, boosted by the record sale of the painting “Nude,
 Green Leaves  and Bust,” which fetched $106.5 million at
Christie’s in New York.  Auction rooms in Hong Kong and mainland China teem with
buyers competing aggressively for their heritage. Of the 100
best individual auction results in 2011, 30 were set in Hong
Kong, Beijing and Hangzhou, according to Artprice.  ‘Its Own Heroes’  “Western heroes are not Chinese heroes,” said Warsh.
“China is very nationalistic and demands its own heroes and
culture.”  Recognizing the country’s growing role, Christie’s doubled
its presence in what it calls “greater China” (Hong Kong, the
mainland and  Taiwan ) in 2011, said Steven Murphy, the company’s
chief executive officer.  “The true fact of globalization is here,” Murphy said in
a telephone interview. “Both the information about art and
ability to see and acquire art in many parts of the world mean
that it’s available everywhere, all the time.”  To contact the reporter of this story:
