EON AG (EOAN)  and  RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s biggest
utilities, fell in Frankfurt trading after a court said the
country’s nuclear fuel tax didn’t break the law.  EON dropped 1.3 percent to 16.45 euros after a tax court
in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg upheld the levy in two
interim rulings against plaintiff EnBW Energie Baden-
Wuerttemberg AG, the country’s third-largest utility. RWE
slipped 0.7 percent while EnBW slid 2.6 percent.  “There are no serious doubts as to the constitutionality
of the nuclear fuel tax,” the finance court of Baden-
Wuerttemberg, EnBW’s home state, said today in an e-mailed
statement. The rulings, which can be appealed, applies to EnBW
only.  Germany’s utilities are cutting costs and selling assets to
curb losses related to the government’s decision to exit nuclear
power by 2022. The shutdown of the country’s eight oldest
reactors, as well as the nuclear fuel tax, drafted in 2010, cut
EON’s earnings by 2.3 billion euros ($3 billion) in 2011, Chief
Financial Officer Marcus Schenck said in November.  The judges didn’t share the legal analysis by courts in
Munich and Hamburg, which had ruled in favor of EON and RWE over
the tax. The divergence in rulings will be resolved once
Germany’s top tax court mades its judgement. Appeals of the
Munich and the Hamburg cases are pending, the judges said in
today’s statement.  EnBW is “reading and analyzing” today’s rulings,  Ulrich Schroeder , a company spokesman, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
