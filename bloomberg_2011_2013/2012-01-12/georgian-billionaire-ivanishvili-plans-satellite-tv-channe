Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili plans to open a satellite television channel managed
by his wife Ekaterine Khvedelidze, as he prepares to contest a
parliamentary election next year.  No date has been set for putting the channel on air, Nona
Kandiashvili, a spokeswoman for Ivanishvili, said by telephone
in the capital Tbilisi today. The channel received a
broadcasting license in September, said Khatia Kurashvili, a
spokeswoman for the National Communications Commission.  Ivanishvili, whose wealth was estimated at $5.5 billion by
Forbes magazine in March, began a public movement last month
aimed at challenging President Mikheil Saakashvili’s party in
the election.  Ivanishvili’s lawyers said yesterday that they had
petitioned the country’s Justice Ministry to restore his
Georgian citizenship, which was revoked on Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
