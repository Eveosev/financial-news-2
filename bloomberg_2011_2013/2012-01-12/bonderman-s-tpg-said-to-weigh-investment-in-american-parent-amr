David Bonderman’s TPG Capital is
studying whether to invest in American Airlines parent  AMR Corp (AAMRQ) .
in bankruptcy, and  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  has hired advisers to
assess a possible bid, people familiar with the matter said.  TPG’s review remains in the early stages, and no decisions
have been reached about whether to take an AMR stake or buy the
company outright, said one of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the talks are private.  US Airways  also hasn’t
made any decisions, said another person.  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  also is studying a possible bid, the
Wall Street Journal reported, citing people it didn’t identify.
Spokesmen for Fort Worth, Texas-based American, US Airways and
Delta all declined to comment.  AMR, whose American is the third-largest U.S. airline,
filed for  bankruptcy protection  on Nov. 29, weighed down by
annual losses that began in 2008 and were projected by analysts
to persist at least through this year.  Delta is the world’s second-largest carrier by traffic,
after vaulting past American by buying Northwest Airlines Corp.
in 2008, while Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways is No. 5 in the
U.S.  Delta, based in Atlanta, gained 3 percent to $8.87 at 4:15
p.m. in New York trading. US Airways rose 2.4 percent to $6.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
