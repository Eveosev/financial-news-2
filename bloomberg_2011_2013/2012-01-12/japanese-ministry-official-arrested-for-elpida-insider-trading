A Japanese trade ministry official
was arrested for suspected  insider trading  on companies
including  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , the government said.  Masaaki Kimura, 53, allegedly took advantage of his
position in 2009 and traded on Elpida and NEC Electronics Corp.,
the Tokyo-based ministry said in a statement today. NEC
Electronics merged with Renesas Technology Corp. to form Renesas
Electronics Corp. in 2010.  Kimura was deputy director-general of the ministry’s
commerce and information policy bureau when chipmaker Elpida
received 30 billion yen from the state-run Development Bank of
Japan Inc. The company also received 100 billion yen from
lenders to help pay for restructuring.  “It’s unacceptable” if the allegation is true, Trade
Minister  Yukio Edano  said in a separate statement. He told
ministry employees to refrain from trading securities “for a
while.”  The ministry also will ask employees to register brokerage
accounts used by them or their spouses with the ministry,
according to the statement.  Elpida and  Renesas (6723)  declined to comment.  Elpida shares declined 1.6 percent to 308 yen in Tokyo
trading, and Elpida fell 0.7 percent to 445 yen. The benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
