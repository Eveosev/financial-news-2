OAO AvtoVAZ (AVAZ)  had its biggest two-day
gain in more than a month as sales climbed and investors bet
Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co. will complete talks to acquire a
majority holding in  Russia ’s largest carmaker.  The shares added as much as 10 percent and traded 6.6
percent higher at 23.5 rubles by 11:18 a.m. in Moscow, extending
yesterday’s 9.2 percent advance for the best two-day gain on an
intraday basis since Dec. 2.  AvtoVaz boosted sales in Russia 11 percent to 578,387
vehicles last year, the Togliatti-based company said yesterday.
 Carlos Ghosn , chief executive officer of Nissan and Renault,
said Jan. 9 that a deal may be completed within weeks. Renault
bought 25 percent of Russia’s largest carmaker in 2008 for $1
billion.  “We would expect positive sentiment towards the stock once
Renault finalizes a deal to increase its stake in  AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) ,”
