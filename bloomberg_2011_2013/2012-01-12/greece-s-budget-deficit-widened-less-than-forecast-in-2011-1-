Greece ’s state budget deficit
widened by 0.8 percent in 2011, less than the government
anticipated in its revised forecast for the period.  The budget gap, which excludes spending by state-owned
institutions and companies, grew to 21.64 billion euros ($27.53
billion) compared with 21.46 billion euros a year earlier,
according to preliminary figures released today by e-mail from
the Athens-based  Finance Ministry . The figure beat a target of
21.71 billion euros set in the 2012 budget, the ministry said.  Ordinary budget revenue last year declined 1.7 percent to
50 billion euros as Greece’s financial crisis saw a drop in
taxable personal income and after a two-day strike of tax
offices at the end of December delayed payment of all
outstanding revenue, according to the ministry.  Spending rose 2.8 percent, or by 1.9 billion euros, mainly
due to a “significant increase” in debt-servicing costs, the
ministry said. The increase in spending was also less than
targeted.  After two years of wage cuts and tax increases, the
 International Monetary Fund  estimates Greece’s 2011 deficit to
have been about 9 percent of gross domestic product, down from
10.6 percent in 2010. The economy was expected to shrink about 6
percent last year, according to the latest IMF forecast,
compared with an outlook of 3.8 percent in June.  The deficit figure may have been around 9.6 percent,
Greece’s Development, Competitiveness and Shipping Minister
Michalis Chrisochoides said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
