German plant and machinery orders
posted their first annual decline in almost two years in
November, led by a drop in demand from outside  Europe , the VDMA
machine-makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, fell 12 percent from a year
ago after increasing an annual 1 percent in October, Frankfurt-
based VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today. It was the first
decline since January 2010. Orders from abroad dropped 17
percent while domestic sales fell 2 percent. In the three months
through November, overall orders fell 4 percent from the same
period a year earlier.  “As orders were unusually strong in November 2010 we can’t
talk of a slump here,” VDMA chief economist Ralph Weichers said
in the statement. “In addition, the drop wasn’t due to
reductions in the euro area, rather to fewer orders from outside
Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
