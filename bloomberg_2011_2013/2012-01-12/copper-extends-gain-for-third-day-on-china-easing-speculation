Copper advanced for a third day on
speculation cooling inflation in  China , the world’s largest
consumer, may provide room for the government to ease monetary
policy to spur growth and demand.  The metal for delivery in three months climbed as much as
0.8 percent to $7,845 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and traded at $7,825 at 3:10 p.m. Shanghai time. The March-
delivery contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed 1
percent higher at 57,400 yuan ($9,087) a ton.  Consumer prices in China rose 4.1 percent in December from
a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said. That was
the smallest gain in 15 months, and compares with the median
estimate of 4 percent in a Bloomberg News survey and 4.2 percent
in November. Producer prices gained 1.7 percent last month,
matching economists’ forecasts.  “A lot of focus is on the fine-tuning of China’s monetary
policy, and how it will affect demand and commodity investment
inflows,” said Wang Na, an analyst at Guolian Futures Co. “For
now, the actual demand seems to be weak.”  Inflation is set to moderate further in coming months and
be less of a concern, paving the way for more policy easing as
economic growth slows, Chang Jian, a Hong Kong-based economist
at Barclays Capital Asia Ltd., said before today’s release.
Chang expects four reductions in banks’ reserve requirement
ratio this year to encourage lending and estimates inflation may
slow to less than 3.5 percent by the second quarter.  Cash Discount  On  Shanghai ’s Changjiang spot market, copper for immediate
delivery was traded at a discount of around 125 yuan to the
front-month futures contract in Shanghai. Chinese imports of
unwrought copper and products gained 13 percent from November to
a record 508,942 tons last month, customs data showed.  China’s auto sales slowed last year, rising 2.5 percent to
18.5 million, according to data released by the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers today, which trailed
growth in the U.S. for the first time in at least 14 years.  On the LME, aluminum gained 0.2 percent to $2,169.75 a ton,
lead climbed 0.5 percent to $2,000 a ton and nickel rose 0.2
percent to $19,490 a ton. Zinc was little changed at $1,937 a
ton and tin dropped 0.1 percent to $20,501 per ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
