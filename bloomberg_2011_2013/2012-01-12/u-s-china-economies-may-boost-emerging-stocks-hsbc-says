Emerging-market stocks are cheap by
historical measures and may perform strongly this year thanks to
receding risks of economic slowdowns in the U.S. and  China ,
according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  Recent U.S. data have been better than consensus estimates
and cooling Chinese inflation may allow authorities there leeway
to stimulate the economy should it slow, HSBC strategists  John Lomax , Wietse Nijenhuis and Herald van der Linde wrote in an e-
mailed report.  Unless the European Union’s debt problems deteriorate they
shouldn’t prevent emerging-market equities from rising, the
analysts said. They boosted their recommendation for both
Chinese and Brazilian equities to “overweight” from
“neutral.”  While HSBC is forecasting world gross domestic product
growth of 1.9 percent this year, emerging-market “equity
valuations appear to be discounting something significantly
worse,” the analysts said. “If fear of tail risks lessens, EM
equity markets could perform surprisingly well.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
