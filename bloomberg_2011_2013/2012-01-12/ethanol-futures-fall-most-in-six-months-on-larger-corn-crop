Ethanol futures fell the most in
more than six months after a government report showing that
supplies of corn were higher than forecast sent futures for the
grain down the exchange-imposed limit.  Ethanol tumbled 5 percent after the Agriculture Department
said corn  inventories  on Dec. 1 were 9.642 billion bushels,
compared with 9.439 billion forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of analysts. Ethanol is expected to use 5 billion bushels of
corn this year and the lower corn price might ease expenses.  “The big story is the surprising USDA report, which was
really pressuring ethanol,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest
in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery tumbled 11.3 cents
to $2.154 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the steepest
decline since June 30 and the lowest price since Dec. 20.
Futures have slipped 8.3 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  slid 8 cents,
or 3.4 percent, to $2.245 a gallon and on the West Coast the
additive declined 5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.275, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  Chicago  fell 4.5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.15
a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive slipped 2.5 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.25.  Corn for March delivery plummeted 40 cents, or 6.1 percent,
to $6.115 a bushel in Chicago. One such unit makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
