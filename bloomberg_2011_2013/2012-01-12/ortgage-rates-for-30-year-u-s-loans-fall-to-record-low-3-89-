Rates for 30-year U.S. mortgages
fell to the lowest level on record after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  urged lawmakers to do more to revive
housing.  The average rate for a  30-year  fixed loan decreased to 3.89
percent in the week ended today, the lowest in records dating to
1971, from 3.91 percent,  Freddie Mac  said in a statement. The
average  15-year  rate dropped to 3.16 percent from 3.23 percent,
according to the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance
company.  Bernanke, in a 26-page report to Congress last week, called
the weakness in the  property market  a “significant barrier” to
U.S. economic health and outlined possible ways to clear the
glut of foreclosed properties, protect homeowners from default
and help borrowers take advantage of low borrowing costs. While
 home prices  continue to  decline , demand is picking up amid
improving  consumer confidence  and employment data.  “There’s a general economic improvement that is serving to
promote home sales, and the low and stable mortgage rate
environment plays into that very well,” said  Keith Gumbinger ,
vice president of HSH Associates, a loan-data firm in Pompton
Plains,  New Jersey .  The U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent
in December, the lowest since February 2009, the Labor
Department said last week. Confidence among consumers rose to an
eight-month high, the Conference Board said Dec. 27.  Home Sales  New-home  sales  jumped to a seven-month high in November,
according to Commerce Department figures released Dec. 23. Sales
of  existing homes  rose in November to a 10-month high, the
National Association of Realtors said Dec. 21.  Home-loan applications climbed 4.5 percent in the period
ended Jan. 6, according to a Mortgage Bankers Association index.
The Washington-based group’s measure of  purchases  rose 8.1
percent from a three-month low, while its  refinancing  index
increased 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
