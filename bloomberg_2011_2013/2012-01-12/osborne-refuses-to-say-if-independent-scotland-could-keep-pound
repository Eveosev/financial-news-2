U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  refused to say whether an independent Scotland
would be allowed to keep the pound.  In his first public intervention on the independence debate
Osborne, who heads the Cabinet’s Scotland committee, said only
that Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond was committed to
joining the euro. Salmond said yesterday he wouldn’t do this
without a referendum.  “I think the people of Scotland would lose out in terms of
the Scottish economy,” Osborne told ITV News today. “I don’t
think Scotland would be as prosperous as it would be as part of
the U.K. I think there are businesses that are nervous about
investing in Scotland when they don’t know about its
constitutional future.”  As well as the currency question, Osborne cited the size of
the national debt an independent  Scotland  would have to take on
and whether the country would be rich enough to bail out its
banks in a future crisis as examples of questions that those
arguing for independence needed to answer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
