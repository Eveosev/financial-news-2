Volvo AB (VOLVB)  is making no change in its
outlook for the European truck market this year, Chief Financial
Officer Anders Osberg said today at a press conference in  Abu
Dhabi .  The company’s sales in the Middle East are likely to rise
30 percent by 2015 in all the manufacturer’s product ranges,
Osberg said.  Volvo said on Oct. 25 that the European heavy-truck market
will shrink by 10 percent in 2012 from the 240,000 vehicles
forecast for 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
