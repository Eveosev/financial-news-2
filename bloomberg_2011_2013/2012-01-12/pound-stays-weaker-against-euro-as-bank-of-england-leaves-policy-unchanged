The pound stayed lower against the
 euro  after the  Bank of England  kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 0.5 percent and maintained its bond-purchase target
at 275 billion pounds ($422 billion).  Sterling weakened 0.2 percent to 83.09 pence per euro at
12:04 p.m. London time. It strengthened less than 0.2 percent to
$1.5353.  U.K. government bonds were little changed, with the 10-year
yield at 2.02 percent from 2.01 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
