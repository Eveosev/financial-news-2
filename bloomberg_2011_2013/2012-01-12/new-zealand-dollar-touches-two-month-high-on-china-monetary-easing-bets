Australia ’s dollar retreated from a
one-week high versus the dollar after U.S. retail sales
increased less than forecast and jobless-benefits claims fell,
damping risk appetite.  The Aussie surged earlier after a report showed  China ’s
inflation cooled, increasing speculation the Asian nation may
move to spur growth. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi,
erased an earlier advance.  “You had a good increase in Aussie-dollar during  Asia , but
after the U.S. data was released it gave up all its gains,”
said Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in New York. “The sentiment has been flattened.”  Australia’s dollar traded 0.2 percent higher at $1.0330 at
2:01 p.m. New York time, after rallying earlier as much as 0.7
percent to $1.0378, the highest level since Jan. 4. The Aussie
fetched 79.28 yen.  New Zealand ’s currency fell 0.4 percent to 79.37 U.S.
cents. It gained 0.1 percent earlier to 79.81 cents, the
strongest since Nov. 9. The kiwi sank 0.5 percent to 60.92 yen.  Commerce Department data showed sales at U.S. retailers
 climbed  0.1 percent in December, versus a 0.3 percent gain
forecast in a Bloomberg survey. U.S. unemployment claims climbed
by 24,000 to 399,000 in the week ended Jan. 7, Labor Department
data showed. A Bloomberg survey forecast 375,000 claims. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed after rising 0.3
percent earlier.  China’s consumer prices  increased  4.1 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing
today, compared with 4.2 percent in November.  The nation is Australia’s biggest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-largest export market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
