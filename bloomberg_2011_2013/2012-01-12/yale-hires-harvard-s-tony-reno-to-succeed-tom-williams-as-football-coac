Yale University  hired Tony Reno as
football coach, going to the staff of rival  Harvard University 
to fill the vacancy created when  Tom Williams  resigned after
acknowledging problems with his resume.  Reno, 37, spent the past three seasons at Harvard, where he
coached defensive backs and worked as special teams coordinator.
He spent the previous six seasons as an assistant coach at Yale,
in New Haven, Connecticut, mostly working with defensive backs.  “I take great pride and honor in becoming the leader of
the men of Yale,” Reno said today in a news release from the
school announcing his hiring. “Protecting and building upon the
tradition and success of the Yale football program is paramount
to me.”  The 1997 graduate of Worcester State College in
 Massachusetts  also worked as defensive coordinator and wide
receivers coach at his alma mater, where he won the 2002
National Assistant Coach of the Year award.  Williams, 42, stepped down last month amid an inquiry into
whether he lied about being a Rhodes Scholarship candidate in
1992 while attending Stanford University. Yale began
investigating the claim, which was in Williams’s biography on
the athletic department website and restated in a Nov. 8
interview with Bloomberg News, after officials of the Rhodes
Trust found no evidence that Williams applied for the
scholarship.  The Bulldogs finished the 2011 season 5-5, including a 4-3
mark in the Ivy League, and lost to Harvard 45-7 in the annual
showdown known as “The Game.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
