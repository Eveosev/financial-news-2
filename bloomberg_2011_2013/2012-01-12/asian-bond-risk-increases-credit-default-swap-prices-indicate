The cost of protecting Asian
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment rose, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2 basis points to 207.5 as of 8:11
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices show. The measure
ranged between 102 and 277 basis points in 2011, according to
data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was unchanged at 178.5
basis points as of 11:13 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The index has fallen two basis points this year,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index was little changed from
yesterdayâ€™s closing price at 192 basis points as of 9.11 a.m. in
 Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
