The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
 Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 commodities fell 1.2 percent to close at 655.23 at

percent to 1,552.1.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures in New York fell to the lowest price in
more than two years after a government report showed a below-

percent, to settle at $2.697 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures earlier
declined to $2.663, the lowest intraday price since Sept. 8,
2009.  In London, gas for next month gained as much as 0.45 pence
to 55.45 pence a therm. It was at 55.2 pence at 4:45 p.m. in

curb supplies.  Orange juice for March delivery dropped by the 10-cent
exchange limit, or 5.3 percent, to settle at $1.781 a pound at 2

Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the
session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 37 cents a barrel
less than Dated Brent, compared with a discount of 43 cents

prices for food and biofuels.  Corn futures for March delivery tumbled the 40-cent limit,
