China will probably increase its
 crude-processing  volume by 5 percent to 470 million metric tons
this year and lift crude output by 1.5 percent to more than 200
million tons, the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry
Federation said today.  The nation’s apparent crude consumption is expected to rise
5.3 percent to 480 million tons and apparent oil-product
consumption may advance 5.8 percent to 280 million tons, the
group said in a statement on its website.  Natural-gas production will probably increase 11 percent to
113 billion cubic meters while apparent consumption will gain
15.3 percent to 148.2 billion cubic meters, it said.  The federation didn’t say how it calculates apparent
consumption, which is typically defined as the sum of domestic
output and net imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
