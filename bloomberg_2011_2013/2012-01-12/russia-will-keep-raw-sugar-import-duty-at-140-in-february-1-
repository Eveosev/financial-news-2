Russia  will keep the raw sugar
import duty at $140 a metric ton in February, the Customs Union
Commission data show.  The duty is based on monthly sugar prices in  New York , with
a one-month lag. A minimum rate of $140 a ton is applied from
August through April if the monthly average price in New York
exceeds $396.84 a ton, according to the commission.  The average raw sugar price in New York was calculated at
23.42 cents a pound, or $516.22 a ton in December, the
commission, which oversees the tariffs for Russia, Belarus and
Kazakhstan, said on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
