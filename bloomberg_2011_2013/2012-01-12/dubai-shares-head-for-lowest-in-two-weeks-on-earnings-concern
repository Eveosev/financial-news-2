Dubai shares declined, sending the
benchmark index to its lowest close in more than two weeks, on
investor concern that fourth-quarter profits may be below
analysts’ estimates.  Dubai Financial Market PJSC (DFM) , the only publicly traded Gulf
Arab stock market, slumped to the lowest level since Feb. 2009.
Emirates NBD PJSC, the nation’s biggest bank by assets, declined
the most in more than two weeks. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
fell 0.5 percent to 1,327.54 at the 2:00 p.m. close in the
emirate. About 79 million shares traded in Dubai, compared with
a 12-month daily average of 99 million shares, according to  data
compiled by Bloomberg .  “Confidence is really weak,” said Tariq Qaqish, deputy
head of asset management at Al Mal Capital in Dubai. There is
some concern among investors that company earnings may come in
below expectations, he said. “Investors are frustrated and have
no faith to enter the market when there is no floor.”  Dubai Financial Market may report a profit of 53.2 million
dirhams ($14.5 million) for 2011, down from 79 million dirhams a
year earlier, according to the mean estimate of six analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. Emirates NBD may need to set aside as
much as 8 billion dirhams by the end of 2013 to cover bad loans,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a Dec. 7 report.  Dubai Financial Market declined 1.4 percent to 76.1 fils.
Emirates NBD retreated 3.2 percent to 2.71 dirhams. There are
100 fils to the dirham.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  fell less than 0.1 percent.  Abu
Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  declined 0.2 percent and Oman’s  MSM30
Index (MSM30)  fell 0.3 percent. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  lost 0.1 percent, while
measures in  Kuwait (KWSEIDX)  and  Bahrain (BHSEASI)  rose 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent,
respectively.  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  was closed
for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
