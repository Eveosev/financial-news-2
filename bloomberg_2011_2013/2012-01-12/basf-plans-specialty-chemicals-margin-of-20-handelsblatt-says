BASF SE (BAS)  is targeting an operating
profit margin of 20 percent in the medium term at its
performance products unit, which makes food additives and drug
ingredients,  Handelsblatt  said, citing an interview with board
member Michael Heinz.  BASF will achieve its planned 450 million-euro ($572
million) synergies from the integration with Ciba in 2012, the
German newspaper cited Heinz as saying. The combination with
Cognis will save the company 290 million euros instead of a
previously estimated 275 million euros, Handelsblatt reported.
  The unitâ€™s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization made up about 17 percent of sales in 2010, Heinz,
who is responsible for the unit, told the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
