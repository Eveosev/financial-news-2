Serbia  will seek an adviser to help
it find a partner for tapping its so far unused oil shale
reserves as the country seeks to reduce oil imports.  The adviser will help prepare the tender for
“exploitation, preparation, processing and production of oil
and oil derivatives from shale in the Aleksinac basin” in
southeastern Serbia, home to estimated 2 billion tons of shale
reserves, the Mining Ministry said in an e-mailed statement. The
fee will be about 20 million dinars ($244,000).  Serbia hopes to eventually produce between 500,000 tons and
600,000 tons of oil from shale, replacing part of the imports
that range from 1.8 million tons to 2.7 million tons a year, the
ministry said.  Peu-Resavica, a state-run mining company, is taking samples
from more than 100 exploratory drills near Aleksinac and a
sample analysis will be completed by the end of the month, the
government said. It said that “oil shale will be initially
mined from open pits” and later in underground shafts.  The adviser is expected to come up with an “optimal model
for the realization of such a complex project,” including the
size of necessary investment that, according to earlier
estimates, may exceed $1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
