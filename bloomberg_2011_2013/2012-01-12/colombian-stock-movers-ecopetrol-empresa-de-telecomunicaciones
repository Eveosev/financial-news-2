from the sale of a stake in Ecopetrol by tapping sovereign
wealth funds and international investors, Mines and Energy
Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said today.  The government will sell as much as 3 percentage points of
its stake in Ecopetrol, pending congressional approval that is
probable in the first half of the year, Cardenas said in an
interview in Bogota today. The government now owns about 88.5
percent of the company.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota SA  (ETB CB), the
city-run phone company serving  Colombia ’s capital, rose 10
percent to 534 pesos.  Mario Contreras, who took over as the company’s president
in September, presented his resignation effective Jan. 16,
according to a regulatory filing today. The filing gave no
further details.  The Bogota mayor’s office plans to merge ETB, as the
company is known, with other public companies and will not sell
its majority stake in the company, Eduardo Noriega, the city’s
secretary general, said yesterday in a statement prepared by
Mayor Gustavo Petro, according to a statement on Petro’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
