Chancellor  Angela Merkel  may have
the backing of her  Christian Democratic Union  on the
introduction of a financial transaction tax that’s confined to
the euro region, the draft of a party resolution suggests.  “If the introduction within the framework of a joint
approach by the European Union and the U.S. or within the entire
EU isn’t possible, we will support an implementation in the euro
states,” says a draft party resolution to be agreed at a Jan.
13-14 meeting of the CDU in the northern city of Kiel.  The tax has to be implemented in a way that protects
 Germany ’s interests as a business location for financial
services, according to the draft, obtained by Bloomberg News.
The U.S. and the U.K. have rejected the tax, saying it would
hurt their financial industries.  Merkel said yesterday that her support for the levy is her
“personal opinion” and any policy would have to be formulated
as part of a consensus with her Free Democrat coalition partner.
Some lawmakers in her own party such as deputy floor leader
 Michael Fuchs  reject a euro region-only tax.  The European Commission has suggested a tax of 0.1 percent
on equity and bond trades, and 0.01 percent on derivatives,
which it said could raise 55 billion euros ($70 billion) a year.
EU finance ministers will discuss the levy in March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
