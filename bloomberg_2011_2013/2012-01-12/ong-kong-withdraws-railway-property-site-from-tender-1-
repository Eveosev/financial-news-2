The  Hong Kong  government today
withdrew the tender for a property project atop a  railway
station , and sold another site below surveyors’ estimates of its
value.  None of the bids for Bayside, the project above the Tsuen
Wan West train station, was accepted, Tsuen Wan West Property
Development Ltd. said in a statement today. Tsuen Wan West is
the company set up by the government to manage the project. The
site was expected to fetch HK$7.4 billion ($953 million),
according to the median estimate of five surveyors in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Chinachem Group (CCLZ) , the closely-held developer controlled by
the estate of the late  Nina Wang , paid HK$2.6 billion for the
711,000 square feet Cityside project adjacent to Bayside, the
company said in a statement. That site was expected to be sold
for HK$2.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg News survey.  The government is one of the city’s biggest suppliers of
unoccupied residential land.  MTR Corp. (66) , Hong Kong’s railway
operator, sells land to developers for a portion of the their
profits.  To contact the reporters on this story:
