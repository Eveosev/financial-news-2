Al Horford of the  Atlanta Hawks  will
miss two to three months with a torn muscle in his left
shoulder, leaving the National Basketball Association team
without its third-leading scorer.  Horford, 25, a two-time All Star, will seek a second
opinion before deciding whether to have surgery, the team said
today in a statement. Horford was injured during yesterdayâ€™s
game against the  Indiana Pacers .  In 11 games this season, Horford has averaged 12.4 points
and seven rebounds for the Hawks, who are third in the Southeast
Division with a 7-4 record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
