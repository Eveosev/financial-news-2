Hulu LLC, the online TV service,
plans to spend $500 million on programs this year after paid
subscribers surpassed 1.5 million in 2011.  Revenue last year totaled $420 million, the Los Angeles-
based company said today on its  website . The company predicted
in April that 2011 sales would approach $500 million.  Hulu is signing up twice as many subscribers every day as
it was a year earlier,  Jason Kilar , chief executive officer,
said in the statement. Hulu is spending on shows to compete for
subscribers with  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  and for online advertisers with
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube and  Yahoo (YHOO)  Inc.  Hulu’s owners, which include  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC, News
Corp.’s Fox and  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC, called off an auction of the
website in October, saying the strategic value of the business
outweighed the benefits of a potential sale.  In  July , the company predicted total subscribers would top
1 million during the third quarter.  More than half of revenue will come from the $7.99-a-month
Hulu Plus service later this year, Kilar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
