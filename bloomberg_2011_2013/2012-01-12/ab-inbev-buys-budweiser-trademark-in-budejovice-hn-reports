Anheuser Busch InBev NV bought parts
of Budweiser beer trademarks from Harvestor, a company that
operates a brewery in Ceske Budejovice, the Czech city that is
home to rival brewer Budejovicky Budvar NP,  Hospodarske Noviny 
reported, citing Harvestor spokesman Michal Donath.  Harvestor, which spun off the trademarks from its other
beer assets in Ceske Budejovice before the sale, will continue
to produce beer in its Samson brewery in the Czech city,
Hospodarske added.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
