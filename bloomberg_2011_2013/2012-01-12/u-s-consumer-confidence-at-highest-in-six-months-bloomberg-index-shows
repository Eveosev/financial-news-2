Consumer confidence  in the U.S. last
week reached the highest level since July as the improving job
market helped allay pessimism.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort  Index (COMFCOMF)  was minus 44.7 in the
period ended Jan. 8 from minus 44.8 the prior week. As recently
as October, the index registered its lowest readings since the
2007-2009 recession, making 2011 the second-worst year in 25
years of data. It’s since increased in four of the past five
weeks.  “Considering where it’s been, the trend is a welcome
one,”  Gary Langer , president of Langer Research Associates LLC
in New York, which compiles the index for Bloomberg, said in a
statement. “Sentiment is hardly on a predictable path, given
factors including the uncertainty of the 2012 presidential
election, volatility in global markets and economic question
marks from  Europe  to  China .”  Less unemployment and growing payrolls may be lifting
consumers’ moods, providing the spark for increases in consumer
spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy.
Nonetheless, gasoline prices that are once again rising and wage
gains that  fail  to keep pace with inflation may be obstacles to
greater improvement in confidence.  Other reports today showed retail sales rose less than
forecast in December and claims for jobless benefits climbed
more than projected in the first week of the year.  Retail Sales  Purchases increased 0.1 percent last month after a 0.4
percent advance in November that was more than initially
reported, Commerce Department figures showed. Economists
forecast a 0.3 percent December rise, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Purchases excluding
automobiles fell 0.2 percent, the first decline since May 2010.  The number of applications for  unemployment benefits 
climbed by 24,000 to 399,000 in the week ended Jan. 7, Labor
Department figures showed. The median forecast of 46 economists
in a Bloomberg survey projected 375,000.  Stocks rose as sales of  government securities  in Spain and
 Italy  eased concern the countries would struggle to finance
their debts. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1 percent
to 1,293.76 at 9:40 a.m. in New York.  The comfort survey’s gauge of Americans’ views of the
current state of the  economy  rose to minus 82.1 last week from
minus 82.9 in the prior period. The  buying climate  index held at
minus 49.4, and the measure of personal  finances  decreased to
minus 2.6 from minus 2.2.  The gain in the cumulative Bloomberg index last week was
within the survey’s three-point margin of error.  More Jobs  Better employment opportunities are probably holding up
confidence. Payrolls increased by 200,000 in December, and the
jobless rate dropped to 8.5 percent, the lowest since February
2009, a Labor Department report showed last week.  Employers added 1.64 million workers in 2011, surpassing
the prior year’s 940,000 advance and the biggest gain since
2006.  Sentiment has been improving among lower-income Americans.
The index for those earning less than $15,000 per year increased
to the highest level since October, and those making up to
$24,999 were the most  optimistic  since February.  The ebbing of pessimism was also evident among older
households. The measure of confidence among those older than 65
rose to minus 39.9, the best reading since April.  Brighter moods may help drive  consumer spending  in 2012
following the  holiday shopping season .  ‘Extremely Pleased’  “We are extremely pleased with our December sales results
as we significantly exceeded our expectations,” Sherry Lang, a
spokeswoman for TJX Cos. said in Jan. 5 conference call. Sales
at the Framingham, Massachusetts-based retailer increased 8
percent last month. “Further, we entered January with very lean
inventories and the flexibility to ship fresh merchandise at
great values to our stores.”  The gain in the Bloomberg index parallels improvement in
other surveys. The Conference Board’s confidence gauge  increased 
in December to the highest level since April. That same month
the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer
confidence  rose  to the highest level since June.  Nonetheless, rising gasoline prices may constrain
sentiment. The cost of a regular gallon of fuel at the pump
 climbed  to $3.38 yesterday, up 5.5 percent from a 10-month low
reached on Dec. 20, according to data from AAA, the nation’s
largest auto group.  “While the recent trend in consumer confidence is
encouraging, risks remain,” said  Joseph Brusuelas , a senior
economist at Bloomberg LP in  New York . “The recent rise in
gasoline prices is likely to act as a restraint on improving
consumer confidence in January.”  Annual Averages  Bloomberg’s comfort index, which began in December 1985,
averaged minus 46.8 for all of last year, second only to 2009’s
minus 47.9 as the worst year on record. The gauge averaged minus
45.7 for 2010.  The Consumer Comfort Index is based on responses to
telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,000 consumers 18
years old and over. Each week, 250 respondents are asked for
their views on the economy, personal finances and buying
climate; the percentage of negative responses for each measure
is subtracted from the share of positive views. The results are
then summed and divided by three. The most recent reading is
based on the average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative.
