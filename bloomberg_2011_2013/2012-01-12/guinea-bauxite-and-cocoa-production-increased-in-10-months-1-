Bauxite production in  Guinea , the
world’s biggest exporter of the ore, rose 5.7 percent to 14.3
million metric tons in the year through October, according to
the country’s Finance Ministry. Cocoa also climbed.  Output of alumina increased to 509,410 tons compared with
483,450 tons in the same period in 2010, the Conakry-based
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  Gold production fell 35 percent to 426,020 ounces, while
diamond output declined 23 percent to 224,260 carats from
290,890 carats a year earlier, the ministry said.  Natural resources account for about 46 percent of gross
domestic product in Guinea as the West African nation seeking to
curb inflation and boost economic growth in the second year of
the administration of Alpha Conde, the country’s first
democratically elected leader.  Cocoa production in Guinea, which neighbors the world’s top
grower  Ivory Coast , soared to 31,690 tons in the period from
4,500 tons a year earlier, according to the ministry. Coffee
output was little changed at 23,420 tons.  Palm-oil production rose 66 percent to 8,450 tons while
cement unloaded at the main port at Conakry dropped 26 percent
to 357,700 tons, the data showed.  Companies including  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) 
and Aluminum Corp. of China operate in Guinea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
