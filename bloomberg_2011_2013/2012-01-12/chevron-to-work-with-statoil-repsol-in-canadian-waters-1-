Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and
 Repsol YPF SA (REP)  agreed to jointly drill oil exploration wells off
Canada’s Arctic and Atlantic coasts.  The Canadian division of San Ramon, California-based
Chevron will work with Stavanger, Norway-based Statoil and
Madrid-based Repsol to explore for oil in the Orphan Basin off
the coast of Newfoundland, with Chevron controlling 65 percent
of the project, the U.S. oil and gas producer said today in a
statement.  The companies will also cooperate on drilling wells in the
Flemish Pass Basin, while Chevron and Statoil will cooperate in
the Beaufort Sea.  Newfoundland holds more than a quarter of Canada’s
conventional oil reserves, according to the website of the
government of Newfoundland. Offshore oil production has made the
province the fastest-growing economy in Canada, according to the
 U.S. Geological Survey .  In the Arctic, including parts controlled by Canada,
companies are eyeing oil reserves that may be as large as 90
billion barrels, the U.S. Geological Survey said in 2008.  “Strengthening our position in the Flemish Pass Basin and
obtaining early entrance to the Orphan Basin and Beaufort Sea
provides us access to large potential resources,” said Statoil
Vice President Tim Dodson in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
