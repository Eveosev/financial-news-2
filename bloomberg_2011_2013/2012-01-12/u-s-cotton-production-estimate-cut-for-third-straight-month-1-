The U.S. cut its cotton-crop
estimate for a third straight month on declines in  Texas , where
the worst drought in at least a century reduced production.
Forecasts for global production and demand were also lowered.  U.S.  output  will total 15.67 million bales in the harvest
that started in August, down from 15.83 million projected last
month, the Department of Agriculture said today in a report.
Nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected 15.76 million,
on average. The previous crop was 18.1 million bales.  Texas, the biggest U.S. cotton grower, recorded the driest
October-September period since record-keeping started in 1895,
according to the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln,
 Nebraska . The USDA also cut its estimate for U.S. exports and
for use in China, the world’s biggest consumer, boosting the
outlook for inventories.  “Consumption was cut in China and a host of Asian
importers,” Chris Kramedjian, a senior risk-management
consultant at INTL FCStone in Nashville,  Tennessee , said in a
report. “The cuts in consumption were only partially offset by
lower production in the U.S. and  India .”  Cotton futures for March delivery fell 1.7 percent to 95.25
cents a pound at 11:21 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York ,
heading for the biggest drop since Dec. 14. Before today, prices
slumped 56 percent from a record $2.197 reached in March as
world economies slowed.  The U.S., the largest exporter, may ship 11 million bales
in the marketing year that began on Aug. 1, compared with last
month’s forecast for 11.3 million, the USDA said. The agency
attributed the decline partly to overseas competition.  Stockpiles Increase  U.S. stockpiles  at the end of the season will total 3.7
million bales, up from the agency’s prior estimate of 3.5
million, according to the report. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or
218 kilograms.  China  will import 16 million bales, up from 15.5 million
forecast in December. At the same time, the USDA cut its
projection for Chinese use to 44 million bales from 45 million
in the previous estimate.  “Consumption is estimated 1 million bales lower for China,
as the substantial accumulation of cotton in the national
reserve is expected to support prices and constrain mill use,”
the agency said in the report. China is the world’s top grower,
consumer and importer.  World output  will be 122.84 million bales, less than last
month’s forecast of 123.42 million, the USDA said. Production
was cut mainly in the U.S. and India, the world’s second-biggest
grower.  Global use will be 109.99 million bales, down from the
projection of 111.34 million in December, the USDA said. World
stockpiles as of July 31 will total 58.35 million bales,
compared with the previous estimate of 57.67 million, the agency
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
