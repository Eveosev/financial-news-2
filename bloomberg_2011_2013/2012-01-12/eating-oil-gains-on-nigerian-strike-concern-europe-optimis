Gasoline slid, reversing an earlier
gain, after a report that a European Union embargo on imports of
Iranian oil may be delayed six months, according to an EU
official with knowledge of the talks.  Futures fell 1.2 percent. The delay will allow countries
such as Italy and  Spain  to find alternative supply, the EU
official said, declining to be identified because the talks are
private. The embargo would need to be approved by the 27 nation-
bloc’s foreign ministers on Jan. 23.  “The story saying the embargo is going to be delayed six
months kicked this off and we saw liquidation selling,” said
 Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for February delivery fell 3.2 cents to settle at
$2.7313 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
touching $2.8245.  Crude oil contract tumbled $1.77 to $99.10, the first
settlement below $100 since Dec. 30.  EU members, including France and  Germany , have pushed for
an embargo to pressure  Iran  over its nuclear program. Iran, the
second-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, pumped 3.58 million barrels of crude a day
last month, according to Bloomberg News estimates.  Iran has threatened to block oil shipments through the
Strait of Hormuz, a conduit for about 20 percent of the world’s
traded oil, if sanctions are imposed.  February-delivery heating oil declined 1.05 cents, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $3.0541 a gallon, after touching $3.1364.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1
cent to $3.382 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices
are the highest since Nov. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
