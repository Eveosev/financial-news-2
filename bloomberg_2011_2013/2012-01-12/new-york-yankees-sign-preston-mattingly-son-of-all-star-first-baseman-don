Preston Mattingly, the son of former
 New York  Yankees first baseman and current Los Angeles Dodgers
manager  Don Mattingly , was signed by the Yankees.  The younger Mattingly, an outfielder, will report to the
club’s minor league spring training camp, the team said in a
news release yesterday.  Preston Mattingly, 24, was drafted by the Dodgers with the
31st pick in the first round of the 2006 Major League Baseball
amateur draft. He had a .232 batting average in the minor
leagues in 2011, finishing the season with the Rancho Cucamonga
Quakes, the Dodgers’ advanced Class-A affiliate. After starting
his pro career as a shortstop, he’s moved to second base and
then outfield in recent seasons.  Don Mattingly played his entire 14-year career for the
Yankees, retiring in 1995 with a career .307 batting average,
222 home runs and 1,099 runs batted in. He was selected as an
All-Star six times and won nine Gold Glove Awards for his play
at first base.  Mattingly became a hitting coach for the Yankees before
leaving with  Joe Torre  to join the Dodgers in November 2007. He
took over as manager when Torre resigned in September 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
