Target Corp. (TGT)  will buy back as much
as $5 billion of its shares as the second-largest U.S. discount
retailer forecasts it will generate more cash than needed to
invest in its stores.  Repurchases under the new authorization will start after
the current $10 billion program ends early this year, the
Minneapolis-based company said in a statement today. Target
expects to complete the new $5 billion authorization in the next
two to three years.  “Our plans envision continued generation of much more cash
than we believe is appropriate to invest in our core
businesses,” Chief Financial Officer Doug Scovanner said in the
statement.  Target, led by Chief Executive Officer  Gregg Steinhafel ,
said the pace of share repurchases will likely increase after
capital investments to introduce stores in  Canada  decline. The
stores in Canada are expected to open in 2013.  The company expects the annual dividend to rise to $3 or
more by 2017, based on its ability to boost yearly earnings per
share to $8 or more by that time, according to the statement.
Target’s next quarterly dividend will be 30 cents a share.  Target said profit in the fourth quarter would be $1.35 a
share to $1.43 a share, less than an earlier forecast for profit
of $1.43 to $1.53, according to a statement Jan. 5. The average
estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.40.  Target  rose  1.6 percent to $49.81 at the close in  New York .
The shares dropped 15 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
