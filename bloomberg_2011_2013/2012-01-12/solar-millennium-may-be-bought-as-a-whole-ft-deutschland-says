Solar Millennium AG may be bought as
a whole, as there are strategic as well as financial investors
interested in acquiring the company,  Financial Times Deutschland

administrator.  The due diligence process could start next week, Boehm
said, the newspaper reported. Ferrostaal AG as well as an
unnamed construction company are among the parties interested,
