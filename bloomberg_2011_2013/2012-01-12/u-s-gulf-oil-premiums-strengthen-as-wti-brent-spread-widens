U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums widened
as West Texas Intermediate’s discount to Brent, the European
benchmark, widened for a second day.  The spread widened 79 cents to $12.16 a barrel based on
settlement prices. When Brent increases versus WTI, it
strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete
with West African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Among Gulf Coast grades,  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to
WTI added 20 cents to $10.95 a barrel at 3:15 p.m. in  New York .
 Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium gained 50 cents to $12.75 over
the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $10.75. Mars
Blend’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $8.25.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium
was unchanged at $8 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  added 15 cents to $7.90 over WTI.
 West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount narrowed 40 cents to $3.10 a barrel.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI widened 50 cents to
$21.50.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount widened 35 cents to $3.25. Syncrude is
a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in
 Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
