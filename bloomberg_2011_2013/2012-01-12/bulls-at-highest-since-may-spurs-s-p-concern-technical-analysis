The 12 percent rally in the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  since November has pushed optimism to a level
last seen when the U.S. stock market began its biggest retreat
since 2009.  The proportion of investment newsletter writers who are
optimistic on equities rose to 51.1 percent this week, the
highest since May, according to a report from New Rochelle, New
York-based Investors Intelligence yesterday. Last year’s peak in
bullishness was just before the market’s top in April.  Some analysts say sentiment serves as a contrary indicator
given that optimistic investors have already purchased shares,
leaving less money to help drive prices higher. The S&P 500 has
climbed in four out of the past six weeks, touching a five-month
intraday high of 1,296.46 on Jan. 10, as data on manufacturing
and employment raised optimism the world’s largest economy will
weather  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  “Sentiment is getting more extreme,” Arthur Huprich, an
analyst with Raymond James & Associates Inc., wrote in a note
yesterday. “Trading will remain choppy, especially as
overhanging selling pressure looms.”  Bulls reached 57.3 percent on April 5, 2011. At the end of
that month, the S&P 500 hit its 2011 peak at 1,363.61 before
plunging as much as 19 percent through October. It has since
jumped 18 percent to 1,292.48.  Michael Krauss, head of technical research at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., said S&P 500 faces “resistance” at the 1,305 to
1,318 range. A failure to break through these levels may lead to
a loss of 50 to 100 points in the  S&P 500 , he said.  “The sentiment in the market is somewhat hopeful, but
there is a lot of fear in the background,” he said in a
telephone interview yesterday. “I’m not expecting a crash, but
I could see a risk-off trade in February, March.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
