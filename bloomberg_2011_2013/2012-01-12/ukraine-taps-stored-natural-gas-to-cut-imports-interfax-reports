Ukraine is boosting  natural-gas 
volumes taken from underground storage to replace imports from
 Russia , Interfax-Ukraine reported, citing an unidentified
government official familiar with the matter.  As of Jan. 9, Ukraine was pumping a daily average of 102.8
million cubic meters of natural gas from storage and importing
33.3 million cubic meters from Russia, the news service said.  This compares with a daily average of 61 million cubic
meters from storage and 95 million cubic meters for imports a
month earlier, Interfax reported. The “significant” increase
began on Jan. 5, the news service said.  Ukraine had 15.7 billion cubic meters of gas in the storage
on Jan. 9, enough to last to the end of the heating season, the
newswire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
