The  European Investment Bank  cut its
supply of 2013 carbon permits by 80 percent on Dec. 20, the same
day the price of the benchmark 2012 contract posted a record
one-day jump and recorded all-time high trading volume.  The bank, mandated to sell permits on behalf of the
European Union to raise funds for  carbon capture  and renewable
energy projects for climate protection, cut supply to 200,000
metric tons on Dec. 20 from 1 million tons a day earlier,
according to a  statement published  yesterday.  The 2012 contract surged a record 21 percent on ICE Futures
 Europe  on Dec. 20 after the European Parliament’s environment
committee backed a draft rule requiring the bloc’s executive to
propose a temporary cut in permit supply. The bank sold at 9.38
euros ($11.95) a ton, 22 percent more than the price it achieved
Dec. 19, according to the statement.  The EIB sold a total of 12 million tons last month to
unspecified banks for an average 8.15 euros a ton. The
unweighted average for the December 2013 contract on ICE was 2.5
percent higher at 8.35 euros.  European carbon-permit prices for December have dropped 52
percent in the past year, as the region’s debt crisis weakened
the region’s economy while supply of offset credits from
developing nations rose. EU permits for December decreased to a
record 6.38 euros a ton last week in intraday trading on ICE and
were up 2.3 percent today at 7.20 euros as of 4:42 p.m.  ‘Historically Muted’  The bank’s sales process, the first supply for the market’s
third phase starting 2013, sought to avoid driving prices lower
by cutting volume on days that usually have low liquidity,
according to a senior EIB official speaking yesterday on a call
with reporters, who declined to be identified because of EIB
policy.  The bank cut sales to the lower level in the week before
the Christmas-holiday period and after the December 2011 future
on ICE expired on Dec. 19, because trading has been historically
muted in that period, the official said. Price was not
considered when determining volumes, he said.  The volume of trade on ICE’s 2012 contract was a record
23.1 million tons on Dec. 20. Aggregated volume across all
carbon contracts was 27.7 million, the highest since Dec. 14.  The EIB, whose new president is Werner Hoyer as of this
month, will receive fees of as much as 45 million euros for its
role in helping the EU sell allowances and choose investments,
according to a  co-operation agreement  with the commission. It
will get a fee of 15 million euros, or 5 cents a ton, for
selling a total of 300 million tons of carbon and managing the
proceeds, the agreement shows.  ‘Limiting Advantage’  The EIB’s over-the-counter transactions “will be
structured in a way to ensure best competition and limit any
information advantage to the amount executed with each market
counterpart,” the bank said in a statement on its website
updated Dec. 2. Buyers were not told sales targets, the official
said.  Companies buying 2013 carbon permits directly from the EIB
may have “privileged” information that other traders don’t
have, the International Emissions Trading Association, the
emissions trading lobby group, said on Dec. 16. The EIB official
said the bank was bound by the co-operation agreement to provide
monthly disclosure within two weeks of the end of each month.  The EIB may start direct sales to utilities as soon as this
month, he said. It may sell on exchanges this quarter and in
auctions by the middle of the year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
