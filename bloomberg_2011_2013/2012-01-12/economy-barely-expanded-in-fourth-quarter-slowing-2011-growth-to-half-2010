The U.K. economy barely expanded in
the fourth quarter, with growth in 2011 slowing to half the pace
of the previous year, the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research said.  Gross domestic product  probably rose 0.1 percent, compared
with growth of 0.3 percent in the three months through November,
Niesr, whose clients include the  Bank of England  and the U.K.
Treasury, said in an e-mailed statement in London today. The
economy grew 0.6 percent in the third quarter.  The economy probably expanded by 1 percent last year, down
from 2.1 percent growth in 2010, Niesr said.  “It is welcome news that Niesr are estimating continued
growth in the economy and there are reasons to be optimistic,”
the Treasury said in a statement, citing surveys suggesting the
services and construction industries strengthened last month.  “But we have to remember this is one estimate from one
forecaster, and we should be realistic about the risks,” it
added. “The uncertainty in the euro area continues to have a
chilling effect on the U.K. as well as elsewhere.’  The Bank of England kept its target for  bond purchases  at
275 billion pounds today ($422 billion). Citigroup Inc. and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are among banks saying it will
increase the target next month when the current round of
purchases end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
