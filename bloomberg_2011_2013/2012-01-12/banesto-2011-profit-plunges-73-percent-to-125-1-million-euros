Banco Espanol de Credito SA , a
Spanish consumer banking  unit  of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , posted a
fourth-quarter loss after it took a 280 million-euro ($356
million) charge for souring real-estate loans.  The net  loss  was 173.3 million euros, compared with a
profit of 9.46 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based
lender said in a filing to regulators today. The average
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 7.34
million-euro profit.  Banesto, the first Spanish lender to report earnings for
the period, said it took the charges to reflect trends it sees
in real estate after reducing its  loan book  by 8.6 percent in
2011. The bank is scaling back lending and setting aside more
funds to cover damaged assets amid pressure on lenders from
 Spain ’s new government to clean up their balance sheets.  “It’s going to get very difficult this year, especially
for the domestic banks, because of the provisions they’re going
to have to make” for property loans under government pressure,
said Alberto Espelosin, head of analysis at Ibercaja Gestion in
Zaragoza, Spain, said by phone.  Banesto shares rose 2.8 percent to 3.64 euros in Madrid,
valuing the bank at 2.5 billion euros, as financial stocks
rallied across  Europe . The shares slid 40 percent in 2011.  Lending Risk  Spanish banks face as much as 50 billion euros of
additional provisions as the government wants to minimize costs
to taxpayers, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said this month.  “The more that gets provisioned, the better,” Banesto
Chairman Antonio Basagoiti said at a news conference in  Madrid .
He said the property charge was decided on in recent days and
wasn’t prompted by the government, though he said the step was
judged “excellent” by the Bank of Spain.  The bank said it reduced its lending risk associated with
real estate to 6.6 billion euros at the end of 2011, down from 8
billion euros a year earlier.  The bank now classes 47 percent of its lending for real
estate as “substandard” or “doubtful,” up from 30 percent a
year earlier. Banesto now has 36 percent of its acquired or
foreclosed real-estate assets covered with provisions, compared
with 24 percent a year ago.  Redepositing ECB Funds  Bad loans as a proportion of total loans rose to 4.94
percent from 4.65 percent in September and 4.08 percent a year
earlier, the bank said. Net entries of loans into default
reached 316 million euros in the period, up from 175 million
euros in the third quarter, Banesto said.  Deposits (BTO)  shrank 15
percent from a year earlier.  Net interest income slid 14 percent from a year earlier to
323.8 million euros. The core capital ratio was 9 percent, up
from 8.3 percent a year ago, and the bank said today it aims to
keep it above that level in 2012.  Banesto tapped the three-year loans made available by the
 European Central Bank , and the funds have been “redeposited”
back at the ECB and not put to “net use,” Juan Delibes, the
company’s financial-planning director, said on a webcast for
analysts today. Banesto ended 2011 with net ECB funds of 700
million euros, down from 1.5 billion euros a year earlier, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
