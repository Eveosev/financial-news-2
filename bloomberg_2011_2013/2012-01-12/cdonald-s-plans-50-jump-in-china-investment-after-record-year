McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  plans to increase
investment in  China , its third-largest market, by 50 percent
this year after the world’s largest fast-food chain opened a
record 200 stores in 2011.  Spending will focus on opening an expected 225 to 250
outlets, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. It didn’t provide a specific figure for
its investment target.  McDonald’s is accelerating expansion in China, where it
trails  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) ’s KFC Corp. McDonald’s has more than
1,400 restaurants in the world’s second-largest economy,
according to today’s statement. KFC has more than 3,200, its
website shows.  Yum! agreed to buy Chinese hot-pot seller Little Sheep
Group Ltd. last year to extend its lead as the nation’s biggest
restaurant operator. The Louisville, Kentucky-based company also
owns the  Pizza Hut  and Taco Bell brands.  McDonald’s planned to increase investment in China by 40
percent in 2011 and open 175-200 restaurants, the company said
in Dec 2010.  --Michael Wei. Editor: Ben Richardson, Dave McCombs  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
