U.K. stocks  retreated for a second
day as retailers tumbled after  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  reported Christmas
sales that missed estimates and data on U.S. retail sales and
jobless claims were worse than forecast.  Tesco plunged 16 percent, the most since at least 1988,
after Britain’s largest supermarket chain also lowered its
profit forecast.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  and William Morrison
Supermarkets Plc both tumbled more than 5 percent.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  Index fell 8.4, or 0.2 percent, to
5,662.42 at the close in  London , even as two stocks gained for
each that fell. The broader FTSE All-Share Index was little
changed, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 1 percent in Dublin.  “Doom and gloom within the retail sector has driven stock
markets lower today,” said  Angus Campbell , head of sales at
Capital Spreads. “Investors don’t like seeing a massive
bellwether stock like Tesco issuing profits warnings and it’s
always going to have a knock on effect for the wider market.”  Stocks extended losses today after separate reports showed
more Americans than forecast filed applications for  unemployment
benefits  last week, while sales at  U.S. retailers  rose 0.1
percent in December, missing the average economist forecast for
a 0.3 percent gain.  The Bank of England refrained from adding to emergency
stimulus today as policy makers await new forecasts and the
economy showed some resilience heading into 2012. The Monetary
Policy Committee maintained its bond-purchase target at 275
billion pounds ($421 billion), which was forecast by all but one
of 41 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Tesco Slides  Tesco had the biggest drop in the  FTSE 100 , sinking 16
percent to 323.45 pence after the retailer said full-year profit
will be at the “low end of the current consensus range” and
next year will see “minimal” growth in  earnings .        U.K.
sales at stores open at least a year dropped 2.3 percent,
excluding fuel and value-added tax, in the six weeks ended Jan.
7. That fell short of the median estimate of 10 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg for a 1 percent decline.  Rival supermarket chains declined. Sainsbury retreated 5.4
percent to 285.9 pence and Morrison tumbled 6 percent to 285.9
pence.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , Britain’s largest clothing
retailer, slipped 2 percent to 315.6 pence.  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME)  dropped 4.9 percent to 83 pence after
the owner of the Argos and Homebase chains forecast a drop in
annual profit as holiday sales slumped and said it plans a
“significant” dividend cut.  Ocado Gains  In contrast,  Ocado Group Plc (OCDO)  soared 33 percent to 74 pence
after revenue at the U.K.’s largest online-only grocer
accelerated in the Christmas season led by sales of its own-
label items.  Elsewhere,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  led a gauge of
U.K. lenders higher as the cost for European banks to borrow in
dollars eased to a four-month low.  RBS jumped 5.6 percent to 23 pence. Britain’s biggest
government-owned lender said it will cut 3,500 jobs at its
investment bank over the next three years and will either sell
or close its cash equities and mergers advisory operations along
with its corporate broking and equity capital markets units. The
lender said it’s in talks with “a number” of buyers for the
division.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  rallied 3.5 percent to 29.15
pence,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  increased 1.7 percent to 193.45 pence.  Mining Companies Gain  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  led copper producers higher, gaining
4.7 percent to 1,064 pence.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  added 2.4 percent to
1,051 pence and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  rallied 2 percent to 1,307
pence. Copper rose on the London Metal Exchange after figures
showed Chinese inflation cooled to a 15-month low, adding to
speculation the government may have room to ease monetary policy
to help spur growth.  Elsewhere,  Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM)  advanced 4.6 percent to 340.8
pence after the  fund manager  reported a 2.5 percent gain in
assets under management for the second quarter to $60.4 billion.  Provident Financial Plc climbed 4.8 percent to 995.5 pence
after the company said it expects full-year earnings to be in
line with estimates. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods raised its
recommendation for the lender to “market perform” from
“underperform,” while Numis Corp. upgraded the shares to
“buy” from “hold.”  Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV)  jumped 11 percent to 107.2 pence
after the U.K.’s largest homebuilder by volume reported an 8
percent gain in first-half revenue to about 950 million pounds
as the average price of its homes rose.  Rival  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  increased 3.4 percent to 516.5 pence
and  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  advanced 2 percent to 39.54 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
