Colombia’s peso advanced to an
almost four-month high amid increased foreign investment flows
into the South American country.  The peso climbed 0.6 percent to 1,838.35 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,850 yesterday. Earlier it touched 1,835.90, the strongest
level since Sept. 19. The peso has jumped 5.5 percent so far
this year, the best performance among world currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  “The peso has been strengthening at an accelerated and at
times disorderly pace,” said Andres Munoz, the head currency
trader at financial services holding company Corp. Financiera
Colombiana, known as Corficolombiana, in Bogota. “Colombia’s
good fundamentals and the interest rate differential are
attracting oil and portfolio flows from abroad.”  Foreign direct investment jumped 56 percent to $14.8
billion in 2011 from a year earlier, with 82 percent going into
oil and mining, according to preliminary trade balance data from
the central bank. Foreign investment into stocks and bonds
jumped almost four-fold to $989 million in the last three months
of 2011 from $263 million in the third quarter, according to the
central bank data.  Gains in the peso may ease as it approaches 1,835, which is
a resistance level, said Munoz.  Colombia ’s economy expanded 7.7 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace since the fourth
quarter of 2006. The economy may grow as much as 6 percent in
2011, the fastest pace since 2007, according to the central
bank.  Dollar Bonds  Policy makers in November raised the key rate a quarter
percentage point to 4.75 percent, citing the need to bolster the
central bank’s credibility after “strong” growth drove up
inflation expectations, according to minutes of the meeting. The
central bank left the rate unchanged in the Dec. 16 meeting.  Meanwhile in the U.S., the  Federal Reserve  has pledged to
hold  interest rates  near zero until at least mid-2013.  Colombia sold $1.5 billion of securities due 2041 yesterday
to yield 4.964 percent, in its first overseas offering since
July, to help finance 2012 budget needs in dollars and fund a
debt buyback. The government won’t bring in proceeds from the
sale into the local market, the  Finance Ministry  said in a
statement yesterday.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.39
percent, according to the stock exchange. The price on the peso
bonds, known as TES, rose 0.453 centavo to 120.772 centavos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
