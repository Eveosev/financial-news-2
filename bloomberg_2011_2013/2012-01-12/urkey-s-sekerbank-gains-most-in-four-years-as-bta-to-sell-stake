Turkish lender  Sekerbank TAS (SKBNK)  jumped
the most in more than four years after  BTA Bank JSC (BTAS)  of
 Kazakhstan  said it expects to complete an agreement to sell its
34 percent stake for $166 million “very soon.”  Sekerbank climbed as much as 13 percent, the most since
November 2008, to 99 kurus and traded up 5.7 percent at 93 kurus
as of 4:48 p.m. in Istanbul.  BTA will sell the Sekerbank stake to Kazakhstan’s national
wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, the bank said in a presentation
published on its website.  The deal values the Turkish bank at $488 million. Its
current market value is 910 million liras ($492 million)
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The sale announcement comes as BTA’s capital shortfall is
expected to reach $5.1 billion by the end of the year, according
to the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
