The U.K.’s upper House of Lords
voted down three proposals from Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
government aimed at cutting welfare costs by stopping payments
to cancer sufferers and disabled people with savings.  In three votes yesterday evening, opposition Labour and
independent members of the unelected chamber voted to amend the
plans, defeating the coalition government, which has no majority
in the upper house.  Welfare minister David Freud said that not to implement so-
called “means tests” for disabled people, as well as those
recovering from cancer and strokes, after making payments for 12
months would cost 1.6 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) over five
years. The Lords voted that these tests should have to be
delayed for at least two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
