OAO Gazprom may spend as much as 180
billion rubles ($5.7 billion) to build sporting facilities and
infrastructure and to support athletes for the 2014 Winter
 Olympic Games  in south  Russia ,  Vedomosti  reported, citing the
gas producerâ€™s budget.  The costs have risen more than fourfold since 2009 when

into the Olympics in Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea
coast, the Moscow-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
