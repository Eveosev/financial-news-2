Switzerland  is threatened by foreign
legal action that transgresses the nation’s sovereignty,
according to Nicolas Pictet, president of the 13-member Swiss
Private Bankers Association.  “It’s an intolerable threat for a small export country
like Switzerland,” Pictet, who is also a managing partner at
Geneva’s biggest private bank, Pictet & Cie., told reporters in
Bern today. “We must remain very vigilant.”  The U.S. is in talks with the Alpine country to resolve a
dispute over offshore  tax evasion  that last week led to the
indictment of three client advisers at Switzerland’s oldest
private bank, Wegelin & Co. The U.S.  Justice Department  set a
deadline of Jan. 23 for 11 Swiss banks to disclose information
on all transactions with U.S. customers since 2000, Neue
Zuercher Zeitung reported Jan. 8.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank,
said last July that it was a target of U.S. prosecutors.  “There is very significant pressure from the U.S. on a
certain number of institutions to clean up the situation and
make sure they don’t shelter any U.S. undeclared clients,”
Pictet said in an interview in Bern, without naming any banks.
“This has been a very worrying situation. The amount of
pressure is extremely high.”  The Swiss government has said it wants to find a
comprehensive solution to end U.S. criminal probes while
preserving its decades-old tradition of banking secrecy.
