European stocks  declined after
reports that showed U.S. retail sales and initial jobless claims
missed economists’ forecasts outweighed lower borrowing costs at
Spanish and Italian debt auctions.  Tesco Plc dropped 16 percent, leading retail shares lower,
after the U.K.’s largest supermarket chain said it was
“disappointed” with holiday sales. Vestas Wind Systems A/S and
 Delhaize Group SA (DELB)  tumbled. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc rose
5.6 percent after announcing job cuts.  Sulzer AG (SUN) , the world’s
second-largest maker of pumps, added 5.1 percent after saying
full-year orders increased 14 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.2 percent to 249.50 at
the close in  London . The gauge had earlier advanced as much as
0.9 percent after Spain and  Italy  sold debt, raising their
targeted amounts at lower yields.  The benchmark measure has still advanced 2 percent since
the beginning of this year as economic reports around the world
added to optimism the global economy can withstand the euro
area’s debt crisis.  National benchmark indexes rose in 13 of  Europe ’s 18
western markets.  France ’s CAC 40 Index slipped 0.2 percent and
the  U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index  fell 0.2 percent, while  Germany ’s DAX
Index climbed 0.4 percent.  U.S. Economy  In the U.S., a report showed that more Americans than
forecast filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last week,
raising the possibility that a greater-than-usual increase in
temporary holiday hiring boosted December payrolls.  Jobless claims climbed by 24,000 to 399,000 in the week
ended Jan. 7, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 46 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey projected 375,000.  Sales at  U.S. retailers  in December rose less than
forecast, restrained by cheaper fuel prices and holiday
discounting that helped hold down the value of goods sold.  The 0.1 percent gain followed a 0.4 percent advance in
November that was more than initially reported, Commerce
Department figures showed today. Economists forecast a 0.3
percent December rise, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. Purchases excluding automobiles fell 0.2
percent.  The U.S. economic expansion improved last month across most
of the country, while hiring was limited and housing remained
stagnant, the Fed said yesterday in the first edition of its
 Beige Book  in 2012.  Debt Auctions  Spain  auctioned 9.98 billion euros ($12.7 billion) of bonds
maturing in 2015 and 2016, including a new three-year benchmark
security, twice the maximum target of 5 billion euros set for
the sale. The yield on the three-year notes was 3.384 percent,
compared with 5.187 percent when the nation sold similar notes
in December.  Italy sold 12 billion euros of Treasury bills, meeting its
target, and its borrowing costs plunged. The Rome-based Treasury
sold 8.5 billion euros one-year bills at a rate of 2.735
percent, down from 5.952 percent at the last auction.  “The bond auction was very good news,” said Bernard Delattre, president of Altimeo Asset Management in Paris. “It’s
a sign of stabilization to see short-term interest rates decline
in Italy.”  In the U.K., the  Bank of England  maintained its benchmark
 interest rate  at 0.5 percent and its asset-purchase plan at 275
billion pounds ($422 billion). Both decisions matched
economists’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The  European Central Bank  kept the benchmark interest rate
at a record low of 1 percent, as predicted by 47 of 53
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Retailers Retreat  Tesco tumbled 16 percent to 323.45 pence, the largest
decline since at least 1988. The company said sales declined in
the six weeks to Jan. 7 and that profit would be at the “low
end of the current consensus range.” U.K. sales at stores open
at least a year fell 2.3 percent, excluding fuel and value-added
tax, during the period.  A gauge of retail shares in the Stoxx 600 slid 5.7 percent
for the  biggest drop  since October 2008.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  lost
5.4 percent to 285.9 pence. William Morrison Supermarkets Plc,
the smallest of the U.K.’s four main food retailers, retreated 6
percent to 285.9 pence. Home Retail Group Plc lost 4.9 percent
to 83 pence.  Delhaize dropped 11 percent to 41.78 euros. The owner of
Food Lion supermarkets plans to cut about 5,000 positions and
expects a 2.4 percent drop in revenue as it closes stores in the
U.S. and Europe. Costs related to the closures will hurt
earnings by about 205 million euros starting in the first
quarter, the Brussels-based company said.  Vestas lost 7.1 percent to 58.50 kroner. The biggest wind-
turbine maker said it’s cutting 2,335 jobs worldwide and a
further 1,600 posts are at risk in the U.S. this year as a tax
credit expires.  RBS Job Cuts  RBS advanced 5.6 percent to 23 pence. Britain’s biggest
government-owned lender will cut 3,500 jobs at its investment
bank over the next three years as it exits its unprofitable cash
equities and mergers advisory operations.  RBS said it will sell or close the units, along with its
corporate broking and equity capital markets operations. The
bank also said it cut a further 2,000 positions in the second
half of last year.  UniCredit (UCG)  SpA climbed 14 percent to 2.90 euros. The stock
was raised to “buy” from “neutral” at Citigroup Inc., which
said the stock would suit a high-risk investment strategy as it
offers significant “upside potential.”  Sulzer, Petroplus  Sulzer jumped 5.1 percent to 112.50 Swiss francs. The
company said 2011 orders rose 14 percent, or 8.4 percent
nominally, to 3.6 billion francs ($3.8 billion).  Petroplus Holdings AG surged 16 percent to 1.39 francs, the
most since November 2006. Europe’s largest independent refiner
has reached a temporary agreement with lenders to renegotiate
its debts and maintain operations at its Coryton and Ingolstadt
refineries.  Solar shares gained after a government body said  China 
plans to double solar capacity this year. The head of China’s
National Energy Administration, Liu Tienan, said yesterday that
the country will install 3 gigawatts in 2012.  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , the second-biggest maker of solar-grade
silicon, advanced 6 percent to 78 euros.  Solarworld AG (SWV) ,
Germany’s largest solar-panel maker, rose 10.4 percent to 3.96
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
