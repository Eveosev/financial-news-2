Ezz Steel (ESRS) ,  Egypt â€™s biggest publicly
traded steel manufacturer, headed for the highest close in more
than three weeks on a report the government will hand back its
court-revoked production licenses in exchange for a fee.  Shares of Ezz advanced 1.5 percent at 11:10 a.m. in Cairo,
heading for the highest close since Dec. 21. The stock plunged
81 percent in 2011, compared with a 49 percent drop for the
benchmark  EGX 30 Index .  The government has proposed that four companies, including
Ezz Steel, pay a combined 1.47 billion pounds ($240 million) to
take back their licenses,  Al Shorouk  reported today. They will
be allowed to pay 15 percent up front and the rest over five
years, the Cairo-based newspaper said. Ezz will need to pay 660
million pounds for the two licenses affected by the ruling, the
newspaper said.  The licenses had been revoked because of irregularities in
the awarding process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
