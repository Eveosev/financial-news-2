Broadwind Energy Inc. (BWEN) , a U.S. maker
of wind-turbine towers, jumped the most in three weeks after
announcing a $23 million sale.  Broadwind  gained  7.4 percent to 72 cents at the close in
New York, the biggest increase since Dec. 20. The shares have
declined 69 percent in the past year.  The tower order was Broadwind’s first from “a leading U.S.
wind-turbine manufacturer,” which it did not identify. The
towers will be produced at Broadwind’s Manitowoc, Wisconsin,
plant and delivered in the second half of 2012, the Naperville,
Illinois-based company said in a statement today.  “Fourth-quarter orders were strong across each of our
business segments including gearing, towers and services,”
Chief Executive Officer Peter Duprey said in the statement. “We
are well positioned for revenue growth in 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
