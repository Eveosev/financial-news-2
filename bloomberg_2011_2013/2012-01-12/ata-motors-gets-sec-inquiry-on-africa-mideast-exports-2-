Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the Indian owner
of Jaguar Land Rover, said it received an inquiry from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission on some of its exports.  “The SEC wanted details of our exports to Africa and the
 Middle East ,” said Debasis Ray, a spokesman for Mumbai-based
Tata Motors. Ray declined to name the countries that the SEC
wanted information about and why the agency inquired about
exports to those countries.  Tata Motors, which said today in a statement it will
respond to the SEC within 10 working days, exported 58,044
vehicles, or 7.2 percent of total sales, during the year ended
March 31, 2011, according to its website. The Indian company,
which makes the Nano, the world’s cheapest car, doesn’t break
down exports by geography.  SEC spokesman  John Nester  declined to comment.  Tata Motors American depositary receipts fell 1.1 percent
to $19.76 at the close in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
