Latvia’s parliament confirmed
Kristaps Zakulis as head of the country’s bank regulator, about
a month after the previous director resigned following the
suspension of the country’s sixth-biggest lender.  The parliament voted 73-3 with 17 abstaining in a secret
ballot to confirm Zakulis today. He had previously worked as
head of security for state-owned telecommunications company SIA
Lattelecom.  Irena Krumane, the former director of the regulator,
resigned on Nov. 28 following the suspension of Latvijas
Krajbanka AS, the country’s sixth-biggest deposit bank and
accusations of missing money at the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
