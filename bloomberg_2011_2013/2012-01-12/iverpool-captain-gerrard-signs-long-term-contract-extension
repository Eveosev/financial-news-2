Liverpool captain  Steven Gerrard 
signed a contract extension, the Premier League soccer club said
on its website.  Liverpool didn’t disclose length of the agreement, only
calling it “long term.” The midfielder in 2009 signed a two-
year extension until 2013.  “I am living the dream as the captain of one of the
biggest clubs in the world,” Gerrard, 31, said. “To extend
that and to hopefully have some more good times in a red shirt
is what I want.”  Gerrard has appeared in just 10 matches this season because
of a groin injury. He scored the only goal last night as
Liverpool beat Manchester City 1-0 in the first leg of their
Carling Cup semifinal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
