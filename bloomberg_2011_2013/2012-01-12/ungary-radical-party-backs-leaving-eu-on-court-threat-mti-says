Hungary ’s radical nationalist Jobbik
party backs quitting the European Union after the bloc’s
executive said it may sue Hungary for possible violations of the
independence of the central bank, the judiciary and the data
protection office,  MTI  reported.  Jobbik is defending “Hungary’s sovereignty” and not the
specific laws, party leader Gabor Vona said yesterday, according
to the state news service.  Jobbik has surged in polls and is now tied for second place
among decided voters, pollster Szonda Ipsos said on Dec. 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
