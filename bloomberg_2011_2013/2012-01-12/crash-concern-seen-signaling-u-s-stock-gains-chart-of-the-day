Individual investors are so
concerned about the risk of a U.S. stock-market crash that the
pessimism signals share prices are poised to rise, according to
Bespoke Investment Group LLC.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the performance of a crash-
confidence index, compiled by the  Yale School of Management ,
with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the past decade. Yale’s
gauge shows the percentage of individuals that expect the market
to avoid a 1929- or 1987-style plunge in the next six months.  Confidence dropped to lows in November 2002 and April 2009,
a month after the two most recent bull markets in stocks began.
Last November’s reading, the latest available, was the lowest
since the latter month. The figures are based on six-month
averages of monthly survey results.  Small investors are “truly spooked,” Bespoke wrote in a
 posting  on its website two days ago. “Fortunately, this is a
contrarian indicator, which provides a reason to be bullish.”  Bespoke, based in Harrison,  New York , highlighted the Yale
index along with the university’s  indicator  of confidence among
institutions. November’s figure for larger investors was 24.29,
above the 17.07 for individuals. Institutional readings have
been higher each month since November 2009.  Concern among smaller investors may help explain why money
flowed out of mutual funds focusing on U.S. stocks in 2011, the
fifth straight year of withdrawals. Last year’s total was $132
billion, based on preliminary data from the  Investment Company
Institute , a Washington-based trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
