Singapore â€™s middle-distillate
stockpiles climbed to the highest level in 10 weeks, data from
the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of  middle distillates  including gasoil
and kerosene increased 5.1 percent to 10.52 million barrels in
the week to Jan. 11, International Enterprise Singapore, a unit
of the ministry, said in an e-mailed statement today. Supplies
are at the highest since Nov. 2.  Stockpiles of  residues , a category that includes  fuel oil 
and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen, gained 0.6
percent to 16.31 million barrels.  Light distillates , including
naphtha, reformate and gasoline, declined 1.2 percent to 10.59
million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
