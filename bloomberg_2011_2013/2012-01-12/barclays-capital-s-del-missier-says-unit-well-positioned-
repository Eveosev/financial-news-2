Barclays (BARC)  Capital co-Chief Executive
Officer Jerry del Missier said the unit is “well-positioned”
for the “challenging environment” facing most securities
firms.  “We have a very strong presence in all our global markets
businesses,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview today,
adding that 2012 is going to be a better year for investment
banks than 2011.  His comments come as Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, said earlier today that
it will cut about 4,800 jobs, including 3,500 at its investment
bank over the next three years, as it jettisons unprofitable
cash equities and merger-advisory operations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
