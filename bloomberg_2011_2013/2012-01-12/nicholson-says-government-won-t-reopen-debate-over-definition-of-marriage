Canadian Justice Minister Rob
Nicholson said the government has “no intention” of reopening
the debate on same-sex marriage in the country.  Nicholson issued the statement after the Globe and Mail
newspaper reported on a case in which a same-sex couple was
denied a divorce on the grounds that their marriage in  Canada 
was not recognized outside the country.  The government is looking at ways to “clarify the law so
that such marriages performed in Canada can be undone in
Canada,” Nicholson said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
