Alliance One International Inc. (AOI) 
should lose a challenge at the European Union’s highest court
over antitrust fines levied for fixing the prices paid to
Spanish growers for tobacco, an adviser to the region’s top
court said.  The EU’s Court of Justice should uphold a fine of 1.8
million euros ($2.3 million) levied on Alliance One and its
subsidiary Standard Commercial Tobacco Co. by the  European
Commission  for their liability concerning another unit’s
involvement in the cartel, said Advocate General Juliane Kokott
in a non-binding opinion today. The court follows this advice,
at least in part, most of the time.  The European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s antitrust
regulator, in October 2004 fined five companies a total of 20
million euros for price-fixing and production-sharing between
1996 and 2001 in the Spanish tobacco-processing market. Alliance
One lost an earlier challenge against the fine.  A call to Alliance One in Morrisville,  North Carolina ,
wasn’t immediately returned outside business hours.  The case is  C-14/11 , Alliance One International and Others
v Commission, at the European Union Court of Justice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
