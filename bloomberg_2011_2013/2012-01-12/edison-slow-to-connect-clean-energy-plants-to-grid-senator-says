Edison International (EIX) ’s Southern
California Edison has been slower than other California
utilities to connect renewable energy projects to the grid,
according to Senator  Barbara Boxer .  At least 24 renewable energy projects in five National Park
Service areas in southern California are waiting for
interconnection agreements from the utility, many of them for at
least two and a half years, the lawmaker said today in a  letter 
to the utility.  “It is unacceptable that renewable energy projects that
could save taxpayers money have been allowed to sit idle for so
long,” Boxer said.  At least 60 other projects at national parks have been
connected to the grid, including six in California by PG&E
Corp., according to the letter.  “I urge you to review these successful agreements and use
them as a model to finalize pending interconnection agreements
with the federal government so that all parties can fully
realize the benefits of renewable energy,” said Boxer, a
California Democrat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
