Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  plans to
increase its $37.7 million investment in social programs and
review consultants’ recommendations on environmental studies in
a bid to open its stalled $4.8 billion Peruvian gold project,
Vice President Carlos Santa Cruz said.  Newmont, which has invested $800 million in its Minas Conga
deposit to date, has lost $2 million a day on delays since
environmental protests forced the company to suspend the project
in November, Santa Cruz said. Conga seeks to produce up to
680,000 ounces of gold and 235 million pounds of copper annually
by the start of 2015, he said.  “We can improve the project and work with a broader
population to make the benefits felt,”  Santa Cruz  told
reporters in Lima today. “The project is a great opportunity
and mining investment is fundamental.”  Newmont, based in  Greenwood Village , Colorado, is waiting
for the government to hire international consultants to review
the project’s environmental impact study.  The company will invest $37.7 million in roads, schools and
social programs in the Cajamarca region, according to a fact
sheet it provided.  Newmont rose 1 percent to $64.04 at the close in  New York .
The stock has gained 11 percent over the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
