AQT Solar Inc. (0118265D) , a closely held
manufacturer of thin-film solar cells, received $18.7 million
from investors to double production at its headquarters.  The company disclosed the financing today in a filing that
didn’t identify the backers. The funding will help expand its
manufacturing site in Sunnyvale,  California , to a capacity of 30
megawatts a year, Merrill Freund, a spokesman, said today in an
e-mail. Production began there in August 2010.  AQT last year said it would build a new plant in  South
Carolina  to produce 40 megawatts of cells a year by the end of
2011, expanding to 1,000 megawatts by 2015. The company’s plans
for manufacturing outside of California “will be clarified at a
future date,” Freund said today, without elaborating.  The company’s products are made with copper, indium,
gallium, and selenium instead of silicon that’s used in
conventional solar cells. AQT  says  its manufacturing is more
efficient than competitors because it uses equipment used in the
computer hard disk drive industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
