Senator  Rob Portman , an Ohio
Republican, says he’ll endorse former Massachusetts governor
Mitt Romney for president “probably pretty soon” but isn’t
interested in becoming Romney’s vice presidential running mate.  “I’m not interested,” Portman said today on CNBC. “I’m
not seeking it. It’s not going to happen.”  Portman served as director of the Office of Management and
Budget and U.S. trade representative in the George W. Bush
administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
