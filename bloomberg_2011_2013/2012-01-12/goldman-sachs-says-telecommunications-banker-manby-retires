Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said
Charles Manby will retire as global chairman of technology,
media and telecommunications banking.  Manby will become an advisory director to the firm, the New
York-based firm said in a memorandum to employees last month. He
joined Goldman Sachs’s corporate finance unit in London in 1990
before becoming a managing director in 1997 and partner in 2000.
A spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the document today.  He was one of the “core founders” of Goldman Sachs’s
technology practice and advised companies including Deutsche
Telekom AG and  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the firm said in the memo.  Goldman Sachs was the top ranked adviser for technology,
media and telecommunications mergers and acquisitions last year
followed by Bank of America Corp. and  Barclays Capital ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
