Iran ’s increased storage of oil at
sea has yet to indicate the Islamic republic is using tankers 
to stockpile the commodity amid tension with the West, according
to ICAP Shipping International Ltd.  NITC Co., Iran’s tanker company, had nine so-called very
large crude carriers, or VLCCs, shuttling or storing about 18
million barrels of crude at the end of last week, according to
data e-mailed today by ICAP, which tracks storage at sea. That
compares with six on Dec. 23 and is 50 percent fewer than the
year-earlier figure. The number has risen or fallen by at least
20 percent in 15 of the past 20 weeks, ICAP’s data show.  “We would not suggest Iranian storage is on the rise yet
and it may not,” Simon Newman, an oil-shipping analyst at ICAP,
said. “The numbers rise and fall week on week.”  Europe Union officials will meet Jan. 23 to discuss a ban
on crude imports from Iran. The Persian Gulf state has responded
by threatening to halt oil shipments through the  Strait of
Hormuz , a chokepoint for about 20 percent of crude traded
globally.  The data include short-distance shuttle shipments of crude
to a terminal in southern  Egypt  from where the oil can be pumped
via a pipeline to Sidi Kerir on the  Mediterranean Sea . Of the
nine vessels storing or shuttling, two are holding oil long
term. That compares with one on Dec. 23 and nine a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
