Ocado Group Plc (OCDO) , the U.K.’s largest
online-only grocer, said sales increased 16% in the Christmas
season, led by own-label items.  Sales rose to 59 million pounds ($90 million) in the four
weeks ended Dec. 25, the Hatfield, England-based retailer said
in a statement today. That compares with a 16.7 percent increase
in the year ended Nov. 28.  Ocado forecast last month that full-year profit will be
less than analysts’ estimates, hurt by capacity constraints at
its Hatfield distribution center and the employment of extra
staff to boost order fulfillment. The retailer, which is mostly
supplied by grocer  Waitrose Ltd. , also has had to contend with
increased promotions at competitors such as the J Sainsbury Plc
Brand Match campaign and  Tesco Plc (TSCO) ’s Big Price Drop.  “This was encouraging trading for December as a whole and
particularly the seven days to Christmas,” Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Bracey said in the statement.  Ocado rose 1.8 percent to 55.45 pence in  London  yesterday.
The stock has fallen 70 percent in the past year.  Last month, Ocado said earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization were 27.5 million pounds to 28.5
million pounds in the year ended Nov. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
