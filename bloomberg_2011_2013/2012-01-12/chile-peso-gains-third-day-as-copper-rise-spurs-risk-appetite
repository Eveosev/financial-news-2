Chile’s peso rose to the strongest
level in two months as surging copper prices and better-than-
forecast European debt sales bolstered appetite for riskier,
emerging market assets.  The peso gained 1.2 percent to 499.89 per  U.S. dollar  from
506.07 yesterday, the first time the currency has breached the
500 level on a closing basis since Nov. 11.  “Copper has recovered a lot in the last two days, so that
is having an effect on an intraday basis, and the debt auctions
in Spain and Italy were much better than expected,” said
Mauricio Olivares, a trader at the local unit of Bank of  Nova
Scotia . “Traders are also seeing that the central bank will
keep rates unchanged today after higher inflation in December.”  Copper, which accounts for more than half of Chile’s
exports, rose as much as 3.5 percent in  New York  after Spain
sold 10 billion euros of bonds, twice as much as planned, and
 Italy  paid less than half the prior  interest rate  in a sale of
one-year Treasury bills, easing concern that euro-region
governments might struggle to fund their debts.  Chile’s central bank is expected to keep the benchmark
overnight interest rate at 5.25 percent for a seventh straight
month, according to 15 of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Five expect a quarter-point cut. The bank will announce its
decision from 6 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
