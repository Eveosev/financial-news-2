Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.
failed to force the administrators of EMI Group to hand over
documents about the sale of the music group to Citigroup Inc. in
a deal that caused Terra Firma to lose about 1.85 billion pounds
($2.8 billion).  Units of Terra Firma, the private equity firm run by  Guy Hands , sought the valuation documents from EMI’s administrators
at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its advisers because it had
“serious concerns about the circumstances surrounding the
sale,” Judge Nicholas Warren in  London  said in a ruling dated
Jan. 5.  Warren rejected the application, saying Terra Firma had all
the information it needed about the valuation of EMI.  Citigroup seized control of EMI in February after EMI
failed to meet its debt obligations. In 2010, Hands sued
Citigroup in the U.S., saying it had tricked him into buying the
record label.  Terra Firma spokesman  Andrew Dowler  didn’t immediately
return calls to comment. The Financial Times first reported the
ruling earlier this week.  The case is in the Matter of Maltby Investments Ltd.,  High
Court  of Justice Chancery Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
