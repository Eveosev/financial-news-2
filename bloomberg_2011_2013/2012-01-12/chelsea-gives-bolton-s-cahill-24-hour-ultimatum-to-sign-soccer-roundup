stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Cahill Ultimatum  Chelsea has given Bolton’s Gary Cahill 24 hours to decide
whether he wants to join the  London  club for 22 million pounds
($34 million) until 2017, the  Daily Mirror  reported.  Although Chelsea agreed to the deal two weeks ago, Cahill
has yet to give them a final answer.  Zaha to Leave Palace?  Crystal Palace and England youth international Wilfried
Zaha is being followed by both Liverpool and Newcastle, the
 Daily Mirror  reported.  Crystal Palace captain Paddy McCarthy has told the player
he should stay at Selhurst Park.  United’s Gibson to Everton?  Manchester United player  Darron Gibson  may join Everton for
2.5 million pounds, the  Daily Mirror  said.  The Republic of Ireland midfielder has made only two
appearances for United this season, and broken his metatarsal.
The club fined Gibson, alongside team mates  Wayne Rooney  and
 Jonny Evans , after a Boxing Day night out.  Spurs’ Samba Bid  Tottenham Hotspur has offered 7.5 million pounds for
Blackburn defender Chris Samba, the  Daily Mail  reported.  The offer comes two days after Queens Park Rangers bid 7
million pounds for the Congo international. Signing a central
defender in the January transfer window is at the top of Spurs’
manager Harry Redknapp’s wish list, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
