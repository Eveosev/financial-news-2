Deputy Secretary of State  William Burns  met with leaders of Egypt’s  Muslim Brotherhood , the
highest-level contact between the U.S. and the group since the
ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in February.  Burns met with Mohammed Morsi, head of the Muslim
Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party in Cairo, department
spokesman  Victoria Nuland  said yesterday. The meeting took place
as Egypt concludes the final round of elections that Muslim
parties have dominated.  With Islamists set to claim a majority, other Egyptians
have expressed worry about the rights of minorities. Burns and
other U.S. diplomats are also raising those concerns, Nuland
said.  Yesterday’s meeting “was an opportunity to hear from them
and to reinforce our expectation that all the major parties will
support human rights, tolerance, rights of women and will also
uphold  Egypt ’s existing international obligations,” Nuland
said.  Burns is the highest ranking U.S. official to meet with the
Muslim Brotherhood, which won 35.2 percent of the vote in the
third and final round of parliamentary elections, according to
the state-run  Al Ahram  newspaper.  Diplomats from the U.S. embassy in Cairo and other State
Department officials have met with the Muslim Brotherhood in the
past. They have also met with a more conservative coalition of
Salafist Islamic parties, Nuland said.  The Salafists received 27.5 percent backing in this latest
round, Al Ahram said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
