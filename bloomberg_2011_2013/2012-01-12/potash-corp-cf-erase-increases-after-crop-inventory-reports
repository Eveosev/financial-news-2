Fertilizer producers  Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. ,  CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF)  and  Mosaic Co. (MOS) 
declined in  New York  after reports showed higher-than-expected
U.S. corn and soybean inventories.  Potash Corp., the world’s largest fertilizer producer by
market value,  fell  as much as 4.3 percent before closing 35
cents lower at $43.45. CF, the biggest U.S. producer of
nitrogen-based crop nutrients, declined 0.5 percent to $166.29.
Mosaic, the biggest maker of phosphate fertilizer, dropped 0.8
percent to $54.59.  The U.S. Agriculture Department said today that corn
inventories were 9.642 billion bushels on Dec. 1, above the
9.439 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The inventories are down from 10.057 billion a year
earlier, according to the report.  Soybean inventories before this year’s harvest will total
275 million bushels on Aug. 31, up from 230 million projected in
December and the biggest in five years, the USDA said. The
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 232
million bushels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
