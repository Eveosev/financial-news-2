Greece  could need additional funding
under a second international aid package if there isn’t full
participation of private creditors in a debt swap, Deputy
Finance Minister Filippos Sachinidis said.  “If the participation level for example doesn’t reach 100
percent it’s possible that additional support from our partners
will be needed, so as to cover the funding gaps,” Sachinidis
said in an e-mailed transcript of an interview with  Skai radio 
today.  Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  expects to have an outline
of the 100 billion-euro ($128-billion) plan next week, when
talks on the terms of a second financing agreement with European
Union and International Monetary Fund officials start in Athens.
The discussions need to end by March 20, when Greece must make a
14.5 billion-euro bond payment.  Papademos, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos and  Charles Dallara , the managing director of the Washington-based  Institute
of International Finance , had a productive meeting on the swap
in Athens today and will meet again tomorrow, a Greek Finance
Ministry official, who declined to be identified, said.  The talks on the voluntary debt swap “have progressed and
are at a satisfactory point,” Sachinidis said.  The swap is part of a 130 billion-euro second financing
package for Greece agreed by EU leaders in Brussels in October
and aims to lower the country’s debt to 120 percent of gross
domestic product by the end of 2020. The debt is likely to
balloon to almost double the size of the shrinking economy this
year without the writedown, the European Commission estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
