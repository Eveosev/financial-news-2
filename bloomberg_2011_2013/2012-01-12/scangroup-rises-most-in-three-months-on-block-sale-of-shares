Scangroup Ltd. (SCAN) ,  East Africa ’s
biggest marketing and advertising company, gained the most in
almost three months on speculation that investors will continue
to release blocks of shares for sale.  The stock gained as much as 6.7 percent, the most since
Oct. 28, to 39.75 shillings and traded at 37.50 shillings at
1:42 p.m. in Nairobi.  “The stock is largely moving due to expectation on the
market that more blocks of shares will come to the market as the
strategic investors continue to exercise their exit option,”
George Bodo, a research analyst at Nairobi-based ApexAfrica
Capital Ltd., said on phone.  Company directors and employees who had been prevented from
disposing of stock by the capital market authority have started
selling their stakes  after the expiry  of the lock-in period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
