Banks may seize more than 1 million
U.S. homes this year after legal scrutiny of their foreclosure
practices slowed actions against delinquent property owners in
2011,  RealtyTrac Inc.  said.  About 1.89 million properties received notices of default,
auction or repossession last year, down 34 percent from 2010 and
the lowest number since 2007, the Irvine, California-based data
seller said today in a statement. One in 69 U.S. households
received a filing.  While the seizure process has been “highly
dysfunctional,” there were “strong signs in the second half of
2011 that lenders are finally beginning to push through some of
the delayed foreclosures in select local markets,” RealtyTrac
Chief Executive Officer Brandon Moore said in the statement.  The number of  home repossessions  is likely to rise about 25
percent from the more than 804,000 properties seized last year
as lenders resume foreclosure actions,  Daren Blomquist , a
spokesman for RealtyTrac, said in a telephone interview.
Settlement talks are continuing with state attorneys general
over documentation flaws, known as “robo-signing,” that
surfaced in October 2010.  About 400,000 additional homes would have been repossessed
without the slowdown, Blomquist said. The ramp-up in foreclosure
proceedings that began in 2011’s second half is likely to
continue this year, Moore said in the statement.  Foreclosure filings  totaled almost 2.7 million last year as
some properties got multiple notices, RealtyTrac said.  Highest in Nevada  Nevada (STEHNV)  had the nation’s highest rate of foreclosure filings
per household for the fifth straight year, at one in 16, while
total filings were down 31 percent from 2010. A new state law
that took effect in October requires lenders to file an
additional affidavit before starting the foreclosure process.  Arizona had the second highest foreclosure rate, with one
in 24 households receiving a notice, and  California  ranked third
at one in 31. Georgia was fourth, with one in 37, and Utah fifth
at one in 43, according to RealtyTrac.  Michigan ,  Florida ,  Illinois , Colorado and Idaho also ranked
among the states with the 10 highest rates in 2011.  Las Vegas  had the highest rate among metropolitan areas
with populations over 200,000, at one foreclosure filing per 14
households. Stockton, Modesto, Vallejo-Fairfield and Riverside-
San Bernardino, all in California, ranked second through fifth.  Phoenix; Merced, California; Reno, Nevada; Bakersfield,
California; and Sacramento, California, rounded out the top 10,
said RealtyTrac, which sells default data from more than 2,200
counties representing 90 percent of the U.S. population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
