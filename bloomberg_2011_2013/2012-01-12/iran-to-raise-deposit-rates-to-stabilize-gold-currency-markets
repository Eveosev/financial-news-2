Iran’s central bank will increase
the rates lenders pay on deposits, as it seeks to control
volatility in the gold and foreign  currency markets , the
official  Islamic Republic News Agency  reported.  “The council has decided to fix the rates for  bank
deposits  at a rate higher than inflation,” currently 20.6
percent, Kazem Delkhosh, a member of the central bank’s Council
of Money and Credit, was quoted as saying by  IRNA  yesterday. The
decision will be announced to banks next week, he said.  Iranians have been rushing in past weeks to buy gold and
dollars, sending the rial currency plunging, on concern the
government may be unable to maintain economic stability as
international sanctions tighten. The U.S. and European Union are
moving toward an embargo on oil purchases and restricting
dealings with its central bank as they seek to pressure  Iran 
over its nuclear program.  The rial has lost almost 30 percent of its value in less
than three months, according to rates in Tehran’s currency
bazaar, the main unofficial venue for foreign exchange
transactions. Today’s market rate is 16,900 rials per dollar,
while the central bank’s official rate is 11,262 rials.  Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani had made two previous
requests to increase bank deposit rates in the current Iranian
calendar year, which began in March, and both were turned down,
IRNA said.  Rates range from 12.5 percent on one-year deposits to 15
percent for five years, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
