The koruna strengthened, erasing
this month’s loss against the euro, and Czech stocks rallied
after  Spain  and  Hungary  sold more debt than planned, fueling
optimism that the European Union’s debt crisis is easing.  The Czech currency gained as much as 1.4 percent, the most
since Dec. 30, and traded 1.2 percent up at 25.532 per euro by
12:25 p.m. in Prague. The  PX (PX)  equity gauge climbed 1.3 percent,
led by a 5.8 percent rally for Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG. (RBAG)   European stocks and the euro advanced after Spain raised
almost double the amount planned and Italy’s borrowing costs
fell in auctions today. Hungary also exceeded its bond-sale
target as yields dropped on speculation the EU’s most-indebted
eastern member will secure an international aid bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
