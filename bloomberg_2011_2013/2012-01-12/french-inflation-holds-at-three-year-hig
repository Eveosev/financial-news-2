(Corrects to remove reference to taxes in first paragraph.)  France ’s inflation rate held at a
three-year high in December as President Nicolas Sarkozy’s
government cleared increases in gas and electricity prices.  Consumer prices  rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier based
on European Union methodology, matching the rate in November,
national statistics office Insee said today. The November
reading was the highest since October 2008. Economists had
forecast a 2.5 percent increase, according to the median of 12
estimates gathered by Bloomberg.  London crude-oil prices have dropped 29 percent since the
middle of last year, helping ease inflationary pressures on some
products. The increases in natural-gas prices and higher sales
taxes may keep inflation robust through much of 2012.  “Inflation will remain high in France for most of the
year,” said Michel Martinez, an economist at  Societe Generale (GLE) 
in Paris. “With the cost of gas, electricity and public
transport rising, disinflation will take time to appear.”  In the month, prices rose 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
