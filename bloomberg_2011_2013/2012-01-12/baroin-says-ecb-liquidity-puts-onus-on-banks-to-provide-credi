French Finance Minister  Francois
Baroin  said the  European Central Bank ’s three-year liquidity
program means that private lenders have no excuse for not
providing credit.  “ECB liquidity has eased pressure on the banks,” Baroin
told business leaders and local lenders in Besancon, eastern
 France . There is now “excess liquidity,” so “there must not
be a lack of credit for companies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
