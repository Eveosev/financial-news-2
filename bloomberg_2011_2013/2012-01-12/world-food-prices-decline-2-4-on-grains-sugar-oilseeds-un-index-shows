World food prices fell to a 14-month
low in December, led by declines in grains, sugar and oilseeds,
the  United Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organization said.  An  index  of 55 food items fell 2.4 percent to 211 points
from a revised 216.1 points in November, the Rome-based FAO said
on its website today. The month-earlier figure was revised from
215 points, while October was restated at 215.8 points from 216.  Food prices will probably decline this year, Jose Graziano da Silva, who became FAO director general this month, said Jan.
3. Prices have dropped 11 percent since reaching a record in
February, lowering costs that drove global inflation higher and
giving central banks greater scope to ease monetary policy in a
bid to shore up economic growth.  “The trend is down and can continue, it’s a very slow
decline,” said  Abdolreza Abbassian , a senior economist at the
FAO. “Prices are declining but they’re not declining to a low
level, and there are a lot of upside risks.”  The food index dropped year-on-year for the first time
since November 2009. Inflation in  China , the world’s second-
biggest economy after the U.S., declined to a 15-month low in
December, the National Bureau of Statistics reported today.  Soybean futures rose 6.8 percent in  Chicago  in December and
corn climbed 6.3 percent amid concern that dry and hot weather
in Argentina and southern  Brazil  will cut production.  Record Index Average  The index averaged a record 228 points last year, 23
percent more than in 2010 and above the 200 points recorded in
2008, when food riots erupted from  Haiti  to  Egypt . The index
began in 1990.  “If the prices are going to hover around these levels, we
could see some declines but don’t expect a sharp fall, then
really it’s going to be quite expensive to import food,”
Abbassian said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “For
many poorer countries that import both food and oil it’s going
to be a very challenging year indeed.”  The sugar-price index tracked by the FAO slumped to 326.9
points from 339.9 in November, the lowest in seven months.
White, or refined, sugar futures traded in  London  slipped 1.9
percent last month following an 11 percent slump in November.  The index of edible oils and fats dropped to 227.5 points
from 234.8, while the gauge of cereal prices dropped to 217.8
points from 228.8. The meat and dairy indexes were little
changed at 179.3 points and 201.7 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
