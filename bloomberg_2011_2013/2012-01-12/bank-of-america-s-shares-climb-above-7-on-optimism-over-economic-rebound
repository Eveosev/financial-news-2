Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s stock
breached the $7 level, rebounding from last month’s slump, as
investors bet an improving economy will buoy the second-largest
U.S. lender.  The shares rose 15 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $7.02 as of
9:31 a.m. in New York. They traded as low as $4.92 on Dec. 19 on
concern that costs tied to faulty home loans will mount. Bank of
 America, last year’s worst performer in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU) ,  led gainers  in the 30-company benchmark for
2012 as of yesterday with a 24 percent advance.  Quarterly and full-year  results  are scheduled to be
released on Jan. 19 by the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
