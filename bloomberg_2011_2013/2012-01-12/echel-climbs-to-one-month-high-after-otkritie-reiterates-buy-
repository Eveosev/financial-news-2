OAO Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s largest
producer of coal for steelmaking, rose to the highest level in
more than a month in  New York  after Otkritie Financial Corp.
reiterated its “buy” recommendation on the stock.  American depositary receipts  of the Moscow-based miner
added 3.8 percent, settling at $10.05 in New York, the highest
closing price since Dec. 7. The stock, which lost 71 percent
last year, was the best performer on the Bloomberg Russia-U.S.
14 index of Russian companies traded in the U.S.  Moody’s Investors Service cut the outlook for Mechel’s
credit rating to “negative” from “stable” last month after
Chief Financial Officer Stanislav Ploschenko said the company
may renegotiate debt covenants with lenders should the ratio of
net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization exceed 3.5 this year. Moody’s rates Mechel B1, four
steps below investment grade.  “Investors’ concerns over the company’s debt are way too
exaggerated,” Denis Gabrielik, a Moscow-based analyst at
Otkritie, said by phone. “The stock was declining because of
those concerns, while the company has every chance to
refinance.”  Otkritie left Mechel’s 12-month target price for the ADRs
unchanged at $16.60, according to Gabrielik.  Mechel’s net debt climbed 29 percent to  $9 billion  in
September, from the start of 2011, as the company upgraded  steel
mills  and developed the Elga coal field in east Siberia,
according to a Dec. 15 earnings statement. About $2.66 billion
of Mechel debt matures this year, according to the  presentation .  To contact the reporters on this story:
