The euro gained as  European (SXXP)  Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said he saw signs of stabilization
in the region and yields decreased at Spanish and Italian debt
auctions. U.S. stocks rose, erasing early losses. Treasuries
fell as a 30-year bond sale drew lower-than-average demand.  The euro added 0.9 percent to $1.2823 at 4:18 p.m. in New
York and climbed versus 14 of 16 major peers. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.2 percent to 1,295.5 and the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  rose 21.57 points to 12,471.02, five-
month highs for both. Ten-year Treasury yields added two basis
points to 1.93 percent. Oil sank after Bloomberg News reported a
European Union embargo on Iranian imports may be delayed, while
corn and wheat slid on forecasts for larger stockpiles.  The S&P 500 climbed for a fourth straight day, extending
its 2012 gain to 3 percent, as the Spanish and Italian auctions
fueled optimism that  Europe ’s debt crisis was not worsening and
overshadowed data on U.S. jobless claims and retail sales that
disappointed investors. The ECB’s Draghi said that while risks
remain, the economy was showing signs of stabilization as the
central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  at 1 percent.  “Any good news for the  euro zone  could be a trigger for
traders to cover their short positions,” said  Mamoru Arai ,
foreign exchange manager at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New
York. “The market focused on the fairly positive comments about
the European economy from Draghi but I think they were well
balanced. And there was the good auction from Spain.”  Euro Strengthens  The euro rebounded from a 16-month low versus the dollar
and near an 11-year low versus the yen. Spain sold 9.98 billion
euros ($12.7 billion) of notes, compared with a target of as
much as 5 billion euros, while the yield on  Italy ’s one-year
bills fell to 2.735 percent.  Spanish two-year note  yields fell
below 3 percent for the first time since April 2011 and the
extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year bonds
versus benchmark German bunds tightened 37 basis points.  The 17-nation shared currency also climbed after industrial
production in the euro area declined by less than economists
forecast.  “According to some recent survey indicators, there are
tentative signs of stabilization of economic activity at low
levels,” Draghi said at a press conference in  Frankfurt .
“Substantial downside risks to the economic outlook for the
euro area continue to exist in an environment of high
uncertainty.”  Alcoa Inc., Caterpillar Inc. and DuPont Co. climbed more
than 1.6 percent to lead the Dow’s  advance  as commodity
producers and industrial companies had the top gains among the
10 main industries in the  S&P 500 . Financial shares in the S&P
500 rose 0.4 percent collectively, erasing earlier declines. The
 group  of 81 banks, insurers and investment firms has surged
almost 24 percent from a two-year low on Oct. 3 amid increasing
optimism on the economy. The S&P 500 has rallied 18 percent over
the same period.  Earnings Season  JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be the second company in the Dow
to release fourth-quarter results, with the largest  U.S. bank 
scheduled to report before markets open tomorrow. JPMorgan has
beaten analysts’ average estimate for adjusted earnings per
share for 15 straight quarters and 24 of the past 25. Its shares
increased 0.5 percent today.  Earnings season will accelerate next week with reports from
48 companies in the S&P 500 and six Dow members, including Bank
of America Corp.,  Intel Corp . and General Electric Co. Earnings
grew 6 percent in the period, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, which would mark the smallest increase in
more than two years.  Chevron Falls  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  lost 2.6 percent, dragging energy shares to
the biggest decline among 10 groups. Chevron said fourth-quarter
profit was “significantly below” the previous period’s after
maintenance at a California refinery and the sale of a U.K. fuel
plant hurt results.  Stocks fell in early trading after U.S. retail sales rose
0.1 percent in December, less than the 0.3 percent increase
predicted in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Jobless claims
climbed by 24,000 to 399,000 in the week ended Jan. 7, compared
with a median estimate of 375,000 in a Bloomberg survey.  European (SXXP)  financial shares advanced. Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc jumped 5.6 percent as Britain’s biggest government-
owned lender said it will cut 4,800 jobs. ING Groep NV, the
largest Dutch financial-services company, advanced 3.7 percent
after saying it will explore other options for the planned
disposal of its Asian insurance and investment-management
businesses.  European Retailers Plunge  A gauge of European  retailers  had the biggest drop on a
closing basis since October 2008. Tesco Plc plummeted 16
percent, the most since at least 1988, after the U.K.’s largest
supermarket chain reported Christmas sales that missed analyst
estimates and reined back profit expectations. Delhaize Group
SA, the owner of the U.S. Food Lion supermarkets, sank 11
percent in Brussels after also reporting sales that trailed
projections.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 0.7 percent, headed
for the highest close since Dec. 7. Benchmark gauges in Poland,
 Turkey  and Hungary climbed more than 1.4 percent. The BSE India
Sensitive Index fell 0.9 percent as Infosys Ltd. cut its full-
year forecast for sales in dollar terms.  The Hungarian forint jumped 2 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  after the government sold more bonds than planned and
financing costs fell at an auction today.  Spanish Yields  The yield on  Spain ’s  two-year  note dropped for the fourth
straight day, sliding 13 basis points to 2.96 percent. Italy’s
10-year yield sank 35 basis points to 6.63 percent. The yield on
the French 10-year bond dropped 12 basis points to 3.04 percent,
narrowing the difference in yield with bunds by 14 basis points
to 120 basis points.  The yield on the existing 30-year U.S. Treasury bond
increased one basis point to 2.97 percent.  The $13 billion in securities in today’s auction were sold
at a yield of 2.985 percent, compared with the record low of
2.925 percent reached at the December sale and lower than the
average forecast of 2.953 percent in a Bloomberg survey today of
21 primary dealers. The offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.6, versus an average of 2.7 in the
previous 10 auctions.  Oil Reverses  Oil lost 1.8 percent to $99.10 a barrel after climbing 2.1
percent earlier.  An EU embargo on imports of Iranian oil will
likely be delayed for six months to allow countries such as
 Greece , Italy and Spain to find alternative supply, an EU
official with knowledge of the talks said.  Copper jumped 2.9 percent to $3.649 a pound, a 10-week
high, to lead gains among the 24 commodities in the S&P GSCI
index.  China , the biggest buyer of the metal, reported inflation
slowed to a 15-month low in December. Natural gas dropped 2.8
percent to settle at $2.697 per million British thermal units, a
two-year low, following a report showing a below-average decline
in U.S. stockpiles and forecasts for milder weather.  Corn and wheat prices plunged the most in three months and
soybeans slid after the U.S. forecast bigger inventories than
analysts expected, easing concern that shortages will inflate
prices for food and biofuels. Corn tumbled the 40-cent exchange
limit, or 6.1 percent, in  Chicago , soybeans lost 1.7 percent and
wheat slid 5.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
