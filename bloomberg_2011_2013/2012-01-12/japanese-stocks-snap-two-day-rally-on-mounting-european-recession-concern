Japanese  stocks  fell, snapping a
two-day advance, as weaker exports and a shrinking German
economy added to concern the global economy is slowing.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets a third of its revenue
in Europe, fell 0.9 percent after a report  Japan ’s trade surplus
narrowed on a stronger yen and weak overseas demand. Brokerages
led declines after  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  said individual
investors are buying fewer stocks.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction
machinery maker that relies on  China  for 23 percent of its sales,
rose 2.7 percent after slowing mainland inflation raised
expectations the government will take action to encourage growth.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.7 percent to 8,385.59
at the 3 p.m. trading close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix Index
lost 0.9 percent to 727.15 with about four stocks falling for
each that rose.  “ Europe ’s economy probably contracted last quarter and
will keep shrinking this quarter,” said Takeru Ogihara, chief
strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of
Japan’s third-largest bank by market value. “A strong yen is
weighing on Japan’s stocks, especially export-related shares.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.1 percent
today. The gauge rose less than 0.1 percent in  New York 
yesterday after climbing 1.1 percent over the previous two days
on data showing a rise in hiring.  Germany ’s gross domestic product contracted about 0.25
percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months,
the government said yesterday, adding to signs Europe’s largest
economy may be on the brink of recession.  Japan Surplus Shrinks  Exporters slid after the  Finance Ministry  said today that
Japan’s current-account surplus narrowed 86 percent from a year
earlier to 138.5 billion yen ($1.8 billion). The yen traded at
97.77 against the euro today after reaching 97.28 on Jan. 9, its
highest since December 2000. A stronger yen hurts Japanese
manufacturers by eroding overseas profits.  Canon lost 0.9 percent to 3,255 yen.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an
automaker that gets 72 percent of its sales abroad, dropped 2.3
percent to 128 yen.  Securities firms fell after Nomura said total turnover by
individual investors on Japan’s biggest exchanges fell 3.4
percent to 7.6 trillion yen in December from the previous month.  Nomura, Japan’s largest brokerage, fell 3.5 percent to 250
yen.  Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings Inc. (8616)  slid 3.7 percent to 207
yen, while  Okasan Securities Group Inc. (8609)  lost 3.2 percent to 241
yen.  Natural Disasters, Meltdowns  Japanese stocks tumbled last year amid a strengthening yen,
natural disasters and nuclear meltdowns at Tokyo Electric Power
Co.’s Fukushima plant. The Topix dropped 19 percent in 2011, the
biggest yearly decline since 2008, exceeding an 11 percent
decline on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index that tracks companies at
the epicenter of the region’s debt crisis.  Shares on the Topix are  valued  at 0.88 times book value,
near the lowest since March 2009. A number below one means
investors can buy companies for less than the value of their
assets.  “This is a great time to be going out and finding a lot of
cheap companies that will do well over the longer term,” Edwin Merner, president of Tokyo-based Atlantis Investment Research
Corp., told Susan Li today on Bloomberg Television’s “First
Up.” “This isn’t much of a trading market but for
fundamentalists like myself there’s a lot of gold out there,
it’s just a matter of finding it.”  Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , Asian’s biggest apparel chain, was
among 26 companies listed on the Topix set to post earnings
today. After the market closed, Fast Retailing reported a 37
percent increase in net income to 31.1 billion yen in the
quarter ended Nov. 30. The stock fell 0.5 percent to 14,520 yen.  Of 1,584 companies on the gauge that reported last quarter,
191 beat analysts’ estimates and 239 missed expectations,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Exporters to China gained after inflation cooled for the
fifth straight month in December, increasing the odds the
government will unveil more measures to prop up growth.
Consumer prices rose 4.1 percent in December from a year earlier,
the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing today, down
from 4.2 percent the month before.  Komatsu, Japan’s biggest maker of construction equipment,
rose 2.7 percent to 1,902 yen.  Hitachi Construction Machinery
Co. (6305) , which counts China as its biggest market, gained 0.7
percent to 1,321 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
