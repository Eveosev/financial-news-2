The shipping industry is for “long-
term players” because a recovery may fail to occur this year,
accounting firm and insurance adviser Moore Stephens LLP said.  More vessel owners and operators are likely to renegotiate
agreements with financiers or shipyards, Moore Stephens said
today in an e-mailed statement. Finance costs will increase and
the global fleet will expand, according to the adviser.  “Demand for seaborne trade continues,” Julian Wilkinson,
London-based head of the Moore Stephens Shipping Industry Group,
said in the statement. “Many owners, managers and charterers
are reasonably confident of making a major new investment or
development in 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
