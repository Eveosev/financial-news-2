India’s central bank sold the most
foreign currency in 32 months in November, official data show,
as the rupee plunged 7 percent against the dollar.  The  Reserve Bank  of India sold $2.92 billion in November,
according to a report  published  on its website today, the most
since March 2009. Central banks intervene in  currency markets  by
arranging purchases or sales of foreign exchange.  The rupee fell 16 percent last year, the worst performance
in Asia, as Europe’s debt crisis slowed global growth and damped
demand for emerging-market assets. It has rebounded 2.4 percent
in 2012 to 51.81 per dollar as of 2 p.m. in Mumbai, after the
authorities took steps late last year to curb speculation and
volatility in the foreign-exchange market and attract foreign
investment.  The government allowed foreign investors to buy $10 billion
more of rupee-denominated bonds and opened up a part of  India ’s
retail sector to foreign-direct investment. The central bank
tightened rules on trading in the domestic currency-forwards
market, allowed Indian companies easier access to overseas
borrowing, and raised  interest rates  on local bank deposits
owned by Indians living abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
