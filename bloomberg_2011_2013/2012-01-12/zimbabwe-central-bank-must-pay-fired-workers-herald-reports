Zimbabwe ’s central bank must pay
$4.6 million owed to 237 workers it fired in March 2009, a state
labor arbitrator ruled, according to the  Herald .  The arbitrator, named as Mrs E Maganyani, ruled that the
 Reserve Bank  of Zimbabwe must comply with the country’s labor
laws because it isn’t a government department, the state-
controlled, Harare-based newspaper said on its website. The bank
must pay the workers, who were all in non-managerial posts,
within three months, it said.  Zimbabwe abandoned its own currency in February 2009 when
inflation peaked at about 500 billion percent, leaving the
central bank unable to print money fast enough to meet demand.
The country now uses several currencies, mainly the  U.S. dollar 
and the South African rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
