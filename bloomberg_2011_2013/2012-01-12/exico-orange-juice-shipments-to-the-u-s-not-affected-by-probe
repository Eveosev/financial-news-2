Mexico , the worldâ€™s fourth-largest
orange juice producer, is maintaining its exports of the
commodity to the U.S. amid a probe into a fungicide used in
Brazil crops that disrupted shipments from the South American
country, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  The chemical carbendazim, banned by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, is not used on Mexican crops, the ministry said
in an e-mail today from its press department. The FDA has not
notified Mexico of any actions related to Mexican orange
shipments, the ministry said.  The commodity jumped 17 percent in the first two days of
this week amid concern the FDA probe will limit imports from
Brazil, which supplied about 25 percent of the  orange juice 
consumed in the U.S. in 2010. The price is up 5.4 percent in
January, after posting three straight yearly gains.      Orange
juice for March delivery dropped by the 10-cent exchange limit,
or 5.3 percent, to settle at $1.781 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . That brought the two-day plunge to
more than 14 percent, the most since September 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
