U.S. stock futures trimmed gains
after government data showed retail sales trailed projections
and jobless claims increased more than forecast, damping
optimism in the economic outlook.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March were up 0.2 percent at 1,290.3 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York 
after climbing as much as 0.7 percent.  Jobless claims climbed by 24,000 to 399,000 in the week
ended Jan. 7, Labor Department figures showed. The median
forecast of 46 economists in a Bloomberg News survey projected
375,000. Retail sales climbed 0.1 percent in December following
a 0.4 percent advance in November that was more than initially
reported, Commerce Department figures showed. Economists
forecast a 0.3 percent December rise, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Purchases excluding
automobiles fell 0.2 percent.  U.S. futures  followed  European shares higher earlier today
as  Spain  sold 10 billion euros ($13 billion) of bonds, twice the
target for the sale, while Italy sold 12 billion euros of bills,
easing concerns the countries would struggle to finance their
debts. The  European Central Bank  held  interest rates  steady
after two straight cuts as signs of respite from the sovereign
debt crisis gave it scope to pause.   Most (.ADLR)  U.S. stocks advanced yesterday as a rally in banks
helped the market recover from an early slump spurred by growing
signs  Europe  may slip into a recession. The S&P 500 has risen
2.8 percent in 2012 through yesterday as commodity, financial
and industrial companies had the biggest gains among 10 groups.  Earnings Season  JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be the second company in the Dow
to release fourth-quarter results, with the largest U.S. bank
scheduled to report before markets open tomorrow. JPMorgan is
projected to post a record $18.5 billion in 2011 profit when
adjusted for one-time items, a 6 percent increase, according to
a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.  Earnings season will accelerate next week with 48 companies
in the  S&P 500  reporting and six Dow members, including Bank of
America Corp.,  Intel Corp . and General Electric Co.  Forecast earnings growth of 6 percent in the final three
months of 2011 would mark the slowest increase since the third
quarter of 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Analysts predict energy companies will post 21 percent growth to
lead gains, with profits climbing 7.6 percent at industrial
companies and 6.8 percent at technology companies. Raw-material
producers and telephone companies are forecast to show declines
in earnings.  Financial companies are projected to report 3.9 percent
earnings growth, with profits up 21 percent at banks and down
the same amount at diversified financial firms, according to a
compilation of analysts’ estimates. Some analysts are predicting
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will post its lowest annual profit
since the firm went public after its trading business contracted
as investors become more cautious and regulators demand banks
hold more capital and curb proprietary bets.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
