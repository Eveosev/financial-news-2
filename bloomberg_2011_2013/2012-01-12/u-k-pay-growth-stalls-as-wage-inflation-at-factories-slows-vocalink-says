Take-home pay growth at Britain’s
largest publicly traded companies stalled in December as wage
increases in manufacturing slowed, VocaLink Ltd. said.  Incomes after tax and other deductions climbed 2.6 percent
in the last quarter from a year earlier, the same increase as in
the three months through November, the group said in a statement
in  London  today.  Wage growth at manufacturers slowed to 3.6 percent,
according to the report. Pay growth at services companies
accelerated to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent and remained
unchanged at 2 percent in the public sector. The British
Chambers of Commerce said on Jan. 10 that manufacturing export
sales fell to the lowest since 2009 in the fourth quarter.  VocaLink said its data “demonstrate the acute underlying
weaknesses in the labor market, placing ongoing pressure on
wages and salaries.”  The company, which processes 90 percent of British salaries
paid directly to bank accounts, used salary-payment data from
more than 200 members of the FTSE 350 Index and more than 600
government-related organizations for the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
