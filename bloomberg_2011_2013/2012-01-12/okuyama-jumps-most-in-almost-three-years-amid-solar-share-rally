Tokuyama Corp. (4043) , a Japanese maker of
polysilicon,  rose  8.6 percent, the most since February 2009, as
solar stocks surged on optimism for continued demand since the
end of 2011.  Tokuyama gained as much as 14 percent before closing at 264
yen today on the  Tokyo Stock Exchange .  Prices of polysilicon, the main ingredient in solar cells,
rose 3 percent to $27.36 a kilogram last week from the week
before, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, only the
second weekly increase since September.  Yoshiyuki Namiki, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.,
said shares in ingredient makers for solar cells such as
Tokuyama were bought following a rally in related shares in the
European and American markets yesterday.  SUMCO (3436) , a Japanese
manufacturer of silicon wafers, added 3.3 percent to 571 yen at
the close, the highest since Dec. 12.  Tokuyama’s surge may be temporary, Namiki said before the
market close. He said the company’s pricing for polysilicon was
set at $60 a kilogram for 2011, twice as much as the current
market price. “So there is risk of losing profits,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
