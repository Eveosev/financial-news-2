China ’s money-market rate climbed
for the first time in three days as banks hoarded cash to meet
increased customer withdrawals before the weeklong Chinese New
Year holiday, which starts Jan. 23.  The seven-day  repurchase rate  rose even after the central
bank refrained from offering repurchase contracts for a fourth
week, according to traders who are required to participate in
the auctions.  Consumer prices  increased 4.1 percent from a year
earlier in December, the smallest gain since September 2010, the
statistics bureau said today.  “Liquidity is tight and will get tighter before the
holiday,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst at China Merchants
Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “The central bank
will have to either cut reserve-requirement ratios or offer
reverse-repurchase contracts next week.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed 19 basis points to 4.18 percent as
of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, rose three basis
points to 3.08 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.99 percent government bond due June 2021
declined two basis points to 3.40 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
