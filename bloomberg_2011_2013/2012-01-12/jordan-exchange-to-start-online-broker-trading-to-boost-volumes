Jordan’s stock exchange said it
plans to grant licenses this year to allow several brokerages to
start online trading as the market seeks to boost volumes, which
have fallen as regional uprisings deterred investors.  The amount of shares traded on Amman’s benchmark stock
index dropped 57 percent in 2011, Chief Executive Officer Jalil Tarif said in an interview in the Jordanian capital today. The
 Amman Stock Exchange General Index (JOSMGNFF)  tumbled 16 percent last year,
compared with a 20 percent decline in the  MSCI Emerging Markets
Index. (MXEF)  Trading values dropped to 2.9 billion dinars ($4.1
billion) in 2011 compared with 6.7 billion dinars the year
earlier, he said.  “Jordan has been negatively affected by regional
developments, although foreign investments in 2011 in the bourse
have increased,” Tarif said.  Financial markets in the  Middle East  and North Africa
suffered losses last year as regional uprisings that ousted
leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, as well as  Europe ’s debt
crisis, hurt investor sentiment. Jordan’s measure slumped for a
fourth year in 2011. It rose 0.1 to 1,955.33 at close in Amman
today.  “The number of initial public offerings has been low and
was affected by the crisis,” Tarif said.  -- With assistance from Nayla Razzouk and Zahra Hankir in Dubai.
