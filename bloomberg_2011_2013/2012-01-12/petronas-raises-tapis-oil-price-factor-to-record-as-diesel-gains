Petroliam Nasional Bhd. ,  Malaysia ’s
state oil company, increased a price-adjustment factor for its
flagship  Tapis (APCRTAPI)  crude to a record high as profits rise for
refiners making diesel.  Petronas, as the Kuala Lumpur-based company is known, set
the so-called  alpha  at $8.50 a barrel for January, an official
said today, asking not to be identified because of internal
rules. It was $7.50 in December and  averaged  $5.90 in 2011.  Diesel’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude has climbed
7.6 percent this year to $18.63 a barrel, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. This so-called
gasoil  crack spread  averaged $18.61 last year.  Petronas includes the Tapis adjustment factor in its
monthly calculations of official selling prices. The formula is
tied to Brent produced in the  North Sea , a benchmark grade for
 Europe , the Mediterranean and  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
