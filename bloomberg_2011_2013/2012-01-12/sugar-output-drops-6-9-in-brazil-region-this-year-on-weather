Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, fell 6.9 percent
this season through December after frost and drought harmed
crops, industry association Unica said.  Output fell to 31.2 million metric tons from 33.5 million
tons a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Unica said in an e-mailed
statement today. Most harvesting in the region usually takes
place between March and mid-December.  Brazil is the world’s largest producer and exporter of
sugar.  Latin America ’s largest economy produces about 54 percent
of world exports, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture .  Growers in the Center South, where about 90 percent of
Brazil’s sugar and ethanol is produced, reaped 492.2 million
tons of cane in the period, down 11 percent from a year earlier.  Ethanol output slumped 19 percent in the season, to 20.6
billion liters (5.4 billion gallons). Mills turned 48 percent of
the cane into sugar and the rest into fuel. That compares with
45 percent a year earlier.  In December sugar output in the region plunged 59 percent
to 179,000 tons, while cane production decreased 68 percent to
3.65 million tons. The decline partly reflects unusually high
production in December 2010 because of an extension of the
harvest after delays caused by heavy rains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
