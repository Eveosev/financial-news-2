A former employee of the Lebanese
state telecommunications company Ogero was charged yesterday
with spying for  Israel , the  Daily Star  reported, citing
unidentified security sources.  Lebanon has no diplomatic relations with Israel and is
technically at war with its neighbor. Lebanese law prescribes
the death penalty or life imprisonment with hard labor for
convicted spies. Such rulings are subject to appeal to the
highest court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
