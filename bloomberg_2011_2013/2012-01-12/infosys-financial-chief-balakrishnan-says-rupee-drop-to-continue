(Corrects to say Balakrishnan spoke in Bengaluru in second
paragraph.)  V. Balakrishnan, chief financial
officer at  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , India’s second-largest software-
services exporter, comments on the nation’s trade deficit and
the rupee. He spoke in Bengaluru today after the company
reported third-quarter earnings.  The Indian currency declined 7.7 percent against the dollar
in the three months ended Dec. 31, the worst performance among
11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It has rebounded 2.4
percent this month to 51.81 per dollar.  India has “a continuing trade deficit. Any currency which
runs a sustained trade deficit for a long time, it tends to
depreciate over a longer period of time. That is a reality.
Second, India is seen as an emerging-market risk. So, to that
extent, money is not coming in.  ‘‘Third,  India ’s political system is paralyzed. No reforms
are happening. So India is not seen as a growth story. So if you
put all this together, the currency has to depreciate.’’  The government has taken some steps to increase investment
opportunities, such as opening up the retail industry, ‘‘so some
money will come. I think it will balance out.  ‘‘We’ve taken rupee at 52 for the next quarter, but I think
as long as the country runs a sustained trade deficit, you will
see the currency depreciating over a longer period of time.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
