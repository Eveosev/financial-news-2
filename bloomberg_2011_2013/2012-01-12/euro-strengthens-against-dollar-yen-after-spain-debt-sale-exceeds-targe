The euro reached a one-week high
versus the dollar after European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said policy makers have averted a credit shortage and
Spain sold almost twice its maximum target at a note auction.  The franc climbed against most of 16 major peers amid bets
the Swiss National Bank may moderate its resolve to stem the
currency’s gains. Canada’s dollar erased an advance after data
showed U.S. retail sales increased less than forecast, while
 Brazil ’s real reached the strongest level in more than a month
after that nation’s retail sales beat projections.  “Any good news for the  euro zone  could be a trigger for
traders to cover their short positions,” said  Mamoru Arai ,
foreign-exchange manager at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New
York. Short positions are bets a currency will fall. “The
market focused on the fairly positive comments about the
European economy from Draghi, but I think they were well
balanced. And there was the good auction from Spain.”  The euro climbed 0.8 percent to $1.2814 at 5 p.m. in New
York. It reached $1.2845, the highest since Jan. 5, after
falling to $1.2662 yesterday, the lowest since September 2010.
The 17-nation currency rose 0.7 percent to 98.36 yen after
gaining as much as 0.9 percent earlier. The dollar slipped 0.1
percent to 76.76 yen and touched 76.67 yen, the lowest level
since Jan. 5.  Challenge to SNB  Investors are using the uncertainty created by the
resignation of  Swiss National Bank  President Philipp Hildebrand
as an opportunity to challenge the bank’s currency floor of 1.20
francs per euro, according to a UBS AG client note.  The SNB imposed the limitation on Sept. 6 to halt the
currency’s advance as Europe’s debt crisis fueled demand for the
relative safety of Swiss assets, putting pressure on the
country’s exporters  The franc traded 0.2 percent higher at 1.2104 per euro and
rallied 1 percent to 94.46 centimes per dollar.  Canada’s dollar was little changed at C$1.0191 to the
greenback after rallying earlier as much as 0.6 percent.
American retail sales rose 0.1 percent last month, data showed,
falling short of a 0.3 percent gain forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. The U.S. is  Canada ’s largest trading partner.  A separate report showed more Americans than forecast filed
first-time claims for  unemployment benefits  last week.  Real Climbs  Brazil’s real advanced 1.3 percent to 1.7796 per dollar
after the nation’s retail sales increased 1.3 percent in
November from a month earlier. That surpassed the 0.4 percent
projection and spurred speculation the central bank can’t cut
 interest rates  by too much without inflation. The real touched
1.7761, its strongest since Dec. 5.  The euro rose 0.6 percent today against nine developed-
nation counterparts, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes. The dollar sank 0.3 percent, and the yen fell
0.2 percent.  Switzerland ’s franc was the best performer with a
gain of 0.8 percent.  Draghi said at a press conference in  Frankfurt  the record
489 billion euros ($628 billion) in three-year ECB loans to
banks last month are beginning to unlock markets and have
prevented a “serious” credit contraction.  “Tentative signs” show the euro-area economy is
stabilizing even as its sovereign-debt crisis poses risks to the
outlook, the ECB president said. Policy makers left their
benchmark rate at 1 percent today, in line with the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Better Shape’  “There are signals that the funding market is getting in
better shape, which is good for the euro short-term,” said
Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in  New York . “The fundamentals, though, have not
changed and are still negative.”  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 0.8
percentage points below the euro interbank offered rate today,
the least expensive since Aug. 31. It was negative 0.9
percentage points yesterday after increasing to negative 1.58 on
Nov. 29, the most expensive since 2008.  The pound weakened versus the euro on speculation the  Bank
of England  will increase its bond-buying program this year. The
bank’s Monetary Policy Committee held its key interest rate at
0.5 percent, in line with the forecast of all 53 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Policy makers kept their bond-buying target at
275 billion pounds ($421 billion).  “We expect the Bank of England to expand its quantitative-
easing program, possibly next month, to support the economy,”
said  Ian Stannard , head of European currency strategy at Morgan
Stanley in  London .  Sterling depreciated 0.8 percent to 83.58 pence per euro.
The currency was little changed at $1.5333 after touching
$1.5279, the weakest level since Oct. 6.  Spanish, Italian Sales  Spain  auctioned 9.98 billion euros ($12.8 billion) of notes
today, more than the maximum target of 5 billion euros set for
the auction. It issued 4.27 billion euros of new benchmark
three-year debt at an average yield of 3.384 percent, down from
5.187 percent at the previous offering on Dec. 1.  Italy sold 12 billion euros of bills at 2.735 percent, down
from 5.952 percent at the last auction. The government plans to
sell debt tomorrow due in 2014 and 2018.  ----With assistance from  David Goodman , Anchalee Worrachate and
