Belgian public enterprise minister
Paul Magnette said the European Commission “has no democratic
legitimacy” to tell countries how to conduct economic policy,
De Morgen reported, citing an  interview .  Magnette said Belgium should remain free to choose how it
reduces its budget deficit to below the European Union limit of
3 percent of gross domestic product, according to the newspaper.
The European Commission was “going too far” with strict
economic policies and criticism of European countries’ budgets,
De Morgen cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
