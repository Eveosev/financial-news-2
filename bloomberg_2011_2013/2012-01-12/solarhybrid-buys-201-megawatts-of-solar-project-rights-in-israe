Solarhybrid AG (SHL) , a German renewable-
energy developer, bought rights to solar-energy projects in
 Israel  with a combined capacity of about 201 megawatts.  Solarhybrid agreed to a one-time payment of 9 million
shekels ($2.3 million) and a so-called earn-out payment of 240
shekels per realized kilowatt, the Brilon-based company said
today in a statement.  The solar developer bought the rights from the estate of
insolvent Sunday Energy Ltd., according to the statement. Other
companies, including Israeli construction contractor Ormat
Systems Ltd., own on average 22 percent of the projects,
Solarhybrid said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
