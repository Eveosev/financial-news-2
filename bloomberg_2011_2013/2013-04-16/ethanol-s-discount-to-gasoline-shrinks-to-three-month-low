Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed to the lowest level in three months on record low
seasonal inventories of the biofuel and as the value of
Renewable Identification Numbers gained.  The spread, or price difference, between the fuels
tightened by 0.88 cent to 37.78 cents a gallon, the least since
Jan. 15. The Energy Information Administration reported
 stockpiles  of the fuel in the week ended April 5 were 18 percent
lower than a year earlier and inventories along the U.S. East
Coast were 32 percent below this time last year.  “It still feels a little bit tight,” said Jim Damask, a
manager at StarFuels Inc., in Jupiter,  Florida . “It’s still
trading relatively stronger than it has in the past.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery  climbed 3.3 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.404 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 9.8 percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery gained 2.42 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.7818 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S., with one
bushel of the grain distilling into at least 2.75 gallons of the
renewable fuel.  Under a 2007 energy law the U.S. is required to use 13.8
billion gallons of ethanol this year and 14.4 billion in 2014.
Compliance with the mandate is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs, certificates that are assigned
to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported that can be
submitted to the government or traded.  RINs Values  Corn-ethanol based RINs  climbed 1.4 percent today to 71
cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which
cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, jumped 11
percent to 86 cents, the highest level in a week.  The biofuel will consume about 42 percent of this year’s
corn crop, the Agriculture Department projected in its April 10
World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report.  Corn for May delivery gained 16.5 cents, or 2.6 percent, to
$6.6325 a bushel in  Chicago .  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
1 cent a gallon, down from 2 cents yesterday. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Ethanol Production  Ethanol  output  averaged 854,000 barrels a day in the week
ended April 5, the highest level since June 29, the report from
the Energy Department’s analytical arm showed.  The department is set to release the latest figures
tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Ethanol-blended gasoline has made up an average of 90
percent of the total U.S. gasoline supply so far this year,
little changed from the same period a year earlier, EIA data
show, and touched a record 96 percent as of April 5.  U.S. companies didn’t make any foreign purchases of the
fuel that week. Imports have averaged 27,000 barrels a day so
far this year, up from 4,000 a year earlier, according to EIA
data.  Brazil, where sugarcane is used to make ethanol, is the
biggest supplier of ethanol to the U.S.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  fetched $2.46 a gallon as of last
week, data compiled by Bloomberg show, the highest since April
13.  U.S. Exports  The U.S.  exported  1.5 million barrels of ethanol in
January, the most recent month for which data is available,
according to EIA. That’s the highest since June.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast was
unchanged at $2.74 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In
New York the additive increased 1 cent to $2.545, while in the
U.S. Gulf the biofuel dropped 4 cents to $2.455 and in Chicago
ethanol slipped 3.5 cents to $2.395 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf widened 4
cents to 28.5 cents, the largest differential since Oct. 24,
2011, while Chicago’s discount to  New York  expanded 4.5 cents to
15 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
