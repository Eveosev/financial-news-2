China  is expected in the first half
to establish the minimum requirements solar-component makers
must meet in order to be exempt from stricter government
control, the China Securities Journal reported.  The move is part of an effort to accelerate consolidation
in the industry by weeding out weaker companies, the Journal
said, citing people it didn’t identify. The requirements will
provide benchmarks to evaluate various strengths and weaknesses
of companies in the solar industry, according to the report.  China will set environmental protection standards by
capping the amount of electricity consumed and waste liquid and
gas emissions during production processes, the newspaper said.
Investment in research and development must account for 4
percent of revenues for companies with sales of 50 million  yuan 
($8 million) to 200 million yuan and 6 percent for those with
sales below 50 million yuan, the Securities Journal said.  Companies will be required to attain certain production
capacity levels, the report said. Those that don’t meet the
rules will face stricter policy control on bank loans, land
approvals and environmental evaluation, the Journal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
