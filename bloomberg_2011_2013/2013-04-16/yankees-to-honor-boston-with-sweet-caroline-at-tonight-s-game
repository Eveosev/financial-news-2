The  New York Yankees  will play
“Sweet Caroline” at the end of the third inning during
tonight’s game against the Arizona Diamondbacks to show support
for Boston, the Yankees said on Twitter.  The team also will have a moment of silence at Yankee
Stadium to honor the victims of the bombing at the Boston
Marathon yesterday. Three people died and more than 175 people
were injured in two explosions at the finish line.  The  Boston Red Sox , the Yankees’ biggest rival,
traditionally play the Neil Diamond hit at each home game, and
fans at Fenway Park sing along.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
