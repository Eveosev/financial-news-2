Serbia’s public debt fell in the
first three months of 2013 even as the value of liabilities
expanded, the Debt Management Agency said.  Public debt, which comprises the government’s direct and
indirect liabilities both in the country and abroad, dropped to
57.7 percent of gross domestic product at the end of March from
59.3 percent at the end of 2012, according to a  report  published
today on the agency’s website.  Total public debt stood at 19.4 billion euros ($25.
billion) at the end of March, an increase of 9.7 percent since
December, the data showed. The agency calculates the debt ratio
based on the expected GDP for the year.  The government sees the economy growing 2 percent in 2013
after a 1.7 percent contraction last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
