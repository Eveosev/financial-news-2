Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  agreed to
work with Reignwood Group to develop a plant that will generate
power using differences in sea temperature off the coast of
southern  China .   The 10-megawatt facility will be designed by Lockheed
Martin and will be the largest so-called ocean thermal energy
conversion project to date, Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed
said today in a statement. It will supply all the power needed
for a green resort being built by Reignwood.  To contact the reporter on this story:
