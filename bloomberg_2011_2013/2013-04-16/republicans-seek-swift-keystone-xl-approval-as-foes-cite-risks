House Republicans and oil-industry
groups pushed for swift U.S. approval of  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s
proposed Keystone XL pipeline, while foes at a congressional
hearing said the project poses a risk to the environment.  “If the president refuses to act on this project, which is
clearly in the best interests of the United States, and which
will bring tremendous benefits to our country, Congress must act
and must do so quickly,” Representative Doug Lamborn of
Colorado, chairman of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee
on Energy and  Mineral Resources , said today at a hearing in
Washington on a bill that would approve the pipeline.  Representative Rush Holt of  New Jersey , the top Democrat on
the panel, said the $5.3 billion project will yield relatively
few jobs once complete and expose the U.S. to the potential of a
spill. “That sounds like a bad deal to me,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
