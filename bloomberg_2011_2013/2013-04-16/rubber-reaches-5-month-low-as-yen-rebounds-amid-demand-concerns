Rubber plunged to a five-month low
as the yen rebounded against the dollar and concerns grew that
the global recovery may stall, sapping investor appetite for the
yen-denominated futures for the commodity used in tires.  The contract for delivery in September lost as much as 4.6
percent to 247 yen a kilogram ($2,544 a metric ton), the lowest
level for a most-active future since Nov. 15. Futures traded at
252.3 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:33 a.m.,
extending this year’s losses to 17 percent.  Japan ’s currency rebounded to 95.80 per dollar and global
stocks extended selloffs, boosting investor demand for the
haven. Oil in New York fell to a four-month low, cutting the
appeal of natural rubber as an alternative to synthetic
products. Concerns grew that a slowdown in economic growth of
 China  will weaken demand from the world’s biggest consumer for
commodities from rubber to copper, said Takaki Shigemoto,
analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  “A rapid expansion in China’s economy is over, leading to
slower growth in raw-material demand,” he said today by phone.  Rubber stockpiles at Qingdao, China’s largest hub for the
commodity, rose to a record 366,900 tons by April 15, the
Qingdao International Rubber Exchange Market said yesterday.  China’s 7.7 percent increase in first-quarter gross
domestic product from a year earlier marked the first time in
data going back two decades that four periods in a row have seen
growth of less than 8 percent.  In  Shanghai , the contract for September delivery lost 3.4
percent to 19,660  yuan  ($3,178) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
