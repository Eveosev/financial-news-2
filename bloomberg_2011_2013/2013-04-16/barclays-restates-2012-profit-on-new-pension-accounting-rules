Barclays Plc (BARC)  restated its profit
for 2012 to include the effect of accounting rules on pensions
and special-purpose entities that came into force at the start
of this year.  Pretax profit in 2012 would have been 7.6 billion pounds
($11.7 billion) under those rules compared with the 7.05 billion
pounds it originally published, the London-based bank said in a
statement today. The bank’s core Tier 1 capital ratio was
restated as 10.8 percent from 10.9 percent previously.  The IFRS 10 rule, which came into effect on Jan. 1,
requires the lender to include profit from some entities that
hadn’t been previously consolidated into the parent. Under IAS
19, the bank has to recognize in full any actuarial gains or
losses from its so-called defined benefit pension plan, it said.  Britain’s second-largest bank by assets provided the
figures as a comparison for when it reports earnings under the
new rules on April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
