Rwanda  said it plans to raise $400 million in a debut sale of Eurobonds as the East African country seeks to accelerate economic growth.  The government appointed BNP Paribas SA and Citigroup Inc. as lead managers for the 10-year bond offering, Finance Minister Claver Gatete said in mobile-phone  text messages  today. The banks will arrange investor meetings in  Asia ,  Europe  and the U.S. starting Thursday, central bank Governor John Rwangombwa said in comments posted on Twitter.  “There will be strong interest” from investors that don’t track benchmark emerging-market indexes,  Stuart Culverhouse , chief economist at investment bank Exotix Ltd., said by phone from  London . It “will give them a bit of a yield pick up,” he said.  Less than 20 years after a genocide that killed about 800,000 Rwandans, President  Paul Kagame  is boosting transport links and energy supplies and promoting regional trade to lift the land-locked tea- and coffee-growing nation into a middle- income economy by 2020. Rwanda’s economy will expand by 8 percent this year, Kagame said in an interview last month, from 7.4 percent in 2011. That’s almost double the 4.2 percent forecast by the  International Monetary Fund  for neighboring Burundi and  Uganda .  Privatization Push  Rwanda will use $200 million to repay loans on the Kigali Convention Centre and a development plan for  RwandAir (0118669D) , the national carrier, according to a copy of the prospectus obtained by  Bloomberg News . Another $150 million will be spent completing the center and $50 million on a hydropower plant, according to the prospectus.  The government is also planning to sell stakes in 13 state- owned companies focusing on agriculture, services, transport, banking and insurance industries by the end of the fiscal year of 2014 to 2015, raising about 10 billion Rwandan francs ($15.7 million), according to the prospectus.  Rwanda is rated B with a stable outlook by both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, five levels below investment grade at both companies. The nation’s inflation rate may accelerate to 7.5 percent by the end of the year, IMF said in a statement today, after easing to 3.25 percent last month from 4.79 percent in February, according to Rwanda’s statistics agency.  Kagame, who has been president since 2000, said last month in an interview in Miami that the government was planning to sell about 350 million euros ($457 million) in debt before the end of the fiscal year.  Bigger Offering  With Rwanda’s rating the bonds may be priced to yield 7 percent to 8 percent, said Exotix’s Culverhouse. Zambia, which is rated one level higher at B+ by S&P and Fitch, yields 5.4 percent on its $750 million of dollar bonds due September 2022, which it sold in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s a shame it’s not a benchmark size,” Culverhouse said, referring to the $500 million cut-off needed to include the bonds in emerging market indexes compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. “Obviously they’d be paying more for a slightly bigger issue, but maybe the incremental cost of going from $400 million to $500 million would be offset if it was in the benchmark.”  Rwanda is joining other East African countries looking to sell their first Eurobonds this year.  Kenya , the region’s largest economy, plans a sovereign bond by September, raising as much as $1 billion, Finance Minister Robinson Githae said last month. Tanzania,  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy, in February enlisted Citigroup to help prepare for a  credit rating  before issuing a maiden Eurobond by year-end.
