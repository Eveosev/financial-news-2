Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) , the Swiss drugmaker
that gets almost all its sales from a treatment for a rare  lung
disease , reported first-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates and said it may raise its full-year forecast.  Operating income jumped to 124 million Swiss francs ($133
million) from 67.1 million francs a year earlier, Allschwil,
Switzerland-based Actelion said in a statement today. Analysts
forecast operating income of 92 million francs, the average of
nine  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The results show the company is keeping a promise to
investors to maximize profitability while it develops new
treatments such as Opsumit, a successor to the Tracleer
treatment that accounts for 87 percent of sales and starts to
lose patent protection in 2016. The company forecast in February
that 2013 “core” profit excluding currency shifts will be at
the same level as last year, with single-digit growth in 2014
and double-digit growth by 2015.  “We will carefully look at guidance for the full year as
it is possible that some of the forecasted profit growth for
2014 could be brought forward into this year,” Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Oakley said in the statement.  Actelion shares have climbed 62 percent in the past year,
including reinvested dividends, compared with a 31 percent
advance in the benchmark Swiss Market Index.  The company said it expects to complete an 800 million-
franc share buyback this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
