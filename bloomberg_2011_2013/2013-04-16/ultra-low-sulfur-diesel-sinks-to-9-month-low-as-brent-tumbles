Ultra-low sulfur diesel slid to a
nine-month low as Brent crude and gasoil slipped amid declining
fuel demand in  Europe .  Futures fell 1 percent as Brent crude dropped below $100 a
barrel for the first time since July. Gasoil weakened in Europe,
indicating less need for distillate exports from the U.S.
European oil demand will slide by 340,000 barrels a day this
year, the International Energy Agency forecast April 11.  “The issue with gasoil, and generally European products,
is that European domestic demand has weakened and there are more
exports coming from the U.S.,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil
market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company in
 London . “Refineries are also coming out of maintenance and
winter weather is ending.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery declined 2.94
cents to $2.7998 a gallon at 9:47 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange on volume that was 7.7 percent below the
100-day average. Prices touched $2.7712, the lowest intraday
level since July 13.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus May West Texas Intermediate
crude narrowed 48 cents to $29.64 a barrel.  Gasoil in Europe for May delivery on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange fell 0.7 percent to $841 a metric ton. Brent for June
settlement fell $1.08 to $99.55 a barrel.  Gasoline for May delivery sank 2.01 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.7375 a gallon on volume that was 20 percent above the 100-
day average. Prices touched $2.7036, the lowest intraday level
in three months.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.4 cent to
$3.522 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
fallen 26.4 cents from the year-to-date high of $3.786 on Feb.
26 and are 38.5 cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
