Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., the largest investor in  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , jumped the most
since January in New York trading on gains in the value of its
stake in the soft-drink maker.  Berkshire Class A shares rallied $4,000, or 2.6 percent, to
$161,000, a record closing price. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola surged
5.7 percent after posting  first-quarter profit  that beat
analysts’ estimates and announcing a deal to sell some bottling
distribution rights in North America.  Buffett’s firm has  400 million  Coca-Cola shares, making it
one of the four  largest holdings  at Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire, along with investments in Wells Fargo & Co., American
Express Co., and International Business Machines Corp.
Berkshire’s stakes in the companies may increase in the future
as the firms buy back shares, Buffett said in a  letter  to
investors last month.  “The four companies possess marvelous businesses and are
run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-
oriented,” Buffett said in the letter. “Too much of good thing
can be wonderful.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
