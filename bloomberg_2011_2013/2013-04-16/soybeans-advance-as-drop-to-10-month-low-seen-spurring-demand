Soybeans gained on speculation that
a slump to the lowest price in almost 10 months will spur buying.  The oilseed for delivery in July gained as much as 0.8
percent to $13.6725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and
was at $13.66 by 2:49 p.m. in  Singapore .  Futures earlier dropped to $13.505 a bushel, the lowest
level since June 19, on concern that a bird-flu outbreak in
 China , the world’s largest buyer, will reduce animal-feed use.
Imports by China will probably decline in the year beginning Oct.
1, ending an eight-year surge, according to a Bloomberg survey
published yesterday.  “There has been fresh buying at these levels,” said
Ambika T.B., an oilseed analyst at Karvy Commodities Ltd. in
Hyderabad,  India .  Corn for July delivery was little changed at $6.275 a
bushel, while wheat gained 0.5 percent to $7.0275 a bushel.  About 2 percent of the corn crop was sown as of April 14 in
the 18 major producing states that planted 92 percent of last
year’s acreage, the USDA said in a report yesterday. That’s
behind last year’s 16 percent and an average of 7 percent in the
previous five years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
