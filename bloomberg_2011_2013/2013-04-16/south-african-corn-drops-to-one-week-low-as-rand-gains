South African white-corn futures
declined to the lowest level in almost a week as the rand
rebounded from the biggest one-day drop in six months against
the dollar, making locally produced grain cheaper.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
fell 0.2 percent to 2,125 rand ($232) a metric ton, the lowest
level since April 10, by the close on the Johannesburg-based
South African Futures Exchange. The yellow variety increased 0.1
percent to 2,101 rand a ton.  “The difference in the performance of white and yellow
corn was due to speculative buying mainly driven by rand
volatility,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG Pty Ltd., said by
phone from  Pretoria  today.  South Africa ’s currency strengthened as much as 0.9 percent
to 9.1236 per dollar. The rand’s three-month implied volatility
against the dollar rose to 12.75 percent, from 12.62 yesterday,
the most among 16 major currencies today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Wheat for delivery in May fell less than 0.1 percent to
3,398 rand a ton.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
