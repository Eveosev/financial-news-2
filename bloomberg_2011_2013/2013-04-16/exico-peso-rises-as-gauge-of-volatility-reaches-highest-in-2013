Mexico ’s peso rose as a gauge of
volatility increased to this year’s high amid bets in favor of
the Latin American’s nation currency.  The currency appreciated 0.9 percent to 12.1772 per dollar
at 9:25 a.m. in Mexico City, the biggest gain on a closing basis
since April 5. The rally followed a 1.7 percent plunge
yesterday. Three-month historical volatility increased to its
highest since Dec. 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s a lot of money in Mexico so it moves in and out
very quickly,”  Pedro Tuesta , the chief economist at 4Cast Inc.,
said in a telephone interview from  Washington .  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the peso compared with
those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- was 142,542 on April
9, compared with the all-time high of 151,665 reached in
January, according to the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  The peso rallied the most today among major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg as the U.S. Commerce Department reported
that housing starts climbed to the highest level since June
2008. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to its
northern neighbor.  Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB reiterated today in a research
note to clients that it was bullish on the peso.  Mexico’s currency commission, which includes officials from
the  Finance Ministry  and the central bank, said on April 8 that
the central bank would no longer auction $400 million of its
reserves daily. The measure was put in place in November 2011 to
curb volatility as the peso headed for a decline of 11 percent
that year.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.78 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.15
centavo to 146.63 centavos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
