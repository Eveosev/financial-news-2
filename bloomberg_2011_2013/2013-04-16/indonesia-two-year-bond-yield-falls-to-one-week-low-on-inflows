Indonesia ’s two-year government
bond yield fell to the lowest in more than a week on foreign
inflows amid a slide in global stock and commodities markets.  Overseas investors pumped 990 billion rupiah ($102 million)
into sovereign debt in the two days through yesterday, finance
ministry data show. The MSCI World Index of shares slumped the
most since June yesterday and commodities sank to a nine-month
low after data showed Chinese growth slowed in the first quarter.
 Bank Indonesia  kept its  reference rate  at 5.75 percent for a
14th month last week and its next meeting is on May 14. Finance
Minister  Agus Martowardojo  is set to take over as central bank
governor when  Darmin Nasution ’s term ends May 23.  The yield on the 11 percent bonds due October 2014 dropped
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.39 percent as
of 2:28 p.m. in Jakarta, the lowest since April 4, data from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show. That compares with a yield
of 2.46 percent for similar-maturity Philippine notes and 2.83
percent for Thai securities.  “Investors are still seeking better yields,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, Jakarta-based head of treasury research at PT Bank
Negara Indonesia. “There is room for bonds to rally until the
next central bank meetings, when we might see a change in
monetary policy after the new governor steps in.”  The finance ministry plans to raise 1.5 trillion rupiah by
selling Islamic debt with maturities of between six months and
24 years at an auction today, according to a  statement  on its
website.  The rupiah declined 0.1 percent to 9,725 per dollar, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It traded at a 0.3
percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which
fell 0.1 percent to 9,750, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,725 by the Association of Banks in  Singapore  from 9,714
yesterday. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped one
basis point to 5.94 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
