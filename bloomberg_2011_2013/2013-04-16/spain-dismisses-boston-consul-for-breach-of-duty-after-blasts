Spain dismissed its consul in
 Boston  for failing to give proper assistance to Spaniards caught
up in the bombing at the city’s marathon that left three dead.  Pablo Sanchez-Teran  was removed from his post for failing
in his duty to provide consular assistance, said a spokesman for
Spain’s foreign affairs ministry in Madrid in a phone interview.
El Mundo newspaper reported that he decided to close the
consular office in Boston two hours after the attack on the
marathon in which 91 Spaniards had registered to run.  “The  consular service  is to provide assistance to
Spaniards and after a tragedy such as this, such assistance is
infinitely more necessary,” Foreign Affairs Minister Jose
Manuel Garcia Margallo told reporters in  Madrid  after being
asked why the consul had been dismissed. “When every television
station in the world is saying that there has been an attack, to
shut the consulate after saying it was time to do so is simply
inadmissible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
