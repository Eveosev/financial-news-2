President  Charles Evans  said he is “optimistic” about U.S.
growth in 2013 and next year, while cautioning that the economy
still needs record monetary stimulus.  “I don’t think we should be complacent” about the
economic outlook, Evans said today in a speech in Chicago.
“Unemployment is unacceptably high.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said in March it will
keep buying $85 billion in bonds each month until the labor
market substantially improves. Evans, who votes on the FOMC this
year, told reporters after the speech that he expects the Fed to
keep the asset-purchase plan in place until at least late this
year.  “I would not be surprised if we end up doing this until
late 2013, ultimately ending the program in 2014 at some
point,” he said.  The Chicago Fed chief said that while the value of the  U.S.
dollar  fluctuates according to many economic factors, the
currency has “surprised” people who expected it to depreciate
more.  “It’s actually really quite strong, compared to other
countries that are struggling a lot,” he said. “Any safe haven
flows to the U.S. necessarily means the dollar appreciates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
