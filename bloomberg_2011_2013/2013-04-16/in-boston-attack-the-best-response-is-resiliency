Ten years ago, a Palestinian
suicide bomber detonated himself at a cafe in the German Colony
neighborhood of  Jerusalem . Seven people were killed, including
David Applebaum, an American-born emergency-room doctor who had
treated countless victims of previous attacks. Applebaum was
visiting the cafe, called Cafe Hillel, that evening with his
daughter Nava, who was to be married the next day. Nava was also
killed.  The next day, I went to Cafe Hillel to report on the
aftermath. To my surprise, it was open for business. There was
still debris on the street, but the blood had been washed away,
the glass had been swept up and coffee was being served.  Served, I should say, to a large group of customers. No one
was scared. People were drinking cappuccino and reading
newspaper accounts of the attack. The residents of Jerusalem
weren’t going to change their routines simply because terrorists
were bent on killing them.  This is a roundabout way of saying the following: It’s
important that those runners who couldn’t finish the  Boston 
Marathon yesterday -- when two bombs went off, killing three and
injuring more than 140 -- be allowed to finish. It’s important
for the marathon to open registration right away for next year’s
race. It’s important for those businesses shut by this attack to
reopen as soon as possible. And it’s important for people to
patronize those businesses.  Whoever committed this attack should be caught and
punished, but  law enforcement  won’t solve the larger problem. We
can mitigate the impact of terrorism, but, at a certain point,
the money we spend, the rights we curtail and the freedom of
movement we limit will provide no returns. There is no
satisfactory solution to the problem of mass anonymous violence.  As a result, resilience becomes the paramount response.
Keeping your wits about you as individuals, as a government and
as a culture is what counts.  The Boston Globe  published the following  this morning: “The
attack truncated the world’s most prestigious road race, which
draws runners from across the globe, and will forever mar what
is annually the city’s most uplifting day: Marathon Monday.”  The Globe has been magnificent in its coverage of the
attack, but this thought is wrong. The race will only be marred
if its organizers -- and Boston’s police and civic leaders --
allow themselves to let this event alter the way they stage the
race. Next year’s Boston Marathon can be a triumph. But as the
people of Jerusalem (and  New York  and  London  and many other
cities) have learned, merely carrying out daily
responsibilities, and refusing to yield to panic, becomes a
triumph all its own.  ( Jeffrey Goldberg  is a Bloomberg View columnist. The
