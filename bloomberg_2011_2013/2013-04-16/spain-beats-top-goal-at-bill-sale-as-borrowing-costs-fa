Spain  beat its maximum target at a
bill auction in Madrid today while borrowing costs fell as the
government presses the European Union to ease its budget-deficit
targets.  The Spanish Treasury sold 5.07 billion euros ($6.6 billion)
of debt, compared with a maximum target of 5 billion euros, the
Bank of Spain said. The government sold 1.19 billion euros of
six-month notes to yield 0.530 percent and 3.88 billion euros of
12-month paper yielding 1.235 percent. Six-month borrowing costs
fell from 0.794 percent on March 12 while 12-month borrowing
costs declined from 1.363 percent.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is trying to sustain
the momentum of European Union reforms that will underpin the
country’s finances in the face of objections from northern
members of the currency union. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  and his Dutch counterpart Jeroen Dijsselbloem this
month told their euro-region colleagues the bloc will have to
approve changes to its treaties before they can pool
responsibility for bailing out banks.  Spain’s 2012 budget deficit rose to 10.2 percent, the most
in three years, after the government had to shoulder the burden
of rescuing its banking system single-handed. Economy Minister
Luis de Guindos is pushing for a relaxation of this year’s
target of 4.5 percent after overshooting the limit last year.  Demand for Spanish paper rose at today’s auction with the
bid-to-cover ratio on the six-month paper at 3.77 compared with
3.22 in March while demand for the 12-month notes was 2.04
compared with 1.85.  To contact the reporters on this story:
