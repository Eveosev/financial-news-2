Crude options volatility slipped
from a three-month high as futures stabilized after dropping as
much as 9.1 percent in four days of declines.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 25.09 percent at 1 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , down from 25.75 percent yesterday.  Puts protecting against a 10 percent drop in futures were
trading at 31.9 percent volatility, compared with 24 percent for
calls betting on a 10 percent rise in prices. The so-called put
skew, where puts are more expensive than calls, was 3.7 percent
April 10.  “People didn’t expect this move to come down so hard and
they’re scrambling,” said Jim Colburn, a vice president and
energy options broker at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York .
“Short-covering of puts is driving the vol.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery fell 62
cents to $88.41 a barrel at 12:34 p.m. on the Nymex. The May
contract slipped 34 cents to $88.37 a barrel, and touched
$86.06. Prices have declined from $94.64 April 10. In that same
period, volatility has risen from 19 percent.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $85 puts, which sank 11 cents to 7 cents a barrel on volume
of 4,850 contracts at 1:30 p.m. June $70 puts were the second-
most active, holding steady at 9 cents on volume of 4,588 lots.  More Puts  Puts accounted for 61 percent of electronic trading volume
today. Bearish bets made up 73 percent of yesterday’s volume of
345,578 contracts.  May $85 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 42,819 contracts changing hands. They
rose 14 cents to 18 cents a barrel. May $83 puts increased 5
cents to 7 cents a barrel on 26,500 lots. May options will
expire tomorrow.  “You had a whole bunch of puts in May that were given up
for dead,” Colburn said. “It was a gamma rush, when the market
is moving and the option you think is gone comes back to life.
The question is where is the bottom?”  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
36,308 contracts. Next were June $80 puts with 35,778 and June
$85 puts with 35,063.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
