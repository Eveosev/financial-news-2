Nigeria ’s naira retreated, heading
for its lowest level in two weeks, as importers in  Africa ’s
biggest oil producer were said to increase demand for dollars.  The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy
declined 0.2 percent to 158.25 per dollar by 11:31 a.m. in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, set for its weakest close
since April 2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
naira has fallen 1.3 percent this year.  Nigeria relies on imports to cover 70 percent of its own
fuel needs because of inadequate refining capacity, and those
shipments into the country are a source of pressure on the
naira, according to the  Central Bank of Nigeria .  “Increased dollar demand to cover import bills and other
foreign-exchange obligations” is pressuring the naira,
“despite CBN’s aggressive liquidity-management efforts,”
Ecobank Transnational Inc. strategists, led by Paris-based Paul- Harry Aithnard, wrote in a note to clients today.  Borrowing costs on the nation’s local-currency debt due
January 2022 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
11.01 percent, according to yesterday’s prices on the Lagos-
based  Financial Markets Dealers Association  website.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 were little changed at 3.986 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi slid 0.1 percent to 1.9455 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
