Arcadia, the energy trader owned by
billionaire  John Fredriksen , is shutting its offices in Dubai
and Switzerland, said three people with knowledge of the plans.  Some staff from the Swiss office in Nyon will be relocated
to London and Singapore, according to the people, who asked not
to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the
media. Arcadia has appointed Paul Adams as chief executive
officer, replacing Peter Bosworth, the people said.  Reuters 
reported Bosworth’s departure on March 28. Nobody responded to
four phone calls and three e-mails to Arcadia’s London office or
three calls to officials in Singapore.  Arcadia also has offices in London, Brisbane, Cyprus and
Rancho  Santa Fe , California, according to its  website . The group
trades and markets crude and oil products.  Arcadia was bought by Farahead Holdings Ltd. in 2006 from
 Japan ’s Mitsui & Co., according to the company’s website.
Farahead is indirectly controlled by trusts set up by
Fredriksen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
