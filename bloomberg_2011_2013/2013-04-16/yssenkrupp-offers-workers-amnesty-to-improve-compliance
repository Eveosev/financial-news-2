ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ,  Germany ’s largest
steelmaker, will introduce a temporary amnesty for some workers
to spur them to disclose any breaches of antitrust or corruption
laws and internal rules after recent violations at the company.  The program lasting to June 15 follows “serious compliance
violations in recent times which have caused huge damage to the
group’s image” and exempts workers from punishment if they
cooperate, the Essen-based company said today in a statement.  The amnesty won’t apply to management board members of the
group and individual business areas, nor the heads of operating
units and group companies. “For legal reasons,” a separate
solution will apply to employees of units in the U.S.  ThyssenKrupp last year ousted three board members to help
repair a boardroom tainted by corruption allegations. An
antitrust watchdog raided the company’s offices in Duisburg in
February. That added to the company’s involvement in an elevator
cartel and a suit for damages by Germany’s state-owned railway
operator over alleged fixing of prices for rails by ThyssenKrupp
and two peers.  “The question is whether this will provide additional
information,” Hans-Peter Wodniok, an analyst at Fairesearch
GmbH & Co KG, said by phone from Kronberg near  Frankfurt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
