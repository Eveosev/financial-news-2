Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) , the most profitable U.S. banks, are selling a
combined $3.5 billion of debt and preferred stock after
generating record income in the first quarter.  Wells Fargo issued $1.15 billion of five-year debt that
pays 63 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered  rate  and an additional $850 million of its 1.5 percent
securities due January 2018 that yield 75 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  JPMorgan is planning to issue $1.5 billion of perpetual
preferred stock to yield 5.15 percent, according to a person
familiar with that transaction who asked not to be identified,
citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  Wells Fargo’s 2018 securities traded at 100.5 cents on the
dollar April 11 to yield 1.4 percent, or 67 basis points more
than Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The offerings follow first-quarter earnings that relied on
cost cuts and smaller loan-loss reserves with lending less
lucrative. JPMorgan’s net income rose 33 percent to $6.53
billion and Wells Fargo’s profit climbed 22 percent to $5.17
billion.  Relative borrowing costs have been declining, with the
extra yield investors demand to own bank debt instead of
industrial company obligations narrowing to 8 basis points
yesterday, from 103 a year ago, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
