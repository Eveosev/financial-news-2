Botswana and  Namibia  will sign an
agreement for a $11 billion transnational railway on April 20,
clearing the way for tendering for the project, Botswana’s
Transport and Communications Minister Nonofo Molefhi said.  “Bids for potential financing will be opened as soon as we
have signed the agreement,” Molefhi said at a coal conference
today in Botswana’s capital, Gaborone. The agreement will cover
all aspects including legal matters, he said.  Southern African countries are investing to expand their
railways to meet growing global demand for coal, led by  China .
Known as the Trans-Kalahari Railway, the 1,500-kilometer (932-
mile) line will run from landlocked Botswana’s coalfields in the
south and east to the Namibian port of Walvis Bay in the west.  The project, to be financed by private business, will be
implemented and overseen by a company jointly controlled by the
two governments, Molefhi said. The governments will also be
responsible for the acquisition of land for the railway.  To contact the reporter on this story:
