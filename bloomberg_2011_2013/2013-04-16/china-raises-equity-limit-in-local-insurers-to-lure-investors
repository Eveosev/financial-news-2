China  will allow shareholders in
the country’s insurers to own stakes as big as 51 percent,
increasing the limit to attract strategic investors and boost
the industry’s capital strength.  The combined holdings of a single investor and its
affiliated parties can exceed 20 percent if it meets
requirements including total assets of at least 10 billion  yuan 
($1.6 billion), the China Insurance regulatory Commission said
in a  statement  today on its website.  “Appropriately” loosening equity holdings in Chinese
insurers can help companies attract strategic investors, enhance
shareholder responsibilities and improve the efficiency of their
corporate governance, the regulator said in a separate
statement. The limit seeks to prevent any negative effect from
over-concentration of equity stakes, according to the statement.  To increase its holding to more than 20 percent, the
investor also needs to have been a shareholder in the insurer
for at least three years, and its total long-term equity
investments can’t exceed its net assets, the regulator said. The
investor will be barred from selling the shares for three years
after increasing its stake, according to the new rules.  A 2010 regulation had said qualified investors could be
exempted from the current 20 percent cap if approved by the
regulator, without specifying criteria or giving a new ceiling.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
