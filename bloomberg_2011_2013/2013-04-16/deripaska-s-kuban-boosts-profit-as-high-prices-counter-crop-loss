Billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s grain
company Kuban Agricultural Holding boosted profit in 2012 after
record wheat prices in  Russia  compensated for crop losses.  Net income rose to 656 million rubles ($20.9 million) from
469 million rubles a year earlier, said Andrey Oleynik, managing
director of agribusiness at Deripaska’s Basic Element holding
company, which controls Kuban. The wheat crop dropped about 30
percent to 117,700 metric tons.  Drought seared a quarter of the grain crop across Russia
last year, pushing wheat prices to more than 12,000 rubles a
ton. Kuban’s weighted average sales price was 8,700 rubles a ton
in 2012, helping to raise its net income margin to 12.2 percent
from 8.6 percent, Oleynik said today in an interview in Moscow.  “We sold all the grain and other crops on the domestic
market because prices were so high that there was no sense in
organizing exports on our own,” Oleynik said.  Kuban, which operates about 84,000 hectares (207,564 acres)
in the southern Krasnodar region, had a smaller barley crop,
reaping 16,300 tons compared with 33,300 tons in 2011. Its
sugar-beet harvest fell to 392,600 tons from 400,600 tons.  Corn rose to 48,100 tons from 46,800 tons, while soybeans
climbed to 25,700 tons from 23,500 tons and sunflower seeds
expanded to 22,400 tons from 19,700 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
