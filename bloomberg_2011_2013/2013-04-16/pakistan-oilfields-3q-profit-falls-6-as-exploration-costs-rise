Pakistan Oilfields Ltd. (POL) , the
nation’s third-biggest energy explorer, said profit last quarter
fell 6 percent after more than doubling spending on exploration.  Net income dropped to 2.96 billion rupees ($30.1 million),
or 12.52 rupees a share, in the three months ended March 31 from
3.16 billion rupees, or 13.36 rupees a share, a year earlier,
the Rawalpindi-based company said today in a filing. Sales rose
less than 3 percent to 8.2 billion rupees.  The company allocated 390 million rupees on exploration,
150 percent more than the same quarter last year, which “sent
costs flying,” said Asir Zaffar, an analyst with Optimus
Capital Management Pvt. in Karachi. “Sales did manage a
flattish growth, but the high exploration cost offset that
growth.”  Pakistan Oilfields fell as much as 1.1 percent to 467
rupees, the lowest in 11 days, at 9:37 a.m. local time in
Karachi trading. The shares have advanced 7 percent this year,
compared with a 9.2 percent gain in the benchmark KSE100 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
