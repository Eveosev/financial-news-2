Grosvenor Group Ltd., the property
company owned by the Duke of Westminster’s family trusts, said
earnings before items rose to a record after central  London  real
estate values increased.  Pretax profit excluding changes in investment property
values and one-time items climbed to 87.4 million pounds ($134
million), the highest since the London-based company began
reporting the measure of earnings in 1999. That compares with
80.8 million pounds a year earlier, Grosvenor said today in an
e-mailed statement.  Property prices in London’s West End, where the Grosvenor
estate includes 300 acres (121 hectares) in the Mayfair and
Belgravia neighborhoods, have gained as tenants compete for a
limited amount of office and retail space. Grosvenor’s Britain
and Ireland profits rose by 132 percent to 38.1 million pounds,
according to the statement.  “This is another year of strong performance from Grosvenor
with our London portfolio again contributing significantly,”
Chief Executive Officer Mark Preston said in the statement.
“Our confidence in the future of the cities in which we are
active around the world is reflected in a further rise in the
value of our international development pipeline, from 3 billion
pounds to 3.4 billion pounds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
