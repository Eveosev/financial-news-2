Vietnam ’s dong declined the most in
seven weeks on speculation the widening gap between domestic and
international gold prices will boost unofficial trade in the
precious metal, increasing demand for dollars. Bonds gained.  Gold fell 9.1 percent yesterday, the biggest drop since
1983, and has lost 28 percent since reaching a record high in
September 2011. The disparity between local and world prices has
widened to as much as 6 million dong ($287) per tael, Tuoi Tre
newspaper reported today. A tael is about 1.2 ounces.  “When world gold prices dropped sharply, the gap with
local prices grew bigger,” said Nguyen Ngoc Duy, a foreign-
currency trader at Military Commercial Joint-Stock Bank. “That
may cause smuggling of gold and would bolster dollar demand.”  The dong fell 0.3 percent to 20,925 per dollar as of 3:30
p.m. in Hanoi, the biggest drop since Feb. 26, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate 
at 20,828, unchanged since December 2011, its website showed.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the official rate.  The yield on the five-year bonds declined two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.55 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
