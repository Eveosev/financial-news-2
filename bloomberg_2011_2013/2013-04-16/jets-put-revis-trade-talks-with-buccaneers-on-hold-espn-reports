The New York Jets have put trade
talks with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers regarding All-Pro cornerback
 Darrelle Revis  on hold,  ESPN said , citing unidentified people
familiar with the situation.  Revis underwent tests yesterday that showed he’s ahead of
schedule in his rehabilitation from a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee, ESPN said. The Jets plan to examine
Revis before continuing to explore a trade ahead of the April
25-27 National Football League draft, according to ESPN.  Revis, 27, has been cleared to run without restrictions
after playing in two games last season before tearing his ACL.
He’s been seeking a contract worth $16 million annually and Jets
owner  Woody Johnson  said last month that the team would listen
to trade offers, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
