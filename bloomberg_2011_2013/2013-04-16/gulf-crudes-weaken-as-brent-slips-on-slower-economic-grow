Gulf of Mexico  crudes on the  spot
market  weakened as the European benchmark they compete with
slipped below $100 for the first time since July.  Brent’s premium to West Texas Intermediate shrank by 40
cents to $11.28 a barrel at 1:20 p.m. in  New York . Brent has
fallen 16 percent since Feb. 8 as refinery maintenance and weak
refining margins in the Atlantic basin have damped demand,
Miswin Mahesh, a London-based oil analyst at  Barclays Plc (BARC) , said
in a research note.  “The trigger for the move below $100/bbl, however, came
from a packed tide of cross-currents from selloffs in other
asset classes, along with the recent stream of poor
macroeconomic data from the U.S. and  China ,” Mahesh said.  Light Louisiana Sweet, the benchmark light, sweet crude on
the  Gulf Coast , weakened by 50 cents to a premium of $14 a
barrel over WTI in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at 12:31 p.m., according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium
also fell by 50 cents, to $14.20.  Mars Blend, a medium, sour Gulf crude, fell 65 cents to a
premium of $8.15 a barrel versus WTI. Crude from the Poseidon
formation narrowed its premium by 80 cents to $7.80 a barrel.  Oil from the Southern Green Canyon play weakened by 50
cents to $7 a barrel more than WTI, and Thunder Horse crude
weakened by $1.15 to a premium of $10.85.  Gulf crudes compete with foreign oils that are priced
against Brent for space in U.S. refineries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
