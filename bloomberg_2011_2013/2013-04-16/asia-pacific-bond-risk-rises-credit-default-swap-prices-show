The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index increased 3.5 basis points to
93.5 basis points as of 9:48 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Deutsche Bank AG prices. The benchmark is set for its biggest
one-day rise since March 27, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan advanced 2 basis points to 117 as of
8:18 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The gauge is set for its highest close since April 10,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
115.5 basis points as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The measure is poised to close at
its highest level since April 8, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
