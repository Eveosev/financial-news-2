Colombia ’s peso rose for the first
time in five days on speculation measures announced by the
government won’t be enough to ease gains in the currency.  The peso appreciated as much as 0.3 percent to 1,829.70 per
 U.S. dollar  before trading little changed at 9:37 a.m. in
Bogota. The currency, which strengthened 9.7 percent in 2012,
has dropped 3.5 percent this year.  Colombia yesterday said it will adjust rules on risk and
profitability governing pension funds in a bid to weaken the
peso by encouraging them to invest more abroad. The changes are
part of the stimulus plan Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  had
said at the beginning of this month that the government would
announce that included currency measures.  “Hopes were high and it was hard to deliver after so much
speculation on what currency measures would be taken,” said
 Camilo Perez , the head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the
country’s second-biggest bank.  Yields on Colombia’s peso bonds maturing in 2024 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5 percent, according
to the stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
