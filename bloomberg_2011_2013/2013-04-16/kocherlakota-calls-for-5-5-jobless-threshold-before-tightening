Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis
President  Narayana Kocherlakota  said the Fed should do more to
spur economic growth by reducing the threshold for consideration
of a policy tightening to a 5.5 percent unemployment rate.  “My outlook for the next two years can be summarized as
being an ongoing modest recovery,” with unemployment staying at
7 percent or more through late 2014, Kocherlakota said today in
a speech in Minneapolis similar comments he made April 2. “This
level of unemployment will continue to constrain wage growth.
Consequently, inflation pressures will remain subdued.”  The slow recovery calls for “more accommodation,” the
Minneapolis Fed president said in a speech, repeating his call
to postpone consideration of any increase in interest rates. He
does not vote on policy this year.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  in March reiterated its
plan to buy $85 billion in bonds every month until the labor
market outlook improves “substantially.” It also pledged to
keep interest rates near zero as long as unemployment is above
6.5 percent and inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.  Fed Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said today in a speech she
favors holding the benchmark  interest rate  “lower for longer,”
while  New York  Fed President William C. Dudley said a slowdown
in the pace of employment growth in March highlights the need to
maintain the pace of bond purchases.  To contact the reporters on this story:
