The forint weakened for the first
time in five days on speculation Hungary’s efforts to curb its
 budget deficit  won’t be enough to alleviate the European Union’s
concerns.  The currency slid after Economy Minister  Mihaly Varga  said
the gap can remain below the EU’s prescribed limit of 3 percent
of gross domestic product without additional tightening. Hungary
will probably exit the EU’s so-called excessive deficit
procedure for the first time since joining the bloc in 2004 as
the deficit target is expected to be met for a third year in a
row, Varga said.  “The forint had a slight negative reaction” to Varga’s
comments, Andrej Taraczky, Budapest-based head of  currency
trading  at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., said by phone. “Most
likely the government will need to make further policy
adjustments sooner or later.”  The forint depreciated 0.3 percent to 295.38 per euro by
12:27 p.m. in Budapest. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-
year bonds were little changed at 5.61 percent.  Hungary  will collect less revenue than expected from a tax
on financial transactions and will use some of its budget
reserves to maintain the deficit at 2.7 percent of GDP, Varga
said.  The forint also weakened as data showed German investor
confidence declined more than economists forecast in April,
Taraczky said.  The European Commission has criticized Hungary’s measures
to cut the budget shortfall, including extraordinary taxes on
selected industries, as unsustainable. The commission has
projected a 3.4 percent of GDP deficit for this year and next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
