Spain and  Italy  lost a challenge at
the European Union’s highest court against the EU’s decision to
push ahead without them to create the bloc’s first common patent
system.  The EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled today that
given it was “impossible” for all of the EU’s 27 nations “to
agree on a common system for the whole EU within a reasonable
period,” it was lawful to move ahead without the two dissenting
nations, who had objected to the plan largely over language
concerns.  The remaining 25 EU nations agreed two years ago to move
forward with a common patent system under a mechanism called
enhanced cooperation whereby member states can work together as
long as at least nine agree on the move.  The EU has 23 official languages and numerous compromises
failed to satisfy political demands or risked increasing
translation costs for companies.  The EU court today said the decision didn’t damage the EU
and “does not prejudice any competence, right or obligation”
of Spain and Italy, who are free to join the agreed system.  EU ministers in February formally approved plans to set up
the first patent court, paving the way for the common patent
system after a decades-long deadlock on the plans.  The cases are: C-274/11, Spain v. Council, C-295/11, Italy
v. Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
