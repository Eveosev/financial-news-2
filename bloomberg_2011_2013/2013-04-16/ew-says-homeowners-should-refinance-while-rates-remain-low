Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said U.S. homeowners should take advantage of low  interest rates 
to refinance their mortgages because “this is a time-limited
opportunity.”  “We’re not going to be in a world of 3 1/2 to 4 percent
mortgages forever,” Lew said in testimony to the Senate Budget
Committee today about President  Barack Obama ’s 2014 budget
proposal. “As many families as can should refinance.”  The  Federal Reserve  has been buying $85 billion of bonds
each month since the start of the year -- $45 billion in
Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage debt -- in an effort to
hold down borrowing costs and encourage economic growth. It has
kept its benchmark interest-rate target for overnight lending
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to
support the economy.  Lew also urged lawmakers to agree on a budget plan and show
that “we’re not going to either have gridlock or kicking the
can down the road.” An agreement will “probably have a very
substantial, beneficial effect in terms of decision to invest
and hire.”  Lew, who took office as  Treasury secretary  Feb. 28, was
testifying for the second time today and in the last of four
hearings to defend the administration’s budget plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
