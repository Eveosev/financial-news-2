Treasury 10-year notes fell for the
first time in four days as investors sought higher-yielding
assets amid a recovery in gold and equities, damping the refuge
appeal of government debt.  Benchmark yields  climbed from the lowest level since
December amid bets the 17-basis-point decline this month through
yesterday was excessive. Treasury  volatility  fell to the lowest
since December yesterday. The securities remained lower after
new-home construction in the U.S. jumped more than forecast in
March and the cost of living declined. Federal Reserve Board
Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said she favors holding the benchmark
 interest rate  “lower for longer.”  “We’re being driven by external markets, notably what’s
going on in equities,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond
strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“It’s created a reluctance to buy the Treasury market in a bit
of a risk-on move.”  The U.S. 10-year yield rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 5 p.m. in New York after
falling to 1.67 percent yesterday, the lowest level since Dec.
12. The 2 percent note due February 2023 dropped 3/8, or $3.75
per $1,000 face amount, to 102 1/2, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices.  The 10-year  yield  traded below its 200-day moving average
of 1.74 percent for a third straight day. Moving averages are
indicators of momentum.  Treasury volatility as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch  MOVE index  was 51.93 basis points as of 4:17 p.m.
in New York, the lowest level since Dec. 11. The gauge, which
tracks the outlook for swings in U.S. government-debt rates, has
averaged 63.8 basis points in the past year.  Fed Voices  The Fed’s Yellen cautioned that some bond-market investors
may be paying too much for higher yields. The central bank’s
low-rate policies are intended “to promote a return to prudent
risk-taking” in credit markets, she said today in remarks
prepared for an International Monetary Fund discussion panel on
monetary policy. “Obviously, risk-taking can go too far.”  The central bank has left its funds  target rate  at zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008.  Fed Bank of  Chicago  President  Charles Evans  said in a
speech in Chicago he is “optimistic” about U.S. growth in 2013
and next year, adding that the economy still needs record
monetary stimulus.  Inflation ‘Subdued’  “I would not be surprised if we end up doing this until
late 2013, ultimately ending the program in 2014,” he said,
referring to the Fed’s program of purchasing $85 billion in
 government securities  each month.  Fed Bank of New York President William C. Dudley said the
risk was low that inflation could exceed the central bank’s 2
percent target. “Underlying measures of inflation are
subdued,” Dudley said today in prepared remarks for a speech in
 Staten Island , New York.  Gold for immediate delivery jumped 1.5 percent to $1,367.89
an ounce after tumbling 9.1 percent yesterday, the biggest
decline since 1983. The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  gained 1.4
percent after a 2.3 percent plunge yesterday, the most since
Nov. 7.  “We rallied on the fear trade yesterday and there was no
follow through,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in
New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “We’re chopping
around at the top end of the range.”  Resistance is at 1.67-to-1.7 percent, where sell orders may
be clustered, while the support of buy orders is at 1.8 to 1.82
percent, Roth said.  TIPS Returns  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
inflation expectations known as the break-even rate, shrank to
as little as 2.40 percentage points today, the narrowest since
Nov. 29.  The consumer-price index dropped 0.2 percent after a 0.7
percent jump in February, the Labor Department said today in
 Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for
no change. The core measure, which excludes volatile food and
energy costs, rose 0.1 percent, less than forecast.  The Fed’s five-year, five-year forward break-even  rate ,
fell to 2.69 percent last week, the lowest since before the
central bank said in December it would buy $45 billion of
Treasuries a month on top of the $40 billion of mortgages it was
already purchasing.  “The most significant long-term indicator has been the
drop down in CPI -- on the margin, it makes Treasuries a little
more attractive,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist
at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.  TIPS have returned 0.4 percent this year through yesterday
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes. Conventional
Treasuries returned 0.7 percent.  Housing starts  climbed 7 percent to a 1.04 million annual
rate, following a revised 968,000 annual rate in February,
Commerce Department figures showed. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey called for 930,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
