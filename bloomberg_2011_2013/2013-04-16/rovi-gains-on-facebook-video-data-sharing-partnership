Rovi Corp. (ROVI)  rose to its highest
price in 10 months after  Facebook Inc. (FB)  chose its entertainment
database to give users greater access to information on movies,
TV shows and celebrities.  Rovi, a provider of digital home-entertainment products
based in Santa Clara, California, climbed 4.5 percent to $21.96
at the close in New York, its highest since June 12.  The largest networking website will use Rovi Video,
containing information on more than 4 million TV shows, movies
and sporting events, to help its users include links to that
data on their Facebook page, the companies said in a statement
today. The venture will also give Facebook application
developers access to the data for use in their products.  “We see the social interaction with movies, TV shows and
video entertainment growing immensely over the next couple of
years,” Facebook said in the statement.  Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, has been working
to keep users on its site longer by adding social links to
entertainment content. Last month,  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the online
video service, began offering its U.S. subscribers the ability
to link their Facebook account to show friends’ activities, with
the option to post films or shows to the social network and
comment on them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
