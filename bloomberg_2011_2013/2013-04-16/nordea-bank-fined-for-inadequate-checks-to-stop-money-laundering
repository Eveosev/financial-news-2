Nordea Bank AB (NDA) , the Nordic region’s
largest lender, was fined 30 million kronor ($4.7 million) by
Sweden’s financial watchdog for failing to comply with
requirements designed to prevent  money laundering .  Nordea, based in  Stockholm , received a remark and an
administrative fine for being “deficient in its internal
governance and control with regard to the European Union
sanctions regulations,” the Financial Supervisory Authority
said today in a  statement  on its website.  The regulator said Nordea “did not screen beneficial
owners against the EU sanctions regulations for several years”
and that it “has exposed itself to the risk of giving
blacklisted individuals access to funds and economic resources
without the bank’s knowledge.” Nordea failed to disclose all
its transactions in frozen accounts, notifying the watchdog in
only 16 of 74 such cases, the watchdog said.  The regulator also criticized Nordea for being “deficient
in its  risk assessment ” relating to a customer from Gibraltar
it didn’t identify.  In a separate statement today, Nordea said the fine, which
will be paid by its Swedish unit, was “high” given that no
prohibited transactions had taken place in the frozen accounts
mentioned. The bank said it has taken measures to reduce the
risks listed in the FSA’s remark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
