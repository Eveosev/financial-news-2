Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR) , the Abu
Dhabi developer merging with its biggest rival, won a government
contract to build 996 villas, Chairman Ali Eid Al Mheiri said.  The homes will be completed in two years, Al Mheiri told
reporters in the United Arab Emirates capital today. The company
also agreed to lease out an office tower at the World Trade
Center Abu Dhabi to Arabtec Holding PJSC, the U.A.E’s biggest
construction company.  Aldar plans to complete its merger with  Sorouh Real Estate
Co. (SOROUH)  in June to create the Middle East’s third-largest developer.
The companies are benefiting from government efforts to
commission new developments and restart others that have been
stalled since the financial crisis.  Aldar has sold 125 homes at its Al Raha Beach project in
the emirate, the chairman said. The developer plans to focus on
completing Yas Island, which already includes seven hotels, a
water park and the Ferrari World amusement park that was bought
from Aldar by the government in 2011, Al Mheiri said. Prices at
Al Raha Beach may rise 2 percent to 2.5 percent by the end of
the year, he said.  “There is always a lag between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, so
when we see improvement in Dubai, we feel confident” he said.
Prices have stabilized and are likely to increase in the next
six to 12 months, Al Mheiri said.  Arabtec’s plan to lease the 59-story Offices at World Trade
Center tower will help the company’s expansion into oil and gas,
power and infrastructure, the developer said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
