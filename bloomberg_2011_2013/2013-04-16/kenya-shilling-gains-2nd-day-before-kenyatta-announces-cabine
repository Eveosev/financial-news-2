Kenya ’s shilling advanced for a
second day against the dollar on subdued demand for the U.S.
currency before President Uhuru Kenyatta forms his government
this week.  The currency of the region’s biggest economy appreciated
0.2 percent to 83.77 per dollar by 10:10 a.m., the strongest
level since Aug. 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  President Kenyatta, 51, is this week expected to form a
government and fill all cabinet positions that fell vacant after
his inauguration on April 9. Kenyatta is a former deputy premier
and finance minister.  Demand for dollars is low “because a lot of people had
covered their positions in the event of political disturbances
and now everyone is waiting to see how low it goes before they
begin buying,” Julius Kiriinya, a dealer at Nairobi-based
African Banking Corp., said today in a phone interview.  Uganda’s currency strengthened 0.1 percent to 2,522 per
dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling gained 0.5 percent to 1,617
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
