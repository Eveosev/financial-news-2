Beppe Grillo, the ex-comic with a
blocking minority in  Italy ’s Senate, offered to restart alliance
talks with Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani in a bid
to gain support for the presidential candidacy of journalist
Milena Gabanelli.  Grillo asked Bersani to vote for Gabanelli, who won the
nomination of the ex-comic’s Five Star Movement today, when
parliament meets April 18 to select a successor to President
Giorgio Napolitano. The offer comes after Five Star stymied
Bersani’s attempt this month to become prime minister.  “Try it, try voting for her and we’ll start from there,”
Grillo said in a video broadcast today on his blog. “Think
about it Bersani, think about it. And it could be the beginning
of who knows, who knows, a collaboration.”  Grillo, 64, won a quarter of the vote in a February general
election and has since shunned cooperation with leaders of
competing parties. Bersani, head of the biggest parliamentary
force, lacks a majority in the Senate and needs backing from
either Grillo or Berlusconi to form a government.  The president, whose job is largely ceremonial, serves a
seven-year term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
