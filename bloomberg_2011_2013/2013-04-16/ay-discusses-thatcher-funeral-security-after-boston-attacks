U.K. Home Secretary Theresa May met
with security services and the Metropolitan Police today after
the attack on the Boston marathon, her department said.  May updated Cabinet colleagues when they met this morning,
while British political leaders said tomorrow’s funeral for
former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Sunday’s  London 
marathon will go ahead as planned. More than 4,000 officers will
be on duty during the funeral, London’s police force said.  “We are absolutely confident that we can keep the event
safe and secure,” Sports Minister Hugh Robertson said of the
marathon in an interview with BBC Radio 4 today. “The best way
to show solidarity with Boston is to continue and send a very
clear message to those responsible that we won’t be blown off
course.”  An FBI investigation is under way after bombings killed
three people, injured scores and sent smoke and flame soaring
near the Boston Marathon’s finish line. The explosions near
Copley Square occurred as recreational runners were finishing
about 2:50 p.m. local time yesterday, police said.  In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron led reaction to
the attack, describing the scenes as “shocking and horrific”
in a posting on Twitter.  Former Home Secretary John Reid called for vigilance, both
at the funeral and the marathon. He urged people protesting at
the funeral to stay within the law to allow police to
concentrate on the potential terrorist threat. The military
presence at the funeral increases its attraction to terrorists,
Reid said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
