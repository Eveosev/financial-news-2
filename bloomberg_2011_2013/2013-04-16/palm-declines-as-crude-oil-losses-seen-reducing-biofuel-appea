Palm oil  ended unchanged as
speculation that a decline in crude  oil prices  will reduce the
demand for biofuels countered optimism that food demand may
increase after futures dropped to the lowest level this year.  The contract for July delivery, the most active by open
interest and volume, closed at 2,301 ringgit ($757) a metric ton
on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives. Futures for June delivery
ended at 2,293 ringgit yesterday, the lowest level for the most-
active price since Dec. 17.  Brent crude fell below $100 a barrel for the first time
since July amid signs the global economy may slow, curbing fuel
demand. Growth in China slowed to 7.7 percent in the first
quarter from 7.9 percent in the previous three months,
government data showed yesterday. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Index of 24 commodities fell as much as 1.8 percent to the
lowest since July.  “The weaker the crude oil price, the biodiesel viability
becomes less,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment Bank
Bhd. “The CPO price has to decline to make it affordable again
to convert into biodiesel.”  Exports from  Malaysia  fell 4 percent to 648,275 tons in the
first 15 days of April from the same period in March, Intertek
said yesterday. Shipments declined 7.2 percent to 629,990 tons
in the same period, Societe Generale de Surveillance estimates.  Soybean oil  for July delivery gained 0.8 percent to 48.74
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade and soybeans climbed
0.7 percent to $13.6575 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery lost 0.3 percent to
close at 6,148  yuan  ($995) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange, while soybean oil fell 0.2 percent to 7,660 yuan a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
