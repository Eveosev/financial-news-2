Danling Zhou, a Boston University
graduate student, is in serious condition following the Boston
Marathon bombing, Boston Medical Center spokeswoman Gina Orlando
said in a telephone interview.  Boston University said yesterday that one student died and
another was seriously injured in the blasts two days ago. BU
President Robert A. Brown didn’t disclose the name of either
student in an e-mail.  Li Zhimin, a spokesman for the Chinese consulate in New
York, said that Zhou was injured in the bombing.  Li said in a telephone interview that a Chinese national,
Lingzi Lu, is missing. There is a graduate student at Boston
University by that name, according to the school’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
