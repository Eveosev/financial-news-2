Industrial metals extended declines
after economic data from  China  and the U.S., the two biggest
consumers, raised concern that demand may weaken.  Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.9
percent to $7,135.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,166 by 9:17 a.m. Shanghai time, putting it
on course for the lowest close since October 2011. Zinc lost 0.9
percent and nickel slumped as much as 2.2 percent to $15,350 a
ton, the lowest since Aug. 16. The  LME Index (LMEX)  of six primary base
metals fell 1.8 percent yesterday, after retreating 2.6 percent
on April 12.  China’s first-quarter gross domestic product growth and
fixed-asset investment, as well as March industrial production
all trailed estimates, yesterday’s data showed. Manufacturing in
the  New York  region expanded less than projected in April. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials dropped 2.3
percent, its worst loss since November.  “Now it’s difficult to say where copper can find
support,” Pang Juan, an analyst at Jinrui Futures Co., said by
phone from Shenzhen. “Given slumping precious metals, I think
it’s time to re-assess the outlook of metals.”  Copper for delivery in August on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 1.9 percent to 52,380  yuan  ($8,466) a ton, and the
metal for delivery in May on the Comex in New York dropped 0.8
percent to $3.2405 per pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
