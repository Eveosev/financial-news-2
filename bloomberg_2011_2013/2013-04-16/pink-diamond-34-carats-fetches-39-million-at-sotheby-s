A 34.65-carat pink diamond, known as “Princie,” sold for $39.3 million at Christie’s in New York today.  Estimated at $30 million, the stone failed to break the record for any jewel at auction of $46.2 million, paid in 2010 at Sotheby’s in Geneva for a pink diamond of 24.8 carats.  “Princie” drew just two bidders, with action starting at $20 million and continuing for only two minutes.  The winning offer came from Francois Curiel, international head of jewelry at Christies and president of Christies Asia, bidding in the room on behalf of an anonymous client.  The gem is considered one of the four most celebrated pink diamonds in the world. It was first recorded in the holdings of the Nizam, or monarch, of Hyderabad,  India , according to Christie’s.

The diamond was named after the youth.  Today’s price included the premium.  The diamond concluded Christie’s “Magnificent Jewels” auction, which tallied $81.4 million, with 82 percent of 295 lots sold.  Muse highlights include Laurie Muchnick, Mark Beech on  books .
