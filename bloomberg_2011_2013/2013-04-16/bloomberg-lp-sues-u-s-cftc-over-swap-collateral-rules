Bloomberg LP sued the top U.S.
derivatives regulator over rules setting higher collateral
standards for swaps than comparable futures, arguing the
requirements are arbitrary.  The  Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which by law is
required to evaluate the costs and benefits of proposed
regulations “offered only a fleeting, bare-bones discussion of
economic effects that contained no financial or quantitative
estimates,” Bloomberg LP, the parent company of  Bloomberg News ,
said in a complaint filed today in federal court in Washington.  The commission adopted “requirements that pose a
comparable threat to swap transparency” by giving
“determinative weight to how products are labeled,” according
to the complaint.  The current regulation harms plans by Bloomberg and other
to operate a swap-execution facilities, according to a news
release and letter to the CFTC dated March 11 from the company’s
outside counsel, Eugene Scalia, a partner at Gibson Dunn &
Crutcher LLP.  The regulation “will drive liquidity away from
standardized swaps to ‘swap futures’ that lack the post-trade
transparency and regulatory requirements” that Congress
determined “would best further the public interest,” Bloomberg
said.  Steven Adamske , a spokesman for the CFTC, declined to
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Bloomberg LP v. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, 13-cv-00523, U.S. District Court,  District of
Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
