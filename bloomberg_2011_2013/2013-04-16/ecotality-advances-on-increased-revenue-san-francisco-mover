Ecotality Inc. (ECTY) , operator of the
second-largest U.S. network of public electric-car charging
stations, rose the most in more than three years after reporting
annual sales almost doubled.  Ecotality gained 35 percent to $1.30 at the close in New
York, the biggest increase since Sept. 25, 2009. Trading volume
was a 12-fold increase from the three-month average for the
shares, which have almost tripled this year. Vista Partners
initiated coverage of Ecotality today with a 12-month price
target of $3.70.  Revenue for 2012 increased 93 percent to $54.7 million,
according to a statement released after the close of regular
trading yesterday. The San Francisco-based company said its
fourth-quarter net loss narrowed to $2.28 million from $6.7
million a year earlier.  ChargePoint Inc. operates the largest network of car-
charging stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
