The average price of benchmark OPEC
crudes ended its longest run above $100 a barrel after dropping
below that level for the first time since July amid signs the
global economic recovery is faltering.  The so-called OPEC basket, a weighted average of the main
grades produced by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, slipped to $98.56 a barrel yesterday, according to an
e-mail today from the group’s Vienna-based secretariat. It’s the
first time OPEC’s reference price slipped below $100 since July
16 and ends an unprecedented 191-day spell above that threshold.  Oil prices slumped this year as  Europe  struggled to move
beyond its debt crisis, China showed signs of a slowdown, and
unemployment levels remained elevated in the U.S. The decline
brings prices in line with the target cited by  Ali Al-Naimi , oil
minister of Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude exporter,
who has described $100 as “reasonable” for consumers and
producers.  The OPEC Reference Basket of Crudes is composed of Saharan
Blend from Algeria, Girassol from  Angola , Oriente from Ecuador,
Iran Heavy from the Islamic republic of Iran, Basra Light from
Iraq,  Kuwait  Export from Kuwait, Es Sider from Libya, Bonny
Light from Nigeria, Qatar Marine from Qatar, Arab Light from
Saudi Arabia, Murban from the United Arab Emirates and Merey
from  Venezuela .  OPEC will next meet to view its collective production
target on May 31 in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
