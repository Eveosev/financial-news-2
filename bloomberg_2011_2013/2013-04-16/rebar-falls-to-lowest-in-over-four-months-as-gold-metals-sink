Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  dropped to the lowest in more than four months,
pressured by a broad selloff in metals, led by gold’s plunge.  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 2 percent to 3,665 yuan ($592) a metric
ton, the lowest for a most-active future since Dec. 12, before
trading at 3,716 at 10:34 a.m. local time.  Gold slumped, extending the biggest decline since 1983 and
deepening a  bear market  while copper traded near the lowest
level since December 2011 and  China ’s stocks fell to a three-
month low.  “The fundamentals become irrelevant in a broad selloff
like this,” Dang Man, analyst at Maike Futures Group, said by
phone from Xi’an today. “Rebar and other industrial commodities
are suffering from concerns that systemic risk is rising.”  China’s gross domestic product rose 7.7 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday,
compared with the 8 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 41 analysts and 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter.
March industrial production gained less than estimated.  “Weaker-than-expected growth in the Chinese economy will
play a role going forward, reducing demand for the building
material,” Dang said. “We are now expecting to see rebar
prices fall further.”  The average  spot price  for rebar was 0.2 percent lower at
3,637  yuan  yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was little changed
at $140.90 a dry ton yesterday, The Steel Index Ltd. data show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
