Brent crude  fell below $100 a
barrel for the first time since July on signs economic growth
will slow, curbing demand. West Texas Intermediate oil was
little changed before a report that may show a U.S. supply gain.  Brent futures dropped 0.7 percent as the  International
Monetary Fund  cut its global growth forecast and urged European
policy makers to take action to bolster growth. Futures tumbled
yesterday after data showed  China’s economy  expanded at a slower
pace than expected last quarter. A government report tomorrow
will probably show that U.S. crude supplies gained  1.2 million
barrels  last week to 390.1 million, the highest level since July
1990, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “Brent fell below $100 because of the economic outlook in
 Europe  and China,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist
at Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis , which oversees
$1.4 billion. “The picture in Europe looks horrible and the
Chinese growth rate is slowing, which means oil demand isn’t
going to rise as much as we expected.”  Brent oil for June settlement fell 72 cents to $99.91 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract dropped to $98 earlier. May futures expired at $100.39
yesterday. The volume of all futures traded was 94 percent above
the 100-day average at 4:51 p.m. New York time.  WTI crude for May delivery rose 1 cent to settle at $88.72
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The volume of all
futures traded was 43 percent above the 100-day average. Prices
earlier fell as much as $2.65 to $86.06.  Supply Increase  Prices gained after the  American Petroleum Institute 
reported U.S.  inventories  fell 6.66 million barrels last week to
384.1 million, down from the highest level in almost 32 years.
The May contract rose 24 cents to $88.95 in electronic trading
at 4:51 p.m. It was $88.75 before the report was released at
4:30 p.m.  The front-month Brent grade traded at a premium of $11.19
to the May WTI contract.  Oil rebounded from the day’s lows as equities rallied. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained 1.4 percent and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  rose 1.1 percent.  The global economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, less
than the 3.5 percent forecast in January, after 3.2 percent
growth in 2012, the Washington-based IMF said today, cutting its
2013 prediction a fourth consecutive time. The IMF sees the euro
area shrinking 0.3 percent, compared with a 0.2 percent drop
estimated in January, with  France  joining Spain and Italy in
contracting.  Macro Economy  “As with many times in the past, oil has been used as the
tool to express concerns about the macro economy,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research
company in  London .  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in  Mannheim ,
 Germany , said its German  index of investor and analyst
expectations , which aims to predict economic developments six
months in advance, fell to 36.3 from 48.5 in March. Economists
Comdty  Equity surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a drop to 41.  Factory  output  in the U.S. fell 0.1 percent in March,
figures from the  Federal Reserve  showed today in  Washington ,
compared with 0.1 percent gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  China’s gross domestic product in the first quarter rose
7.7 percent from a year earlier, the Beijing-based National
Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. That compares with the 8
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey and 7.9 percent in
the prior quarter.  The  International Energy Agency , the  Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries  and the EIA cut their forecasts
for 2013 global oil demand last week.  ‘Important Marker’  “Falling below $100 was an important marker,” said
Soozhana Choi, Deutsche Bank AG’s head of energy research in
Washington. “The disappointing Chinese GDP data yesterday was a
big catalyst, but Brent was already falling because of the
downgrades in demand last week.”  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably declined by 800,000
barrels, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in the
Bloomberg survey before tomorrow’s Energy Information
Administration report.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
while the government requires that reports be filed with the
EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical unit, for its weekly
survey.  “The market is responding to a weaker macroeconomic
outlook and not the fundamentals of oil,” said Julius Walker,
global energy markets strategist at UBS Securities LLC. “U.S.
crude supplies have been rising but product stocks are very
tight.”  OPEC Basket  The basket of 12 crude grades used as a reference by OPEC
also fell below $100 for the first time since July. The basket
was at $98.56 yesterday, according to an e-mail from the group’s
Vienna-based secretariat.  The decline brings prices in line with the target cited by
 Ali Al-Naimi , oil minister of  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest
crude exporter, who has described $100 as “reasonable” for
consumers and producers.  “The Saudis have suggested that $100 is a good price,”
O’Grady said. “Now that we’ve dipped below $100, you should
start to hear rattling from some members of the cartel. There
will be calls to cut production to boost prices.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 24 percent, down from 25.8 percent yesterday.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 666,635
contracts as of 4:35 p.m. It totaled 858,007 contracts
yesterday, 47 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.78 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
