U.S. Bancorp (USB) , the nation’s largest
regional lender, fell the most in the KBW Bank Index after
reporting first-quarter revenue that missed analysts’ estimates.  U.S. Bancorp declined 1.7 percent, or 57 cents, to $32.74
at 9:41 a.m. in  New York  trading, the worst performer in the 24-
company index. Net income climbed 6.7 to $1.43 billion, or 73
cents a share, from $1.34 billion, or 67 cents, a year earlier,
as the company set aside less for soured loans, the Minneapolis-
based bank said today in a statement. That matched the 73-cent
 average estimate  of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Banks including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Wells Fargo & Co .
are relying on cost reductions and smaller loan-loss reserves to
help boost profits amid a revenue slump. At U.S. Bancorp,
revenue declined 1.1 percent to $4.87 billion, missing the $5.03
billion average  estimate  of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “This year will be a harder year for revenue growth,”
Chief Executive Officer  Richard Davis , 55, said on a conference
call following the results.  The drop in net revenue was driven by a decline in
noninterest income, which fell 3.3 percent to $2.17 billion.
Mortgage banking revenue decreased 11 percent to $401 million.  “Banks reflect the economy, which is a slow-growth,
uncertain time,” Chief Financial Officer Andrew Cecere said in
a phone interview today. “Banks are just a reflection of
that.”  U.S. Bancorp set aside $403 million to cover soured loans
in the first quarter, a 16 percent decline from a year earlier.
The lender cut noninterest expenses by 3.5 percent to $2.47
billion from a year earlier.  The bank said in March it will increase its share
repurchases by $370 million to $2.25 billion and ask its board
to raise its second-quarter dividend 18 percent to 23 cents.  U.S. Bancorp has gained 2.5 percent this year, trailing the
8.1 percent advance of the bank index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
