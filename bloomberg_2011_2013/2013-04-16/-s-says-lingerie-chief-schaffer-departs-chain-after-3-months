Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , the
U.K.’s largest clothing retailer, said Janie Schaffer, the head
of its lingerie division, has left after only three months,
increasing pressure on Chief Executive Officer  Marc Bolland .  The departure of Schaffer, who joined early this year as
lingerie and beauty director from the post of chief creative
officer at Victoria’s Secret, was confirmed by M&S spokesman
Daniel Himsworth. Schaffer struggled to handle both the creative
and business sides of the position and was frustrated at not
having as much power as she wanted to overhaul the division,
according to a person who asked to not be identified.  Chief Executive Officer Marc Bolland has been under
pressure to revive sales in the retailer’s general merchandise
division after seven straight quarters of decline. Bolland in
November described Schaffer as an “exciting, new, external
talent.” Known as the “Knicker Queen,” she had previously
begun her own lingerie chain, Knickerbox, and had worked at M&S
in her twenties.  Retail Week reported the departure earlier today.  Lingerie accounts for 32.9 percent of Marks & Spencer’s
clothing sales, and 12.4 percent of its overall U.K. revenue,
Verdict research estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
