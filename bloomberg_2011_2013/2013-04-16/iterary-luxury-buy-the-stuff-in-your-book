Some of the best style guides are in the pages of novels. Take "The Orient Express," Gregor von Rezzori's last book. Loot thought it might be useful and fun to reduce the authorâ€™s painstaking literary labors to a depraved shopping list.  In the book, an aging businessman consumed by ennui has boarded the newly refurbished  Orient Express  and begun to size up his fellow passengers. The following is his assessment of the youngest member of a British family that has doddered into the dining car.   He had the immediate elegance of a Rolls- Royce salesman, and everything about him observed the same standards of quality. One got a whiff of his  Floris  eau de toilette without its being obtrusive; his hair, chestnut brown except for the snow at the temples, shone from the brisk strokes of Asprey brushes; his chalk-striped suit betrayed the master hand of  Huntsman ; beneath it, snow-white Turnbull & Asser linen was discreetly visible; his shoes came from the workshop of  Lobb . He was just as much a walking testimonial for trademarked consumer articles as any wearer of becrocodiled polo shirts, Levi's jeans, or Adidas shoes; but his status symbols were more esoteric, legible only to the eyes of richer initiates.
