Japan , the world’s biggest importer
of liquefied natural gas, added 1,394 megawatts of clean energy
capacity, most of it solar, between April last year and the end
of January, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said in
a statement.  Meanwhile, applications have been approved for above-market
rates for clean energy projects equal to more than a quarter of
installed renewable capacity. Projects approved under Japan’s
feed-in tariffs totaled 7,368 megawatts of capacity by the end
of January, according to the statement.  Japan had 26,940 megawatts of clean energy capability at
the end of 2012, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Solar is the dominant form, accounting for about a third of all
renewable energy, according to the data.  The additions follow the introduction of an incentive
program begun in July to increase clean energy such as wind and
solar after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The ministry approved non-residential solar projects
totaling 5,749 megawatts, residential solar worth 958 megawatts,
and wind worth 570 megawatts, according to the statement.
Biomass, geothermal and small hydro accounted for the remainder
of the applications.  To contact the reporter on this story:
