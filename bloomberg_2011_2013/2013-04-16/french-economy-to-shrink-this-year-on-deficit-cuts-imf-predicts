The French economy will probably
shrink this year as President  Francois Hollande  seeks to cut the
 budget deficit , confidence remains lackluster and exports flag,
the International Monetary Fund predicted.  Gross domestic product  will probably decline 0.1 percent in
2013 before expanding 0.9 percent next year, the Washington-
based fund said in its World Economic Outlook report.  The forecast compares with the 0.1 percent expansion this
year that the European Commission is predicting and underlines
the challenge facing Hollande as he tries to revive Europe’s
second-largest economy. Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  will
publish his department’s latest projections tomorrow.  The IMF’s prediction of an economic contraction reflects
“a combination of fiscal consolidation, poor export performance
and low confidence,” IMF economist  Olivier Blanchard  wrote in
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
