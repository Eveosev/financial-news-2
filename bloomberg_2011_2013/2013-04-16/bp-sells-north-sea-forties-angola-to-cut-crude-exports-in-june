BP Plc sold a cargo of  North Sea 
Forties crude, the first May loading lot to trade. OAO Lukoil’s
Litasco bought Russian Urals grade at the highest differential
in four months.  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will cut
crude exports in June to 52 cargoes, seven less than in May, a
preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  BP sold Forties F0502 for loading May 1 to May 3 to Total
SA at a $1.45 a barrel discount to the cash cost of Brent,
Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk for June, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window. That’s 30 cents less than its offer yesterday  Glencore International Plc bid unsuccessfully for a May 1
to May 5 cargo at 70 cents less than Dated Brent and for May 4
to May 9 loading crude at minus 55 cents, the survey showed.
That compares with a deal on April 11 at a 60 cents discount.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 24 cents to a discount of 47 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $99.19 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $100.47 in the previous session. The June
contract was at $99.20 at the same time today, a 1 cent premium
to May. The front-month contract dropped below $100 for the
first time since July 12.  The Buzzard share in Forties blend dropped to 44 percent
for the week ending April 14, from 45 percent a week earlier, BP
said on its website.  Mediterranean/Urals  Litasco bought Urals for April 29 to May 3 from Vitol Group
at 30 cents less than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to
Augusta,  Italy , the Platts survey showed. That’s the smallest
discount since Dec. 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Total failed to buy Urals at minus $1.95 to Dated Brent on
a delivered basis to Rotterdam, according to the survey. That’s
the same level as the previous trade on April 9.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 11 cents to 50 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the least since Feb. 1. In northwest
Europe, the  discount  was at $1.87 a barrel compared with $2.07
at yesterday’s close.  The Caspian Pipeline Consortium will in May increase daily
crude shipments from the  Black Sea  by 5.1 percent from this
month, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend dropped 3 cents to $3.12
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Angolan exports will fall in June to 49.93 million barrels,
or 1.66 million barrels a day, the plan shows. That compares
with 56.71 million barrels, or 1.83 million barrels a day in
May, according to a separate schedule.  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, bought 2
million barrels of Nigerian Bonny Light from Royal Dutch Shell
Plc for loading in June, according to three people with
knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified as the
information is confidential.  The Nigeria schedule for June is expected to be published
later this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
