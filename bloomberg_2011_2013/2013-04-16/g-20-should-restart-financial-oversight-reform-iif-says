The Group of 20 economies should
renew efforts to create a more uniform global system of
financial oversight and increase policy cooperation, the
Institute of International Finance said.  “Regulatory fragmentation and lack of policy coordination
threaten to add considerable headwinds to a global economic
recovery that is still struggling to gain traction,” IIF
President and Chief Executive Officer Tim Adams wrote in a
letter today to officials attending the spring meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank this week in
 Washington .  The International Monetary and Financial Committee, a panel
that advises the IMF’s board of governors, “should re-engage
members -- especially major countries -- in economic policy
coordination, moving forward from the complex mutual assessment
process to a more direct commitment by major economies to
coordinate their policies for their benefits as well as those of
the global economy,” Adams said in the letter.  The Washington-based IIF represents international financial
companies, with a board of directors that includes executives
from banks including HSBC Holdings Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
