The dollar strengthened, rising
from near a seven-week low against the euro, as a decline in
stocks boosted demand for the currency as a refuge.  The Canadian dollar fell against its U.S. counterpart
before the central bank’s latest interest-rate decision.
Britain’s pound slid to a one-month low against the euro after
U.K. unemployment rose, while Sweden’s krona dropped after the
Riksbank delayed increases to  interest rates  to the second half
of 2014. The euro erased its advance against the yen as former
policy maker Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said the  European Central Bank 
needs to find ways to stop the currency’s appreciation.  “It’s a small bit of risk-off” supporting the U.S.
currency, said Kathleen Brooks, research director in London at
Forex.com, a unit of online currency-trading company Gain
Capital Holdings Inc. “The closer we got to $1.32, profit
taking was going to come in, which was going to thwart the
potential for a sustained upward move” in the euro against its
U.S. peer, she said.  The dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.3128 per euro at
8:49 a.m.  New York  time, after sliding to $1.3202 yesterday, the
weakest level since Feb. 25. It gained 0.4 percent to 97.96 yen.
The euro was little changed at 128.60 yen, after earlier jumping
by as much as 1 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  sank 1 percent, capping its
longest losing streak since January. Futures on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.7 percent.  Loonie Drops  Canada’s so-called loonie fell 0.5 percent to C$1.0262 per
 U.S. dollar . One loonie bought 97.45 U.S. cents.  The rate on overnight loans between commercial banks will
remain at 1 percent for the 21st consecutive meeting in a
decision at 10 a.m. in Ottawa, according to all 23 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The statement, together with a quarterly economic forecast,
will be followed by a press conference with Governor  Mark Carney , who is due to replace  Mervyn King  as head of the  Bank of
England  in July.  Sterling depreciated 0.3 percent to 86.06 pence per euro,
after reaching 86.37 pence, the weakest level since March 15. It
dropped 0.7 percent to $1.5251.  U.K. unemployment as measured by International Labour
Organization methods rose by 70,000 to 2.56 million, the most
since November 2011, the  Office for National Statistics  said
today in London. Minutes of the Bank of England’s April meeting
released today showed King pushed for additional stimulus for a
third month before being outvoted.  Krona’s Slide  Sweden’s krona slid 1 percent to 8.4655 per euro. It was
1.4 percent weaker at 6.4502 against the dollar.  The Riksbank kept the repo rate at 1 percent after cutting
it four times since December 2011. The bank lowered its forecast
for the rate to 0.9 percent for the first quarter next year from
a previous assessment of 1.2 percent, and signaled increases are
unlikely until the second half of 2014.  A stronger euro “is a challenge for the ECB,” Bini Smaghi
told  Tom Keene  and Sara Eisen on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance.”  “They need to do something,” he said.  Bini Smaghi “obviously was referring to the fact that
price competitiveness is an issue in southern Europe,” said
Shant Movsesian, a foreign-exchange strategist at 4Cast Ltd. in
London. “It’s just the fact that he called for lower levels in
the euro and off it came.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
