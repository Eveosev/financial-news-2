Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) 
dropped to a six-week low as brent crude fell below $100 a
barrel for the first time since July and before the world’s
largest petrochemicals maker posts first-quarter results.  Shares of the company known as Sabic lost 1.1 percent to
92.5 riyals, the lowest level since March 6, at the close in
 Riyadh . The stock has tumbled 5.9 percent in the past four days,
the biggest such drop in a year. Sabic unit  Saudi Arabian
Fertilizer Co. (SAFCO)  on April 14 reported first-quarter profit that
missed analysts estimates.  Brent crude, down 10 percent this year, retreated amid
signs global economic growth may slow, curbing fuel demand.
China’s economy grew 7.7 percent in the first quarter, its
statistics bureau said yesterday, less than the 8 percent median
forecast in a survey of 41 economists. Gold prices tumbled 14
percent in the previous two days.  “The global markets don’t look particularly encouraging,
gold prices are going down, oil is down,” Mahmood Akbar, an
analyst at Riyadh-based NCB Capital, said by telephone. “Some
investors are booking profit.”  Sabic shares had gained 9.5 percent this year before their
four-day retreat. First-quarter profit is expected to fall 10
percent to 6.53 billion riyals ($1.74 billion), according to the
mean estimate of  eight analysts  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
