Stockmann Oyj (STCBV)  said full-year profit
will miss forecasts as a recession in the northernmost country
using the euro hurt the Finnish department-store owner’s first-
quarter sales. The shares fell to a four-year low.  The operating loss in the first three months of 2013
widened to 34.5 million euros ($45.1 million) from 16.2 million
euros a year earlier, the Helsinki-based company said in a
statement today. The loss was wider than the 22.4 million-euro
average of five analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Finland’s general retail market, which accounts for about
half of the company’s revenue, has been “exceptionally weak,”
Stockmann said, and operating profit this year will only match
the figure for 2012 instead of rising. The volume of retail
sales in the country fell 0.6 percent in February, compared with
an increase of 5.9 percent a year earlier, according to
 Statistics Finland .  The company “expects the retail market in the Nordic
countries to remain weak also during the rest of 2013,”
Stockmann said. “Consumers’ purchasing power is not growing,
and the general cost level is estimated to increase.”  Stockmann  dropped  as much as 7.7 percent to 10.75 euros,
the lowest intraday price since April 22, 2009, and traded down
7.1 percent at 10:47 a.m. in Helsinki. The volume after 45
minutes of trading matched the three-month full-day average.  SEB AB and Nordea Bank AB cut recommendations on
Stockmann’s shares over the past month, citing weaker sales.
 Kesko Oyj (KESBV) , a Finnish food and home-goods retailer, said
yesterday that first-quarter sales fell 7.2 percent to 2.2
billion euros, in part because the quarter had three fewer
shopping days than a year earlier.  Stockmann said it plans to lay off all department-store and
administrative  workers  for 12 working days to achieve 7 million
euros in savings by mid-2014. It’s also reducing 10 million
euros of fixed expenses in the department-store and fashion-
chain units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
