Grangemouth, Scotland’s sole  oil
refinery , will halt several units for maintenance work in
September, according to two people with direct knowledge of the
partial shutdown plan.  Work on some units will last for as many as 28 days, the
people said, asking not to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak about the plans.  Richard Longden , a
communications manager at Ineos Group AG, which runs the plant,
declined to comment from Rolle, Switzerland.  Grangemouth is part owned by Ineos through its Petroineos
venture with PetroChina Co., and jet fuel from the plant is
delivered to airports in Scotland, including Edinburgh Airport.  The plant near Edinburgh can process 210,000 barrels of
crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A third of
its output is  diesel  and heating oil, and almost a quarter is
gasoline, according to the website of the U.K.’s Petroleum
Industry Association based in London.  The oil refinery is one of seven operating in the U.K.,
down from nine in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
