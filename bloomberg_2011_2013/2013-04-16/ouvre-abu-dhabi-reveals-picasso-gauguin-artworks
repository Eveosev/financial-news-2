Louvre Abu Dhabi  -- a Gulf offshoot of the  Paris museum  that’s set to open in 2015 -- today revealed pieces from its permanent collection to reporters, showing works by Picasso, Gauguin, Manet and Magritte.  The 130 paintings, miniatures, sculptures and other artworks will be on public display (April 22-July 20) at an exhibition center on the island of Saadiyat in Abu Dhabi, near the future Louvre, the museum’s administrators said.  Designed by architect  Jean Nouvel , the Abu Dhabi venue will be the Louvre’s first branch outside  France . The project is bringing the Louvre and French partner museums a total of 1 billion euros ($1.31 billion) over 30 years.  “The main feature of this museum is its exclusivity,” said Olivier Gabet, the curatorial director deputy for Agence France Museums, who explained that many of the pieces were coming from private collections and hadn’t been seen in public before.  As an example, Gabet cited Picasso’s “Portrait of a Lady” (1928) -- a gouache, ink and collage work on paper bought from a European family who got it as a gift from the artist.  Also acquired from a private collection is Gauguin’s “Children Wrestling” (1888), said Gabet.  Other artworks featured in the Louvre Abu Dhabi exhibition -- titled “The Birth of a Museum” -- include Manet’s “The Bohemian” (1861-2), Magritte’s “The Subjugated Reader” (1928) and Klee’s “Oriental Bliss” (1938).  Muse highlights include  Laurie Muchnick  and  Mark Beech  on books,  Jorg von Uthmann  on Paris art and  Jeremy Gerard  on U.S. theater.
