Biosev SA (BSEV3) , a Louis Dreyfus Holding
BV unit in Brazil, has raised as much as 814.4 million reais
($409.8 million) in an initial public offering to fund
expansion.  Brazil’s No. 2 sugar-cane processor sold 53.7 million
voting shares at 15 reais each and 9.35 million reais of put
options, the country’s securities regulator Comissao de Valores
Mobiliarios said today on its website.  The Sao Paulo-based company plans to pay down debt,
including almost $300 million of bonds issued in 2009 as well as
finance new investments, Salim Morsy, an analyst at Bloomberg
New Energy Finance, said in an e-mail today. The put options, by
allowing investors to sell back their shares at the same price
they bought them for plus interest, were meant to ensure a fully
subscribed offering, he said.  “Embedding put options in the IPO is a testament to the
current dour nature of the Brazilian equity market and the
generally gloomy mood of the local sugar-cane industry,” Morsy
said.  Biosev, which operates 13 mills in Brazil, plans to boost
capacity and may buy or build more plants, according to a
prospectus of the sale.  The company planned the IPO for the middle of last year and
delayed it in August, citing market conditions.  Banco BTG Pactual (BBTG11) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) ,
 Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  and Banco Itau BBA SA coordinated the
transaction, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
