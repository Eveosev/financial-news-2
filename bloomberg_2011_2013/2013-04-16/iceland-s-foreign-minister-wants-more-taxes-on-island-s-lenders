Iceland should impose additional
taxes on the country’s lenders to help cut Treasury debt by 20
percent within five years, Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson
said.  Banks should pay 15 billion kronur ($128 million) in an
annual tax on what he called “super profits” over the next
five years, Skarphedinsson wrote on news website  Visir.is  today.
Iceland’s banks earned 260 billion kronur since 2008, including
66 billion kronur last year, according to the official.  Skarphedinsson also proposed imposing a special 0.1285
percent tax on the debt of financial companies under
administration to gain 13 billion kronur annually.  By imposing these taxes, Iceland’s Treasury could obtain
additional revenue of 140 billion kronur, he said.
Skarphedinsson didn’t immediately respond to a call from
Bloomberg News to his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
