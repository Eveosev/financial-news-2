U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew declined to estimate the date when the U.S. might hit the
debt ceiling, citing the budget cuts in the sequestration as one
of the reasons making a forecast of U.S. spending and revenue
difficult.  Lew, speaking during a hearing before the House Budget
Committee today, urged Congress to extend the limit, which was
suspended until May 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
