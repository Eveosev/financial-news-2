U.S.  stocks  rallied, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rebounding from its biggest drop since November, as housing starts and earnings from  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  to Johnson & Johnson topped estimates.  All 10 industry groups advanced as raw-materials and consumer-staples companies gained the most, rising at least 1.7 percent.
