Peruvian government bonds rose,
pushing down yields the most in a week, as new-home construction
in the U.S. jumped more than forecast, fueling demand for
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s sol bond due February 2042 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.06 percent at
2:49 p.m. in Lima, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price advanced 0.59 centimo to 126.72 centimos per sol.  U.S. housing starts climbed 7 percent to a 1.04 million
annual rate, the most since June 2008 and exceeding the 930,000
median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Demand for
the 2042 bonds from foreigners outweighed the prospect of
increased supply after the government announced an auction for
tomorrow, said Diego Alvarez, a trader at  Banco Internacional
del Peru SAA. (INTERBC1)   “There’s a lot of demand for assets offering a higher
yield after the rally” in U.S. Treasuries, Alvarez said by
phone from Lima.  The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell to a four-
month low of 1.68 percent yesterday. Yields rose four basis
points to 1.72 percent today.  Peru will offer as much as 300 million soles of the 2042
notes tomorrow and as much as 500 million soles in 2023 bonds,
the Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5880 per U.S. dollar
at the close, according to prices from Datatec. The central bank
bought $100 million in U.S. currency today, according to its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
