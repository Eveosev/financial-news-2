China ’s media regulator stepped up
controls on news organizations’ use of social media, including
barring the retransmission of content from overseas media and
websites without permission.  The State Administration of Radio Film and Television also
said that editorial employees must get permission to set up
microblogs for work purposes and to release any information they
acquire when on duty, according an article dated yesterday on
the regulator’s online publication chinaxwcb.com.  The rules also ban the publication of rumors, urge
reporters to focus on “positive” publicity and prohibit the
publication of materials from freelance writers, civil-society
groups and commercial organizations without approval, it said.  China, the world’s largest Internet market by users,
censors social-media comments critical of the ruling Communist
Party. The government also seeks to ensure that news available
online comes from the nation’s official media.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
