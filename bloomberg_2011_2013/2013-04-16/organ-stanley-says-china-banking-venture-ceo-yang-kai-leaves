Yang Kai has left as the chief
executive officer of  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Huaxin Securities Co.,
according to Xu Li, Morgan Stanleyâ€™s  China  spokeswoman.  Morgan Stanley Huaxin, in which the U.S. lender owns a
third, started operations in 2011, joining Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. in gaining access to underwriting
business in China through ventures with local brokerages.  Morgan Stanley formed the partnership with Huaxin
Securities Co. after it ended in 2010 its 15-year involvement in
China International Capital Corp., the first Sino-foreign
investment bank and once the top-ranked underwriter of share
sales in the country. Yang, formerly a managing director of
Morgan Stanley, was named CEO of Morgan Stanley Huaxin in 2011
and Wang Wenxue, chairman of Huaxin Securities, was appointed
chairman of the venture.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
