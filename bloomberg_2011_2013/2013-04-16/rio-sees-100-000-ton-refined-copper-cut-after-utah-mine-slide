Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s
second-biggest mining company, said the wall slide at its copper
mine in Utah may cut full-year refined output by about 100,000
metric tons, slicing its previous forecast by about one third.  Ore production at Kennecott Utah Copper’s Bingham Canyon
mine remains suspended and the timing of a restart is being
studied, London-based  Rio Tinto  said today in its quarterly
production report. A  pit wall failure  occurred on April 10 after
the slide occurred along a geotechnical fault line.  The outage could leave the global copper market balance
“quite tight” this year, Nomura International Plc said last
week. Bingham Canyon, the world’s biggest man-made hole, has an
annual production capacity of as much as 300,000 tons a year of
the metal used in tubes and wiring, according to Rio’s website.
Last year, the mine produced 163,200 tons.  “It is estimated that 2013 mined and refined copper
production at Kennecott  Utah  Copper will be less than previously
anticipated by approximately 125,000 tons and 100,000 tons,
respectively,” the company said. “As a result, Rio Tinto share of
mined and refined copper production in 2013 is expected to be approximately
540,000 tonnes and 205,000 tonnes, respectively.”  Rio  dropped  0.2 percent to close at A$54.98 in Sydney.  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company, fell 0.5
percent. The price of copper in  London  gained 0.5 percent to
$7,235 a ton at 3:58 Sydney time. It has dropped 11 percent in
the past six months.  Mongolian Mine  Producers are struggling with falling ore grades at aging
mines, while new large discoveries are scarce, bolstering the
outlook for prices. Rio Tinto’s $6.6 billion Oyu Tolgoi  copper
mine  is still scheduled to start commercial production in June,
subject to resolution of a number of issues with the government,
the company said today. First concentrate was produced in
January, it said.  Copper will have a surplus of 154,000 tons this year,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in an April 12 report.  Rio reported a more-than-estimated 6 percent rise in iron
ore output as the company expanded mines in  Australia . Its share
of production was 48.3 million tons, from 45.6 million tons a
year earlier, beating the 47.7 million-ton median estimate of
six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and compares with the 52
million tons produced in the previous quarter.  Equity and commodity markets tumbled after  China , the
biggest metals user, yesterday reported economic growth
unexpectedly lost momentum last quarter, further pressuring
profit expectations for global miners.  BHP Billiton  said last
week it expects annual Chinese GDP growth to moderate toward 6
percent later this decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
