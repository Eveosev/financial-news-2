Germany’s third-biggest bank by assets, said profit rose 15
percent to 2.4 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in 2012, boosted by
interest income.  “KfW’s group profit this year is again on a very high
level, it is significantly above the sustainable income
potential and cannot be continued into the future,”  Ulrich Schroeder , chief executive officer of the Frankfurt-based
lender, said in a statement today. “We see sustainable earning
level at around 1.2 billion euros.”  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest lender based in

economy, reported net income of 6 million euros.  KfW’s net interest income rose to a record 2.9 billion
euros in 2012 from 2.4 billion euros. The bank, which is fully
state-owned, is rated AAA by Standard & Poor’s.  The bank said it core Tier 1 capital ratio under fully
