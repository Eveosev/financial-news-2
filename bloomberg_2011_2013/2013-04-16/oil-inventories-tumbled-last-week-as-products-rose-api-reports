Oil supplies tumbled 6.66 million barrels to 384.1 million last week, the  American Petroleum Institute  said.  Distillate fuel inventories  increased 1.26 million barrels to 115.4 million, the API’s weekly report showed.  Gasoline stockpiles  rose 253,000 barrels to 222.6 million.  Crude at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , climbed 1.07 million barrels to 51.1 million.  The Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, is scheduled to release its inventory report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  The government report may show supplies of oil increased 1.2 million barrels last week, according to the median of 11 responses in a  Bloomberg (DOEASCRD)  survey of analysts. Gasoline stockpiles dropped 800,000 barrels and distillate inventories declined 350,000 barrels in the survey.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with the Energy Department for its weekly survey.

The contract, which settled at $88.72, traded at $88.75 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story: Moming Zhou in  New York  at  mzhou29@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dan Stets at  dstets@bloomberg.net
