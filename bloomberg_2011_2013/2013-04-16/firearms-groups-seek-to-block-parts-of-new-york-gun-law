Gun-rights advocates in  New York 
are seeking a court order to block enforcement of parts of a new
state law regulating the sale and possession of firearms and
ammunition.  The New York State Rifle and Pistol Association and other
groups sued Governor  Andrew Cuomo  last month, claiming the  law
is unconstitutional. They filed papers in federal court in
Buffalo yesterday seeking an injunction.  The association seeks an order blocking enforcement of
provisions of the law that limit to seven the number of rounds
that can be loaded into a magazine and broaden the definition of
assault weapons.  “The challenged portions of the act will fail any
applicable standard of review for constitutional rights,” the
group said today in a statement.  After last year’s school massacre last year in Newtown,
 Connecticut , Cuomo pushed through legislation in weeks, making
New York the first state to respond to the killings. The measure
tightens restrictions on sales and closes gaps in a 2000 assault
weapon ban.  The governor today declined to comment on the request for
an injunction.  The case is New York State Rifle and Pistol Association
Inc. v. Cuomo, 1:13-cv-00291, U.S. District Court, Western
District of New York (Buffalo).  To contact the reporter on this story:
