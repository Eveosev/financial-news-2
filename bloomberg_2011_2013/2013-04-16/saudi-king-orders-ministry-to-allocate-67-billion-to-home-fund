Saudi Arabia ’s King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz ordered the Ministry of Finance to distribute 250
billion riyals ($67 billion) to build housing units in the Arab
world’s biggest economy, the official  Saudi Press Agency  said.  Land held by the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs
will be handed to the Ministry of Housing to build homes, the
news service said, citing an order by the king. The Housing
Ministry has full authority to implement the housing program, it
said.  The king in March 2011 ordered the construction of 500,000
houses for Saudis at a cost of 250 billion riyals. The kingdom
also raised the value of mortgages provided to nationals by the
country’s Real Estate Development Fund to 500,000 riyals from
300,000 riyals. The government fund provides interest-free loans
to citizens across the kingdom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
