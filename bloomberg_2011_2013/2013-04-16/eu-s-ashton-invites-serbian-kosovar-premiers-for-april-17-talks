The European Union invited the
prime ministers of  Serbia  and Kosovo for another round of talks
in Brussels tomorrow as the bloc prepares to release a report on
Serbia’s preparedness to begin membership talks.  “I have asked” Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic and his
Kosovar counterpart Hashim Thaci “to come in a constructive
spirit, ready to explore different options and agree to a mutual
compromise,” EU Foreign Policy chief Catherine Ashton said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Ashton’s invitation came just hours before Enlargement
Commissioner Stefan Fule was due to release a progress report on
Serbia that will say whether the Balkan nation has been granted
a date to start entry talks in June.  Serbia and Kosovo have been at loggerheads since the wars
of the 1990s that led to the breakup of  Yugoslavia . Kosovo is
recognized by the U.S. and 22 of the EU’s 27 members. Both need
deeper EU ties after the civil wars stunted the region’s
transition from communism. The European Commission said in
December that mending ties with Kosovo is the key for Serbia to
win a date to start entry talks.  The two prime ministers met April 2, the eighth such
meeting in six months, without any agreement. A week later,
Dacic’s nine-month-old Cabinet rejected an EU-mediated accord
and called for further negotiations with its breakaway province.  Dacic wants Thaci to grant Serbs in Kosovo’s northern
region decision-making rights on police and the judiciary and to
pledge to keep the  Kosovo  army out of Serbian communities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
