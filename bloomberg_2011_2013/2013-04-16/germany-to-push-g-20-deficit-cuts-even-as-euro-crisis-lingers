Germany  will press the world’s
biggest economies to adopt growth-friendly deficit-reduction
policies at a meeting this week even as its delegation sees the
euro area tumult dominating, a government official said.  Germany holds to deficit-reduction and debt stabilization
commitments agreed in Toronto in 2010 and will seek a discussion
among finance ministers due to gather in  Washington  this week on
ways to extend the pledge beyond 2016, the official said today.
He spoke to reporters in Berlin on condition of anonymity
because the negotiations have yet to take place.  Europe can’t escape a global trend of weakening economic
growth, although Germany shares the International Monetary
Fund’s assessment that global growth will rebound gradually in
the course of this year, the official said. The IMF’s assessment
of the outlook for the German economy matches the German
government’s, the official said, without providing estimates.  While European participants including Germany will be able
to point to progress at setting up a single supervisory
mechanism for the region’s banks, Germany maintains that the
 European Central Bank ’s monetary policy and its future tasks as
a bank supervisor have to be clearly separated, the official
said.  Among other topics to be discussed in Washington on the
occasion of the IMF’s spring meeting are  tax avoidance , profit
shifting and the fight against  tax havens , the official said.
Germany will call on the U.S. to implement an IMF governance
reform agreed in 2010, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
