Gold futures tumbled the most since
September 2011 in  Tokyo  after spot prices extended the biggest
drop in 30 years and the yen strengthened against the dollar,
spurring a sell-off. Silver, platinum and palladium also slid in
Tokyo.  Futures for delivery in February 2014 sank as much as 10
percent to 4,132 yen per gram ($1,324 an ounce), the lowest
intra-day level since August, on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
before trading at 4,170 yen at 11:14 a.m. local time. With
yesterday’s 8.2 percent decline, yen-priced gold has had its
biggest two-day slump since March 1982.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell as much as 1.9 percent
to $1,321.95 an ounce, the lowest since January 2011, after
losing 9.1 percent yesterday, the most since February 1983. Spot
gold prices have fallen 21 percent in 2013.  “It’s like a panic selling,” said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , the
general manager of research at Nihon Unicom Inc. in Tokyo. “For
Tokyo futures, they had a double whammy of spot gold’s decline
and the stronger yen.”  The yen weakened 0.3 percent to 97.06 per dollar after
appreciating 1.6 percent yesterday. A stronger Japanese currency
reduces the appetite for yen-based contracts.  On the Tokyo commodity bourse, silver for February delivery
fell 11 percent to 70 yen per gram. Platinum for the same
delivery lost 5.2 percent to 4,412 yen per gram and palladium
slid 5.4 percent to 2,043 yen per gram.  To contact the reporter for this story:
