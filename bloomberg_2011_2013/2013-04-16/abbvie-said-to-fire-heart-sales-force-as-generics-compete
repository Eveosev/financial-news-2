AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) , the drugmaker split
off from  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  this year, will fire its sales
force for heart drugs as the medicines lose patent protection
and face generic competition, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  The firings total in the mid-hundreds and are a mix of
AbbVie employees and contract workers, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to
speak about the issue.  AbbVie is shifting its focus from primary care, such as
drugs that treat a patient’s cholesterol, stroke or diabetes, to
so-called specialty medications in areas of unmet health needs,
Chief Financial Officer William Chase said in January. With the
cardiology drugs losing patent protection, the North Chicago,
Illinois-based company no longer needs a large sales force to
advertise them to doctors.  Chase in January called 2013 and 2014 “a time of
transition for AbbVie, as our lipid franchise experiences the
entry of generics.”  Among those drugs is TriCor, which began facing generic
competition in November. TriCor, along with related medication
Trilipix, generated $1.1 billion in U.S. sales for AbbVie last
year, the company said. Niaspan, an extended-release version of
a medicine to raise HDL or “good” cholesterol, also will face
copycats this year. It sold $911 million for AbbVie in 2012.  Chase in January estimated that sales of the two drugs will
fall by more than half this year.  Adelle Infante, an AbbVie spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the firings. AbbVie shares rose 2.4 percent to $42.45 at the
close in New York.  Generic Competition  “TriCor began facing generic competition in late 2012 and
several other products in our cardiovascular franchise will lose
patent exclusivity in 2013,” she said yesterday in an e-mail.  The company’s biggest product remains Humira, an injection
to treat the inflammatory disease rheumatoid arthritis. The
medicine sold $7.93 billion last year.  AbbVie’s experimental drug pipeline suffered a setback last
year when its partner, Reata Pharmaceuticals Inc., discontinued
development of a drug for chronic kidney disease. The company’s
top candidate in late-stage testing is a treatment for the viral
liver infection hepatitis C, which may compete with a product in
development by  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD)  This year, AbbVie suspended
trials of an experimental leukemia and lymphoma medicine after
two patients died.  AbbVie split from Abbott Laboratories on Jan. 1, leaving
the parent company with the original business’s medical device,
infant nutrition, generic drugs and diagnostics units. Since the
split, AbbVie’s  shares  had gained 21 percent and Abbott Park,
Illinois-based Abbott’s had increased  15 percent , as of
yesterday’s close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
