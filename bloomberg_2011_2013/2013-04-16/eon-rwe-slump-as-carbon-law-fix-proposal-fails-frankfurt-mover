EON SE and  RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s two
largest utilities, plunged in Frankfurt trading after the
European Parliament rejected a proposed change to emission-
trading rules that would allow the supply of carbon permits to
be curbed temporarily.  The European Union assembly voted against a plan to delay
the issuing of some new allowances in the 2013-2020 phase of the
EU’s emissions-trading system. The draft measure opposed by the
27-nation Parliament is meant to help bolster the price of EU
emission permits after they fell to a record low in January.  “EON to fall 3 percent to 4 percent on this based on our
models, but sentiment could hit it harder as  Europe  is now
turning its back on the environment and focusing on economy,”
John Musk, an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in  London , wrote in
a note.  EON declined as much as 5.5 percent, the most in five
months, and was down 4.6 percent at 13.80 euros as of 1:20 p.m.
local time. RWE lost as much as 4.9 percent, also the steepest
daily drop since November, and was last 2.5 percent lower at
29.39 euros.  Trading volumes were 23 percent more than the three-month
average for EON and 62 percent for RWE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
