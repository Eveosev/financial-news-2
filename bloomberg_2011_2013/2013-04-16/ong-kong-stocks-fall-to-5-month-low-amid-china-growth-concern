Hong Kong stocks fell, with the
benchmark index sliding to its lowest level in five months amid
concern about slower growth in  China .  China Minsheng Banking Corp. led declines among mainland
banks, falling 1.4 percent. Gold producer Zhaojin Mining
Industry Co. plunged 8.3 percent as the bullion extended its
biggest drop in three decades.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a
power-tool maker that counts North America as its biggest
market, fell 3.1 percent after bombs exploded near the finish
line of the Boston Marathon.  The Hang Seng Index dropped 1.2 percent to 21,513.32 as of
9:46 a.m. in Hong Kong, its lowest level since November. The
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland shares dropped 1.3
percent to 10,309.39.  “Brace yourselves today,” said Evan Lucas, a market
strategist at IG Markets Ltd., a provider of trading services in
 Melbourne . “The sell-off will be sharp and indiscriminate, loss
will be across the board, not even the defensives will escape
the flight to safety today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
