Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s
second-biggest mining company, said first-quarter iron ore
output rose a more-than-estimated 6 percent as the company
expanded mines in Australia.  Rio’s share of production was 48.3 million metric tons,
from 45.6 million tons a year earlier, the London-based company
said today in a statement. That beat the 47.7 million-ton median
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and compares with
the 52 million tons produced in the previous quarter.  “Our operations achieved a solid performance in the first
quarter, recovering rapidly from the seasonal weather
disruptions,” Chief Executive Officer Sam Walsh said in the
statement.  Equity and commodity markets tumbled after China, the
biggest metals user, yesterday reported economic growth
unexpectedly lost momentum last quarter, further pressuring
profit expectations for global miners.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
biggest mining company, said last week it expects annual Chinese
GDP growth to moderate toward 6 percent later this decade.  Rio fell 0.7 percent to A$54.67 at 3:13 p.m. in Sydney
trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
