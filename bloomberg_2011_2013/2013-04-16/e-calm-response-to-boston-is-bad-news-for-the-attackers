“Boston bombings shatter a national
sense of safety,” read  one headline  this morning. “A perfect
Marathon day, then the unimaginable,” read  another . These
summations were plausible enough, because yesterday’s attack was
the first successful strike against a U.S. city since Sept. 11,
2001. A national security official from the George W. Bush
administration  expressed  the same thought in even more dramatic
terms. “In some ways,” Juan Carlos Zarate said, “this ruptures
the psyche.”  Plausible -- but not, we’re glad to say, correct. What’s
striking about the initial response to this atrocity is how calm
it has been. There was no illusory sense of safety to shatter;
the Boston bombing was all too imaginable before the fact; and
the national psyche is intact. This measured and purposeful
reaction is the worst possible news for the perpetrators,
whomever they turn out to be. Rupturing the psyche is what
terrorism is supposed to achieve. If it fails to do that, it
fails, period.  In the years since the Sept. 11 attacks -- a shock on an
entirely different scale -- the country has learned to cope,
grudgingly but stoically, with the possibility of further
terrorist attacks and the elaborate security arrangements that
are designed to pre-empt them. Of course, one can argue about
the cost and effectiveness of these defenses, about the
infringements of liberty and the sheer nuisance, about how to
strike the right balance. But what critics deride as the
security state is a reality that most Americans recognize:
Terrorists of one sort or another are a threat we must live
with, a danger we can diminish but not eradicate. When the
defenses are evaded, as they will be from time to time, you
mourn, gather your resources and carry on. That’s the prevailing
mood after  Boston .  Partly thanks to those defenses, attacks like this have
been astonishingly rare in the U.S., which despite Sept. 11
remains one of the world’s most open societies. In countries
where terrorist attacks are almost routine, a different
challenge arises -- to avoid becoming entirely hardened to them.
One must hold on to the full measure of horror at the deliberate
maiming of innocents, never losing sight of the wickedness of
those responsible, even while refusing to succumb to shock and
paralysis. On a beautiful day in Boston, bombs went off,
stealing lives, piercing bodies and souls. Disgust at what
happened is unbounded, as it should be. Overreactions here and
there are to be expected, but there’s no derangement or excess
in the nation’s collective response.  The failures of intelligence and security, if any, will
need to be examined -- though not, we trust, in the desire to
find scapegoats among officials who are doing their best. The
country knows no effort will be spared in the search for the
attackers. It can take comfort in the zeal of first responders
who run to the victims. As President  Barack Obama  said today,
“If you want to know who we are, who America is, how we respond
to evil -- that’s it. Selflessly, compassionately, unafraid.”  Disgust, calm resolve and a steady sense of purpose are the
psyche’s main defenses against evil. Innocents have been killed
and grievously injured, but on the next day, those walls were
standing.  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:
