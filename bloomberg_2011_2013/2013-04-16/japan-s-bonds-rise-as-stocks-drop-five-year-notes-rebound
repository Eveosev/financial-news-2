Japan ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the 10-year yield down below 0.6 percent for the first
time in three sessions, as declines in domestic stocks boosted
demand for haven assets.  The five-year notes rebounded even after sales of the
securities drew the weakest  demand  since December 2011. The gap
between the average and low prices at the auction was the widest
since June 2008. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said today it will meet with
market participant tomorrow, following a separate meeting on
April 11 where the central bank said it would respond flexibly
to rising volatility. Japan’s Topix Index of shares slid 1.3
percent.  “The five-year auction was a touch weaker than expected,”
said Takuma Sugawara, a senior JGB strategist in Tokyo at
Societe Generale SA, one of the 24 primary dealers obliged to
bid at government bond sales. “We didn’t see a significant
lengthening of the tails and the results on the whole weren’t
too bad. The bond market will probably stabilize gradually.”  The yield on benchmark 10-year bonds fell as much as 6 1/2
basis points, or 0.065 percentage point, to 0.575 percent and
was at 0.59 percent at 3:19 p.m. in  Tokyo . It slid to a record
low 0.315 percent on April 5, according to Japan Bond Trading
Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. Ten-year bond
futures for June delivery rose 0.55 to 144.09.  The five-year rate dropped 1 1/2 basis point to 0.250
percent. The 20-year rate dropped three basis points to 1.475
percent.  Auction Tail  Today’s sale of about 2.5 trillion yen ($25.6 billion) of
five-year notes attracted bids valued at 3.09 times the amount
available, the weakest demand since December 2011, according to
Finance Ministry data. The so-called tail was 0.05, the longest
since June 2008. The ministry will  offer  about 1.2 trillion yen
of 20-year notes on April 18.  “Bond futures are being bought back as excessive concern
about the auction has eased,” said  Katsutoshi Inadome , a fixed-
income strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co. “The results were reasonable given the current
environment.”  BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said today he is keeping the
central bank’s exit strategy in mind after announcing on April 4
it will double monthly debt purchases to 7.5 trillion yen.  The central bank’s current-account balance rose to a record
61.4 trillion yen yesterday, a statement from the BOJ showed
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
