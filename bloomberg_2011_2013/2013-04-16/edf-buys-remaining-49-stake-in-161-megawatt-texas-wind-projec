EDF Renewable Energy, a U.S. unit
of the French utility  Electricite de France SA , bought the 49
percent stake of a Texas wind project that it didn’t already own
and expects to start construction in June.  It will use 87 General Electric Co. wind turbines at the
161-megawatt Spinning Spur II project, the San Diego-based unit
said today in a statement. EDF purchased the stake from Cielo
Wind Power LP.  EDF has a 10-year contract to sell the power and didn’t
name the buyer. The wind farm will be adjacent to EDF’s Spinning
Spur I in Oldham County, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of
Amarillo, which began producing power in December.  Sandi Briner, a spokeswoman for EDF Renewable Energy,
wouldn’t provide the purchase price or expected construction
cost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
