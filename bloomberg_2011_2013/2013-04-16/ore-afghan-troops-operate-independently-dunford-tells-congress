As many as five Afghan Army
brigades can operate independently compared with a single unit
that had a similar capability last year, according to Marine
Corps General Joseph Dunford, the head of the coalition military
forces in  Afghanistan .  The Afghan National Army has “one corps, five brigade
headquarters, and 27 battalions capable of operating
independently,” Dunford, the head of the  International Security
Assistance Force  in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services
Committee today in prepared testimony.  In December, a Pentagon  report  to Congress said one out of
23 Afghan National Army brigades was capable of operating
independently and none of the seven corps-level forces had the
capability.  President  Barack Obama  has said that a bulk of the 66,000
U.S. forces now in Afghanistan will return by the end of 2014,
after which a smaller number of troops may continue to train and
advise Afghan forces as well as carry out counterterrorism
operations. Although Obama hasn’t yet said how many troops will
remain in the country after 2014, the U.S. has indicated that
about 8,000 to 12,000 allied troops are likely to stay.  The Afghan army and police together number about 352,000
and NATO plans to maintain that size beyond 2016.  Even with the Afghan army’s increased independence, Dunford
said the country’s military faced several challenges. Attrition,
or troops leaving the military, was averaging about 5,000 a
month or about 2.7 percent, exceeding the target of about 1.4
percent, Dunford said. The military also faces shortages of non-
commissioned officers, he said.  As Afghan troops lead as many as 80 percent of the
continuing operations they’re also suffering casualties, mostly
from roadside bombs, because the army has fewer explosive
ordnance teams than required, Dunford said. The Army has 59 bomb
teams compared with an authorized 230, and the police force has
14 out of a required 88 teams, Dunford said. “This gap will
likely endure through 2015.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
