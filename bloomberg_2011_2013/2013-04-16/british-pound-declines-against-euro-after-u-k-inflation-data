The pound weakened against the euro
after a report showed U.K. consumer-price inflation stayed above
the  Bank of England â€™s 2 percent target last month. Gilts were
little changed.          Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to 85.43 pence per euro at
9:39 a.m. London time. It was little changed at $1.5277.  The yield on 10-year gilts was at 1.71 percent.  Consumer prices rose 2.8 percent from a year earlier, the
Office for National Statistics said in London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
