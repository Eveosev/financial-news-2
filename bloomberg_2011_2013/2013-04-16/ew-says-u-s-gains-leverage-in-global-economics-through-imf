Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
defended the U.S.’s role in the  International Monetary Fund 
after the Obama administration asked Congress to approve a plan
to boost the lender’s resources.  “We have a veto in the IMF, we have a controlling voice
when we need to,” Lew told the House Budget Committee today.
“We have leverage so that the United States can influence the
economic decisions around the world, and it’s something our
international leadership depends on.”  President  Barack Obama  on April 10 sent a 2014 budget
proposal to lawmakers that would make good on a 2 1/2-year-old
pledge that the administration made to the Washington-based IMF,
an organization of 188 member nations which lends to governments
facing a balance-of-payments or economic crisis. Obama asked to
increase the U.S. share, or quota, by shifting about $63 billion
from an existing credit line.  John Campbell , a California Republican, questioned Lew
during the hearing about whether spending money to fund the IMF
“is a good use of resources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
