Energy Future Holdings Corp., the
Texas power producer taken private in 2007 in the largest
leveraged buyout, sees earnings for its competitive power unit
tumbling by a third during the next five years as hedges against
natural gas prices expire.  The company formerly known as TXU Corp. predicts adjusted
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
for its Texas Competitive Electric Holdings unit will fall to
$1.83 billion in 2017 from $2.75 billion this year, according to
a  filing  yesterday. Energy Future released the projections to
creditors as part of confidential discussions for a proposed
pre-packaged bankruptcy.  As the natural gas contracts run out next year, the unit
holding the company’s Luminant power generation division risks
running afoul of an agreement limiting how much debt it can
hold, Andy DeVries, a New York-based analyst with CreditSights
Inc., said yesterday. It appears that Dallas-based Energy Future
is “going to restructure before the covenants trip” on $32
billion in debt, he said.  Texas’ largest electricity provider has struggled with debt
since it was taken over in a $48 billion deal in 2007 led by KKR
& Co., TPG Capital LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The buyout,
which left Energy Future with more than $40 billion in debt, was
a gamble that gas prices would rise and give its coal-fired
plants a competitive advantage. Instead, U.S. prices for the
fuel fell to a 10-year low last year.  Energy Future’s gas contracts mitigate the effect falling
prices have on electricity. The Texas Competitive unit said in
February that its hedges against fluctuating gas prices will
decrease to 41 percent of exposure by 2014, from 99 percent last
year.  Gas Prices  The 2013 hedges lock in gas at a weighted average price of
$6.89 per million British thermal units, a 67 percent gain from
the settlement price of $4.137 at yesterday in New York.  The hedging positions are expected to boost the unit’s
adjusted Ebitda by $1.02 billion this year and $577 million next
year, according to the company filing.  Energy Future sees wholesale power prices in its Texas
market increasing to $43.85 a megawatt-hour this year from
$34.28 as gas rises to $4.47 by 2017.  To contact the reporters on this story:
