Turk Hava Yollari AO (THYAO) , Turkey’s
flagship carrier, advanced to the highest level in a week on
speculation a drop in  oil prices  bodes well for its earnings.  Shares of Turkish Airlines, as the carrier is known, rose
1.7 percent to 7.18 liras at the close in Istanbul, gaining for
a second day.  Brent crude  traded 1.2 percent lower at $99.15 a
barrel, extending its loss in the past five days to 6.7 percent.  “The correlation between Turkish Airlines shares and oil
increases at times when there are abrupt changes in oil prices
such as this,” Ozgur Goker, an analyst at Yapi Kredi Yatirim in
Istanbul, said in a phone interview today. “Now that oil is
below $100, we see a positive impact on shares.”  Passenger traffic climbed by an annual 26 percent to 10
million in the first quarter,  Turkish Airlines  said in a
statement to Borsa Istanbul today. Load factor, a measure of
occupancy, rose 5.1 percentage points to 77.9 percent, it said.
Turk Hava on March 15 reported a net income of 1.13 billion
liras ($630 million) for 2012, beating the average estimate of
1.05 billion liras in a Bloomberg survey of 21 analysts.  The Bloomberg World Airlines Index rose 1.5 percent,
increasing for the first time in three days. The capitalization-
weighted gauge of the leading airlines stocks in the world lost
1.8 percent in the two days ended yesterday.  Goker has a hold recommendation on the stock, with a 12-
month price target of 7.7 liras. Sixteen analysts  recommend 
buying the shares, while nine say hold and one recommends
selling, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Turkish Airlines  trades  at 7.7 times its estimated 12-month
earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with a 5.5 multiple for Russia’s OAO Aeroflot, 9.1 for United
Arab Emirates’  Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI)  and 9.9 for Germany’s  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG. (LHA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
