A sustained slump in  gold prices 
threatens to shut mines and curb investment in Tanzania,
 Africa ’s fourth-largest producer of the metal, a senior official
in the Ministry of Energy and Minerals said.  “We are concerned that as the price of gold continues to
drop it will discourage future investment,” Ally Samaje, acting
mineral commissioner, said in an interview yesterday in the
commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. “If this continues, there
will be a point when companies can’t operate and mines will
close.”  Gold plunged 9.1 percent on April 15, the biggest drop
since 1983. The price has declined as the  U.S. economy 
strengthened and Federal Reserve policy makers signaled that
stimulus may be scaled back, denting demand for the metal as a
haven. Gold accounts for about 35 percent of Tanzania’s export
earnings and the government is seeking to quadruple the
contribution of mining over the next 12 years from 2.3 percent
of gross domestic product currently.  African Barrick Gold Plc (ABG) , the biggest producer of the metal
in Tanzania, operates four mines in the country, while  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  has one.  Resolute Mining Ltd. (RSG) , which owns the
Golden Pride Mine that opened in 1998, plans to end mining
operations there by June, according to its website.  “The falling of gold prices means that we will miss out on
significant revenue, not only general revenue but also corporate
taxes go down,” Samaje said. “We haven’t felt the impact yet
so we haven’t started to make noise.”  Mining Royalties  The government has amended rules in recent years to derive
more benefit from natural resources. It raised royalties on
minerals in 2010, including gold, to 4 percent from 3 percent
and gave the government shareholding rights in future mining
projects.  Tanzania has an estimated 40 trillion cubic feet of natural
gas reserves, mines the world’s only known Tanzanite deposit at
the foot of  Mount Kilimanjaro  and has nickel,  iron ore , coal,
diamond and tin reserves.  The value of Tanzania’s gold exports declined 8 percent to
$2.09 billion in the 12 months through February from $2.26
billion a year earlier, according to the central bank.  “Gold prices dropping are not only a concern to the
Ministry of Energy, they are a concern to the whole nation,”
Samaje said. “We will suffer if this decrease persists.”  Delayed Pinch  The price of gold, which rallied for the past 12 years in
the longest gain in at least nine decades, has lost 26 percent
since climbing to a record $1,921.15 an ounce in September 2011.
It rose as much as 1.6 percent to $1,390.10 an ounce by 10:35
a.m. in  New York  today.  Tanzania is concerned that gold mining companies will take
cost-cutting measures and trim output amid falling demand for
the precious metal, Samaje said.  “So far we haven’t experienced any impact from the drop of
gold prices,” he said. “We are still seeing exploration
activities and demand for investment. We have seen revenue on an
upward trend. We will see if this changes in the next quarter.
We haven’t yet felt the pinch.”  Tanzania’s currency gained for the first time in three
days, advancing less than 0.1 percent to 1,626 per dollar by
5:41 p.m. in the commercial capital,  Dar es Salaam , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
