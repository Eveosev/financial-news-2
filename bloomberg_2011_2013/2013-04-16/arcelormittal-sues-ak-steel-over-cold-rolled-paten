ArcelorMittal (MT)  USA LLC, part of the
world’s biggest steelmaker, sued a unit of  AK Steel Holding
Corp. (AKS)  for infringing a patent for automotive quality cold-rolled
sheet steel.  The U.S. arm of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal contends
West Chester, Ohio-based AK is wrongly using the high-tensile-
strength aluminum-boron technology for stamped auto parts,
according to a complaint filed today in federal court in
Wilmington, Delaware.  “ArcelorMittal has been damaged by such infringement and
will continue to be damaged by such infringement,” unless it’s
stopped by a court, according to the complaint, which seeks a
 jury trial , damages and court costs.  In a similar case filed in 2010, a judge in the same court
ruled that the patent was invalid and not infringed. An appeals
court last year sent the case back for review. Meanwhile, the
owner made changes to the old patent, had it reissued with a
different number and is using it in this case.  Barry L. Racey, an AK spokesman, didn’t immediately return
e-mail and voice-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit
after business hours.  The new case is ArcelorMittal v.  AK Steel , U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). The old case is
ArcelorMittal v. AK Steel, 10-cv-00050, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent in the new lawsuit, click: RE153. The
older patent: 6,296,805.  To contact the reporter on this story:
