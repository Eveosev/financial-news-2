The following is the text of
 Canada â€™s manufacturing shipments report for February released
by  Statistics Canada .  Manufacturing sales advanced 2.6% to $49.6 billion, the
largest increase since July 2011. The gain in February largely
stemmed from higher sales in the transportation equipment,
petroleum and coal product, food, and miscellaneous
manufacturing industries. In total, sales rose in 14 of 21
industries, representing approximately 85% of Canadian
manufacturing.  Constant dollar manufacturing sales increased 2.5%,
indicating that most of the gain reflected higher sales volumes.  Sales of durable goods were up 3.7% to $25.1 billion, while
non-durable goods sales rose 1.5% to $24.5 billion.  Sales gains led by transportation equipment  Sales in the transportation equipment industry rose 8.7% to
$8.1 billion, the largest gain in percentage terms since January
2011. The gain was mostly attributable to a 13.5% advance in the
motor vehicle assembly industry. A 15.5% increase in production
in the aerospace product and parts industry also contributed to
higher transportation equipment sales.  In the petroleum and coal product industry, sales increased
2.4% to $7.3 billion. A 6.5% rise in prices for the industry, as
recorded by the Industrial Product  Price Index , was behind the
gain.  Food sales rose 1.9% to $6.9 billion, the largest increase
since August 2011. Sales were up 10.9% in the miscellaneous
manufacturing industry.  Sales rise in eight provinces  Sales rose in eight provinces in February, led by Ontario,
 Quebec  and  New Brunswick .  In Ontario, sales increased 3.3% to $22.4 billion. A 12.4%
advance in the motor vehicle assembly industry accounted for
approximately 60% of the provincial gain. The  chemical industry 
(+4.2%) and the aerospace product and parts industry (+26.2%)
also posted increases in February.  Manufacturing sales in Quebec rose 3.1% in February to
$11.7 billion. In the aerospace product and parts industry,
production increased 16.1% to $791 million. Sales in the
petroleum and coal product and the chemical industries were also
behind the provincial gain.  Sales rose 18.0% to $1.9 billion in New Brunswick as a
result of gains in the non-durable goods industries.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, manufacturing activity
dropped 32.8% to $435 million. Sales were also down in  Nova
Scotia  (-2.6%).  Inventories rise  Manufacturing inventories rose 0.9% to $66.1 billion in
February, the highest level since January 2009.  In the primary metal industry, inventories increased 3.9%
to $7.9 billion. This was the fourth gain in five months.  Inventories in the aerospace product and parts industry
were up 2.3% to $5.1 billion, the highest level since August
2009.  The computer and electronic product (+3.4%) and the
petroleum and coal product (+1.9%) industries also posted higher
inventory levels in February.  The inventory-to-sales ratio declined to 1.33 in February
from 1.36 in January.  Growth in unfilled orders slows  Unfilled orders increased 0.4% to $69.6 billion in February,
the fourth consecutive monthly gain. However, the advance in
February was much smaller than the gains posted in each of the
three previous months.  In the aerospace product and parts industry, unfilled
orders rose 1.0% to $40.1 billion. The increase reflected a gain
in the value of the US dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. A
large proportion of aerospace unfilled orders are held in US
dollars. Excluding the aerospace industry, unfilled orders for
the rest of the manufacturing sector declined 0.5%.  A 19.1% decrease in unfilled orders in the  food industry 
offset a portion of the gains. Unfilled orders in the food
industry stood at $444 million in February.  New orders declined 4.0% to $49.9 billion. The decrease was
caused by a decline in new orders received in the aerospace
industry in February compared with January.  Note to readers  Monthly data in this release are seasonally adjusted and
are expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified.
Preliminary data are provided for the current reference month.
Revised data, based on late responses, are updated for the three
previous months.  Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and
tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing,
leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support
activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics
and rubber products.  Durable goods industries include wood products, non-
metallic mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal
products, machinery, computer and electronic products,
electrical equipment, appliances and components, transportation
equipment, furniture and related products and miscellaneous
manufacturing.  Production-based industries  For the  aerospace industry  and shipbuilding industries, the
value of production is used instead of sales of goods
manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting monthly
sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories
of goods in process and finished products manufactured.  Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute
to future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled.  New orders are those received whether sold in the current
month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for
the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the
previous month to the current month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
