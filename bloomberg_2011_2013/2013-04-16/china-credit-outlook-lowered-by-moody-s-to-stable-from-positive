Moody’s Investors Service lowered
its outlook for  China ’s credit rating to stable from positive,
saying the nation has made less progress than anticipated in
reducing risks from local-government debt and credit expansion.  The scope and pace of “structural reforms under the new
leadership” may not be sufficient over the next 12 to 18 months
to justify an upgrade of China’s Aa3 rating, Moody’s said today
in a statement from  Singapore  as it affirmed the rating.  The comments add to concerns that risks are building up
that may harm growth in the world’s second-largest economy after
 expansion  unexpectedly slowed to 7.7 percent in the first
quarter. Fitch Ratings Ltd. last week cut its long-term local-
currency debt rating on the country, citing dangers to financial
stability.  “Effective macro-prudential regulation of the financial
system and the advancement of a broad range of reforms will
likely be necessary to prevent the build-up of imbalances which
could increase the risks of a hard landing for the economy,”
Moody’s said.  --Scott Lanman. Editors: Scott Lanman,  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
