Japanese individual investors
doubled gold purchases today at Tokuriki Honten Co., the
nation’s second-largest retailer of the precious metal, the
company said.  Purchases doubled as the price of bullion in Tokuriki
Honten’s more than 100 retail outlets dropped 6.8 percent to
4,477 yen ($46) a gram from 4,802 yen yesterday, including a 5
percent sales tax, Masahiro Arai, general manager at the
precious metals department of the Tokyo-based company, said in
an interview. He didn’t disclose the volume of sales.  “Gold demand from retail investors was surprisingly
strong, regardless of the tumble in the international market,”
said Arai, who has worked in the gold market for 28 years.
“They are anticipating a recovery in yen-based  gold prices , as
the currency is expected to depreciate because of the  Bank of
Japan (8301) ’s monetary easing.”  Tokuriki’s price for retail investors climbed to 5,338 yen
a gram on April 10, the highest since 1980, as the yen slid to
99.88 per dollar, the weakest since April 2009. The Bank of
 Japan  has said it will take unprecedented monetary easing to
lift the world’s third-largest economy out of deflation.  Gold for immediate delivery gained 2.1 percent to $1,377.75
an ounce at 4:22 p.m. in Tokyo after posting the biggest decline
since 1983 yesterday, deepening a  bear market . Bullion has lost
18 percent in 2013, after rising for 12 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
