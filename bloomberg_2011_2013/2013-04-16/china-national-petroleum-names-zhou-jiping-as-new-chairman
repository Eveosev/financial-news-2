China National Petroleum Corp., the
country’s largest oil producer, promoted Zhou Jiping to
chairman, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.  Zhou, 61, most recently served as the company’s vice
chairman and president and had taken on the duties of chairman
since Jiang Jiemin became head of the State-owned Assets
Supervision & Administration Commission. The commission known as
SASAC oversees 115 of China’s biggest state-owned companies from
CNPC to China Mobile Ltd.  Zhou has nearly 40 years of experience in China’s
petrochemical industry, according to the  website  of PetroChina
Co., the listed unit of CNPC. He previously worked in the
International Exploration and Development Cooperation Bureau of
CNPC and at the subsidiary China National Oil & Gas Exploration
& Development Corp.  Calls to spokesmen for CNPC and PetroChina went unanswered
today.  PetroChina  fell  1.9 percent to HK$9.49 at the close in Hong
Kong. Xinhua reported Zhou’s appointment after the close of
regular trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
