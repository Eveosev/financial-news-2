Mineros SA (MINEROS) , a Colombian mining
company, fell the most on the country’s benchmark stock index
after prices for the precious metal had their biggest plunge in
33 years.  The shares lost 4.44 percent, to 4,300 pesos at the close
in Bogota, the biggest drop since July. The stock was the worst
performer on the  IGBC index , which rose 1.1 percent.  While shares of Mineros, based in Medellin, don’t change
hands every day in Bogota, the stock hasn’t posted a daily gain
in a trading session for  more than a month . Corp. Financiera
Colombia SA, a Colombian financial company that is Mineros’s
 second-biggest shareholder  according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, said April 10 that it plans to sell the stake.  “The price of gold is falling, and at the same time the
market believes that there’s an important block of selling,”
said Mauricio Restrepo, an analyst at Bolsa y Renta in Medellin.  Gold futures for June delivery plummeted 9.3 percent
yesterday in  New York , the biggest drop since 1980 for a most-
active contract. Gold rose 1.4 percent today to $1,366.35 an
ounce at 4:19 p.m. in New York.  Last month Mineros agreed to buy 90% of Nicaraguan gold
producer Hemco in a leveraged acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
