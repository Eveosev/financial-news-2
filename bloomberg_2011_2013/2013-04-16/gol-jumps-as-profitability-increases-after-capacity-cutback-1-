Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
Brazil’s second-biggest air carrier by market share, rallied
after announcing that a measure of profitability increased as
the company reduced capacity to boost net income.  The shares climbed 6.5 percent to 12.07 reais at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo, the most since December 26. It was the
third-best performer on the benchmark  Bovespa index , which added
2 percent.  A gauge of profitability that measures net passenger income
per available seat per kilometer increased 16 percent in March
from a year earlier, Gol said in a statement after the close of
trading yesterday. The company attributed the increase to its
strategy of cutting flights in markets where there is less
demand. It reduced domestic flights by 9.8 percent, according to
the filing.  “March statistics show another very impressive unit
revenue increase,” Stephen Trent, an analyst at Citigroup Inc,
wrote in a note to clients today.  Gol is reducing domestic capacity by 7 percent in 2013 as
it tries to improve margins after economic growth came in lower
than forecast last year. The airline had projected  Brazil ’s
gross domestic product would grow 3 percent to 4 percent, more
than three times the 0.9 percent advance.  Gol is also conducting an initial public offering of its
frequent-flier unit, Smiles SA, to raise cash and trim debt.  The carrier’s shares declined 6.4 percent this year while
the Bovespa fell 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
