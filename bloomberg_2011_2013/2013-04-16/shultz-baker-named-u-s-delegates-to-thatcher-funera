President  Barack Obama  named former
secretaries of state George Shultz and James A. Baker to lead
the U.S. delegation attending the funeral of former British

was the chief U.S. diplomat under President Ronald Reagan,
Thatcher’s Cold-War ally. Baker served under President George
H.W. Bush, who succeeded Reagan in office.  Also included in the delegation are Barbara Stephenson,
charge d’affaires to the United Kingdom and Louis Susman, former
U.S. ambassador to the U.K.  More than 2,000 invitations are being sent for the funeral

state funeral for Winston Churchill in 1965. Queen Elizabeth II
will lead the mourners.  Other guests expected to attend the funeral include  Newt Gingrich , former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives
