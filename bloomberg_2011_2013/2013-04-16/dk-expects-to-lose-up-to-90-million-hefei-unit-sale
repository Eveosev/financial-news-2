LDK Solar Co. (LDK) ’s Anhui LDK New
Energy Co. agreed to sell its stake in LDK Solar High-Tech
(Hefei) Co. to an affiliate of the municipal government of
Hefei, in  China ’s Anhui province.  LDK Solar agreed to sell the unit for 120 million  yuan 
($19.4 million) and expects to realize a net loss of $80 million
to $90 million on the sale, the Xinyu, China-based company said
in a statement today. Solar High-Tech produces solar cells and
panels.  “We appreciate the assistance and collaboration from Hefei
Municipal Government,” Tong Xingxue, President and Chief
Executive Officer of LDK, said in the statement.  LDK, the world’s second-biggest maker of wafers that
convert sunlight into power, is selling the unit as it struggles
to pay down more than $3.1 billion in debt. It failed to make a
bond payment yesterday and has a $240 million loan that will be
due in June.  LDK said Jan. 2 that it had signed an agreement with
Shanghai-based Shanghai Qianjiang Group to purchase all of LDK’s
shares of LDK Anhui. Qianjiang failed to get government approval
by the agreement’s expiration date of March 30, LDK said in
today’s statement.  The company also said today that it reached an agreement to
delay repayment to two holders controlling $16.6 million of its
$23.8 million in bonds due yesterday. The company, which had net
debt of $3.1 billion at the end of September, is expected to
report a loss when it reports fourth-quarter results this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
