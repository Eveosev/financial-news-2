Kevin Pietersen  will miss the
England cricket team’s Test series against  New Zealand  next
month as he continues to recover from a knee injury.  Pietersen, 32, suffered a bone bruise to his right knee
last month during England’s series in New Zealand which forced
him to miss the final Test. He’ll have a scan next week to
determine when he’ll be able to start training again, the
England and Wales Cricket Board said in a statement.  England and New Zealand open their two-match Test series
May 16 at Lord’s in London. The second Test will begin May 24 at
Headingley in Leeds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
