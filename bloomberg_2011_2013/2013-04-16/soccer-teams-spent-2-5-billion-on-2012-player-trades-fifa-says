Spending in soccer’s global player
transfer market fell 10 percent in 2012 to $2.53 billion,
according to the sport’s governing body FIFA.  The Zurich-based organization said its Transfer Matching
System registered 11,552 cross-border trades in 2012, 1 percent
more than the previous year. Sales between clubs in the same
country are registered locally and aren’t included in  FIFA  data.  The report showed that clubs paid fees to recruit players
from other teams only in 14 percent of cases, while 70 percent
involved out-of-contract players. The remainder was made up of
loan agreements.  FIFA didn’t say why spending was down on a year earlier,
though some of the reduction may involve European teams,
soccer’s biggest spenders, trimming outgoing costs in
preparation to meet new break-even regulations.  English teams accounted for the biggest spending in 2012,
shelling out $314 million on players such as Eden Hazard and
Oscar, attackers who joined Chelsea for more than a combined 50
million pounds ($77 million). Russia was the next highest with
$256 million spent. Brazil was the highest net recipient, taking
in $121 million, $18 million more than teams in  Portugal , the
next-highest earner.  FIFA established its compulsory online player trading
system in October 2010, as an attempt to bring order to an
industry where billions of dollars moved annually with in many
cases little oversight.  Payments to Agents  “Players, club decision makers, association
representatives, intermediaries, and all other football
stakeholders can now benchmark their activities in relation to
the transfer market,” FIFA said.  Player trades often include payments to middlemen and
agents. FIFA said the $59 million paid by English teams to
intermediaries was more than that paid in any other country.
Payments to middlemen worldwide were up 19 percent.  Italy paid the highest average wages to incoming players,
with those moving there getting an average $720,000, FIFA said.  The report also showed  Brazil , host of next year’s World
Cup, was again the most represented nation. Brazilian clubs were
involved in 11 percent of all transfers, the report said, with
696 players moving to the country and 612 leaving.  To contact the reporter on this story:
