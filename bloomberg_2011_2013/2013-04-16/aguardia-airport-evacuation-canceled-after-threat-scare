The central terminal at New York’s
LaGuardia Airport was evacuated this morning after a report of a
suspicious package that turned out to be part of a lighting
system, the  Port Authority  of New York and  New Jersey  said.  The Central Terminal Building, which serves most domestic
airlines at the airport in Queens, was evacuated at about 10:30
a.m. after a report of a suspicious package, said Steve Coleman,
a spokesman for the Port Authority, in an e-mail.  The package turned out to be a so-called light ballast, and
an all-clear was given less than an hour later, Ron Marsico, a
Port Authority spokesman said in an e-mail. The event followed
yesterday’s bombing of the Boston Marathon, which killed three
people.  To contact the reporters on this story:
