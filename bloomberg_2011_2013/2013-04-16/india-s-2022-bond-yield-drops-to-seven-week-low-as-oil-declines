India ’s bonds due 2022 advanced,
pushing the yield to a seven-week low, on optimism falling  oil
prices  will help ease inflation and give the central bank more
room to cut  interest rates .  Brent crude  traded below $100 a barrel today for the first
time since July and has lost 11 percent this year. India imports
about 80 percent of the oil it uses. The pace of wholesale- price 
gains fell to a 40-month low of 5.96 percent in March, official
data showed yesterday. Annual expansion in factory output slowed
to 0.6 percent in February from 2.4 percent the previous month,
government data showed last week.  “If global commodity prices sustain their recent fall,
then the trend in both headline and core wholesale inflation
will be lower,” Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts including Mumbai-
based Sonal Varma wrote in a research note. “With growth weak
and inflation lower, we believe that a cut is more likely than
not, but it is not a done deal.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.81 percent as of
10:15 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That is the lowest level since Feb. 27.  Nomura sees an 80 percent probability that the  Reserve Bank 
of India will reduce its 7.5 percent  repurchase  rate by 25 basis
points at the next review on May 3. The RBI lowered the measure
by 25 basis points each in January and March.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.33 percent, the lowest level since March 15, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
