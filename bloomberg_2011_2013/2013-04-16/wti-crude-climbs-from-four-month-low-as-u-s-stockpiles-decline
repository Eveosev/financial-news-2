West Texas Intermediate fell for
the fourth time in five days, trading near the lowest level in
almost four months before government data forecast to show U.S.
crude inventories rose last week.  WTI dropped as much as 1.7 percent. An Energy Department
report today may show crude supplies rose 1.2 million barrels to
the highest level in 22 years, according to a Bloomberg survey.
That’s contrary to a report yesterday from the  American
Petroleum Institute , which showed stockpiles slid 6.7 million
barrels last week, the most since the seven days ended Dec. 28.  “The oil market is looking quite weak and there’s a
comfortable supply-demand situation in the short term,” said
Gerrit Zambo, an oil trader at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich,
who predicts the European benchmark, Brent, may tumble to $80 a
barrel in the first half. “The fundamental reason for the
bearish situation is the cautious outlook worldwide.”  WTI for May delivery declined as much as $1.50 to $87.22 a
barrel, and was at $87.27 in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 1:03 p.m. London time. The volume of all
futures traded was 47 percent above the 100-day average. The
contract closed at $88.71 on April 15, the lowest since Dec. 24.
Prices are down 4.8 percent this year.  Brent for June settlement slipped $1.15 cents to $98.76 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract fell to $99.91 yesterday, the lowest close since July
10. The front-month contract’s premium to WTI shrank to as
little as $10.53, the narrowest since April 12.  Bollinger Band  WTI settled below the 30-day lower Bollinger Band for a
second day yesterday, signaling the market is oversold,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. WTI also rebounded in
early March after dropping below this band. The indicator, at
around $88.63 today, presents technical support, a level where
buy orders may be clustered.  BNP Paribas SA cut its 2013 forecasts for Brent and WTI to
reflect the price drop in the first quarter. The bank trimmed
its Brent estimate to $108 a barrel from $115 and WTI to $95
from $100. Prices will recover in the second half, supported by
“loose” global monetary policy and political threats to
supply,  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity markets
strategy, said in an e-mailed report.  Buying Opportunity  Crude’s weakness is temporary and investors should treat
this week’s decline as a buying opportunity, while users should
take advantage of the drop to hedge at least part of their
requirements,  Michael Wittner , the head of oil-market research
at Societe Generale SA in  New York , said in a report e-mailed
today. He reiterated his forecast for Brent to trade at $112 to
$113 a barrel in the second half of 2013.  “Brent below $100 a barrel is something you can consider
buying,” said Dominic Schnider, head of commodities research at
UBS AG’s wealth-management unit in  Singapore . “We expect demand
to pick up over the second half of 2013. There’s great value for
Brent at $90-$95, and a strong buy at these levels.”  U.S. gasoline supplies rose 253,000 barrels last week, the
industry-funded API said. They are forecast to slip 800,000
barrels in the Energy Information Administration report due at
10:30 a.m. Washington time, according to the median estimate of
11 analysts in the Bloomberg News survey.  Distillate inventories, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, climbed 1.3 million barrels in the API data.
They are projected to drop 350,000 barrels in the EIA report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
