Copper rose in London after a
plunge to the lowest level in almost 18 months drew purchases
from  China , the world’s biggest consumer of the metal.  Chinese buying began April 12 as buyers capitalized on
slumping prices, according to Newedge Group SA. Copper’s 14-day
relative strength yesterday approached 31, nearing the level of
30 that indicates a potential impending rebound to some analysts
who study technical charts. Copper in London has traded  lower 
than metal in the  Shanghai  market since April 12.  “There is scope for upward movement,”  Gayle Berry , an
analyst at Barclays Plc in London, said by phone today. “Prices
have fallen quite a long way. Whenever you get big price moves,
that tends to spark some Chinese buying interest.”  Copper for delivery in three months climbed 1.1 percent to
$7,282 a metric ton by 10:42 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices yesterday touched $7,085, the lowest since Oct. 21, 2011.
Copper for delivery in May added 0.5 percent to $3.2885 a pound
on the Comex in  New York .  LME prices below those in Shanghai give Chinese buyers more
incentive to purchase metal in London and sell it at home.  Copper also advanced in  London  after Rio Tinto Group, the
world’s second-biggest mining company, said full-year production
of refined metal is set to fall by about 100,000 tons after a
wall slide last week at the  Bingham Canyon  mine in the U.S. Ore
production at the site remains suspended, the London-based
company said today in a statement.  Figures today will show builders in the U.S. broke ground
on new houses at a 930,000 annualized pace in March, the second-
strongest rate in more than four years, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists. The Copper Development Association says
construction generates about 40 percent of demand for the metal
used in pipes and wiring.  Copper  stockpiles  tracked by the LME, up 91 percent this
year to the highest since September 2003, gained 0.1 percent to
611,925 tons on deliveries in  New Orleans  and  Malaysia ’s Johor,
daily exchange figures showed. Orders to remove the metal from
warehouses fell 0.8 percent to 155,375 tons.  Aluminum, tin, zinc, lead and nickel rose in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
