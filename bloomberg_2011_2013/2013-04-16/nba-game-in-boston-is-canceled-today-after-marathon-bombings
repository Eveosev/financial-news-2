The  National Basketball Association  canceled today’s game in Boston between the Celtics and  Indiana Pacers  after yesterday’s  Boston Marathon bombings .  The NBA and the Celtics said in e-mailed releases that the game at TD Garden will not be rescheduled. The Celtics and Pacers already have locked in their playoff spots.  “Our sincere sympathies go out to all those affected by this senseless tragedy,” the Celtics said on their website. “The entire Celtics organization would like to acknowledge the heroic efforts of the brave civilian, police, fire and medical personnel responding in the City of Boston.”  At least three people were killed yesterday and at least 128 were hospitalized by explosions near the Boston Marathon’s finish line that authorities said were an act of terror.  The Celtics said they would have more information later today on their website for any fans who had tickets for tonight’s game against the Pacers.  Boston and Indiana have one game left each in the regular season after today. The Celtics are locked into the seventh playoff seed in the Eastern Conference and play the  New York  Knicks in the first round of the NBA playoffs, while the Pacers, the third seed in the East, are set to face the  Chicago Bulls  to open the postseason.
