Chile’s peso climbed for the first
time in six days as evidence of U.S. economic growth spurred
demand for higher-yielding assets in  emerging markets .  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 471.30 per U.S.
dollar at 10:37 a.m. in Santiago. The peso posted a 0.4 percent
decline yesterday, the biggest drop since December, after China
reported that economic growth unexpectedly slowed to 7.7 percent
in the first quarter.  “Markets look much calmer today than yesterday so that
spurs demand for the peso,” Francisca Roa, an analyst at
foreign-exchange consultancy firm Netgociando SA, said by phone
from Santiago.  New-home construction in the U.S. climbed 7 percent in
March to a 1.04 million annual rate, the most since June 2008,
the Commerce Department reported today in  Washington .  Chile’s currency rallied to 467.05 per dollar on April 8,
its strongest level since September 2011, spurring speculation
the central bank might intervene in the foreign-exchange market
to stem its gains. Policy makers refrained from mentioning
intervention in their statement published April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
