Traders who made record bets on
securities that track U.S.  stock volatility  scored the biggest
gains in almost two months yesterday as equities plunged.  The  iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures  exchange-traded
note climbed 12 percent to $20.52 and the  ProShares Ultra VIX
Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY)  soared 23 percent to $7.75, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Both increases were the biggest
since Feb. 25. The rallies came as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index slumped 2.3 percent to 1,552.36 and the Chicago Board
Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX)  increased 43 percent.  Traders have been piling into the notes to speculate on
losses in equities and protect profits after almost $2 trillion
was added to the value of American shares this year. Gains have
been hard to come by. The iPath note tied to the volatility
gauge known as the VIX fell for five straight days before
yesterday and the ProShares fund lost almost 70 percent in 2013,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Today is the reason why you hold VIX,” Mark Mandell, who
owns the iPath note as a  fund manager  for U.S. equity long-short
strategies at Dalton Investments, said in a phone interview. The
 Santa Monica , California-based firm oversees over $2 billion.
“There are macro concerns which have given us reason to own a
position in long volatility.”  The  S&P 500  plunged yesterday after  China’s economy 
expanded at a slower rate than forecast and gold declined the
most since 1980. Losses were led by energy and  commodity 
companies, which retreated 3.9 percent. The VIX advance was the
biggest since August 2011.  Volatility Securities  The iPath note fell 7.9 percent to $18.90 today, while
ProShares security slipped 18 percent to $6.39 as the benchmark
U.S volatility gauge retreated 19 percent to 13.96.  Outstanding shares of the volatility  securities  more than
doubled in 2013, reaching the highest levels ever, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Since 2010, the S&P 500 has dropped
an average 5.2 percent in the second quarter.  The VIX, which moves in the opposite direction of the  S&P
500 (SPXL1)  about 80 percent of the time, has declined as share prices
surged after the  Federal Reserve ’s unprecedented bond purchases
and three straight years of profit growth. The S&P 500 rallied
8.9 percent this year and has more than doubled from its 12-year
low in March 2009.  Re-Emerging Volatility  “In our 2013 outlook, we saw equities rallying to 2007
highs into about mid-year,” Peter Cecchini, global head of
institutional equity derivatives at New York-based Cantor
Fitzgerald LP, said in an interview. “Because we’ve run so far
so fast, we expect volatility may re-emerge a bit sooner.”  The S&P 500 rallied 12 percent in the first  quarter  of last
year and slipped 3.3 percent in the second. The previous year,
the index gained 5.4 percent in the first three months and lost
0.4 percent in the second quarter. The 12 percent slump in the
 S&P 500 (SPX)  between April 2010 and June 2010 followed a 4.9 percent
increase in the first quarter.  Equity hedge funds have trailed returns in U.S. stocks amid
skepticism about the rally’s sustainability. The HFRX Equity
Hedge Index of hedge-fund performance  rose  5 percent this year,
less than the gain for the S&P 500, according to Hedge Fund
Research Inc.  A gauge of hedge-fund bullishness, which measures how much
they’re betting on rising shares, rose to 51.6 last week from
50.8 on April 3, according to a survey by Washington-based ISI.
The high was 62 in May 2007. The ratio of bullish to bearish
bets rose above 50 in January for the first time since July
2011. A reading above 50 suggests a bias toward long bets
relative to normal positioning.  New Highs  The S&P 500 will climb to new highs as individual investors
add money back to mutual funds, according to Randall Warren of
Warren Financial Service in Exton,  Pennsylvania . While about
$18.4 billion was sent to U.S. stock mutual funds in January,
the deposits shrunk to $1.1 billion for February and March,
according to the  Investment Company Institute .  “Investors should be in this market,” Warren, who
oversees about $80 million including options as chief investment
officer of Warren Financial Service, said April 12 by phone.
“The market is showing incredible resilience and it will likely
keep going up.”  Strategists from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Morgan Stanley
and Deutsche Bank AG have increased their S&P 500 forecasts for
the year.  Garry Evans  of HSBC Holdings Plc raised his estimate
on April 9, predicting the index may rise to 1,680 by the end of
2013.  Less Optimism  Individual investors are less optimistic. Expectations that
stock prices will fall over the next six months increased 26
percentage points to 54.5 percent last week, the highest level
of bearishness since July 2010, according to a survey released
last week from the  American Association of Individual Investors .  Payrolls grew by 88,000 in March, the smallest gain in nine
months and less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg survey, Labor Department data showed April 5. Retail
sales fell 0.4 percent last month, according to the Commerce
Department, and the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary index of consumer sentiment declined to 72.3 in
April from 78.6 a month earlier.  Wagers that U.S. stock volatility will rebound have reached
a three-year high. The number of VIX  calls  outstanding rose to
7.31 million on April 9, more than three times the number of
puts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
highest ratio of calls-to-puts since February 2010.  All five  most-owned  VIX contracts were calls. April 20
calls, with an exercise level 16 percent above the last close,
and April 18 calls has the largest open interest.  “Hedging is cheap,” Brian Bier, head of equity
derivatives sales and trading at Macro Risk Advisors LLC, said
in an April 12 telephone interview in  New York . “More people
are taking advantage of the cheap volatility to express
directional views to the upside in the VIX.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
