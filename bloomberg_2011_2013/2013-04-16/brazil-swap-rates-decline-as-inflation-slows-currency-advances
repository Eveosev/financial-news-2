Brazil ’s swap rates fell for the
first time in seven days as an index indicated that inflation
unexpectedly slowed, damping speculation that the central bank
will raise borrowing costs tomorrow.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2014 dropped four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.17 percent at 10:15
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real appreciated 0.8 percent to 1.9860
per dollar after declining 1.6 percent yesterday, the biggest
drop since November.  The Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today that
wholesale, construction and consumer prices as measured by the
IGP-10 inflation  index  climbed 0.18 percent in the month through
April 10, slower than the increase of 0.22 percent in the prior
period and the 0.35 percent median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The IGP number helps the expectation that monetary
tightening may not be so significant,” Flavio Serrano, a senior
economist at Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento SA in Sao
Paulo, said in a telephone interview.  The real tumbled yesterday to a level weaker than 2 per
dollar as regulators postponed the initial public offering of
Banco do Brasil SA’s insurance unit, diminishing the prospects
for investment in the nation’s assets.  The central bank, which begins a two-day monetary policy
meeting today, has maintained the target lending  rate  at a
record low 7.25 percent since October to avoid jeopardizing the
recovery without further fueling inflation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
