Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , the world’s
biggest maker of health-care products, reported first-quarter
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates as  new drugs  and the
acquisition of Synthes Inc. boosted sales.  Earnings excluding one-time items were $1.44 a share,
topping by 5 cents the average of 11 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Net income declined 11 percent to $3.5
billion, or $1.22 a share, from $3.91 billion, or $1.41, a year
earlier,  New Brunswick , New Jersey-based J&J said today in a
statement. The company reiterated its full-year forecast.  J&J is focusing on increasing sales of newly approved
medicines, including the prostate cancer drug Zytiga and stroke
prevention treatment Xarelto, to help overcome lost revenue from
generic competition. Investors are watching to see results for
J&J’s newest therapy, the diabetes treatment Invokana.  “The pharma business is really what outperformed in the
quarter,” said  Jeff Jonas , co-portfolio manager at Gabelli
Healthcare and Wellness, in a telephone interview. “We are
seeing really good uptake for a lot of their new medicines.”  Sales rose to $17.5 billion from $16.1 billion. The company
reaffirmed its 2013 forecast of  earnings  excluding one-time
items of $5.35 to $5.45 a share.  “One thing that was a positive surprise was that they
could maintain their guidance, the street was expecting a cut
mostly on foreign exchange,” Jonas said. “That was a real
positive that they could maintain it.”  Unit Sales  J&J gained 2.1 percent to $83.44 at the close in New York.
The  shares  have increased 30 percent in the past 12 months.  Sales of  consumer goods  and over-the-counter products, led
by Tylenol and Motrin, rose 2.2 percent to $3.7 billion as the
company started to return dozens of recalled products to U.S.
store shelves.  Prescription medicines sales climbed 10 percent to $6.8
billion, led by a 57 percent increase in sales of psoriasis
treatment Stelara to $346 million and a 72 percent jump in
Zytiga sales to $344 billion.  At J&J’s medical device and diagnostics division, revenue
rose 10 percent to $7.06 billion. The purchase last year of
device maker Synthes boosted earnings in the device division by
14 percent worldwide, the company said. A sale of the $2.2
billion Ortho Clinical Diagnostics unit is being weighed, the
company said in January.  Net income in the quarter was reduced by about $600 million
from litigation expenses and costs from the acquisition of
Synthes. The company is fighting more than 10,000 lawsuits over
its recalled hip implants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
