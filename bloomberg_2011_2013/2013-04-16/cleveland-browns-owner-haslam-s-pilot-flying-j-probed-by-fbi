Cleveland Browns football team
owner Jimmy Haslam’s truck stop-service business, Pilot Flying J
Inc., was searched by agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation and  Internal Revenue Service , an FBI agent said.  Marshall Stone, supervising special agent of the FBI’s
office in Knoxville,  Tennessee , where the company is based,
confirmed the search was under way in a telephone interview
yesterday. Stone declined to say what the agents were searching
for.  “The FBI secured our headquarters today and informed us
they are investigating Pilot/Flying J,” Haslam said in a
statement yesterday. “We will cooperate appropriately with any
and all external investigations and conduct our own. I believe
and trust there has been no wrongdoing. The integrity of our
company always has been job # 1.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
