President Narayana Kocherlakota said it’s too soon to say a
plunge in gold prices stemmed from greater investor confidence
in the U.S. economy.  “Confidence is a key missing variable in the economy right
now,” Kocherlakota said today in response to audience questions
after a speech in Minneapolis. “I hope we can tell a story,
going down the road, where we look back and say, ‘Boy that
decline in gold prices was a sign that people have more
confidence in the economy.’ I am not willing to do that based on
a one-day fall no matter how sharp.”  Gold prices slumped 14 percent in the two days through
yesterday, the most since February 1983. The metal, which
rallied for the past 12 years in the longest gain in at least
nine decades, has lost 28 percent since climbing to a record
$1,921.15 an ounce in September 2011.  Kocherlakota also said  the Fed  doesn’t target asset prices,
but has sought to lower interest rates as a way to fuel growth
and increase employment. Current valuations of equities seem to
be within historical ranges and don’t suggest “evidence of
bubbliness or frothiness” in prices, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
