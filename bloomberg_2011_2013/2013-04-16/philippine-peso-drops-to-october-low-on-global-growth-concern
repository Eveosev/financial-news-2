The Philippine peso fell to the
lowest level in almost six months as slowing Chinese economic
growth fanned concern the global recovery is stalling, damping
demand for emerging-market assets.  Government bonds  gained.  The world’s second-biggest economy expanded 7.7 percent in
the first quarter, less than 7.9 percent in the preceding three
months and the 8 percent estimated by economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Philippine exports fell 15.6 percent in February from a
year earlier, the biggest drop since 2011, data showed last week.
The peso’s weak bias will stay for the near term after the
overseas sales figures, ING Groep NV said in a research note
yesterday.  “ China ’s slowdown would have more of a second-round effect,
rather than a primary, direct impact,” said  Sacha Tihanyi , a
senior foreign-exchange strategist at Scotiabank in  Hong Kong .
“Chinese growth data reflects a momentum slowdown, but I view
it as a little bit welcome as we don’t want to see another
overheating.”  The peso declined 0.4 percent to 41.397 per dollar as of
11:09 a.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It
touched 41.412 earlier, the weakest level since Oct. 22. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 4.78 percent.  Remittances, money sent home by Filipinos working overseas,
rose 6 percent to $1.68 billion in February from a year earlier,
below the 7.4 percent increase forecast by economists in a
Bloomberg survey, according to a central bank report yesterday.  The yield on the government’s 3.875 percent bonds due
November 2019 dropped three basis points to 2.88 percent, prices
from Tradition Financial Services show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
