Several U.S. Supreme Court justices
sought a compromise on the decades-old practice of granting
patents on human genes, debating a case that could redefine
rights throughout the biotechnology and agriculture industries.  Hearing arguments yesterday in  Washington , the justices
discussed chocolate-chip cookie recipes, baseball bats and
Amazonian plants as they grappled with a challenge to  Myriad
Genetics Inc. (MYGN) ’s patents on genes linked to breast and ovarian
cancer. A group of doctors, patients and scientists say the
patents are stifling clinical testing and research.  Several justices asked whether barring gene patents would
deter innovation by stripping companies of legal protection for
their research.  The case has implications for the growing field of
personalized medicine as well as efforts to map the human brain
and discover new uses for embryonic stem cells. It could also
ripple well beyond medicine. Agricultural companies, including
 Monsanto Co. (MON) , inject genes into seeds, and industrial
microbiology businesses use microorganism DNA to improve biofuel
manufacturing.  The Obama administration says Myriad isn’t entitled to a
patent on “isolated DNA,” which the government says is merely
a snippet of the genetic sequence as it appears in the body. The
administration says Myriad might be entitled to a patent on so-
called complementary DNA, which involves a greater level of
human manipulation.  The administration’s  stance  marks a rejection of the
longstanding policy of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,
which has been awarding human gene patents since 1982.  The case, which the court will decide by the end of June,
is splitting the medical community. Trade groups for the
biotechnology, agriculture and drug industries are siding with
Myriad. They say gene patents have led to valuable treatments,
including Amgen Inc.’s Epogen anemia drug and synthetic insulin
developed by Genentech Inc., now part of  Roche Holding AG. (ROG)   The case is Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad
Genetics, 12-398, U.S. Supreme Court (Washington).  For more on the arguments, click here.  Monetization Entities Filing Most Patent Cases, Study Finds  A study released last week shows that a majority of cases
challenging patents are initiated by patent monetization
entities, or so-called patent trolls.  The study , by Sara Jeruss of Lex Machina Inc. Robin
Feldman, a professor at the University of California Hastings
College of the Law, and Thomas Ewing, found that as of last
year, “litigation by patent monetization entities now
represents a majority of patent litigations filed in the U.S.”
In contrast, the authors said, in 2007 only 24 percent of
litigation was filed by the such entities.  The study also concluded that the process for notifying the
public of lawsuits involving patents is inadequate.  “Despite federal legislation, the system was not operative
for more than two-thirds of the patents asserted,” the authors
said.  For more patent news, click here.  Trademark  Macy’s Appeals Ruling on J.C. Penney’s Martha Stewart Sales  Macy’s Inc. is appealing a New York judge’s ruling that
allows  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  to sell unbranded items designed by
Martha Stewart’s company in certain categories exclusive to
Macy’s.  Justice Jeffrey Oing of New York state court in  Manhattan 
on April 12 declined to expand an earlier preliminary injunction
to cover products designed by  Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc. (MSO)  and sold at J.C. Penney that aren’t branded with the
Stewart name.  Macy’s said in a court filing yesterday that it met the
requirements for an injunction and that Oing “erred in several
significant respects.”  Macy’s is suing both Martha Stewart Living and J.C. Penney,
alleging that sales of products designed by Stewart’s company in
J.C. Penney stores violates an exclusivity deal between Martha
Stewart and Macy’s signed in 2006. Macy’s had asked Oing to
broaden the preliminary injunction he issued in July.  Macy’s wanted Oing to extend the injunction to cover goods
designed by Stewart’s New York-based company that don’t carry
her name, which Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney plans to sell
under the name “JCP Everyday.”  Lawyers for J.C. Penney and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on
yesterday’s filing.  The cases are  Macy’s Inc. (M)  v. Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia Inc., 650197/2012; Macy’s Inc. v. J.C. Penney Corp.,
652861/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  Web Domains Added Over Qualms of Companies, Governments  Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, the non-
profit organization that manages the Internet’s address system
under a contract with the U.S. Commerce Department, each week
unveils a batch of new domains.  Each new suffix creates millions of possible addresses to
be sold by registries. There are 106 million variations in .com
alone, according to  Verisign Inc. (VRSN) , the Reston, Virginia-based
global registry for .com and other domains.  The non-profit, known as Icann, is charging $185,000 for
rights to a new right-of-the-dot name, and expanding the Web
over qualms from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and brand-
name companies including Coca-Cola Co., Ford Motor Co., Procter
& Gamble Co., General Electric Co. and Johnson & Johnson.  At Icann’s meeting last week in Beijing, countries told the
group to ensure that those selling and using new domains comply
with laws and safeguard certain generic names -- among them
.money, .pay, and .save, as well as .poker, .book and .weather.  Under Icann procedures, the group’s board is to consider
advice from the governmental committee, which has
representatives from the U.S., U.K.,  Germany ,  China ,  Japan  and
the European Commission.  “The expansion could create opportunities for scammers to
defraud consumers online, shrink law enforcement’s ability to
catch scam artists, and divert the resources of legitimate
businesses into litigating and protecting their own good
names,” Julie Brill, a Federal Trade Commission member, said in
a March 20 speech to the Association of National Advertisers.  For more, click here.  For trademark news, click here.  Deals  Kodak Agrees to $210 Million Imaging Sale to Brother to Set Bid  Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) , the bankrupt photography pioneer, agreed
to sell document-imaging assets to Japanese office-equipment
company  Brother Industries Ltd. (6448)  for about $210 million, setting
the minimum bid for an auction.  Any deal requires approval from the judge overseeing
Rochester, New York-based Kodak’s bankruptcy case, the companies
said in statements yesterday. Nagoya, Japan-based Brother’s bid
also assumes about $67 million of customer prepayment
liabilities.  Kodak is selling businesses to shrink and to fund its shift
into commercial printing and packaging after seeking Chapter 11
protection in January 2012. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Perez in December sold some of Kodak’s digital-imaging patents
for about $525 million, and is also looking for buyers for its
consumer-film and photo-kiosks divisions and shuttering its
consumer inkjet-printer unit.  The deal would add Kodak scanners, image-capture software
and technical services to Brother’s printers and fax machines.
An auction with Brother as the stalking horse, or initial
bidder, will be run after sales procedures are approved this
month, Kodak said.  Kodak filed for bankruptcy after years of burning through
cash as the rise of digital photography eroded its film
business. The company cut about 4,000 jobs last year and spent
$3.4 billion on restructuring before bankruptcy, including
payouts to fire 47,000 employees since 2003.  The bankruptcy case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-
bk-10202, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  Royalty Pharma Raises Offer for Elan to as Much as $12 an ADR  Royalty Pharma, an investor in royalty streams from drugs,
raised its offer to buy  Elan Corp. (ELN)  to as much as $12 an American
depositary receipt, threatening the Irish drugmaker’s plan to
embark on its own acquisitions.  The formal offer is higher than a previous informal bid of
$11 an ADR, and compares with the $12.01 closing price on April
12. The proposal is a “firm, fully financed offer,” New York-
based Royalty said in a statement yesterday.  Royalty Pharma has said the sale of Elan would allow
shareholders to avoid the risks of Chief Executive Officer Kelly Martin’s strategy of reinvesting a portion of the $3.25 billion
Elan received from  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB)  for  divesting  its stake in
the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. Elan, based in Dublin, is
also buying back $1 billion of stock, a proposal shareholders
approved last week.  Royalty Pharma has said it plans to pay for the acquisition
with more than $1.1 billion in available cash and through debt
financing to be arranged by Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase & Co. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Groton Partners are
advising Royalty Pharma.  Founded in 1996, the company owns royalty interests in 37
approved and marketed pharmaceutical products. For example, in
2004, the firm bought Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center’s
U.S. royalty interest in  Amgen Inc. (AMGN) ’s Neupogen drug. Pablo Legorreta, the founder, previously worked as a banker at Lazard.  “The board of Elan will, in line with its obligations
under Irish takeover law, promptly assess the Royalty Pharma
announcement and will advise its shareholders accordingly,” the
company said in a statement yesterday.  For more, click here.  To contact the reporter on this story:
