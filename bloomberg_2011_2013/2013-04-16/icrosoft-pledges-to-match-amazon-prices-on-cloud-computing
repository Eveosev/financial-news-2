Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , which is releasing
new cloud-computing services today, said it will match
 Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s lowest prices for competing products as it
seeks to win business in a growing market.  Microsoft is rolling out Windows Azure Infrastructure
Services, which will let customers run existing applications on
servers and storage machines in Microsoft data centers, after
more than nine months of testing. The company also committed to
match market leader Amazon on prices for computing and storage
services, even if Amazon cuts rates, said Steven Martin, general
manager of Windows Azure Business Strategy.  Seventy-one percent of respondents in a  Forrester Research
Inc. (FORR)  survey said they used Amazon Web Services for cloud
computing, compared with about 10 percent each for Microsoft,
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  and other vendors. Revenue from public cloud
services, which let customers run applications in an outside
vendor’s data center and access them via the Internet, jumped 20
percent last year to $109 billion, Gartner Inc. estimates.  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the world’s largest
software maker, has more than 200,000 customers for its Azure
cloud products, and 1,000 new ones sign up daily, Martin said in
an interview.  Microsoft rose 1 percent to $28.97 at the close in New
York. The stock has advanced 8.5 percent this year, compared
with a 10 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
