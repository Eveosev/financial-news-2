Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  offered to
sell the Czech government its minority stake in Ceska Rafinerska
AS, Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kuba said.  “We got an offer earlier this year,” Kuba said today at a
conference in Prague. “We’ll need to discuss it with other
economic ministries.”  Ceska Rafinerska, controlled by Unipetrol AS, operates two
refineries. While Unipetrol holds a 51 percent stake in the
refiner, Eni SpA of  Italy  owns 32.5 percent and Shell the rest.
Czech government officials have said in the past they would be
keen to snap up minority stakes in the country’s refineries
should they come up for sale.  The government’s potential acquisition of Shell’s 16.5
percent stake would make sense as part of a larger takeover
strategy of the country’s oil industry, the minister said. Part
of that would include combining state-controlled pipeline
operator Mero with Cepro, which controls the freight, storage
and sale of oil products and operates the Czech national oil
reserves.  “The acquisition of the Ceska Rafinerska stake in itself
is not strategically important,” Kuba said. “It would work
only as a part of a larger return of the state into the
petrochemical industry.”  Shell declined to comment on the possible sale of the
stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
