Anhui BBCA Group Co. will invest $320 million building a corn-processing plant in  Brazil ’s Mato Grosso do Sul state, according to the state’s governor.  The Chinese company plans to start building the plant next year and begin operations by 2015, Governor Andre Puccinelli said at a press conference in Beijing today. The plant will be able to process 600,000 tons of corn a year, while about 60 percent of the products, including glucose and lysine, will be exported, he said.  BBCA is biochemical producer based in  China ’s eastern Anhui province. Li Chaohui, BBCA’s assistant to the president, didn’t answer two calls made by Bloomberg News to his office.
