South Korea’s won rose, reversing
an earlier decline, as local stocks rebounded following a sell-
off in the morning.  Government bonds  advanced.  The Kospi index of shares gained 0.1 percent after falling
as much as 1.2 percent earlier, after reports that China’s
economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter and manufacturing
in the New York region expanded less than projected in April.
South Korea plans 19.3 trillion won ($17 billion) of additional
fiscal support to spur growth, the  Finance Ministry  said today.  “With stocks rebounding, sentiment is turning around a
bit,” said Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency dealer at
Daegu Bank. “The market is receiving some exporter dollar flows
from heavy-industry companies.”  The won strengthened 0.5 percent to 1,115.14 per dollar in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It weakened as
much as 0.4 percent earlier. The currency jumped 0.8 percent to
1,120.48 yesterday, the most since Feb. 4, after the U.S. said
it had agreed to work with China, Japan and  South Korea  to try
and draw North Korea back into nuclear talks.  One-month implied volatility in the won, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.69 percent.  China’s economy  expanded 7.7 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, compared with 7.9 percent in the preceding
three months, official data showed yesterday. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic index dropped to 3.1
this month from 9.2 in March. The median projection of 47
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government bonds due March
2018 fell seven basis points to 2.68 percent, according to
prices from Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
