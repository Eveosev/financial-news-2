Cattle futures rose on speculation
that U.S. meat purchases will increase as the weather warms up
and more consumers grill outdoors. Hog prices also climbed.  Wholesale  beef  rose 0.2 percent to $1.8989 a pound
yesterday, the first increase in almost a week, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. Meatpackers processed 122,000 cattle
yesterday, up 5.2 percent from the previous week, government
data show.  Prices are increasing on “the optimism that we’re getting
closer to a timeframe that temperatures do start to warm up and
better grilling and better demand,”  Don Roose , the president of
U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a
telephone interview.  Cattle futures for June delivery advanced 0.4 percent to
$1.203 a pound at 10:48 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The price was down 9.4 percent this year through yesterday.  Hog futures for June settlement added 0.6 percent to 89.125
cents a pound on the CME. Through yesterday, prices gained 3.4
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slid less than
0.1 percent to $1.4635 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
