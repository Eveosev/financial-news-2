MGM Resorts International (MGM)  and
Cadillac Fairview Corp. are a step closer to building a casino
in Toronto after the mayor’s executive committee voted in favor
of gaming in  Canada ’s biggest city.  Mayor Rob Ford’s executive committee voted to approve a
casino as long as 43 conditions are met including funding for
social programs relating to gambling and that financial benefits
are earmarked for public transit.  Developers MGM, Cadillac Fairview, owned by Ontario
Teachers’ Pension Plan, and Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System’s (OMERS) Oxford Properties Group Inc. have
all submitted proposals to build a casino.  The issue now proceeds to full council for a vote by all 44
members.  Oxford Properties said major Las Vegas casino operators
expressed interest in its C$3 billion ($3.1 billion) proposal to
develop a casino.  Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR) ,  Las Vegas Sands
Corp. (LVS)  and MGM have all worked with Oxford on a proposal, said
Oxford Chief Executive Officer Blake Hutcheson said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
