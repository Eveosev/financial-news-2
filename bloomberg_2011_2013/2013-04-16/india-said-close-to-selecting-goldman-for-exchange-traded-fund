India is close to appointing
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to manage an exchange-traded fund that
will include companies part-owned by the government, said three
people with knowledge of the matter.  The selection of New York-based Goldman’s asset management
unit is awaiting approval from Indian Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram, said one of the people, who asked not
to be identified as the process is private. It will then go to
the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, this person said.  An aide to President  Pranab Mukherjee  said in September
that India was working on an exchange-traded fund that tracks
state-owned companies, as the government seeks to attract money
to its stock market. Officials haven’t decided which stocks will
be included in the fund, one person said.  D.S. Malik, a spokesman for India’s finance ministry, and
Edward Naylor, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
