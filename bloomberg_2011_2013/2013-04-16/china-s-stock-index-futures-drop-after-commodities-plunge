China’s stocks  rebounded from a
three-month low, as property shares jumped on speculation the
government won’t impose any more real-estate curbs as economic
growth slows and lower oil boosted auto companies and airlines.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  and Poly Real Estate Group Co. led a gauge
of developers to its biggest gain since February.  SAIC Motor
Corp. (600104)  and  China Eastern  Airlines Co. rose at least 3.6 percent
after  Brent crude  fell below $100 a barrel for the first time
since July.  China  Life Insurance Co. and Ping An Insurance
(Group) Co. gained after the government said it will allow
shareholders to take bigger stakes in insurers.  “There was bargain hunting as investors took advantage of
the earlier slump and the policy risk of property stocks has
almost faded,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at
Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “Concern
about economic growth lingers and will weigh on sentiment.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.6 percent to 2,194.85
at the close, erasing a loss of as much as 0.7 percent. The CSI
300 Index added 0.9 percent to 2,459.59. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  gained 0.3 percent.  The Shanghai index has fallen 9.8 percent from a Feb. 6
high amid concern steps to cool  property  prices will drag on
growth. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  slid 3.3 percent
yesterday and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 2.3 percent.
U.S. stocks extended losses after explosions rocked the finish
line area of the Boston Marathon. Three people were killed and
at least 128 people were hospitalized, officials said.  ‘Fine Tune’  China’s statistics bureau said yesterday the economy grew
7.7 percent in the first quarter, less than the 8 percent median
forecast in a survey of 41 economists. At least four brokerages
cut their growth forecasts after the data, including JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Daiwa  Capital Markets , Nomura Holdings Inc. and
Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.  China should “fine tune” its economic policies in the
short-term to maintain “reasonable” growth, according to a
front-page commentary in the China Securities Journal today.
China is expected to keep a “neutral”  monetary policy ,
according to the commentary.  “Monetary policy will likely remain tight given
simultaneous food and housing inflation, and hence lead to weak
growth,” Hao Hong, Bank of Communications Co.’s Hong Kong-based
China strategist, wrote in an e-mailed response to questions.
“Swine and avian diseases will likely create a food supply
shortage in the second half of the year, and thus food
inflation.” Fourteen people have died from the H7N9 avian
influenza.  Valuations on the Shanghai gauge dropped to 9 times
projected 12-month earnings, near the lowest level since Dec. 13
and less than the seven-year average of 15.8,  data  compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Developers Rebound  The 14-day relative strength  measure  for the Shanghai
Composite, measuring how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped
during a specified time period, was at 31.8 yesterday. Readings
below 30 indicate it may be poised to rise.  The Shanghai property stock index gained 3.8 percent today,
the highest close since March 1. Vanke, the nation’s biggest
listed property developer, rose 5.5 percent to 11.64  yuan .  Poly
Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , the second largest, jumped 6 percent to
12.46 yuan. Gemdale Corp. surged 6.8 percent to 7.42 yuan.  “As uncertainties remain, investors are looking for areas
with less negative news for return,” said BoCom’s Hong.
‘Property is such a candidate -- with the curbs already strict
enough and probably cannot be any tighter. The sector has
performance to show for itself.’’  Bigger Stakes  The statistics bureau is due to release March property
prices on April 18.  SAIC, China’s largest carmaker, climbed 3.8 percent to
15.49 yuan. China Eastern, the nation’s second-largest carrier,
gained 3.6 percent to 3.16 yuan. Brent futures slid as much as
2.6 percent to $98 a barrel.  China Life, the nation’s biggest insurer, rose 2.2 percent
to 17.42 yuan.  Ping An (601318) , the second largest, added 2.5 percent to
41.53 yuan.  China will allow some single shareholders to hold a stake
of more than 20 percent in insurance companies, according to a
statement posted on the website of China Insurance Regulatory
Commission.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 21 percent
lower than the 30-day average today, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Thirty-day  volatility  on the gauge was at 17.3,
the lowest level since Feb. 20, the data showed.  Zijin Mining Group Co. (601899) , China’s biggest gold producer, slid
1.3 percent to 3.16 yuan, extending yesterday’s 5.6 percent
loss. The stock closed at its lowest level since Jan. 13, 2009.
 Zhongjin Gold Co. (600489) , the country’s third-largest bullion producer,
retreated 3.3 percent to 12.51 yuan.  Gold Plunge  Investors should keep away from Hong Kong-traded gold
miners including Zijin Mining and Zhaojin Mining Industry Co.
because of their “high earnings sensitivity” to the bullion
price, Richard Gao, an analyst at Guosen Securities Co., wrote
in a note today.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
dropped 2.3 percent to 608.83 yesterday, the lowest settlement
since July 10.  Gold prices  tumbled 9.3 percent, crude oil slid
2.8 percent and copper fell 2.3 percent.  Investors are concerned the plunge in gold prices may
trigger equity sales in order to cover losses, Lee Boon Keng,
head of Bank Julius Baer & Co.’s investment solutions group in
Singapore, said by phone today.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., dropped 3 percent, the most
since June.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC)  plunged 7.4 percent to trade
at the biggest discount to its Hong Kong stock since October.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
