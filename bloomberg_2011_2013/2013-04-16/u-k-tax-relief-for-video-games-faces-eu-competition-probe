U.K. tax incentives to video games
developers face a probe from European Union competition
investigators, who questioned whether the aid is needed to spur
the industry.  “The market for developing video games is dynamic and
commercially promising,”  Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s antitrust
commissioner, said in an e-mailed statement today. “It is not
clear whether the taxpayer should be subsidizing this activity.
Such subsidies could even distort competition.”  The U.K. measures may “fuel a subsidy race between member
states, the European Commission said in the statement.  The EU regulator said it wasn’t clear that a proposed
cultural test to qualify for support ‘‘ensures that the aid
supports only games with cultural content without leading to
undue distortions of competition.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
