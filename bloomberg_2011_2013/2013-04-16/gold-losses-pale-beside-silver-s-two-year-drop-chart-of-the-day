Gold’s plunge in the past two
trading days came nowhere near delivering the kind of losses
that investors in another precious metal, silver, endured the
past two years.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, silver for immediate
delivery tumbled 53 percent from its April 2011 closing high of
$48.44 an ounce through yesterday. Gold was higher throughout
most of this period. The chart compares spot prices for the
metals in the top panel.  One ounce of gold was equivalent to 59.22 ounces of silver
as of yesterday, as the bottom panel shows. The ratio rose from
31.7 ounces at silver’s peak two years ago and surpassed its
2012 high of 58.9 ounces, set in June.  “Silver needs more of a push from investment demand and
industrial demand than gold,” George Gero, a vice president and
precious-metals strategist in New York for RBC Capital Markets,
said yesterday in an interview. “Nobody’s really adding silver
to their inventory.”  Jewelry, silverware, coins and other investments accounted
for 47 percent of demand in 2011, according to figures compiled
by the Washington-based Silver Institute. The rest was used for
consumer electronics, solar cells, batteries, photographic film
and additional products.  Silver tumbled 18 percent in the past two days, exceeding a
14 percent loss for gold. Yet the decline in silver was only the
biggest since September 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Gold had its steepest slide since February 1983.  To contact the reporter on this story:
