Bovespa-index futures declined as
economists lowered forecasts for  Brazil ’s manufacturing output
growth this year and next, adding to concern that recovery in
Latin America’s largest economy is faltering.  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , Brazil’s second-biggest bank by market
value, may move after reporting first-quarter sales that missed
analysts’ estimates. Kroton Educacional SA may be active after
saying it agreed to buy competitor  Anhanguera Educacional
Participacoes SA (AEDU3)  to form the world’s largest education company.  Bovespa-index  futures contracts  expiring in June dropped
0.2 percent to 54,000 at 9:20 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real was
unchanged at 2.0111 per dollar.  Industrial output will grow 2.86 percent this year,
according to the median forecast among 100 economists surveyed
by Brazil’s central bank. That compares with an estimate of 3
percent a week earlier. Expansion in 2013 is seen at 3.75
percent, down from 3.8 percent, the survey showed.  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  has retreated 15 percent from this year’s high
on Jan. 3 amid concern accelerating inflation may curb Brazil’s
economic recovery and the government’s interventionist policies
will hurt profits in industries including utilities and energy.
The  MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC)  of shares in Brazil,  Russia ,  India  and  China 
has lost 8.6 percent over the same period.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 11.1 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.4 for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 6.13 billion
reais ($3.05 billion) on April 19, which compares with a daily
average of 7.69 billion reais this year through April 17,
according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
