Navistar International Corp. (NAV)  named
 Jack Allen  its No. 2 executive as the truckmaker continues to
revamp its management.  Allen, 55, today was named executive vice president and
chief operating officer, effective immediately, Navistar said in
a statement.  The company last month namedTroy Clarke, 57, as chief
executive officer, effective yesterday. Clarke, a former  General
Motors Co. (GM)  executive, joined the Lisle, Illinois-based company
in 2010. James Keyes, a board member since 2002, became non-
executive chairman this week.  Navistar is trying to end losses. The truckmaker ousted Dan
Ustian as CEO in August after an inquiry from regulators about
its accounting and disclosures. Lewis Campbell, a former CEO of
 Textron Inc. (TXT) , took the helm as interim head of the company
before yielding to Clarke. Navistarâ€™s net loss for the November-
to-January fiscal first quarter narrowed to $123 million from
$153 million a year earlier, the company said last month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
