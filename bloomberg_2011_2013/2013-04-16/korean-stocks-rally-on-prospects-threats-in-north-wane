Korean stocks  surged the most in
nine months in New York on speculation that threats from North
Korea may be diminishing after the totalitarian state said it
doesn’t oppose resuming talks with the U.S.  The  Bank of New York Mellon Korea ADR Index , which tracks
American depositary receipts of South Korean companies, rose 3.4
percent to 177.31 at 12:08 p.m., set for the biggest gain since
June 29. That followed the benchmark Kospi Index’s 0.1 percent
gain to 1,922.21 in  Seoul . The won advanced 0.5 percent versus
the dollar.  In its first conciliatory gesture following months of
threats to attack South Korea and American bases, an
unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman said North Korea wasn’t
opposed to resuming dialogue with the U.S. in a statement today
on the official Korean Central News Agency. Korean ADRs have
declined 6.3 percent as the totalitarian state has repeatedly
said the region is on the brink of war since conducting a
nuclear test in February.  “It’s a valuation thing, plus lack of threats from North
Korea,” Elena Ogram, who manages $50 million in emerging-
markets assets at Bank am Bellevue AG in Zurich, said by
telephone. “People get tired of being afraid all the time.
They’re looking at stocks that have better fundamentals and
appealing valuations.”  ADRs of LG Display Co., the world’s second-biggest maker of
flat panels, added 2.9 percent to $14.04 in New York. Steelmaker
 Posco (005490)  jumped 3.3 percent to $71.93, the biggest advance since
Jan. 2.  South Korea unveiled a 17.3 trillion won ($15.4 billion)
supplementary budget to boost growth by 0.3 percentage points
and create 40,000 jobs, the Finance Ministry said in a statement
in Sejong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
