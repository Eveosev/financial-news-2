Canada  needs to maintain its
publicly funded health care and education systems to curb  income
inequality , Diana Carney told a parliamentary committee.  “It’s all about institutions, and preserving, maintaining
and building the institutions that have served us so well in the
past,” Carney, vice president of research at Ottawa-based
research group  Canada 2020 , told the finance committee of the
nation’s legislature today.  Canada has the sixth-highest level of income inequality
among 17 developed countries, and the gap increased in the two
decades to 2010, according to an  analysis  published by the
 Conference Board of Canada . The U.S. had the highest level of
income equality.  “One of the things we need to do, I would argue, is make
sure that the whole population keeps engaged with those
institutions,” said Carney, spouse of Bank of Canada Governor
and Bank of England Governor-designate  Mark Carney .  “One of the main differences between us and the U.S. is
the rich, the plutocrats that Chrystia Freeland talks about,
they disengage from using the public health system but they also
disengage from public education,” Carney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
