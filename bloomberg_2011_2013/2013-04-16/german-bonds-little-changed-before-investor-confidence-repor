Italy ’s bonds rose, with 10-year
yields falling toward the lowest in seven weeks, as the Treasury
said it would close an inflation-linked debt sale to individual
investors two days early after demand increased.  German bunds dropped for the first time in four days as a
euro-area report showed so-called core consumer prices fell more
than economists forecast, damping speculation the European
Central Bank will cut interest rates at its next meeting.
 Portugal ’s bonds advanced for a fifth day after the nation won
extra time from European finance ministers last week to pay back
emergency loans.  “Italy is outperforming on the back of the inflation-
linked sale,” said Gianluca Ziglio, executive director of
fixed-income research at Sunrise Brokers LLP in  London . “ECB
action is all about inflation. The core figure was stronger than
expected, it defuses the risk of an ECB cut for the moment.
That’s why German yields are rising.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.31 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
dropping to 4.26 percent on April 8, the lowest level since Feb.
25. The 5.5 percent bond due November 2022 gained 0.215, or 2.15
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,313) face amount, to 109.57.  Italian Sale  The Rome-based Treasury said it would end the sale of the
four-year inflation-linked bonds to retail investors today after
orders climbed to 8.98 billion euros yesterday, more than three
times the 2.48 billion euros on the first day of the previous
sale of the securities in October.  Investors ordered another 8 billion euros of the debt
today. The Treasury had initially planned to take orders through
April 18.  Spain sold 5.07 billion euros of six- and 12-month bills
today, exceeding its maximum target of 5 billion euros. The
nation’s  10-year yield  was little changed at 4.73 percent.  German bunds declined as the European Union’s statistics
office said the euro-area core inflation rate, which excludes
volatile costs such as energy, alcohol and tobacco, climbed to
1.5 percent in March from 1.3 percent the previous month. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was 1.4 percent.  The 10-year bund yield climbed three basis points to 1.28
percent after dropping to 1.20 percent on April 5, the lowest
level since July 24.  A separate report from the ZEW Center for European Economic
Research showed German investor sentiment worsened more than
economists predicted in April.  Most Volatile  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Finland and  Germany ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Portuguese  10-year yields  declined 15 basis points to 6.10
percent after falling to 6.08 percent, the lowest since March
26. The rate has fallen 36 basis points in the past five days.  European finance ministers meeting in Dublin on April 12
gave Portugal seven extra years to repay creditors as long as it
enacts new budget cuts to make up for savings that were thrown
out by the country’s highest court on April 5.  German bonds returned 0.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
debt gained 5 percent and Italy’s rose 2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
