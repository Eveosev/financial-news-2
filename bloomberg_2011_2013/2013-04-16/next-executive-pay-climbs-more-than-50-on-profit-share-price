Next Plc’s (NXT)  top executives received
more than 50 percent extra in remuneration last year, driven by
a 9 percent profit increase and a surge in the share price of
the U.K.’s second-largest clothing retailer.  Total pay for the chairman, executive and non-executive
directors climbed to 17.6 million pounds ($27 million) in the 12
months ended January from 11.6 million pounds a year earlier,
according to the London-based retailer’s  annual report . Director
of Product Christos Angelides’s pay more than doubled to 5.43
million pounds, while Chief Executive Officer Simon Wolfson’s
pay increased 13 percent to 4.6 million pounds, even after he
waived a potential 2.4 million-pound share-matching award.  Next  shares  climbed 36 percent last year as a tight rein on
costs and improved product ranges boosted profitability. That
compared with the benchmark U.K. FTSE 100 Index’s 5.8 percent
gain. Angelides, who joined in 1986 and oversees design, buying,
quality and merchandising, was awarded 125 percent of his salary
as part of a long-term incentive plan because of the “strategic
importance of his product skills,” according to the report.  The retailer reported annual underlying pretax profit
growth that topped expectations last month, with an increase of
9 percent. Still, the retailer said the start of the new fiscal
year has been “quiet” as cold weather delays spring purchases
and economic woes weigh on spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
