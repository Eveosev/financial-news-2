Chateau Gazin, a Pomerol estate
on Bordeaux’s right bank, cut the price of its 2012 wine futures
to 39 euros ($51) a bottle, 7 percent down from the 42 euro
release price for its 2011 wines, Decanter.com said.  Gazin marks the first major Bordeaux futures release
following last week’s trade tastings, according to Decanter
magazine’s website. Etablissements Jean-Pierre Moueix announced
prices in the Belgian market earlier this month about 15 percent
below last year’s levels, and while Bordeaux merchants reported
brisk sales of Gazin, U.K. merchants said the drop didn’t fully
recognize market conditions, Decanter.com reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
