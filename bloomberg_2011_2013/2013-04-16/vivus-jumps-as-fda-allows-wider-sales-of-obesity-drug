Vivus Inc. (VVUS)  rose the most in three
months after U.S. regulators said the drugmaker can sell its
obesity pill Qsymia in more pharmacies than first allowed.  Vivus gained 3.5 percent to $11.55 at 3:23 p.m.  New York 
time, after advancing as much as 11 percent in the biggest
intraday increase since Jan. 7. The company had fallen by more
than half since winning approval for the drug on July 17, as
sales were slower than investors expected.  Qsymia, which the  Food and Drug Administration  restricted
to sales through certain mail-order pharmacies, can now be
offered through certified retail pharmacies as well, the
 Mountain View , California-based company said today in a
statement. Vivus’s goal is to make Qsymia available in thousands
of retailers over the next three months, President Peter Tam
said in the statement.  The change “is a key accomplishment in removing a major
barrier that has hindered the initial acceptance of Qsymia into
everyday medical practice,” Tam said. “Retail access, along
with ongoing improvements in reimbursement, will help to
accelerate Qsymia awareness, trial and usage.”  Qsymia is a combination of the appetite suppressant
phentermine and the antiseizure drug topiramate, both of which
are available separately in generic form. Qsymia accounted for
2.5 percent of total obesity prescriptions as of April 5,
compared with 87 percent for phentermine,  Andrew Berens , an
analyst with Bloomberg Industries, said yesterday in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
