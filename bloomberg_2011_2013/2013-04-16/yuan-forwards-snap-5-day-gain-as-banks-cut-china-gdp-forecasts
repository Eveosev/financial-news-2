The yuan climbed to a 19-year high
after the central bank raised its  reference rate  for a third
day, even as banks cut growth forecasts for  China  and Moody’s
Investors Service lowered its outlook on the sovereign rating.  The People’s Bank of China strengthened the daily  fixing  by
0.07 percent to 6.2408 per dollar, before a meeting of the Group
of 20 nations this week that may discuss the impact of exchange
rates on global trade. The currency is allowed to trade as much
as 1 percent on either side of the fixing. Moody’s scaled back
today its outlook for China’s credit rating to stable from
positive, citing risks from local-government debt.  “The stronger fixing may be a gesture, given the potential
external pressure” to allow the  yuan  to rise further, said
Tommy Xie, a treasury economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
in  Singapore . “This trend may not last because of the weaker
economic data.”  The yuan gained 0.1 percent to 6.1831 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to prices from the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It earlier touched 6.1798, the strongest level
since the government unified official and market exchange rates
at the end of 1993.  The U.S. Treasury Department asked Japan to refrain from
devaluing the yen, while declining to name China as a currency
manipulator in a semi-annual currency report to Congress on
April 12. The G-20 nations meet in Washington on April 18-19.  Economic Growth  China’s economy  grew  7.7 percent  in the three months ended
March 31 from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said
yesterday, after a 7.9 percent gain in the previous quarter.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. pared its estimate for this year’s increase
in China’s gross domestic product to 7.8 percent from 8.2
percent yesterday, while  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  lowered its
projection to 8.2 percent from 8.6 percent.  “We expect the yuan to weaken from here to the year-end,”
said Jackit Wong, a regional economist at Natixis Asia Ltd. in
Hong Kong. “The weak data in the first quarter says people will
have to get used to below-8 percent growth for many quarters to
come.”  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan fell to 6.1875 per
dollar from 6.1860 yesterday and reached a one-week low of
6.1965, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards were little changed at 6.2570.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
decreased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.35
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
