Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest
U.S. discount retailer, said first-quarter profit will be less
than it previously expected as cold weather hampered sales of
spring merchandise.  Adjusted profit in the current quarter will be less than
the low end of its forecast range of $1.10 to $1.20 a share, the
Minneapolis-based company said today in a statement. The average
of 10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $1.11 a
share.  Target Chief Executive Officer  Gregg Steinhafel  has been
trying to boost sales by adding fresh food to stores and
enticing shoppers to buy more with a discount card. The company
said today that colder-than-usual spring temperatures are
hurting sales in weather-sensitive categories throughout its
stores.  The shares fell 1.3 percent to $67.60 at 8:08 a.m. in New
York. Target had gained 16 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with an 8.8 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  The company maintained its forecast for full-year profit of
$4.85 to $5.05 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
