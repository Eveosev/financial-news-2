A current and a former executive
with a U.S. unit of French power-equipment maker  Alstom SA (ALO)  were
charged with bribing government officials in Indonesia to win a
contract.  Frederic Pierucci, 45, the current executive, was arrested
April 14 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York,
according to a statement yesterday from the U.S.  Justice
Department . The French national is accused of conspiracy,
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and  money
laundering , according to the statement.  The former executive, David Rothschild, 67, pleaded guilty
in November in federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, to
conspiracy to violate the FCPA, the Justice Department said.  “Alstom has been working constructively with the
Department of Justice for the last two years to address any
allegations of past misconduct,”  Tim Brown , a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “In the meantime, the
company is committed to assuring that it conducts its worldwide
business fully in compliance with all laws and regulations.”  Stanley Twardy, a lawyer for Pierucci, declined to comment
on the charges. Michael Jennings, a lawyer for Rothschild,
didn’t immediately return a call for comment after regular
business hours.  The cases are U.S. v. Pierucci, 12-00238, and U.S. v.
Rothschild, 12-00223, U.S. District Court, District of
Connecticut (New Haven).  To contact the reporter on this story:
