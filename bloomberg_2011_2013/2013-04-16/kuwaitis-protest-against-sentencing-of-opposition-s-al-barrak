Thousands of Kuwaitis marched late
yesterday southwest of  Kuwait City  to protest against the
sentencing of opposition leader Musallam Al-Barrak to five years
in prison.  Demonstrators gathered in Al-Andalus residential area
before marching to the central prison, hours after the sentence
was handed down against Al-Barrak, a former lawmaker. He was
charged with insulting Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al- Sabah and challenging his power, lawyer Mohammed Al-Jasem said
yesterday. An appeal will be filed against the ruling, the
lawyer said.  Al-Barrak was at the forefront of a series of rallies by
 Kuwait ’s opposition movement last year calling for political
reforms. Protests mounted after the emir said in October that he
asked the government to change the electoral system to “bolster
the democratic process” and safeguard national unity.  The changes led the opposition to boycott December’s
parliamentary election. The  Constitutional Court  is due to rule
on the amendments on June 16, and the verdict may lead to
further instability.  “Kuwait has a transparent and independent judicial
system,” the Ministry of Information said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. “All citizens, regardless of their
position, are equal in the eyes of the law. Anyone accused of a
crime in Kuwait will get a fair trial with a comprehensive legal
defense and open appeals process.”  The emir is inviolable under the country’s constitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
