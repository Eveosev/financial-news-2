The  New York  Jets re-signed outside
linebacker Calvin Pace to a one-year contract, two months after
releasing him to reduce team payroll, NFL.com reported.  Pace, a 10-year National Football League veteran, was under
contract to make $11.6 million this season before he was cut in
February to make room under the NFLâ€™s salary cap, ESPN said at
the time.  He was a first-round draft pick in 2003 of the  Arizona
Cardinals  from Wake Forest University. He joined the Jets in
2008. Pace, 32, has 42 sacks during his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
