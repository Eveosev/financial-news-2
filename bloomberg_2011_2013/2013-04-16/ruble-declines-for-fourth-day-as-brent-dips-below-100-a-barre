The ruble weakened for a fourth day
against the central bank’s target basket of currencies as oil in
 London  fell to below $100 a barrel.  The ruble declined less than 0.1 percent against Bank
Rossii’s dollar-euro basket, extending yesterday’s 1 percent
drop, to 35.7682 by 2:48 p.m. in Moscow. The Russian currency
appreciated 0.2 percent against the dollar to 31.3825.  “Oil is the main news maker,” Artem Roschin, a foreign
exchange trader at Aljba Alliance LLC in Moscow, said by phone.
“The market is watching whether it stalls, continues to decline
or reverse.”  Brent oil sank below $100 a barrel for the first time since
July, dropping 0.8 percent to $99.87 a barrel amid signs global
economic growth may slow. The ZEW Center for European Economic
Research in Mannheim said today its index of investor and
analyst expectations, which aims to predict economic
developments six months in advance, fell to 36.3 from a three-
year high of 48.5 in March.  The yield on benchmark OFZ bonds due February 2027 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.21 percent before a
Finance Ministry announcement of yield guidance for tomorrow’s
auctions of securities. The government plans to offer 20 billion
rubles ($637 million) of notes due January 2023 and 10 billion
rubles of OFZs due January 2018.  “Even if the issuer offers premium, people will abstain
from buying sovereign bonds in this volatile environment,”
Ekaterina Leonova, an analyst with OAO Alfa Bank, said in a note
to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
