The  United Arab Emirates , the
Persian Gulf state with 6 percent of global oil reserves, plans
to encourage investment in renewable energy, the country’s new
energy minister said.  “We are trying to create a strategy for an integrated
 energy policy  that includes renewables, nuclear and oil and
gas,” Suhail Mohammed Al Mazrouei, who became a minister last
month, said today at a conference in Dubai. Renewable energy
“is the future.”  The U.A.E. belongs to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and is boosting its oil-production capacity
to 3 million barrels a day. It also operates two solar  power
plants  and plans a wind-power project. The country expects to
have 5,600 megawatts of nuclear-power capacity by 2020, or about
a quarter of its projected generating capacity, Al Mazrouei
said.  The government should promote private investment in power
projects and form an energy policy that unifies all the emirates
in the seven-member federation, he said in his first speech as
energy minister.  Al Mazrouei took charge of the ministry on March 12 from
Mohamed Bin Dhaen Al-Hamli, an eight-year veteran. Al Mazrouei
serves on the advisory committee of  Abu Dhabi ’s Supreme
Petroleum Council, which sets energy policy in the country’s
largest emirate, and works as deputy chief executive officer of
Mubadala Petroleum, a state-owned energy investor, which is
helping supply the U.A.E. with imported natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
