Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, updated its corporate foreign-exchange electronic
trading platform to help clients hedge currency-market exposure.  The revised system, to be known as Pulse 2.0, will include
trading of derivatives known as structured options and will
provide access to 700 currency pairs, the New York-based bank
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Citigroup is the world’s biggest foreign-exchange trader
for companies with a 10.1 percent share of the market, followed
by HSBC Holdings Plc’s 8.4 percent and Deutsche Bank AG’s 7.9
percent, according to a Greenwich Associates report last month.
The firms are seeking opportunities to boost revenue amid rising
demand from corporates for protection against swings in exchange
rates that may dent earnings.  “CitiFX Pulse is, and has always been, about corporate
foreign-exchange hedging and now more so than ever,” Yi Hahn Chin, its global product manager, said in the statement. A new
“exposure-management module” will provide end-users with
control across their global businesses, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
