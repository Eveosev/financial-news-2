Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)  may wrap up
financing and make a final  investment decision  in the next four
to six weeks on whether to build third and fourth production
units for its Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export project.  Construction can start once financing is in place, Cheniere
Chief Executive Officer Charif Souki said in an interview at the
LNG 17 conference in Houston today. The first unit at Sabine
Pass in Louisiana remains ahead of schedule for a late 2015
start, he said. A second unit may be operating about six months
later.  The first two units will cost about $5.6 billion, the
Houston-based company has said. Cheniereâ€™s Sabine Pass project
is the only one with full U.S. approval for LNG exports. Gas
output from U.S. shale formations caused a glut in domestic
supplies, resulting in prices falling to a 10-year low last
year. To reach new markets, companies have proposed about 30
billion cubic feet of daily U.S. gas export capacity.  Cheniere may file an application with the  Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission  in September or October for a possible
fifth and sixth unit at Sabine Pass, Souki said. The company
also is about six months away from having a good understanding
on the cost structure for a possible LNG export project near
 Corpus Christi , Texas, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
