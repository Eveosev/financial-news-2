The New York Mets will try to play
a doubleheader today against the Colorado Rockies after snow
postponed yesterday’s game at Coors Field in Denver.  It was the second postponement in as many days for the Mets,
who also weren’t able to play their April 14 game against the
Minnesota Twins because of wintry conditions in  Minneapolis .  “When you’re scheduled to play these seven days in the two
towns we’re in, you’ve got a chance to run into some bad weather
this time of year,” Mets manager Terry Collins told reporters.
“We have, and we’ll just adjust.”  This was the first time the Mets have had consecutive Major
League Baseball games postponed since Aug. 27-28, 2011, because
of Hurricane Irene, according to the team’s website.  Several Mets catchers and pitchers, including Matt Harvey,
bundled up and played catch in the snow yesterday after learning
the game would be postponed.  There is the possibility of more snow today in Denver, as
the  National Weather Service  forecast calls for a 50 percent
chance of rain and snow during the day and a 50 percent chance
of snow at night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
