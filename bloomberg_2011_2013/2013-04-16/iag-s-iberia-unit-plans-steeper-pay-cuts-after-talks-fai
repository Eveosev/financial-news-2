British Airways parent IAG SA’s
Spanish unit Iberia said it will implement deeper wage cuts for
staff following the failure of productivity talks.  Pay will be reduced by 18 percent for pilots and cabin crew
and 11 percent for groundstaff, in line with a mediation plan,
Iberia said in an e-mail. The cuts are 4 percentage points
higher than had been offered as part of a negotiated deal.  “There has been no agreement,” the Madrid-based carrier
said in response to questions. “Talks finished yesterday, so
the cuts will be put into effect.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
