RWE Npower Plc was attacked by
U.K. lawmakers for not paying corporation tax in the last three
fiscal years, after the energy company said it is allowed to
reduce its tax liability because of its investments.  Lawmakers on the cross-party Energy Committee of the House
of Commons asked Npower Chief Executive Officer Paul Massara to
confirm whether the company had paid the tax in the last
three years. Opposition Labour Party lawmaker Ian Lavery said he
was “amazed” to learn it had not.  “We will not pay corporation tax in those three years and
that is for the simple reason that effectively we have invested
5 billion pounds in the last five years,” Massara said during
the parliamentary hearing today in  London . “That is a simple
accounting U.K. rule. There is no mystery to it. There is no
desire to not pay tax.”  Western nations, seeking to shrink budget deficits, are
looking for ways to raise more money from companies to placate
voters squeezed by falling living standards and cuts to public
spending. Energy companies this week were criticized by the
industry watchdog for charging consumers too much.  Amazon.com Inc. was among three U.S. companies that last
year were singled out by U.K. lawmakers for not paying enough
tax in Britain. Members of Parliament’s Public Accounts
Committee criticized the online retailer, Starbucks Inc. and
Google Inc. for using complex accounting methods to reduce their
tax liabilities in the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
