The Caspian Pipeline Consortium
will in May increase daily crude shipments from the  Black Sea  by
5.1 percent from this month, a loading program obtained by
 Bloomberg News  showed.  The group, which operates the only oil export link in
 Russia  with foreign shareholders, will ship 2.845 million metric
tons, or about 713,000 barrels a day, according to the schedule.
That compares with 678,000 barrels in April.  CPC pipeline, in which Chevron Corp. is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from Kazakhstan’s western fields to a terminal near Russia’s
Novorossiysk port. Russia owns 31 percent and Kazakhstan 20.75
percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO Lukoil and a joint venture
between OAO Rosneft and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are among the
other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
