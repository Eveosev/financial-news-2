The Cyprus crisis won’t have a
“major impact on the overall landscape,” though  China  was
concerned about losses imposed on bank depositors as part of a
bailout of the Mediterranean island country, the Chinese
ambassador to the European Union said.  Wu Hailong said the EU’s handling of the Cypriot bailout
has “indeed attracted public attention.” China wonders if
depositor haircuts “will be reapplied in a future case,”
though the EU has given assurances that Cyprus isn’t a model, he
told reporters in Brussels today.  “I think the worst of the sovereign debt crisis is behind
us,” the ambassador said. “They are on the right track.”  China hopes that “transparency and non-exclusiveness” are
the basis for EU free-trade talks with the U.S. and  Japan , the
ambassador said. “We hope that these regional arrangements will
contribute to world economic growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
