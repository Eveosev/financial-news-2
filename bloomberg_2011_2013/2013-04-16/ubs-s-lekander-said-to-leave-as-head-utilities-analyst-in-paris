Per Lekander has left his role as
head of European utility research at the bank’s office in Paris,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Lekander, 50, departed on April 11, the person said,
declining to be identified because the information isn’t public.  The investment bank cut 25 jobs, a quarter of UBS
Securities France employees, L’Agefi reported on April 11,
citing Jean-Frederic de Leusse, the division’s chairman.  Ollie Gadney, a UBS spokesman in  London , declined to
comment by phone yesterday. Lekander didn’t respond to three
telephone calls and e-mails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
