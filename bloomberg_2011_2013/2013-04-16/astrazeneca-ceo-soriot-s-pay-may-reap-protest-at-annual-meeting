A U.K. pension group recommended
that members vote against drugmaker  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s
remuneration policy to protest a “golden hello” payment and
planned incentives for Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot.  The  Local Authority Pension Fund Forum , whose 57 public
sector pension fund members have more than 115 billion pounds
($176 billion) in assets, asked investors to oppose the pay plan
at AstraZeneca’s annual general meeting on April 25, it said in
a note to its members.  The fund forum is critical of Soriot’s “golden hello” of
991,000 pounds, which was compensation for his forfeited bonus
at  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , and 4 million pounds in shares that may be
given based on performance, it said. The pension investors in
the group own less than 2 percent of London-based AstraZeneca’s
shares, according to Tom Powdrill, a spokesman for the group.  Soriot became CEO in October, replacing  David Brennan , who
retired after several drug development setbacks. Soriot is to
receive 1.1 million pounds in base salary a year and his bonus
target is 100 percent of his salary, the company said Oct. 29.  “We are committed to levels of remuneration that are
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate senior employees of
the requisite quality, while avoiding paying more than is
necessary,” AstraZeneca said today in an e-mailed statement.
The company declined to comment specifically on the fund forum’s
advice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
