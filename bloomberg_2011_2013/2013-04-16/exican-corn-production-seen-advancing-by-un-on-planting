Corn production in  Mexico , the
second-biggest buyer of the grain from the U.S., may climb 2.6
percent from the previous year as planting expanded, the United
Nations’ Food & Agriculture Organization said.  Mexico may harvest 22.4 million metric tons of corn this
year, up from 21.836 million tons a year earlier, the Rome-based
agency said in a country  report  dated yesterday on its website.
Farmers have begun planting corn for the main spring-summer
crop, which accounts for 70 percent of the country’s total
output. The secondary autumn-winter crop, which is still being
harvested, may be 4.8 million tons, 10 percent smaller than a
year earlier because of frost damage in January, the FAO said.  Wheat production may be 3.75 million tons this year, 16
percent higher than in 2012 as planting rebounded and crops
experienced favorable weather, the FAO said. Farmers are
currently harvesting the country’s main autumn-winter wheat
crop, which represents 90 percent of national production.  Mexico’s grain imports in the 2012-13 marketing year that
began Oct. 1 may slide 12 percent from a year earlier to about
16 million tons, the FAO said. The country bought 9.54 million
tons of corn from the U.S. in the 2011-12 season, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates . Mexico’s U.S. wheat
 purchases  the same year were 3.5 million tons. It was the
second-biggest buyer of both grains from the U.S., after  Japan .  Corn  prices  in Mexico City in March were below year-earlier
levels, while costs of tortillas made of corn flour were
unchanged at a record 11.20 pesos (92 cents) a kilogram (2.2
pounds) achieved in February, the FAO said. Prices of black
beans were 13 percent lower than a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
