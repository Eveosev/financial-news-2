W.W. Grainger Inc. (GWW) , a Chicago-based
hardware-supply distributor, rose the most in more than eight
months after boosting the low end of the company’s prior 2013
profit and revenue forecast.  Grainger advanced 8.5 percent to $244.81 at 2:26 p.m. in
New York, the biggest  intraday  gain since July 18. The shares
had risen 12 percent this year through yesterday, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 8.8 percent.  The company, which plans e-commerce, enterprise and
distribution systems investments this year, expects sales growth
of a little as 5 percent, up from a prior forecast of a minimum
of 3 percent, according to a statement today. Grainger still
estimates top-end growth of 9 percent. Earnings per share will
be $11.30 to $12. A prior forecast had  estimated  $10.85 on the
lower end.  “Grainger is feeling a bit more optimistic about the
overall economy than they did five or six months ago,” said
Brent Rakers, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities Inc. in
 Memphis ,  Tennessee , who has a buy recommendation on the stock.  When you strip out the “holiday-related noise,”
Grainger’s core volume numbers have been stable, Rakers said.  Economic growth in the U.S., where Grainger gets about 77
percent of its sales, is expected to slow to 2 percent this year
from 2.2 percent in 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Still, Grainger raised its 2013 investment target to
$160 million from $135 million.  First-quarter net income rose 13 percent to $211.8 million,
or $2.94 per share, from $187.5 million, or $2.57, a year
earlier. Analysts had estimated $2.75. Sales rose 4 percent to
$2.28 billion, trailing analysts estimates of $2.31 billion, on
average.  The higher-than-forecast profit “starts with better margin
performance in the quarter,” Rakers said. “Some of the margin
improvement is just cost control by management.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
