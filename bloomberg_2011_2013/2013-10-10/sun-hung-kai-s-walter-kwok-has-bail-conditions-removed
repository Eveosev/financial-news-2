(Corrects Kwok’s title in third paragraph.)  Hong Kong’s Independent Commission
Against Corruption removed all conditions attached to the bail
of  Walter Kwok , the former chairman of  Sun Hung Kai Properties
Ltd. (16) , the company said.  The anti-graft agency made the change on Oct. 9, Sun Hung
Kai said in a filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange yesterday.  Kwok, a non-executive director of Hong Kong’s second-biggest developer by value, was released on bail in May 2012,
after being arrested as part of the probe of his brothers Thomas
and Raymond Kwok and the city’s former No.2 government official,
Rafael Hui.  Raymond and Thomas were granted cash bail of HK$10 million
($1.29 million) each last October and Hui’s bail was HK$500,000.
Walter, who is estranged from his younger brothers, had not been
charged.  Thomas and Raymond, sons of the developer’s late co-founder
Kwok Tak-seng, took over running Sun Hung Kai in May 2008 after
ousting their older brother from the chairmanship following a
court battle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
