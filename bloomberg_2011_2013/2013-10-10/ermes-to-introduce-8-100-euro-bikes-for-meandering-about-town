Hermes International SCA (RMS)  has a
solution for wealthy consumers seeking to beat the traffic or
meander about town.  The French maker of Birkin bags and silk scarves will
introduce next month its own range of handmade bicycles, it said
today in a presentation in Paris. Named Le Flaneur, or stroller,
and manufactured by bike maker Time, the eight-speed carbon
fiber machine weighs 11 kilos and comes in three colors and
sizes, all with leather-trimmed seats and handlebars.  Hermes and other luxury-goods makers are expanding beyond
fashion and accessories as they seek a greater share of the
wealthiest consumers’ wallets amid slowing industry growth.  LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , which owns 23.1 percent of
Hermes, added a pastry maker and a hotel earlier this this year,
while suitmaker Ermenegildo Zegna SpA is supplying fabric to
Fiat SpA Maseratis.  “We wanted to make a real bike that is easy to use,” said
Francois Dore, managing director of Hermes’s Horizons
department, which was created in 2011 to extend the company’s
upholstery activities to mobile objects.  The only barrier to parking it on the street could be the
price: 8,100 euros ($10,960).  To contact the reporter on this story:
