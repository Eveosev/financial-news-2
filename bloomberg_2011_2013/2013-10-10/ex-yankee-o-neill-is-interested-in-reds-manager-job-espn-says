Former New York Yankees and
Cincinnati Reds outfielder Paul O’Neill told  ESPN.com  he’s
interested in the Major League Baseball managerial vacancy in
Cincinnati, where Dusty Baker was fired a week ago.  “I would love to sit down and find out what their thoughts
are,” O’Neill, 50, was quoted as saying by ESPN. “It is not a
rebuilding situation. They are a very, very good team. I think
anybody would be interested in taking a good team and winning a
World Series.”  O’Neill told ESPN that he hasn’t talked with Reds owner Bob Castellini yet about the vacancy, though the two have talked
about “numerous things” in the organization in recent years.
O’Neill spent his first eight MLB seasons with the Reds from
1985 through 1992 before joining the Yankees, with whom he won
four World Series championships in nine years.  The Reds had a 90-72 record this season, finishing third in
the National League Central Division and making the postseason
as a wild-card before losing a one-game playoff to the
Pittsburgh Pirates. It was the third time in four years the Reds
reached the playoffs without advancing and Baker, 64, was fired
three days after the Oct. 1 loss.  O’Neill has no managerial experience and has spent parts of
the past 12 seasons as an analyst for the Yankees Entertainment
& Sports network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
