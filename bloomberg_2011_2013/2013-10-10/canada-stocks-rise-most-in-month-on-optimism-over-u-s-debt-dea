Canadian  stocks  rose the most in a
month as energy companies rallied amid signs that U.S. lawmakers
could reach an agreement to increase the debt ceiling and avoid
a default.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  and Suncor Energy Inc.
gained at least 1.2 percent as energy stocks surged. Twin Butte
Energy Ltd. jumped 6.4 percent after agreeing to buy Black Shire
Energy Inc. for C$358 million ($345 million). Royal Bank of
Canada, the nation’s largest lender, climbed 1 percent, headed
for a record high. Air Canada added 4.3 percent, headed for the
highest close in almost five years.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 124.71
points, or 1 percent, to 12,855.04 at 10:21 a.m. in Toronto. The
index is up 3.4 percent this year.  House Republican and Senate Democratic leaders in the U.S.
are open to an increase in the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling,
according to congressional aides. Both sides are weighing a
potential short-term increase in the debt limit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
