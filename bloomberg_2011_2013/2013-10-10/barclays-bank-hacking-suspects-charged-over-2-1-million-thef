London  police charged three more men
in connection with a 1.3 million pound ($2.1 million) cybercrime
attack on a  Barclays Plc (BARC)  branch in the capital.  The trio, including a former employee of the bank, were
charged yesterday with conspiracy to steal and were released on
bail. They will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on
October 15. Four other men were charged in the case last month.  The money was taken via the computer system of a Barclays
branch in north London in April, the Metropolitan Police said
last month. A man posing as an information technology engineer
had installed a device in the local branch that allowed the
group to remotely transfer money to accounts, the Met said at
the time. Barclays recovered a “significant amount” of the
stolen funds.  Banks face cyber-security threats from increasingly
sophisticated hackers trying to steal customer identities or
access funds. The Met said on Sept. 13 it detained twelve men
over an attempt to hack into  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  computers,
preventing a theft potentially worth millions of pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
