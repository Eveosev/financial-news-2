Renewable Energy Systems Ltd., a
U.K.-based clean-energy developer, sold 50 percent of a wind
farm in  Turkey  to STFA Yatirim Holding AS.  The Evrencik wind plant in Kirikkale in the Thrace region
has a capacity of 120 megawatts, according to a statement from
Pragma Corporate Finance, which advised RES on the deal. The
Hertfordshire, England-based company sold its share through its
RES Anatolia unit, Pragma said. Terms were not disclosed.  Turkey is seeking to boost renewable energy sources with
plans to get 30 percent of its energy mainly from wind and solar
power by 2023, according to the nation’s General Directorate for
Renewable Energy. Currently, renewable energy excluding
hydroelectric power generates 3 percent of Turkey’s energy, the
directorate said in June.  RES Anatolia and STFA, which provides services including
construction and natural gas distribution, signed an accord to
develop the plant in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
