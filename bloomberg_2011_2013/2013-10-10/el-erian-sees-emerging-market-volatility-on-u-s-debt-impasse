Pacific Investment Management Co.
Chief Executive Officer Mohamed El-Erian said developing nations
will remain volatile because of U.S. political turmoil.  “ Emerging markets  aren’t back to the old days,” El-Erian,
also co-chief investment officer of the Newport Beach,
California-based firm, said today at the 2013 Bretton Woods
Committee International Council Meeting in Washington. “When
you have the supplier of the global reserve currency, the
deepest, most predictive for financial markets, being subject to
the sort of political issues they are subject to today, you will
impart that instability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
