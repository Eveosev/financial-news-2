The fertilizer facility in  Texas 
that exploded earlier this year, killing 15 people, was cited
yesterday by the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
for 24 violations of worker safety protections and issued a
proposed fine of $118,300.  In April, a fire at the Adair Grain Inc. facility in the
town of West ignited ammonium nitrate stored there. The
resulting blast left a crater 93 feet by 10 feet. Adair was
cited for “serious safety violations” by OSHA for exposing
workers to explosion or fire hazards and for its unsafe handling
and storage of ammonium nitrate and anhydrous ammonia.  Before the blast, OSHA inspectors hadn’t been to the
fertilizer depot since February 1985.  The violations were disclosed by California Democratic
Senator Barbara Boxer today because the government shutdown
prevented the agency from making an announcement. The Labor
Department provided a copy of the complaint to  Bloomberg News 
today. The company can contest the violations and penalties.  “The attorneys are reviewing it,” said Daniel Keeney, a
spokesman for the company. “But they don’t believe these
allegations have anything to do with the accident in April.”  Federal inspectors visited the Texas plant after its April
explosion and found violations of safety regulations, including
failing to have appropriate fire extinguishers, poor respiratory
protection, combustible materials stored in bins that are not
fire resistant and the lack of a hazard communication plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
