China’s economy  may grow about 7
percent for the “foreseeable future,” Deputy Central Bank
Governor Yi Gang said during a panel discussion today in
Washington.  The economy has picked up in the third quarter and may
expand between 7.5 percent and 7.6 percent this year, Yi said.  “We have changed from very high-speed growth to medium- to
high-speed growth, which may be around 7 percent,” Yi said.
“By the world standard, it’s still high growth.”  While property prices remain high, Yi said China’s housing
market “bubble” and the local government debt problems are
“under control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
