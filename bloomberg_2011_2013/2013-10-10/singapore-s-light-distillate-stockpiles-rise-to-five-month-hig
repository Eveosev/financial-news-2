Light-distillate inventories rose
8.7 percent to the highest level in five months in  Singapore ,
Asia’s largest oil-trading and storage center, according to a
unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Onshore supplies including naphtha, reformate and gasoline
climbed by 907,000 barrels to 11.3 million in the week to
yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the highest since the week ended
May 1.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene fell by 1.1 million barrels, or 11 percent,
to 9.11 million, according to the data. Supplies dropped the
most in eight weeks.  Residual-fuel inventories, including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, declined by 128,000
barrels, or 0.6 percent, to 21.8 million, the data show.
Supplies slid for the third time in four weeks.  The ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude some
offshore storage capacity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
