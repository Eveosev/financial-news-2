Europeans unable to feed themselves
are increasingly seeking charitable services provided by the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies, according to a  report  by the Geneva-based group.  The number of people receiving food aid from IFRC
affiliates in 22 European countries increased 75 percent to 3.5
million over the past three years, the IFRC, which was
established in 1919, said in a  statement  today. In  France  more
than 350,000 people have fallen into poverty in recent years,
and in Latvia food aid has more than tripled, the group said.  “Millions of people’s lives have been thrown into turmoil
over the past five years and there seems to be a gradual
degradation,”  IFRC  Secretary General Bekele Geleta said in the
statement. The IFRC, a group of 187 national societies,
conducted surveys in 42 countries for the report.  The impact of the European economic crisis is also leading
more people to come to  Red Cross  or Red Crescent clinics and
centers asking for treatment, financial assistance to buy
medicines or help fill in forms for benefits, the group said.  “While we fully understand that governments need to save
money, we strongly advise against indiscriminate cuts in public
health and social welfare, as it may cost more in the long
run,” Geleta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
