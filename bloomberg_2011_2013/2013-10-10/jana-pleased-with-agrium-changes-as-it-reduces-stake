Activist investor Jana Partners LLC,
which demanded that  Canada ’s  Agrium Inc. (AGU)  separate its retail
unit, cut its stake in the company and said it’s “pleased”
with changes that have been made.  Jana said today in a filing its holding in Calgary-based
Agrium is 2.7 percent. The New York-based hedge fund had a 7.7
percent stake, according to a previous filing in June.  Jana first disclosed its shareholding in Agrium in August
2012. As well as separating the retail arm from the rest of the
company, which also produces fertilizers, Jana sought to replace
five of the company’s 11 directors with its own nominees. Agrium
investors rejected Jana’s nominees at an April meeting.  The fund said today it’s pleased with more capital being
returned to Agrium shareholders, the introduction of new metrics
measuring profitability of the retail business, and recent
management changes. Agrium said Oct. 2 that Chief Operating
Officer Chuck Magro will succeed Mike Wilson as chief executive
officer at the beginning of 2012.  Jana also said it still believes that an “unbiased
review” of Agrium’s structure “would benefit all investors. It
said it may continue to hold a stake and engage in talks with
Agrium management, board and investors to discuss the company’s
costs, controls, capital allocation, company structure and
corporate governance.  Agrium fell 1.3 percent to $82.40 in  New York . It has
dropped 15 percent since Aug 10, 2012, the last trading day
before the Wall Street Journal first reported Jana’s interest in
Agrium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
