Two members of Philadelphia Inquirer
owner Interstate General Media LLC sued the company and the
newspaper’s publisher over the ouster of editor-in-chief Bill Marimow.  Marimow, a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was fired
Oct. 7 without approval, H.F. “Gerry” Lenfest, a Pennsylvania
philanthropist, and former New Jersey Nets owner Lewis Katz said
in a complaint filed today in state court in Philadelphia.  Publisher  Robert Hall ’s “unauthorized action” promises to
have a “major injurious impact” on the company, according to
the complaint. Hall’s status as publisher is in question,
according to the filing. Marimow said he’s willing and able to
return to his position immediately, according to the complaint,
which seeks a court order declaring the firing null and void.  “Hall lacked the authority to fire the editor of the
newspaper, a major business decision that should not have been
-- and could not be -- taken without the unanimous approval of
the management committee,” according to the complaint.  Hall didn’t immediately return a phone message requesting
comment on the lawsuit.  The investor group bought the newspaper and its sister
publication, the Daily News, in April 2012 for $55 million.  The case is Intertrust GCN LP v. Interstate General Media
LLC, 131000654, Court of Common Pleas Philadelphia County
