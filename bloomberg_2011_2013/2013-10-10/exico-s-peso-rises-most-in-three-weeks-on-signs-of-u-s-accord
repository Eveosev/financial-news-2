Mexico ’s peso climbed the most in
three weeks as speculation mounted that lawmakers in  Washington 
will reach a deal to raise the U.S. debt limit, bolstering
demand for the Latin American country’s higher-yielding assets.  The currency rose 0.7 percent to 13.0982 per dollar at
10:15 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A close at that level would be the biggest daily
increase since Sept. 18. Today’s gain pared the peso’s loss this
year to 1.9 percent.  Emerging-market currencies rallied as U.S. House
Republicans met amid reports that they will consider a short-term increase to the U.S.’s debt limit without policy
conditions, potentially avoiding a showdown with President
 Barack Obama . The peso is advancing as meetings set for today
fuel speculation the two sides will reach a compromise before an
Oct. 17 deadline, according to Maya Hernandez, a strategist at
HSBC Holdings Plc.  “It’s the first sign of progress that we’ve seen in like
10 days,” Hernandez said in a telephone interview from New
York. “The market is hopeful that it will at least bring the
two sides closer.”  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due December 2024 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.01 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
