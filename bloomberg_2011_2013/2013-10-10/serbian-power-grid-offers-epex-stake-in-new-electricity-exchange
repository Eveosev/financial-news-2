Elektromreza Srbije,  Serbia ’s
national grid operator, offered Epex Spot SE a stake in Seepex,
a Balkan power exchange to be set up next year.  Paris-based Epex “is expected to respond by the end of the
year what stake they want to have in the company,” which will
be created in early 2014 and become operational in the third
quarter, Nikola Petrovic, Elektromreza general manager, said in
an interview in Belgrade today. EMS, as Elektromreza is known,
will hold a stake of at least 50 percent in the Belgrade-based
exchange.  The bourse will trade day-ahead and intra-day power for
Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro and may later couple with
neighboring Hungary and  Romania , Petrovic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
