Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
largest search engine, invested $103 million in a solar project
under construction in Southern California.  The 265.7-megawatt Imperial Valley Solar 1, being developed
by co-owner Silver Ridge Power LLC, will sell its power to
 Sempra Energy (SRE) ’s San Diego Gas & Electric Co. when completed next
year, Mountain View, California-based Google said today in a
statement.  The project is Google’s 13th investment in renewable
energy, the company said. It has invested more than $1 billion
in projects that will generate at least 2 gigawatts of
electricity, or enough to power 500,000 homes.  Silver Ridge is a joint venture between utility owner AES
Corp. and New York-based Riverstone Holdings LLC, a private-equity firm that invests mainly in North American energy assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
