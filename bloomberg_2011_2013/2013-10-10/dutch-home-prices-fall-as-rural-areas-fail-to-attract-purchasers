Dutch  home prices  fell in the third
quarter as properties in rural areas failed to attract buyers,
the NVM property brokers trade group said.  The average price dropped 0.6 percent to 205,000 euros
($277,020) in the third quarter from the previous three months,
according to calculations based on data compiled by NVM. Values
fell 3.6 percent from a year earlier.  “The drop in price has been relatively limited,” the
Nieuwegein-based group said in a statement today. “We expect
this trend to continue and the price drop to bottom further.”  Prime Minister  Mark Rutte ’s coalition government is trying
to revive a sluggish housing market while reining in home-loan
debt levels that are among  Europe ’s highest. The market’s
decline, triggered by the credit crisis and a deteriorating
economy, was aggravated by government measures restricting
mortgage-interest tax breaks and loan-to-value caps.  While conditions are improving in cities including
Amsterdam, Groningen and Leiden, demand in rural areas is still
weak, NVM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
