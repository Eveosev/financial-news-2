One passenger was killed and five
others were injured when a Twin Otter DHC6 plane operated by
 Malaysian Airline System Bhd. (MAS) ’s MASwings unit crash landed in
eastern Sabah state today.  The plane had a total of 16 passengers and crew on board,
the airline said in a statement. The aircraft, flying from Kota
Kinabalu, landed short of the runway in Kudat at 2:50 p.m. local
time and the cause of the accident is not yet known, it said.  This is the first fatal plane accident in  Malaysia  since
August 2009, according to AviationSafety Network. The pilot of
an  Avcen Jetpod  prototype was killed in that incident when the
plane crashed immediately after takeoff during its maiden
flight, according to the Network’s website.  Malaysian Air’s MASwings unit, started in October 2007,
operates commuter airline services in the states of Sabah and
Sarawak. The state-owned Malaysian Air in December ordered 36
turboprop planes for the MASwings and Firefly units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
