SKF AB (SKFB) , the world’s biggest maker of
bearings, rose the most in three weeks in Stockholm trading
after Nordea Bank AB said a return to growth will lead to record
earnings in 2015 and advised clients to buy the stock.  The  shares advanced  as much as 1 percent to 177.30 kronor,
their steepest increase since Sept. 19. The stock added 0.6
percent to 176.70 kronor as of 10:06 a.m. local time, valuing
the Gothenburg, Sweden-based company at 80.5 billion kronor
($12.4 billion) and taking this year’s advance to 8.2 percent.  Nordea upgraded its recommendation on SKF to buy from hold
today and increased its 12-month share price estimate to 200
kronor from 183 kronor. SKF’s cost-cutting program and the
company’s recent acquisition of Kaydon Corp. will help create
“very strong” earnings growth at SKF, suggesting record
earnings per share of 16.3 kronor in 2015, Nordea said.  “Recent trips to Germany and  China , plus macro indicators,
leave us confident in a clear return to growth for SKF,”
Andreas Koski and Andreas Brock, senior analysts at Nordea in
Stockholm, wrote in a note to clients.  SKF, which plans to report third-quarter earnings on Oct.
15, said on Jan. 14 it would seek to cut 3 billion kronor in
costs by the end of 2015 as production is moved from western
European countries to eastern  Europe ,  Asia  and  Latin America .  Of the 28 analysts that cover SKF and share their ratings
with Bloomberg,  29 percent  advise clients to buy SKF shares
while 43 percent have hold ratings and 29 percent advise clients
to sell the stock. The average share-price estimate is 181.4
kronor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
