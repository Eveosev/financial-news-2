Democratic Republic of Congo’s
economy will expand almost 2 percentage points below the 8.1
percent expected earlier because of slowing construction growth
and delayed mining output, the International Monetary Fund said.  The reduction to 6.2% from the initial figure isn’t a great
concern because economic data collection in the country is
inconsistent, Oscar Melhado, the IMF representative in Congo,
said in an interview today in Kinshasa, the capital.  The economy is expected to rebound next year thanks to the
mining industry, when the IMF projects an expansion of 10.5
percent, Melhado said.  Congo 11will be among the fastest-growing countries in sub-Saharan  Africa ,’’ he said.  The IMF originally expected 8.1 percent growth in 2013
after 7.2 percent in 2012. The economy is still growing faster
than the sub-Saharan African average, which was 4.9 percent in
2012 and will be an estimated 5 percent this year, according to
the IMF. Congo’s central bank said it was expecting 8 percent
growth on October 4.  Congo’s macroeconomic environment has stabilized in the
past few years, while its economy remains weak after four
decades of dictatorship and war, Melhado said. Inflation fell to
2.1 percent last year and will be about 4.4 percent this year,
according to the IMF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
