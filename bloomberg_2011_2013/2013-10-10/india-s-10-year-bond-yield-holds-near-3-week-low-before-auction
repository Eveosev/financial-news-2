India ’s 10-year government bond
yield held near a three-week low before a sale of 150 billion
rupees ($2.4 billion) of notes at a weekly auction tomorrow.  Securities due in a decade have climbed this week after the
Reserve Bank of India rolled back some of the emergency steps
taken since mid-July to shore up the rupee. Governor Raghuram
Rajan cut the  marginal standing facility  by 50 basis points to 9
percent on Oct. 7, the second reduction in less than a month. He
also lowered the bank rate to 9 percent, while keeping the
benchmark at 7.5 percent. The RBI will auction bonds tomorrow
with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2041.  “There are no immediate triggers in the offing,” Debendra Kumar Dash, a Mumbai-based fixed-income trader at Development
Credit Bank Ltd., said. “We’ve seen a good rally in bonds and
investors are awaiting cues from the auction. The yield should
hover around the 8.5 percent mark.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent sovereign bonds due May 2023
rose two basis points to 8.48 percent as of 10:12 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to prices from the central bank’s trading
system. The rate, which has dropped 13 basis points this week,
fell to 8.46 percent yesterday, the lowest since Sept. 20.  Indian bonds declined in each of the last four months, the
longest run of losses since 2009, as the RBI raised interest
rates and curbed funding support to banks to support the rupee.
The currency has rebounded 11 percent from a record low of
68.845 per dollar on Aug. 28.  Rajan unexpectedly raised the benchmark repurchase rate by
25 basis points on Sept. 20, the first increase since 2011, to
curb the fastest consumer-price increases among the four largest
 emerging markets . He also cut the marginal standing facility
rate to 9.5 percent from 10.25 percent the same day as part of
steps to ease cash supply.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , derivative contracts used to
guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis to
8.41 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
