Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said
the U.S. fiscal impasse is undermining the country’s credibility
around the world and bolstering the case of nations that want to
displace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.  “It’s no secret: There are discussions around the world
where others would like there to be a basket of currencies that
might be used as an alternative to the dollar,” Lew said in
testimony to the Senate Finance Committee today.  “The world actually counts on us being responsible,” he
said. “I met with finance ministers from  Africa  and with
finance ministers from  Latin America  and it’s challenging when
they look at you and they ask what’s going on in  Washington  --
it makes them nervous about their economies.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
