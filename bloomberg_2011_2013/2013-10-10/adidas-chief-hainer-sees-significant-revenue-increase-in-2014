Adidas AG (ADS)  Chief Executive Officer
 Herbert Hainer  expects a significant revenue increase next year,
boosted by sales of national team shirts and official balls for
the soccer  World Cup  in  Brazil .  The world’s second-largest maker of sporting goods is on
track to reach a target of 17 billion euros ($23 billion) in
annual revenue in 2015, spokeswoman Katja Schreiber said by
telephone, confirming Hainer’s comments to German newspaper
Handelsblatt. Analysts expect revenue to rise about 7 percent to
15.7 billion euros next year from 14.6 billion euros this year,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Nobody expects anything less than a significant revenue
increase next year,” said Joerg Philipp Frey, an analyst at
M.M. Warburg in Hamburg, by phone. “If they don’t have a
significant increase then it’s definitely a bad thing because it
would mean they have to review their guidance. It’s not really
spectacular.”  Adidas cut its 2013 profit forecast last month because of
Russian distribution difficulties, a weak golf market and the
strength of the euro. The company has been pushing product
categories including running and fitness this year because of
the lack of a major soccer event. Hainer said in June that
soccer sales will rise to a record 2 billion euros next year.  Adidas shares gained as much as 2.9 percent to 81.16 euros
and traded up 2.4 percent as of 5:16 p.m. in  Frankfurt .
Germany’s benchmark DAX Index rose 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
