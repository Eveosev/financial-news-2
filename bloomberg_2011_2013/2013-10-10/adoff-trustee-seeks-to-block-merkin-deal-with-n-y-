The trustee liquidating  Bernard Madoff ’s former firm asked a federal appeals court to block a
$410 million settlement between the state of New York and money
manager J.  Ezra Merkin .  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced the
settlement with Merkin, who controlled four funds that fed more
than $2.4 billion of investor money into Madoff’s fraud, in June
2012. Trustee Irving Picard tried to block the deal, claiming it
would hamper his efforts to collect assets for Madoff investors.  In arguments before the appeals court in Manhattan today,
David Sheehan, a lawyer for Picard, asked a three-judge panel 
to reverse lower court decisions permitting the settlement
to go forward.  Andrew Cuomo, New York’s former attorney general and now
the state’s governor, sued Merkin in 2009 claiming Merkin and
his Gabriel Capital Corp. defrauded investors, including
charities and educational institutions, by turning their money
over to Madoff without disclosing the con man’s role.  Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence after pleading guilty
to a fraud that wiped out $17 billion of customers’ principal.  The case is Picard v. Schneiderman, 13-01785, Second U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
