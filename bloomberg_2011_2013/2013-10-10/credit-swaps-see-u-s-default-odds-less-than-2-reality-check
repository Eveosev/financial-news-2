Credit derivatives traders are
pricing in less than a 2 percent chance U.S. lawmakers will tip
the world’s biggest borrower into default by failing to boost
the nation’s borrowing capacity.  Even after credit-default swaps protecting against losses
on Treasuries for one year doubled this month, they’re still
pricing in a 1.4 percent probability the government will fail to
meet its obligations, according to data provider CMA. The odds
implied by the contract are down from a peak of 1.7 percent
yesterday and up from 0.2 percent a month ago.  The swaps are declining amid signs lawmakers could reach an
agreement to increase the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling. Treasury
Secretary Jacob J. Lew has said Congress must increase borrowing
capacity by Oct. 17 or risk a default. House Republican leaders
are presenting their members with a proposal to raise limit for
six weeks without policy conditions and the proposal could come
up for a vote on the House floor as soon as tomorrow.  “People believe at the end of the day, the government will
do the right thing and make its debt payments,” Megan McClellan, head of U.S. fixed income at JPMorgan Private Bank,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview yesterday. The
government gridlock in 2011 taught investors “there will be a
last-minute deal,” she said. “The U.S. is not a credit-default
situation. We have plenty of money to pay our bills.”  Wagers Increase  The cost of one-year swaps on the U.S. government have
climbed to a mid-price of 53.5 basis points from 34 basis points
on Oct. 1 and reached as high as 84 yesterday, according to data
from CMA, which is owned by McGraw Hill Financial and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. The
default odds are based on a pricing model that assumes investors
would recover 40 cents on the dollar in a default.  The cheapest Treasuries that would likely be eligible to
determine payouts in any default have been trading at almost 83
cents on the dollar, Barclays Plc analysts wrote in an Oct. 9
report. That assumption changes the implied default probability
to 3.7 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Credit swaps, which investors use to hedge against losses
or to speculate on creditworthiness, pay the buyer face value if
a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt.  Wagers in all credit swaps tied to the U.S. government have
increased 12 percent during the past four weeks, according to
the  Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. , which runs a central
repository for the market. Banks,  hedge funds  and other money
managers had bought and sold credit swaps protecting a net $3.6
billion of U.S. government obligations as of Oct. 4.  That’s down from $3.7 billion a year ago and from $5.4
billion through Oct. 7, 2011, DTCC data show. There was a net
$17.2 billion outstanding of swaps tied to the debt of  Italy 
last week and $9.3 billion on  Spain .  Treasury Yields  Rates on Treasury bills maturing on the debt-ceiling
deadline eased today for the first time in six days. Rates on
notes due Oct. 17 declined 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage
point, to 0.31 percent. They were negative as recently as last
month. The securities are yielding more than the 0.174 percent
yield on the one-month London interbank offered rate.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  U.S. Treasury  note
increased 2 basis points to 2.68 percent, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. That’s down from the high this year of 3
percent on Sept. 6 and compares with the average of 3.53 percent
during the past decade.  Rate Derivatives  The U.S. two-year interest-rate  swap spread , a measure of
debt-market stress, rose 0.75 basis point to 13.38 basis points.
The gauge typically widens when investors seek the perceived
safety of  government securities  and narrows when they favor
assets such as corporate bonds. The measure, which reached a
2013 low of 11.88 on Oct. 8, has dropped from this year’s high
of 19.55 on June 21.  Credit  A gauge of U.S. company credit risk fell. The Markit CDX
North American Investment Grade  Index (SPX) , a credit-swaps benchmark,
dropped 4.6 basis points to a mid-price of 78.7 basis points,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The index has
averaged 81.8 basis points this year.  Currencies  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, rose 0.04 percent to 1,013.6. The
index has traded in a range of 1,054 and 1,008 the past six
months. The greenback gained 0.04 percent to 98.2 yen.  Stocks  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 2.2 percent to
1,692.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.2 percent to
15,126.  Volatility  The  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , or VIX, fell 16 percent to 16.48
after this week approaching its closing high for the year of
20.49 in June. That compares with a low of 11.3 in March.
Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index fell to 80.1, compared with the  average (INDU) 
this year is 72.4.  Currency swings as measured by the JPMorgan Global
Volatility Index fell to 8.64 versus a 2013 average of 9.38.  Energy, Commodities  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery
rose from a three-month low, climbing $1.40 to $103.01 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$1,296.90 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Prices dropped 2.1
percent last week amid speculation that the Federal shutdown
that has furloughed 800,000 workers would be short-lived.  Copper futures for delivery in December gained 0.54 percent
to $3.2485 a pound, rallying for the first time in four days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
