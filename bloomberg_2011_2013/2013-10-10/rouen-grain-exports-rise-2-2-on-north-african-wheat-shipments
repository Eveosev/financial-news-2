Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen, Europe’s biggest wheat-shipping hub, rose 2.2 percent
in the latest week as increased deliveries to Algeria and
 Morocco  made up for a decline in barley cargoes.  Total loadings for export gained to 145,646 metric tons in
the Oct. 3-9 period from 142,486 tons in the prior week, the
 Seine River port  wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Algeria was the biggest destination in the latest week,
taking 74,356 tons of soft wheat, from 31,000 tons previously.
Morocco took 27,500 tons of soft wheat, the first shipped to the
country since the third week of August, as well as 5,700 tons of
feed barley.  Wheat shipments climbed to 139,946 tons from 76,394 tons,
while barley deliveries fell to 5,700 tons from 66,092 tons as
cargoes to Saudi Arabia and  Peru  weren’t repeated.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s soft-wheat
exports in 2012-13, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the North Sea, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
