Boeing Co. (BA)  and South African Airways
are planning Africa’s first biofuel supply chain for commercial
aviation.  The two companies agreed to collaborate on programs to
ensure the availability of renewable fuel that will help reduce
the industry’s emissions, Chicago-based Boeing said today in a
statement.  “Sustainable aviation biofuel will play a central role in
reducing commercial aviation’s carbon emissions over the long
term, and we see tremendous potential for these fuels in
Africa,” Julie Felgar, head of Boeing’s commercial
environmental strategy and integration, said in the statement.  More than 1,500 commercial flights have used biofuels,
which emit less carbon dioxide than conventional fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
