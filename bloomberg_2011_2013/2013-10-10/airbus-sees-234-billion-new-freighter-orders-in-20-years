Airbus SAS (EAD)  said companies will order
about 870 new freighter planes valued at about $234 billion in
the next two decades, driven by cargo demand from Asia-Pacific.  That will boost the global freighter fleet to about 3,000
aircraft by 2032, Toulouse, France-based Airbus said in a
statement in Hong Kong today. Of this, 1,860 will be cargo
carriers converted from passenger aircraft.  The Asia-Pacific region is expected to account for 42
percent of the global airfreight traffic by 2032, with  China 
emerging as the biggest driver for air-cargo growth, Airbus
said. Airlines in countries from  India  to  Indonesia  are also
boosting passenger-plane orders as economic growth enables more
people to fly.  “Looking forward after a difficult few years, world trade
is showing improvements,” Andreas Hermann, the planemaker’s
head of freighters, said in the statement. “Diverse  emerging
markets  will call for increased flexibility in air cargo
transportation.”  Global air cargo traffic may increase 4.8 percent annually
over the next 20 years, Airbus said. Airfreight demand has
increased since April and climbed 3.6 percent in August as the
economies in the U.S. and Europe show some signs of recovery,
according to the  International Air Transport Association.   Airbus expects demand for mid-sized freighters will expand
amid the improvement in global trade and demand from China. The
number of such aircraft will probably increase to more than
1,290 by 2032 from 744 at the end of last year, it said.  Demand for small cargo planes is expected to increase to
more than 600 by 2032 from 380 last year, helped by a boom in
express freight in China and India. The fleet of large aircraft,
which represents about 32 percent of the current market, could
increase to over 1,000.  The A330 aircraft’s freighter model currently has orders
for 43, Hermann told reporters in  Hong Kong .  To contact the reporter on this story:
