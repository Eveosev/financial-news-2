URS Corp. (URS) , a U.S. engineering-advisory company, said the federal government’s shutdown forced
the furlough of about 3,000 employees and may spur more layoffs
if the impasse continues.  The total includes employees idled by the closing of a
government facility where they work or directives from U.S.
officials to halt operations or cut staffing, San Francisco-based URS said today in a statement.  “The government shutdown, the continuing effects of
sequestration and uncertainty about the  federal budget  are all
having negative impacts on URS and many other government
contractors,” Chief Financial Officer H. Thomas Hicks said in
the statement. “We hope the situation is resolved as soon as
possible to avoid additional impact on our federal business and
our employees.”  URS’s pullback showed the spreading effect on private
business from the partial closing of government operations that
began Oct. 1 with furloughs for about 800,000 federal workers.
The shutdown is draining an average of $160 million each workday
from the $15.7 trillion  U.S. economy , according to  IHS Inc. (IHS) , a
Lexington, Massachusetts-based global market-research firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
