Wilfried Martens, the most prolific
prime minister in  Belgium ’s history, died early today after a
long illness. He was 77.  Martens, from the Dutch-speaking northern region of
Flanders, presided over nine governments from 1979 to 1992,
deepening Belgium’s integration in the European Union while
leaving a legacy of debt that continues to burden the country.  From his campaign as a student activist for greater use of
the Dutch language at the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels, Martens
played a role in a series of constitutional reforms that handed
powers from the central government to the Dutch- and French-speaking regions.  “Belgium today has lost one of its most eminent
politicians and a true statesman,” current Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, the first French speaker to run Belgium since the
1970s, said in an e-mailed statement. “A convinced European, he
pursued to the utmost his commitment to achieving the European
ideal.”  Martens progressed from a Belgian political career to a
European one, serving a term in the European Parliament and
chairing the  European People’s Party  -- an umbrella group
uniting center-right parties -- from 1990 until his death.  Born on April 19, 1936 in Sleidinge in Flanders, Martens
studied law at the  Catholic University  of Leuven and worked five
years as a lawyer before entering politics.  Martens is survived by his third wife, fellow Flemish
politician Miet Smet. He had five children from two previous
marriages. Martens will be buried Oct. 19 in Ghent, the Belga
news agency reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
