Germany ’s housing and transport area
increased by 2.3 percent from 2009 to 2012, a pace of 74
hectares (183 acres) a day, equivalent to 106 football fields,
the country’s statistics office reported.  The area covered by housing and transport in  Europe ’s
largest economy rose by 1,087 square kilometers (420 square
miles) to 48,225 square kilometers at the end of 2012, or almost
14 percent of German land, Statistisches Bundesamt wrote in an
online  statement  today.  The pace of land-use conversion slowed from 81 hectares a
day in the 2008-2011 period, the office wrote. The German
government’s goal is to reduce the use of new land for housing
and transport purposes to an average 30 hectares a day by 2020.  Germany ranked behind  Spain  as the European Union country
that lost the most of its agricultural area to urbanization in
the period between 2000 and 2006, as the countries swapped
rankings from the decade before, according to  Eurostat data .  To contact the reporter on this story:
