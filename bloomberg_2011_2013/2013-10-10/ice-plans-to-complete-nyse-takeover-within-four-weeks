IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  said
it expects to complete its acquisition of  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  within
four weeks as the two exchanges press European regulators for
final approval.  IntercontinentalExchange plans to close the deal on Nov. 4,
the company said in a statement today. The 12-year-old energy
and commodity futures bourse, known as ICE, is buying the 220-year-old exchange operator as the profitability of equities
trading declines and derivatives generate more income.  The European Union approved the takeover on June 24 and
Atlanta-based ICE said Oct. 2 that a committee of European
regulators is “not minded to object” to the deal.  “The parties are now awaiting final approvals from the
national authorities and regulatory bodies in each of the
relevant European jurisdictions in order to complete the
transaction,” Peter Lenardos, an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets 
in  London , wrote in a note to investors. “Since key approvals
from the European Commission, the SEC and the Committee of
European Regulators have been received, we expect the
outstanding approvals to be granted and the deal to close as
indicated.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
