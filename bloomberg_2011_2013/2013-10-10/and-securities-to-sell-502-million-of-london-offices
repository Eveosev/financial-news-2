Land Securities Group Plc (LAND) , the
largest U.K. real estate investment trust by market value,
agreed to sell offices in London’s South Bank area to an M&G
Group Plc unit for 315 million pounds ($502 million).  M&G Real Estate will buy offices at Bankside 2 & 3 as well
as stores in Bankside 1, adjacent to the Tate Modern art gallery
on the south bank of the River Thames, Land Securities said in a
statement today. The buildings include 380,000 square feet
(35,303 square meters) of offices leased to  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc  until 2027 and 73,000 square feet of shops.  The development produced strong “returns for us since we
started on site in 2003, and selling it now fits our strategy of
recycling capital to re-invest,” Scott Parsons, Land
Securities’ head of  London  property, said in the statement.  Land Securities has been selling real estate and investing
in developments as London’s economy improves. More than 7.4
million square feet of central London office space was leased in
the first nine months of 2013, more than was leased in the whole
of 2012, broker Cushman & Wakefield Inc. said in a report last
month.  The deal will produce a 5.2 percent net initial yield,
according to the statement. Knight Frank LLP advised Land
Securities and Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. acted for M&G.  To contact the reporter on this story:
