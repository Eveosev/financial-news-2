Gasoline gained, outperforming crude
and diesel, as lower refinery margins and prices coupled with
seasonal maintenance may limit production.  Futures rose as much as 2.1 percent.  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Bayway
refinery in  New Jersey  and  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF) ’s Delaware refinery
are conducting planned work. Together the plants account for
420,000 barrels a day of capacity in the  New York  Harbor market.
Gasoline’s premium to  Brent crude , a rough measure of the profit
margin, has dropped to below $2 a barrel from more than $23 in
July. The fuel’s premium to West Texas Intermediate has shrunk
to about $10 a barrel from $26.29 in July.  “Negative margins will discourage gasoline production,”
said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at Energy Aspects
Ltd., a research company in London. “Prices are also too low to
encourage domestic production or imports. U.S. refinery runs
will fall and imports will fall.”  Gasoline for November delivery rose 3.55 cents to $2.6585 a
gallon at 9:34 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on
trading volume that was 21 percent above the 100-day average.
Prices have dropped 15 percent since Aug. 29.  Speculation that supplies will fall also boosted margins
today. The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened $1.53 to
$10.09 a barrel. The  premium  to Brent rose 44 cents to $1.54.  “The maintenance outages on the East Coast at Phillips 66
and PBF will reduce supplies of RBOB in the Harbor,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.3 cent to $3.351 a
gallon, 46.2 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA
said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery rose 1.56
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $3.033 a gallon on trading volume that
was 20 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  versus WTI widened 78 cents to $25.90 a
barrel. The  crack spread  over Brent fell 40 cents to $17.27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
