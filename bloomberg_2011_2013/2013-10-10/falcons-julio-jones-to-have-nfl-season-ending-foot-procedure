Julio Jones, who leads the  National
Football League  in receptions, will miss the remainder of the
season with a foot injury, the  Atlanta Falcons  said.  Jones, 24, got a second opinion yesterday after hurting his
right foot four days ago in a 30-28 loss to the New York Jets,
and will have a procedure Oct. 14.  “Julio’s appointment with the doctor today confirmed our
initial findings,” Falcons coach  Mike Smith  said yesterday in a
news release. “He is scheduled to have a season-ending
procedure on Monday.”  Smith didn’t divulge details of the wide receiver’s injury.
A scan showed that Jones, who had a fracture in his foot after
the 2011 scouting combine, broke the bone in the same place,
ESPN reported.  Jones, who had eight catches for 99 yards against the Jets,
has a league-high 41 catches for 580 yards, the second most in
the NFL. He made his first Pro Bowl team in 2012, when he had 79
receptions for 1,198 yards and 10 touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
