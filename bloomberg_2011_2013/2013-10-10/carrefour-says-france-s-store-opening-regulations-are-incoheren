Carrefour SA (CA) , France’s largest
retailer, said domestic restrictions on store opening hours are
incoherent after a Paris court ordered one of its franchised
shops shut after 1 p.m. Sunday and after 9 p.m. during the week.  Carrefour’s store in Paris’s Saint-Lazare railway station
serves more than 2,600 clients on Sundays and 300 clients after
9 p.m. on weekdays, showing it responds to strong consumer
demand, particularly from commuters, the Boulogne-Billancourt,
France-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  The court’s decision “shows again the incoherency of the
regulations,” said Carrefour, adding it supports its
franchisee’s appeal of the ruling, which has led to the loss of
nine jobs.  Carrefour joins  Kingfisher Plc (KGF) , owner of France’s biggest
home-improvement chain Castorama,  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA (MC) ’s Sephora and other retailers in protesting the laws
amid opposition from unions. A government-appointed committee is
studying the rules and will report back by the end of November.  Stores in France can open Sunday on the Champs Elysees
avenue in Paris, although not on other major boulevards which
have the largest department stores. Furniture and gardening
retailers can remain open, while do-it-yourself outlets can’t.
Some food stores can be open all day, others just the morning.
Family-owned neighborhood grocery stores aren’t affected by the
restrictions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
