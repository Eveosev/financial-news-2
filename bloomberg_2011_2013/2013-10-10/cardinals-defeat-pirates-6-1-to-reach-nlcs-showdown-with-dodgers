Adam Wainwright pitched the  St. Louis 
Cardinals into the National League Championship Series for the
third straight season by beating the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-1 in a
decisive Game 5 of their division playoff series.  Wainwright, who also was the winner in the opener of the
best-of-five series, allowed eight hits in his complete-game
victory. The Cardinals moved on to face the  Los Angeles Dodgers ,
who ousted the Atlanta Braves three games to one in their
division series.  At Busch Stadium in St. Louis, David Freese hit a two-run
homer in the second inning and Jon Jay gave the Cardinals a 3-0
lead in the sixth with a run-scoring single.  The Pirates used three consecutive infield singles to score
in the seventh, with Pedro Alvarez driving in the run.  The Cardinals added three runs in the eighth inning on a
two-run homer by Matt Adams and a run-scoring infield single by
Pete Kozma.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
