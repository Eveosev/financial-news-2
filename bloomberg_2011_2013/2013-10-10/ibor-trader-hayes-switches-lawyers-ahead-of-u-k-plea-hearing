Tom Hayes, the former UBS AG and
Citigroup Inc. trader who became the first individual to be
charged in the U.K. over the rigging of interest-rate
benchmarks, switched lawyers ahead of a plea hearing.  Hayes hired U.K. law firm Garstangs Burrows Bussin in place
of Fulcrum Chambers to advise him as he approaches the Oct. 21
hearing, Lydia Jonson, his former lawyer at Fulcrum Chambers in
 London , said in an e-mailed statement.  Hayes is charged with conspiring with employees of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , HSBC Holdings
Plc, Rabobank Groep and Deutsche Bank AG, as well as Tullett
Prebon Plc, ICAP Plc and RP Martin Holdings Ltd., over a four-year period to manipulate yen Libor rates.  He is scheduled to enter a plea at a court hearing this
month in London. Two former RP Martin brokers also charged with
manipulation of the London interbank offered rate will also
appear at the hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
