Acciona SA (ANA) , a renewable energy
company that’s built more than 70 desalination plants, will
deploy  Spain ’s first smart-water grid in the historic center of
the western city of Caceres to help detect underground leaks.  Acciona Agua, the water-services division of Alcobendas,
Spain-based Acciona, said today that the works are part of a 10
million-euro ($13.5 million) research project to manage drinking
water networks and cut costs and waste that includes the U.K.’s
Thames Water Utilities Ltd., Vitens NV of the Netherlands and
four demonstration sites across  Europe .  Software programs, remote meter readers and monitoring
sensors in the city center and old town that feature about 35
percent of Caceres will aid in managing drinking-water networks
and detecting leaks and pipe faults more quickly, Acciona said
in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
