U.S. Senator  John McCain  said he
plans to propose a slowdown in purchases of the Navy’s Littoral
Combat Ship, citing a Government Accountability Office report
that said the Pentagon is buying vessels faster than it can test
their design and performance.  McCain, an  Arizona  Republican on the Armed Services
Committee, told reporters after a Senate hearing today that he
will offer the plan as an amendment to the fiscal 2014 defense
policy bill when it comes to the Senate floor.  “We’ll be looking at ways of getting better
accountability,” McCain said.  Asked whether he had enough support from lawmakers for a
pause in the LCS program, McCain said: “I never gauge that, I
just do what’s right and we’ll see how it comes out.”  The $34 billion LCS program has faced questions about its
designs, firepower, defenses and survivability.  The Navy is buying two versions of the ship. One, with a
steel hull, is being made in Marinette, Wisconsin, by a group
led by  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  A group led by  Austal Ltd. (ASB)  is
building an aluminum trimaran in Mobile, Alabama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
