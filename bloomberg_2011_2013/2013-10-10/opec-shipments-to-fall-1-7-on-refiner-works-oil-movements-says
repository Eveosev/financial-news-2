The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will reduce shipments through October as
refiner demand drops in the northern hemisphere in autumn,
according to tanker tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil,
will curb shipments by 400,000 barrels a day, or 1.7 percent, to
23.73 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Oct. 26, the
researcher said today in a report. That compares with 24.13
million in the period to Sept. 28. The figures exclude two of
OPEC’s 12 members, Angola and  Ecuador .  “We’re heading toward a seasonal low point,”  Roy Mason ,
the company’s founder, said by phone from Halifax,  England .
“It’s the point at which western demand hits rock bottom and
eastern demand hasn’t yet made up for it.”  Refinery processing rates typically decline at the end of
the third quarter as plants perform maintenance before preparing
to meet higher demand for heating fuel during the northern
hemisphere winter.  Brent crude  was at $111.36 a barrel as of
4:16 p.m. today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London ,
having advanced 6.1 percent in the third quarter.  Middle Eastern shipments will fall 2.2 percent to 17.38
million barrels a day in the month to Oct. 26, versus 17.77
million in the previous period, according to Oil Movements.
Those figures include non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will increase 2.3 percent to 488.63
million barrels on Oct. 26, data from Oil Movements show. The
researcher calculates volumes by tallying tanker bookings, and
excludes crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It will next meet in Vienna on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
