Japan ’s  Topix (TPX)  index rose a third day
as the yen fell on signs U.S. lawmakers may strike a deal to
raise the debt ceiling and amid optimism the dollar will
strengthen after Federal Reserve minutes indicated tapering of
stimulus was likely this year.  Honda Motor Co., which gets almost half its sales in North
America, advanced 2.5 percent.  SoftBank (9984)  Corp. climbed 1 percent,
paring losses from the past two days. Rakuten Inc. slumped 2.6
percent after its equity rating was cut at Goldman, which said
the e-commerce company will have to review fees after  Yahoo
Japan Corp. (4689)  cut prices for online vendors. Fast Retailing Co.,
Asia’s largest clothing retailer, slipped 0.6 percent ahead of
an earnings report that showed its profit forecast missed
estimates.  The Topix rose 1 percent to 1,177.95 at the close in Tokyo,
with more than twice as many shares advancing for each that fell
on the 1,744-member gauge. Volume was about 18 percent below the
30-day average. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 1.1 percent
to 14,194.71.  “While there are still big concerns about the U.S. debt
ceiling out there, investors think it won’t be an issue in the
longer-term,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , who helps oversee the
equivalent of $5 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo. “The Fed tapering looks likely to come sooner than
expected, so I think the yen is at the tipping point of heading
toward a weaker level. It’s not Japanese shares you need to be
concerned about, so there’s relief there.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5
percent. The measure yesterday climbed 0.1 percent after
congressional aides said House Republican and Senate Democratic
leaders are open to a short-term increase in the debt limit, the
first movement toward averting a U.S. default. The U.S.
government is in the ninth day of a partial shutdown, just over
a week before U.S. borrowing authority lapses Oct. 17.  Fed Minutes  Most Federal Reserve policy makers said the central bank
was likely to taper its bond purchases this year.  “Most participants viewed their economic projections as
broadly consistent with a slowing in the pace of the committee’s
purchases of longer-term securities this year and the completion
of the program in mid-2014,” according to the record of the
Federal Open Market Committee’s Sept. 17-18 gathering.  The yen fell 0.4 percent to 97.76 per dollar today, after
rising to as much as 96.83 yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s
currency fell 0.2 percent to 131.92.  “Until we see the real signs of a breakthrough in the U.S.
congressional stalemate, gains may be sluggish,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “There’s a lot of expectations that
we’ll see Japanese companies revise up earnings. We’ll see
investors chase the upside.”  Exporters Advance  Honda gained 2.5 percent to 3,885 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,
Asia’s biggest carmaker, increased 1.9 percent to 6,350 yen.
Nintendo Co., a gaming console maker that counts the Americas as

support to the Nikkei 225. The shares yesterday fell 5.7 percent
after the mobile carrier’s rating was cut at Citigroup Inc.  Japanese machinery orders for August, an indicator of
future capital spending, rose 5.4 percent on the month, beating
the 2.5 percent estimate of economists’ surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fanuc Corp., which gets 40 percent of its revenue from
factory automation machinery, gained 2 percent to 16,010 yen,
the biggest boost to the Nikkei 225. Hitachi Construction
Machinery Co. added 1.4 percent to 2,119 yen.  Rakuten Drops  Among stocks that fell, Rakuten slumped 2.6 percent to
1,153 yen to cap an eight-day decline. The shares were cut to
neutral by Goldman Sachs, citing likely pressure on the online
mall after Yahoo Japan slashed fees for Internet retailers.  Fast Retailing (9983)  lost 0.6 percent to 34,550 yen, the biggest
drag on the Nikkei 225, ahead of an earnings release after the

for the year ending August 2014, missing the 99.3 billion yen
average estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings per share for companies on the Topix will rise 35
percent in the next 12 months, according to analyst  estimates
