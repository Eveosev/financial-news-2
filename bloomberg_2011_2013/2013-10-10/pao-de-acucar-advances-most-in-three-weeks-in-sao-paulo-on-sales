Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar ,  Brazil ’s biggest food retailer, rose the
most in three weeks after reporting that third-quarter sales
were the highest this year.  The shares climbed 3.4 percent to 108.60 reais at 1:11 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo . A close at that level would be the highest since
May 28. It was the best performer on the MSCI Brazil/Consumer
Staples Index, which gained 2.1 percent.  Sales increased 16 percent in the three months ended in
September to 14.1 billion reais ($6.5 billion), the retailer
said in a regulatory filing today on preliminary results for the
period. Revenue was 13.4 billion reais in the previous two
quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The preliminary sales number was very positive,”
Henrique Kleine, the head analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage
Magliano SA, said by phone. “We had been believing that with
the increase in salaries and purchasing power, Pao de Acucar
could benefit, and it has.”  Consumer confidence  rose for a second month in September,
rebounding from a four-year low in July, according to the
Getulio Vargas Foundation. Average personal income for
Brazilians rose 1.7 percent in August to 1,883 reais, the
national statistics agency said Sept. 26.  Pao de Acucar is scheduled to release its third-quarter
earnings report on Oct. 16, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
