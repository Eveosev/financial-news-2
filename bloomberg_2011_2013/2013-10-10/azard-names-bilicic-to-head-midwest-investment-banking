Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the largest independent
merger advisory firm, named George Bilicic to run its U.S.
Midwest investment-banking business, in addition to his role
leading power, energy and infrastructure globally.  Bilicic, 50, started the newly created position in August
and is based in  Chicago , he said today in a phone interview. He
reports to Antonio Weiss, global head of investment banking for
the Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm, and Chief Executive Officer
Ken Jacobs.  Bilicic said he plans to increase the number of employees
at the firm’s Chicago office, where David Kurtz, global head of
restructuring, and  David Solomon , who runs Lazard Middle Market,
are based.  “Lazard’s business model globally is to have very strong,
local, substantive relationships,” Bilicic said. “We can bring
this deep industry expertise and global perspective to clients
in the region.”  Bilicic joined Lazard in New York in 2002 from Merrill
Lynch & Co. He left in 2008 to run infrastructure at KKR & Co.,
the buyout firm led by Henry Kravis and  George Roberts , and
returned six months later to oversee the group that serves
power, utility and infrastructure clients. Earlier, he was a
partner in the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, which he joined
in 1989.  He is a graduate of DeSales University in Center Valley,
 Pennsylvania , and Georgetown University Law Center. Bilicic’s
new role was reported earlier today by Crain’s Chicago Business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
