Rubber dropped from the highest
level in more than a week after oil in  New York  traded near a
three-month low, cutting the appeal of the commodity as an
alternative to synthetic products.  The contract for March delivery on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange lost 2 percent to 259.4 yen a kilogram ($2,642 a metric
ton), retreating from yesterday’s settlement that was the
highest since Sept. 30. The most-active contract lost 14 percent
this year.  West Texas Intermediate traded near the lowest settlement
since July 3 after a government report showed U.S. crude
inventories grew the most in a year. U.S. politicians remained
deadlocked over raising the government’s borrowing limit, adding
to concern that the country will not meet its debt obligations.  “The turmoil sapped investor appetite for commodities,”
said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp.
in Tokyo. “Rubber tracked losses in oil and metals amid concern
the government shutdown may slow the U.S. recovery.”  The U.S. shutdown has interrupted the flow of government
data the Fed uses to evaluate the health of the economy, from
factory orders to trade and unemployment. It also threatens to
curtail economic growth after as many as 800,000 government
workers were furloughed.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 1.2 percent to 20,300  yuan  ($3,319) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board fell 0.3 percent to 79.25 baht ($2.52) a
kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
