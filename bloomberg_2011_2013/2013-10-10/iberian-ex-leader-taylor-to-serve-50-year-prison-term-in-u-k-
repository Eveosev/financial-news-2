Former Liberian President Charles Taylor is to be transferred to a U.K. prison to serve his 50-year sentence for crimes against humanity in  Sierra Leone ’s
civil war in the 1990s.  Taylor, 65, was found guilty last year on 11 counts,
including terrorism, murder, rape and using child soldiers, by
the Special Court for Sierra Leone in the Netherlands. The judge
at Taylor’s trial said he sold diamonds for and supplied weapons
and fighters to the Revolutionary United Front rebels, who
hacked off the hands and legs of civilians during the war in
Sierra Leone, Liberia’s neighbor, in which 50,000 people died.  U.K. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said in a  written
statement to Parliament  in  London  today that following a request
from the court, Taylor will now be moved to a prison in Britain.  “International justice is central to foreign policy,”
Wright wrote. “The conviction of  Charles Taylor  is a landmark
moment for international justice. It clearly demonstrates that
those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that, no
matter their position, they will not enjoy impunity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
