World Bank President Jim Yong Kim
said the  Federal Reserve ’s decision to delay its tapering of
monthly bond purchases creates an opportunity for developing
nations to pursue fiscal reforms ahead of increases in  interest
rates .  “We want to send the clearest possible message: Now is the
time to move,” Kim said at a press conference in Washington.
 Emerging markets  “have a two or three months’ window” before
the Fed starts scaling back its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases.  “Now is the time to make those reforms that you need to
make, making sure you are focusing on fiscal policy and fiscal
policy reforms that you need to make,” he said.  Kim said central banks worldwide are in “new territory,”
and any withdrawal of stimulus needs to be gradual.  Kim also said the impasse between the  U.S. Congress  and
President Barack Obama over raising the government’s borrowing
limit may harm developing nations’ economies and markets.  A “near miss” over raising the U.S. debt ceiling in 2011
increased borrowing costs and pushed down stock prices in
developing countries for months, Kim said. Again this time,
“even a near miss will have a real impact on developing
countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
