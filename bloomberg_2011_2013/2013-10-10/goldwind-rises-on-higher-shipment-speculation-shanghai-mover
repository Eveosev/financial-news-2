Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. (002202) ,  China ’s biggest wind-turbine maker, rose to a
17-month high in Shenzhen on speculation of higher shipments.  It rose by the daily limit of 10 percent and ended the day
up 5.6 percent at 7.79  yuan , the highest close since May 2012.
The Shenzhen Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.7 percent.  “The market is speculating the company will have higher
shipments in the second half,” Demi Zhu, a Beijing-based
analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said today by phone.
“Also Chinese turbine producers currently see an increase of
about 6 percent in price from the average in the first half.”  Goldwind in August forecast profit will jump as much as
fivefold in the first nine months on higher sales and cost cuts.
