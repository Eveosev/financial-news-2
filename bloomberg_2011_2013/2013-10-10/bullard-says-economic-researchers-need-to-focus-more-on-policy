Federal Reserve Bank of  St. Louis 
President  James Bullard , a voter on policy this year who has
backed record stimulus, said researchers in economics need to
focus more on challenges faced by policy makers, including
responses to the financial crisis.  Research “has become especially important in the past few
years, as the Fed and central banks around the world have
struggled to devise appropriate policy responses to the current
macroeconomic situation,” Bullard said today in the text of
remarks for a speech in St. Louis.  “We need to understand both how fundamental mechanisms in
the economy operate as well as how current data can be
interpreted in terms of fundamental theory,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
