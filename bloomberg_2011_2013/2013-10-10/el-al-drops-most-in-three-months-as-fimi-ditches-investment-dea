El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. (ELAL)  declined
the most in almost three months after Fimi Opportunity Funds
decided to back out of an investment of as much as $75 million
for a stake in the country’s flagship carrier.  The stock plunged 7.6 percent, the most since July 14, to
0.535 shekel at 2:46 p.m. in Tel Aviv, with volume surging to
5.6 times the three-month average. El Al said it was notified by
Fimi that the agreement was canceled after terms weren’t met,
according to a bourse filing. In April, when the deal was
announced, El Al said it was subject to the renegotiation of the
carrier’s employee contracts.  The airline is struggling to boost profitability amid
increasing competition after  posting losses  in four of the last
five years. In February, El Al said it would cut 200 temporary
jobs to trim costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
