BT Group Plc (BT/A)  will resell services
from EE, the biggest U.K. mobile-phone provider, to offer
wireless access to its customers and employees, ending a
partnership with  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)   BT, the biggest fixed-line phone company in the U.K., will
provide mobile services to corporate customers and government
workers via EE under a multi-year exclusive partnership, the
companies said in a statement today.  The London-based company sought bids for a new mobile
partner earlier this year after winning spectrum for carrying 4G
mobile-phone signals in the U.K.’s auction, making it the only
fixed-line provider to win rights to the airwaves.  BT’s previous partnership agreement with Vodafone for
consumer and enterprise service and handsets was worth a little
more than 10 million pounds ($16 million) a year, a person
familiar with the details said in April.  EE is a joint venture of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  Orange SA. (ORA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
