Crude oil options volatility fell as
futures jumped on speculation that the U.S. will avoid default
even as the government shutdown is in its tenth day.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value,
fell to 19.77 percent at 3:40 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  from 21.43 percent yesterday.  “Volatility has been falling because the risk of default
has gone down and oil started to rally a little with stocks,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
 Chicago .  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose
$1.46, or 1.4 percent, to $102.89 a barrel on the Nymex.  The White House endorsed a short debt-limit increase with
no policy conditions attached, signaling potential support for
House Republicans’ plan for a month-long reprieve. The idea,
proposed today by House Speaker  John Boehner , wouldn’t end the
partial shutdown of the federal government. The plan would push
the lapse of U.S. borrowing authority to Nov. 22 from Oct. 17.  Puts accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading volume
today.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
