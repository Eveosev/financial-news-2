Beijing Enterprises Holdings Ltd. (392) ,
controlled by the city government of China’s capital, cut the
amount it will pay for its parent’s stake in  China Gas Holdings
Ltd. (384)  by 10 percent to reflect a drop in the target’s share
price.  Beijing Enterprises Holdings will pay Beijing Enterprises
Group HK$7.4 billion ($954 million), or HK$7.02 a share, for a
22 percent stake in China Gas, according to a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing yesterday. The company previously promised to
pay HK$8.22 billion, or HK$7.80 a share.  The company said the new deal terms are “fair and
reasonable” given the prevailing market price of China Gas’s
shares. It didn’t elaborate. The supplier of natural gas to 184
Chinese cities has fallen 5.8 percent to HK$8.40 in Hong Kong
trading since Beijing Enterprises Holdings disclosed the planned
investment on July 30.  Beijing Enterprises said it will reduce the number of new
shares it will issue to the parent as payment to 98.1 million
from 113.1 million, leaving the cash payment unchanged. In July,
the company said it would pay HK$2 billion in cash.  Following the transaction, Beijing Enterprises Holdings
will be the biggest shareholder in China Gas, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The parent increased its stake in China
Gas last year after  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386)  and  ENN
Energy Holdings Ltd. (2688)  made a takeover offer for China Gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
