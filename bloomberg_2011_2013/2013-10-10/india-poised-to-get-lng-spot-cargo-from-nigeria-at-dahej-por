India , Asia’s fourth-largest buyer
of liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a spot cargo from
Nigeria, ship-tracking data show.  The Catalunya Spirit, with a capacity of about 135,000
cubic meters, will arrive Oct. 25 at Dahej port in western
India, according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. The vessel loaded the supercooled gas at Nigeria LNG
Ltd.’s Bonny Island terminal and departed Oct. 4.  India has no long-term contracts to buy LNG from the West
African nation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG) , India’s largest buyer of the fuel, owns a
processing facility at Dahej in Gujarat state with a capacity of
10 million metric tons a year, the company’s website show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
