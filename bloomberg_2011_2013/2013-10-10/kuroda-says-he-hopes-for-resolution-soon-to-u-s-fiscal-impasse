Bank of  Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he wants the earliest possible resolution to the
U.S. fiscal deadlock, which he said threatens to harm economies
worldwide.  A protracted stalemate on discussions to reopen the U.S.
government and raise the debt ceiling may damp economic
sentiment at a time when a “steadily improving” U.S. economy
is contributing to global growth, he said to reporters in
Washington today. That would be “undesirable,” he said.  When asked about Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen’s nomination to the central bank’s top post, Kuroda said
Yellen is “a very wonderful, capable person.” He declined to
comment on the policy implications of a Yellen-led Fed.  The global economy will probably accelerate next year, even
though some downside risks remain, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
