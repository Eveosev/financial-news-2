The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in Asia from non-payment declined, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1 basis point to 149 basis points
as of 9:01 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest close
since Sept. 26, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index lost 0.5 of a basis point to
95.8 as of 9:59 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
index is headed for a 1.9 basis-point rise this week, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index gained 1 basis point to
121.5 basis points as of 11:51 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The index is on course to rise 2.5
basis points this week, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
