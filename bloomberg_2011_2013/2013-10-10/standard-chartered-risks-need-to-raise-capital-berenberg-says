Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.
bank that gets more than three quarters of earnings in Asia, may
need to raise $6 billion of capital if it continues to pursue
its revenue target, analysts at Berenberg Bank said.  The bank will need to raise the funds to keep its core Tier
1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, above 12
percent and maintain a buffer beyond international standards,
analysts led by James Chappell wrote in a note to clients
yesterday. A spokesman for the London-based bank declined to
comment.  Growth of 10 percent is the bank’s “aspiration” though it
probably won’t be achieved this year, the company said in
August. To avoid the need to raise funds, the bank should focus
instead on return on equity, a measure of profitability, rather
than revenue or earnings growth, the analysts said. The lender
raised about 3.3 billion-pounds ($5.3 billion) in a share sale
in 2010.  “We do not believe that Standard Chartered can grow in a
similar way to before without increasing volatility and risk in
the business due to its size,” wrote the analysts with a sell
rating on the stock. “We are not bothered if Standard Chartered
loses market share.”  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Simone Meier  To contact the reporter on this story:
