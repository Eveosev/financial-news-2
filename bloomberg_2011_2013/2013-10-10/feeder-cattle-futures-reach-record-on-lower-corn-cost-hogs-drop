Feeder-cattle futures rose to a
record as the falling price of corn increased profit prospects
for U.S. ranchers who raise the animals before selling them to
meat processors. Hog prices fell.  Corn futures in Chicago have tumbled 37 percent this year,
the biggest drop among the 24 commodities tracked by the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index. The grain is a main
ingredient in livestock feed. Cash prices for cattle were $3 to
$5 higher than a week earlier, according to Anderson County
Livestock Auction in Elkhart,  Texas .  “The price of corn is the main factor” driving the feeder
market,  Lane Broadbent , vice president of KIS Futures Inc. in
 Oklahoma City , Oklahoma, said in a telephone interview. “The
cash market is incredible.”  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement rose 0.6
percent to $1.67425 a pound at 11:14 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price touched an all-time high
of $1.676.  Feedlot operators typically buy 1-year-old cattle that
weigh 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders,
which are fattened on corn until they weigh 1,300 pounds and are
sold to meatpackers.  Cattle futures for December delivery increased 0.2 percent
to $1.32175 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for December settlement declined 0.3 percent to
86.3 cents a pound. Prices dropped 1.9 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
