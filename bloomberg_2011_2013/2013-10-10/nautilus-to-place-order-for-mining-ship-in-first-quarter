Nautilus Minerals Inc. (NUS) , the Toronto-based company that won the first lease to mine the ocean floor
for gold and copper, expects to place an order for a vessel that
will separate ore from seawater in the first quarter.  The company has quotes ranging from $180 million to $260
million for the ship, Chief Financial Officer Shontel Norgate,
said during a call with investors today. The vessel will take
two to three years to build, depending on which shipyard gets
the order, she said.  “We’ll firm that up more over the next couple of months,”
Norgate said. Nautilus plans to  use tracked robots  to cut ore
from the sea floor and pump it up to the surface ship. The
vessel will remove water from ore pumped up from the ocean floor
and transfer the mineral to a transport ship.  Nautilus won leasing rights in January 2011 from the
government of  Papua New Guinea  to explore for gold and copper
off the nation’s coast. The company has an agreement to supply
ore to  Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co. (000630) , a Chinese copper
refiner.  Nautilus is open to funding the vessel with partners or
paying for it alone, Norgate said. The company would pay 20
percent to 30 percent of the cost through equity and the rest
would be debt-financed, she said.  “We want to get the best mix of cost, schedule and risk
mitigation,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Johnston said
during the call.  Nautilus gained 2.2 percent to 47 Canadian cents at 3:55
p.m. in Toronto. The stock has climbed 33 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
