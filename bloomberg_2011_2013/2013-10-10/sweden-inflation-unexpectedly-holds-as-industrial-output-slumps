Sweden’s  inflation  was little
changed in September and industrial production slumped, cooling
bets on interest rate increases in the largest Nordic economy.  Consumer prices rose an annual 0.1 percent, the same as in
the prior month,  Statistics Sweden  said today. They were seen
rising 0.2 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of 14
economists. Prices rose 0.4 percent  in the month .  Adjusted for
mortgage costs , gains slowed to an annual 0.9 percent from 1.2
percent. They rose 0.4 percent in the month.  The Riksbank kept its repo rate at 1 percent last month, in
part to avoid fueling household debt, and predicted it would
raise rates late next year. At the same time, inflation has
trailed the bank’s 2 percent target for 21 months.  Underlying inflation will stay under target until 2016 as
raw material, energy and food prices keep a lid on price gains,
said Olle Holmgren, an analyst at SEB AB in  Stockholm , before
the report. The Riksbank won’t be able to raise interest rates
until late next year, he predicted.  A separate report showed industrial production unexpectedly
fell 2.3 percent in August.  The krona slid 0.5 percent to 8.7853 per euro as of 9:45
a.m. in Stockholm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
