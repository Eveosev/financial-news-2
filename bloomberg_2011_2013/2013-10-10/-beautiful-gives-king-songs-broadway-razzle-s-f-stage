Jesse Mueller is a knockout as singer/songwriter Carole King in “Beautiful,” the Broadway-bound musical biography that opened Tuesday in  San Francisco .  Crucially, in the music and the singing, the show delivers the goods. That includes a big dose of nostalgia given King’s astonishing catalog of pop songs, from “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?” to “Up on the Roof” and “You’ve Got a Friend.”  We first meet Carole Klein in 1958 as a precocious 16-year-old Queens College freshman living with her divorced mother in  Brooklyn  and trying to sell her songs to Tin Pan Alley.  Producer Don Kirshner (Jeb Brown) shows an interest in the kid’s work. Gerry Goffin (Jake Epstein), a college classmate and lyricist, becomes her songwriting partner and then her husband.  At their office near Times Square, Goffin and the newly renamed King churned out one hit after another for Kirshner and the mostly girl groups in his stable.  Outfitted in Alejo Vietti’s brightly amusing period costumes (shiny gray suits for the Drifters, sparkly peach cocktail dresses for the Shirelles) the high-energy cast performs with zest and irony-free charm.  Down the hall from the team were Barry Mann (Jarrod Spector) and Cynthia Weil (Anika Larsen), another young songwriting couple who become friends and rivals. They’re represented with “On Broadway” and “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling,” among others.  Bitter End  By Act II in the mid-1960s, the tone shifts as singers who write their own songs, like  Bob Dylan  and the Beatles, start to remake the music business. King and Goffin move with their daughters to the New Jersey suburbs. Goffin chases other women and eventually King divorces him.  The last scenes find King performing on her own, first at the Bitter End in  Greenwich Village  and eventually at  Carnegie Hall  after the 1971 release of “Tapestry” makes her a star in her own right.  The biographical snippets between the songs are exposition that tell more than they show. Yet the production (with book by Douglas McGrath and direction by Marc Bruni) is redeemed by the sheer exuberance of the music. What’s not to like about “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” or the title number, one of those ultimate feel-good songs?  “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” runs through Oct. 20 at the Curran Theatre, 445 Geary St., San Francisco.

Rating: ****  Christopher Durang  Across the bay at  Berkeley Repertory Theatre , there’s “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike,” Christopher Durang’s clever mash-up of Chekhov.  Last season’s Tony winner for best play stars Anthony Fusco as Vanya and Sharon Lockwood as his sister Sonia, both leading bored and frustrated lives in a country house in Bucks County,  Pennsylvania . It’s owned by their sister Masha (Lorri Holt), a B-list actress, who’s gone through five husbands and arrives with her hunky young boyfriend, Spike (Mark Junek).  Throw in Cassandra, the soothsaying housekeeper who warns of impending doom, and Nina, the young cutie from next door who catches Spike’s attention, for a very funny mix. (Even if Spike’s strip-tease act is egregiously over-the-top).  “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike” runs through Oct. 25 at Berkeley Repertory Theatre, 2025 Addison St., Berkeley.
