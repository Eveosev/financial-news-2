European central banks sold 5.1
metric tons of gold in the fourth year of an accord that
originated in 1999, the lowest on record, according to data from
the World Gold Council.  Germany  sold 5 tons and an unidentified bank disposed 0.1
ton in the year through Sept. 26, the cpuncil, a London-based
producer-funded group, said in a report on its website. That’s
the lowest annual total since European central banks agreed to
limit sales in September 1999. Germany’s Bundesbank sells a
small amount each year to mint coins.  Central banks, which own 18 percent of all the gold ever
mined, will add as much as 350 tons valued at about $15 billion
this year, the council estimates. They purchased 535 tons in
2012, the most since 1964. Gold fell to a 20-year low in August
1999 as  Switzerland ,  Netherlands ,  Austria  and U.K. prepared to
sell gold. Gold rose from 2001 through 2012.  “Back in the early 2000’s, this agreement was seen as a
real key support for the market,” said Matthew Turner, an
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London. “Now it seems a bit
superfluous.”  Gold, which entered a  bear market  in April, slid 22 percent
this year to $1,302.80 an ounce by 12:28 p.m. in London. The
metal set a record $1,921.15 an ounce in September 2011.  Bullion sales under the current agreement total 200.50 tons
since the third five-year agreement started in September 2009,
according to the council. Central banks have sold 4,084.50 tons
since the first agreement, and failed to reached the allowed
limit each year since 2003, its data show.  “Central banks have lost their appetite for seling gold,”
said James Murray, a spokesman for the council. “Gold remains a
hugely important part of their portfolios and this has been the
case for the past few years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
