Smithfield Foods Inc., the world’s
largest hog producer, said it will reduce the use of a feed
additive that makes pork leaner as it seeks to win more business
in  China .  The U.S. company, acquired by Hong Kong-based Shuanghui
International Holdings Ltd. in a $4.7 billion deal last month,
has the capacity to ship “large quantities” of ractopamine-free pork to China, Chief Executive Officer C. Larry Pope said
in an interview yesterday in Hong Kong. China bans the use of
the additive.  Smithfield’s takeover by Shuanghui, the largest Chinese
purchase of a U.S. company, will “certainly boost exports” to
the Asian nation, Shuanghui Chairman Wan Long said in the same
interview. Shuanghui will promote Smithfield products and brands
to Chinese consumers, Wan said.  Wan also said the company had “no specific plan” for a
stock exchange listing.  About 40 percent of Smithfield’s production is ractopamine-free, Pope said. “We have the ability to expand that,” he
said.  While Smithfield’s exports to China have been mostly offal,
parts shunned by U.S. consumers, the company will boost exports
of higher-priced cuts of meat, Pope said. ‘  “The merger’s objective is to go beyond the offal into the
muscle meat,” he said, adding that the company has been selling
prime cuts to Shuanghui for nearly a year.  The purchase drew criticism from some U.S. lawmakers who
raised concerns that it may transfer food-safety issues from
China to the U.S. The bid for Smithfield underscores the
increased demand for meat, particularly pork, from China’s
expanding middle class.  To contact the reporter on this story:
