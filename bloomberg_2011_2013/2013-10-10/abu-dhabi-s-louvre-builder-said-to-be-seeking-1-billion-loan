Tourism Development & Investment
Co., the Abu Dhabi-owned developer of the Louvre and Guggenheim
museums, is talking to lenders for a $1 billion loan to replace
an existing facility, two bankers familiar with the plan said.  Banks have been asked to submit pricing for the deal to
replace a $600 million three-year loan maturing in December, the
bankers said, asking not to be identified because the
information is private. The company is seeking to pay less than
the 1.35 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered
Rate it pays on the current loan, one of the bankers said.  TDIC is building local branches of the Paris and  New York 
museums on Saadiyat Island, which is being developed as part of
the  United Arab Emirates ’ push to diversify its economy from
oil. The $27 billion worth of projects on the island include the
Zayed National Museum and a New York University campus. The
company is also building homes and offices.  An Abu Dhabi-based spokesman for TDIC, who asked not to be
identified because of company policy, declined to comment.  TDIC is one of four Abu Dhabi-government owned companies
whose debt carries a sovereign guarantee, facilitating
fundraising, according to one of the bankers.  Abu Dhabi , the
richest and biggest of seven states that make up the United Arab
Emirates, holds about 6 percent of global oil reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
