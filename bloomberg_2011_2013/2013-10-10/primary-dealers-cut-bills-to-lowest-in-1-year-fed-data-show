The 21 primary dealers that serve as
counterparties to the Federal Reserve in its open market
operations cut their  holdings  of Treasury bills to $16.2 billion
for the week ended Oct. 2, the lowest since October 2012.  The cumulative short-term bill position of the dealers,
including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and
Barclays Plc, fell by $3.4 billion, or 17 percent, from a week
earlier, central bank data show. The holdings are down from
$53.5 billion as of Sept. 11 and are at the lowest level since
Oct. 31, 2012, the data show.  The rates for all bills maturing through Nov. 14 fell have
risen since the partial shutdown of the government began Oct. 1,
raising the prospect that the impasse about spending plans would
extend to negotiations about raising the U.S. debt ceiling,
which the Treasury Department forecasts will be reached Oct. 17.  “You just want to lighten up on those positions,” said
James Caron, who manages money in New York at Morgan Stanley
Investment Management, which oversees $62 billion in fixed-income assets. “You don’t want to be overly exposed.”  Rates on Treasury bills due on Oct. 17 fell 17 basis
points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 0.31 percent, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield touched 0.51 percent
earlier, the highest level since they were sold in October 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
