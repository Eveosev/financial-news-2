Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA) ,  John Malone ’s
holding company, purchased a 5.2 percent stake of its own stock
from Comcast Corp. as part of a reshuffling of the billionaire’s
assets.  Comcast received $417 million in cash, a newly created
subsidiary of Liberty Media that holds Leisure Arts Inc., and
Liberty Media’s rights to a revenue-sharing agreement relating
to the carriage of CNBC, according to a statement today from
Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty Media.  The company also said it plans to sell $500 million of
 Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI)  shares to the satellite-radio company,
which boosted its stock-buyback plan by $2 billion. Liberty
Media said it will own more than 52 percent of New York-based
Sirius after the transaction.  Separately,  Liberty Interactive Corp. (LINTA) , another Malone
holding, will split into two tracking stocks. One will be called
QVC Group and the other Liberty Digital Commerce, the company
said in a statement.  Liberty Media shares rose 3.3 percent to $148.08 at 10:05
a.m. in  New York . The stock had climbed 32 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
