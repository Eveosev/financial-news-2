Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc. ,
 North America ’s largest fertilizer producer, cut its profit
forecast after customers deferred purchases amid predictions
that prices for the crop nutrient will slump.  Third-quarter earnings will be about 41 cents a share, the
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based company said today in a statement.
In July, it predicted profit of 45 to 60 cents. The average of
27 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for 47 cents,
excluding one-time items.  “The change primarily reflects lower-than-foretasted
potash sales volumes late in the quarter as buyers continued to
defer significant purchases amidst near-term market
uncertainty,” the company said in the statement.  The global potash market was shaken at the end of July
after OAO Uralkali, the world’s largest producer, exited a
trading joint venture with its Belarussian rival. The Russian
company said it would boost output and start selling at lower
prices, a move that sent shares of fertilizer companies plunging
around the world.  Uralkali CEO Vladislav Baumgertner said at the time that
the price of potash, which helps strengthen plant roots and
improve resistance to drought, may fall to less than $300 a ton
as his company moves to full production to gain market share.
The last reported potash supply agreement between the Uralkali-Belarussin venture and  China  was at $400 a ton.  Potash Corp. dropped 2.8 percent to $30.85 at 7:03 p.m. in
 New York  after the end of regular trading. The company is
scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
