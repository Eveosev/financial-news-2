Slovakia’s  Finance Ministry  stuck to
a decision to scale back an earlier plan on cutting its 2014
budget  deficit  so it can boost growth while still keeping the
shortfall under the European Union limit.  The proposed spending plan projects a fiscal deficit of
2.83 percent of gross domestic product next year, compared with
a 2013 target of 2.9 percent, according to a  draft  e-mailed from
the Finance Ministry before a cabinet meeting today. The gap is
set to narrow to 2.57 percent of GDP in 2015 and 1.5 percent of
GDP a year later, it said.  The euro-area member has relaxed its plan to trim the
deficit more in 2014, as further spending cuts could harm
flagging growth. Scaling back an earlier plan to cut the
shortfall to 2.6 percent of GDP, the government wants to stay
below the EU’s 3 percent ceiling to differentiate itself from
ailing members of the currency bloc it joined in 2009.  “We want to keep the commitment of the  budget deficit 
below the limit,” Fico said at a news conference in Bratislava.
“At the same time people want to have better  living standards .
We are trying to achieve the best balance between these two
goals.”  The budget is based on an assumption of economic  growth 
accelerating to 2.2 percent next year from a projected 0.8
percent in 2013, as domestic demand is set to join exports in
driving the economy. The ministry also said the income-tax rate
for companies will fall by 1 percentage point to 22 percent.  Public Debt  Slovak 2023 bonds were yielding 2.66 percent, 79 basis
points more than German Bunds, and five basis points above
 Belgium . Slovak borrowing costs for 10 years have risen 30 basis
points since May 22 when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernake
said the central bank may phase out stimulus.  The 2014 central state deficit was projected at 2.5 billion
euros ($3.4 billion), compared with an estimate of 2.1 billion
euros this year. Public debt is set to increase to 54.3 percent
of GDP from 52.1 this year, before peaking at 56.8 percent in
2015, the draft said.  The cabinet will discuss the budget today, and it must be
approved by parliament, where Fico’s Smer party holds a
majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
