Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  will reap a
$1.4 billion windfall from its decision two years ago to accept
stock in  Seagate Technology Plc (STX)  as partial payment for selling
its computer hard-disk drive business.  Samsung sold the unit in April 2011 for $687.5 million in
cash and $687.5 million in stock. Since then Seagate’s shares
have more than doubled and Samsung agreed to sell part of the
stake back to the Dublin-based company.  Samsung exited its 22-year-old business making hard drives
to focus on consumer electronics, memory chips and medical
technology. The world’s biggest smartphone maker will sell back
32.7 million of its Seagate shares for $1.51 billion. It will
keep another 12.5 million shares, valued at $561 million based
on yesterday’s prices.  “It's good news for Samsung and a positive for the company
that may be reflected in the fourth-quarter result,” said Ahn Seong Ho, a Seoul-based analyst at Hanwha Investment &
Securities Co.  “Samsung’s key business now is mobile devices,
including smartphones and tablets.”  Nam Ki Yung, a spokesman for Samsung, declined to comment
on the potential profit.  Since selling the business, Samsung has become the world’s
biggest smartphone maker while Seagate shares have surged as it
regained its investment grade at  Fitch Ratings  and  Standard &
Poor’s .  Samsung began making hard-disk drives in 1989 and the
business was part of the company’s semiconductor unit, the
world’s largest. The company is also the biggest maker of
televisions.  Seagate offered 45.2 million  shares  in the 2011 deal, the
companies said at the time with an agreement to supply each
other with electronic-storage devices. The deal followed  Western
Digital Corp. (WDC) ’s agreement to buy  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) ’s storage
business.  Seh-Woong Jeong, Executive Vice President at the Systems
LSI division of Samsung, will remain a Seagate director after
the sale of the 9 percent stake, according to a BusinessWire
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
