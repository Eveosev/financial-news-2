Juventus Chairman Andrea Agnelli
said Serie A needs an overhaul to prevent  Italy ’s top soccer
clubs from losing players to teams in other countries.  Speaking at the Leaders in Football conference in  London ,
Agnelli said the Italian league was “the destination” for
international players 10 to 15 years ago. Now, Serie A clubs no
longer have the financial clout to keep their most attractive
signings.  “You can be attractive, but you also need to have economic
strength,” he said. “Italy is no longer a final destination,
but a transit destination.”  Agnelli, 37, cited lack of control of major sources of
income, including broadcast revenue, as a reason.  “Around 70 percent of our revenues are intermediated by
someone else,” he said. Broadcast rights for Serie A games are
negotiated centrally by the league.  Agnelli also sought to subdue talk of a revamp of European
club competitions, including the  Champions League , after
Galatasaray Chairman Unal Aysal said that 15 to 20 clubs are
conducting feasibility studies for a new format.  “I do not think the time has come,” Agnelli said. “We
are part of a system that works, and we are proud of being part
of that system.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
