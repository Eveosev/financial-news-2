Qatar’s Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al
Thani paid a world-record 5 million guineas ($8.3 million) for a
one-year-old female horse at the annual Tattersalls bloodstock
auction of  Europe ’s top young thoroughbreds.  The yearling filly, a daughter of 2001 Epsom Derby winner
Galileo, was the most expensive horse of any age sold at auction
in Europe, beating the 4.6 million guineas paid in 2006 for
Magical Romance, Newmarket, England-based Tattersalls said.  Nicolas de Watrigant, the agent who bought the filly on
behalf of Sheikh Joaan’s Al Shaqab Racing yesterday, said she’ll
be trained in  France  by 24-time champion trainer Andre Fabre.  “We bought her sister last year and we think she could be
special, we didn’t want to miss this one,” de Watrigant said in
comments on the Tattersalls  website . “We didn’t expect to pay
that sort of price, but Al Shaqab Racing is keen to invest.”  The guinea, which equates to 1 pound, 5 pence, was the unit
of currency often paid to artists and professionals and is
typically used for buying horses.  Sheikh Joaan, the son of the former Emir of Qatar, won the
Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, Europe’s richest horse race, four
days ago with Treve. The unbeaten filly’s victory allowed her to
emulate Zarkava’s 2008 feat of winning the French Oaks, Prix
Vermeille and Arc all in the same season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
