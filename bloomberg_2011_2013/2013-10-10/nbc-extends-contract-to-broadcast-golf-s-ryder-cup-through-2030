NBC Sports and the PGA of America
extended their U.S. television rights agreement for golf’s Ryder
Cup through 2030.  The current contract, which was last extended in 2005, was
set to expire after the 2014 events. NBC said in a statement
that today’s extension was the furthest-reaching television pact
in professional sports.  The biennial Ryder Cup, which is staged by the PGA of
America, pits 12-member teams of top U.S. and European golfers
in three-day, match-play competition. It has been aired by the
Comcast Corp.-owned network since 1991. Financial terms of the
extension, which also includes the Senior PGA Championship,
weren’t disclosed.  The extension comes two months after NBC and  Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN lost broadcast rights to the  U.S. Open  golf
tournament when  21st Century Fox Inc. (FOXA) ,  Rupert Murdoch ’s film and
television company, signed a 12-year agreement to televise the
annual Grand Slam event.  The Fox broadcast network and the new cable channel Fox
Sports 1 will carry the U.S. Open, the U.S. Women’s Open and
U.S. Senior Open championships from 2015 to 2026. NBC had aired
the U.S. Open for the past 19 years  “We’re excited to continue our longstanding relationship
with the PGA of America and renew the Ryder Cup, one of the most
prestigious properties in sports,” Mark Lazarus, chairman of
NBC Sports Group, said of the Ryder Cup agreement.  Europe defeated the U.S. in last year’s Ryder Cup 14 1/2 to
13 1/2 at Medinah Country Club in Medinah,  Illinois . The next
Ryder Cup is scheduled to be played Sept. 26-28 at the PGA
Centenary Course in Gleneagles, Scotland.  The 2016 Ryder Cup will be at Hazeltine National Golf Club
in Chaska, Minnesota, followed by 2018 at Le Golf National in
Versailles, France; and 2020 at Whistling Straits in Kohler,
 Wisconsin .  -- With assistance from Eben Novy-Williams in New York. Editor:
