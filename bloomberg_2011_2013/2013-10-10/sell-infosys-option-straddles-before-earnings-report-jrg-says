Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  will probably post
quarterly results in line with analyst estimates tomorrow,
disappointing buyers of options who bet the stock will swing 12
percent by month-end, according to  JRG Securities Ltd. (JRGS)   Traders who bought put and call  contracts  with strike
levels closest to Infosys’s share price yesterday, a wager known
as a straddle, will profit if the stock  moves  about 12 percent
by Oct. 31, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Anand Tandon, the
chief executive officer of Kochi-based brokerage JRG, recommends
selling those  contracts  because odds that the stock will swing
by that much are “extremely low.”  India ’s second-largest software company will probably say
 earnings  rose 11 percent from a year earlier to 26.4 billion
rupees ($424 million) in the quarter ended September, according
to the average of 38 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Infosys, which had the most-traded options among companies on
Indian exchanges yesterday, swung by an average 11 percent in
Mumbai after its last eight quarterly reports.  “We don’t expect earth-shattering results this time,”
Tandon said by phone.  Implied volatility , the key gauge of options prices, for
at-the-money contracts on Infosys will fall to 27 percent from
63 percent before this month’s expiry on Oct. 31, Tandon said.  October 3,100 calls on the stock traded at 196.55 rupees
yesterday, while October 3,100 puts cost 182.5 rupees. Infosys
shares closed at 3,109.85 rupees.  The stock added 0.3 percent to 3,118.8 rupees at 11:04
a.m., extending this year’s gain to 34 percent. The benchmark
S&P BSE Sensex has advanced 4 percent in 2013.  Trading in Infosys options  jumped  to 78,406 contracts
yesterday from the 20-day average of 9,677, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Puts give the right to sell a security for a
certain amount, called the strike price. Calls convey the right
to buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
