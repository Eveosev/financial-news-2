Polish lenders, led by Bank Pekao SA
and BRE Bank SA, jumped to the highest level in almost six years
after Moody’s Investors Service raised the outlook for the local
banking industry to stable.  The WIG-Banks index rose 4 percent to 8,093.08 by the close
in Warsaw, the highest level since December 2007. The WIG30
gauge of the country’s largest and most-traded stocks added 3.1
percent, the most among 94 global benchmarks tracked by
Bloomberg. Bank Pekao, the second-biggest  lender  in  Poland ,
increased 3.5 percent.  The upgrade from negative reflects “our expectation of a
recovery in economic growth and consequent stabilization in bank
profitability,” Moody’s analysts led by Irakli Pipia said in a
report today. A rebound will bring about a “recovery in
interest income, Polish banks’ main revenue source.”  Poland’s economy grew at an annual rate of 0.8 percent in
the second quarter as the euro area emerged from its longest
recession. The expansion will accelerate to 1.95 percent in the
last three months of this year and 2.5 percent in 2014,
Bloomberg surveys show.  The outlook also mirrors “the banks’ improved
capitalization, increased risk-absorption capacity and largely
self-sufficient funding profiles, which make the system
resilient to the persistently challenging conditions in
international wholesale markets,” according to Moody’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
