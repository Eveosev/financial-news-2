Russia ’s government bond yields rose
to the highest level in a month on concern supply will increase
after Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said he plans to meet the
borrowing target for this year. The ruble gained.  The yield on ruble-denominated benchmark debt due February
2027 climbed for a fourth day, advancing three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 7.72 percent. The currency
strengthened 0.3 percent against Bank Rossii’s target basket to
37.3433 by 6 p.m. in Moscow, when the central bank stops its
open market operations.  Siluanov said late yesterday in  New York  the ministry plans
to issue a net 435 billion rubles ($13.5 billion) to 440 billion
rubles of debt in the domestic market. It has raised 110.5
billion rubles in the first nine months. The proportion of
overseas borrowing may be increased to fund Russia’s budget
deficit from 2015, according to the ministry.  “We’re sliding on Siluanov’s comments,” Ivan Guminov, a
 money manager  at Ronin Trust Management Company, said in e-mailed comments. “The risk-on is only on external markets,
domestically we’re short on positives.”  Russia’s inflation rate at 6.1 percent in September
remained above the central bank’s target range of 5 percent to 6
percent, Morgan Stanley analysts Jacob Nell and Alina Slyusarchuk said in an e-mailed note. They now expect no cuts at
the rate-setting meeting on Oct. 14 compared with an earlier
forecast for a 25-basis-point reduction.  Given the inflation reading, “there’s little chance the
central bank will lower rates,” Guminov said.  The central bank has kept its key lending rates on hold for
12 straight months. Eight out of 22 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg  expect the refinancing rate  to be trimmed by 25 basis
points to 8 percent.  Brent crude , Russia’s chief export earner, rose 1.3 percent
to $110.47 per barrel in  London . An index of 20 emerging-market
currencies compiled by Bloomberg advanced 0.3 percent to
94.5740. The ruble appreciated 0.3 percent against the dollar to
32.2410 and gained 0.3 percent against the euro to 43.5885.  To contact the reporter on this story:
