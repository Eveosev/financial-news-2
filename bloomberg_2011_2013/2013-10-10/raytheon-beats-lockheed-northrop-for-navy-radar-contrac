Raytheon Co. (RTN)  beat out  Lockheed
Martin Corp. (LMT)  and  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  for a contract that
could be worth as much as $1.6 billion to design and build air
and missile defense radars for the Navy’s newest DDG-51
destroyers, the service announced today.  Raytheon was awarded a $386 million contract to build and
test engineering development models, with an option for
procurement of as many as nine radars that would bring the
contract’s total to $1.6 billion, the Navy said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
