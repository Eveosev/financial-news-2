Western Canadian Select oil
strengthened for a fourth day on the  spot market  on speculation
that the grade is rebounding from a seasonal slump in demand.  WCS, a heavy crude produced from oil-sands bitumen, gained
$1.10 a barrel to a $29.50 discount to U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate, said Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc. It was the
lowest discount in more than two weeks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Canadian grades weakened over the past two months because
of lower seasonal demand from U.S. refineries, increased
production in  Canada  and pipeline constraints. WCS reached a
discount of $34.50 a barrel, the lowest level since January, on
Oct. 4.  Refineries in PADD 2, or the U.S. Midwest, the major
importers of Canadian output, scaled back  operations  by 7.3
percentage points over the past four weeks to 86.5 percent of
capacity, U.S. Energy Information Administration data show.  Canadian oil-sands production is expected to grow by 10.5
percent this year to 1.99 million barrels a day, the Canadian
Association of Petroleum Producers said in June.  Syncrude, a light oil processed from oil-sands bitumen,
gained $1 a barrel to a $8.75 discount to WTI, NetEnergy said.
The grade had fallen to a $13.50 discount, the widest in 18
months, on Oct. 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
