West Texas Intermediate crude headed
for a fourth weekly loss in five. The  International Energy
Agency  forecast that non-OPEC supplies will surge next year by
the most since the 1970s.  Futures fell as much as 1.4 percent in  New York  and are
headed for a weekly loss of 2.1 percent. Producers outside the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will increase
output by a near-record 1.7 million barrels a day next year to
56.4 million, the IEA said today in its monthly market report.
Brent’s premium to WTI climbed to a four-month high as the
detention and release of  Libya ’s prime minister fanned concern
the country’s oil exports may face fresh disruptions.  “Prices dropped after the IEA published their monthly
forecast,” said  Hannes Loacker , an analyst at  Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI)  in Vienna. “If the IEA picture on the supply
side is correct, there is a real risk that Brent prices will
drop below $100 a barrel during 2014.”  WTI for November delivery slid as much as $1.46 to $101.55
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $101.76 as of 1:26 p.m. London time. The
volume of all futures traded was about 82 percent above the 100-day average.  IEA Report  Brent for November settlement dropped as much as 74 cents
to $111.06 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark crude’s premium to WTI widened
to as much as $10.01, the biggest spread since April 26.  The IEA also trimmed its forecast for global oil demand
growth in 2014. World fuel consumption will increase by 1.1
million barrels, or 1.2 percent, to 92 million barrels a day in
2014, according to its monthly market report.  WTI gained 1.4 percent yesterday amid optimism the impasse
in  Washington  on raising the U.S. debt ceiling and ending the
partial government shutdown will be resolved. House Speaker  John Boehner  and other Republican leaders met with the president to
discuss delaying the lapse in U.S. borrowing authority to Nov.
22 from Oct. 17 without attaching policy conditions. The debt-limit bill could be voted on as early as today.  The U.S. benchmark may advance next week as lawmakers near
an agreement, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Fourteen of
33 analysts and traders, or 42 percent, forecast crude will
increase through Oct. 18. Eleven respondents, or 33 percent,
predicted a decline and eight projected no change.  Libya Abduction  Libya’s Prime Minister Ali Zaidan was freed yesterday hours
after being held by the country’s anti-crime unit at a Tripoli
hotel. Militia violence, which has plagued the North African
nation since the capture and death of former leader  Muammar Qaddafi  in 2011, has intensified in recent months with groups
refusing to heed government calls to disband.  Protests have disrupted oil production and exports from
Libya, a member of the OPEC. Output fell to 300,000 barrels a
day in September, the least since the same month in 2011,
according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts and producers.  OPEC’s production in September dropped to the lowest level
in almost two years amid losses in Iraq and Libya, according to
the IEA. The group’s 12 members, responsible for 40 percent of
global crude supplies, pumped 29.99 million barrels a day last
month, the least since October 2011, the agency said in its
monthly report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
