Deborah Simon, daughter of the
founder of mall developer  Simon Property Group (SPG)  Inc., pledged
$100 million to Mercersburg Academy, a private high school in
 Pennsylvania .  The gift, intended to fund financial aid, faculty
development and facilities, matches the second-largest donation
to a U.S. private school, according to an e-mailed statement by
the school.  Simon is vice president of the board of regents at
Mercersburg, where she studied from 1972 through 1974. Her
father, Melvin Simon, was a founder of the Simon Property Group,
based in Indianapolis, the largest U.S. mall owner. Some of
Simon’s donation will be made through the Deborah Joy Simon
Foundation.  “We are thrilled beyond words for this transformational
gift and the confidence that Deborah and her foundation have
placed in us,” said Douglas Hale, head of school, in the
statement. “Because of their vision and generosity, young men
and women from all walks of life will have access to an
extraordinary education.”  Mercersburg, located about 100 miles from Baltimore, was
founded in 1893 and has 435 students, according to the
statement. Graduates of the boarding school, which also has day
students, include the late actor  Jimmy Stewart  and former U.S.
attorney general Richard Thornburgh.  In 2007, Barbara Dodd Anderson  pledged  $128 million to the
George School in Newtown, Pennsylvania, the largest gift to a
private school. In 1993, Walter Annenberg donated $100 million
to the Peddie School in Hightstown,  New Jersey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
