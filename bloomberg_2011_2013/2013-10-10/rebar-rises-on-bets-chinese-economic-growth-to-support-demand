Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  advanced on bets that China’s economic expansion will
continue to bolster demand for the building material.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained as much as 0.5 percent to 3,608 yuan ($589) a
metric ton before trading at 3,593 yuan at 10:57 a.m. local time.  The central bank may release reports on  money supply  and
new lending as early as today, while the customs office is
scheduled to provide foreign-trade data on Oct. 12.  “The overall economy is in a mild expansion stage after
the shaky start in the first half,” said Dang Man, an analyst
at Maike Futures Co. in Xi’an. “All the investments in railway
construction and Beijing’s looser attitude toward property
market curbs will continue to be the main drivers for rebar.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was little
changed yesterday at $131.80 a dry ton, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The average spot price of
rebar gained 0.3 percent yesterday to 3,501  yuan  a ton,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
