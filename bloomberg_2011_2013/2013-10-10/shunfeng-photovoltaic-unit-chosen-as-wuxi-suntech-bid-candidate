Jiangsu  Shunfeng Photovoltaic (1165) 
Technology Co., a unit of Shunfeng Photovoltaic International
Ltd., was chosen as a provisional candidate to invest in Wuxi
 Suntech Power (STP)  Co.  Its bid was preferred over that of state-owned Wuxi Guolian
Development (Group) Co. after the administrator of the main unit
of Suntech Power Holdings Co. evaluated the offerings, according
to a statement posted on the Wuxi municipal government website.  A final decision will be made after a restructuring plan is
approved by creditors, it said without stating when. Jiangsu
Shunfeng paid a deposit of 500 million yuan ($82 million), which
is refundable should the bid fail, its parent said yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
