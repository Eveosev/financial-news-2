Germany’s  10-year (USGG10YR)  government bonds
fell for a third day along with Treasuries as U.S. lawmakers
indicated they’re open to a short-term increase in the debt
ceiling, damping demand for the safest assets.  The German 10-year yield climbed to the highest level in
two weeks. Austrian, Belgian, Dutch and French securities also
declined.  Italy  sold 8.5 billion euros ($11.5 billion) of 365-day bills today, before an auction of as much as 6 billion euros
of bonds due between 2016 and 2028 tomorrow. Minutes from the
latest Federal Reserve meeting released yesterday showed most
policy makers said the central bank was likely to reduce the
pace of its bond purchases this year.  “Bunds and Treasuries are down on signs that there might
be some movement in the debt ceiling deadlock,” said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC Bank NV in Brussels. “We are
not convinced by this move as the U.S. situation is not solved.
Even with a solution, the U.S. data in the next few weeks will
not be so good and there might be uncertainties on whether the
Fed will taper in December.”  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield increased six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 1.87 percent at 4:24 p.m. London time
after reaching 1.88 percent, the  highest  since Sept. 24. The 2
percent security due in August 2023 fell 0.505, or 5.05 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.17.  Debt Ceiling  House Republican and Senate Democratic leaders in the U.S.
are open to a short-term increase in the $16.7 trillion debt
ceiling, according to congressional aides who spoke on condition
of anonymity. Economists say a failure by the world’s largest
borrower to repay its debt will devastate stock markets and
throw the U.S. and world economies into recession.  The U.S. government enters its 10th day of a partial
shutdown before its borrowing authority lapses Oct. 17.  Benchmark Treasury 10-year note yields rose five basis
points to 2.71 percent, after reaching 2.72 percent, the highest
since Sept. 23.  Italian bonds advanced as investors sought higher-yielding
securities.  HSBC Holdings Plc has added to its dollar-hedged positions
in Spanish and Italian bonds, Fredrik Nerbrand, HSBC’s London-based global head of asset allocation, wrote today in an e-mailed report.  “There are several reasons that an investment in  Europe 
currently appears attractive,” Nerbrand wrote. “The eurozone
is out of recession and the economic outlook has improved. At
the same time, in recent weeks several potentially testing
political obstacles have been successfully navigated, which
should reduce uncertainty.”  Yields Fall  Italian 10-year yields fell five basis points to 4.33
percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Spanish debt was
little changed at 4.34 percent.  Italy sold one-year bills at an average yield of 0.999
percent, compared with a rate of 1.34 percent at a previous
auction on Sept. 11.  The Rome-based Treasury last sold three-year notes on Sept.
12 at 2.72 percent, compared with 2.33 percent at a previous
auction on July 11. It allotted 15-year bonds last month at 4.88
percent, up from 4.67 percent at a prior sale on June 13.  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of France and  Austria ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  The yield on Austria’s 10-year bond increased five basis
points to 2.25 percent. French 10-year yields climbed four basis
points to 2.39 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity
Belgian bonds rose four basis points to 2.62 percent. The yield
on Dutch 10-year securities added five basis points to 2.24
percent.  German bonds lost 1.7 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish securities
returned 9.2 percent and Italy’s gained 4.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
