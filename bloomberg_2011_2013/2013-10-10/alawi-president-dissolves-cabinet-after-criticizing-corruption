Malawi President Joyce Banda
dismissed members of her cabinet today a day after she
criticized members of the government as being corrupt.  Banda will take over the duties of the ministries, her
office said in an e-mailed statement. She asked for help
yesterday from donors to investigate government officials after
arrests by the Anti-Corruption Bureau in the past month.  Banda, 63, became president last year after President Bingu wa Mutharika died. Wa Mutharika’s brother and allies of the
former president tried to prevent Banda, then vice president,
from assuming power. Wa Mutharika had alienated donors by
refusing to devalue the kwacha, leading to food and fuel
shortages.  She devalued the kwacha and raised fuel prices a month
after taking office, unlocking aid from international donors
like the U.K and the  International Monetary Fund . Aid accounts
for about 40 percent of the nation’s budget.  The Southern African nation is the world’s largest producer
of burley tobacco, a low grade variety of the crop. The economy
will expand 6.1 next year, faster than the 5 percent estimate
for this year, according to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
