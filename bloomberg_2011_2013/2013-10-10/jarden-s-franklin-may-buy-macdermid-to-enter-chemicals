Martin Franklin, who co-founded
consumer goods company  Jarden Corp. (JAH) , is in talks to buy
MacDermid Inc. to diversify into specialty chemicals used in
electronics and printing products.  The British-born entrepreneur would make the purchase
through London-listed investment company Platform Acquisition
Holdings, founded with Nicolas Bergruen. Discussions are
ongoing, Platform said in a statement today. Citing people
familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal earlier
reported that Franklin may pay $1.8 billion.  “A further announcement will be made in due course as
appropriate,” Platform said. Shares of the London-listed
company have been temporarily suspended until talks are
concluded or abandoned.  MacDermid is expected to be the first of a string of niche
chemical makers targeted by Franklin, the Journal reported. The
Denver-based chemical maker was bought out by management in
2007, and hired Lazard to explore sale options after a failed
attempt at an initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
