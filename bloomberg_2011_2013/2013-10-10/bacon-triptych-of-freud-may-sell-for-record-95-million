A Francis Bacon triptych of Lucian Freud may sell for more than $95 million at auction in New York next month, an artist record.  Bacon’s 1969 “Three Studies of Lucian Freud” is the most highly valued work in Christie’s International’s flagship sale of postwar and contemporary art on Nov. 12, the London-based auction house said today in an e-mailed release.  Christie’s estimate of $85 million at hammer prices would incur fees. According to Bloomberg calculations, the work, if sold, would be more expensive than the record $86.3 million with fees paid for a 1976 triptych by Bacon at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in New York at the height of the last art-market boom in May 2008.  Entered by an unidentified European seller, the trio of gilded-framed canvases, showing Bacon’s painter friend sitting on a wooden chair against an orange background, has never appeared on the auction market before, said Christie’s.  The work, one of only two existing, full-length triptychs of Freud, was included in the Bacon retrospective at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1971-72.  Recent record prices, such as the $119.9 million paid for Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” at Sotheby’s New York in May 2012, have encouraged owners to part with valuable works. Triptychs from the 1960s are Bacon’s most desirable paintings, dealers said.  “Three Studies of Lucian Freud” will be on show at Christie’s in  London  from Oct. 13 to Oct. 18 during Frieze Week.  Muse highlights include  Farah Nayeri  on art,  Catherine Hickley  on music,  Stephanie Green’s  Scene in D.C.,  Jason Harper  on cars,  Rich Jaroslovsky  on technology and  Amanda Gordon’s  Scene Last Night  To contact the writer on the story: Scott Reyburn in London at sreyburn@hotmail.com.
