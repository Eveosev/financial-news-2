Ukraine ’s winter-wheat area may be
as much as 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) smaller than
normal after excess rain in the past two months barred planting,
said Sergey Feofilov, general director of UkrAgroConsult.  Winter wheat may cover 6.5 million to 7 million hectares,
at least 700,000 hectares less than usual, Feofilov said today
at an interview at the European Commodities Exchange in Paris.
Winter varieties account for 95 percent of the country’s wheat
production, he said, adding that winter-rapeseed sowing may also
be 30 percent to 40 percent below normal because of rains.  “The best time for planting has already passed in key
wheat and rapeseed areas in Ukraine,” Feofilov said. “Next
year winter-wheat production will decline.”  Rainfall also delayed harvesting of summer crops.
 UkrAgroConsult , a Kiev-based researcher, cut its forecast this
month for the country’s sunflower production by 300,000 metric
tons to 10.1 million tons, Feofilov said. Output still will be
the highest on record.  Corn production may be a record 26 million to 27 million
tons, up from last year’s 20 million to 21 million tons, when
dry weather hurt crops, Feofilov said.  “The corn is rather wet this year because of the rain, so
this means large costs for farmers to cut and clean it up to
export quality,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
