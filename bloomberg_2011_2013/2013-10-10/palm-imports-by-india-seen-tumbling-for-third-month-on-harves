Palm oil imports by  India , the
world’s largest consumer, probably fell for the third month in
September as traders trimmed purchases before the start of the
main domestic oilseed harvest.  Shipments of  crude palm oil  and refined, bleached and
deodorized palmolein fell 22 percent to 650,000 metric tons from
833,917 tons a year earlier, according to the median of
estimates from five processors and brokers compiled by
Bloomberg. Imports, including for industrial use, fell 12
percent to 880,000 tons, the survey showed. The  Solvent
Extractors’ Association  of India will release data next week.  India is on the cusp of the biggest oilseed crop ever
because of a potential increase in output of soybeans and
peanuts, according to Atul Chaturvedi, chief executive officer
of Adani Wilmar Ltd. Increased domestic supplies may cut imports
and boost  palm oil  stockpiles in Indonesia and  Malaysia , the
biggest producers, amid a seasonal increase in output. World
stockpiles are seen at a record by the end of 2013-2014 as
production climbs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.  “We had less imports as the local crop is estimated to be
good and everyone was expecting the crop arrivals to start
early,” said Ashok Sethia,  executive director  at Sethia Oils
Ltd. and a former president of the association. “Because of
extended rains, harvest was delayed and the crop will arrive
within the next 10 days.”  Monsoon Boost  The monsoon oilseed crop is estimated to be 23.96 million
tons this year compared with 20.86 million tons a year earlier,
the  Agriculture Ministry  said on Sept. 24. The crop makes up
about 70 percent of the annual output. Farmers boosted planting
after the nation got the highest rainfall since 2007 during the
June-September monsoon season.  “Refined palm oil imports have come down on expectation
that the import duty would be raised by the government,”
Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of Sunvin Group, said
by phone from Mumbai.  Refined palmolein imports jumped 36 percent to 1.9 million
tons in the 10 months to August this year, compared with a 7
rise in crude palm oil purchases to 4.8 million tons during the
same period, according to the association. The government is
considering an industry demand to revise the tariff on refined
oils, Food Minister K.V. Thomas said Sept. 25. Processed oils
currently attract a duty of 7.5 percent, while crude oil is
taxed at 2.5 percent.  Monthly Loss  Palm for delivery in December climbed 0.9 percent to 2,391
ringgit ($749) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange in
 Kuala Lumpur  yesterday. Futures slid 3.5 percent in September,
the biggest monthly decline since July. Inventories rose 7
percent to 1.78 million tons last month from August, the highest
since May, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board yesterday.  India’s palm oil imports may increase 5 percent to 8.7
million tons in the year beginning Nov. 1 from 8.3 million tons
this year, said Govindlal G. Patel, managing partner at G Patel
& Nikhil Research Co., who has traded cooking oils for more than
three decades. The country meets more than half its cooking oil
demand through imports.  Vegetable oil purchases in the 10 months through August
rose 8 percent to 8.79 million tons, association data show.
Imports will surge to 10.6 million tons this year from 10.2
million tons a year earlier, Patel said.  Crude soybean oil  imports probably more than doubled to
150,000 tons in September from 59,000 tons a year earlier, while
 sunflower oil  purchases may have dropped to 50,000 tons from
80,000 tons, the survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
