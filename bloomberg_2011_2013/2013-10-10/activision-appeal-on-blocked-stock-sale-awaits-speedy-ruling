Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) , the
largest U.S. video-game publisher, might soon be able to
proceed with a $5.83 billion share buyback and planned sale of
$2.34 billion in company stock to insiders.  Following arguments in Dover today, the Delaware  Supreme
Court  said it may rule before an Oct.15 termination date
for the transaction, possibly this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
