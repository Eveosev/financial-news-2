The Wall Street Journal  reported  that  Sears Holdings Corp . has been selling off some of its most profitable locations to raise cash: As the Journal noted, this is hardly crippling. It’s also not a good sign. When a company starts liquidating its most profitable assets to raise cash, you have to wonder about the future. And Sears's future is already looking lackluster. Its profit margin has been negative, zero or pretty close to zero for years. Its debt-to-asset ratio is rising. Its stalwart appliance-and-tool business has attracted more competitors thanks to giants such as  Home Depot Inc .; like  J.C. Penney Co.,  its lower-middle-market consumer merchandise is being outcompeted by cheap-and-cheerful outlets such as those of Target Corp. That doesn’t leave much to get excited about. The sad fact is that liquidating profitable assets may be the best strategy for the company’s owners -- provided that managers return the money to shareholders in the form of dividends. If your market is in decline, it’s better to cash out than to ride it to the bottom. I suspect, however, that the money will be used to prop up the vast network of slowly declining mall locations. In which case, this is just a slightly novel way to go broke.
