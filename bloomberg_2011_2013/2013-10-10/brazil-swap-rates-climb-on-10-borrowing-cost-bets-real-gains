Brazil ’s swap rates rose the most in
six weeks amid speculation that benchmark borrowing costs will
reach 10 percent this year after policy makers signaled that
they will maintain the pace of increases.  The central bank yesterday lifted the target lending rate
by a half-percentage point for the fourth time in a row, setting
it at 9.5 percent. Swap rates rose after policy makers,
repeating language used in their August decision, said the
increase will ensure slower inflation next year. They have
raised the target rate 2.25 percentage points since April, the
longest stretch of increases in the world.  “People thought the central bank had some political
barrier that would prevent it from raising rates to two digits,
and the language yesterday made it very clear that this
impediment does not exist,” Thais Zara, the chief economist at
Rosenberg & Associates Inc. in  Sao Paulo , said by phone. “The
rates curve is now correcting this erroneous perception.”  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 rose 19
basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, to 10.28 percent at 9:41
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real gained for a second day,
appreciating 0.6 percent to 2.1936 per dollar.  The central bank’s next monetary policy meeting is
scheduled for Nov. 26-27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
