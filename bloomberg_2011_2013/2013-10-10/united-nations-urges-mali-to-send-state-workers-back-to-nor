Mali  needs to speed up the return of
state workers to the north, where French troops intervened to
prevent Islamist fighters from taking control of the country,
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said.  Insecurity remains a “serious concern” because of the
presence of armed groups and increase in inter-ethnic clashes,
Ban said in a  report  to the UN Security Council published today.
About 65 percent of health centers in the region aren’t
operating and half of the schools remain closed, he said.  “A significant number of state officials have yet to
return to their positions,” he said. The food and humanitarian
crisis  “is a further reminder of the systemic weaknesses that
have debilitated the Malian state and government in recent
years.”  Former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita was elected
president Aug. 11, more than a year after soldiers led a coup
because of the lack of support from the government to fight an
ethnic Touareg insurgency. At least half a million Malians fled
to the south or across the border as the conflict erupted in
January.  French President  Francois Hollande  sent in troops in
January to prevent Islamist rebels allied to al-Qaeda from
taking over the rest of the West African nation. The UN
peacekeeping force in Mali, known as Minusma, has 5,200 troops
deployed across the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
