FX Concepts LLC, the currency hedge
fund founded by John Taylor that was once the world’s largest,
will shutter its investment-management business.  “Assets at the firm have dropped to levels that can no
longer sustain the business,” Robert Savage, the chief
strategist at FX Concepts, said in an e-mailed statement. “The
board has concluded that it is in the best interest of the
firm’s investors to conduct an orderly wind-down of open
positions, close its funds and hand back any remaining mandates
to clients.”  The New York-based hedge fund’s assets under management
shrank to $661 million as of Sept. 26, from about $12 billion in
2009, according to data from the company’s investor website. The
San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System voted on Sept. 11 to
pull the more-than $450 million it had invested with FX
Concepts.  The closing of the company’s funds will take place over the
next couple of weeks, the 50-year-old Savage said in the
statement. FX Concepts will keep its newsletter and foreign-exchange overlay advisory businesses operating, he said.  Hedge funds that seek to profit on macro-economic events
trading anything from currencies to commodities have had
negative  returns  of 10 percent this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Volatility in the $5.3 trillion-a-day
foreign-exchange market rose in the first half of the year at
the fastest pace since Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed
in 2008, catching traders off guard and wiping out gains from
strategies such as the carry trade.  Fund Losses  FX Concepts’ flagship fund, the $619 million Global
Currency Program, had lost 13.9 percent in 2013 as of August,
according to a company report. The $16 million FX Concepts
Multi-Strategy Program declined 10.96 percent year-to-date
through August, company data show.  FX Concepts, which was founded in 1981 by Taylor and calls
itself one of the oldest currency-only hedge funds, saw its
Global Currency Program lose 3.11 percent in 2012 and 14.47
percent in 2011.  Taylor, 70, is attempting to sell a co-op he bought on  New
York  City’s Upper East Side in 2010 for $25 million, according
to a Sept. 13 report from The Real Deal. The purchase, which was
for $4.5 million more than the asking price, was funded with a
$20 million loan that was taken out from FX Concepts in June
2010, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
