Cocoa futures climbed to a 23-month
high in New York as European processing advanced, signaling
sustained demand. Sugar also rose, while orange juice, coffee
and cotton declined.  The European Cocoa Association said today that processing
rose 4.7 percent to 331,514 metric tons in the third quarter
from a year earlier, after gaining 6 percent in the previous
three months. The last time processing advanced for two straight
quarters was in 2011. Demand is rising as dry weather earlier in
the growing season may cut yields in Ivory Coast and  Ghana , the
world’s top two producers.  “Numbers like the 4.7 percent gain give me the impression
that cocoa demand is still good and on the rise,”  Hector Galvan , a senior commodities broker at RJO Futures in  Chicago ,
wrote in an e-mail. “All the issues continue to press on the
crop, such as yield kill from the heat stress it endured earlier
in the year.”  Cocoa for delivery in December gained 1 percent to settle
at $2,729 a ton at noon on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after
reaching $2,735, the highest for a most-active contract since
November 2011. The December contract may rise to $2,820, Galvan
said.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery increased 0.7 percent
to 18.72 cents a pound in New York.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery fell 1.3 percent
to $1.268 a pound on ICE. Cotton futures for December delivery
slid less than 0.1 percent to 83.17 cents a pound. Arabica-coffee futures for delivery in December declined 0.7 percent to
$1.144 a pound.  Fundamentals for arabica coffee will stay negative amid a
potential record crop in top grower  Brazil  in 2014 and a strong
rebound in Colombian production, the second-biggest supplier of
the variety, Judy Ganes-Chase, the president of J. Ganes
Consulting in  Panama  City, Panama, said in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
