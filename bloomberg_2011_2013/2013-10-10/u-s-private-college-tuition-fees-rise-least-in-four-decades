Tuition and fees at private, non-profit U.S. colleges rose 3.6 percent in 2013-2014, the smallest
increase in more than 40 years, as families struggle to afford
college costs.  The increase was the lowest since at least the 1972-1973
year, according to data published today by the  National
Association of Independent Colleges and Universities , collected
from 510 schools.  Curbing the cost of college has become an issue for
President  Barack Obama , who in August called for a new way to
link federal financial aid to a U.S. government rating system
looking at college expenses and performance. Cost increases had
declined to the mid-4 percent range over the past four years
compared with almost 6 percent a year during the previous
decade, according to the Washington trade group.  “During the past five years, private colleges and
universities across the nation have redoubled efforts and
implemented innovative initiatives to cut their operating costs,
improve their efficiency and enhance their affordability,”
David Warren, president of the group, said in a statement.  Published tuition and fees for the past academic year
averaged about $29,000 at nonprofit colleges and universities,
according to the  College Board .  To contact the reporter on this story:
