The  African Development Bank  agreed
to help finance a drinking-water project to supply 1.6 million
people in Mali’s capital Bamako, which has been suffering from a
shortage.  The loan approval will aid in funding project works to
produce 144,000 cubic meters of potable water a day to Bamako
and regulate the price of water at standpipes to boost access to
supplies for the poor, the Tunis-based bank said in a statement.  The water works and a related plan to build a sewage-treatment plant,  storage tanks  and an 880-kilometer (550-mile)
distribution network is part of a total project estimated to
cost $361 million that includes financing by the European Union
and  World Bank . The African development bank’s loan is for $75.5
million, it said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
