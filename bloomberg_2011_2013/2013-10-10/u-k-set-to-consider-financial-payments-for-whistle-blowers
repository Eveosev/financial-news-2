Whistle-blowers who unveil
corruption, bribery and fraud in the U.K. may be given financial
rewards, according to plans described in a government report.  Government departments will “consider the case for
incentivizing whistle blowing, including the provision of
financial incentives,” the U.K. Home Office said in an Oct. 7
paper on the creation of a new national crime fighting agency.
The American system, where whistle-blowers can get a share of
any fines levied, will be the basis for the review.  The plan was first reported by the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
