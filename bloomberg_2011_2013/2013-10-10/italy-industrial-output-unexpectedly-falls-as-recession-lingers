Italian industrial  output 
unexpectedly fell for a second month in August, a decline that
may extend the nation’s recession into a third year.  Production decreased 0.3 percent from July, when it dropped
a revised 1 percent, national statistics office  Istat  said in
 Rome  today. Economists had forecast a 0.6 percent rise,
according to the median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
Output fell 4.6 percent from a year earlier when adjusted for
working days.  The euro region’s third-biggest economy may still be mired
in the slump it entered two years ago as the sales abroad of the
country’s goods fail to offset the effect of rising  unemployment 
on domestic demand. Still, business and  consumer confidence  rose
last month to the highest since the second half of 2011 with
executives and  households  sharing the government’s optimism that
 Italy  will exit the slump by year-end.  Italy’s unemployment rate rose more than forecast in
August, returning to an all-time high of 12.2 percent reached in
May, Istat said Oct. 1.  Italy, whose economy went through four recessions since
2001, needs government stability to meet the budget and economic
targets agreed upon with the European Union. On Oct. 2 Prime
Minister Enrico Letta won a confidence vote in parliament after
former Premier  Silvio Berlusconi  threatened to bring down the
five-month old government.  Istat initially reported an industrial output decline of
1.1 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
