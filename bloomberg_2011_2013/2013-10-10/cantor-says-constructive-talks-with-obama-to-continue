House Republicans and President  Barack Obama  had a “constructive conversation” about the debt limit and the partial government shutdown, and discussions between the two sides are continuing, said House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor .  “The talks will continue tonight and hopefully we will have a clearer way, path forward,” he told reporters at the Capitol after the meeting at the White House.  “The president didn’t say yes, didn’t say no,” said House Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan , a Wisconsin Republican. “We’re continuing to negotiate this evening.”  House Speaker  John Boehner  and other party leaders met with the president for more than an hour at the White House to discuss delaying the lapse in U.S. borrowing authority to Nov. 22 to Oct. 17 without attaching policy conditions.  The proposal from Boehner could come up for a vote on the House floor as soon as tomorrow. The measure wouldn’t end the 10-day-old partial shutdown of the federal government, though Representative  Tom Cole  of Oklahoma said a bill to end the shutdown would be considered soon.  “I hope the Republicans decide what they want and we’ll be happy to work with them in any way,” Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  of Nevada said at the White House after he and other Senate Democrats met with Obama for almost two hours earlier today. “We’ll just wait and see because they cannot decide what they want.”  Obama has insisted that he will negotiate on broader fiscal and health-care issues only after a debt-limit increase is passed and the shutdown ends. Reid echoed that stance today, saying talks before the shutdown ends are “not going to happen.”  First Sign  Boehner’s plan marks the first sign that the parties may be able to resolve the impasse without the catastrophic economic consequences that the Treasury Department said would stem from a default.  It wouldn’t end the partisan budget fights that have led to fiscal brinkmanship at least four times since Republicans gained the House majority in January 2011.  Jay Carney , the White House press secretary, said today that Obama would support a short increase in the U.S. debt limit with no “partisan strings attached,” though he prefers a longer extension.  Carney said the White House would need to see a bill before accepting it.  Boehner, Republicans  Boehner and Republican leaders say they want to engage Obama in talks about the budget. Those conversations would start under an unwritten agreement that wouldn’t be part of the debt-limit measure, said Representative  Dave Camp , a Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.  The  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index rose 2.2 percent at 4 p.m. in New York for the biggest rally since Jan. 2, the day after lawmakers passed a bill that prevented tax increases and spending cuts.  The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.68 percent, after touching 2.72 percent, the highest level since Sept. 23. The rates for all Treasury bills maturing through Nov. 14 fell.  Cole, a Boehner ally, said the shutdown could be “settled pretty quickly” after the debt-limit bill passes. He wouldn’t say whether Republicans would insist on changes to Obama’s health law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  ‘Witching Hour’  “This is like the witching hour,” he told reporters. “Everything has come to pass right here: obviously the debate over Obamacare, the sequester, the end of the fiscal year, the debt ceiling have all basically converged into a single opportunity for either disaster or negotiated success.”  Republicans are debating what policy conditions they would want to attach to a bill that would end the shutdown, said a Republican aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss party strategy.  House Republicans are backing away from demanding major changes to the 2010 health-care law, the aide said.  The shutdown would pare 0.2 percentage points from U.S. economic growth if it lasts through this week and cost as much as 0.5 points if it continues another two weeks, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Pushing back the debt-ceiling deadline will allow the debate to refocus on delaying the mandate for individuals who lack health insurance to purchase it, said Representative  Raul Labrador , an Idaho Republican.  Extraordinary Measures  Under the House plan, the Treasury Department wouldn’t be able to use so-called extraordinary measures to further extend borrowing authority, creating a hard deadline, said Representative  Tom Reed , a New York Republican. A vote is possible tomorrow or Oct. 12, said Representative  Vern Buchanan  of Florida.  House Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi  of California said ending the extraordinary measures “isn’t very smart” because it would limit Treasury’s flexibility.  Many Republicans want to tie the debt-limit increase to party priorities such as cuts in entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Still to be determined is whether rank-and-file members will agree to the leadership’s proposal.  Republicans have a 232-200 majority and can lose votes from only 15 members before they need to rely on Democrats.  If the U.S. fails to raise the debt limit by Oct. 17, the government will have $30 billion plus incoming revenue to pay its bills. It would start missing scheduled payments, including benefits, salaries and interest, between Oct. 22 and Oct. 31, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Senate Republicans  Senate Republicans will go to the White House at 11:15 a.m. tomorrow.  Meanwhile, Senate Democrats will press ahead with their preferred plan, which would push the next debt-limit fight into 2015 and include no policy conditions. A test vote could occur Oct. 12.  Democrats, who control 54 seats in the 100-member Senate, would need the support of at least six Republicans on procedural votes to pass their bill.  Reid’s bill would suspend the debt ceiling through Dec. 31, 2014. Because the Treasury Department can use what are called extraordinary measures to stave off default, another increase wouldn’t be needed until sometime in 2015. The previous debt-limit suspension expired on May 18 and the extraordinary measures are lasting five months.  Government Shutdown  The government shutdown started Oct. 1 after Republicans insisted that further funding for many programs must be tied to a one-year delay in the health-insurance mandate.  Obama and Senate Democrats refused, and the resulting furloughs and agency shutdowns have slowed mortgage closings, small-business loans and nutrition assistance to poor mothers. Some programs, such as Social Security, continue uninterrupted.  The House has taken a series of bipartisan votes to fund narrow pieces of the government, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  Obama and Senate Democrats reject the piecemeal approach, saying Republicans shouldn’t pick and choose politically popular items.
