Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  said it won
a 108-megawatt order from STEAG GmbH to supply turbines to the
Crucea North project in  Romania .  The order is for 36 V112 3-megawatt wind turbines and
includes a 10-year service agreement, Aarhus, Denmark-based
Vestas said today in an e-mailed  statement . Delivery is planned
to start in April, with commissioning of the farm due to be
completed by the end of 2014, the manufacturer said.  The Crucea North wind farm is being developed by Crucea
Wind Farm SRL, whose main shareholders are STEAG and Monsson
Alma Srl, according to a project  document  posted on the STEAG
website. The deal brings Vestas’s order intake to 3,643
