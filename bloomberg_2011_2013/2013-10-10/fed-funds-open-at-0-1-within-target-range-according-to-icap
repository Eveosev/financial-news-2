Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.10 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.06 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.05 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.08 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire $1 billion to $1.5 billion
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing from January
2018 to February 2043, according to the  Federal Reserve Bank of
New York ’s website. The purchases are part of the Fed’s latest
round of quantitative easing, which is aimed at keeping long
term rates low.  The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  announced on Sept. 20
that it will test an overnight fixed-rate reverse repo facility
as an additional tool to aid policy makers when they eventually
seek to raise  interest rates  and tighten monetary policy. These
temporary open market operations, which will be open to all
eligible reverse repo counterparties and will use Treasury
collateral, will take place between 11:15 a.m. and 11:45 a.m.
New York time. The Fed said the transactions, which began on
Sept. 23, could extend through Jan. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
