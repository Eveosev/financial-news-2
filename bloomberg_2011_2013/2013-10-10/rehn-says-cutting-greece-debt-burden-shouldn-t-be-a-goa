European Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said giving fiscal relief to
Greece by cutting its debt load shouldn’t be a goal of policy
makers, saying he preferred other means.  “We’ve already had two rounds of private sector
involvement concerning Greece,” Rehn said at a panel discussion
in Washington yesterday. “Personally I do not see that haircuts
are either something we should aim for or would be reasonable --
rather, the arsenal would be related to the extension of loan
maturities and a further reduction of  interest rates .”  Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism
bailout fund, said past interest-rate cuts and maturity
extensions are “economically like a haircut.” Investors expect
Greece to get another aid program, which is “probably needed,”
Regling said at the same panel.  Euro-area finance ministers said  in November  they would
“consider further measures and assistance” for Greece to reach
a debt-to-gross domestic product ratio of 124 percent in 2020
once it achieves an annual primary  budget surplus . The
 International Monetary Fund  sees the debt load peaking at 176
percent of GDP this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
