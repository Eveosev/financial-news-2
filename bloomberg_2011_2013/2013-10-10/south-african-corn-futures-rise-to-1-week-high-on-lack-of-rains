South African yellow-corn futures
rose to the highest level in more than a week on concern that
insufficient rains in the biggest production areas of the grain
will curb output, a trader said.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, climbed 0.4 percent to 2,182 rand ($219) a metric ton,
the strongest closing level since Sept. 30 on the South African
Futures Exchange. The white variety for delivery in the same
month gained 0.1 percent to 2,370 rand a ton, the highest since
Oct. 3.  The South African Weather Service’s website shows no rain
has been predicted this week for Welkom in the Free State
province, the region that produces about 41 percent of the
nation’s corn. The North West province, where about 16 percent
of the grain is grown, was declared drought-stricken last month.  “It’s not raining as much as we need, especially in North
West and the Free State province,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst
at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone.  Meal made from white corn is one of  South Africa ’s staple
foods and the yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for delivery in December added 0.3 percent to 3,449
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
