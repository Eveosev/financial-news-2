North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has
replaced his chief of general staff for the third time since  he
took over the country less than two years ago, a report from the
official state news agency indicated.  The Korean Central News Agency referred to Ri Yong Gil
today as Chief of General Staff of the Korean People’s Army,
indicating Kim Kyok Sik no longer holds the post.  KCNA didn’t say when the reshuffle took place or what
happened to Kim. Ri becomes the fourth chief of general staff to
serve Kim Jong Un since he took over the North’s 1.2 million-strong army in December 2011 when his father  Kim Jong Il  died of
a heart attack.  KCNA referred to Ri holding the post in a report on Kim
marking the 68th anniversary of the Workers’ Party of Korea by
visiting the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where the two previous
rulers of  North Korea , his father and grandfather,  Kim Il Sung ,
are interred.  To contact the reporter on this story:
