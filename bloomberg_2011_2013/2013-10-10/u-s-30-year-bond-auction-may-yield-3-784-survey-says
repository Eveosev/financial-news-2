The Treasury’s $13 billion sale of
30-year bonds may draw a yield of 3.784 percent, according to
the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in August 2043, yielded 3.785
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. The yield at the last offering of long bonds, on Sept. 12,
was 3.82 percent, the highest yielding sale since July 2011.  The September sale’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.4, versus an average of 2.47 at the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 37.8 percent of the bonds at the
September sale. The average at the past 10 offerings was 37.84
percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 20.6 percent of
the securities at last month’s sale. The average for the past 10
auctions is 15.4 percent.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 12.5 percent this year,
compared with a 2.6 percent drop in the broader U.S. Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Long
bonds returned 2.5 percent in 2012, versus a 2.2 percent gain by
Treasuries overall.  Today’s offering is the third of three note and bond
auctions this week totaling $64 billion. The government sold $30
billion in three-year debt on Oct. 8 and $21 billion in 10-year
securities yesterday.  The sales will raise $31.7 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $32.3 billion, according to
the  U.S. Treasury .  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
