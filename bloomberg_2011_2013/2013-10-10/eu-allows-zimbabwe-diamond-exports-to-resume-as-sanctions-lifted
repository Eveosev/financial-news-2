The European Union’s representative
in  Zimbabwe  said the southern African nation can resume exports
of diamonds mined in Marange to the 28-member bloc after
sanctions were lifted last month.  “They can start immediately,” Aldo Dell’Ariccia, the head
of the European Union delegation, said in an interview yesterday
on the sidelines of a Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries
meeting in the second city of Bulawayo. A Belgian delegation of
diamond buyers, cutters and polishers is expected to arrive in
the country before the end of this month, he said.  The EU on Sept. 24 ended sanctions against the state-owned
Zimbabwe Mining Development Corp., which operates five mining
companies on a 50:50 joint venture basis in the eastern district
of Marange. Advocacy groups including Ontario-based Partnership
Africa  Canada , have accused Zimbabwe’s ruling party of looting
about $2 billion from the Marange fields, partly to fund the
nation’s military.  Lifting sanctions is expected to boost Zimbabwe’s tax
revenue by $400 million a year, according to the EU.  The bloc wants to ensure that some polishing and cutting of
the gems is done in Zimbabwe so that “more value-added remains
in the country,” Dell’Ariccia said. “Now we don’t have
restrictive measures anymore against ZMDC, European investors
and specialists can see what can be done.”  Zimbabwe is expected to mine 16.9 million carats this year,
according to Mines Ministry estimates. Last year, the country
produced 8 million carats, generating $685 million of revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
