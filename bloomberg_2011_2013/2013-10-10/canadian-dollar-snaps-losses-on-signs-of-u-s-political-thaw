Canada ’s dollar snapped four days of
losses against its U.S. peer as lawmakers in the world’s largest
economy moved toward a debt-limit agreement even as they
remained at odds about the partial government shutdown.  The currency rose along with New Zealand’s dollar and South
Africa’s rand, so-called commodity currencies. Standard & Poor’s
500 Index stock futures rose 1.8 percent, suggesting an increase
in appetite for risk. Statistics Canada may report that the
nation’s unemployment was unchanged at 7.1 percent last month,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  “Today feels like a bit of a catch up to your standard,
across-market responses to the optimism that kicked off
yesterday with some sense that we could reach a resolution to
all the shenanigans in  Washington ,” said  David Tulk , chief
Canada macro strategist with TD Securities in Toronto. “To the
see that at the expense of the U.S. dollar, the expense of the
Japanese yen, looking at strength across the board led by
commodity currencies and everything else seems to be
appropriate.”  The loonie, nicknamed for the image of the aquatic bird on
the C$1 coin, rose 0.1 percent to C$1.0391 per U.S. dollar at
7:54 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys 96.24 U.S. cents.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bond yields were
little changed at 2.59 percent. The 1.5 percent securities
maturing in June 2023 fell two cents to C$90.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
