Alberto Contador ’s Tour de  France 
team will receive more funding from online trader and money
manager Saxo Bank A/S, guaranteeing its future for next year
after another sponsor quit.  The Danish bank agreed to increase backing after Oleg Tinkov’s Tinkoff Credit Systems Bank said it was withdrawing its
sponsorship, team manager  Bjarne Riis  told a news conference in
Madrid. Financial terms weren’t disclosed. Tinkov plans to start
his own cycling team.  The Saxo Bank team had income of 9.06 million euros ($12.3
million) in 2012, which was mostly spent on rider salaries,
according to the latest financial filing by Riis Cycling A/S.
Saxo Bank co-chief executive Lars Seier Christensen declined to
discuss its contribution.  Contador, 30, won the Tour de France in 2007 and 2009 with
the Discovery Channel and Astana teams. He was stripped of his
2010 title with Astana after testing positive for the banned
drug clenbuterol. The Spaniard joined the Saxo Bank team for the
2011 season.  He agreed to take a pay cut of as much as 15 percent on his
$4.5 million salary this year to stay with the team, according
to  Danish newspaper BT .  Contador, who was fourth at this year’s Tour, told the news
conference he was staying loyal to the team after teammates rode
“out of their skin” to support him.  Christensen told reporters the bank’s extra backing was a
“good deal,” boosting its exposure and allowing it to continue
with corporate hospitality. He said Saxo Bank took out 100 hedge
fund managers wearing team jerseys on a 30-mile ride with
Contador outside Zurich yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
