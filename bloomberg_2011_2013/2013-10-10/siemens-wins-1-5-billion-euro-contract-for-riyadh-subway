Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, won a 1.5 billion-euro ($2 billion)
contract to provide two driverless subway-train lines in the
Saudi Arabian capital,  Riyadh .  The order from Saudi Arabia’s High Commission for  Urban
Development  includes electrification systems and signaling
technology, the Munich-based company said today in a statement.  The German company was shortlisted more than 14 months ago
as part of a partnership to develop the Riyadh subway network.
Siemens said today that the total project value is 7.5 billion
euros, shared with San Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc. and
local construction companies Almabani General Contractors Co.
and Consolidated Contractors Co. Riyadh, with a population of 5
million, currently relies on diesel buses for public transport,
Siemens said.  “With six lines and a total route length of 175
kilometers, Riyadh is planning the world’s largest subway
project,” Siemens said.  The manufacturer withdrew from bidding to supply 1 billion
pounds ($1.5 billion) of trains to  London ’s Crossrail commuter-network project in July. Siemens said it was pulling out of the
contest because a high level of existing commitments meant a bid
“would not be a responsible course of action.”  The Riyadh trains will be fitted with cooling systems to
protect passengers from extreme heat, Siemens said. Wheels,
traction drives, brakes and doors will be fitted with special
sales and filters to protect the trains from desert sand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
