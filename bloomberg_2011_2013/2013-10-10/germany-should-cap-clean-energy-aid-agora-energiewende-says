German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
third-term government should cap aid to clean-energy developers
to cut the costs of the country’s plan to shutter nuclear
reactors and expand renewables, a policy adviser said.  Germany  should “radically simplify” its clean-energy
subsidy system by paying no more than 8.9 euro cents (12 cents)
a kilowatt-hour in aid to new renewable units,  Agora
Energiewende , a group owned by the Stiftung Mercator public-policy group and the European Climate Foundation, said today in
a  statement . Aid should decrease in line with capacity
additions, it said.  The plan would favor onshore wind and solar plants over
offshore wind, biomass and geothermal units to “avoid
unnecessary costs for power consumers,” Agora said. New
generators sized 1 megawatt or larger should be forced to sell
power on the market, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
