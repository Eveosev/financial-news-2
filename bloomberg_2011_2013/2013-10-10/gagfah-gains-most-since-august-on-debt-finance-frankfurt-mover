Gagfah SA (GFJ)  rose the most in almost
two months in  Frankfurt  trading after the company said it will
repay most of its debts due in 2014 after obtaining more than 1
billion euros ($1.35 billion) of financing.  Gagfah was up 4.1 percent to 10 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Frankfurt, the fourth-biggest gain in the
50-member MDAX Index for medium-sized companies.  Gagfah, which faced more than 1.5 billion euros of debt
repayments in 2014, said in a statement yesterday that it had
issued a 700 million-euro commercial mortgage-backed security,
extended an existing 200 million-euro credit and obtained a 145
million-euro loan. The measures help reduce the debt due next
year to 445 million euros.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  raised its profit forecast for Gagfah
because of the refinancing in a report published today and
predicted the company would raise its guidance “shortly.”
Analysts Markus Scheufler and Martin Allen increased their
estimate for funds from operations, a measure of a property
company’s ability to raise cash, to 86 cents in 2014 from 81
cents.  Deutsche Bank, which owns about 1 percent of Gagfah shares
according to  data compiled by Bloomberg , has a buy rating on the
German landlord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
