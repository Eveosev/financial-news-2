Burkina Faso  will get a $51 million
grant from the  African Development Bank  to finance projects to
manage water drainage and solid waste in the outlying districts
of the capital, Ouagadougou.  The works will reduce recurrent floods in the areas, where
about 890,000 people reside, or 45 percent of the cityâ€™s
population, the Tunis-based AFDB said in a statement e-mailed by
the African Press Organization today. The cost of the four-year
plan is estimated at $56.7 million, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
