Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  retreated
the most this month after the country’s second-largest lender
said businessman Shlomo Eliahu sold shares at a discount.  The stock fell 1.4 percent, the largest intraday retreat
since Sept. 30, to 13.07 shekels at 1:45 p.m. in Tel Aviv. About
nine million securities changed hands, more than double the
three-month average volume, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Bank Leumi was the second-biggest decliner in percentage terms
on the benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25) , which advanced 0.2 percent.  Eliahu sold about 47 million shares at a price of 12.87
shekels, the bank said in a statement today. That’s 3 percent
below yesterday’s closing price, and values the stake at around
606 million shekels ($170 million). Eliahu was asked by the Bank
of Israel last October to sell his entire holding in the lender
within three years after he agreed to acquire a majority stake
in Migdal Insurance & Financial Holding Ltd.  “The shares are down because the stake was sold at a
discount,” Micha Goldberg, an analyst at  Excellence Investments
Ltd. (EXCE)  said by phone. “This is far from over as Eliahu will be
looking to sell another 3.16 percent stake in the coming 18
months.”  Leumi shares have advanced about 3 percent this year,
compared with a gain of 8.7 percent for the Tel Aviv Banking
Index. The lender posted a quarter-on-quarter decline in profit
in the three months through June 30 as corporate loan growth
waned. Eliahu sold stakes in Leumi in March this year and
October 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
