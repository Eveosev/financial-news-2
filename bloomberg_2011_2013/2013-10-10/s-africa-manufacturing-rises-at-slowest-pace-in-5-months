(Corrects month for decline in vehicle exports in fourth
paragraph.)  South African  manufacturing  rose at
the slowest pace in five months in August as strikes curbed
production in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  Growth in factory output slowed to 0.2 percent from a
revised 5.5 percent in July, Pretoria-based Statistics  South
Africa  said on its website. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
 survey  of 11 economists was 1.2 percent. Output decreased 3.6
percent in the  month .  “Going forward manufacturing production will be
characterized by patchy growth,” Kamilla Kaplan, an economist
at Investec Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in an e-mailed note to
clients before the data was released. “Cost pressures
experienced by producers will remain significant and business
confidence is suppressed.”  Strikes in the mining, manufacturing and construction
industries have strained the economy since August as output and
exports fell. Vehicle shipments slumped 75 percent in September
from a year earlier and the  purchasing managers’ index  dropped
below 50 for the first time in six months, indicating a
contraction in manufacturing.  The South African Reserve Bank has kept its benchmark
 interest rate  at 5 percent for more than a year as  inflation 
pressures prevent it from cutting borrowing costs to stimulate
the economy, which is set to expand 2 percent this year, the
slowest pace since a 2009 recession. Manufacturing makes up
about 15 percent of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
