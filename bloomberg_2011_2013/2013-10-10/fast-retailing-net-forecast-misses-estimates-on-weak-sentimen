Fast Retailing Co. (9983)  fell in Tokyo
trading after Asia’s largest clothing retailer forecast profit
that missed analyst estimates and said discounts hurt domestic
earnings.  The maker of Uniqlo casual apparel dropped 3.2 percent to
33,450 yen at the close of trading in Tokyo. Net income will
probably be 92 billion yen ($935 million) for the year ending
August 2014, the Yamaguchi, Japan-based company said yesterday
in a statement. That’s lower than the 99.3 billion yen average
of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Fast Retailing President Tadashi Yanai, 64, said his
marketing emphasis is shifting away from low prices after per-customer spending in Japan fell for 10 months straight. Yanai is
also adding higher-priced items to the product mix after working
to boost the brand image by opening an outlet in  Tokyo ’s Ginza
luxury shopping district and sponsoring athletes including
tennis players Kei Nishikori and Novak Djokovic.  “The focus for the time being is on maintaining gross
profit margins,” said Takashi Aoki, a Tokyo-based fund manager
at Mizuho Asset Management Co.  Operating margin plunged about 15 percent to 11.6 percent
last fiscal year, the lowest since at least 2002, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales jumped 23 percent in the year,
surpassing 1 trillion yen for the first time as low-priced
thermal underwear, stretch jeans and down jackets lured buyers.  Profit Margin  “We will control margins and boost profit at the domestic
Uniqlo business,” Yanai, Japan’s richest person, told reporters
in Tokyo yesterday. “We will change our marketing to focus on
quality materials and high-function garments, rather than on
price.”  The company forecast operating income of 114.5 billion yen
for its  Japan  Uniqlo chain this fiscal year, 18 percent more
than a year earlier.  The company’s targets for Japan this fiscal year are
“highly challenging,” Taketo Yamate, an analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG in Tokyo wrote in a note to clients. He said a
“very negative” share price reaction should be expected. He
maintained his underperform rating.  Operating profit at the company’s Uniqlo chain in Japan
slumped 5.4 percent to 96.8 billion yen in the year ended in
August, while sales rose 10 percent to 683 billion yen.  Overseas profit soared 67 percent to 18.3 billion yen on
sales of 251.1 billion yen, the company said.  Overseas Expansion  Net income climbed 26 percent to 90.4 billion yen for the
year ended August as sales jumped to 1.143 trillion yen,
according to the statement. The Japanese currency has slumped
about 20 percent against the dollar in the past 12 months.  Fast Retailing has said it plans to open 200 to 300 outlets
overseas annually and will found its first store in Australia
and  Germany  in spring 2014. The retailer targets opening between
20 and 30 stores a year in the U.S. and hopes to reach 100
stores there in the next few years, Yanai said. The company had
previously said it would open about 20 outlets a year in the
world’s biggest economy. The company is also adding stores in
China and  Indonesia  as it bets on global expansion to more than
quadruple sales to 5 trillion yen by 2020.  Yanai yesterday said he plans to stay on in the role of
president beyond his 65th birthday as the company is in the
middle of international expansion. He has a net worth of $17.5
billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and had
earlier said that he would step down at 65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
