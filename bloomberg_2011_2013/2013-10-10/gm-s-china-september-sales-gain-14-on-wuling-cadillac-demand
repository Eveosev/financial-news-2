General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest
foreign automaker in  China , reported sales growth accelerated in
the country last month, fueled by demand for its Wuling and
Cadillac vehicles.  Total sales in September climbed 14 percent to 277,647
units, after expanding 11 percent the preceding month, the
Detroit-based company said in a statement today. Deliveries of
Wuling vehicles, which account for about half of GM’s China
sales, gained 18 percent to 129,648 units last month.  GM’s sales in China have risen 11 percent this year to 2.31
million vehicles, keeping it on track to sell 3 million vehicles
this year in the world’s largest auto market. The automaker is
spending $11 billion by 2016 on new plants and products in China
and will boost production capacity to five million vehicles
annually by 2015.  Buick deliveries rose 14 percent to 71,002 units last
month, helped by demand for the Excelle line, while Chevrolet
sales gained 2 percent to 57,285 vehicles.  Demand for the upscale Cadillac marque surged 74 percent to
a record 4,496 vehicles on deliveries of the XTS sedan and SRX
crossover. The low-cost Baojun brand sold 9.6 percent more
vehicles at 10,028 units, the company said.  GM plans to introduce 17 new models this year in China, its
largest market, focusing on  sport utility vehicles  and luxury
models. The automaker is looking at adding nine new or refreshed
SUVs in China over the next five years.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
