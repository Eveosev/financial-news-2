Brazil  is open to a transaction
between the local units of  Telefonica SA (TEF)  and  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) 
and may require asset sales within a year to approve any deal,
said a government official with direct knowledge of the matter.  Regulators, concerned that a deal would hurt service
quality, would seek to prevent the phone companies from
accumulating a concentration of regional airwave licenses, said
the official, who asked not to be identified because the
scenario is hypothetical. Neither company has sought
authorization for a transaction, the official said.  Telefonica, Telecom Italia’s largest shareholder, struck an
agreement last month to gradually increase its stake, providing a
path to take control of the Milan-based phone carrier. That
would give Madrid-based Telefonica power over both companies’
Brazilian units, who together have more than half of the
country’s mobile-phone lines.  Telecom Italia has valued its 67 percent stake in  Tim
Participacoes SA (TIMP3) , its Brazilian unit, at a minimum of 9 billion
euros ($12 billion) in preparation for any possible sale, a
person with direct knowledge of the matter said this week.
Telefonica may seek to acquire Tim and then sell parts of the
company to its other Brazilian competitors, America Movil SAB
and Oi SA, analysts at HSBC Holdings Plc have said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
