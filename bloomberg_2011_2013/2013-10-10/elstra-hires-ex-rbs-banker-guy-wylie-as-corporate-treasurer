Guy Wylie, the former head of
primary markets for Asia Pacific at  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS) , has joined Telstra Corp. as corporate treasurer, according
to Scott Whiffin, a Melbourne-based spokesman for Australia’s
biggest phone company.  Wylie left the bank due to personal reasons, according to
an e-mailed response he sent to  Bloomberg News  in August.  His appointment follows Telstra’s hire of Cynthia Whelan as
head of strategic finance, Whiffin said. Whelan was previously
chief executive officer of Barclays Australia and  New Zealand .  Telstra said last month it will cut about 1,100 jobs, or
some 3 percent of its workforce, within the next nine months to
boost productivity. The cuts to Telstra’s operations unit would
stop duplication of work and help the division focus on growth,
Brendon Riley, Telstra’s chief operations officer, said in a
Sept. 25 e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
