Palm oil  stockpiles and output in
 Malaysia , the world’s second-largest producer, increased less
than analysts’ expectations last month, potentially boosting
prices of the most-consumed cooking oil.  Inventories rose 7 percent to 1.78 million metric tons from
August, the highest level since May and the biggest jump since
September last year, according to data from the Malaysian Palm
Oil Board. Output gained 10 percent to 1.91 million tons, the
highest since October last year. That compares with the median
estimate of 1.89 million tons for reserves and 2 million tons
for output in a Bloomberg survey published last week. Exports
rose to 1.61 million tons, above the estimated 1.55 million tons.  Futures declined to an almost four-year low in July on
prospects of expanding global supplies. Prices have rallied
since then on sustained demand from overseas buyers and as
worsening conditions threatened the U.S. soybean crop, crushed
to make a substitute oil. Palm, used in everything from candy to
biofuel, is produced year-round with supply accelerating in the
second half because of growing cycles.  “The stockpiles have come below expectations and that
should strengthen prices,” said  Ben Santoso , an analyst with
DBS Vickers Securities Pte., by phone from  Singapore .  Palm oil for December delivery was little changed at 2,366
ringgit ($738) a ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives. Futures
have rallied 11 percent since reaching 2,137 in July, the lowest
level since October 2009. Soybeans rebounded 11 percent since
reaching a 19-month low in August.  Palm oil shipments from Malaysia advanced 17 percent to
542,274 tons in the first 10 days of October from the same
period last month, Intertek said today.  Record Supplies  Prices are still heading for a third annual loss, the worst
run since at least 1996. Global palm oil supply will advance 5
percent to a record 58.1 million tons in 2013-2014, boosting
stockpiles by 17 percent to an all-time high of 9.2 million tons,
the USDA estimates.  “We are still concerned about increasing production in
October,” said Santoso, who expects palm to average 2,300
ringgit in the fourth quarter. “The market is still waiting to
see a seasonal peak and yields to recover.”  World production of soybeans will jump 5.3 percent to 281.7
million tons in 2013-2014 as U.S. recovers from a drought last
year and Brazil heads for the biggest crop ever, making it the
largest producer, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture .  To contact the reporter on this story:
