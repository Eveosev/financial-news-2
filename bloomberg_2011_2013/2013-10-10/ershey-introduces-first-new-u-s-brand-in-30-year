Hershey Co. (HSY)  plans to bring the
Lancaster line of caramel soft cremes that it introduced in
 China  to its home market next year, marking its first new U.S.
confectionery brand in 30 years.  The cremes will go on sale in January and come in three
flavors, the Hershey, Pennsylvania-based company said today in a
statement. The candies, introduced in China in May, are named
after Lancaster Caramel Co., which company founder Milton Hershey opened in 1886 and sold to American Caramel Co. 14 years
later.  That Hershey started selling a product abroad before
bringing it to the U.S. shows how much North America’s largest
chocolate producer has focused on expanding internationally
after passing up the chance to buy British candy maker Cadbury
Ltd. in January 2010. The milk candy market in China is worth
about $1.2 billion, Chief Executive Officer John Bilbrey said
during the company’s second-quarter earnings call.  Cadbury was eventually acquired by Kraft Foods Inc. for
about $19 billion.  Hershey rose 2.3 percent to $93.76 at the close in  New
York . The shares have gained 30 percent this year, compared with
an 19 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
