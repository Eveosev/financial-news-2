Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s Swiss
International airline division will beat its goal for cost
savings and revenue increases in 2015, the unit’s chief
executive officer said.  Earnings improvements will exceed 180 million Swiss francs
($198 million) in 2015 as reorganization measures offset
headwinds from rising fuel costs, Harry Hohmeister, the head of
the brand, said at a business event in Geneva. That compares
with a 160 million-franc target set by the CEO for Swiss in
January, a goal already raised 40 percent from a figure laid out
last year in Lufthansa’s so-called Score profit-revival project.  “The Score program is running very, very well in
 Switzerland ,” he said, adding that earnings improvements this
year will total 74 million francs. Swiss’s employees “are much
more innovative than we as managers thought.”  Hohmeister has run Swiss since 2009 and was promoted to
Lufthansa’s management board on July 1. He’s pushing for more
savings to fight rising kerosene costs and margin pressure on
flights serving  Asia . Prices on Asian routes in September fell
because of “persistent weakness” in the region, Cologne,
Germany-based Lufthansa said today.  Lufthansa Chief Executive Officer Christoph Franz said
yesterday that he’s prepared to revisit the Score program should
some of the initiatives prove insufficient to turn around the
airline,  Europe ’s second-biggest.  Swiss plans on a third consecutive annual record in
passenger figures in 2013 after transporting 15.8 million
travelers last year, Hohmeister said.  Nine-month passenger numbers rose 1.1 percent to 12.2
million as seat occupancy increased 0.9 percentage point to 84.4
percent, Swiss said separately. Lufthansa  reported  a 0.6 percent
gain in group passenger numbers to 79.8 million, with the seat
load factor rising 1 percentage point to 80.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
