Group of 20 finance ministers and
central bankers may request more clarity on U.S. fiscal policy,
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said.  If the communique after the G-20 meeting discusses the U.S.
debt ceiling, “then it will be in the format of a request, that
we’re hoping for the fastest resolution of the crisis that has
emerged around the budget and the debt limit,” Siluanov said in
 Washington  today. “That it be resolved as soon as possible and
that there’s clarity sooner on the fiscal and debt policy of the
world’s largest economy.”  Financial markets, including in emerging economies, jumped
today on optimism that U.S. lawmakers will reach an agreement to
increase the country’s debt ceiling and avoid a default. U.S.
Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew warned Congress that
“uncertainty” over the debt limit is starting to stress
financial markets, speaking a week before the government runs
out of its borrowing authority on Oct. 17.  The debt ceiling will be discussed during a dinner for
finance chiefs today, Siluanov said.  “It will be discussed because it can affect the entire
situation in the world economy,” he said. “Everyone is very
closely following these developments, and I don’t doubt that
this will be among the matters discussed at the meeting of
finance ministers and central bank governors.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
