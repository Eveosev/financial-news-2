Mars Blend strengthened to the
highest level relative to West Texas Intermediate in almost five
weeks after the brief detention of  Libya ’s prime minister
sparked concern that renewed instability may further curb that
country’s exports.  Mars, a medium-density, high-sulfur crude from the  Gulf of
Mexico , strengthened by 25 cents to a discount of $1.25 a barrel
to the domestic benchmark at 12:10 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the narrowest since Sept. 6.  Mars and other Gulf crudes compete with foreign oils priced
against European benchmark Brent for space in U.S. refineries.
Brent’s premium over WTI rose as high as $8.91 a barrel today,
the highest intraday level since June 7.  The spread widened after Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zaidan
was released hours after being seized by a militia at a Tripoli
hotel. Protests have disrupted Libya’s oil production and
exports. Output fell to 300,000 barrels a day in September, the
least since the same month in 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Crude from the Southern Green Canyon strengthened by 40
cents to a discount of $3 a barrel. Poseidon crude rose 40 cents
to $1.90 below WTI.  Light Louisiana Sweet weakened by 60 cents to a premium of
$3. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI rose 10 cents a
barrel to $3.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
