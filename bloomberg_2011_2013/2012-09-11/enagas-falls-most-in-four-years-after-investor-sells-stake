Enagas SA (ENG) , the operator of  Spain ’s
natural-gas transportation network, slumped the most in almost
four years in Madrid trading after an investor sold a 5 percent
stake at a discount.  Enagas slid as much as 7.7 percent, the most since October
2008, and traded down 7.2 percent at 14.60 euros as of 11:43
a.m. local time. The shares were earlier suspended from trading.  Sagane Inversiones, formed by savings banks Caja Murcia,
Caja Castilla La Mancha and Caja Granada, sold its stake at
14.70 euros a share for 175.5 million euros ($224.6 million),
according to a filing today.  Enagas shares had climbed 10 percent this year before
today’s sell-off, in contrast to a 10 percent drop for Spain’s
benchmark IBEX 35 Index. Enagas is still up 2 percent since
December. Banco Santander SA and  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  handled the share
sale for Sagane.  “It was difficult to understand why Enagas had
outperformed the IBEX in the previous days, so it was clear it
should drop at some point,” Francisco Salvador, a Madrid-based
strategist at FGA/MG Valores, said by phone. “Other investors
including the Spanish government could also sell their stakes,
which could mean a drag for the stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
