The pound rose to the strongest
level in almost four months versus the dollar after a report
showed the U.K.  trade deficit  shrank in July as exports soared,
adding to signs the economy is emerging from recession.  Sterling advanced for the fourth time in five days before a
labor market report tomorrow forecast to show the  unemployment 
rate stayed at the lowest in over a year. The pound also gained
as a  Bank of England  policy maker said the U.K. economy may be
stronger than growth data indicate. Ten-year gilts were little
changed after a sale of inflation-linked bonds.  “The trade numbers are surprisingly encouraging which has
important implications for economic growth,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce in  London . “The pound may now have some more
room to rally against the dollar.”  Sterling gained 0.5 percent to $1.6067 as of 4:19 p.m.
London time, after rising to $1.6079, the strongest since May
15. The pound depreciated 0.2 percent to 79.97 pence per euro,
after touching 80.11 pence yesterday, the weakest level since
July 5.  The U.K. shortfall narrowed to 7.2 billion pounds from 10.1
billion pounds in June. The median forecast of 20 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey was 9 billion pounds. Exports rose 9.3
percent, the biggest increase since January 2003, while imports
fell 2.1 percent.  ‘More Momentum’  Britain is struggling to emerge from a double-dip recession
as the debt crisis continues in the euro area, its biggest
trading partner. The Bank of England held its target for bond
purchases at 375 billion pounds last week as policy makers
assessed the impact of their Funding for Lending program to
boost the flow of credit in the economy.  “Some of the other data do suggest there’s a little bit
more momentum in the economy” than the gross domestic product
data suggest,  Ian McCafferty , a member of the Bank of England’s
Monetary Policy Committee, told lawmakers in London today.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne , speaking in the
House of Commons today, said the Autumn Statement, in which the
government updates its growth and fiscal forecasts, will be
published on Dec. 5.  Technical Analysis  The pound faces so-called resistance at $1.6081, the 78.6
percent Fibonacci retracement of the decline from April 30 to
June 1, Axel Rudolph, a senior technical analyst at Commerzbank
AG in London, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Resistance refers to an area on a price graph where
analysts anticipate orders to sell a security. Fibonacci
analysis is based on the theory that prices rise or fall by
certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  The pound has gained 0.6 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 2 percent and
the euro rose 3 percent.  The Debt Management Office sold 1.25 billion pounds of
inflation-linked bonds due in 2034 at a so-called real yield of
0.126 percent. The U.K. last sold the securities on May 3 at a
real yield of 0.05 percent. The Debt Office will auction 3.5
billion pounds of benchmark 10-year securities on Sept 13.  The yield on 10-year gilts rose less than one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.74 percent. The 1.75 percent bond
maturing in September 2022 fell 0.045, or 45 pence per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 100.115.  Gilts have returned 3 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, outperforming German
bunds, which gained 2.6 percent, and U.S. Treasuries, which
earned 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
