Zimbabwe will have to import about
70,000 metric tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to meet demand
this season, the  Chronicle  reported, citing Mishek Kachere, a
spokesman for Zimbabwe Fertilizer Corp. and Windmill (Pvt) Ltd.  Fertilizer makers have about 25,000 tons of the crop
nutrient stockpiled, insufficient to meet demand of about
150,000 tons, the Bulawayo-based Chronicle said on its website.
The producers can’t manufacture enough locally because they’re
still owed funds from the last season, according to the report.  Zimbabwe expects normal to below-normal rains this farming
season, which runs from November to May for crops such as corn,
soy, barley and oil seeds. Demand for compound fertilizers,
usually a mixture of ammonium nitrate and other chemicals, can
be met locally, the state-controlled newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
