Philippine bonds rose before a
government debt auction on speculation the central bank will
reduce borrowing costs further to protect the Southeast Asian
nation’s economy from a global slowdown.  Benchmark  10-year yields  fell this month to the lowest
since at least 2000 as demand surged at a debt sale, allowing
the treasury to borrow for a decade at the cheapest cost since
the Asian financial crisis. While  inflation  quickened in August,
price gains have averaged 3.1 percent this year, staying within
the central bank’s target of 3 percent to 5 percent. Sixteen of
20 economists in a Bloomberg survey expect Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas to keep its overnight rate at a record-low 3.75
percent on Sept. 13. Four predict a cut.  “Inflation is still benign,” said Nina Virata, a fixed-
income trader at Bank of Commerce in Manila. “Another rate cut
before the end of the year is still possible, though unlikely
this week.”  The yield on the 4.875 percent bonds due August 2022 fell
for a second day, dropping eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 4.725 percent in  Manila , according to
Tradition Financial Services. That’s the lowest level since at
least December 2000, data from Philippine Dealing & Exchange
Corp. show.  The government sold 9 billion pesos ($217 million) of 2022
notes today at an average yield of 4.694 percent versus 4.83
percent at a July 31 offering. Demand exceeded the amount on
offer by 4.91 times, the strongest gauge of appetite since
February 2010.  The current monetary policy stance is appropriate, Diwa
Guinigundo, deputy governor of the central bank, said Sept. 8.  The peso gained for a fourth day. The currency rose 0.1
percent to 41.570 per dollar, data from Tullett Prebon Plc show.
It reached 41.548 yesterday, a level not seen since April 2008.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was little changed at 5.70 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
