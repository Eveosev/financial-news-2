Europa League winner  Atletico
Madrid  is among 23 teams that failed to meet payment obligations
worth about 30 million euros ($38.4 million), soccer’s European
governing body UEFA said.  Atletico, which beat  Champions League  winner Chelsea 4-1 in
last month’s Super Cup, could have prize money withheld and be
banned from European competition if it continues to breach club
licensing regulations, UEFA officials told reporters today in
Geneva.  Clubs in the Champions League and Europa League had to
provide the  governing body  details of their finances by June 30.
A financial disciplinary body headed by former Belgian Prime
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene found 23 teams had overdue payments to
other clubs, employees or tax authorities, UEFA said on its
website.  “They’ve known the rules for years now,” UEFA General
Secretary Gianni Infantino said in an interview in Geneva today.
He said the total overdue amounted to about 30 million euros,
half the amount owed last year.  Malaga , owned by a member of Qatar’s ruling family, was
also named in UEFA’s list. It qualified for the Champions League
for the first time this season. Among other teams named by UEFA
were  Turkey ’s Fenerbahce and Sporting Lisbon of  Portugal .  Editor: Christopher Elser, Alex Duff  To contact the reporter on this story:
