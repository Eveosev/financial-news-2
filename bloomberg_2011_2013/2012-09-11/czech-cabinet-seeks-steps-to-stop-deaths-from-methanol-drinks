The Czech government will take
steps to stop a spate of deaths caused by drinks laced with
methanol, Prime Minister Petr Necas said.  Necas asked the health, interior and agriculture ministries
to inform the Cabinet about measures being taken “to prevent
the risk of more tragic incidents,” the government said in an
e-mailed statement from  Prague  today.  A seventh person died today after consuming beverages that
contained methanol following the first case of poisoning
discovered Sept. 3, according to newspaper  Mlada Fronta Dnes .  To contact the reporter on this story:
