Greece ’s state budget deficit in
the first eight months of 2012 beat the budget target and in
August the country recorded a surplus for the first time this
year.  The gap, which excludes outlays by state-controlled
enterprises, was 12.4 billion euros ($15.9 billion) compared
with 18.7 billion euros in the same period a year earlier and a
target of 15.2 billion euros, according to preliminary figures
from the Athens-based  Finance Ministry  today. In August, there
was a surplus of 850 million euros, the ministry said.  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s coalition government
is working to reach agreement with European Union and
International Monetary Fund officials on 11.5 billion euros of
budget cuts for 2013 and 2014, a requirement for the release of
further funds from the country’s two bailouts.  Delays in executing economic revamping tied to the 240
billion euros of bailout loans have caused a funding squeeze for
Greece.  Net budget revenue in the eight-month period was 33.1
billion euros, compared with 32.6 billion euros a year earlier
and short of a target of 35.2 billion euros, according to the
ministry. Net spending was 45.4 billion euros, compared with
51.2 billion euros in the same period of 2011.  The primary deficit in the eighth-month period was 1.3
billion euros, compared with a target of 4.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
