Kazakhstan lowered its 2012
economic-growth forecast as data showed industry in the Central
Asian nation contracted the most since March 2009 last month.  Gross domestic product may advance 5.8 percent this year,
the Economic Development and Trade Ministry said in materials
distributed today in the capital, Astana, trimming a February
forecast for 6 percent growth.  Output at factories, mines and utilities fell 3.7 percent
from a year earlier in August after a 0.5 percent decline in
July, the state statistics agency today said on its website.
Thatâ€™s more than the 1 percent drop predicted by the median
estimate of seven economists in a Bloomberg survey. Oil
production plunged 14.6 percent and natural-gas output fell 4.7
percent, the data showed.  GDP rose 5.6 percent from a year earlier in the first half
of 2012, the State Statistics Agency said Aug. 14. President
 Nursultan Nazarbayev  had predicted May 23 that the economy would
expand 7 percent this year. Policy makers cut the benchmark
refinancing rate by a half-point to a record-low 5.5 percent
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
