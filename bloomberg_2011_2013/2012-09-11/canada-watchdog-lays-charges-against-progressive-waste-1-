Canada’s Competition Bureau said it
has laid charges against  Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd. (BIN)  for
violating a consent agreement with the watchdog.  The bureau said Progressive Waste had agreed to divest
certain assets, including customer contracts, to win approval
for a 2010 merger.  “Breach of a Consent Agreement is a serious offense,” the
Ottawa-based bureau said in a statement.  Chaya Cooperberg, a spokeswoman for Vaughan, Ontario-based
Progressive Waste, said in a telephone interview the company has
complied with the agreement and believes the allegations are
“entirely without merit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
