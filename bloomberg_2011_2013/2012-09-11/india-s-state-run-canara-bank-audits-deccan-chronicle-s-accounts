Canara Bank (CBK) , an Indian state-owned
lender, is conducting a forensic audit of accounts of  Deccan
Chronicle Holdings Ltd. (DECH) , which faces a liquidity crisis, a
ministry official said.  Indian banks have lent Deccan Chronicle, India’s third-
largest newspaper publisher, 50 billion rupees ($905 million),
with loans from state-run banks standing at 38 billion rupees,
D.K. Mittal, secretary of financial services at India’s finance
ministry, said today in New Delhi. Phone calls to Canara Bank
Chairman and Managing Director S. Raman weren’t answered.  Deccan Chronicle has decided to restructure its debt in
accordance with guidelines approved by the Reserve Bank of
India, the company said in a stock exchange filing today.  The company owns the Deccan Chargers, a cricket team
representing the southern city of Hyderabad, in the Indian
Premier League.  Deccan Chronicle shares fell 7.9 percent to 12.25 rupees at
the close in Mumbai, extending its decline this year to 66
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
