Brandon Moss and Cliff Pennington
hit home runs to lift the  Oakland Athletics  to a 3-1 victory
over the Los Angeles Angels, who lost ground in the American
League wild card race as their six-game winning streak ended.  Jarrod Parker allowed one run over seven innings as the
Athletics won their fourth straight game to improve to 80-60,
the AL’s second-best record behind the  Texas Rangers . The A’s
trail the Rangers (83-57) by three games in the AL West.  Oakland sits atop the AL wild card standings, while the
Angels (77-64) fell 1 1/2 games behind the Baltimore Orioles
(78-62). The top two non-division winners in each league earn
wild-card spots in the postseason.  The  Chicago White Sox  used a four-run sixth inning to
defeat Detroit 6-1 and push their AL Central Division lead over
the Tigers to three games.  The  New York Yankees , who lead the Orioles by one game in
the AL East, open a three-game series in Boston today, while the
Orioles host the Tampa Bay Rays. The Rays (77-63) are in third
place in the AL East, two games behind the 79-61 Yankees. The
Washington Nationals pushed their Major League Baseball-best
record to 87-54 with a 5-1 win over the  New York  Mets. Kurt Suzuki,  Ryan Zimmerman  and Ian Desmond hit homers for the
Nationals.  The NL Central-leading Cincinnati Reds are second in the
league with an 85-57 record after beating the Pittsburgh Pirates
4-3 in 14 innings.  The Braves top the NL wild card standings with an 81-61
record following a 4-1 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. The St.
Louis Cardinals are second at 75-66 after an 11-3 loss to the
San Diego Padres.  To contact the reporter on this story:
