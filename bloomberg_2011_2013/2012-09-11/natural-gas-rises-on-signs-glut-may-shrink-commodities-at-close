October delivery jumped 6.4 percent to $2.992 per million Btu

months climbed 0.3 percent to $8,090 a metric ton ($3.67 a
pound). Zinc, tin, lead and nickel also rose.  PRECIOUS METALS  Platinum futures rose, capping the longest rally in a year,
as labor tensions escalated in  South Africa , the world’s biggest
producer of the metal used in jewelry and pollution-control

to $3.1857 a gallon.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee rose, capping the biggest three-session rally in 27
