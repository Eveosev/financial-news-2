Australia , the world’s second-
biggest wheat exporter, cut its harvest forecast as dry weather
in the country’s west curbs production, deepening global supply
concerns as droughts bake fields from the U.S. to  Russia .  Output may reach 22.5 million metric tons in 2012-2013, 6.6
percent below an estimate in June, the  Australian Bureau  of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, or Abares,
said today. The crop was a record 29.5 million tons in 2011-2012.
The agency raised its export estimate to 21.5 million tons in
the year from Oct. 1, from 20.5 million tons forecast in June
and a revised record 24.5 million tons a year earlier, it said.  Wheat has climbed 36 percent this year as the worst U.S.
drought since 1956 and dry weather in Russia shrinks supplies.
World food prices were little changed last month after the
biggest jump since 2009 in July as grain and oilseed prices rose,
the Food & Agriculture Organization said Sept. 6. World reserves
before next year’s Northern Hemisphere harvest may drop 10
percent to the lowest since 2009, U.S. government data show  “Importers around the world are looking to Australia to
provide a significant quantity of wheat over the next 12 months
and that’s a direct consequence of drought in Russia and the
U.S.,” said  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia . “Although Abares is projecting
quite a significant year-on-year decline in wheat production,
total supplies are sufficient to allow a very strong export
program.”  Four-Year High  Wheat for December delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent to
$8.8525 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$8.8625 at 11:11 a.m. in  Singapore . Futures reached $9.4725 on
July 23, the most expensive in four years.  The area planted to wheat in Australia may total 13.3
million hectares (33 million acres), from 13.4 million hectares
estimated in June, the bureau said in today’s report.  Wheat output in  Western Australia , typically the biggest
producer, may drop to 7.1 million tons from 8.7 million tons
estimated in June and 39 percent below last year’s crop,
according to Abares. Production in New South  Wales  may total 7.1
million tons, up from 6.9 million tons forecast in June, it said.  Western Australia’s southwest had the driest July on record
and the state’s mean minimum  temperature  was the coldest since
at least 1950, when comparable records began, according to the
Bureau of Meteorology. An improved rainfall  outlook  from
September to November is not expected to significantly improve
yields given the late stage of crop development, Abares said.  Canola Outlook  The country’s canola production is forecast at 2.76 million
tons, down from 2.94 million tons forecast in June, Canberra-
based Abares said. The bureau cut its forecast for barley output
to 6.96 million tons from 7.3 million tons estimated in June.  Total winter-crop output -- including wheat, barley and
canola -- may be 36.2 million tons in 2012-2013, compared with
45.3 million tons a year earlier, it said.  Cotton production in Australia, set to be the second-
biggest exporter, may total 991,000 tons compared with 1.05
million tons forecast in June as farmers plant a smaller dryland
crop amid lower prices, the bureau said. The harvest was a
revised record of 1.07 million tons a year earlier.  Cotton has tumbled 18 percent this year, the second-biggest
decline among the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, after record prices spurred output. The
area sown to dryland cotton in Australia may decline 30 percent
in 2012-2013 on concern the growing season may be dry and as
lower prices cut margins, Rabobank Group said in a report today.  The U.S. is set to be the world’s biggest exporter of both
cotton and wheat in 2012-2013, followed by Australia, according
to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . The agency will update
production and export estimates tomorrow.  To contact the reporter for this story:
