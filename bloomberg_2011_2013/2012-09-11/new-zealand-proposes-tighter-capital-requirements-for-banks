New Zealand  will introduce tougher
capital adequacy requirements for banks starting Jan. 1 as the
nation moves to adopt so-called Basel III rules, the  Reserve
Bank  said.  The proposed changes include increased capital requirements
for banks that will strengthen the ability of lenders to absorb
losses, the Wellington-based central bank said in an e-mailed
statement.  “Banks’ overall capital levels are strong and generally
already exceed the new requirements,” deputy governor Grant Spencer said in the statement. “While some technical features
of bank capital instruments will be fairly new to  capital
markets , they are likely to become a feature of bank capital
internationally.”  The Basel III changes are aimed at strengthening the
international banking system, and New Zealand’s plans are mostly
in line with those of  Australia ’s bank regulator, Spencer said.
New Zealand’s four largest lenders, which handle about 90
percent of all deposits, are all wholly owned units of
Australian banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
