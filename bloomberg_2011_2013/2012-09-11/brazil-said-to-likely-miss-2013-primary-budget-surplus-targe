Brazil is likely to miss its fiscal
target next year because of tax cuts and other stimulus measures
introduced to boost growth, two government officials said.  The government’s initial estimates shows it is likely to
take advantage of accounting rules allowing it to subtract
certain investments from its primary  budget surplus  target next
year, said the officials, who are familiar with the forecast
though not authorized to discuss it publicly.  The government is seeking a budget surplus before interest
payments next year of 155.9 billion reais ($77 billion), or
about 3.1 percent of gross domestic product. Under Brazilian
budget rules, the government can discount up to 25 billion reais
next year to fund growth-boosting investments in infrastructure.  “There is no damage to the net debt-to-GDP ratio, but it
increases the chances of the central bank reversing the monetary
easing. We expect an increase in Selic in the
middle of 2013,” said  Jankiel Santos , chief economist at Banco
Espirito Santo Investment bank, in a phone interview from  Sao
Paulo .  President  Dilma Rousseff  plans to announce 15.2 billion
reais in tax cuts as part of a plan to boost economic growth to
4.5 percent next, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told reporters
Aug. 30.  Keeping Options Open  Rousseff reduced today taxes on energy bills that will cost
the government 3.3 billion reais a year, according to Treasury
Secretary Arno Augustin.  The government did not reach its full fiscal targets in
2009 and 2010, according to data from the  Finance Ministry . In
2009, it used a 400 million-real discount while in 2010, the
discount was 8.3 billion reais due the fiscal performance in
Brazil’s states and cities.  At the Aug. 30 presentation of the 2013 budget proposal,
Mantega said there’s a possibility the government might discount
25 billion reais even as the budget guidelines law allows a 40
billion-real discount.  “We may discount or not,” Mantega said.  Brazil’s central bank, which lowered the benchmark  interest
rate  to a record 7.5 percent last month, said its inflation
outlook is based on a forecast that the government will fully
meet the primary surplus goal, according to the minutes of its
Aug. 28-29 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
