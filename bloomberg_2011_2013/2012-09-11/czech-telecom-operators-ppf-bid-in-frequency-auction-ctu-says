Telefonica Czech Republic AS (SPTT) , T-
Mobile Czech Republic AS, Vodafone Czech Republic AS, PPF Mobile
Services AS filed bids in an auction for telecommunication
frequencies in the country, the Czech Telecommunications Office
said.  The regulator will assess whether the bids comply with all
the requirements by Oct. 10, the Prague-based office, or CTU,
said in an e-mailed statement today.  CTU expects to complete the auction for allocations of
frequencies by the end of the year and a final decision should
be made at the beginning of 2013 after the regulator receives
money for the frequencies, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
