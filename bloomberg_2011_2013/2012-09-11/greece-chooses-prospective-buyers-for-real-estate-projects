Greece ’s state asset-sales fund
chose a  Lamda Development SA (LAMDA)  unit to lease the  International
Broadcasting Center  in  Athens  for 90 years after an 81 million-
euro ($105 million) bid in a public tender.  “The full utilization of the IBC will not only
commercially upgrade the specific area but will also revive
investors’ interest in the capital’s real estate market,”
Hellenic Development Fund Chief Executive Officer Ioannis Emiris
said in an e-mailed statement.  The deal will be the first real estate privatization in the
country’s plan to raise 25 billion euros from public property to
reduce debt. The broadcast center was built for the 2004  Olympic
Games  and includes the Golden Hall shopping mall with a total
area of 132,200 square meters (1.4 million square feet) and an
additional vacant area of 21,600 square meters.  Depending on the state of the economy over the next 50
years, the Greek government could receive as much as an
additional 32.4 million euros from the deal with Lamda Domi, a
unit of Lamda Development, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
