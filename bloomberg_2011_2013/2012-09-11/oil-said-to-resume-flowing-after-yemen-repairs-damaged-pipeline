Oil resumed flowing through Yemen’s
main crude pipeline in the central province of Marib yesterday
after crews repaired damage caused by tribesmen, according to an
oil ministry official and an oil company engineer.  Technical teams finished repairing the 420-kilometer (261-
mile) pipeline whose sabotage on Sept. 9 had halted the flow of
oil from Marib to an export terminal at Ras Eisa on the  Red Sea ,
according to the  Interior Ministry , the state’s Saba news agency
said yesterday in a text message.  Pumping resumed at 7 p.m. local time yesterday, according
to an engineer for Safer Exploration & Production Operations Co.
The engineer and the oil ministry official who also said oil was
flowing requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to
speak to reporters.  Crude from Marib has been cut off from refineries and
markets as a result of at least 18 attacks on the pipeline since
March 2011. Until the attack this week and one last week, oil
had been flowing since an earlier round of repairs on July 15.  Yemen ranks ninth in the  Middle East  for output of both oil
and natural gas, according to data from  BP Plc. (BP/)  It produced
264,000 barrels a day of crude in 2010, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
