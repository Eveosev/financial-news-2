China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670) , the
country’s second-largest carrier by passenger numbers, rose the
most in about three months in Hong Kong after announcing plans
to raise $570 million selling shares to its state-owned parent.  The company gained 4.7 percent, the most since July 13, to
close at HK$2.43. Its Shanghai-listed stock rose 5.2 percent,
the most in about eight months.  The airline will use the funds from selling new Shanghai
and Hong Kong stock to repay borrowings, helping pare debt
levels that are the highest among the nation’s big three
carriers.  Air China Ltd. (753)  and China Southern Airlines Co. have
also received new funding from their parents as the government
helps the industry contend with slower traffic growth and an end
to large gains from currency appreciation.  “The injection will help the carrier’s mid-to-long term
development,” said Li Lei, a Beijing-based analyst at China
Securities Co. “It also showed government support for the
strategic industry.”  China Eastern’s share sale will comprise 698.9 million
Shanghai-listed shares priced at 3.28  yuan  apiece and 698.9
million Hong Kong-listed shares costing HK$2.32 each, the
Shanghai-based airline said in a stock-exchange  filing  yesterday.
That’s about in line with the previous closing prices on Sept. 5.
The shares were subsequently suspended until today.  The airline will raise 2.29 billion yuan ($361 million)
from the Shanghai stock sale and HK$1.62 billion ($209 million)
in the Hong Kong offering, it said. The funds will be used to
repay bank and financial institutions as well as for boosting
working capital.  The airline’s long-term debt is 1.9 times total equity,
higher than Air China’s 1.2 times and China Southern’s 1.1 times,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lower Profit  China Eastern ’s first-half  profit  tumbled 65 percent, the
smallest drop among the nation’s big three airlines, to 806.9
million yuan because of higher fuel costs and currency losses.  Air China announced a 1.05 billion yuan share sale to its
state-owned parent in April after its parent received government
subsidy. China Southern said in June it was planning a sale of
as much as 2 billion yuan. China Eastern didn’t say if its
parent received subsidy from the government.  China Eastern plans 12.6 billion yuan of  capital spending 
in the second half, mainly for plane purchases. It will receive
21 new aircraft including Airbus SAS A320s, twin-aisle A330s and
 Boeing Co. (BA)  737s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
