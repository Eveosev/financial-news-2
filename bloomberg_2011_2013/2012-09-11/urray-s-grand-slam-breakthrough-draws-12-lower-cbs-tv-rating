Andy Murray ’s five-set U.S. Open
victory over Novak Djokovic drew a 12 percent lower major-market
television rating for CBS than Djokovic’s victory a year
earlier, according to the network.  Yesterday’s men’s final at the National Tennis Center in
New York, which was pushed to a Monday finish for the fifth
consecutive year because of weather, was seen in an average of
2.3 percent of homes in the top 56 U.S. television markets,
Jerry Caraccioli, a spokesman for the  CBS Corp. (CBS)  network, said in
a telephone interview, citing  Nielsen Holdings NV. (NLSN)  That’s 12
percent lower than the 2.6 rating Djokovic’s four-set victory
over Rafael Nadal in 2011 drew.  Murray, the 25-year-old No. 3 seed, earned his first Grand
Slam title, ending a 76-year drought since  Fred Perry  was the
last British man to win a major tournament, with the 7-6 (12-
10), 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2 victory that began at 4 p.m. New York
time.  The rating peaked at 4.2 from 9 to 9:15 p.m. for the
conclusion of the match, which at 4 hours, 54 minutes tied the
U.S. Open record as the longest men’s final.  Serena Williams’s fourth U.S. Open title two days ago, a
three-set win over Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, drew a 3.4
major-market rating, 3 percent higher than a year earlier when
Williams lost to Samantha Stosur in the final.  The last time the men’s final was played in its regularly
scheduled Sunday time slot was 2007, when  Roger Federer  topped
Djokovic. That match drew a 3.7 major-market rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
