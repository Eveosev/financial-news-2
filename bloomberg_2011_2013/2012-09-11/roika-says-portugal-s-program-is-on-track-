A team from the  International
Monetary Fund , the European Commission and the  European Central
Bank  said the program of measures attached to  Portugal ’s bailout
is “broadly on track,” even though the country’s economy is
expected to shrink again next year.  “Overall, this review confirms that the program is making
progress, albeit against strong headwinds,” the so-called
troika said in a joint statement released today after a two-week
visit in Lisbon. “Provided the authorities persevere with
strict program implementation, euro area member states have
declared they stand ready to support Portugal until full  market
access  is regained.”  Portugal’s debt will peak below 124 percent of gross
domestic product, “remains sustainable, and will be on a firm
downward trajectory after 2014,” the troika said.  The approval of these conclusions will allow the
disbursement of 4.3 billion euros ($5.5 billion) under the
bailout, which is co-financed by the European Union and the IMF,
according to the statement. That could take place “in
October,” pending approval of the IMF board and of European
officials, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
