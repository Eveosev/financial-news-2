Russia , the world’s third-biggest
wheat exporter last season, bought at least 100,000 metric tons
of the grain in July and August,  SovEcon  said.  Wheat purchases this year will be “important” in
balancing local supply and demand, the Moscow-based researcher
said on its website today. That contrasts with prior periods,
when “good crops” meant imports were “insignificant” for the
domestic grain balance, according to SovEcon.  Russia imported 89,000 tons of wheat in the 2010-11 season,
when the country’s worst drought in at least 50 years seared
fields, and 100,000 tons in the following period, U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates show. Inbound shipments in
the current 2012-13 season through June may come to 200,000
tons, according to the USDA, after more dry weather hurt crops.  Wheat exports  from Russia may drop to 8 million tons in
2012-13 from 21.6 million tons in the previous period because of
the drought, USDA estimates show. That would rank the country
fifth among shippers of the grain after the U.S.,  Australia ,
 Canada  and the European Union.  Wheat for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to $8.9075 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 4:13 p.m. Moscow time.
Prices are up 36 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
