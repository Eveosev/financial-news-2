Polypore International Inc. (PPO) , a
producer of membranes used in rechargeable batteries, forecast
lower-than-expected third-quarter profit amid a “weakness” in
sales and the shutdown of a customer’s plant that makes plug-in
electric vehicles.  Earnings per share excluding one-time items will be in the
low- to mid-30-cent range, Polypore said today in a statement.
The average of 11 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was
49 cents. While September sales are improving, the company
experienced “weakness” in July and August, it said.  Polypore, which is holding an investor day tomorrow, didn’t
identify the operator of the vehicle plant.  General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest U.S. automaker, plans to
stop production for about four weeks in September and October at
the factory that makes Chevrolet Volt cars, two people familiar
with the plan said Aug. 28.  Polypore rose 2.6 percent to $36.91 at the close in  New
York  after earlier  dropping  as much as 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
