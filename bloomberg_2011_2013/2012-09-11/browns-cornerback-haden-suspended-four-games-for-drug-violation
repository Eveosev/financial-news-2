Cleveland Browns cornerback Joe Haden has been suspended four games for a violation of the
 National Football League ’s policy on performance-enhancing
substances.  Haden won’t receive pay during the suspension, which begins
immediately, the NFL announced in an e-mailed release. It will
cost the 23-year-old roughly $1.4 million and he will not be
eligible for the Pro Bowl, according to the Cleveland Plain
Dealer.  Haden tested positive during the offseason for the
stimulant Adderall, and played in the team’s first game of the
season as he was appealing the suspension, the Associated Press
reported.  Browns spokesman Neal Gulkis said the team wouldn’t comment
beyond the NFL’s statement.  Haden, who won a national championship with the University
of Florida after the 2008 season, was selected No. 7 overall by
the Browns in the 2010 NFL Draft. He had no interceptions last
season after leading the team with six takeaways during his
rookie year.  Haden will miss Cleveland’s games against the Cincinnati
Bengals, Buffalo Bills,  Baltimore Ravens  and  New York Giants . He
will be eligible to return for Cleveland’s Oct. 14 home game
against the division-rival Bengals.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
