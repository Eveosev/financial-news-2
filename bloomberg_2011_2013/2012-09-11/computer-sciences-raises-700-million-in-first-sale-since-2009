Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) , the
manager of networks for  NASA  and the U.S. Navy, sold $700
million of bonds in its first offering in more than three years.  The company issued $350 million each of three- and 10-year
securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 2.5
percent, three-year debt priced to yield 220 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries and the 4.45 percent, 10-year
bonds paid a spread of 280 basis points. The sale was originally
set at $500 million. Proceeds will be used to repay debt.  CSC previously issued debentures in February 2009, selling
$1.7 billion of debt in two parts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  Falls Church , Virginia-based companyâ€™s $1 billion
of 6.5 percent securities maturing in March 2018 traded on Sept.
7 at 113.4 cents on the dollar to yield 3.79 percent, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  The company is also getting a $250 million  term loan  led by
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. and Bank of America Corp. The
lead arrangers have received commitments from a syndicate of
lenders for the planned credit, which will mature in four years,
according to a regulatory filing today.  CSC expects that as much as $250 million will be borrowed
from the delayed-draw loan within five months of closing. It
said in the filing that it may use the proceeds for general
corporate purposes, including the refinancing of  debt .  To contact the reporters on this story:
