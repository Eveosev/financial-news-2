Measures to reduce water usage in
an area of eastern  Japan  that includes Tokyo went went into
effect today, as light rainfall in August caused reservoir
levels to fall.  The program to cut water usage by 10 percent became
necessary after water levels in reservoirs that supply the Kanto
region dropped to 39 percent of capacity, Japan’s ministry of
land, infrastructure, transport and tourism said on its website.  Water supply in the region was previously limited for five
days in August 2001, Susumu Sawada, who heads the water
management section at the ministry’s Kanto Regional Development
Bureau, said by telephone today. Sawada declined to say when the
restriction will be lifted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
