 Singapore  time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
gained 0.1 percent to 1,630.0752.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the highest level in almost three weeks in
 New York  as investors waited to see if the U.S. will add
stimulus to its economy, countering concern that  Europe ’s
bailout plan will falter and derail the recovery.  Crude for October delivery was at $96.44 a barrel, down 10
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:37 p.m. Singapore time. It earlier slid as much as 46
cents. The contract rose 12 cents to $96.54 yesterday, the
highest close since Aug. 22. Prices are 2.4 percent lower this

speculation that government data will show a smaller-than-normal
increase in stockpiles after Hurricane Isaac shut production.  OIL PRODUCTS  High-sulfur  fuel oil  fell 4 cents to $3.25 a barrel below

for the second time in three days. Gasoil swaps for October
decreased 10 cents to $130.50 a barrel, PVM data showed.  BASE METALS  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rose, after dropping for the first day in three
yesterday, as the outlook for more stimulus from the U.S.
Federal Reserve spurred demand for the metal as a store of
value. Palladium headed for the best run since 2008.  Cash gold climbed as much as 0.4 percent to $1,732.60 an
ounce before trading at $1,730.97 by 3:13 p.m. in Singapore. The

ounce, after climbing to $673 yesterday, the highest price since

$17.12 a bushel, erasing a 0.6 percent gain. Corn for December
delivery slid 0.2 percent at $7.8175 a bushel.  Palm oil  declined to the lowest level in more than three
weeks on concern that declining exports from  Malaysia , the
world’s second-biggest producer, may boost stockpiles amid a
seasonal pick-up in output.  The November-delivery contract dropped as much as 2 percent
to 2,878 ringgit ($928) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest level since Aug. 16, and ended the morning
session at 2,883 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur .  Rubber climbed for a fourth day to the highest level in
more than seven weeks on speculation that the U.S. and  China  may
take additional measures to bolster economic growth, supporting
demand for raw materials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
