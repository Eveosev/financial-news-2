HarperCollins Publishers LLC
reached an agreement with  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and other e-commerce
companies that results in lower prices for electronic books, in
keeping with an antitrust settlement between the U.S. government
and some book publishers.  “HarperCollins has reached agreements with our e-retailers
that are consistent with the final judgment,” Erin Crum, a
spokeswoman for HarperCollins, said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. “Dynamic pricing and experimentation will continue
to be a priority for us as we move forward.”  The agreement follows a judge’s approval last week of an
earlier settlement between the government and  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s
HarperCollins,  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s Simon & Schuster and Lagardère SCA’s
Hachette Book Group. The  Justice Department  had sued the
publishers -- along with companies such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  -- claiming
that the defendants conspired to fix prices on e-books in
violation of U.S. antitrust law.  The settlement lets retailers return to setting their own
prices.  Following the approval of the settlement, Amazon is
lowering prices on “a broad assortment of HarperCollins
titles,” Sarah Gelman, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Amazon,
wrote yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  The New York Times had previously reported the agreement
between Amazon and HarperCollins. News Corp. is based in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
