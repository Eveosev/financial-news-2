Investors in Treasuries remained
bullish this week, betting that the prices of the securities
will rise while cutting neutral positions, according to a survey
by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The  proportion  of net longs was at 8 percentage points in
the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan. The figure is
down from 10 percentage points in the previous week.  The percent of outright longs rose to 23 percent, up from
21 percent the previous week, and the most since July 23, the
survey said. The percent of outright shorts, or bets the
securities will fall in value, rose to 15 percent from 11
percent, reaching the most since June 18, the survey reported.  Investors cut neutral bets to 62 percent from 68 percent,
the survey reported.  The yield on the benchmark U.S.  10-year note  rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.68 percent at 7:56 a.m.
in  New York . The yield rose 12 basis points last week. It
touched a record low of 1.379 percent on July 25 and reached a
2012 high of 2.4 percent on March 20.  JPMorgan doesn’t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York,
wasn’t immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
