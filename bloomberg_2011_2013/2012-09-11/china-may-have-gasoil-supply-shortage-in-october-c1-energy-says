China , the world’s second-biggest
oil consumer, may have a shortage of  gasoil  in October as
seasonal demand rises, according to  C1 Energy .  Gasoil supply will be tight this month, and inventories may
drop to 23 days of use, Liao Na, a Shanghai-based oil analyst
with the energy researcher, said at a forum today in  Singapore .
The gap may reach 840,000 metric tons in October, she said.  Demand for gasoil usually rises in China’s autumn, driven
by farmers and construction workers. The country’s gasoil use
may average 3.4 million barrels a day this year, including net
imports of 10,000 barrels a day, according to Li Li, another
analyst at C1.  Oil-product consumption may gain from 4 percent to 5
percent this year, two percentage points less than last year, Li
said. Gasoline use may rise 8 percent to 1.6 million barrels a
day, she said.  China may see a surplus of oil products after 2015, when
more refineries expand, Li said. The country’s fuel market will
be balanced in general these two years as supply remains limited
on slow output expansion amid easing demand, she said.  China’s total oil-refining capacity may rise to 14 million
barrels a day by the end of this year, including 10.5 million at
major refineries run by the state government and the rest 3.5
million at privately run “teapot” plants, according to Li.  To contact the reporter on this story:
