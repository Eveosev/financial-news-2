American International Group Inc.
had its outlook cut to negative by  Standard & Poor’s  after a
Treasury Department share sale reduced the government’s stake in
the insurer below 50 percent.  “We are no longer giving credit for government support in
the holding-company rating,” S&P said today in a statement on
the New York-based insurer as it lowered the outlook from
stable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
