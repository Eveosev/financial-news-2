Romanian  inflation  quickened for a
third month in August to the fastest in a year as a drought
pushed up food costs and the leu fell to a record low.  The inflation rate rose to 3.9 percent, compared with 3
percent in July, the Bucharest-based  National Statistics
Institute  said today by e-mail. The figure exceeded the 3.7
percent median estimate of eight economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Prices increased 0.5 percent from the previous month.  Inflation in the eastern European country may accelerate
this year more than the central bank’s 3.2 percent forecast due
to political turmoil that plunged the leu to a record low and a
drought that boosted prices for imports and food, Governor Mugur Isarescu said Aug. 6. This year’s rate is likely to stay within
the bank’s target of 2 percent to 4 percent, he said.  Food prices rose 3.3 percent in August from a year earlier,
compared with a 1.2 percent gain in July, the institute said.
Price growth for non-food items accelerated to 3.9 percent,
compared with 3.4 percent in July.  Industrial output expanded a seasonally adjusted 1.9
percent in July from a year earlier, after a 1.4 percent gain in
June, the institute said in a separate release today. Output
rose 1.1 percent on the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
