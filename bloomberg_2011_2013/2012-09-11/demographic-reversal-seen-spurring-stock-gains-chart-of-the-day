Demographics are about to shift in
favor of stocks for the first time since the 1990s, according to
Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the number of Americans who
were 35 to 39 years old at midyear, as compiled by the Commerce
Department, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s performance
since 1980.  This age group is poised to increase for the next 17 years,
according to estimates compiled by the department and presented
in the chart. The outlook reflects the aging of the echo boom
generation, or children born in the 1980s and 1990s to post-
World War II baby boomers.  Americans in this category are entering their “savings
years” at 35 through 39, Levkovich wrote in a Sept. 7 report.
Saving and investing by the echo boomers “would generate a new
set of equity fund inflows,” he wrote.  This year’s total of 19.8 million people is the smallest
since 1989 and 14 percent lower than a record set in 1998. The
peak was reached during the Internet bubble of the 1990s, when
the  S&P 500  and other market benchmarks soared.  Levkovich expects the S&P 500 to rise next year to 1,615,
about 50 points higher than the index’s record in October 2007.
Expansion in U.S. manufacturing, energy, mobile technology and
housing and efforts to curb  federal budget  deficits will combine
with demographics to lift stocks, the New York-based strategist
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
