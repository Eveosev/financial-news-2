Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn 
said he will pursue information about “obvious failures” at
 Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , in his second letter this week
criticizing the maker of trucks and engines.  “I would prefer to amicably resolve this matter with
Navistar and not engage in the tiresome and expensive process of
protracted litigation and a proxy fight,” Icahn wrote in a
letter to the company’s shareholders today.  The investor said he was responding to the Lisle, Illinois-
based company’s statement yesterday that it was disappointed
that Icahn “has chosen to pursue his unproductive tactics of
threats, attacks, and disruption rather than continuing
constructive engagement.” Navistar was reacting to Icahn’s
Sept. 9 letter to its board.  Icahn is pressuring Navistar’s new management, led by
former  Textron Inc. (TXT)  Chief Executive Officer Lewis Campbell,
after the company had a net loss of $241 million for the first
three quarters of its fiscal year and last month ousted Dan
Ustian as its CEO. Icahn in the Sept. 9 letter said he wants
four board seats made available to shareholders “immediately.”  Karen Denning, a Navistar spokeswoman, declined to comment
on Icahn’s letter to shareholders. Icahn has a  14.94 percent 
stake in the company and is its third-largest stockholder,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Navistar rose 2.5 percent to $24.58 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  have tumbled 35 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
