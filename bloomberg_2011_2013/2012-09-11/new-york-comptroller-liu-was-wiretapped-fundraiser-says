John Liu ,  New York City ’s
comptroller, was wiretapped by investigators as part of a probe
into his fundraising in 2009, according to a court filing by a
fundraiser accused of using “straw donors” for Liu.  “Beginning in 2009 the government conducted an
investigation into the fundraising practices of Mr. Liu,”
lawyers for Oliver Pan said yesterday in a filing in federal
court in  Manhattan . “Although the investigation included
surveillance and extensive wiretapping, it failed to produce
evidence of criminal conduct by Mr. Pan or Mr. Liu.”  Pan was charged in February with engaging in a scheme to
use straw donors to obtain matching funds for a candidate who
wasn’t identified in the indictment. Pan’s lawyers said in
yesterday’s filing that he was a minor fundraiser and that he
was entrapped in a sting operation. They asked for the court to
throw out the case because of alleged misconduct by federal
investigators.  Pan’s lawyers said in the filing that he was coerced into
helping the government “manufacture” a crime last year after
the 2009 investigation had failed to discover any wrongdoing.
Pan was arrested after last year’s attempt also failed to
produce evidence against Liu, according to the filing.  Liu’s representatives didn’t immediately return a call to
his press office after regular business hours yesterday seeking
comment on Pan’s filing.  The wiretapping was reported earlier by NY1.  The case is U.S. v. Pan, 12-00153, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
