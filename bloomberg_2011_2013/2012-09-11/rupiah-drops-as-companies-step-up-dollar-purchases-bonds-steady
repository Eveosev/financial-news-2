Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened for the
first time in four days on speculation local companies stepped
up dollar purchases to meet import and debt payments.  Government bonds  were steady before  Bank Indonesia  meets
this week to review its  reference rate . All 22 economists in a
Bloomberg survey predict the benchmark will be left unchanged at
5.75 percent for a seventh month. Indonesia’s imports exceeded
exports for a fourth month in July, when the trade  deficit  was
$177 million, according to official figures.  “We see regular demand for the dollar in the third quarter
as corporates start fulfilling their annual payments,” said
Taufan Tito, a Jakarta-based foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank
Rakyat Indonesia. “The rupiah’s gains would be limited as we
see many orders waiting to buy dollars.”  The rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 9,579 per dollar as of
3:44 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest decline since Sept. 5,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. One-
month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was unchanged at 5.85 percent, the lowest
level since May 2.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent notes due May 2022
was little changed at 5.97 percent, the lowest level since Aug.
