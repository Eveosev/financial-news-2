The cost of insuring corporate
bonds in Australia and  Japan  from non-payment rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 4 basis points to
152 as of 10:33 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia
Bank Ltd. The benchmark rose for the first time in three days
yesterday to 151 basis points, according to data provider CMA. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 2 basis points to
202.5 as of 9:16 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
The index also advanced yesterday after dropping 12 basis points
on Sept. 7, its biggest one-day decline since Oct. 28, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 132.5 basis points
as of 8:34 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge fell for a fifth consecutive day
yesterday, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
