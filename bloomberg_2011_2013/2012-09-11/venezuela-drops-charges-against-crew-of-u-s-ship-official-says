Venezuela  has dropped weapons
charges brought against the crew of a U.S.-owned merchant ship
and released the captain from custody, a U.S. embassy official
said today.  The ship, which was held in the port of Maracaibo, may
depart Venezuela tomorrow or Sept. 12, said the official, who
asked not to be named because of embassy policy. Charges were
brought against the crew on Aug. 31.  The captain and 14 crew members, all U.S. citizens, were
arrested following an inspection in which three assault rifles
were discovered on the cargo ship Ocean Atlas. The arrests
followed the August detention of an unnamed U.S. citizen
attempting to enter Venezuela from Colombia whom President  Hugo Chavez  said may be a “mercenary.”  The Ocean Atlas is a heavy-lift, box-hold, multipurpose
vessel, according to a description of the ship on the website of
New Orleans-based Intermarine LLC.  A spokeswoman for Venezuela’s Information Ministry was not
immediately able to comment when contacted today by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
