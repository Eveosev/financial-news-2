Gasfrac Energy Services Inc. (GFS) , an
oilfield-services company that changed management last year,
fell the most in a month after saying its chief executive
officer and chief operating officer are leaving immediately.  Gasfrac fell 16 percent to C$2.43 at the close in Toronto,
the most since Aug. 9. The stock has declined 65 percent this
year.  The board is seeking replacements for CEO Zeke Zeringue, at
the helm since November, and COO Steve Batchelor amid a company
operational review, Calgary-based Gasfrac said in a statement
today. Chief Financial Officer Jim Hill will take over as the
interim CEO. The company didn’t provide a reason for the
departures.  The executive shuffle introduces more uncertainty for
investors, Megan MacNeill, an analyst at Haywood Securities Inc.
in  Vancouver , said in an interview. “This is the second time
within under a year that management has changed,” said
MacNeill, who rates Gasfrac the equivalent of a hold and has a
C$3.50 price target on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
