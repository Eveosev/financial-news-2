Citigroup Inc. expects the sale of
a stake in  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Smith Barney to result in a $2.9
billion charge in the third quarter.  The expense will be about $4.7 billion before taxes based
on a $13.5 billion valuation of the brokerage unit, the New
York-based lender said today in a regulatory filing. The sale of
a 14 percent stake is expected to boost Citigroup’s Tier 1
common equity ratio under Basel III rules by about 0.14
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
