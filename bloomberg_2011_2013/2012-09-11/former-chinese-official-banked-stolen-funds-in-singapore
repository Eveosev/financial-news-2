Li Huabo, a former local government
official in China who fled the country last year, received
S$182,700 ($148,000) in stolen money in his  Singapore  bank
accounts, a prosecutor said at the start of a trial.  Li was arrested after a confidential informant told police
in February 2011 that he had transferred proceeds of criminal
conduct to Singapore, prosecutor Luke Tan said today in
Singapore Subordinate Court.  Interpol ’s Bejing office also sent
a notice to Singapore, Tan said.  Li, a Chinese national who had made investments and
arrangements to settle in Singapore in early 2010, acquired
Singapore permanent resident status and faces a jail term of as
long as five years and an unspecified fine for each of the three
charges of having received stolen funds. The money was
transferred to his United Overseas Bank account between Dec. 6,
2010 and Jan. 15, 2011, according to court papers.  The case comes amid a crackdown on corruption in  China 
ahead of its once-in-a-decade leadership transition. Former
Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun was last week charged with
crimes including taking bribes and abuse of power. The Communist
Party said last month it will impose a five-year plan to battle
corruption and has banned lavish government banquets and luxury
expenses.  Subhas Anandan, Li’s lawyer, declined to comment ahead of
today’s hearing. Li, free on S$80,000 bail, also declined to
comment.  3,000 Yuan  Li, who earned 3,000  yuan  ($473) a month as section
director at Poyang County Finance Bureau where he oversaw water
projects, made a S$1.5 million investment in Singapore, claiming
he was a general manager of a Chinese energy company when he
applied for permanent residency in the city state, Tan said.  As many as 18,000 officials from the government, judiciary
and state-owned companies fled China with 800 billion yuan ($126
billion) since the 1990s, according to a report by the Chinese
central bank that briefly appeared on its website in June last
year.  Li is also separately accused by Chinese authorities of
embezzling 94 million yuan, according to a  report  by the  China
Daily . Singapore and China don’t have an extradition treaty.  The Chinese embassy in Singapore didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mailed request for comment.  The criminal case is Public Prosecutor v Li Huabo.
