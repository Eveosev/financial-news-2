Bayern Munich  received the most
from a 100 million euro ($128 million) fund created by European
soccer’s governing body to pay clubs for releasing players for
Euro 2012 and the qualifying matches for the 16-team tournament.  Germany’s richest club received 3.1 million euros as the
country’s national team reached the semifinals in the event co-
hosted by Ukraine and Poland. Spanish champion Real Madrid was
the next highest recipient, getting 3 million euros for
releasing its players. Spain beat Italy 4-0 in the final to
become the first country to retain the title.  The size of  UEFA ’s payments to teams will rise to 150
million euros for the next tournament, which will be hosted by
France in 2016. The increase is connected to the event being
enlarged from 16 to 24 teams.  Barcelona, which contributed the most players to Spain’s
roster, got 2.21 million euros ahead of English champion
 Manchester City  with 2.07 million euros and Italy’s title winner
Juventus with 2.02 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
