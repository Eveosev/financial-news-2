Serbia ’s foreign-exchange reserves
fell below 10 billion euros ($12.8 billion) in August for the
first time in 13 months on debt repayments to creditors
including the  International Monetary Fund .  Reserves declined 2.3 percent to 9.9 billion euros after
Serbia repaid 107.2 million euros to the IMF and 24.1 million
euros to other foreign creditors, the Belgrade-based Narodna
Banka Srbije said in an e-mail today. The reserves compared with
12.1 billion euros at the end of 2011.  Net reserves, excluding deposits by commercial lenders and
money from the IMF, inched up to 5.54 billion euros from 5.53
billion euros at the end of July, the central bank said.  Banks withdrew 96 million euros from their mandatory
reserve accounts, while the government repaid 13.5 million euros
to domestic creditors and the central bank sold 15 million euros
to support the dinar in the local market, the bank said. Inflows
included 37.6 million euros in the government’s euro-denominated
borrowing and 18.1 million euros of credits and donations.  Total reserves equaled 419 percent of M1 money supply, down
from 435 percent in July. Interbank foreign-currency trading
rose to 1.6 billion euros from 1.49 billion euros in July,
bringing the eight-month volume to 11.35 billion euros, the bank
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
