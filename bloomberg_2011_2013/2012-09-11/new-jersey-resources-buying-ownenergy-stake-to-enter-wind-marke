New Jersey Resources Corp. (NJR) , the
owner of a natural-gas distribution company that serves almost
500,000 customers in the state, agreed to buy 20 percent of
OwnEnergy Inc., its first investment in wind power.  New Jersey Resources, which has focused its renewable-
energy support on residential and commercial solar systems, paid
$8.8 million for the minority stake, the Wall, New Jersey-based
company said today in a statement.  OwnEnergy, based in Brooklyn,  New York , has completed and
sold three wind farms totaling 141 megawatts of capacity and is
developing 1,300 megawatts of other projects, according to the
statement. The closely held company works with landowners,
farmers and local businesses on projects of 10 megawatts to 80
megawatts that are often owned by community residents.  A New Jersey Resources representative will join OwnEnergy’s
board, which also includes executives from existing investors
EnerTech Capital Partners and  California Public Employees’
Retirement System . The investment gives the power company the
option to purchase “shovel-ready projects” from OwnEnergy.  The company’s New Jersey Natural Gas unit serves more
than 486,000 customers in central and northern parts of the
state, according to its  website . The investment was made by its
NJR Clean Energy Ventures unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
