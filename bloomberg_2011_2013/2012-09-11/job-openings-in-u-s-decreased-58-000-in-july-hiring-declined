Job openings  in the U.S. dropped in
July, indicating employment growth may be hard-pressed to pick
up through year-end.  The number of  positions  waiting to be filled fell by 58,000
to 3.66 million, the Labor Department said today in a statement.
Hiring and separations also cooled.  Companies are reluctant to add workers as  Europe ’s debt
crisis slows global markets and the so-called U.S. fiscal cliff
of automatic tax increases and spending cuts looms at the end of
2012. Persistent unemployment, a “grave concern” according to
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , is a hurdle for
 consumer spending , which makes up about 70 percent of the
economy.  “Firms are going to remain cautious about adding jobs,”
 Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in
Lexington,  Massachusetts , said before the report. “Demand is
lackluster. All the uncertainty is still there.”  Today’s report helps shed light on the dynamics behind the
monthly employment figures.  Payrolls rose by 96,000 workers in August after a revised
141,000 increase in July that was smaller than initially
estimated, the Labor Department said on Sept. 7. The median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a
130,000 advance. Private payrolls, which exclude government
agencies, rose 103,000 after a revised gain of 162,000.  The number of people hired fell to 4.23 million in July
from 4.28 million the previous month, while the hiring rate held
at 3.2 percent, today’s report showed.  By Industry  Job openings decreased in manufacturing, professional and
business services, and education and health services.  Companies reducing staff include  Mountain View , California-
based  Google Inc. (GOOG) , which plans to cut about 4,000 positions at
its Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. unit, with about one-third
of the reductions coming in the U.S. Printer maker  Lexmark
International Inc. (LXK)  will shed 1,700 jobs globally.  Total firings, which exclude retirements and those who left
their job voluntarily, decreased to 1.55 million from 1.76
million a month before, today’s report showed.  About another 2.16 million people quit their jobs in July,
up from 2.13 million in the prior month. The separations rate
fell to 3 percent.  Past Year  In the 12 months ended in July, the economy created a net
1.8 million jobs, representing 51.4 million hires and about 49.6
million separations, today’s report showed.  Considering the 12.8 million Americans who were  unemployed 
in July, today’s figures indicate there are about 3.5 people
vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the recession
began in December 2007.  The payrolls report last week showed the  unemployment rate 
unexpectedly dropped to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent as more
Americans left the  labor force . The rate has been stuck above 8
percent since February 2009, the longest stretch in monthly
records going back to 1948.  The lack of progress in the labor market helps explain why
Federal Reserve policy makers meeting this week may opt for
additional easing to boost the economy. The U.S. has managed to
recover 4.1 million of the 8.8 million jobs lost as a result of
the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
