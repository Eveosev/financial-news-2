Greece ’s Democratic Left party,
which supports the coalition government of Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras, said international inspectors have called for
the statutory  retirement age  to be raised to 67 from 65 and for
state employees to be dismissed.  “These measures must be avoided,” the Athens-based party
said in an e-mailed statement today. It laid out alternatives to
about 3 billion euros of the measures already proposed by the
government in an 11.5 billion-euro budget package for the next
two years.  Democratic Left, which has 17 lawmakers in Parliament, said
it was opposed to six of the measures in the package including
cuts to disability benefits which would save 272 million euros
and across-the-board cuts to pensioner bonuses to save 2.2
billion euros. It proposed these measures be replaced by further
cuts in defense spending, health procurement and an overhaul of
tax breaks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
