France’s farm and food exports, the
world’s fifth-biggest by value, rose for a second month in July
as overseas sales of wine and cognac more than made up for a
drop in grain shipments.  Exports climbed to 4.56 billion euros ($5.8 billion) from
4.33 billion euros a year earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry 
wrote in an online  report  today. Sales of spirits including
cognac jumped 29 percent on higher prices and volumes.  France is the world’s largest wine exporter and the
European Union’s biggest grain shipper. Agricultural trade
resulted in a current-account surplus of 11.6 billion euros last
year, the highest since at least 1995, according to the
ministry.  “The  trade surplus  for transformed products is rising
fast,” the ministry said. “Wine, alcohol and food preparations
are driving the growth.”  Farm products and food contributed to a current-account
surplus of 842 million euros in July, down 22 million euros from
the same time a year ago.  France’s grain exports excluding rice plunged to 490
million euros from 628 million euros in July last year, while
oilseed and protein-crop exports slipped to 118 million euros
from 125 million euros, the ministry said.  “Exports of soft wheat and corn continue to plunge at this
very start of the campaign,” the ministry wrote.  Wine and champagne shipments rose to 654 million euros from
588 million euros. Total beverage exports rose to 1.23 billion
euros from 1.04 billion euros, helped by a jump in cognac sales,
the report showed.  France  imported 3.72 billion euros of agricultural goods
and food in the month, compared with 3.47 billion euros in July
2011, the ministry said.  Food and farm exports climbed to 32.8 billion euros in the
first seven months of 2012 from 32.3 billion euros in the year-
earlier period, while the current-account surplus slipped to
6.01 billion euros from 6.09 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
