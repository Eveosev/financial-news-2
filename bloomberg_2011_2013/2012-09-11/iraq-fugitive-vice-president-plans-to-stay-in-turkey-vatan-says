Iraqâ€™s fugitive Vice President
Tariq al-Hashimi said he will stay in  Turkey  as long as possible
after an Iraqi court sentenced him to death, Vatan reported.  Hashimi, a  Sunni Muslim , said at a press conference in
Ankara yesterday that he has no intention of seeking political
asylum from Turkey and described himself as a guest, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said today.  A Baghdad court convicted Hashimi on Sept. 9 of running
death squads whose alleged victims included a lawyer and a
government security official. Hashimi yesterday accused Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki of fabricating charges against him.  Turkey, a mostly Sunni nation, has granted a residence
permit to Hashimi and his family, who are living in a guarded
apartment in Istanbul. That a move strained ties with  Iraq ,
which has a Shiite Muslim-led government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
