Hungary may complete talks on a
credit line from the  International Monetary Fund  and the
European Union as late as spring 2013,  Nepszabadsag  reported,
citing an unidentified government official.  The government is “not in a hurry” to restart and
complete talks as it faces no liquidity or budget financing
difficulties, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
