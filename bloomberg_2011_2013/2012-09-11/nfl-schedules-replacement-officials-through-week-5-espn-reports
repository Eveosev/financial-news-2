The  National Football League  has
made up a schedule for replacement officials to work games
through the first five weeks of the season,  ESPN reported ,
citing an unidentified league official.  The NFL and the NFL Referees Association have been unable
to agree on a new labor contract, with differences on pay,
pensions and operational issues. The league locked out the
officials in June and NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  said last
week that the two sides are probably $50 million to $70 million
apart on terms of a new five- to seven-year contract.  The NFL started the season with replacement officials from
the lower college football levels working the opening week of
the season. Buffalo Bills Pro Bowl defensive end Mario Williams
was among the players who complained about the Week 1
officiating, saying penalties committed against him weren’t
called in a 48-28 loss to the  New York  Jets.  “Some of the officials on the field don’t understand what
constitutes an offsetting penalty,” Williams said. “Also, pass
blocking doesn’t include hands to the face. When someone tells
the officials that, and they just walk away, or they don’t call
it, that is disheartening.”  In the  Arizona  Cardinals 20-16 win over  Seattle , officials
mistakenly awarding the Seahawks an extra timeout in the closing
seconds. Referee Bruce Hermansen acknowledged the error in a
statement after the game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
