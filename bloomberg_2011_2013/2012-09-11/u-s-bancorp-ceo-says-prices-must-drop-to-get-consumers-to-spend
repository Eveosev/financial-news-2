U.S. Bancorp (USB)  Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Davis , who runs the fifth-largest U.S. lender by
deposits, said consumers won’t lead an economic recovery for the
first time “in our collective lifetimes.”  Psychology has shifted as declines in housing prices cause
people to feel less wealthy, Davis said today at an investor
conference sponsored by Barclays Plc. Because of that, consumers
will be a “slow catalyst” in the recovery, and businesses will
have to cut prices to get people to spend, he said.  “If you think of consumer versus business, who blinks
first? It’s always been the consumer,” said Davis, 54.
“Consumers are going to be likely to wait this one out.”  Davis hasn’t posted a loss in the six years he’s run the
company, using a traditional banking strategy of taking deposits
and making loans that he describes as “boring.” The bank’s
credit rating was upgraded one level in August by Standard &
Poor’s, which said the Minneapolis-based firm has outperformed
competitors since 2008’s financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
