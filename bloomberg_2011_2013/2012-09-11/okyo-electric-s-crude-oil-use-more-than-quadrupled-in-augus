Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s crude
oil consumption more than quadrupled in August as the company
increasingly relies on thermal power generation after the
Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The utility, known as Tepco, used 402,000 kiloliters of
crude last month, the highest since February, up from 95,000
kiloliters a year earlier, according to data released on its
 website . Its’ liquefied natural gas consumption was little
changed.  The country has only two operating reactors, owned by
Kansai Electric Power Co., after meltdowns and radiation leaks
at Tepco’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station in March 2011
prompted shutdowns of atomic plants.  Japan  may be forced to
spend 22.6 trillion yen ($289 billion) on fossil fuels, such as
natural gas, crude oil and coal, causing a trade deficit for the
second straight year in the period ending March 2013, the
Institute of Energy Economics said in a July 2 report.  The following table shows Tepco’s consumption and purchases
of  fuel oil , crude, LNG and coal for August. For fuel oil and
crude, the volume is in kiloliters while LNG and coal are in
metric tons.
