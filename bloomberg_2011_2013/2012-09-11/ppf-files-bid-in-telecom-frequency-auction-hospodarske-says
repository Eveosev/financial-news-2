PPF Group NV filed a bid for new
frequencies to be auctioned by the Czech telecommunications
regulator,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing PPF’s investment
head Robert Sevela.  PPF, which is competing with the country’s three
telecommunications service providers in the auction, plans to
build its own network and offer a full set of voice and data
services if it wins the tender, the newspaper said.  The Czech Telecommunications Office will identify all
bidders in the auction later today, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
