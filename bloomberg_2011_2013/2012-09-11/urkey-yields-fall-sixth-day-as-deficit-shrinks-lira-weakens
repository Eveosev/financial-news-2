Turkey ’s bond  yields  fell for a
sixth day as the lowest  current-account deficit  in 21 months
supported bets of an interest-rate cut. The lira weakened.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt retreated 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 7.23 percent at the close
in Istanbul, the lowest since January 2011 and within 33 basis
points of a record low. The lira depreciated less than 0.1
percent to 1.8030, declining for a second day.  The current-account gap narrowed for the ninth month to
$3.9 billion in July from $5.4 billion a year earlier after
exports grew and imports shrank, the central bank in Ankara said
on its website today. Turkey’s economy expanded by an annual 2.9
percent in the second quarter, the slowest pace since a
recession in 2009, the statistics office said yesterday. The
monetary policy committee will meet on Sept. 18.  “The current-account deficit is clearly showing a slowing
economy and gives a helping hand” to the central bank in
cutting  interest rates , Baris Buyukdemir, general manager of
Ceros Securities in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  The shortfall was expected at $4 billion, according to the
median estimate of 11 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Rates Corridor  Central bank Governor Erdem Basci said on Aug. 29 he would
lower the upper limit of its interest-rate corridor -- 11.5
percent -- to help support economic growth. Basci smothered
spending with higher interest rates as Turkey’s current-account
gap hit a record 10 percent of gross domestic product last year.
He introduced the rates band in October with a 5.75 percent
lower limit to rein in credit growth and control inflation.  The  average borrowing cost  for Turkish lenders fell to 6.20
percent on Sept. 7, the lowest since Nov. 21, 2011, as the bank
lent at its lowest funding rate since June 4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The bank provided 1.5 billion liras ($831 million) at its
lowest 5.75 percent policy rate today, compared with 2 billion
liras a week earlier in one-week repurchase agreements auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
