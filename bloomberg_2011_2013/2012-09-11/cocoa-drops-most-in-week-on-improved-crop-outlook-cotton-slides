Cocoa futures fell the most in a
week on an improved crop outlook in West Africa, the world’s top
growing region. Cotton also dropped.  Rains are forecast in coastal areas of  Ivory Coast  through
Sept. 17, according to the National Meteorological Service. Last
week, cocoa jumped to a 10-month high partly on concern that dry
weather would erode crop prospects in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the
biggest producers.  “Talk of better weather recently” in West Africa is
pressuring prices,  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price
Futures Group in Chicago, said in an e-mail. “Prices went up
quite a bit and are now correcting.”  Cocoa for December delivery declined 1.6 percent to $2,611
a metric ton at 11:04 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York ,
heading for the biggest loss since Sept. 4.  Cotton futures for December delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
75.5 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
