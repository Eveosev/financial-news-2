Mexico ’s industrial production rose
4.9 percent in July from a year earlier, above expectations and
the fastest pace since February, the national statistics
institute, said today on its website.  Economists expected industrial production to rise 3.9
percent, according to the median forecast of 15 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Output grew 3.7 percent in June from a year
earlier after rising by a 13-month high in February of 6.05
percent.  Growth in July was led by the  construction industry  that
expanded 6.8 percent from the year earlier.  Mexico’s economic growth beat economist forecasts in the
second quarter, expanding 0.9 percent from the first three
months, an annualized rate of 3.5 percent, as exports increased
5.8 percent from a year earlier. The economy is being buoyed by
an economic recovery in the U.S., the destination of 80 percent
of the nation’s exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
