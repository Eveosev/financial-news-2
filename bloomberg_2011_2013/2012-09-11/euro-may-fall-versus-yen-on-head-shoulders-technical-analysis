The euro may decline toward a one-
month low against the yen should it fail to break through the
so-called neck-line on a head-and-shoulders chart, according to
Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd.  The head of the chart was the March 21 high with the Feb.
27 and April 20 peaks as shoulders, said Takuya Kawabata, a
researcher at Gaitame.com, a unit of  Japan ’s largest currency-
margin company. The neck-line, running through the interim lows
of March 6 and April 16, is at 100.87 today, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The euro traded at 99.96 yen as of 8:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , up
6.2 percent from the 94.12 level on July 24 that was the lowest
since November 2000.  “The euro is trying to break above the neck-line, but
failure to do so is likely to result in a drop,” said Kawabata
in Tokyo. “If it happens, I expect the euro to slide toward the
June 1 low to form an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.”  The inverse pattern would have the June 1 low as a shoulder
and the July 24 low as a head, he said. A decline to the June 1
level of 95.60 would be the lowest since Aug. 3.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
