The Baltimore Ravens opened their
season with a 44-13 rout of the Cincinnati Bengals as  Joe Flacco 
passed for 299 yards and two touchdowns, and  Ray Rice  rushed for
a pair of scores.  Ed Reed added a 34-yard interception return for a touchdown
last night in Baltimore as the Ravens, who lost in last season’s
American Football Conference championship game, extended their
home winning streak to 11 regular-season games.  The Ravens became the record fifth National Football League
team to score 40 or more points during in their opening game
this season, joining the New York Jets (48), Chicago Bears (41),
 Atlanta Falcons  (40) and Washington Redskins (40).  “It was a lot of fun,” Flacco said at a news conference.
“We didn’t get that many drives, really, but we were efficient
enough that we put points on the board.”  The San Diego Chargers closed out Week 1 of the NFL season
with a 22-14 victory over the Oakland Raiders last night.  Nate Kaeding kicked five field goals for the Chargers and
 Philip Rivers  threw a second-quarter touchdown pass to Malcom Floyd. After the Raiders scored their lone touchdown with 54
seconds left, the Chargers recovered the ensuing onsides kick to
seal the victory.  In Baltimore, the Ravens jumped out to a 17-3 lead and then
scored the game’s final 27 points after the Bengals had pulled
within 17-13 midway through the third quarter.  Baltimore’s defense had four sacks of Bengals quarterback
 Andy Dalton  and Reed entered the NFL’s record book with his 34-
yard interception return for a score in the third quarter. Reed
now has 1,497 career yards on interception returns, surpassing
Rod Woodson’s previous mark of 1,483 yards.  “We got outplayed and outcoached,” Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said at a news conference. “We didn’t play well enough to
win in any phase.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
