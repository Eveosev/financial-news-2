Oil rose for a fifth day on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will announce additional
measures to stimulate the economy, increasing fuel demand.  Prices capped the longest streak of gains since July as the
Fed prepared for a two-day meeting starting tomorrow. Oil also
advanced as the dollar weakened against the euro after Moody’s
Investors Service said it may lower the U.S. credit rating.  “People are anticipating that there will be some stimulus
plans” that should increase oil demand, said  Chris Barber , a
senior analyst at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
 Massachusetts . “The Moody’s announcement points to a weaker
dollar, which tends to raise commodity prices.”  Crude for October delivery gained 63 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $97.17 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since Aug. 22. The five-day increase is the
longest since July 19. Prices are 1.7 percent lower this year.  The futures were little changed after the  American
Petroleum Institute  reported oil inventories increased 221,000
barrels to 359 million last week. The October contract rose 32
cents, or 0.3 percent, to $96.86 a barrel at 4:34 p.m. in
electronic trading. Prices were at $96.93 before the report was
release at 4:30 p.m.  Brent oil for October settlement increased 59 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end at $115.40 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Aug. 31 that he
wouldn’t rule out more economic stimulus. The central bank
bought a total of $2.3 trillion in bonds from December 2008 to
June 2011 in two rounds of asset purchases known as quantitative
easing.  Euro Gains  The dollar slipped as much as 0.9 percent against the euro
after Moody’s said it may lower the U.S. credit rating to Aa1
from Aaa unless budget negotiations during 2013 lead to a
reduction of the percentage of debt to gross domestic product. A
stronger euro and weaker dollar increase oil’s appeal as an
investment alternative.  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the U.S. on Aug. 5, 2011, and
has said political and fiscal risks may lead to another
lowering. Fitch Ratings rates America at AAA with a negative
outlook.  The euro may be affected tomorrow when the Federal
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe decides whether Germany can
participate in the 500 billion-euro ($640 billion) European
Stability Mechanism, which offers loans to  member states  and may
buy their bonds to cut borrowing costs.  ‘People Waiting’  “People are waiting for the Fed meeting and the German
constitutional court decision,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “Oil’s
strengthening is predicated on the idea that more steps will be
taken to stimulate the economy.”  U.S. equities rose before tomorrow’s Fed meeting. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.3 percent.  “People are buying ahead of the Fed meeting,” said Bill
Baruch, senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in  Chicago .
“Crude oil is also following the equities. Everybody is banking
on the dollar becoming weaker.”  The U.S. Energy Department increased its oil price
projection for 2012 today in the monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook . The department projects a price of $95.66 a barrel
versus last month’s estimate of $93.90.  The department’s Energy Information Administration raised
its forecast for global consumption this year to 89.09 million
barrels a day, up 0.9 percent from 2011. Consumption will climb
1.1 percent to 90.1 million barrels in 2013.  Inventory Forecast  Oil also increased as a Bloomberg survey showed U.S.
 inventories  may have dropped last week to the lowest level since
March as more than a third of Gulf of Mexico output remained
shut 10 days after Hurricane Isaac made landfall.  Stockpiles fell 2.9 million barrels to 354.2 million in the
seven days ended Sept. 7, according to the median of 11 analyst
estimates before an Energy Department report tomorrow. That
would leave supplies at the least since March 23.  “A drop in inventories should add bullish support, even
though it should just be temporary,” Barber said.  West Texas Intermediate oil in New York may rise to $107 a
barrel to narrow the gap between the benchmark grade and other
regional crudes,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said in a report
today. An increase is needed to encourage the flow of North
Dakota’s Bakken crude to Cushing,  Oklahoma , said  David Greely , a
New York-based analyst at Goldman.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 457,923
contracts as of 4:35 p.m. Volume totaled 493,096 contracts
yesterday, 7.9 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.57 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
