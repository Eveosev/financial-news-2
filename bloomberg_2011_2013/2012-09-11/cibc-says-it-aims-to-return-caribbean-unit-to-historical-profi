Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-biggest bank, aims to revive profit from
Caribbean banking after being “hit hard” from recessions in
the U.S. and U.K., said executive  Richard Nesbitt , who oversees
the business.  CIBC aims to return its Caribbean banking business, called
FirstCaribbean International Bank, “to historical levels of
profitability,” Nesbitt said today in a bank conference in  New
York  hosted by Barclays Plc. “The recession and the follow-up
to the recession has hurt the Caribbean quite a bit and we think
there’s significant growth in profitability as that business
returns to normal.”  Caribbean banking will improve when tourism from the U.S.
picks up, Nesbitt said.  Nesbitt, a senior executive vice president and group head
for international and wholesale banking, also said CIBC will
continue pursuing smaller  takeovers  to expand in areas including
 wealth management . The bank has no plans to add a U.S. retail
bank, or pursue major acquisitions for its investment-banking
unit, said Nesbitt, who also oversees  CIBC World Markets .  “You should not expect any sort of transformative
acquisition at CIBC,” Nesbitt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
