Bancolombia SA (BCOLO)  offered to buy back
its subordinated dollar bonds due 2017 in exchange for
securities due five years later to extend maturities and reduce
financing costs.  Bancolombia (PFBCOLO)  offered to swap as much as $400 million worth
of the 6.875 percent notes due 2017 for its 5.125 percent
subordinated bonds due 2022, according to a filing today. The
offer ends Oct. 5.  The swap follows the Medellin-based bank sale last week of
a record $1.2 billion of bonds overseas amid a tumble in global
borrowing costs. The average yield on dollar debt for Colombian
companies fell to a record low 4.08 percent yesterday,
JPMorgan’s CEMBI Broad index  shows .  “Not only is Bancolombia extending maturities from five to
10 years but its cutting costs,” said Daniel Velandia, the head
analyst for Bogota-based brokerage Correval SA. “There’s
appetite for corporate issuance from companies in  emerging
markets  with solid fundamentals, such as Bancolombia.”  Bancolombia is  rated  Baa3, the lowest investment grade
ranking, by Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
