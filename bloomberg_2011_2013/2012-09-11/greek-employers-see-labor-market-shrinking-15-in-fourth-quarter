Greek employers predict that the
domestic labor market will contract 15 percent in the fourth
quarter from the third, led by job losses in construction,
manufacturing and tourism,  Manpower Inc.’s  Greek unit said.  Construction employers predict a 21 percent decline in
headcount in the three months through Dec. 31, according to a
Manpower survey of 750 companies received by e-mail today.
Manufacturers expect a 14 percent drop in the workforce, while
restaurant and hotel owners foresee a 29 percent contraction and
retailers and wholesalers a 16 percent decline.  Unemployment rose to 24.4 percent in June, according to the
Hellenic Statistical Service. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s
coalition government is working to reach agreement with European
Union and International Monetary Fund officials on 11.5 billion
euros ($14.7 billion) of budget cuts for 2013 and 2014, part of
requirements to ensure bailout funds keep flowing to the
country, which is in its fifth year of recession.  The Manpower survey found that 9 percent of companies
intend to add workers, down four percentage points from the
previous quarter, and 25 percent expect to reduce payrolls,
three percentage points higher than in the third quarter; 65
percent foresee no change in staffing levels.  A 14 percent decline in employment is expected in Attica,
which includes  Athens  and is the country’s largest region, and a
17 percent drop is seen in northern  Greece , the study showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
