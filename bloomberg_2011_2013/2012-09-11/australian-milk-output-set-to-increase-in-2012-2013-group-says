Milk production in  Australia , the
worldâ€™s fourth-biggest dairy exporter, may gain about 2 percent
to 9.65 billion liters in 2012-2013, Dairy Australia said today,
maintaining a prior forecast.  Australian farmers may receive A$4.70 ($4.87) to A$5 per
kilogram of milk solids in the season, according to a statement.
That compares with a range of A$4.50 to A$4.90 forecast in May.  Trading conditions suggest a so-called modest price
increase by the end of the season as global supply tightens, it
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter for this story:
