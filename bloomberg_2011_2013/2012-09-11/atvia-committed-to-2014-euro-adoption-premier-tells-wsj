Latvia  still plans to adopt the
euro in 2014, even as the currency area’s economy shrinks and
some members seek bailouts, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis
said, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Dombrovskis doesn’t predict “doomsday scenarios” with
regard to the euro’s fate, he said in an interview published
today on the newspaper’s  website . Euro-area membership will
boost confidence and investment in Latvia’s economy, Dombrovskis
said, according to the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
