Northern Irish golfer Rory McIlroy
said he hasn’t yet made a decision about which country to
represent in the 2016 Olympics.  “Playing in the Olympics would be a huge honour,” he said
in an open letter published via his Twitter account. “However,
the games in Rio are still four years away and I certainly won’t
be making any decision with regards to participating any time
soon.”  McIlroy released the statement after the Daily Mail
newspaper reported that the golfer said he felt more British
than Irish. Like all competitors born in the U.K. province, the
golfer can choose between Ireland and Britain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
