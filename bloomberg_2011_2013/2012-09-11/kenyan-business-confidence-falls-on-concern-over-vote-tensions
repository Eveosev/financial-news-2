Optimism among Kenyan companies has
declined in the run-up to elections due in March 2013 amid
concern about the prospect of ethnic tensions, according to a
survey by Ipsos Synovate and  Kenya  Private Sector Alliance.  The Business Leaders Confidence Index, based on a survey of
145 executives, declined to 53.8 in August from 68.6 when the
previous poll was conducted in February 2010, Maggie Ireri,
managing director of  Ipsos Synovate Kenya , told reporters today
in Nairobi, the capital.  Investors usually grow less confident before elections in
 East Africa â€™s biggest economy, a period when tensions between
tribes escalate into power struggles, Patrick Obath, chairman of
 KEPSA , the acronym for the alliance representing more than 200
Kenyan-based companies, said at the same event.  Allegations of vote-rigging at the last presidential
elections in December 2007 sparked ethnic clashes over two
months that left 1,100 people dead and stifled economic growth.  Recent clashes between farmers and pastoralists in
northeastern and southeastern Kenya are adding to negative
perceptions about the country, Obath said. The attacks could be
politically driven as the country redefines constituency
boundaries, according to the  United Nations .  About 100 people have died in the fighting in the Tana
River delta over the past month, including three people in the
most recent attack today, and the area is now under a dusk-to-
dawn curfew imposed by President Mwai Kibaki. Intercommunal
violence killed at least 16 people in the northeastern
communities of Wajir and Mandera in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
