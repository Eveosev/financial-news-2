Thailand ’s baht fell from a four-
month high as concern over Europe’s debt crisis grew before a
court ruling on Germany’s participation in a regional bailout
fund, reducing demand for riskier assets. Bonds were steady.  The  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia Pacific Index of shares fell as Germany’s
Federal Constitutional Court is due to rule tomorrow on the
country’s participation in the European Stability Mechanism,
which gives loans to member states and may buy their bonds.
Global funds bought $27 million more Thai equities than they
sold yesterday, taking net purchases this month to $71 million,
exchange data show. The  Federal Reserve  concludes a two-day
meeting this week to consider if more monetary easing is needed
to support its economy.  “Germany’s ruling is an uncertain factor surrounding
Europe’s debt crisis for now, limiting risk appetite for
investors,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for Economic Research in Tokyo. “But sentiment is not so
weak and Asia is still seeing some fund inflows, providing a
floor for regional currencies. Investors are also waiting for
the results of the Fed’s meeting.”  The baht slid 0.1 percent to 31.11 per dollar as of 8:52
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 30.89 yesterday, the strongest level since May 4. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, was unchanged at 4.27 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 was
unchanged at 3.27 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
