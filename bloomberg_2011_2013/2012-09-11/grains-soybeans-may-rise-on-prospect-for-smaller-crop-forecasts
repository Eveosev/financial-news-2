What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher on speculation that the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
will reduce its forecast of this yearâ€™s drought-damaged domestic
crop,  Dave Marshall , a farm marketing adviser for Toay Commodity
Futures Group LLC in Nashville, Illinois, said by telephone.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
speculation that the USDA will cut overseas production forecasts
and raise demand estimates for U.S. supplies, Marshall said.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
speculation that the worst drought in more than 50 years damaged
more of the U.S. crop than forecast a month ago, Marshall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
