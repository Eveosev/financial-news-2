The permanent closure of
refineries, mainly in  Europe  and the U.S., is unlikely to boost
profits from processing crude into fuels as capacity is added in
other regions, according to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.  Capacity of about 3 million barrels a day will close by the
end of this year and under-utilization will remain “high,”
Vienna-based OPEC said today in a report.  “Despite the significant volume of closures, these
shutdowns are not likely to boost margins, as refining capacity
globally is projected to increase,” the report said. New
capacity of 1.3 million barrels a day globally will be added
this year and 1.7 million barrels in 2013, according to OPEC
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
