Apax Partners LLP and Trilantic
Capital Partners froze their bids to buy Euskaltel, a cable
company in  Spain â€™s Basque region, until regional elections are
held on Oct. 21,  El Confidencial  reported, citing unidentified
people close to the matter.  Private equity firms Apax and Trilantic want to see which
political party wins the elections because policies on items
such as phone bills, networks, investments and taxes could be
different from one party to another, the news website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
