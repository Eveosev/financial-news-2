Serbia will give all businesses
operating as part of  the “informal” economy three months to
register and start paying taxes, in a move that may expand the
official size of the economy by a fifth.  Entrepreneurs and companies can register by the end of
December and pay a 10 percent annual flat tax, Finance Minister
 Mladjan Dinkic  told reporters in Belgrade today.  Dinkic said “conservative estimates” put the share of the
black economy at one fifth of economic output.  The Cabinet of Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  is trying to
avoid bankruptcy and bolster tax collection as part of efforts
to stabilize public finances amid evidence that the country has
been hit by its second recession in three years.  The government is seeking to lower the cost of doing
business while bolstering financial discipline in a bid to
narrow its fiscal gap from an expected 6.7 percent of gross
domestic product at the end of 2012 to 4 percent of GDP in 2013.  “There will be no tax inspections until the end of
December, but after that, those who have not registered will
have their goods seized and will have to pay a 20 percent tax as
a penalty,” Dinkic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
