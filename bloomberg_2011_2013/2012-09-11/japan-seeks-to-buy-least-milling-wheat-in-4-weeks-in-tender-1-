Japan  is seeking to buy 112,441
metric tons of milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia

Forestry and Fisheries said in a statement today.  The volume sought is the smallest since Aug. 16, when the
government bought 70,865 tons, according to Toshiki Tojo at the
ministry’s grain-trade division. The ministry, which controls
overseas purchases and domestic sales to stabilize supply, has
bought 2.13 million tons through regular tenders this fiscal
year, compared with 4.65 million tons in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
