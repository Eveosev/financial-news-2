Russia  lifted its ban on cattle
from British Columbia,  Canada , because mad cow disease, also
known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is no longer a
concern there, Russian food safety watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor
said.  The ban on cattle from the western province dates back to
outbreaks of BSE in the country in 2003, Moscow-based
Rosselkhoznadzor said in an e-mailed statement today. The
Russian embargo was lifted in other parts of Canada in 2007.  BSE is a transmissible brain disease that is fatal for
cattle, according to the  World Health Organization . Eating meat
from BSE-infected animals has been tied to Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, an incurable human illness that destroys brain tissue.  The Canadian Embassy press officer in Moscow was not
available for comment when phoned after regular office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
