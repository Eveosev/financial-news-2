Russell Wasendorf Sr., accused by
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of misappropriating
about $200 million of customer money in the Peregrine Financial
Group Inc. futures brokerage, has provided “valuable
information” on the assets and liabilities of companies he
controlled to the CFTC and its chosen receiver, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the  Department of Justice  during 12
hours of interviews, the receiver said yesterday in a federal
court filing in Chicago.  Many of Wasendorf’s assets, which include a publishing
venture, an unprofitable restaurant, a boat, aircraft, cars and
4,000 bottles of wine, were bought or supported by funds
embezzled from customers, based on information the receiver said
he had obtained since the collapse of the brokerage in July.  Wasendorf has asked to be released from custody before
trial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
