Asian currencies rose to a four-
month high before the  Federal Reserve  meets tomorrow, with
investors looking for signs of further monetary easing that may
boost inflows into  emerging markets .  Central banks in South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia
are due to set  interest rates  this week as the euro-area
financial crisis damps demand for regional goods. The Fed will
probably keep borrowing costs near zero, according to a
Bloomberg survey, and decide whether additional bond purchases
are warranted to support the economy. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Index of shares dropped for the first time in four days ahead of
tomorrow’s ruling by Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court on
the country’s participation in a European bailout fund.  “Germany’s ruling is an uncertain factor surrounding
Europe’s debt crisis for now, limiting risk appetite for
investors,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for  Economic Research  in Tokyo. “But sentiment is not so
weak and Asia is still seeing some fund inflows, providing a
floor for regional currencies. Investors are also waiting for
the results of the Fed’s meeting.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s most-active currencies, advanced 0.2 percent to 116.03
and touched 116.05, the highest level since May 14. Malaysia’s
ringgit climbed 0.4 percent to 3.0892 against the greenback as
of 5:15 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur  and India’s rupee appreciated 0.1
percent to 55.3650, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
South Korea’s won gained 0.1 percent to 1,128.15 and Taiwan’s
dollar rose 0.1 percent to NT$29.715.  Flexible Yuan  Yuan  forwards halted a two-day advance after the central
bank weakened the daily fixing for the first time in four days.
The currency needs to depreciate a little to ease pressure on
exports, the China Securities Journal reported in a front-page
commentary published today. Overseas shipments must grow more
than 10 percent each month for the rest of 2012 to achieve a
full-year 10 percent growth target, it said.  The People’s Bank of China fixed the  reference rate  0.03
percent lower at 6.3391 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards traded at 6.4215 in Hong Kong, the same rate as
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts were
at a 1.4 percent discount to the spot rate of 6.3351 in  Shanghai .  “What the authorities are doing now is to make the yuan
more flexible,” said Eddie Cheung, a foreign-exchange analyst
at Standard Chartered Plc in  Hong Kong . “Whether we will see
exports growing another 10 percent or so, it’s quite a big
number” to achieve but a rebound in  China’s economy  later in
the year will help the currency resume appreciation, he said.  China’s  exports  rose 2.7 percent in August, compared with
the 1 percent pace the previous month and a 24.5 percent
increase a year earlier, official data showed yesterday.  Rate Decisions  Macquarie Group Ltd. cut China’s 2012 economic growth
estimate to 7.7 percent from an earlier prediction of 8.1
percent, analyst Chen Shao wrote in a research report yesterday,
saying inflationary pressures limit room for monetary easing.
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Nomura Holdings Inc. and Daiwa Capital
Markets also cut their forecasts.  Policy makers in  South Korea  will probably lower the
benchmark seven-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 2.75
percent on Sept. 13, according to 15 of 16 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg, with one predicting no change. In Indonesia and
the Philippines, borrowing costs are expected to stay at 5.75
percent and 3.75 percent, respectively, separate surveys show.  Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.1 percent
to 9,578 per dollar in Jakarta, according to prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg. Thailand’s baht was little changed
at 31.10, while the Philippine peso rose 0.1 percent to 41.570.
Vietnam’s dong held at 20,850.  To contact the reporter on this story:
