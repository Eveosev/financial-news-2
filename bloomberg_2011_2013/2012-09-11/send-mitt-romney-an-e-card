How much is a typo worth? In the domain-name online real estate market, at least $280 per letter. In politics, the price is measured more in embarrassment and news-cycle opportunity costs. As of Tuesday afternoon, accidentally typing someecards.co (instead of someecards.com) into your browser redirects you to  Mitt Romney ’s official “About” page, the Daily Dot  reports  today. The domain name is up for  auction  starting at $280. The  .co domain  used to be the online country code for Colombia, but since it became available to the public in June 2010, it’s become a popular alternative to the .com domain. It’s also the latest online space reminding politicians to claim their online presences, or pay the price. Vice presidential candidate  Paul Ryan  should take note. PaulRyan.com currently redirects to online retailer everestmusic.com. Go to PaulRyan.co, and you'll find a "for sale" ad. RomneyRyan.com takes you to a site critical of Romney with an offer to sell the domain name. Newt Gingrich  learned the lesson the hard way last December when Democratic group American Bridge 21st Century  posted  a Craigslist ad offering to sell NewtGingrich.com. The domain name continues to redirect to sites critical of the former House speaker. Texas Governor  Rick Perry  also got burned by domain-name games in the primaries. RickPerry.com used to  redirect  to  Ron Paul ’s official campaign site. Now, it goes to an ad to buy the domain name. President  Barack Obama  seems to have escaped domain-name attack so far. The mistyped domain names BarrackObama.com and barackobama.co are already taken, according to GoDaddy, a website that sells domain names, and don’t lead anywhere. But if a domain name is still on the market, it may be fair game to anyone willing to make a joke or turn a profit. After reading about the Someecards typo redirect, a friend of mine quickly bought Romeny.co. I’m sure he’d be willing to sell it to the Romney campaign -- for a price.
