Angola’s trade with  South Africa 
rose 14 percent through July to about $228 million a month,
mainly on oil shipments to Africa’s biggest economy, a business
group that promotes commerce between the two countries said.  Trade between the two southern African nations reached $1.6
billion by the end of July compared with $2.4 billion for all of
last year, said Teddy de Almeida, president of the Angola-South
Africa Chamber of Commerce.  “People were worried before the Aug. 31 elections and we
wanted to show to the business community the climate of
stability,” De Almeida said today in an interview in Luanda,
the capital. “Angola has oil and gas while trying to diversify,
and South Africa has many products like in construction, helping
us rebuild.”  President Jose Eduardo dos Santos’s ruling party won a
legislative election last month in Africa’s second-biggest oil
producer after Nigeria, extending his 33-year rule by five
years. Opposition parties have disputed some of the results
while saying they will accept their seats in Parliament.  Angola pumps about 1.8 million barrels a day from offshore
wells operated by  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  BP Plc (BP/)  and
 Total SA (FP) , among others. The country is rebuilding from a 27-year
war that ended in 2002.  To contact the reporters on this story:
