Croatia ’s  central bank  proposed
legislation requiring commercial banks to provide “objective”
criteria for rate changes in variable-rate consumer loans and
prohibit penalties for early payments.  Should a lender increase the interest rate on a variable
loan, borrowers would have three months to refinance the loan
with another institution without penalty, the Zagreb-based bank
said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  The move is aimed at increasing protection for borrowers
and strengthening competition and transparency among lenders,
the bank said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Jasmina
