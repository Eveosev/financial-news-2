Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , China’s third-
largest producer of solar cells, is separating its manufacturing
business and its power-plant development operations in an effort
to reduce costs after sales plunged.  The company announced the restructuring plan, which also
includes “some headcount reductions,” in a statement today.  Solar manufacturers are contending with a global glut
that’s driving down prices and eating into margins as
governments from  Europe  to the U.S. pare back support. Prices
for solar cells  fell  45 percent in the past year, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The company said last month that
it expected project development to boost revenue.  The job cuts will be “significant,” Thomas Young, vice
president of  investor relations  for Changzhou, China-based
Trina, said today in an interview, and many of the details
haven’t been finalized. “It’s a large task, obviously. You have
growth in some areas and transition in others.”  Trina reported second-quarter  sales  of $346.1 million on
Aug. 21, down 40 percent from a year earlier. It reduced its
forecast for 2012 shipments by as much as 17 percent as its
inventories and short-term debt both doubled.  JA Solar Holdings Co. was the largest provider of solar
cells last year followed by Suntech Power Holdings Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
