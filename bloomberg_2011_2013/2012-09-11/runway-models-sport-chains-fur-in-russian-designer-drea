Fashion designer  Leonid Gurevich  didn’t want me backstage.  Unlike many of his colleagues, who turn behind-the-scenes styling into its own spectacle, Russian-born Gurevich had a strict no-access policy for his New York runway show at the cavernous  Angel Orensanz Foundation  on Sept. 9.  “I never let anyone backstage,” he wrote by e-mail. “When I create a dream, I am not interested in anyone also seeing crumpled sheets, dentures in a glass and a chamber pot under a bed.”  Inside the foundation, a 19th-century Gothic-revival former synagogue on the Lower East Side, red light bathed the stone walls up to the vaulted ceiling. High above, the pointed arches were lit with blue, pink and purple. Women in floor-length gowns and men in fedoras sipped champagne.  Gurevich’s “Tribute” collection was a homage to the wasp- waisted Russian film star Lyudmila Gurchenko (1935-2011), who wore Gurevich’s theatrical creations during the last years of her life. It was one of the more than 300 shows and presentations during  New York  Fashion Week, which ends on Sept. 13.  “Femininity is focal point in my designs,” Gurevich said. “I am sick and tired of androgyny in fashion. I want to see women beautiful, feminine and above all enjoying the effect they create.”  Vivaldi Accordion  The show opened with a high-volume Vivaldi recording with live accompaniment by a handsome accordionist who fancied himself a rock star.  The runway models were at once revealing and concealing as each ensemble highlighted chest, waist and hips. Festooned with lace, feathers, fur, chains, crushed velvet and metallic brocades, the outfits wouldn’t have been out of place in a Broadway musical.  “The fairytales, the decorativeness have been important to him since he was a student. They are part of his Russian DNA,” said Daria Dorosh, Gurevich’s former fashion-design professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology.  Caviar Hat  The theatricality was heightened by the elaborate headpieces by  Anya Caliendo . One tilted hat was shaped as a can of black caviar, another as an ice-cream cone. There were also explosions of pink and white feathers, a sculpted flower garland and a traditional Russian pearl-encrusted kokoshnik.  “These dresses are for the elite and celebrities,” Gurevich said. “It’s couture. It’s not for the stores.”  Gurevich has worked for Zac Posen and has made clothes for socialite Daphne Guinness and model Amanda Lepore. Hip-hop singer Lil’ Kim wears one of his dresses on the cover of her “If You Love Me” single.  “He’s very glamour-heavy,” said Alina Fayerman, 25, a friend and client of the designer who attended the show. “He makes you feel sexy. Any time I wear his stuff, I get more compliments than when I wear Fendi or Cavalli.”  Muse highlights include  Jeremy Gerard  on theater, Laurie Muchnick on  books .
