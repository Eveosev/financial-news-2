Pakistan Telecommunication Co. (PTC) , the
country’s biggest phone service provider, reported a 36 percent
rise in annual net income because of higher revenue from
broadband services.  Net income rose to 11.4 billion rupees ($120 million) or
2.24 rupees a share in the 12 months ended June 30, from 8.41
billion rupees or 1.65 rupees a year earlier, the Islamabad-
based company said in a statement to the stock exchange today.
Revenue increased 8 percent to 110.8 billion rupees.  “Their broadband business grew this year because they
offered more products,” said Ayub Ansari, a research analyst at
AKD Securities Ltd. in Karachi.  The company’s focus on high-speed Internet and television
services has helped boost broadband customers to almost one
million contributing about 20 percent to total sales, Walid Irshaid, chief executive, said in October. Pakistan
Telecommunications has faced competition from telecom providers
including Telenor ASA and China Mobile Communications Ltd. since
2004 when the government allowed the entry of private operators,
ending a monopoly.  The company’s broadband business grew 44 percent from a
year earlier, Ansari said.  Pakistan Telecommunication’s shares fell by the daily limit
of 5 percent to 18.63 rupees because the company skipped a
dividend payment for the first time since the year ended June
2008, Ansari said. The shares have risen 81 percent this year
 compared  with a 38 percent gain in the benchmark KSE100 index.  Emirates Telecommunications Corp., the United Arab Emirates
state-owned phone company, won management control of Pakistan
Telecom in April 2006 after buying a 26 percent stake in the
company for $2.6 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
