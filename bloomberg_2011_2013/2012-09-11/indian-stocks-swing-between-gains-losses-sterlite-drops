Indian stocks climbed the most in
 Asia  before key economic data on factory output and inflation
this week, and ahead of a ruling on Germany’s participation in
an European bailout fund.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.5 percent
to 17,858.79, according to preliminary closing prices.  Housing
Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage lender, climbed
to its highest in about two years.  Tata Consultancy Services
Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software exporter, surged to a record.  India’s factory production may have risen in July, and
 inflation  probably quickened to more than 7 percent in August,
Bloomberg surveys show. Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court
is due to rule tomorrow on the country’s participation in the
European Stability Mechanism, while Greek politicians meet amid
an impasse on spending cuts needed for a bailout. The U.S.
Federal Reserve starts a two-day meeting tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
