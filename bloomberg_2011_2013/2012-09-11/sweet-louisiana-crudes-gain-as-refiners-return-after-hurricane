Sweet  Louisiana  crudes gained as
U.S. Gulf Coast refiners returned plants to operation that had
halted or reduced output because of Hurricane Isaac.  Phillips 66 workers are in the process of resuming
operations at the 247,000 barrel-a-day Alliance refinery in
Louisiana, the company said in a  statement  on its website today.
Restarts at Valero Energy Corp.’s Meraux and St. Charles
refineries in Louisiana are “progressing as planned,”  Bill
Day , a San Antonio-based spokesman, said in an e-mail today.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
widened $1.40 a barrel to $18.75, at 2 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the largest
premium since Aug. 24.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark added
25 cents to $17.35 a barrel.  Other crudes on the U.S. Gulf Coast weakened or were
unchanged. Poseidon’s  premium  narrowed 15 cents to $13.10. Mars
Blend’s premium decreased 40 cents to $12.70 a barrel over WTI.
Southern Green Canyon’s lost 20 cents to $11.10.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, was unchanged at $17
above WTI.  In  Canada , Syncrude’s premium to WTI weakened for the first
time in six sessions, losing $1.75 to $13.75 a barrel.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened $1.50 to $10 a
barrel below the U.S. benchmark. Bakken’s premium was steady at
$6.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
