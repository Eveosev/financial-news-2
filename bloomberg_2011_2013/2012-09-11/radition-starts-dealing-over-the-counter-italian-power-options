Tradition Financial Services
concluded its first over-the-counter Italian power option
transaction.  The deal was for a 1.75 euro-a-megawatt-hour call option on
the 2013 power contract for 50 megawatts at 72.10 euros ($92.71)
a megawatt-hour, the brokerage said today in an e-mailed
statement. The option expires on Dec. 20, Tradition Financial
said. Call options give the buyer the right to purchase at a
certain price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
