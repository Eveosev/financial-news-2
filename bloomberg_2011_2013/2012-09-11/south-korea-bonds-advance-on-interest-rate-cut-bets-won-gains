South Korea ’s three-year bonds rose
the most in more than two weeks on speculation the central bank
will reduce borrowing costs as global policy makers act to
support growth. The won advanced for a fourth day.  The  Bank of Korea  will lower its benchmark  seven-day
repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent on Sept. 13,
according to 15 of 16 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. One
predicted no change. Bonds also rose as Finance Minister Bahk
Jae Wan said today his comment on Sept. 4 that the nation may
avoid using active monetary policies to spur growth wasn’t
targeted at this week’s central bank meeting. European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  announced last week an unlimited
bond-purchase program while the  Federal Reserve  meets this week
to consider whether more easing is needed.  “With the ECB’s bond-buying plan and speculation the Fed
will perform a third round of quantitative easing, there are
expectations the Bank of Korea will act in line and ease
monetary policy,” said Lee Seung Hoon, a Seoul-based fixed-
income analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. “Local shares declining
is also supporting bonds.”  The  Kospi (KOSPI)  index of stocks fell for a second day. The yield
on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June 2015 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.77 percent in Seoul
in the biggest decline since Aug. 24, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. Three-year debt futures rose 0.07 percent to 106.25 and
the one-year interest-rate swap slid two basis points to 2.84
percent.  The nation’s  unemployment rate  rebounded from a seven-month
low to 3.2 percent in August, a separate survey showed before
data due tomorrow.  The won advanced 0.1 percent to 1,128.15 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,127.45
yesterday, the strongest since Aug. 10. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, slid 40 basis points to 6.05 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
