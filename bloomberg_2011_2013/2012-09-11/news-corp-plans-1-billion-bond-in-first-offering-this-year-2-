News Corp. (NWSA) , the owner of the Fox
television network and the Wall Street Journal, issued $1
billion of 10-year debt in its first sale of 2012.  The 3 percent notes, sold through the company’s News
America unit, yield 140 basis points, or 1.4 percentage points,
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds are rated Baa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, the third-lowest investment-grade level.
Proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate
purposes.  The company, based in New York, last tapped the corporate
bond market in July 2011, issuing $2.5 billion of debt in two
parts. Its $1.5 billion of 6.15 percent bonds due in February
2041 traded at 122.2 cents on the dollar to yield 4.73 percent
yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The media company, whose chairman is  Rupert Murdoch ,
reported a $1.55 billion quarterly loss last month as shrinking
advertising revenue led to a writedown of its Australian
publishing business. It said in June that it would separate its
publishing unit from its media and entertainment properties.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
