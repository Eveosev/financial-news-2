Soybean futures fell, capping the
longest slump in 10 months, on speculation that rain in the past
three weeks boosted U.S. crops as demand eases in  China , the
world’s biggest consumer. Corn declined to a six-week low.  About 32 percent of U.S.  soybeans  were rated good or
excellent as Sept. 9, up from 30 percent a week earlier,
government data showed yesterday. In August, China’s  imports 
posted the biggest drop since February 2011. Futures have surged
27 percent since the end of May as drought scorched U.S. crops.  “The rains probably helped to marginally boost soybean
yields,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures Group
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “There are some
signs of slowing Chinese demand for U.S. soybeans because of the
elevated  price levels .”  Soybean futures for November delivery declined 1 percent to
close at $17.015 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, dropping for a fifth straight session, the longest slide
since late October. Earlier, the price touched $16.9875, the
lowest since Aug. 21.  Macquarie Group Ltd. cut its 2012 economic growth estimate
for China to 7.7 percent from 8.1 percent. Banks and brokerages
including Barclays Plc and Nomura Holdings Inc. also have
reduced their forecasts, partly because of a decline in
industrial production.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to
settle at $7.7775 a bushel. Earlier, the most-active contract
touched $7.7525, the lowest since July 27.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5
billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
