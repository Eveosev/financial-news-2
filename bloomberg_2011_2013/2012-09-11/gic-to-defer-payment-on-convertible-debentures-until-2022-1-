MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the mortgage
insurer that breached regulators’ capital limits, said it would
defer an interest payment on $389.5 million of 9 percent
convertible debt until 2022.  The payment had been scheduled to be made Oct. 1 on the
junior subordinated debentures due in 2063, the Milwaukee-based
insurer said today in a regulatory filing.  MGIC is guarding capital after eight straight losses on
costs tied to soured home loans. The company has declined 53
percent this year on the New York stock exchange and fell 8
percent to $1.60 at 5:49 p.m. in extended trading.  “As long as no event of default with respect to the
debentures has occurred and is continuing, we have the option to
defer interest for one or more consecutive interest periods up
to 10 years without giving rise to an event of default,” the
company said in the filing.  The insurer previously deferred interest due in 2009 and
April 2010 and made the payments in October of 2010 with
proceeds from a stock offering, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
