Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said some distressed euro area countries’ revamps of
their labor markets may not be sufficient to boost growth and
improve competitiveness.  As the groundwork that has allowed German unemployment to
fall to a 21-year low was laid a decade ago, “the measures
introduced, particularly in  Spain , Italy and Greece, will not
lead to full-time employment overnight, particularly since the
devil is in the detail,” Dombret said, according to the text of
a speech delivered in Goettingen,  Germany , today.  “So, it’s not certain that the most recent changes are
enough to sufficiently improve the efficiency and permeability
of their respective labor markets,” he said.  The government in Spain, which is currently resisting
asking for more aid from  Europe ’s bailout fund in order to
trigger the European Central Bank buying of its bonds, cut
firing costs in February, changed wage-bargaining laws and ruled
that jobless people on benefits will have to offer community
service in an overhaul of labor rules aimed at tackling the 23
percent unemployment rate.  Dombret said that “efficient labor markets are a central
plank to overcoming the crisis” and that the ECB’s primary
contribution remains maintaining  price stability , not fixing
“government failures to stem problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
