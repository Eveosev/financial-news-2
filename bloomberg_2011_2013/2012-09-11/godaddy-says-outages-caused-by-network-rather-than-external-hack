Go Daddy Group, a widely used web
hosting and provider of website-name registration services, said
outages of its website and services yesterday were caused by
internal issues, and not an attack by hackers.  The Scottsdale, Arizona-based company, which says on its
website that it has more than 10.5 million customers and manages
more than 53 million Internet domain names, said service was
restored yesterday.  “The service outage was not caused by external
influences,” Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s interim chief executive
officer, said in a statement posted on GoDaddy.com “Once the
issues were identified, we took corrective actions to restore
services for our customers and GoDaddy.com.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
