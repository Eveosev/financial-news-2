Rosatom Corp.,  Russia ’s state-run
nuclear company, increased a claim against  Bulgaria ’s National
Electricity Co. to 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) for work on a
canceled nuclear power plant project on the Danube.  Atomstroyexport ZAO, a unit of Rosatom, increased its claim
from 58 million euros filed with the International Court of
Arbitration in Paris in 2011 to cover construction work and
production costs of the two canceled nuclear reactors, the
Moscow-based utility said on its website today.  Bulgaria canceled the project to build a 2,000-megawatt
nuclear power plant at Belene in northern Bulgaria on March 28
after failing to agree on its cost and find Western investors.
Bulgaria filed a 61 million-euro claim against Rosatom with an
arbitration court in Geneva 11 months ago, for the purchase of
old equipment.  Atomstroyexport was contracted in 2005 to build the plant
for an initial 4 billion euros. The project stalled because of a
lack of funds and a dispute about how much costs should increase
because of the delay.  The Fukushima accident after the March earthquake in  Japan ,
raised costs for improved safety measures and risk insurance by
an extra $2.1 billion, according to a report by the Balkans and
Black Sea Studies Center in Sofia.  National Electricity Co. spokeswoman Hristina Stoyanova was
not immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
