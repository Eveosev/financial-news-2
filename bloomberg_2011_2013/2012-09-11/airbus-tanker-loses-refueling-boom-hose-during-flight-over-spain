Airbus Military said a refueling
tanker due for delivery this month to the  United Arab Emirates 
lost a boom in mid flight over  Spain  yesterday.  The aircraft was performing a test flight when the boom
detached at about 7:30 p.m. and landed in a forest in the
province of Caceres, in central Spain. The boom was later
recovered by police, and the fallen part hasnâ€™t damaged any
property, spokeswoman Maggie Bergsma said today.  The aircraft returned to its base near Getafe, outside
 Madrid , and performed a normal landing, she said.  The Airbus A330 wide-body aircraft outfitted to work as a
military tanker was the first of three on order with the UAE. A
boom is a rigid hose that extends from the undercarriage of the
plane to feed a second aircraft with extra fuel so it can
continue flights without landing. Designed and built by Airbus,
the boom measures 11.6 meters (38 feet) when retracted and 18
meters when fully extended.  The incident is under investigation and Bergsma said she
had no information on whether the delivery will be postponed. It
is the second time since  Airbus Military  began building tankers
that a plane has lost a boom, with the first occurrence during a
refueling task on a plane built for Australia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
