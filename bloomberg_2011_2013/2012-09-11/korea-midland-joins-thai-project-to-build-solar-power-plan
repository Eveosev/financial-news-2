Korea  Midland Power Corp. joined a
Thai renewable energy project to build an 8 megawatt solar power
plant in the Southeast Asian country, according to the unit of
Korea’s monopoly power distributor.  Korea Midland signed a contract yesterday with  Toyo-Thai
Corp. PCL (TTCL) , a Thai construction company, and Siam Steel Grating
Group, a Thai utility equipment maker, to build the solar farm
in Ang Thong, one of the central provinces of Thailand, the
Seoul-based company said in a statement today.  The project will receive a 10-year subsidy of 8 baht (26
cents) per kilowatt-hour, and include the sale of power to the
Provincial Electricity Authority of Thailand, the statement
said. Investment estimates and time schedules weren’t provided.  South Korea’s power utilities are committing to boosting
the use of renewable energy after the government imposed a
mandatory quota this year to cut  carbon emissions .  Korea Midland forecast the Siam project will be counted as
its commitments to the use of renewables, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
