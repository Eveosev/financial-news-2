Roger Clemens  could pitch for the
last-place  Houston Astros  this season at the age of 50, team
owner  Jim Crane  told the  Association Press .  “We haven’t heard from Roger, so that’s still up in the
air,” Crane said about Clemens, a seven-time Cy Young Award
winner who recently made two starts for the Sugar Land Skeeters,
an independent minor league team outside Houston.  Crane told the AP that the Astros wouldn’t pitch Clemens,
who made his last Major League Baseball appearance in 2007,
against an opponent in playoff contention. Of the Astros’ 21
remaining games, 12 are at home, with games today and tomorrow
against the Chicago Cubs followed by a four-game series against
the Philadelphia Phillies. The Cubs and Phillies are both out of
playoff contention, while the Astros’ final two home opponents
this month -- the St. Louis Cardinals and Milwaukee Brewers --
are seeking to make the postseason.  “We’re just going to sit tight,” Crane told the AP when
asked if the Astros will pursue Clemens. “We’ll wait and see if
he calls us, but we might call him, who knows?”  Clemens, an 11-time All-Star, pitched 3 1/3 shutout innings
in his Atlantic League debut for  Sugar Land  on Aug. 25. Clemens
followed that up with 4 2/3 scoreless innings in his second
start on Sept. 7 and told reporters afterwards that he didn’t
think he’d be able to pitch in the majors this season because of
the time it takes him to recover between starts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
