Shenhua Group Corp., the world’s
biggest coal producer, will test energy-storage systems from
 Altair Nanotechnologies Inc. (ALTI)  at a wind farm in China.  The project will evaluate the ability of Altair’s  lithium-
titanate batteries  to retain electricity, the Reno, Nevada-based
storage company said today in a statement. It didn’t say how
much storage capacity will be installed or when it will begin
operation.  Altair is developing the storage system with Shenhua
Science & Technology and  National Institute of Clean-and-Low-
Carbon Energy , which are both units of Dongcheng, China-based
Shenhua Group.  Altair rose 3.2 percent to 64 cents at the close in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
