Recent  oil prices  are “not
helpful” for the global economy,  Daniel Yergin , chairman of IHS
Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said while attending the
 World Economic Forum  in Tianjin, China.  “These prices are not helpful for stimulating economic
growth,” said Yergin. “They’re not the main weight on the
global economy but they add weight. The fundamentals would
suggest lower prices but you have the Iranian wildcard and the
politics of it is just going to build up for the rest of the
year.”  Sanctions against Iran “have worked much more effectvely
than expected,” he said.  Crude for October delivery decreased as much as 40 cents to
$96.14 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and was at $96.21 at 9:35 a.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday rose 12 cents to $96.54, the highest close
since Aug. 22. Prices have climbed 24 percent since June 28.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
