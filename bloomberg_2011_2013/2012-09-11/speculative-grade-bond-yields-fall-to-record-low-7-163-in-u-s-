Yields on speculative-grade
corporate debt in the U.S. dropped to an unprecedented 7.163
percent yesterday, breaking the previous record set more than 15
months ago.  Borrowing costs on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
High Yield Master II index have declined from 8.465 percent at
the beginning of this year and a high of 22.651 percent in
December 2008. Yields broke the previous record of 7.187 percent
from May 19, 2011.  Yields are tumbling as issuers sell junk debt at the
fastest pace on record as default rates remain below historic
averages and the Federal Reserve pledges to keep borrowing costs
low into 2014. Demand is intense enough to lead Bank of America
Corp. analysts to say last month that prices were approaching
“bubble levels.”  Investors are “moving into riskier assets, with comfort
growing that the Fed is going to be there to keep rates low for
a decent amount of time,” Mark Pibl, head of credit strategy at
broker-dealer Cortview Capital Securities LLC, said in a
telephone interview. Inflows have led to funds “building for
many fixed-income investors over the last three months.”  Yields on junk debt compare with 2.996 percent for U.S.
investment-grade bonds as of yesterday, up from an unprecedented
2.978 percent on Sept. 3, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data show.  The benchmark 10-year Treasury rate reached 1.701 percent
yesterday, down from 1.876 percent at the end of last year,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Default Rates  “With rates where they are, people are looking to get any
yield they can,” Rob Crimmins, a  money manager  in  New York  at
RS Investments, which oversees $30 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “Default rates are pretty low, so it gets people
comfortable with the sector.”  The global default rate for high-yield debt will be at
least 1.7 percentage points below its historical average,
Moody’s said in a Sept. 10 report. The trailing 12-month rate
was 3 percent in August, compared with a historical average of
4.8 percent. Moody’s sees the rate at 3.1 percent by year-end.  High-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- by S&P.  The $52.4 billion deposited into high-yield funds globally
this year through Aug. 29, compares with $8.3 billion in 2011
and $31.5 billion in 2010, as measured by Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based EPFR Global.  Sales of high-yield debt in the U.S. this year total $208
billion, the fastest pace on record, according to Bloomberg
data.  “The potential return on high yield looks attractive in
current economic and financial market circumstances,” said
Edward Marrinan, macro credit strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Central bank policies
are clearly influencing market behavior. By compressing yields
across the term structure, central bankers are pushing investors
into riskier asset classes.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
