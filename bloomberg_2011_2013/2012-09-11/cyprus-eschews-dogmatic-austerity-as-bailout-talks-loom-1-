The Cypriot government seeks to
avoid “dogmatic” austerity measures that could damage social
cohesion as it prepares for talks with international lenders,
spokesman  Stefanos Stefanou  said.  “It is our conviction that the experience of battling the
crisis worldwide has proven that one-sided and dogmatic
austerity policies do not lead out of the crisis, but put
economies in a vicious circle,” Stefanou told reporters in
Nicosia today.  Cyprus on June 25 became the fifth country in the euro area
to seek external aid. Euro-area finance ministers agreed to
begin talks two days later. No amount was specified for the
rescue, which will encompass the public sector as well as banks.
Cyprus also sought assistance from the  International Monetary
Fund  and  Russia .  Neoklis Sylikiotis, the government minister for commerce,
industry and tourism, said last month that the communist-led
government is “opposed to indiscriminate, across-the-board
measures that lead to recession instead of growth.”  Cyprus is girding for talks with the so-called troika --
the European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the IMF -
- that oversees euro-area rescues.  A European Union official said yesterday that Cyprus needs
to submit a “more substantiated” aid request for the process
to move forward.  Once the government has drafted its proposal for the
troika, it will hold discussions with other political parties in
an attempt to forge a unified position, Stefanou said.  Cyprus hosts euro-area and EU finance ministers for
meetings on Sept. 14-15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
