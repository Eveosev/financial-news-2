Palm oil  declined to the lowest
level in more than three weeks on concern that declining exports
from Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest producer, may boost
stockpiles amid a seasonal pick-up in output.  The November-delivery contract dropped as much as 2 percent
to 2,878 ringgit ($928) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest level since Aug. 16, and ended the morning
session at 2,883 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur .  Stockpiles climbed to 2.12 million tons in August, the
highest level since October, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said
yesterday. Exports fell 15 percent to 1.43 million tons last
month from a year earlier, board’s data showed.  “We believe exports for the rest of the year will continue
to lag behind 2011,” Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance
Research Sdn., said in a report today. “This is owing to
weakness in global demand, especially China.”  China’s palm-oil imports may fall 5 percent to 5.6 million
tons in 2012 from 5.91 million tons last year, researcher
Grain.gov.cn said today.  Soybean futures for November delivery slid 0.2 percent to
$17.16 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for
December delivery was little changed at 56.62 cents a pound.
Soybean oil and palm oil are used in foods and fuels.  Palm oil for January delivery fell 0.6 percent to 7,966
 yuan  ($1,256) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month declined 0.2 percent to
10,040 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
