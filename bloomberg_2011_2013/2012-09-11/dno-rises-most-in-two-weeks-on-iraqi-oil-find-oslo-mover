DNO International ASA (DNO)  , the  oil
company  focused on the northern Iraqi region of Kurdistan, rose
the most in two weeks in Oslo trading after striking more oil at
one of its discoveries in the area.  The Oslo-based company rose as much as 3.6 percent, the
most since Aug. 28, and traded up 2.6 percent at 8.915 kroner as
of 2:33 p.m. in Oslo, making it the second- biggest gainer  on the
benchmark OBX index. DNO has climbed 19 percent this year.  Drilling at the Benenan-3 well at the field in northern
Iraq encountered movable oil in a rock formation that wasn’t
previously tested conclusively, DNO said in a statement. It is
testing the well to acquire more data and also said it is
continuing drilling at its Tawke field.  “Through these wells and others planned next year, the
company is targeting in excess of 500 million barrels of gross
unrisked oil and gas reserves, predominantly in Kurdistan,” said
Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani, DNO’s executive chairman. “Our drilling
campaign is aggressive, it is balanced between exploration and
development and it is consequential.”  Oil producers including Total SA, ExxonMobil Corp. and
Chevron Corp. have recently entered Kurdistan. DNO became the
first foreign company to drill for oil in  Iraq  since the 1970’s
after the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.  DNO maintained its goal to boost total capacity at the Tawke
field in the same region to 100,000 barrels a day by the end of
this year, it said Aug.22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
