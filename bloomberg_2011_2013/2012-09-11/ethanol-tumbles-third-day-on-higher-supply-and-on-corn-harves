Ethanol futures tumbled for a third
day as the U.S. corn harvest accelerates and on ample supplies
of the fuel from domestic output, stockpiles and imports.  Prices slipped to the lowest level in eight weeks as corn
costs dropped and as ethanol  output  in the week ended Aug. 31,
the most recent Energy Department data available, was at 829,000
barrels a day, up 4 percent from July 20, when production fell
to the lowest in at least two years, and  imports  averaged 34,000
barrels a day, compared with none a year earlier.  “Production has been up,” said Will Babler, a broker at
Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “Imports
have been continuing to come in. You have a few things kind of
pushing back against it.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery dropped 2.1 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $2.455 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the lowest price since July 11. Futures have gained 11
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 2
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.535 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive lost 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.60, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in Chicago slid 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.47 a
gallon and in  New York  the biofuel increased 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.565.  Corn for December delivery decreased 5.5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $7.7775 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline Price  Gasoline for October delivery rose 1.95 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.0435 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  The rise in gasoline stretches its  premium  to ethanol to
58.85 cents, the highest since June 15, from 54.8 cents
yesterday, making the biofuel more attractive to blend as
refiners stand to pocket the difference between the two fuels.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, climbed 2.6 percent to 2.98 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. They are credits that help the government track
whether refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
