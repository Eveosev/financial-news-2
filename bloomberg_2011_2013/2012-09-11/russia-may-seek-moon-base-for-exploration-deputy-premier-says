Russia should set up a permanent
moon base as a launch-pad for space exploration, Deputy Prime
Minister  Dmitry Rogozin  said.  “Russian astronauts learned how to function in conditions
of zero gravity, work in orbit and carry out necessary
experiments there,” Rogozin, who is in charge of industry,
defense and the space sector, told state-run Vesti-FM radio
today. “Why not set up a large base on the moon as a launch-pad
for further leaps in science?”  The Russian government is planning to spend 650 billion
rubles ($20.5 billion) between 2012 and 2015 to develop the
country’s space program. Russia is talking to  NASA  and the
 European Space Agency  about participating in two Mars
expeditions in 2016 and 2018, the Russian space agency chief,
Vladimir Popovkin, said in November.  Over the next decade, Russia will focus on the moon, with a
manned mission planned for 2020-2025, Popovkin said. A manned
Mars expedition may be possible after 2030, he added.  Newt Gingrich , who lost his bid for the Republican
nomination for U.S. president this year, had promised to set up
a permament moon base by the end of his second term if elected
to the White House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
