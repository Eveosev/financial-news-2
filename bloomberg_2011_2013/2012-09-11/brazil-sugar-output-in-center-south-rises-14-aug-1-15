Sugar output in  Brazil ’s center
south, the world’s largest producing region, rose 12 percent in
the second half of August after dry weather helped speed up cane
harvesting, industry association Unica said.  Mills in the region, where about a fifth of the world’s
sugar is produced, made 3.34 million metric tons of the
sweetener between Aug. 16 and Aug. 31, up from 2.97 million tons
a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Unica said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Ethanol output increased 10 percent to 1.92 billion liters
(507 million gallons).  The region’s mills processed 46.5 million tons of sugarcane
in the period, up from 40.7 million tons a year earlier. About
52 percent of the cane was turned into sugar, compared with 51
percent a year earlier. The rest was processed into ethanol.  Brazil’s center south will harvest at least 509 million
tons of sugarcane in the crop year that started April 1, Unica’s
chairman Pedro Parente said Aug. 22. That compares with 493.2
million tons in the previous season. Mills will increase sugar
output 5.8 percent to 33.1 million tons, Unica said April 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
