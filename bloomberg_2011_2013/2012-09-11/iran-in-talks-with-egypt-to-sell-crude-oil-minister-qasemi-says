Iran  is negotiating with  Egypt  to
sell crude oil to the North African nation, Iranian Oil Minister
Rostam Qasemi said.  “Necessary negotiations are underway between the two
sides,” Qasemi said without elaborating, according to a report
posted today on  Shana , the ministry’s website.  Egyptian Oil Minister Osama Kamal said last month’s visit
to Iran by his country’s President Mohamed Mursi will probably
open doors for economic cooperation between the two nations,
Egypt’s state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported Sept. 4.  Iran, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, is seeking new customers for its oil amid a
tightening of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and
European Union over its nuclear program. Iranian crude output
fell by 350,000 barrels a day in August to 2.75 million barrels,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Iran says it wants nuclear power for civilian use, while
the U.S. and its allies say the government in Tehran may be
pursuing atomic-weapons technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
