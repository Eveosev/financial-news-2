Russian state-run lender VTB Group
denied accusations of mismanagement by anti-corruption activist
Alexey Navalny in a  report  released by a U.K. research group.  “This report is full of lying, tendentious and unfounded
accusations prepared by people who are not professional
bankers,” VTB’s press service said in a statement today. “It’s
clear that the report was ordered and you need to look for
corruption in the Foundation for Fighting Corruption and the
Henry Jackson Society.”  The Henry Jackson Society and Navalny’s Foundation for
Fighting Corruption suggested that top managers at VTB may have
profited financially from a series of deals and accused the bank
of failing to carry out due diligence, including in the takeover
of  Bank of Moscow . Russian regulators agreed to provide a record
395 billion-ruble ($12.5 billion) bailout for Bank of Moscow in
July 2011 after VTB bought the city government’s 46.5 percent
stake in the lender and uncovered bad debts.  “It is crucial that international banking regulators take
a closer look at VTB’s activities and judge for themselves
whether the bank is fit to continue doing business in their
respective markets,” the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
