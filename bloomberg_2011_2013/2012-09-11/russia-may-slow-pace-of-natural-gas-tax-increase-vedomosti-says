Russia ’s Energy Ministry plans to
slow the rate of tax increases on natural gas extraction for OAO
Novatek and other independent gas producers,  Vedomosti said .  The proposal envisions the increases for independents
growing at the same rate as those paid by the state export
monopoly OAO Gazprom in 2017 to 2018, when domestic prices will
equal those for gas shipped abroad, Vedomosti said, citing two
state officials.  Earlier this year, Russia’s  Finance Ministry  proposed that
the extraction tax for independents reach Gazprom’s level by
2015, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
