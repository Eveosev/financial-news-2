Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital, a
Vancouver-based clean-tech investor, said it’s helping fund
Axine Water Technologies, a Canadian company that’s developed
new treatments for toxic organic pollutants in wastewater.  Chrysalix, an early-stage investor whose  backers  include
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) , said in a statement
that it led the financing round for Axine through its CELP III
Fund and was joined by the Business  Development Bank  of  Canada ’s
venture capital arm. Chrysalix gave no terms.  Axine’s technology has the possibility to replace “the
entire value chain of wastewater management,” Wal van Lierop,
president and chief executive officer of Chrysalix and chairman
of Axine, said today in an interview. “It’s a game-changer.”  “Toxic organic waste in water is a huge problem and I had
not seen any real solution for that,” van Lierop said.
Vancouver-based Axine’s electrolytic oxidation process is “very
novel, very simple” and can be added to existing wastewater
treatment plants.  With the boom in hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas,
treatment of wastewater will be particularly important, van
Lierop said. Using the technology, also known as fracking, at a
single oil or gas well requires the injection of as much as 5
million gallons of water, according to a McKinsey & Co.  report .  The technology will address a multi-billion-dollar
potential market and is expected to also be used by
municipalities and industries including pharmaceuticals,
chemicals, food and beverages, Chrysalix said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
