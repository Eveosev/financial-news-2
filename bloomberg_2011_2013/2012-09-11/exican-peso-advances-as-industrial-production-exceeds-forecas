Mexico’s peso rallied the most this
month as a report showed industrial production increased in July
more than analysts forecast, boosting the outlook for  Latin
America ’s second-biggest economy.  The currency appreciated 0.7 percent to 12.9874 per dollar
at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, the biggest gain since Aug. 31.  The peso extended its advance against the dollar this year
to 7.3 percent, the best performance among the greenback’s 16
most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  “Most people remain quite constructive on Mexico,”
 Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America currency strategist at
Scotiabank, said in a telephone interview from Toronto. Mexico’s
industrial production “is outperforming even its trading
partners.”  Output expanded 4.9 percent in July from a year earlier,
the fastest pace since February, the national statistics agency
reported. The median forecast of 15 economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for a 3.9 percent increase.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated debt due in 2024
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.66
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell
0.40 centavo to 138.27 centavos per peso.  Mexico sold all 7 billion pesos ($539 million) of 28-day
Cetes and 8 billion pesos of the 91-day securities offered
today, the central bank said on its website.  Mexico  also sold
all 9 billion pesos in 175-day bills it auctioned, the bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
