Oki Electric Industry Co., the
Japanese telecommunications-equipment maker put on delisting
watch, said the overstatement of accounts by its Spanish unit
will reduce  net income  by 30.8 billion yen ($395 million).  The impact is from the overstatement, unrecognized debt and
money set aside for potentially uncollectable accounts at Oki
Systems Iberica in the six years and three months through June
30, the company said today in a statement in Tokyo, where it’s
based. Oki plans to correct its earnings Sept. 14.  Oki, with customers including International Business
Machines Corp., will review ways to oversee its units and
rebuild its internal control, according to the statement. The
company was put on watch for a possible delisting by the Tokyo
bourse last month after the company said its Spanish unit
overstated accounts receivables, prompting the biggest one-day
decline in shares in at least 37 years.  The company fired the head of its Spanish unit and will
consider a legal action, Hideichi Kawasaki, president and chief
executive officer, told reporters in  Tokyo . Kawasaki didn’t name
the head of the Spanish unit.  The stock fell 2 percent to 100 yen in Tokyo trading before
the announcement.  Last month, the company said the overstatement by the
Madrid-based unit will trim earnings by about 8 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
