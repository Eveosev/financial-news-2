Commodities surged from a bear to a
 bull market  in anticipation of economic stimulus measures from
the  Federal Reserve , completing the fastest turnaround since the
depths of the financial crisis starting in 2008.  Within 11 weeks the Standard & Poor’s GSCI spot  index  rose
22 percent from its 2012 low, stoked by falling supplies of oil
and grains and speculation that the European Union will
successfully end its sovereign debt crisis. The gauge of 24 raw
materials soared to a record high four years ago before plunging
as the U.S. slid into the deepest recession since the 1930s.  After the jobless rate stayed at more than 8 percent for 43
months, traders are speculating that Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will unveil a third round of so-called quantitative
easing as soon as this week. Corn prices advanced to an all-time
high last month after the worst U.S. drought since 1956 and oil
is climbing amid mounting tension over  Iran’s nuclear program .  “There have been a lot of moving parts within the
 commodities markets  this year,”  Jim Paulsen , chief investment
strategist in Minneapolis at Wells Capital Management, which
oversees $320 billion, said in a telephone interview. “We are
turning a corner. The surprise is going to be that global growth
is going to accelerate.”  Commodities Rising  The S&P GSCI Agriculture Index rose 33 percent after
dipping to a 2012 low on June 15, and the S&P GSCI Energy Index
advanced 25 percent from its bottom for the year on June 21. Oil
rebounded 25 percent to $97.17 a barrel from a 2012 low on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  on June 28, and corn surged 54
percent to $7.7775 a bushel since June 15 on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Energy and agriculture together make up more than 85
percent of the S&P GSCI.  West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark,
will average $94 a barrel in the fourth quarter, according to
the median of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Corn
will cost $7.19, according to the median of eight forecasts.  In 2008, the S&P GSCI climbed 46 percent from January to an
all-time high July 3. Oil advanced to an intraday record $147.27
that month and corn surged as much as 75 percent in the first
half of that year to intraday peak of $7.9925. The index then
plunged to a four-year low on Feb. 18, 2009, as the credit
crisis worsened following the September collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. Within a month, the gauge had rebounded
21 percent.  “Commodities spent from October 2007 until July 2008
climbing up,” Jeff Currie, head of commodities research for
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in  New York , said by phone. “When you
think of the run-up this year, it happened in three weeks in
February. And the run-down happened in five weeks in May and
June.”  Jackson Hole  The market boomed after Bernanke signaled the central
bank’s last round of quantitative easing, known as QE2, in an
 Aug. 27, 2010 , speech to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas
City’s annual economic symposium in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming . His
remarks and the subsequent Nov. 3, 2010 unveiling of a $600
billion plan to buy Treasuries spurred an eight-month rally in
commodities, with the S&P GSCI advancing 51 percent by April 8,
2011, to 760.33.  At the same meeting last month he said he wouldn’t rule out
steps to lower a jobless rate he described as a “grave
concern.” Market expectations for additional central bank
stimulus rose to 99 percent in August, the highest ever,
according to Citigroup Inc.  ECB Action  The Fed’s efforts have coincided with those of the  European
Central Bank , which is struggling to contain a sovereign debt
crisis that has tipped six euro-region countries, including
Spain, Italy and Greece, into recessions. The S&P GSCI jumped
5.6 percent on June 29 after the EU unveiled a 120 billion-euro
aid plan.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on Sept. 6 that policy
makers agreed to an unlimited debt-purchase program to curb
borrowing costs and fight speculation of a currency breakup.  A deterioration of the global economy may erode demand,
stifling the rally. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said yesterday that world oil consumption growth will
decline to 800,000 barrels a day in 2013, from 900,000 a day
this year.  “Downside risk exists as the economic slowdown in the
developed countries could increasingly spill over” into
emerging economies, the group’s Vienna-based secretariat said.  Iron ore  prices fell to $86.70 a so-called dry ton on Sept.
5, the lowest since October 2009, as demand from  China  slowed.
The world’s second largest economy and biggest user of the
steel-making ingredient expanded 7.6 percent in the second
quarter, the slowest pace in three years, the National Bureau of
Statistics said July 13.  ‘Underlying Demand’  “Without any stimulus I don’t think that underlying demand
is very strong,”Nic Johnson, a  money manager  who helps oversee
about $30 billion in commodities at Pacific Investment
Management Co. in  Newport Beach ,  California , said by phone. “I
don’t see the case for a rally from a sustained organic
improvement in global growth.”  Prices have been lifted as forecasts of supply have ebbed.
Corn surged to an intraday record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10
after scorching heat forced the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
to cut harvest expectations. The department had predicted a
record crop on June 12.  Soybeans have advanced 47 percent to $17.015 a bushel from
this year’s low on Jan. 13. The price touched an intraday record
of $17.89 on Sept. 4. Wheat has jumped 49 percent to $8.8375 a
bushel from a 2012 bottom on Jan. 18.  Iranian Embargo  Oil climbed to $97.17 after a European Union embargo on
Iranian crude went into force on July 1, raising concern that
the Islamic republic will try to close the  Strait of Hormuz , the
transit point for almost 20 percent of the world’s crude. Iran’s
 exports  fell 23 percent this year through August, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Natural gas rose as Hurricane Isaac roared toward the U.S.
Gulf Coast last month. The region is home to 7 percent of the
fuel’s production, according to the Energy Department. At its
peak on Aug. 30, the storm shut in 73 percent of output,
according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.
Futures increased 57 percent to $2.992 per million British
thermal units from a decade-low on April 19.  Gasoline has gained 19 percent to $3.0435 a gallon on the
Nymex since falling to a 2012 low on June 21. Retail prices
advanced to $3.843 a gallon on Sept. 10, the highest since April
23, according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the largest U.S.
motoring organization.  “Commodity prices are poised for a good second half,”
 Harry Tchilinguirian , BNP Paribas SA’s head of commodity-markets
strategy in  London , said by phone. “After the risk-off
correction in the first half of this year, global monetary
policy easing alongside individual supply constraints provide a
positive outlook for commodities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
