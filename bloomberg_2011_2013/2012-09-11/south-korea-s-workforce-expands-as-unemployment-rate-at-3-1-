South Korea ’s workforce expanded
last month, with the  unemployment rate  unchanged from July even
as  Europe ’s debt crisis capped demand for exports.  The  jobless rate  was at 3.1 percent in August, unchanged
from the previous month, Statistics  Korea  said today in
Gwacheon, south of Seoul. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 14 economists was for a rate of 3.2 percent. The
number of employed people increased by 364,000 or 0.2 percent,
to 24.9 million last month from a year earlier.  South Korea’s government this week announced 5.9 trillion
won ($5.2 billion) of measures to support growth as Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis and a slowdown in China drive down
exports. The  Bank of Korea  will give the economy an additional
boost by cutting the benchmark by a quarter point to 2.75
percent on Sept. 13, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “It is necessary for policy makers to reignite growth,”
Ronald Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc, said
before today’s release.  The won rose 0.1 percent to close at 1,128.15 against
dollar in Seoul yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The benchmark Kospi stock index fell 0.2 percent.  This week’s measures included extra spending and tax cuts
intended to boost the housing market and car sales. Some 4.6
trillion won is allocated for this year, without any expansion
of the government’s budget, and 1.3 trillion won for 2013.  South Korea’s government is holding off from larger fiscal
stimulus to preserve ammunition for any deeper global slowdown.
Asia’s fourth-largest economy expanded 2.3 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in almost three
years, and exports fell 6.2 percent in August.  The seasonally unadjusted jobless rate was 3 percent in
August, from 3.1 percent in July, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
