Authorities in Gaza are urging the
Egyptian government to let shipments of Qatari fuel to the strip
resume, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported today.  Egypt  blocked Qatari fuel from entering Gaza after an
attack on a border post near the Rafah crossing in Sinai that
killed 16 soldiers on Aug. 5, Cairo-based MENA said. Gaza is
suffering a fuel shortage of as much as 50 percent, the news
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
