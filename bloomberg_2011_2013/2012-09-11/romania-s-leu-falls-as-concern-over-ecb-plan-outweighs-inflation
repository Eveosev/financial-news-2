The leu weakened as concern the
 European Central Bank ’s bond-buying plan may be derailed
outweighed a rise in Romania’s inflation rate.  The leu depreciated 0.4 percent to 4.4898 per euro by 6
p.m. in Bucharest, erasing yesterday’s gains, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on the country’s 2018 euro-
denominated bonds rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 4.748 percent.  Investors’ concern over the success of the ECB’s program
increased after  Mariano Rajoy , Spain’s prime minister, said late
yesterday he won’t allow the European Union or the ECB to
stipulate how the nation narrows its  budget deficit  as a
condition for buying the country’s bonds. Romania’s inflation
rate climbed for a third month in August to the fastest in a
year at 3.9 percent, exceeding the 3.7 percent median estimate
of eight economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The inflation data “had no immediate impact on the leu,
but might eventually prove favorable, as it could fuel
expectations of tighter liquidity conditions,” Vlad Muscalu, a
senior economist at ING Groep NV in Bucharest, wrote in an e-
mailed note today.  Germany ’s Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe will
decide tomorrow whether to halt the country’s participation in
the 500 billion-euro ($640 billion) European stability
Mechanism, the euro-area’s permanent bailout fund.  Romania  sends
about 74 percent of its exports to the European Union countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
