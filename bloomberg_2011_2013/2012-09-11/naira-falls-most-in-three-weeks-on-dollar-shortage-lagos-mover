The naira weakened for a second day
on the Nigerian  interbank market , heading for its biggest fall
in three weeks, as import demand for dollars exceeded supply.  The currency of  Africa ’s top oil producer fell 0.4 percent
to 158.18 a dollar as of 11:33 a.m. in Lagos, the commercial
capital, the biggest decline on a closing basis since Aug. 20,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $180 million at a twice-
weekly foreign-currency auction yesterday, the lowest since Aug.
29. The West African nation relies on imports to meet more than
70 percent of domestic fuel needs because of a lack of refining
capacity, according to the Petroleum Ministry.  “Strong import demand, and a structural imbalance between
dollar supply and demand” put pressure on the Nigerian
currency, Ecobank Transnational Inc. strategists, led by Paris-
based Paul-Harry Aithnard, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Nigerian benchmark Bonny Light crude, which has risen 27
percent from a June low this year, snapped two days of gains,
falling 0.2 percent to $115.11 per barrel.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s 7 percent domestic bonds due 2019
dropped 42 basis points, or 0.42 percentage point, to 13.36
percent, according to yesterday’s data on the Financial Markets
Dealers Association website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million
of Eurobonds due 2021 slid 1 basis point to 4.84 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi snapped four days of gains, falling by 0.1
percent to 1.9005 a dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
