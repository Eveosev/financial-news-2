European stocks  climbed as
Germany’s top constitutional court said it will proceed with a
ruling on the country’s role in the euro-area bailout fund and
speculation grew that the  Federal Reserve  will boost stimulus.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Europe’s biggest lender by assets,
advanced 4.1 percent after saying it will cut jobs and review
pay practices to boost profitability.  IG Group (IGG)  Holdings Plc
jumped 6.5 percent after saying first-quarter sales were in line
with forecasts. Burberry Group Plc plunged by a record 21
percent after forecasting full-year profit will be at the lower
end of analyst estimates.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  added 0.3 percent to
272.58 at the close of trading, the highest level in three
weeks. The measure has surged 11 percent this year as European
Central Bank policy makers agreed on an unlimited bond-buying
program and speculation grew that the Fed will announce a third
round of quantitative easing.  “Central banks seem to be more committed to do what it
takes to provide the stimulus required both in Europe and the
U.S.,” said  Henk Potts , an equity strategist at Barclays Plc’s
wealth-management division in London, which oversees $239
billion. “We expect to see a commitment to another round of QE
from the Fed.”  The Fed will give its latest policy statement on Sept. 13,
following a two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. On
Aug. 31, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. central bank
will provide further stimulus as needed to cement a recovery,
citing his concern about the jobless rate.  Court Decision  Tomorrow, Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court in
Karlsruhe will decide whether to halt the country’s
participation in the 500 billion-euro ($640 billion) European
Stability Mechanism, the euro area’s permanent bailout fund. A
bid by German lawmaker Peter Gauweiler to get the hearing
delayed after the ECB pledged unlimited funds to buy government
debt failed today.  “The market expects a lot from the decisions this week by
the German court and the Fed,” said Pierre Mouton, a portfolio
manager who helps oversee $6 billion at Notz Stucki & Cie. in
Geneva. “The German court will probably approve the draft with
restrictions.”  Parliamentary elections are due to be held in the
Netherlands tomorrow, and euro-area finance ministers are
meeting in Cyprus on Sept. 14.  National benchmark indexes rose in 15 of the 18 western
European markets. France’s CAC 40 advanced 0.9 percent and
Germany’s DAX Index rallied 1.3 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was
little changed.  Soros Comments  Billionaire investor  George Soros  said German-led austerity
demands worsen the debt crisis and risk pushing Germany into a
depression that’s already taking hold of the euro area’s rim.  A policy of fiscal retrenchment “is pushing Europe into a
deeper and longer depression,” Soros said during a speech in
Berlin yesterday. “The German public doesn’t yet feel it and
doesn’t quite believe it, but it’s all too real in the periphery
and it will reach Germany in the next six months or so. My
message is that the looming depression is largely self-inflicted
and the nightmare can be escaped.”  Deutsche Bank gained 4.1 percent to 33.15 euros after
saying it plans to cut costs by 4.5 billion euros to help boost
after-tax return on equity to at least 12 percent by 2015 from
8.2 percent in 2011. The lender will reduce headcount by more
than the 1,900 jobs it had announced in July, co-Chief Executive
Officer  Juergen Fitschen  said.  Banks Rally  A gauge of banking shares was the best-performing group in
the Stoxx 600.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  added 1.8 percent to 6.18
euros in  Madrid , while France’s  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  climbed 2.2
percent to 39.01 euros. Barclays Plc gained 2.8 percent to 213.5
pence, a four-month high.  IG Group climbed 6.5 percent to 461.7 pence, the largest
jump since November. The owner of the IG Index financial spread-
betting brand posted first-quarter revenue of 81.5 million
pounds($131 million) in the three months ended Aug. 31 and said
2012 sales will be weighted towards the second half.  Fiat SpA (F) , Italy’s largest automaker, advanced 1.6 percent
to 4.66 euros and  Daimler AG (DAI)  gained 1.5 percent to 39.36 euros.
A measure of auto-industry shares had the second-biggest advance
of 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Burberry (BRBY)  plummeted 21 percent to 1,088 pence, the largest
decline since its initial public offering in July 2002.
Britain’s biggest maker of  luxury goods  said adjusted pretax
profit in the year through March will be at the lower end of
analyst estimates, which range from 407 million pounds to 454
million pounds.  Luxury Goods  Rival luxury-goods companies Hugo Boss AG and Cie.
Financiere Richemont SA sank 8 percent to 70.91 euros in
Frankfurt and 5.1 percent to 60.85 Swiss francs in Zurich,
respectively.  Christian Dior SA (CDI)  and  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA (MC)  dropped 4.1 percent to 112.50 euros and 3.4 percent
to 127.80 euros.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the biggest maker of  wind
turbines , dropped 6.1 percent to 43.80 kroner. Credit Suisse
Group AG said the company may undertake a one-for-one rights
offer with a 50 percent discount to the current share price.  A  gauge of mining companies  dropped the second-most among
the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600, falling 0.7 percent.
Macquarie Group Ltd. cut its forecast for Chinese gross domestic
product growth in 2013 to 7.5 percent from 8.1 percent.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , producers of
copper listed in London, retreated 2.4 percent to 978.5 pence
and 1.8 percent to 1,226 pence, respectively.  Enagas SA (ENG)  sank 7.8 percent to 14.52 euros, the biggest drop
since 2006, as investor Sagane Inversiones sold a 5 percent
stake in the operator of Spain’s natural-gas grid. The shares
were sold for 14.70 euros apiece, according to a filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
