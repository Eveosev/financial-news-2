Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, promoted Andrew Gelb to  North America  head for
treasury and trade solutions, a unit with more global revenue
than equity trading and investment banking combined.  Gelb, 42, replaces Amol Gupte, who will lead the
transaction-services business in the Asia-Pacific region, New
York-based Citigroup said today in a statement. Gelb will report
to Julie Monaco, North America head of transaction services, and
Naveed Sultan, global head of treasury and trade solutions.  Sultan’s unit, known as TTS, is part of Citigroup’s global
transaction-services division, which handles more than $3
trillion of transactions every day. Gelb has worked in the
division for almost 15 years, including roles in London,  New
York  and Tokyo, the bank said.  “The North America region represents a tremendous
opportunity for our TTS franchise,” Sultan said in the
statement. “Andrew’s extensive international experience will
allow him to bring our globality to our clients to service their
financial and commercial flows in and out of North America.”  Global  revenue  at the TTS unit increased 10 percent to
$4.17 billion for the first six months of 2012, compared with
the same period in the prior year. The figure exceeded the $4.08
billion in combined revenue at the lender’s equity-trading,
 investment banking  and private banking operations for the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
