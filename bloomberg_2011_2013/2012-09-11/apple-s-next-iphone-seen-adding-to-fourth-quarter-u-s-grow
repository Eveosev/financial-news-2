Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s next iPhone could
contribute as much as one-half a percentage point to U.S.
economic growth in the fourth quarter, according to an analysis
by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   Apple may sell as many as 8 million iPhones in the U.S. in
the final three months of the year, boosting gross domestic
product by about $3.2 billion, or $12.8 billion on an annual
rate,  Michael Feroli , an economist at JPMorgan, wrote in a
report titled “Can One Little Phone Impact GDP?”  Apple, on Sept. 12, will announce a new version of the
iPhone that features a bigger screen and compatibility with
faster next-generation wireless networks, people with knowledge
of the matter have said. Feroli said there’s precedent for
Apple’s handset boosting the economy. After the iPhone 4S was
introduced last year, overall U.S. retail sales “significantly
outperformed expectations,” bringing as much as two-tenths of a
percentage point boost to GDP growth, he said.  The iPhone model to be introduced this week is expected to
be “much larger” than last year’s device, he said. Feroli, who
is JPMorgan’s chief U.S. economist, is predicting the U.S.
economy will expand about 2 percent in the fourth quarter, with
the iPhone limiting “downside risk.” Still, he cautioned that
his estimates should be “treated skeptically.”  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, fell 2.6 percent to
$662.74 in  New York  trading today. The shares have risen 64
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
