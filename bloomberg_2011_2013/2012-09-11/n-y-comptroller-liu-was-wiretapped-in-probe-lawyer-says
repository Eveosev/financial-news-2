New York City Comptroller  John
Liu ’s phone conversations were wiretapped as part of a federal
investigation of his campaign fundraising, according to court
filings today by a lawyer for a fundraiser who has pleaded not
guilty to criminal charges.  In a request to dismiss the charges in federal court in
Manhattan, the fundraiser, Xing Wu “Oliver” Pan, said he was
coerced by FBI agents to participate in undercover eavesdropping
of Liu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
