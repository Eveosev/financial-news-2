Sweden ’s government will spend a
total of 11.5 billion kronor ($1.74 billion) in additional funds
on research and development with a focus on life sciences from
2013 to 2016.  The spending will rise yearly starting in 2013 to about 4
billion kronor by 2016, the government said in a  statement  today
in Stockholm. The government will this year spend about 30
billion kronor on research and developments, or about 0.9
percent of gross domestic product.  The plan is one of the investments Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt ’s government has promised to boost the potential of
the largest Nordic economy ahead of elections in 2014. It last
week announced road and railway investments in the north of
Sweden to boost export capability. Next year’s fiscal policy
will be presented on Sept. 20.  Reinfeldt has come under pressure from the Social Democrat-
led opposition for not spending enough to stimulate an  economy 
whose exports to  Europe  remain at risk as the region’s debt
crisis drags on. The premier’s four-party coalition has 42.8
percent backing, versus 50.1 percent for the opposition,
according to a Novus Opinion and TV4 poll published Aug. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
