Sugar, trading near a two-year low,
is set to pile up in producing countries next season as a lack
of demand amid a global surplus forces growers to hold back
supplies, according to Kingsman SA.  “Sellers will struggle to get buyers for raw sugar in the
season starting October,”  Jonathan Kingsman , chief executive
officer of the Lausanne, Switzerland-based researcher and
broker, said in an interview in  New Delhi . “ Indonesia  will be
the biggest raw sugar importer in the absence of Russia and
 China . Prices will remain under pressure in the next six to 12
months on excessive supplies.”  Futures dropped to a two-year low in  New York  last week
after drier weather in  Brazil , the world’s biggest producer of
the sweetener, accelerated harvesting, while improvement in
rains last month in  India  improved crop prospects, the second-
largest grower. The sweetener has declined 31 percent in the
past year on expectations that global supplies will top usage.  Supplies will exceed demand by 8.7 million metric tons in
the 2012-2013 season, below a June forecast of 9.3 million tons,
Kingsman said Aug. 31. That follows a surplus of 10.1 million
tons in the current season.  “Sugar will have to be stored on lack of demand,”
Kingsman, who has traded the sweetener for more than three
decades, said yesterday. “Stockpiling will be at the sources,
not at the destinations.”  Brazil Harvest  Societe Generale SA cut its forecast for raw-sugar futures
in the fourth quarter by 2 cents to an average of 21.5 cents a
pound as dry weather allowed the harvest to accelerate in
Brazil, analysts led by  Michael Haigh , New York-based global
head of commodities research, said in a report yesterday.  Output from Brazil’s center south region, the main
growing region, may climb to 35.8 million tons in the 2013-2014
crop season from 32.8 million this year, said Kleber Andrioli,
an analyst at  Macquarie Bank . Exports may increase to 25.5
million tons next year from 22.7 million tons, and futures may
average 16 cents a pound, he said.  Raw sugar for October delivery was little changed at 19.42
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York at 5:34 p.m. in
Mumbai. The price touched 18.81 cents on Sept. 6, the lowest
since August 2010.  Global production will be 180 million tons in the year
starting in October, compared with 177.6 million tons this
season, according to Kingsman. Consumption is forecast to total
171.3 million tons, exceeding 167.5 million tons this season,
the researcher said last month. Demand may increase by a further
32 million tons by 2020, Kingsman told an annual industry
conference in New Delhi today.  Indian Exports  India, which is exporting sugar for a second year, may have
a surplus of 2 million tons for shipments next year,  Vinay
Kumar , managing director of the  National Federation of
Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd. , said in an interview. The
country will have sufficient supplies to meet demand, allowing
exports for a third year, Food Minister K.V. Thomas said.  Production in India may total 24.5 million tons in
2012-2013, compared with a local demand of 22.5 million tons,
Kumar said. The nation is set to produce 26.2 million tons in
the year ending Sept. 30, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
