Gannett Co. (GCI) , the owner of
television stations and 82 daily newspapers including USA Today,
jumped the most in more than two months as the  U.S. presidential
election  helps spur demand for advertising.  Gannett, based in McLean, Virginia, rose 4.3 percent to $17
at the close in New York, the biggest gain since June 26.  The stock is undervalued, partly because investors
overstate Gannett’s dependence on the declining print industry,
said James Goss, an analyst with Barrington Research Associates
Inc. in Chicago. Gannett’s local TV stations have benefited from
demand for advertising during the Olympics and the presidential
race, he said. Gannett also has a controlling stake in the jobs
website CareerBuilder.com.  “This has been a value name for us,” said Goss, who
recommends buying the shares. “They’re not just dependent on
print circulation.”  Shares of the company, which is marking the 30th
anniversary of  USA Today  this month, have climbed 27 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
