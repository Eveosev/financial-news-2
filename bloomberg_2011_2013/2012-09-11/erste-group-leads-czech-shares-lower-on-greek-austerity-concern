Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led a drop for
Czech shares on renewed concern that the euro area will fail to
contain its debt crisis and as more signs of China’s economic
slowdown drove investors from riskier assets.  The Austrian lender’s stock fell 2.3 percent to 425.2
koruna by 9:50 a.m. in  Prague , after jumping 11 percent in the
previous four sessions to the highest since April. The  PX (PX)  equity
index, where Erste has a 21 percent weighting, slid 0.8 percent.  Banks were among the biggest stock decliners in Europe as
Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras failed to secure support
from coalition partners on 11.5 billion euros ($14.7 billion) of
spending cuts required by the country’s lenders to release funds
needed to keep it in the euro.  “Greek Premier Samaras did not agree on more austerity
with coalition partners, which is reigniting nervousness in the
market,” Tomas Mencik, an analyst at Cyrrus AS brokerage in
Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in a report to clients today.  Erste’s previous rally lifted the stock’s 14-day relative
strength index to 70 yesterday, a level suggesting to technical
analysts that an asset may be overbought and poised for a drop.
