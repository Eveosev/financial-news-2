Russian state-owned companies
should “in most cases” pay 25 percent of profit as dividends
to the budget, Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  said in
an interview in London today.  “The government has decided that we should have some rules
regarding dividends,” Dvorkovich said. “We should have in most
cases 25 percent of profit going as dividends to the  federal
budget . Any deviation from the rule can only be based on the
decision of the prime minister.”  Russia’s Economic Development Ministry is seeking
government backing for a plan to require state-controlled
companies to pay 25 percent of their profit under International
Financial Reporting Standards in dividends, the ministry’s press
service said by e-mail on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
