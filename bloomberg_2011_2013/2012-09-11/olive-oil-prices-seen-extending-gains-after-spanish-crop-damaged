Olive  oil prices  are forecast to
extend gains after drought caused a harvest failure in  Spain ,
the biggest exporter, industry researcher Oil World said.  World output of the oil used in cooking and salad dressings
may fall 18 percent to 2.96 million metric tons in the year
through September 2013 from 3.6 million tons a year earlier, the
Hamburg-based researcher wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Spain had its second-hottest August since 1961, continuing
a pattern of hot and dry weather that left April the only month
this year that was wetter than usual, according to the country’s
 Agriculture Ministry . Olive oil prices there jumped 40 percent
in the past 10 weeks, Oil World said.  “ Severe drought  is taking its toll on olive trees as well
as other agricultural crops,” Oil World wrote. “Trees had
already been stressed by the unusually high production of the
three seasons to 2011-12, but the sharp decline in next season’s
yields has been enforced by the dryness and heat this year.”  Spanish olive-oil production may slide 37 percent in the
year through September 2013 to 1.08 million metric tons from
1.73 million tons in 2011-12, the steepest annual decline ever,
according to the researcher.  Spanish Prices  Domestic prices in Spain for extra-virgin olive oil rose 40
percent from June to about 2,400 euros ($3,073) a ton last week,
and could surpass the previous March 2008 high of 2,633 euros to
climb to at least 2,800 to 3,000 euros a ton, Oil World said.  “We consider it likely that olive oil prices have further
upward potential,” Oil World wrote. “The prospective decline
in Spanish production by approximately 650,000 tons can only be
partly offset by slightly higher crops in Italy and  Greece .”  Italy’s olive-oil production, the world’s second-largest,
is seen climbing to 540,000 tons from 518,000 tons, while output
in Greece may advance to 355,000 tons from 335,000 tons.  World consumption of olive oil is forecast to stagnate in
2012-13 after climbing for six consecutive years to 3.33 million
tons in the past season from 2.9 million tons in 2005-06,
according to Oil World.  “It can be expected that consumption of olive oil will be
affected by the prospective high prices and the widening of the
price premiums relative to sunflower oil and other vegetable
oils,” the researcher wrote.  World ending stocks of olive oil are forecast to drop to
747,000 tons, the lowest in three years, from an estimated 1.09
million tons at the end of September this year, Oil World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
