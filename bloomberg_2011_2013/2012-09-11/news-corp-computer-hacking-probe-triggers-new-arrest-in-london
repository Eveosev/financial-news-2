London police investigating
computer hacking and the use of stolen mobile phones by  News
Corp. (NWSA)  tabloid journalists arrested a 28-year-old man today.  The man, who wasn’t identified, was detained “by
appointment” after arriving for an interview at a south London
police station, the  Metropolitan Police Service  said today in a
statement. The man was later released on bail, it said.  Police investigating bribery of public officials by News
Corp.’s best-selling Sun tabloid in Britain arrested a 31-year-
old prison officer today on suspicion of corruption. Parallel
probes into phone hacking, computer hacking and bribery have led
to the arrests of more than 80 people since January 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
