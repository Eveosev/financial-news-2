Bank of New York Mellon Corp., 
ranked among the nation’s biggest securities lenders, said
traders may need as much as $4 trillion in extra collateral to
meet new rules set by derivatives exchanges.  The sum could range from $2 trillion to $4 trillion,
Timothy Keaney, vice chairman and chief executive officer of BNY
Mellon Asset Servicing, said today during a presentation hosted
by Barclays Plc. Investors will need the funds because new rules
designed to prevent another financial crisis require more
derivatives trades to go through a clearinghouse backed by
collateral in case a participant defaults.  At least seven banks including New York-based BNY Mellon
plan to let customers swap lower-rated securities that don’t
meet clearinghouse standards for a loan of Treasuries or similar
holdings that do qualify, a process dubbed “collateral
transformation.” BNY Mellon ranks second in  securities lending 
and expects to gain business from the new rules, Keaney said.  “It’s a combination of the huge spike in volume that will
have to be collateralized, and helping clients that don’t have
the right collateral get the right collateral to post on behalf
of their trading activities,” he said. “We think we’re
starting from a great position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
