Egypt  ordered the arrest of former
Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, who was a presidential candidate,
and referred him to criminal court, the Justice Ministry said.  Judge Osama el-Saiedy referred Shafik, along with Alaa and
 Gamal Mubarak , the two sons of ousted President  Hosni Mubarak ,
and three former officials at the Aviation Ministry to the
criminal court on charges of profiteering, facilitating the
seizure of public funds and forging official documents to
expedite the sale of land in Ismailia governorate, the Justice
Ministry said today in a faxed statement from Cairo.  President Mohamed Mursi and the Muslim Brotherhood had cast
Shafik, who was Mubarak’s last prime minister, as a candidate
aiming to revive the ousted leader’s government. Shafik lost to
Mursi after a race that polarized Egyptians.  General Prosecutor Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud asked Interpol to
arrest Shafik, his office said in a faxed statement today.
Shafik, a career air force officer and former civil aviation
minister, is now in the  United Arab Emirates .  He was among several officials, including Mubarak, named in
lawsuits alleging land usurpation that benefited an air force
pilots’ association, Mahmoud’s office said on June 26. Youssef Wali, a former agriculture minister, was also named in the
claims referred to the judge, the prosecutor said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
