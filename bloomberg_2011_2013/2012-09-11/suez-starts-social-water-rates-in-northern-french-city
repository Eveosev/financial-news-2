Suez Environnement (SEV) , the second-
biggest waste and water utility, will begin charging residents
of the northern French city of Dunkirk variable water rates that
depend on income, size of household and usage.  Starting next month, residents’ water rates will be based
on how much they consume as well as financial resources, the
Paris-based company said today in a statement. One of President
 Francois Hollande ’s campaign promises was so-called social
tariffs to make water, natural gas and power more affordable.  An official at the utility said details about the rates
would be provided Sept. 21 when the system is inaugurated with
the municipality. Under the contract, Suez provides water to
about 220,000 households in 27 municipalities around Dunkirk.  French water contracts are being signed at lower rates,
Suez Environnement and larger rival  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  have
said. Hollande, elected in May, promised to make water and other
utilities less costly for low-income families. The government
has unveiled draft legislation on power and natural gas rates,
and said water will come later.  In Dunkirk, water rates will be lowest for initial volumes
deemed “essential,” then rise for what the company called
“useful” water and still higher for even greater volumes that
some households may use, according to today’s statement.  The rates will then be further adjusted depending on
 household income  and the number of occupants in a household,
Suez Environnement said. This is the utility’s first such
contract that includes this measure, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
