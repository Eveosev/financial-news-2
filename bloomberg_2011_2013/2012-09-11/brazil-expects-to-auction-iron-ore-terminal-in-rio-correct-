(Corrects to say short term in second paragraph after Rio’s
 Port Authority  corrected spelling mistake in statement.)  Brazil  expects to hold an auction
for a dry-bulk port terminal in the Rio de Janeiro state this
year after the lease received initial approval by Brazil’s
National Accounts Tribunal, Rio’s Port Authority said.  Bidding rules for the auction of the so-called Area do Meio
terminal in Rio’s Port of Itaguai will be published in the
“short term,” the port authority known as Cia. Docas do Rio de
Janeiro said in an e-mailed statement today.  The winner of the auction is expected to be announced this
year, a Docas press official said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
