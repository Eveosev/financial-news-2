Russia harvested 7.6 million metric
tons of sugar beets from about 19 percent of the area sown with
the roots, the Sugar Producers’ Union  said .  Harvesting continues in the Central, Southern, North
Caucasus and Volga federal districts, the group said on its
website today. Yields reached 35.3 tons a hectare (2.47 acres),
it said, without giving a year-earlier comparison.  Last year’s crop rose to a record 46.2 million tons,
enabling the country to produce 5.1 million tons of sugar from
domestic beets in the 2011-12 season, an all-time high,
according to government statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
