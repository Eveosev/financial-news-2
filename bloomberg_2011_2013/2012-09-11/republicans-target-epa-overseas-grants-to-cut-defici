U.S.  House Republicans  proposed
blocking Environmental Protection Agency grants made for
international research as a way to trim the federal deficit.  The EPA awards, which topped $21 million last year,
included projects to train Polish municipalities on landfill
gas, a study of swine manure in  China  and promotion of a
“Breathe Easy Jakarta” program on indoor-air quality in
 Indonesia . The  deficit  will be $1.1 trillion this year, the
 Congressional Budget Office  has estimated.  “These projects may be perfectly fine, but when we have
this kind of debt, we need to curtail them,” Representative Ed Whitfield of  Kentucky , the Republican chairman of the
subcommittee on Energy and Power of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, said today at a hearing. Whitfield pushed
legislation at the meeting to prohibit the international grants.  The EPA said that its spending on projects outside the U.S.
accounted for less than 1 percent of the agency’s grant budget
in the past four years, and that these types of programs date
back to 1972.  “While the EPA’s investment in international grants is
comparatively small, these grants play an important role in
protecting the health and environment of American citizens,”
Craig Hooks, an assistant EPA administrator, said in prepared
testimony. The legislation “will cripple the agency’s ability
through grants to address harmful air pollutants that affect
both the global and domestic environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
