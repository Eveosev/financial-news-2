Starwood Capital Group LLC, the
real estate investment firm led by Barry Sternlicht, is
considering the sale of a minority stake in the company,
according to a person with knowledge of the situation.  The Greenwich, Connecticut-based company, which manages
assets of almost $20 billion, hired  Morgan Stanley (MS)  as an
adviser, said the person, who asked not to be named because the
information is private.  Tom Johnson , a spokesman for Starwood Capital, and Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to comment.  Starwood would join other private investment firms that
have sold stakes to cash out founders or set a value for the
company before going public.  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , before its
initial public offering in May, had sold stakes to Abu Dhabi’s
Mubadala Development Co. and the California Public Employees’
Retirement System. Blackstone Group LP, as part of its 2007 IPO,
sold a minority nonvoting stake to China Investment Corp.  Sternlicht was chairman and CEO of Starwood Hotels &
Resorts Worldwide Inc., a company he founded, from 1995 to 2005.
In 1991, he created  Starwood Capital , a firm whose investments
have included the Carlyle Hotel in New York and the Paramount
Bay residential tower in Miami, according to the company’s
website.  Starwood’s exploration of a stake sale was reported earlier
today by the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
