OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, snapped the longest streak of gains in eight months on
concern the country will struggle to obtain a bailout and that
global policy makers won’t do enough to spur economic growth.  The shares fell 0.5 percent to 3,900 forint by 1:37 p.m. in
Budapest. The stock rose 11 percent in the previous seven
trading sessions, lifting its 14-day  relative strength index  to
above the 70 level that indicates to some analysts a security is
overbought. The RSI was at 68 today.  Emerging-market stocks fell on concern China’s economic
slowdown is deepening and Europe will struggle to contain its
debt crisis. Investors are also waiting to see if the  Federal
Reserve  takes steps to boost the  U.S. economy  at a meeting this
week. Hungary’s aid talks may resume in October, a month later
than earlier expected,  Mihaly Varga , the country’s chief aid
negotiator, said in Warsaw today.  “The Federal Reserve meeting is much awaited but another
round of quantitative easing cannot be taken for granted,”
Peter Varju, a Budapest-based trader at Erste Group Bank AG,
said by telephone. “There is still uncertainty about Hungary’s
IMF deal and OTP is strongly affected by both types of issues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
