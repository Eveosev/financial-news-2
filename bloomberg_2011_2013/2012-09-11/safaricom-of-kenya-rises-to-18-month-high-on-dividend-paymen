Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) ,  East Africa ’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, advanced to its highest in more
than 18 months ahead of book closure for a dividend payment.  The stock climbed 4.9 percent to close at 4.25 shillings,
the strongest level since Feb. 22, 2011, in Nairobi, the
capital.  Safaricom raised its dividend by 10 percent to 0.22
shillings, the company said on May 10. Book closure for the
dividend is on Sept. 13.  “The recent development in mobile termination rate which
will not be implemented as earlier planned has also boosted the
stocks,” Eric Musau , a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  President Mwai Kibaki issued a directive to the industry
regulator, the Communication Commission of  Kenya , not to change
the mobile termination rate until a fresh study of the same is
carried out, Business Daily reported on  Aug 28 . Kenya mobile
operators had on May 29 struck a deal that was to see the MTR
fall to 1.60 shilling per minute on July 1 from the current 2.21
shillings. MTR is the fee mobile operators pay one another for
handling calls originating from a rival network.  African Alliance securities raised its price estimate on
Safaricom stock to 3.75 shillings from 3.15 shillings, it said
Aug. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
