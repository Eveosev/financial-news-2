Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) ’s plan to
build Europe’s largest casino complex in  Madrid  would boost
tourist spending there by 15 billion euros ($19.2 billion) per
year, according to the agency in talks to secure the deal.  “It will change the dimension of our economy,” Jesus
Sainz, chairman of Promomadrid, said in an interview in the
Spanish capital on Sept. 10. “It will have an impact on our
gross domestic product of between four and five points.”  Las Vegas Sands, the Nevada-based casino company controlled
by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , said last week it chose Madrid
as the location for the project. Should it be built, the complex
may help  Spain  emerge from the second recession since 2009,
which has pushed the  unemployment rate  to 25 percent and more
than 50 percent among young people.  Sands, which has said it will contribute about 25 percent
to 35 percent of the equity for the project, has yet to select a
specific destination out of three possible sites for the planned
resort and secure financing for the project. Once funding is in
place, construction on the development could begin within 12 to
15 months, Sainz said.  Madrid beat  Barcelona , Spain’s second-largest city, in a
bid to secure the investment, which could reach as much as 18
billion euros to build 12 resorts with 36,000 hotel rooms in
three phases over a 10-year period, according to Sainz.  Airport Links  “They chose Madrid because its Barajas airport has
connections with almost 250 cities worldwide and excellent
infrastructure links within the capital and to the rest of
Spain,” Sainz said.  If all three phases of the complex, which would include
six casinos with more than 1,000 gambling tables, 18,000  slot
machines , nine theaters and three golf courses, are completed,
it would double the number of tourists visiting the region to
20 million per year, and increase tourism spending by 100
percent, according to Sainz.  Promomadrid estimates that the project would create 164,000
jobs directly and a further 97,000 jobs indirectly, equal to
about half the number of unemployed in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
