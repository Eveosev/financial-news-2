Oil traded near the highest level
in three weeks amid speculation China and the U.S. will add
stimulus to their economies, sustaining demand for fuel in the
world’s biggest crude-consuming nations.  Futures were little changed after rising for a fifth day
yesterday, the longest run of gains since July. Chinese Premier
 Wen Jiabao  said the government has more room for fiscal and
monetary policy to support growth. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  starts a two-day meeting today, where it may announce
measures to stimulate the  U.S. economy . The country’s crude
stockpiles  probably fell  2.9 million barrels last week,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts before an
Energy Department report.  “The premier’s comments are supportive for the oil
market,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC
Markets in Sydney. “With the Fed, the issue is what they do and
how big it’s going to be. Without supply shocks, we are probably
fairly close to the top end of the range for oil.”  Crude for October delivery was at $97.39 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , up 22
cents, at 3:09 p.m. Singapore time. The contract yesterday rose
0.7 percent to $97.17, the highest close since Aug. 22. Prices
are 1.5 percent lower this year.  Brent oil for October settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange climbed 45 cents to $115.85 a barrel.
The European benchmark crude was at a premium of $18.47 to New
York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade, from $18.23
yesterday.  ‘Ample Strength’  The price difference between the world’s two most-traded
varieties of crude, which widened to $21.92 a barrel last month,
is narrowing as North Sea production rebounds from the lowest in
five years. Daily exports of the four crude grades comprising
the Dated Brent benchmark will increase 24 percent in October,
the most in two years, as maintenance work ends, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows.  China  has “ample strength” for preemptive fiscal and
monetary measures, Wen said at the  World Economic Forum  in
Tianjin yesterday. The government is trying to prevent growth
this year from slipping below the 7.5 percent target set in
March, which would already be the weakest since 1990.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Aug. 31 that he
wouldn’t rule out more economic stimulus for the U.S. The
central bank bought a total of $2.3 trillion in bonds from
December 2008 to June 2011 in two rounds of asset purchases
known as quantitative easing.  “The market is waiting on the outcome of the FOMC meeting
and data from the Energy Department,” said  David Lennox , an
analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney.  Supplies ‘Abundant’  Oil in  New York  dropped as much as 0.5 percent today after
the industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  said crude
stockpiles rose 221,000 barrels last week. Gasoline inventories
declined 4.16 million barrels last week to 197.7 million, the
lowest since October 2008, and distillate-fuel inventories were
up 2.55 million, the API report showed.  Oil supplies are abundant and consumption will slow next
year, according to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Global demand will climb by an average 800,000
barrels a day to 89.55 million a day in 2013, OPEC said in its
monthly report yesterday. Demand is forecast to increase 900,000
barrels a day to 88.74 million this year. The group estimates
its 12 members will need to pump an average of 29.5 million
barrels a day next year, or 1.9 million less than current
output.  West Texas crude will average $93.67 a barrel in the final
three months of this year, the Energy Department said in its
Short-Term Energy Outlook yesterday. Prices will average $92.63
next year, it predicted.  Oil in New York has technical resistance along the upper
Bollinger Band on the daily chart, around $99.37 a barrel today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures have halted
advances near this indicator since July. Sell orders tend to be
clustered near chart-resistance levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
