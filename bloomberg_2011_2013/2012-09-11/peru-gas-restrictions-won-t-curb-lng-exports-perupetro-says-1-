Peru’s Camisea Group, led by  Hunt
Oil Co.  and Pluspetrol SA, can keep exporting liquefied natural
gas at current rates even after the government restricted one of
the Camisea field’s two blocks to domestic industry, according
to the country’s state oil contracting agency.  “Exports will continue as long as the country doesn’t
require more gas for local industry,” Perupetro President Rosa
Ortiz said today at a press conference in  Lima . “This is a
country that respects contracts.”  Peru will also seek bids at the end of November for 36 oil
and natural-gas exploration areas in the Amazon jungle,
highlands and Pacific coast, Ortiz said.  Peru had planned to halve its 450 million cubic feet daily
gas shipments to  Mexico  after allocating reserves from Camisea’s
Block 88 to supply domestic industry. LNG exports from Block 56
are “normal” and talks with the government continue, Hunt Oil
country manager Barbara Bruce said Sept. 5.  The government won’t negotiate with companies including
Pluspetrol,  Maple Energy Plc (MPLE)  and  Interoil Exploration and
Production ASA (IOX)  for their expiring oil and gas blocks, which will
be put up for bids, Ortiz said. State oil company Petroperu SA
will take a minimum 25 percent stake in both the expiring
contracts and the 36 new blocks, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
