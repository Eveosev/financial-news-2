Cyprus’s fiscal deficit on a cash
basis for the period January to June narrowed to about 3 percent
of gross domestic product from 3.6 percent the year before, the
 Finance Ministry  said.  Revenue rose 1.3 percent to 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion)
from the same period a year ago, while expenditure fell 1.4
percent to 3.5 billion euros, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. The primary deficit, which doesn’t include
debt-interest payments, fell to 212.2 million euros from 349.9
million euros the year before.  Cyprus, the euro area’s third smallest economy, which in
June became the fifth member of the 17-country currency bloc to
request a European rescue, intends cutting the fiscal deficit to
2.5 percent of GDP this year from 6.3 percent in 2011, Vassos Shiarly, the finance minister, said on April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
