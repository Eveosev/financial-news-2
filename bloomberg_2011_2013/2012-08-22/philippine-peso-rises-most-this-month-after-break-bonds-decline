The Philippine peso climbed the most
this month after Germany signaled it may consider relaxing
conditions on aid to Greece, boosting demand for emerging-market
assets.  The currency rebounded from its worst week since May as
central bank data showed Philippine balance of payments surplus
surged to $3.18 billion last month from $14 million in June.
Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, whose government favors an
extension of its fiscal adjustment program by two years, travels
to Berlin and Paris on Aug. 24 and 25. Financial markets in the
Philippines were shut on Aug. 20 and Aug. 21 for Eid holidays.  “So far news from Europe is supportive of Asian currencies
such as the peso,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief market
strategist at Manila-based  BDO Unibank Inc. (BDO)  “Demand for the
peso is also stronger today because of the bunching up of
overseas remittances following the two-day holiday.”  The peso climbed 0.3 percent to 42.29 per dollar as of 4:37
p.m in Manila, Tullett Prebon Plc prices showed. That’s the
biggest gain since July 31. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
little changed at 6.30 percent.  Bonds declined with the yield on the 7.375 percent debt due
March 2021 rising five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 5 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
