Andy Haldane,  executive director  for
financial stability at the  Bank of England , said investors’
increasing preference for short-term results is costing them
returns and hindering the recovery, according to an article in
Prospect magazine.  Future cash flows are getting too heavily discounted, with
average returns one year ahead reduced by about 5 percent to 10
percent “too much,” Haldane wrote in the September issue of
the magazine, citing a study he conducted with Richard Davies. A
survey of 400 chief financial officers that showed more than
three quarters would reject projects enhancing long-term value
to meet earnings numbers illustrates that “quarterly capitalism
is seriously inhibiting long-term investment.”  Policies to counter this outlook should create financial
incentives to reward a long-term view, Haldane said. These may
include loyalty bonuses to shareholders and employees based on
length of tenure, or capital-gains rates on project cash flows
that taper off according to the length of the holding period.  “There is compelling evidence that short-termism is
slowing investment today and so growth tomorrow,” he said. “In
the current environment, that is something we can ill afford.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
