Kakuzi Ltd. (KKZI) , a Kenyan agricultural
company, dropped the most in almost a month after announcing
plans to sell its 50.5 percent shareholding in Siret Tea Co.  Shares retreated 0.7 percent to 75 shillings by 1:15 p.m.
in Nairobi, the biggest decline since July 27.  Kakuzi will sell the stake to Siret Outgrowers Empowerment
and Produce Co., a group of smallholder farmers, for an
undisclosed amount. The transaction is expected to be completed
on Aug. 31, the company said in a statement published in the
Daily Nation newspaper.  “What we are seeing is a knee-jerk reaction from minority
shareholders who are concerned about the transparency around the
sale price,”  Aly-Khan Satchu , chief executive officer of
Nairobi-based investment company Rich Management Ltd., said in a
phone interview today.  Minority shareholders could be concerned that Kakuzi may
not have got a competitive price for the holding, Satchu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
