Gold rose to a 16-week high on signs
that Federal Reserve policy makers may expand monetary stimulus
to bolster the  U.S. economy , boosting demand for the metal as an
inflation hedge.  “Many members judged that additional monetary
accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless
incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable
strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery,” according
to the record of the Federal Open Market Committee’s July 31-
Aug. 1 gathering released today.  “Gold is surging on renewed expectations of inflation
rising after easing,” Michael Gayed, the chief investment
strategist at New York-based Pension Partners LLC, which advises
on more than $150 million in assets, said in a telephone
interview.  After the Fed announcement at 2 p.m.  New York  time, gold
futures for December delivery reached $1,655.90 an ounce on the
Comex, the highest for a most-active contract since May 2. The
price gained 0.7 percent to $1,654.70 an ounce in electronic
trading at 2:54 p.m.  Earlier, the metal settled 0.1 percent lower at $1,640.50.  Gold surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may address monetary options
at a conference in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , at the end of August.  In 2010 at the Kansas City Fed’s annual monetary symposium
in Jackson Hole, Bernanke foreshadowed a $600 billion bond-
purchase program.  To contact the reporter for this story:
