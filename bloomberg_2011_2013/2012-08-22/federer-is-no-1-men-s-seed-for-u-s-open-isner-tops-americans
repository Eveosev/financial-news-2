Five-time winner  Roger Federer  of
Switzerland is the top men’s seed for the U.S. Open ahead of
defending champion Novak Djokovic of Serbia.  Federer moved past Djokovic and regained the No. 1 spot in
the ATP World Tour Rankings by defeating Britain’s  Andy Murray 
in the July 8 Wimbledon final. The U.S. Tennis Association
followed the world rankings in assigning the 32 men’s seeds.  Murray, who beat Federer in the London Olympics gold-medal
match Aug. 5, is seeded No. 3, followed by  David Ferrer . Fellow
Spaniard  Rafael Nadal , who is ranked third in the world, pulled
out of the U.S. Open last week because of injuries.  Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France is seeded fifth, followed by
Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic, 2009 champion Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina, Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia and  John Isner , who at No. 9 is the highest-seeded American man this
year.  Juan Monaco  of Argentina is the 10th seed.  Federer, 31, who won the U.S. Open title every year from
2004 to 2008, is 56-7 this year with six tournament titles.  The U.S. Open, the last of the year’s four major tennis
tournaments, begins Aug. 27 in New York.  The seeds for the women’s singles draw, which has been
weakened by the withdrawal this week of three players ranked in
the top 20, are yet to be announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
