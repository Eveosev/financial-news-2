Sales of asset-backed bonds are
falling in Europe as issuers take advantage of cheap central
bank funding, according to  Standard & Poor’s .  Banks sold 44 billion euros ($55 billion) of bonds backed
by mortgages, auto loans and credit-card payments in the first
seven months of the year, about 10 percent lower than for the
same period of 2011, S&P said, citing data from JPMorgan Chase &
Co. Almost 50 percent of the notes sold were backed by prime
U.K. home loans.  Volumes of ABS plunged about 80 percent in the five years
since the financial crisis started, after previously fueling
economic growth by allowing lenders to refinance the cheap
credit they extended. The  European Central Bank  has provided
lenders with 1 trillion euros of low-cost financing in the past
year.  “Securitization issuance volumes remain under pressure in
 Europe , a victim of banks’ ongoing efforts to shrink their
balance sheets, large central bank funding programs, and
regulatory uncertainty,” S&P analyst Mark Boyce wrote in a
report.  Regulatory changes will shape future demand for ABS bonds,
S&P said, with treatment of securitized assets yet to be
finalized in the Basel III and Solvency II directives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
