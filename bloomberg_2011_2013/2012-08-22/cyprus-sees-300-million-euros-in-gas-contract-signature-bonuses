Cyprus plans to collect as much as
300 million euros ($374 million) in signature bonuses from
energy companies that have bid to explore for natural gas off
the Mediterranean island’s south coast.  Neoklis Sylikiotis , the Cypriot minister for commerce,
industry and tourism, said negotiations with the 15 companies
that applied for licenses to explore nine offshore blocks may
begin as soon as October and last as long as 10 months.  Australia ’s  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  and Petroliam Nasional
Bhd of  Malaysia  were among the companies that expressed interest
after U.S. producer  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  said in December that it
had found as much as 8 trillion cubic feet of gas off Cyprus,
the country’s first such discovery.  Sylikiotis said Noble will conduct a second round of
exploratory drilling early next year and will begin to produce
gas by 2017 to supply the Cypriot market. The Houston-based
company could start to export gas by 2019, after Cyprus
completes a planned liquefaction terminal, he said in an
interview.  “The state has to play a leading role in the liquefaction
plant,” Sylikiotis said. “The government must be able to
direct the management of the terminal by holding a large stake”
in the venture, though not necessarily a controlling stake. The
government seeks to attract interest in the plant from gas
buyers as well as producers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
