Egypt’s president and top economic
officials will meet today with the head of the  International
Monetary Fund , potentially moving closer to a $4.8 billion loan
for an economy battered by last year’s uprising.  Christine Lagarde , the IMF’s managing director, is slated
to meet with President Mohamed Mursi and Prime Minister Hisham Qandil to discuss the framework for the loan. The funding was
requested more than a year ago and approval was stalled amid
political infighting as the IMF requested broad consensus on an
economic program.  Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed told the state-run al-
Ahram newspaper that devaluing the Egyptian pound was not under
discussion and that the IMF wasn’t imposing conditions on the
loan. He separately told the financial daily al-Borsa that Egypt
would withdraw the funds in a lump sum, using the money to
finance a  budget deficit  and boost foreign currency reserves.  Egypt ’s international reserves have declined by around 60
percent since the start of 2011, to $14.4 billion by the end of
July, according to central bank figures. The pound is projected
to drop 5.3% to 6.41 per dollar by the end of the year,
according to the average of five analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Egyptian officials, including el-Saieed, have said the IMF
funds will encourage other funding for Egypt, which has seen its
borrowing costs surge by 50 percent since the start of last
year’s uprising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
