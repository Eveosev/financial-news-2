Frankel , the world’s top-ranked
horse, extended his perfect record to 13 straight wins by taking
the Juddmonte International Stakes.  Frankel, ridden by jockey Tom Queally and trained by Henry
Cecil, won by seven lengths in the 1-mile, 2-furlong race at
York Racecourse in northern  England . Farhh, with jockey Frankie Dettori, beat St Nicholas Abbey, ridden by Joseph O’Brien, by a
nose for second place.  “We had our plan in place and it all worked out so
nicely,” Queally told broadcaster Channel 4.  It was the first time Frankel, a 4-year-old bay colt owned
by Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah, had run a distance of more than
a mile. Among his victories are last year’s 2,000 Guineas in
Newmarket, which he won by six lengths, and the Sussex Stakes at
Goodwood on Aug. 1.  Frankel was the 1-10 favorite, meaning a successful $10 bet
returned $1 plus the original stake. St Nicholas Abbey was
second favorite at 5-1.  Rated the best racehorse in the world by the British
Horseracing Authority, Frankel’s victory at York earned his
owner 411,147 pounds ($649,447).  To contact the reporter on this story:
