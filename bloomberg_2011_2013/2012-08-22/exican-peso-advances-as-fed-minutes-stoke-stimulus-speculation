Mexico’s peso rose the most in two
weeks as speculation the  Federal Reserve  may act soon to shore
up U.S. economic growth boosted the outlook for Latin America’s
second-biggest economy.  The peso appreciated 0.5 percent to 13.0739 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, extending its rally this year to 6.6
percent, the biggest among the 16 most-traded counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg. The currency earlier touched 13.2177, the
weakest intraday level since Aug. 17.  The peso reversed losses after minutes from the Fed’s last
policy meeting showed many policy makers favored more monetary
easing. Mexico depends on exports for about 30 percent of its
gross domestic product, and sends 80 percent of them to its
northern neighbor.  The peso “is reacting favorably to the minutes in that
there could be another round of monetary stimulus,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , said by phone from
Mexico City. “It would help the  U.S. economy  and therefore
would be good news for Mexico.”  Mexico’s economy may expand 3.7 percent this year after
growing 3.9 percent last year, compared with a 2.2 percent
projection for the U.S., according to the median estimates of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Many members judged that additional monetary
accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless
incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable
strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery,” according
to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s July 31-
Aug. 1 meeting, released today in  Washington .  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.57 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.53
centavo to 139.44 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
