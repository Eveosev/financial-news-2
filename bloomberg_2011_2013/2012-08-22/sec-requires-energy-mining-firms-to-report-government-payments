U.S.-listed energy and mining
companies must report what they pay each country in which they
tap resources in a rule adopted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  SEC commissioners voted 2-1 today to compel public
disclosure of taxes, royalties and fees paid to any government -
- including the U.S. -- by so-called extractive industries
companies for access to resources. SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro ,
who formerly served on the boards of  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  and
Cinergy Corp., and Republican Commissioner Troy Paredes recused
themselves from voting on the final rule.  The initial disclosures must be filed for fiscal years
ending after Sept. 30, 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
