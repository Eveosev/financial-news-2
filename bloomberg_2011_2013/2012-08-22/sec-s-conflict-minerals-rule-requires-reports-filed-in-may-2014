U.S. manufacturers and companies
that contract with them must file reports starting in May 2014
identifying where they obtained any of four minerals associated
with human-rights abuses in central  Africa , according to a
Securities and Exchange Commission rule.  SEC commissioners voted 3-2 today to adopt a so-called
conflict minerals rule requiring companies to make reasonable
efforts to trace sources of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold in
their products and a deeper search if the metals may have come
from mines that have helped fund armed groups in the  Democratic
Republic  of Congo. Metals certified as scrap or recycled would
automatically be considered conflict-free under the SEC rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
