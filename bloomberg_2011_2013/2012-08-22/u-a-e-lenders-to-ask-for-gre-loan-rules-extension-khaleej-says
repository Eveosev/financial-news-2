The United Arab Emirates banking
association will ask the central bank to extend by six months
the deadline for banks to comply with rules curtailing exposure
to government-linked companies, Al-Khaleej reported.  The  Emirates Banks Association  has prepared a report
stating that the exposure of many lenders is higher than the
limit ordered by the central bank, the newspaper reported,
citing the EBA study.  Banks in the U.A.E. can lend no more than 100 percent of
their capital to local governments and the same to government-
related entities known as GREs, the central bank said April 4.
There was no limit under previous rules. Banks have until Sept.
30 to comply with the rules, the central bank said at the time.  The regulator may extend the deadline for some banks to
comply with the rules, Al-Khaleej reported May 30, citing
Chairman Khalil Foulathi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
