Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
said he “guarantees personally” that rescue funds for his
country will be paid back,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing
an interview.  “I can assure you, we will deliver,” Samaras told the
German newspaper before his visit to Berlin for talks with
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  this week. He said a Greek exit from
the euro would be “catastrophic” and would lead to social
unrest that would affect  Europe  more broadly.  Samaras also signaled that his country needs more time to
meet targets agreed with its bailout partners, telling
Sueddeutsche that “some things might have to change” to
support  Greece ’s reform efforts.  He said comments by other politicians on a Greek exit have
disrupted efforts by his government to sell state holdings.  “Every time a German, Dutch or Austrian politician brings
a euro exit into the debate, I think, ‘how should I privatize
state operations? Which businesses will invest euros with us,
when they might be paid back in drachma?’”  Samaras said his government will look at exceeding its
current privatization plans, including the state rail system and
state-held betting vendors, Sueddeutsche reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
