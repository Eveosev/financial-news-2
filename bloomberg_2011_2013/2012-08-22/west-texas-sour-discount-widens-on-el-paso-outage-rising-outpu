West  Texas  Sour oil weakened to the
cheapest versus benchmark West Texas Intermediate in almost
seven weeks because of decreased demand during refinery
maintenance and growing production.  Work on a shut crude unit and reformer at  Western Refining
Inc. (WNR) ’s El Paso, Texas, refinery is expected to last about two
weeks or less,  Gary Hanson , a company spokesman, said yesterday.
Eagle Ford production of oil and condensate has grown to average
between 550,000 and 600,000 barrels a day, Phani Gadde, a senior
analyst with  Wood Mackenzie , a research and consulting firm in
Houston, said in a telephone interview.  West Texas Sour’s discount to WTI widened 20 cents to $4 a
barrel at 4:05 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the widest margin since July 6.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened $1.30 to
$17.70. Heavy Louisiana Sweet rose 55 cents to $16.85 over WTI.  Poseidon’s  premium  increased 10 cents to $12.50. Mars Blend
lost 20 cents to $12.30 a barrel over WTI. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium widened by 65 cents to $11.90.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, slipped by 30 cents to
a premium of $15.  Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $8 above WTI. Bakken
oil from  North Dakota  was steady at a $1 discount to WTI.  Western Canada Select’s discount was unchanged at $11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
