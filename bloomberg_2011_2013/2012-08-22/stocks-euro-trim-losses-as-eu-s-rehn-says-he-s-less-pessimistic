U.S. stocks pared losses and the
euro erased declines as European Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said he is less pessimistic on the euro
outlook than he was in the spring. Treasuries remained higher.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down less than 0.1
percent at 1,412.06 at 9:55 a.m. in  New York  after slipping as
much as 0.3 percent. The euro was little changed at $1.2471,
reversing a drop of 0.3 percent. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields
fell five basis points to 1.75 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
