First lady  Michelle Obama  said an
initiative with more than 2,000 companies has helped 125,000
military veterans and spouses find jobs, beating a goal of
100,000 hires set a year ago.  Obama, who spoke today at Naval Station Mayport in the
election battleground state of  Florida , set a new goal of hiring
an additional 250,000 jobless veterans and spouses by the end of
2014.  The White House Joining Forces Program, headed by the first
lady and  Jill Biden , the vice president’s wife, began an effort
a year ago to help private companies hire jobless veterans.
Companies such as  Bank of America Corp. , Xerox Corp.,  General
Electric Co. (GE) , JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) 
agreed to step up their hiring of veterans.  “As of today, they have hired or trained 125,000 veterans
and military spouses -- 125,000,” Obama said. “And they’ve
done it more than a year ahead of schedule. That’s pretty
impressive.”  The 125,000 hires include 97,000 veterans and 28,000
spouses, according to Semonti Stephens, an Obama spokeswoman.  The number of jobless veterans has declined by 23 percent
over the last year to 752,000 in July, down from 975,000 a year
earlier, according to the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .  The jobless rate among veterans fell to 6.9 percent last
month, down from 8.6 percent in July 2011 and less than the 8.3
percent national  unemployment rate .  The improvement masks persistent high unemployment among
younger veterans who have served since 2001, many of them in the
wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan . While their jobless rate is down
from 12.4 percent a year ago, it was 8.9 percent last month.  ‘Far From Finished’  Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based
veterans support group, said more efforts like the first lady’s
initiative are needed.  “America’s work on this urgent issue is far from
finished,” Paul Rieckhoff, the group’s founder and executive
director, said in a statement. “Over the next few years, more
than a million veterans will leave the military in an uncertain
economy, and we need a deep commitment from the public and
private sectors to prepare for the surge.”  A parallel effort to hire veterans by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, which has held hundreds of job fairs, has found work
for 10,400 veterans and spouses, with a goal of hiring 500,000
veterans and spouses by the end of 2014, said Bryan Goettel, a
spokesman for the chamber’s Hiring Our Heroes program.  “We’re just getting started,” Obama said. “And we’re not
going to stop until all of our veterans know that when they hit
that job market, their skills will be rewarded.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
