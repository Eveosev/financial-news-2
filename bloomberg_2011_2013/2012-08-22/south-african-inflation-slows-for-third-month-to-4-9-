South African inflation slowed more
than economists expected in July, reviving speculation policy
makers will cut  interest rates  for a second time this year to
spur the economy.  The  inflation rate  fell to a 14-month low of 4.9 percent
from 5.5 percent in June, Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa 
said on its website today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 18 economists was 5.2 percent. Prices rose 0.3 percent
in the month.  “It has opened up the chance for a September cut,” Peter Attard Montalto, an economist at Nomura International Plc. in
 London , said in a telephone interview today. “There is more
disinflation to come from here.”  The  Reserve Bank  cut its benchmark repurchase rate by half
a percentage point to 5 percent last month, the first adjustment
in 20 months, to help support growth in  Africa ’s biggest
economy. Governor Gill Marcus said on July 29 further reductions
are not automatic and should not be taken for granted, tempering
expectations of another cut.  Today’s data has rekindled that speculation. The yield on
the forward-rate agreement due in four months dropped 5 basis
points to 4.88 percent after the data was published, indicating
that traders are beginning to price in the chance of a cut in
that period. The Monetary Policy Committee is set to make its
next rate decision on Sept. 20.  Slower Growth  The rand gained to 8.2810 against the dollar as of 10:52
a.m. in Johannesburg from 8.2983 before the data was released.
The yield on the benchmark bond due in 2015 dropped 3 basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.54 percent.  Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  has said the economy will
probably expand at a slower pace than the 2.7 percent forecast
by the government in February as the debt crisis in  Europe 
persists.  Growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 15
percent of the economy, slowed to 0.8 percent in June, while
business confidence declined to the lowest level in 12 years
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
