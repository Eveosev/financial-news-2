Pork stockpiles in the U.S.
climbed 20 percent at the end of July from a year earlier,
the government said, amid increased production and slowing
demand.  Warehouses held 546.6 million pounds, or 247.9 million
metric tons of pork, a record for the month, up from  454.3
million  on July 31, 2011, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories fell 7.8
percent from the end of June.  Commercial pork output in the first six months of the
year was 11.4 billion pounds, up 2.6 percent from the same
period a year earlier, government  data  show. Output
probably rose last month from July 2011 as processors
slaughtered more animals and at heavier weights, said  Bob Brown , an independent market consultant in Edmond,
 Oklahoma . Wholesale- pork  prices fell 3.7 percent in July,
the biggest monthly drop since March.  “We did have some concerns about demand,”  Rich Nelson , the chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview before the report.
“During July, we did have more production.”  Hogs sold for immediate delivery to pork processors
plunged 8.2 percent in July, the biggest monthly drop since
August 2011. Hog futures for October settlement fell 3.5
percent to 73.2 cents a pound at 12:56 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.  As of July 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are
cured and sliced to make bacon, fell 5.1 percent from a
year earlier to 28 million pounds, according to today’s
report. Warehouse supplies of ham rose 15 percent from a
year ago to 154.6 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of July were 14
percent smaller than a year earlier at 648.6 million
pounds, the USDA said. Beef supplies rose 9.8 percent to
455.7 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
