European Parliament lawmakers are
seeking views on how to prevent any repeat of the scandal
engulfing interbank lending rates and on whether manipulation of
the benchmarks was more widespread than reported.  The assembly’s economic and monetary affairs committee is
probing what steps should be taken to stamp out “manipulation
and establish integrity” in market indexes such as Libor and
Euribor, the parliament said in a statement  published  on its
website. The committee will hold a hearing on the abuse of
interbank lending rates on Sept. 24.  The parliament is seeking views on “specific measures”
that “should be taken at European/global level to improve
investor confidence,” it said. The consultations will run until
Sept. 17.  Confidence in Libor, the benchmark  interest rate  for more
than $500 trillion of securities, has been shaken by  Barclays
Plc (BARC) ’s admission that it submitted false rates. The revelations
have provoked renewed calls for tougher oversight of the
financial system and pushed regulatory probes of interbank
lending rates to the top of the political agenda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
