 A military judge canceled
preliminary hearings scheduled to start tomorrow for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, because of a hurricane threat.  Citing “a concern for the safety and welfare of all
personnel,” Army Colonel James Pohl canceled the hearings for
Mohammed and four other accused terrorists scheduled for this
week and early next week at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba. A new hearing date has not yet been set, according to the
judge’s order.  The U.S. National Hurricane Center’s tracking map shows
Tropical Storm Isaac crossing  Haiti  as a hurricane on Aug. 24
and striking Cuba before arriving at the Florida coast below
Cape Coral on Aug. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
