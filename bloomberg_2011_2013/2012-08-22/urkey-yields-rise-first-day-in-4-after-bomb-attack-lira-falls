Turkey ’s  bond yields  rose for the
first time in four days and the lira weakened on concern of an
escalation in conflict with neighboring  Syria  after a bomb
attack killed nine in the southern city of Gaziantep.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt climbed eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.81 percent by 1:39 p.m.
in Istanbul, heading for the biggest gain in more than a week.
The lira weakened less than 0.1 percent to 1.7948 per dollar,
falling from the highest level since Aug. 10.  The bombing on the second day of a three-day religious
holiday came after several clashes in the southeast between the
army and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party or PKK. The group, which
is classified as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S.
and the European Union, has been fighting for autonomy in
largely Kurdish southeast Turkey for three decades. Gaziantep
province borders Syria.  “Terror is causing market stress and tension,” Murat Yardimci, head of trading at ING Bank AS, said in e-mailed
comments. Investors are pricing “the possibility of
continuation of these attacks and an intervention on Syria.”  Turkish authorities will also examine the possibility of
Syrian involvement in the attack, Huseyin Celik, deputy head of
the governing  Justice and Development Party , told NTV
television, adding Syrian intelligence has been working with the
PKK.  The central bank lent today 1 billion liras ($557 million)
at its lowest 5.75 percent funding rate, the same amount
provided last week in its one-week repurchase agreements
auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
