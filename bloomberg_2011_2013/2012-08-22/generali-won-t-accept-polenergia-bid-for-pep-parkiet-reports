Generali OFE, the largest
shareholder of  Polish Energy Partners SA (PEP) , said Polenergia
Holding SA’s bid price for the renewable energy producer is
“unsatisfactory,” Parkiet reported, citing Chief Investment
Officer Rafal Markiewicz.  Polenergia, owned by the Polish billionaire Jan Kulczyk,
offered 31.5 zloty per share for PEP on Aug. 10. The price
“does not reflect the fundamental value of the company” and
doesn’t offer “premium for taking over the firm operating on a
prospective market,” Markiewicz told Parkiet.  Generali holds 19.9 percent of PEP shares.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
