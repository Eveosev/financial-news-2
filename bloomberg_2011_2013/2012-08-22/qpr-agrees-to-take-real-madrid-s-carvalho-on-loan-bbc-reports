Queens Park Rangers agreed to take
Real Madrid defender  Ricardo Carvalho  on a season-long loan, the
British Broadcasting Corp. said on its website.  Carvalho has yet to agree to contract terms with the
Premier League club, with talks scheduled over the next 48
hours, the BBC said. The 34-year-old may be reunited with former
Chelsea teammate  Jose Bosingwa , who joined QPR last week on a
free transfer.  QPR manager Mark Hughes is looking to strengthen his
defense following a season-opening 5-0 home loss to Swansea four
days ago. The BBC said yesterday QPR agreed to buy Tottenham’s
Michael Dawson for 7.5 million pounds ($11.9 million).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
