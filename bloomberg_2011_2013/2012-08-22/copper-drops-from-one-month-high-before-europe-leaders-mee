Copper declined after touching a
one-month high yesterday as some investors were concerned about
demand ahead of a euro-area finance ministers meeting.  Three-month delivery metal fell as much as 0.8 percent to
$7,550.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, before
trading at $7,578 by 1:47 p.m. in  Shanghai . The contract rose as
much as 2.4 percent yesterday, the most since July 3. December-
delivery copper dropped 0.4 percent to $3.448 a pound on the
Comex in  New York .  “Considering the weak demand, copper probably won’t have
much further upside,” Lian Zheng, an analyst at Xinhu Futures
Co., said from Shanghai. “Now that European leaders are back
from holidays, the debt crisis will be in focus again.”  French President  Francois Hollande  is due in Berlin
tomorrow to discuss the crisis with German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel  as the  European Central Bank  fleshes out its plans. Japan
today reported a wider-than-estimated trade deficit in July at
517.4 billion yen ($6.5 billion) following a surplus in June.  The ratio of three-month copper to aluminum rose to a
record 4.1 yesterday, and was at 4.07 today. Global apparent
demand for copper  outpaced  supply by 21,000 tons in May, and
refined copper balance for the first five months indicated a
deficit of 405,000 tons, the International Copper Study Group
said in a report yesterday.  Copper for December-delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed 0.6 percent to 55,190  yuan  ($8,686) a ton.  Physical demand for copper and zinc in the first half of
the year was at least as good as during 2011, while nickel and
chrome usage was disappointing, Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive
officer of Glencore International Plc., said yesterday.  On the LME, aluminum also fell, while lead, nickel and zinc
were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
