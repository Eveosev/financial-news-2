Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) ,  South
Africa ’s biggest food and goods wholesaler, will spend about 2.6
billion rand ($313 million) in the second half of this year and
2013 as it expands and plans to open as many as 40 new stores.  Massmart expects net trading margins to start climbing from
2014 once the company “overcomes the hurdles” of increasing
its number of distribution centers and upgrading its technology
systems, Chief Executive Officer Grant Pattison said on a
conference call today.  Massmart shares have climbed 21 percent since South
Africa’s Competition Tribunal in May last year approved
Bentonville, Arkansas-based  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s (MMT)  acquisition
of a controlling stake in the company.  Massmart, with close to 340 stores in 12 African countries
south of the Sahara, spent a record 1.7 billion rand in
replacement and expansion costs in the fiscal year ended June
25. The company, which increased its cash from operations by 63
percent to 2.7 billion rand, isn’t planning to raise money to
fund growth as internal cash flows are adequate, Pattison said.  Net income rose 40 percent from a year earlier to 1.17
billion rand in the year, the Johannesburg-based company said in
a statement today. Sales increased 16 percent to 61.2 billion
rand. Trading profit, or earnings before interest, taxes and
some financial items, rose 3.8 percent to 2.3 billion rand.  The company plans to open 30 to 40 stores in the next 18
months, with five of these in  Africa  outside its home market,
Pattison said. Africa expansion is being slowed by the company’s
difficulties in securing property, he said.  Purchase Approved  Massmart rose 0.3 percent to 169.50 rand at the close in
Johannesburg, bringing the stock’s gain in the past 12 months to
11 percent, compared with a 43 percent gain for the FTSE/JSE
Africa General Retailers Index.  Wal-Mart’s purchase of 51 percent of Massmart was approved
last year, subject to conditions including the setup of a 100
million-rand fund to assist local suppliers and promises not to
fire employees. While the transaction is “legally complete”
Massmart is still waiting for the final court ruling on the
makeup of the fund and the company has not been notified of the
date, Pattison said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
