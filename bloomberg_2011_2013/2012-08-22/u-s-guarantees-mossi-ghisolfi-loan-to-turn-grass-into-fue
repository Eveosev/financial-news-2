A unit of the Italian chemical
company Gruppo Mossi & Ghisolfi received a loan guarantee from
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  to build a cellulosic ethanol
refinery in North Carolina.  USDA approved an 80 percent guarantee on a $99 million loan
for  Chemtex International , according to a statement today. The
facility in Sampson County will convert 600,000 tons of non-food
grasses into as much as 20 million gallons (76 million liters)
of ethanol a year.  President  Barack Obama  is promoting wider use of renewable
energy sources, including biofuels, as part of an effort to make
the U.S. energy independent. USDA has funded eight other
refineries that convert agricultural waste, wood, municipal
garbage and algae into fuel.  “At USDA, we are focused on the production of renewable
energy from a wide variety of non-food sources, including energy
grasses,” Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, said in the
statement.  Chemtex, based in Wilmington, North Carolina, received $3.9
million from the USDA in June to grow more than 4,000 acres of
miscanthus and switchgrass. Those feedstocks will be combined
with enzymes from Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based  Novozymes A/S (NZYMB)  to
produce fuel, Paige Donnelly, a Novozymes spokeswoman, said in
an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
