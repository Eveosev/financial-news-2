Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is developing
a natural-gas field called Midyan in the northwestern part of
the kingdom, the Eqtisadiah newspaper reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Khalid al-Falih.  The gas will be used for power generation, al-Falih told the
Riyadh-based  daily .  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, has released the
engineering, procurement and construction tenders for the Midyan
gas processing project that will cost about $800 million, MEED
said on its website yesterday.  The field is forecast to produce 75 million cubic feet a
day of gas and 4,500 barrels a day of condensate for a 20-year
period, according to MEED, the Middle East business news service.
Gas from Midyan will be transported by pipeline to a power 
plant in the coastal town of Duba, 135 kilometers (84 miles) 
southwest of the field, MEED said.  The bid deadline for the tender submissions is mid-October
with completion scheduled for 2015, MEED said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
