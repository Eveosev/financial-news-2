The Czech Finance Ministry is
against a plan that would make the government guarantee prices
of electricity produced by nuclear power stations,  Hospodarske
Noviny  reported, citing a ministry document.  The Ministry of Industry and Trade proposed in its long-
term energy strategy that the state provide the guarantees
before the construction of new units at the Temelin nuclear
power plant, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
