Soybeans fell from the highest price
on record and corn declined on speculation that the worst
drought damage to U.S. crops has passed, while reports showed
fields in  Indiana  were in better shape than expected.  Participants on the annual Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour
estimated Indiana corn yields at 113.3 bushels per acre, better
than the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s forecast for the  state 
of 100 bushels an acre, according to findings yesterday. Field
samples showed a 9.2 percent decline in  soybean  yield potential,
compared with last year, while the USDA projects an 18 percent
drop. Indiana was the fifth-largest corn and soybean growing
state last year.  “We are following what happens in the U.S. on the Pro
Farmer tour,” Arnaud Saulais, a broker at Starsupply Commodity
Brokers, said by phone from Nyon,  Switzerland . “There were some
reports from Indiana with higher-than-expected yields. It seems
to be mixed.”  Soybeans for November delivery fell 0.6 percent to $17.22 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 7:28 a.m. Chicago time.
Earlier, the oilseed climbed to an all-time high of $17.3425.
Futures surged 43 percent this year, the most on the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities, as U.S. drought followed
dry weather that cut South American output last season.  Corn for December-delivery dropped 0.5 percent to $8.3425 a
bushel in Chicago, after reaching $8.40 yesterday, the highest
for the most-active contract since a record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Drought affects 87 percent of U.S. corn crops and 85
percent of soybeans, the National Climatic Data Center said Aug.
16. Dry weather also has lowered water levels on the Mississippi
and Ohio rivers, shutting some thoroughfares and delaying barge
traffic.  Midwest Rains  Storms later this week in the western Midwest may bring
less than 0.5 inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain, while areas of
Illinois and  Minnesota  may see moisture next week, according to
an AccuWeather Inc. report. Crop tour results in Nebraska
yesterday showed smaller corn and soybean  yield  potential than
the USDA’s forecast.  Wheat for December delivery fell 0.9 percent to $9.14 a
bushel in Chicago, the first drop since Aug. 14. In Paris,
November-delivery milling wheat declined 0.7 percent to 266
euros ($331) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe. The grain has rallied
31 percent since mid-June as dry weather cut yields in  Russia ,
raising concern that the country would restrict exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
