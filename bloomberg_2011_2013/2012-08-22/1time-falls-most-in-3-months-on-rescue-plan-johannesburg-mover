1time Holdings Ltd. (1TM)  fell the most in
three months after saying its operating subsidiaries will begin
business rescue proceedings and be placed under supervision.  Shares in the South African low-cost airline and technical
maintenance company declined 50 percent, the most since May 24,
to close at 7 cents in Johannesburg, the lowest since June 8.  There is a “reasonable prospect” of saving the
“currently financially distressed” 1time Airline Pty Ltd. and
Jetworx Aircraft Services Pty Ltd., 1time said in a statement
late yesterday. Rescuing the airline is dependent on enough
capital being raised to sustain it through the carrier’s current
difficulties, said Keith McLachlan, a senior equities analyst
for small and mid-cap companies at Thebe Stockbroking Pty Ltd.
in Johannesburg.  “The  airline industry  locally is really in the perfect
storm of low demand, high input costs, increasing competition
and the marginal players are the ones most affected,” McLachlan
said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
