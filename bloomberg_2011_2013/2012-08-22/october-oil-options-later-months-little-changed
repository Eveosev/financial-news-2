Volatility on near-term and later-
month crude options was little changed as futures rose on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will increase stimulus efforts.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
October, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 28.12 percent at 3:37 p.m. in  New
York , up from 28.08 percent yesterday.  Volatility on December options fell to 30.49 from 30.7
percent yesterday.  Crude oil for October delivery rose 71 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $97.55 a barrel on the Nymex.  Futures advance as minutes from a July 31-Aug. 1 meeting of
Fed policy makers showed that many said additional stimulus
would probably be needed soon unless the economy shows signs of
a durable pickup.  Implied volatility on calls protecting against a 10 percent
rise in futures were little changed at 30 percent as of 3:41
p.m. Puts protecting against a 10 percent decline were 31
percent, almost unchanged from the day before.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $90 puts, which fell 9 cents to 65 cents a barrel at
3:45 p.m. with 1,839 lots trading. October $100 calls were the
second-most active options, with 1,720 lots changing hands as
they rose 11 cents to $1.79 a barrel.  Bearish bets accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading
today. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor

traded.  December $100 calls were the most actively traded options
