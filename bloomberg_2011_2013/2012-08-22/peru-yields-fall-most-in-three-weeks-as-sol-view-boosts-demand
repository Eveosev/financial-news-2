Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in three weeks, as the central bank’s efforts to
curb swings in the sol boost the appeal of local-currency debt.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.60 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.24 centimo to 121.31 centimos per
sol.  The central bank has purchased $785 million in the  spot
market  this month to slow the sol’s advance. The currency
touched a 15-year high yesterday as foreign direct investment,
economic growth and a  trade surplus  boost inflows.  “The bonds are attractive because yields remain
interesting” for carry-trade investors while the sol remains
relatively stable, said Diego Llona, a trader at  Banco Santander 
in Lima.  In the carry trade, investors buy higher-yielding assets
with funds borrowed from countries with lower interest rates.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.6140 per U.S. dollar,
from 2.6110 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
