LG Electronics Inc. of South Korea
sued a joint venture of  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and Samsung Electronics
Co. in federal court in Delaware alleging infringement of four
U.S. patents for optical-disc technology.  Lawyers for Seoul-based LG said in today’s complaint that
Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology Corp. of Tokyo knew about the
inventions because it licensed the patents until the end of
2010.  The defendants “have failed to renew their license to the
patents-in-suit, and defendants therefore knowingly remain
unlicensed,” LG officials said in court papers.  The inventions, patented since 2000, cover rewritable and
record/playback media used in computers, camcorders and video
recorders, according to court papers.  LG is asking for a  jury trial , unspecified damages based on
lost profits and “no less than a reasonable royalty” for use
of the inventions.  A Toshiba spokeswoman, Rebecca Bueno, in Irvine,
California, didn’t immediately return voice and e-mailed
messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. Kasia McManamon,
representing Samsung in Ridgefield Park,  New Jersey , didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail and phone call seeking comment.  The case is  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  v. Toshiba Samsung Storage
Technology Corp., 12cv1063, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patents in the lawsuit, click: 6,101,162;
