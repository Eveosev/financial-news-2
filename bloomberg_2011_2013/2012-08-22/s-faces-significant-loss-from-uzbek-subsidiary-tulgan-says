OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) ,  Russia ’s
biggest mobile phone company, faces a ‘significant’ loss from
its operations in Uzbekistan after the nation’s authorities
removed its license.  “We are looking at a significant loss of value in
Uzbekistan,” Joshua Tulgan, director of investment relations at
MTS, as the Russian company is known, said by phone from Moscow.
“We are discussing possible scenarios for our second-quarter
disclosure.”  MTS invested about $1.5 billion in the Uzbek unit, he said.
The company is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on
Aug. 28, Tulgan said.  Uzbekistan froze the company’s license on July 17, saying
MTS violated its permit and didn’t pay enough taxes. The
authorities prolonged a suspension of MTS’s local unit’s license
for three months from July 30, the company said in a July 29
statement. The unit’s acting chief financial officer and three
other employees have been imprisoned since mid-July, Tulgan
said.  “Four of our colleagues remain imprisoned, and we are
actively seeking their release,” Tulgan said. “We are
considering legal strategies but right now it is too early to
comment on any definitive steps.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
