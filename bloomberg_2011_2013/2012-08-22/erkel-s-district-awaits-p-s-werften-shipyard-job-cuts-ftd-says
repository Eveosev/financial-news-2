German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
electoral district by the  Baltic Sea  is bracing for shipyard job
losses after the federal and regional governments refused to
award further state funding to shipbuilder P+S-Werften, the
Financial Times Deutschland reported.  Almost 2,000 jobs are at risk at the company’s yards in
Stralsund and Wolgast after Merkel’s Christian Democratic-led
government and the Social Democratic-led state administration in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania declined to provide more
subsidies, the FTD said. The company has been in difficulty
since 2009 and hasn’t delivered a ship since April, the
newspaper said.  “It’s a great crew, which naturally makes today all the
harder,” Merkel was cited as saying yesterday. “The state’s
role has been exhausted.”  More than half a dozen German shipyards have gone bust
since the financial crisis amid a reduction in orders and
increased competition from  China , Japan and  Korea , the FTD said.
Sixty-seven yards are still registered in Germany, with total
revenue of 4.6 billion euros ($5.7 billion) in 2011, down from
7.5 billion euros in 2010. Ruediger Fuchs, chief executive
officer of P+S-Werften, is seeking a private investor for the
yards, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
