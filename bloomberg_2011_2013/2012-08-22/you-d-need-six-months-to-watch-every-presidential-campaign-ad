At 30 seconds a spot, and sometimes
60, it would take more than six months to watch all 526,633
presidential election ads that have run on television since the
general election began in earnest in early April.  It breaks down to roughly one spot promoting President
 Barack Obama  or attacking Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  for
every spot taking the opposite stance for the Nov. 6 election,
according to data compiled by New York-based Kantar Media’s
CMAG, which tracks ads on national network, national cable and
local broadcast stations.  Of the 526,104 presidential ads supplied by groups that
paid for at least 200 such commercials to run from April 10,
when Romney effectively clinched his party’s nomination, to Aug.
20, the last day for which data are available, 264,542 came from
campaigns or groups that favor Romney and 261,562 came from pro-
Obama organizations. That’s a partisan breakdown of 50.3 percent
Republican to 49.7 percent Democratic.  While the cumulative total points to partisan parity, it
hasn’t been like that for long stretches of the campaign.  Obama had the edge on  TV advertising  in the spring,
followed by Romney and Republican allies having the advantage on
television for most of the summer.  The pro-Obama advertising effort is coming overwhelmingly
from the president’s own campaign, which has aired more than 10
times as many ads as an allied super-political action committee,
Priorities USA Action, which is headed by former Obama White
House aides.  Pro-Romney Groups  The push to elect Romney is far more reliant on outside
groups, including super-political action committees and 501c
nonprofit groups that are focusing their ads on attacking Obama.
Crossroads GPS, a nonprofit founded with the help of Republican
strategist  Karl Rove , and Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney
super-PAC, have together supplied more ads than Romney’s
campaign.  While the two parties are at cumulative parity in TV
advertising for the presidential race, the Republican side is
pulling ahead as the campaign enters its final months.  In the 14-day period ending Aug. 20, the pro-Romney side
aired 52,637 ads and the pro-Obama side ran 38,706 spots, a 58
percent to 42 percent split, CMAG data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
