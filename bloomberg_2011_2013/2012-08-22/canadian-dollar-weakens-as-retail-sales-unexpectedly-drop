Canada’s dollar pared an earlier
decline after minutes from the last meeting of the  Federal
Reserve  showed policy makers remain committed to additional
monetary easing if needed.  The currency had dropped earlier against a majority of its
most-traded peers, falling along with the dollars of fellow
commodity exporters Australia and New Zealand as demand for
safety drove the greenback and yen higher and a report showed
retail sales unexpectedly fell in June. Bank of Canada Governor
 Mark Carney  reiterated in a speech that interest rate increases
may become appropriate.  “Higher-beta currencies are all gaining versus the  U.S.
dollar  on the back of increased easing expectations,” said
Brian Kim, a currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc in  Stamford  Connecticut. “Carney reiterating that the Bank
of Canada could remove stimulus is Canadian-dollar supportive.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, weakened 0.4
percent to 99.33 cents per U.S. dollar at 2:24 p.m. in Toronto.
It touched 98.43 cents yesterday, the strongest level since May
3. It weakened as much as 0.6 percent today. One Canadian dollar
buys $1.0068.  To contact the reporter on this story:
