Kenya ’s benchmark coffee grade fell
for a second time since the restart of weekly auctions last week
after supplies increased, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The benchmark AA sold for an average of $271.42 for a 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bag from $275.23 on Aug. 14, the exchange
said today by e-mail from Nairobi, the capital.  Supplies of the grade climbed 21 percent to 1,798 bags, and
it sold for as little as $156 and as much as $310 a bag,
compared with last week’s range of $198 to $340, it said. The
average price for all the coffee sold dropped the first time
since the restart of auctions, retreating 2.2 percent to $166.14
a bag, it said.  “Generally there was little demand from our overseas
buyers,” Mansukh Shah, a coffee dealer at Nairobi-based
Alanwood Ltd., said by phone. “The quality of the beans was a
bit low.”  Sales at the auction fell to 10,605 bags worth $2.14
million from 10,695 bags valued at $2.21 million last week amid
increased supplies, the exchange said.  Supplies at the auction climbed to 24,845 bags from 23,333
bags at the previous sale, the agency said. Kenya harvests its
early crop from May through July, while the main crop is reaped
from September through December. Its coffee season runs from
Oct. 1 through September.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
