The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped 0.1 percent to 674.6 at 5:13 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
declined 0.1 percent to 1,594.982.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near its highest in three months in  New York  as
risks to global supplies countered concern that an economic
slowdown will curtail fuel consumption.  Crude for October delivery was at $96.90 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , down 6
cents at 9:11 a.m.  London  time. The September contract, which
expired yesterday, rose 71 cents to $96.68, the highest close
since May 10. Front-month prices are 2.3 percent lower this
year.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 33 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $18.97 a barrel at 10:11
a.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a broker. Gasoil swaps for September rose 5 cents to
$130.45 a barrel, PVM data showed. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil
declined 5 cents to 60 cents a barrel.  High-sulfur fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 97
cents to $4.83 a barrel, the biggest gap since May 11, according
to PVM. Fuel-oil swaps for September fell $3.75, or 0.6 percent,
to $677.25 a metric ton, PVM data showed.  BASE METALS  Copper declined after touching a one-month high yesterday
as some investors were concerned about demand ahead of the
meetings between euro-area leaders.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold was seen climbing for a sixth day in London on
speculation European leaders may agree steps to contain the debt
crisis. Platinum reached a three-month high.  Immediate-delivery bullion rose 0.2 percent to $1,640.35 an
ounce by 9:14 a.m. in London. Prices reached $1,641.48
yesterday, the highest since May 7 and a sixth consecutive gain
would be the longest run since June 18. December-delivery
futures were little changed at $1,644 on the Comex in New York.  Platinum for immediate delivery climbed as much as 0.5
percent to $1,515.12 an ounce, the highest since May 8, and was
last at $1,514.63. Police shot dead 34 people near  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s
Marikana site on Aug. 16 after striking workers refused to
disperse. Ten people, including two police officers, were killed
in clashes around the property of the third-biggest platinum
producer the week before. Output at Marikana has been at a
standstill since Aug. 10.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans increased to a record after a crop tour showed
yields would fall in the U.S. as the worst drought in half a
century damaged crops. Wheat dropped for the first time in more
than a week.  Soybeans for November delivery were little changed at
$17.3175 a bushel at 14:27 p.m. Singapore time after climbing to
an all-time high of $17.3425 on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures have surged 43 percent this year, the most on the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities.  Corn for December-delivery was little changed at $8.3775 a
bushel in Chicago, after reaching $8.40 yesterday, the highest
price for the most-active contract since a record $8.49 on Aug.
10. Wheat for the same month fell 0.4 percent to $9.1825 a
bushel, the first drop since Aug. 14.  Rubber fell after  Japan  reported a wider-than-expected
trade deficit, deepening concerns that  Europe ’s debt crisis will
damp needs for industrial products and weaken demand for the
commodity used in tires.  January-delivery rubber dropped as much as 1.5 percent to
216.9 yen a kilogram ($2,735 a metric ton) before settling at
218.6 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The most-active
contract has lost 17 percent this year.  Palm oil  climbed the most in almost two months after
soybeans rose to a record as an annual crop tour in the U.S.
showed yields fell because of the worst drought in half a
century, raising concerns supplies will drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
