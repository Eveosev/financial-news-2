Cicor Technologies (CICN)  fell the most in
more than two months after reporting an 11 percent drop in
first-half sales, citing weaker domestic demand and uncompleted
pilot projects in  China .  Cicor fell as much as 6.3 percent, the biggest drop since
June 1, and was down 4.8 percent at 30.45 Swiss francs by 10:46
a.m. in Zurich. That gave the Boudry, Switzerland-based circuit-
board maker a market value of 87 million francs ($90 million).  Cicor’s second-quarter revenue fell to 84.4 million francs
from 94.6 million a year earlier, it said today in statement on
Tensid newswire. Earnings before interest and tax advanced to
2.49 million francs from 2 million francs.  Cicor had “mixed results with microelectronics being the
big culprit for the miss,” Andy Schnyder, an analyst at
 Vontobel Holding AG (VONN)  based in Zurich, who recommends buying the
stock, said in an note to clients. “We will meet the management
and revisit our investment case.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
