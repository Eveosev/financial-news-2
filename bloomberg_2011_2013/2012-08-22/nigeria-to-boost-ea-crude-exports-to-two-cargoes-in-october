Nigeria , Africa’s largest oil
producer, plans to increase exports of EA crude to two cargoes
of 950,000 barrels each in October, one more than September,
according to a loading plan obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The nation will also ship two consignments of Okono and one
cargo each of Abo and Amenam, separate loading programs showed.
The size of each lot is from 400,000 to 950,000 barrels.  Shipping schedules of Erha, Pennington and Okwori aren’t
available yet. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
