China ’s overnight money-market rate
fell the most in seven weeks on signs the central bank is
boosting efforts to ease a cash squeeze in the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China added a total 220 billion yuan
($34.6 billion) via  seven-  and 14-day reverse-repurchase
agreements yesterday, according to a statement on its website.
The monetary authority also gauged demand for an issuance of
such contracts tomorrow, according to a trader required to bid
at the auctions.  “Cash shortage may ease temporarily,” said Liu Junyu, a
bond analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the
nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “But the bigger the amount of
reverse repos this week, the bigger the redemption next week.”  The one-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 41 basis points, or 0.41
percentage point, to 3.09 percent as of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai ,
the biggest decline since July 4, according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  China’s finance ministry sold 30 billion  yuan  of 10-year
bonds today at an average yield of 3.39 percent, according to a
statement on Chinabond’s website. The yield compared with the
3.365 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 10
fixed-income analysts and traders. The sale drew 1.35 bids times
the amount on offer, according to the statement.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, rose seven
basis points to 3.23 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on the 3.51 percent government bond due
February 2022 increased four basis points to 3.40 percent,
according to the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
