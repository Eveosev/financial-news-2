OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , the Russian oil
producer controlled by OAO Gazprom, started test output from the
first well drilled at the Novoport field, targeting year-round
production at the Arctic field in 2014.  Drilling of that well started in May, and construction of
infrastructure continues at the field, Gazprom Neft said today
in a  statement  on its website.  Novoport, the northernmost producing field in Russiaâ€™s
Yamal region, holds recoverable reserves of more than 230
million metric tons of crude and 270 billion cubic meters of
gas, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
