Best Buy Co. (BBY) , the consumer- electronics retailer shunning a takeover attempt by its founder, will pay its new Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly a base annual salary of $1.175 million.  Joly will be eligible for a fiscal 2014 bonus of at least $8.75 million, the Richfield, Minnesota-based company said today in a regulatory filing. Best Buy will give Joly $3.5 million and various stock awards to cover compensation he forfeited by leaving his previous employer.  The 53-year-old Joly, CEO of hotel operator Carlson Cos., will start at Best Buy in September, replacing interim CEO  Mike Mikan . Richard Schulze, who had been chairman, left Best Buy in June and is trying to purchase the company for as much as $9.5 billion with the help of private-equity partners.  Best Buy reported second-quarter profit today that trailed analysts’ estimates and suspended its earnings forecast as sales of computers and televisions dropped. Net income fell 91 percent to $12 million, or 4 cents a share. Excluding certain items, profit was 20 cents a share. The average of 21 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 31 cents.
