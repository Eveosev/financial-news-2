Treasury 10-year yields slid the
most in almost three months after minutes of the  Federal
Reserve ’s last meeting showed many policy makers said additional
stimulus would probably be needed soon unless the economy shows
signs of a durable pickup.  U.S. 30-year yields fell the most in seven weeks as the
central bank bought $1.8 billion of longer-term Treasuries as
part of an effort to cap borrowing costs.  Bill Gross , who runs
the world’s biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management
Co., wrote on Twitter there’s an 80 percent chance of a third
round of Fed debt purchases under quantitative easing and an
extension of the pledge to keep interest rates at almost zero.  “They gave the market what it wanted to hear,” said
 William Larkin , a fixed-income  money manager  who helps oversee
$500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc. in Salem,
 Massachusetts . “They can’t take away talk about QE3 because the
market built up momentum on that belief. It would make sense to
have that as a potential driver going forward.”  The 10-year  yield  tumbled 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 1.69 percent at 5:16 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It was the biggest
intraday decrease since June 1. The price of the 1.625 percent
security due in August 2022 rose 31/32, or $9.69 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 3/8. The yield, which reached a record low 1.379
percent on July 25, yesterday touched its 200-day moving average
of 1.86 percent.  Thirty-year bond  yields  dropped 10 basis points to 2.80
percent in their biggest intraday slide since July 2.  They
increased for the past two days above their 200-day moving
average of 2.96 percent.  Volume Increases  Treasury trading volume reported by ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , jumped to about
$284 billion in New York, from $208 billion yesterday. The daily
volume has averaged $239 billion this year.  Volatility dropped to 66.8 basis points, the lowest level
since July 26, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE
index. The figure is below the 2012 average of 75 basis points.
Volatility dropped to a five-year low of 56.7 basis points on
May 7 and touched a 2012 high of 95.4 basis points on June 15.
The index measures price swings based on options.  The difference between the yields on the two-year note and
the 30-year bond narrowed to the least in more than a week. The
gap, called the yield curve, decreased to 255 basis points, the
least since Aug. 13, from 261 basis points yesterday. The 2012
average is 268 basis points.  ‘Additional Support’  Many participants at the Fed’s July 31-Aug. 1 meeting said
that a new large-scale asset-purchase program “could provide
additional support for the economic recovery,” according to the
record of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s gathering released
today in  Washington .  The central bank purchased $2.3 trillion of mortgage and
Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds quantitative
easing. It also has pledged to keep its key  interest rate  at
zero to 0.25 percent, where it’s been since 2008, until at least
late 2014.  “The minutes were slightly more dovish than I had
expected,” said Gary Pollack, who helps manage $12 billion as
head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private
Wealth Management unit in New York. “It implies that QE3 is on
the table and could be implemented fairly soon if the economic
data doesn’t turn around. Since then, the data have been
stronger than the market anticipated.”  Sales, Payrolls  Retail sales  rose 0.8 percent in July, the first increase
in four months, a Commerce Department report showed on Aug. 14.
Industrial production gained 0.6 percent, more than forecast,
Fed figures showed the next day. Payrolls added 163,000 jobs,
the most in five months, the Labor Department said Aug. 3.
Still, the  unemployment rate  has remained stuck above 8 percent
for more than three years.  “Many members judged that additional monetary
accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless
incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable
strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery,” the
minutes said.  The term premium, a model created by economists at the Fed
that includes expectations for interest rates, growth and
inflation, shows Treasuries are the most expensive since Aug. 6.
The gauge was negative 0.84 percent today, after reaching
negative 0.70 percent on Aug. 16, the least costly since May. It
reached a record negative 1.02 percent, the most expensive level
ever, on July 24. A negative reading indicates investors are
willing to accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  Note Auctions  The U.S. is scheduled to announce tomorrow the sizes of its
auctions next week of two-, five- and seven-year notes.  It will probably sell $35 billion of two-year debt on Aug.
28, the same amount of five-year notes the following day and $29
billion of seven-year securities on Aug. 30, according to
Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory company based in  Jersey
City ,  New Jersey .  U.S.  government securities  have lost 1.4 percent this
month, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  The Fed bought Treasuries today due from February 2036 to
February 2042 as part of its effort to exchange shorter-term
 U.S. debt  in its holdings for securities due in six to 30 years
to put downward pressure on long-term borrowing costs.  The central bank has been accelerating purchases of more
newly issued Treasuries as part of the program while primary
dealers’ willingness to offer securities to the central bank
ebbs. It included the current 30-year bond in the range of debt
it would consider today, but didn’t buy the maturity.  Japanese Trade  Government  securities , which fell for the past four weeks,
advanced earlier after Japanese trade figures fell short of
economists’ forecasts, adding to concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
and a slowdown in  China  are damping global growth.  Japan ’s exports fell 8.1 percent in July from a year
earlier, the Ministry of Finance said in  Tokyo . Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a decline of 2.9 percent.  Japanese  shipments to the European Union  slumped 25
percent, the biggest drop since October 2009, and those to China
slipped 12 percent, the ministry said. European governments are
struggling to find ways to pay their debts, while China’s  gross
domestic product  growth has slowed for six quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
