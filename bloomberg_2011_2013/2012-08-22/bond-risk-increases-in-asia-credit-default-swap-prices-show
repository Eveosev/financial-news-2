The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in Asia rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  increased 1 basis point to 146 basis
points as of 8:43 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge reached a five-month low of
145.8 basis points on Aug. 20, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index advanced 1 basis point to
188.5 as of 9:15 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
The index is on course for its highest close since Aug. 8,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 0.75 of a basis
point to 149.25 basis points as of 10:15 a.m. in Sydney,
according to Deutsche Bank.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
