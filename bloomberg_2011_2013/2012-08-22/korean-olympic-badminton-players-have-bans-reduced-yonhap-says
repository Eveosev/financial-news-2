Four South Korean women badminton
players expelled from the London Olympics for deliberately
performing poorly had their bans reduced after an appeal, Yonhap
News reported.  Jung Kyung Eun, Kim Ha Na, Ha Jung Eun and Kim Min Jung,
“are suspended from domestic and international play for six
months, down from the two years recommended last week,” Yonhap
News said, citing the Badminton Korea Association.  Calls and e-mails to the Badminton Korea Association and
the  Badminton World Federation  weren’t immediately answered.  On Aug. 1, eight Chinese, South Korean and Indonesian
players in the women’s doubles at the Olympics, were
disqualified by the Badminton World Federation for not playing
to win.  The teams may have been attempting to lose to avoid more
difficult opponents in the quarterfinals, when the competition
moved to a knockout stage. The teams had already qualified out
of the group competition, which was new in this year’s Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
