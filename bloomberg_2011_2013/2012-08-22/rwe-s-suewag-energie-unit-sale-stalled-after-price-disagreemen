RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s second-largest
utility, failed to sell its Suewag Energie AG unit to a group of
bidders because of a disagreement over price.  “We don’t sell at any price,” Peter Hoscheidt, a
spokesman for the Essen-based company, said today in a phone
interview. No further talks are planned, according to a
statement by Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH, part of
the group of municipalities and regional suppliers bidding for
the unit.  There are other interested parties for RWE’s 78 percent
stake in the Frankfurt-based unit, Hoscheidt said.  RWE is under pressure to sell assets and cut costs after
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  ordered the permanent halt of
all nuclear reactors by 2022 following Japan’s Fukushima atomic
meltdown.  Standard & Poor’s  gave slow progress in a 7 billion-
euro ($8.7 billion) disposal program as one reason for
downgrading the stock last month.  “We are keeping to the timetable to execute it by the end
of 2013,” Hoscheidt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
