Malaysia’s ringgit rose the most in
more than two weeks after  Germany  indicated it may be willing to
relax  Greece ’s bailout conditions, increasing demand for riskier
assets.  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, whose government
favors an extension of its fiscal adjustment program by two
years, travels to Berlin and Paris on Aug. 24 and 25 to discuss
the country’s deficit reduction efforts as part of terms to
receive European help to tackle its debt crisis.  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  is considering easing the requirements, two German
lawmakers said last week.  “It seems like Germany is willing to ease some of the
pressure on Greece,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist
at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “In the near term, emerging market
currencies like the ringgit will be trading sideways but the
bias is for them to strengthen eventually.”  The ringgit gained 0.3 percent, the most since Aug. 6, to
3.1230 per dollar as of 4:03 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency closed at 3.1323 on
Aug. 17 and trading resumed today after the Eid al-Fitr holidays
on Aug. 20 and yesterday. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined
10 basis points to 6.60 percent.  Government bonds  advanced. The yield on the 3.314 percent
notes due October 2017 fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.32 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
