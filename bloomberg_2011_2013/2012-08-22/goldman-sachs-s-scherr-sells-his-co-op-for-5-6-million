Stephen M. Scherr, head of financing
and  Latin America  at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , sold his Fifth
Avenue co-op in Manhattan for $5.6 million, almost four months
after buying a home on Park Avenue.  The sale of Scherr’s fifth-floor apartment at 1148 Fifth
Ave. was completed on Aug. 9 and made public yesterday,
according to New York City Department of Finance  records . The
buyers were listed as Esther and Marcel Kremer.  The apartment is one of 59 units in a  “white glove” 
prewar building between 95th and 96th Streets, with views of
 Central Park , according to property-listings website
StreetEasy.com. In April, Scherr bought a  seven-bedroom , full-floor co-operative apartment at 1185 Park Ave. for $12.3
million, according to public records and StreetEasy.  Scherr didn’t immediately return a telephone message left
at his  New York  office.  Scherr, who oversees Goldman Sachs’s operations in Latin
America and runs underwriting, was appointed to the firm’s
 management committee  in January. The 30-member committee
“oversees the global activities of the firm” and “is
comprised of the most senior leaders of the firm,” according to
the firm’s  annual report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
