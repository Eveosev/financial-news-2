Google Inc. (GOOG)  is heading north of the
Arctic circle to map a region of  Canada  with a history of
dashing the hopes of explorers.  Employees of Google, the world’s most popular search
engine, are in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut this week to capture
images to be used on the company’s mapping and “Street View”
applications.  The hamlet of 1,500 people is located in Canada’s Arctic
archipelago along the Northwest Passage, and is known as “good
fishing place” in the local Inuit dialect.  British explorer Sir John Franklin mapped the community’s
coastline on an expedition in 1845 that ended with the
expedition’s ships becoming lost in the Arctic waters.  It is the furthest north Google, which is based in  Mountain
View ,  California , has traveled to map a community, said company
spokesman Aaron Brindle in an e-mail.  Members of the hamlet will participate in a “map up” in
which they will use Google software to identify landmarks, said
Karin Tuxen-Bettman, Google lead for the project. Company staff
will then tour the community on a specially-designed tricycle
mounted with several cameras, she said, to record a 360-degree
view of the area that is only accessible by air.  “They warned us that it’s not going to be like working at
the Google campus,” Tuxen-Bettman said in a phone interview.
“We’ve been pleasantly surprised by the connectivity.”  The company is looking to expand the project to other
Arctic communities, she said. “This time next year, we may be
even further north.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
