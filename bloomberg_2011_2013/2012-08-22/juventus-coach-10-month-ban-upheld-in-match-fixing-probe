Italy’s soccer federation upheld the
10-month suspension of  Juventus Football Club SpA (JUVE)  coach  Antonio Conte  for failing to report a match-fixing incident, rejecting
his appeal of the initial ruling earlier this month, the
organization said today in a  statement  published on its website.  The probe is part of a broader scandal involving match-
fixing and illegal betting. The Italian police in May arrested
Stefano Mauri, the team captain of SS Lazio SA, and prosecutors
probed Conte as part of an international investigation into
match-rigging in the nation’s soccer leagues.  The federation acquitted Conte of wrongdoing in the game
between Novara and Siena on May 1, 2011, while confirming the
suspension because he failed to report a match-fixing incident
regarding the game between Albinoleffe and Siena on May 29,
2011, the soccer federation said. Conte was Siena’s coach at the
time.  Juventus will now appeal to the National Sport Arbitration
Court of the Italian Olympic Committee, the club’s Chairman
Andrea Agnelli said in a  statement  published on the soccer
club’s website. Conte “is and will be Juventus coach,” Agnelli
said in the statement. “Those who think that these judicial
events could affect our season are mistaken.”  --Andrew Davis, Eddie Buckle  To contact the reporter on this story:
