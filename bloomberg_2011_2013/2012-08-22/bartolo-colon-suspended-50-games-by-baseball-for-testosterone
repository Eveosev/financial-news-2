Pitcher  Bartolo Colon , who at the
age of 39 has helped the Oakland Athletics challenge for a Major
League Baseball playoff berth, received a 50-game suspension
after failing a test for testosterone.  Colon, a two-time All-Star and 2005 American League Cy
Young Award winner, said he accepted responsibility for his
actions in a statement released by the MLB Players Association.
His suspension comes one week after San Francisco Giants
outfielder Melky Cabrera, whose .346 batting average is second-
best in baseball, was given a 50-game ban after testing positive
for testosterone.  “I apologize to the fans, to my teammates and to the
Oakland A’s,” said Colon, who has a 10-9 record with a 3.43
earned-run average this season.  In his last five starts, he was 4-1 with a 1.57 ERA.
Oakland, in second place in the  American League East , has gone
23-13 since the All-Star break and at 67-56 is challenging for a
wild card playoff berth.  The Athletics have 39 regular-season games left after
Colon’s suspension started with yesterday’s 5-1 win over the
 Minnesota Twins . He’d also have to miss 10 games if the A’s
reach the postseason before being eligible to return.  Oakland got pitcher Brett Anderson back two days ago
following his recovery from Tommy John surgery on his elbow. The
left-hander allowed one run over seven innings in winning his
season debut.  “It’s disappointing,” A’s General Manager Billy Beane
said about Colon’s suspension. “We’re fortunate to have depth
in starting pitcher and it’s time to rely on that depth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
