Julius Baer  Group Ltd. has made a
“generous assumption” for a U.S. tax matter, Chief Financial
Officer Dieter Enkelmann told  Finanz und Wirtschaft .  Enkelmann was replying to the newspaper’s question on
whether Julius Baer’s Aug. 20 decision to cut a rights offer by
250 million francs ($259 million) would affect the bank’s
ability to settle a  U.S. Department of Justice  probe of Swiss
firms that allegedly helped American customers hide money from
the  Internal Revenue Service .  Julius Baer, which has previously said the penalty the bank
expects to pay isn’t “reliably assessable,” declined to
comment further when contacted by  Bloomberg News .  Julius Baer cut a rights offer proposed on Aug. 13 to 500
million francs from 750 million francs after shareholders
criticized the bank for not specifying what 250 million francs
of the money was for, FuW reported.  Julius Baer seems to have widespread shareholder support
for acquiring Bank of America Corp.’s non-U.S. Merrill Lynch
units, the Zurich-based newspaper reported, citing an interview
with Enkelmann, who added that a “good portion” of the assets
should be absorbed by the end of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
