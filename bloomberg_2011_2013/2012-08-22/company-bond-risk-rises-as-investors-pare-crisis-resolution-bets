The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt rose as  Japan ’s trade deficit widened
and  Greece  asked for more time to reform its economy.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 7.5 basis points to 568.5
at 10:25 a.m. in London, after falling from 752 on May 17. An
increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality ;
a decline, the opposite.  Japan reported a deficit of 517.4 billion yen ($6.5
billion) as shipments to the European Union fell by the most
since the crisis started in Greece almost three years ago.
Investors pared bets the turmoil will be resolved before
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , the head of the
euro group of finance ministers, visits Greece today.  “There’s been quite a sharp tightening of credit of late,
so there’s a small reaction the other way,” said  Elisabeth
Afseth . “Japanese trade data indicated weaker growth on a more
global scale and people are waiting for whatever comments come
out of Greece.”  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose two basis points to 139 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased four basis points to 231 and
the subordinated index climbed seven to 395.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments rose three basis points to 231.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
