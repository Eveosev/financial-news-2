Egypt doesn’t intend to devalue the
Egyptian pound, the state-run Al-Ahram reported today, citing
Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed, ahead of a meeting with the
IMF to discuss a request for a $4.8 billion loan.  The  International Monetary Fund  didn’t impose conditions on
the loan request made more than a year ago for $3.2 billion, El-
Saieed said, adding that a devaluation was not a consideration.  The IMF’s  Christine Lagarde  is to meet with Egyptian
President Mohamed Mursi, Prime Minister Hisham Qandil and
Mursi’s economic team today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
