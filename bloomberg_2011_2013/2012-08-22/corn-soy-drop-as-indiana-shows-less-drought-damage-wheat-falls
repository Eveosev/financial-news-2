Corn and soybean futures declined on
speculation that the worst U.S. drought since 1956 caused less
crop damage than the government expected in  Indiana , the
nation’s fifth-largest grower. Wheat also fell.  Field surveys conducted yesterday during the annual
Professional Farmer Crop Tour showed corn production may reach
113.3 bushels an acre, compared with an Aug. 10 forecast of 100
bushels by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Soybean-pod
counts from yesterday’s samplings showed a 9.2 percent drop from
last year, implying a yield drop from last year to 40.9 bushels
an acre. The USDA forecast 37 bushels on Aug. 10.  “We were expecting to see a train wreck in the fields, and
this isn’t quite the train wreck we were expecting,” Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting
in Lafayette, Indiana, said by telephone. “This calls into
question whether the USDA will have to lower its production
estimate next month.”  Corn futures for December delivery declined 0.5 percent to
settle at $8.3475 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price yesterday reached $8.40, the highest since
touching a record $8.49 on Aug. 10. The most-active contract is
up 65 percent since mid-June.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$17.2775 a bushel on the CBOT, after reaching a record $17.3425.
The price is up 31 percent since June 15.  Wheat futures for December delivery slumped 0.5 percent to
$9.17 a bushel in  Chicago , the first decline since Aug. 14.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
