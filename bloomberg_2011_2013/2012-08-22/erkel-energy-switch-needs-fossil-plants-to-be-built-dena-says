Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s plan to
exit nuclear-energy generation and switch to renewables means
Germany will have to  rely on fossil-fired plants to make sure
the lights stay on, a state-owned energy researcher said.  Utilities need to build 49 gigawatts of new coal- and
natural-gas fired plants by 2030 because wind and solar panels
don’t produce around the clock, Dena said today. While Germany
targets an 80 percent-share of renewables in its power mix by
2050, fossil plants will still have to provide most of the
secured capacity, it said in a study commissioned by  RWE AG (RWE) , the
German utility that mainly relies on coal.  “The pressure to build new fossil-fired plants now is very
high,” Stephan Kohler, the head of Dena, told reporters in
Berlin today. He also called for a European “capacity market”
to ensure that fossil plants are commissioned even as their
economic viability is undermined because renewables get priority
in the German mix.  Merkel is shifting  Germany  away from nuclear power in favor
of renewable sources such as solar and wind following the
meltdown in  Japan  last year. The plan is estimated to cost 200
billion euros ($249 billion), according to the DIW economic
institute in Berlin.  Germany’s energy supply in 2050 will “cost significantly
more” than today’s in part because the country will have to
import about 134 terawatt-hours of electricity a year, or 22
percent of its demand, Kohler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
