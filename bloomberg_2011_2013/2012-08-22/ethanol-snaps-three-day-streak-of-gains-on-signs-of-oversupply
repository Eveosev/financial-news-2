Ethanol futures fell for the first
time in four days after stockpiles of the fuel increased from a
week earlier.  Prices declined after the Energy Department said
 inventories  climbed 46,000 barrels to 18.5 million, up 1.4
percent from a year earlier. Production of conventional gasoline
blended with ethanol was steady at 5.42 million barrels a day.  “It was just a knee-jerk reaction that you didn’t get a
draw,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 0.3 cent to
settle at $2.664 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
futures have gained 21 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 2 cents to $2.73 a
gallon in  New York  and 0.5 cent to $2.79 on the West Coast, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. The price fell 1.5 cents to $2.635
in  Chicago  and 1.5 cents to $2.695 on the  Gulf Coast .  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, fell 4 percent to 3.65 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. They are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
