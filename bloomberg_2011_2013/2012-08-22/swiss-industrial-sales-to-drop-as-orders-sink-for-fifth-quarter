Swiss Industrial companies may have
declining sales in the second half after a 1.4 percent rise in
the first six months, mechanical and electrical engineering
trade group Swissmem said in a statement.  New orders for the 290 members of Swissmem, which include
 ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  and OC Oerlikon AG, dropped for a fifth successive
quarter as declining exports to European Union countries and
pricing pressure on exports from  Switzerland ’s strong franc mean
“there will be no short-term improvement,” Swissmem said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
