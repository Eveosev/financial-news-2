Bank Vozrozhdenie said net income
advanced 72 percent for the second quarter compared with a year
earlier as the Russian lender reported an increase in loans to
small- and medium-sized enterprises.  Profit under International Financial Reporting Standards
rose to 678 million rubles ($21 million) from 395 million rubles
a year earlier, according to a  statement  today on the Moscow-
based company’s website. Net interest income, the difference
between what a bank earns from lending and what it pays on
deposits, gained 22 percent on “enhanced business activity.”  “After subdued activity in the beginning of the year,
lending gained momentum, and we’ve managed to increase loan
portfolio in the most attractive segment for us - small and
medium enterprises,” Tatiana Gavrilkina, deputy chairman of the
management board, said in the statement.  Non-performing loans declined to 8.1 percent of the bank’s
lending portfolio by the end of June compared with 8.7 percent
for the first quarter.  The  shares  rallied 2.9 percent to 612.1 rubles by 12:33
p.m. in Moscow, poised for their biggest gain in a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
