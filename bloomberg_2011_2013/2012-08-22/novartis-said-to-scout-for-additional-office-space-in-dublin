Novartis AG (NOVN) , Europe’s largest
drugmaker by revenue, is looking for  office space  in Dublin and
may lease an additional 100,000 square feet (9,300 square
meters), two people with knowledge of the matter said.  IDA Ireland, the government agency that seeks overseas
investment, is working with Novartis, said the people, who asked
not to be named because the company hasn’t yet decided whether
to expand. A building at Elm Park about six kilometers (3.7
miles) from the center of the Irish capital is one of the
properties being considered by the Basel, Switzerland-based
company, one of the people said.  Ireland’s corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent and tax
credits for research-and-development investments has attracted
companies like Novartis, which employs more than 500 people in
the country. Medical and pharmaceutical companies exported more
than 24.3 billion euros ($30 billion) of goods from Ireland in
2010, about 27 percent of Irish exports, according to the
country’s statistics office.  “We never comment on client companies,” IDA spokesman
Emmet Oliver said by e-mail. Novartis spokesman  Eric Althoff 
declined to comment.  Office rents in Dublin have fallen by more than 50 percent
since their peak about five years ago, according to a report by
the IDA. No office properties have been built in the city in two
years, broker  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)  said in a report last month.  Novartis has units in Dublin and the village of
Ringaskiddy, according to the latest accounts filed at the
Companies Registration Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
