Swiss President Eveline Widmer- Schlumpf said the U.S. could have indicted two or three other
banks in addition to Wegelin & Co. if the companies hadn’t
turned over information containing employee names,  Tribune de
Geneve  reported.  The Federal Council authorized Swiss banks to deliver
employee data to the U.S. to avoid “destroying workplaces,”
Widmer-Schlumpf told the newspaper. She didn’t name any banks.
Wegelin agreed to sell its non-U.S. business to  Switzerland ’s
Raiffeisen Group on Jan. 27, one week before the bank was
indicted in the U.S. for allegedly helping Americans evade
taxes.  In the same interview, Widmer-Schlumpf said buying CDs with
stolen bank data to force asset declarations is closer to
“organized crime” than tax collection.  While it’s unacceptable for politicians to boast about
buying illegal CDs, German states haven’t confirmed the
purchases, Widmer-Schlumpf told the newspaper. North Rhine-
Westphalia has regularly been the subject of reports it bought
CDs with Swiss account information on German clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
