The following is the text of
 Canada ’s retail sales report for June as released by
 Statistics Canada .  Retail sales declined 0.4% to $38.7 billion in June, more
than offsetting the gain in May. Lower sales were reported in 7
of 11 subsectors, representing 64% of retail trade.  In volume terms, retail sales edged down 0.1%.  General merchandise store receipts fell 1.5% in June. Store
closures contributed to lower sales at department stores (-2.6%).
Sales at other general merchandise stores declined 0.6%.  Gasoline station sales decreased 1.3%, reflecting lower
prices at the pump. This was the sixth decrease in eight months.  Building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers
reported a 2.1% sales decline. Lower receipts in recent months
may reflect in part an advance of spring sales for this store
type in February and March.  Sales at  motor vehicle  and parts dealers decreased 0.4%.
After peaking in January 2012, sales in this subsector have been
on a downward trend. Lower receipts at new car dealers (-0.6%)
and at other motor vehicle dealers (-1.3%) accounted for the
June decline. Gains were reported by used car dealers (+1.8%)
and automotive parts, accessories and tire stores (+0.4%).  Furniture and home furnishing stores (-0.5%) reported a
fifth sales decrease in six months. Home furnishing stores
declined 1.8% in June and have been on a downward trend since
the beginning of 2012. Sales at furniture stores increased 0.3%.  Food and beverage store receipts rose 0.5%. Higher sales at
supermarkets and other grocery stores (+1.0%) accounted for most
of the increase.  Following declines in April and May, sales at electronics
and appliance stores rose 1.1% in June.  Sales decrease most in Alberta  Retail sales fell in six provinces in June. Alberta (-1.3%)
reported the largest decline in dollar terms after posting the

series (2002) is a chain Fisher volume index with 2002 as the
reference year.  Starting with the next release, total retail sales
published in volume, including the chain Fisher volume index,
will be revised from January 2004 onward to reflect
methodological enhancements. In addition, the reference year
will change from 2002 to 2007 for these volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
