India’s bonds gained on speculation
the highest yields in more than two weeks will lure investors.  The nation’s  economy  may expand 6.7 percent in the year
that began April 1, less than the 7.6 percent forecast in
February, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s economic panel said in
a report on Aug. 17. Lenders should follow  State Bank of India (SBIN) ,
the nation’s largest bank that cut interest rates this month, in
lowering borrowing costs to help revive investment, Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said on Aug. 18.  “Bond investors were probably adding to their holdings as
the yield levels are attractive,” said N.S. Venkatesh, Mumbai-
based head of treasury at state-run  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  “The growth
dynamics and expectations of interest-rate easing are also
broadly supportive of bonds.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell
three basis points to 8.22 percent in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The rate earlier touched 8.26
percent, matching a level touched last week, which was the
highest level since Aug. 3.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points to 7.81 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
