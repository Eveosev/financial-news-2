(Corrects second paragraph to show number of Class A
shares.)  Facebook Inc. co-founder Dustin
Moskovitz sold 450,000 shares in the operator of the worldâ€™s
largest social-networking website, the latest holder to divest
holdings after a lock-up restriction expired last week.  The sale, at prices from $19.38 to $20, leaves Moskovitz
with 7.05 million Class A shares, according to a filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
