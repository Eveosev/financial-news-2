Mifa Mitteldeutsche Fahrradwerke AG (FW1) ,
the largest German manufacturer of bicycles, bought insolvent
competitor Steppenwolf GmbH to add buyers for its conventional
pedal-powered models.  Mifa acquired all of Steppenwolf’s “significant assets,”
including the sports-bike maker’s brand rights and sales
network, the Sangerhausen, Germany-based company said in a
statement yesterday. Mifa didn’t disclose the purchase price.  “Through Mifa, Steppenwolf will be able to boost its sales
again, as Mifa’s customer base is larger,” Mark Appoh, an
outside financial spokesman for the bikemaker, said by phone
today. “Further acquisitions are possible but nothing is
planned yet.”  Mifa  sold stock  to current investors in July to fund
acquisitions. It bought a majority stake in Berlin-based
electric-powered bike manufacturer Grace GmbH in March. Munich-
based Steppenwolf filed for insolvency on July 26 and
proceedings started yesterday, Mifa said.  “As early as 2013, we expect positive impulses through
Steppenwolf,” Mifa Chief Executive Officer Peter Wicht said in
the statement. “Along with e-bikes, we also regard high-quality
bicycles for independent bicycle dealers as a growth market for
us.”  Mifa rose as much as 2.5 percent to 8.10 euros at 10:55
a.m. in  Frankfurt , valuing the company at 73.1 million euros
($91.2 million).  The bikemaker’s biggest shareholder is entrepreneur Carsten Maschmeyer, whose current stake is  28 percent , Appoh said.
Maschmeyer made his fortune by founding financial services
broker AWD Holding AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
