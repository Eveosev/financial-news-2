The value of United Nations
Certified Emission Reduction credits will be 30 percent of
European Union carbon allowances by the end of the year,
compared with 38 percent currently, said  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)   UN Emission Reduction Units will be 25 percent of the value
of EU permits by Dec. 31, compared with 34 percent now,  Matthew Gray , an analyst at Jefferies in London, forecast yesterday in
an e-mailed research note.  The discount for both UN offset types will widen on higher
supply of ERUs and because traders will swap more expensive CERs
for ERUs, the investment bank said.  The discount for CERs compared with EU permits for December
widened yesterday to the most since May 31 last year, as the
European permits advanced to their highest in more than five
weeks. The spread widened as much as 6.2 percent to 5 euros a
metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London and had
narrowed to 4.90 euros today as of 12:42 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
