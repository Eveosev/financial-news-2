The Chilean peso gained, reversing
an earlier decline, as copper rose in  New York  on  data that
showed  U.S. sales of existing homes accelerated in July.  The peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 481.17 per  U.S. dollar 
as of 11:53 a.m. in Santiago. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin
American Currency Index fell 0.1 percent.  Copper climbed 0.1 percent on the Comex in New York after
the U.S. data. The metal, used in wiring and pipes for new
homes, accounts for more than half of Chile’s exports. The peso
is the second-best performing currency in the world this year as
faster-than-forecast  growth  has led the central bank to to keep
its benchmark  interest rate  at 5 percent, luring investors
seeking higher yields than available in developed markets.  “The Chilean peso doesn’t have much room to weaken.” said
Alejandro Araya, a currency trader at Banco Santander Chile in
Santiago.  The currency will trade at 485 per dollar in seven days and
weaken toward 500 per dollar at the end of the year, according
to the median forecast of 51 traders and investors in a central
bank survey published today.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
had an $8.5 billion bet against the currency on Aug. 20, up from
$8.1 billion a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
