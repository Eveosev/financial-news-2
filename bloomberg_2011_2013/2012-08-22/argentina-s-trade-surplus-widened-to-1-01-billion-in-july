Argentina ’s  trade surplus  widened to
$1.01 billion in July from $657 million a year earlier, the
national statistics institute said.  Exports rose 1 percent from a year earlier to $7.4 billion,
while  imports  fell 4 percent to $6.4 billion, the agency said in
Buenos Aires today. Economists expected a surplus of $1.05
billion, according to the median estimate of six economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg.  The government of President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 
tightened import restrictions earlier this year in a bid to
protect local producers from competition from foreign goods and
prevent the country’s trade surplus from narrowing.  The restrictions prompted the U.S. and Japan to file
separate complaints against the South American country at the
World trade Organization. Both governments said that “these
measures restrict imports of goods and discriminate between
imported and domestic goods.”  Argentina responded yesterday with a WTO complaint against
a U.S. ban on imports of Argentine beef and citrus fruits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
