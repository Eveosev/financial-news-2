The U.K.  Financial Services
Authority  intends to ban the marketing of complex investment
products involving assets such as wine, crops and timber to
retail consumers.  The regulator found “high levels of unsuitable advice”
and the “potential for customer detriment,” in a review into
products known as Unregulated Collective Investment Schemes, the
FSA said today. Around 85,000 retail investors already have
direct holdings in UCIS, according to the agency.  “This situation needs to change and so we are acting now
to prevent these products being marketed to ordinary retail
investors in the future,” Gavin Stewart, acting director of
policy at the FSA, said in an e-mailed statement.  The FSA has increased pressure on banks to be transparent
in their dealings with retail customers.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  was fined
7.7 million pounds ($12.3 million) in January last year for
failing to disclose risks in two funds it sold to thousands of
retirees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
