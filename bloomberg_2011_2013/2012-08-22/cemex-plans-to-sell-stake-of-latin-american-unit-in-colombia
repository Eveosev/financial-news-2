Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in the Americas, said it has filed an application with Colombian
authorities to sell a minority stake in its unit Cemex Latam
Holdings SA.  The subsidiary will have substantially all Cemex’s assets
in Central and  South America , the company said today in an e-
mailed statement. Cemex Latam Holdings SA will not have Mexican
assets, according to the statement.  Cemex plans to carry out a public offering in  Colombia  and
a concurrent private placement to investors outside the country,
the Monterrey, Mexico-based company said in the statement. Cemex
didn’t specify the stake it intends to float on the Colombian
bourse and in the private sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
