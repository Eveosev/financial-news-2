Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG) , eastern
 Europe ’s biggest insurer, increased to the highest in almost
five months after profit exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The stock advanced 2.2 percent to 842.5 koruna, its highest
closing price since March 28, making it the best performer in
the PX equity index, which rose 0.7 percent. In Vienna, VIG’s
home market, the stock rose 1.7 percent to 34 euros.  Net income climbed to 113.6 million euros ($142 million) in
the second quarter, up 7 percent from a year earlier, as gross
written premiums jumped 19 percent, the Austrian company said
today. That beats the 109 million-euro average estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We consider the results positive,” said Milan Lavicka,
an analyst at J&T Banka AS in  Prague , in an e-mail to clients
today. “An economic slowdown in Europe has not been reflected
in emerging Europe’s insurance markets so far, and thanks to a
rather conservative investment strategy the company has not been
affected by risks stemming from the debt crisis in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
