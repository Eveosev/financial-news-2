Nigerian oil workers grouped under
the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, or
Nupeng, plan to start a national strike tomorrow to protest
delays in subsidy payments to fuel importers and retailers, an
official said.  “The strike is going ahead tomorrow as planned,” Isaac
Aberare, general secretary of the union, said today by phone
from Lagos, the commercial capital. Union officials will discuss
the dispute later today with Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala, a meeting that could possibly head off the walkout.  Africa ’s top oil producer depends on fuel imports to meet
domestic needs and pays importers the difference between
regulated prices and import costs. In January, the two biggest
trade unions in the country organized a week-long strike when
President Goodluck Jonathan tried to scrap the subsidy. The
strike and protests shut down businesses and threatened oil
production, forcing the government to partially reinstate it,
raising the gasoline price to 97 naira a liter, or $2.35 a
gallon, from 65 naira.  The  Finance Ministry  said on Aug. 16 that fuel importers
and retailers in  Nigeria  threatening a strike over unpaid
subsidy bills are trying to force the government to pay
unverified claims. Importers alleging they haven’t been paid are
trying to “blackmail” the government in order to avoid
sanctions for fraudulent claims, the ministry said, referring to
allegations of false claims by importers.  A parliamentary committee said in April the government paid
1.1 trillion naira illegally to importers between 2009 and 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
