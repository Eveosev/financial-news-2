Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG) , eastern
 Europe ’s biggest insurer, said second-quarter profit climbed 7
percent after premium growth offset weather-related claims.  Net income rose to 113.6 million euros ($141 million) from
106 million euros a year earlier, the Vienna-based company said
today in a slide presentation. That beat the 109 million-euro
average estimate of nine analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  “We fully comply with our target of keeping volatilities
low and improving profitability on a sustainable basis,” Peter Hagen, who took over as chief executive officer in June, said in
a statement. The insurer didn’t give a specific profit forecast.  Vienna Insurance, which derives more than half its earnings
from the former communist bloc, reported a 19 percent increase
in gross written premiums. The insurer, which has about 1.5
billion euros of excess capital after being outbid in January
for  KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s Polish unit, said it doesn’t rule out
acquisitions “rounding off the portfolio.”  Vienna Insurance climbed 1.6 percent as of 9:24 a.m. in
Vienna trading, bringing this year’s gain to 11 percent. That
compares with the 19 percent advance in the 32-member STOXX
Insurance 600 index of European insurers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
