The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell to the lowest level in 13 months,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 31.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
at 10:24 a.m. in  London , from minus 34 yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was 36 basis points below Euribor
from minus 36.5 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they see each other
lending in euros, was set at a record low 0.310 percent from
0.318 percent yesterday. The benchmark, derived from a daily
survey of banks for the European Banking Federation, fell for
the thirteenth day.  The Euribor-OIS spread, a measure of banks’ reluctance to
lend to each other, held near the lowest since July 7, 2011. The
spread was little changed at 24.5 basis points.  The EBF’s euro overnight index average, or Eonia, was set
at a record low 0.103 percent yesterday, from 0.109 percent the
day before. An estimate of future average overnight borrowing
costs in euros, the three-month Eonia swap, was 6.5 basis
points, the lowest since Aug. 1, from 6.9 yesterday.  Banks cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  to 327 billion euros ($407 billion)
yesterday from 333 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
