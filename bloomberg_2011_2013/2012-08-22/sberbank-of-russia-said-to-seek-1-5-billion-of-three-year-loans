OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, is seeking to raise $1.5 billion from a three-year  term
loan , according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  Sberbank is proposing to pay interest of 150 basis points
more than the London interbank offered rate, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the deal is private.  That would be the same margin the Moscow-based lender
agreed to pay on its $1 billion three-year loan signed in
November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Alexander Baziyan, a spokesman for Sberbank in Moscow,
couldn’t immediately comment when contacted by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
