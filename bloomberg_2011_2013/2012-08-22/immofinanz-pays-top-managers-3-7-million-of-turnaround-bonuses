Immofinanz AG (IIA) , the Austrian
developer that verged on collapse in 2008, paid managers led by
Chief Executive Officer Eduard Zehetner a bonus this year for
restoring the company to profitability.  Zehetner and two board members in charge since 2008,
Manfred Wiltschnigg and Daniel Riedl, received 3 million euros
($3.7 million) between them in May, Immofinanz said in its
annual report  today . Their individual holdings in the company
weren’t disclosed.  “Immofinanz Group was successfully directed out of the
life-threatening crisis in the 2008/09 financial year, and
equity and the net asset value were substantially increased,”
Immofinanz said in the report. “Furthermore, dividend payments
were made possible.”  Immofinanz, based in Vienna, came close to bankruptcy after
the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
roiled global markets. Zehetner and his colleagues merged the
company with its eastern European unit, Immoeast AG, froze
expansion plans, settled disputes with former affiliates and
sold assets to build up cash reserves.  Immofinanz trades at more than  nine times  its 28-cent low
in November 2008, and dividend payments resumed last year. The
shares have gained about 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
