American stocks are outperforming
global equities by the most in fourteen years amid better-than-
estimated corporate earnings and speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will act to stimulate the world’s largest economy.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index has risen 12 percent this year, compared with a 6.1
percent gain in the MSCI World Excluding United States Index.
That’s the biggest outperformance since 1998, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The U.S. is the best house in a bad global economic
block,” E. William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC
Wealth Management in Philadelphia, said in a phone interview.
His firm manages about $112 billion. “Corporate results have
been better than expected. Still, while the most recent jobs
data beat estimates, it’s not good enough. So quantitative
easing is an open question,” he said, referring to asset
purchases to stimulate the economy.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 26 percent during the past 12
months. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index is up 22 percent since August
2011, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.4 percent.  About 72 percent of S&P 500 companies reporting second-
quarter results have beaten analysts’ earnings estimates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time,
reports showed U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly contracted for a
second month in July and the  unemployment rate  has remained
above 8 percent since February 2009.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told a Senate panel last month
U.S. policy makers are “looking for ways to address the
weakness in the economy should more action be needed to promote
a sustained recovery in the labor market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
