Flooding returned to Russiaâ€™s
southern Russian region of Krasnodar, killing at least four
people and forcing the evacuation of more than 1,500, the
 Interior Ministry  said.  More than 300 houses were inundated by 2 a.m. today, the
ministry said in a statement. The worst flooding in decades
ravaged the region last month, killing at least 171 people and
