The ruble depreciated against the
dollar for the first time in three days as Japan’s trade deficit
widened more than expected and  Greece  sought more time on policy
changes, cutting investor appetite for riskier assets.  The Russian currency weakened 0.5 percent versus the dollar
to 31.8849 by the close in Moscow and fell 0.4 percent against
the euro to a three-week low of 39.7399. It slid 0.5 percent
against the central bank’s currency basket, which is 55 percent
dollars and 45 percent euros, to 35.4197.  Japan’s trade deficit widened to 517.4 billion yen ($6.5
billion) in July, compared with the 270 billion-yen median
forecast of 28 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. Greece asked
for more time to carry out policy changes and Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras said his country needs “more air to breathe”
in dealing with its debt crisis  “Wider-than-expected trade deficit reported by  Japan 
decreases investor appetite for risky assets including the
ruble,” said Andrey Volkov, head of foreign exchange and money
markets at ZAO Natixis Bank in Moscow.  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening against the
dollar, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
32.3848 in three months versus 32.2714 on Aug. 21.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose two basis points to 216,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. Yields on
the government’s ruble bonds due April 2021 rose three basis
points to 7.86 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
