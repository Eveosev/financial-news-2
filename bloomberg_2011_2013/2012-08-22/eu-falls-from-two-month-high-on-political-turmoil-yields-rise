The leu weakened from the strongest
level in almost two months and yields rose as the reinstatement
of President Traian Basescu added to concern  Romania ’s political
turmoil may intensify.  The leu depreciated as much as 0.4 percent to 4.4952 per
euro today, after strengthening 0.4 percent yesterday to the
highest since July 4. It traded 0.3 percent lower to 4.4908 per
euro at 5 p.m. in Bucharest. Yields on Romania’s dollar-
denominated debt maturing in 2022 climbed six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 5.73 percent, reversing a decline
yesterday to the lowest since the bond was sold on January 31.  A presidential impeachment referendum on July 29 was
invalid because participation of eligible voters was below the
50 percent threshold, the Bucharest-based  Constitutional Court 
said yesterday. The power struggle between the president and
Prime Minister Victor Ponta may continue until general elections
are held in the fourth quarter as Ponta has said future
collaboration with Basescu is “impossible”.  “The tension will prevail in the coming period and that
ruling coalition will be looking for other solutions to change
the current political setting, with negative consequences for
the leu,” analysts including Mihaela Neagu at OTP Bank Nyrt.
