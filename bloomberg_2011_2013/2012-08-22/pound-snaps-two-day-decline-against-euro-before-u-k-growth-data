The pound snapped a two-day decline
against the euro before a report this week that analysts said
may show Britain’s  economy  contracted less than previously
estimated in the second quarter.  Sterling strengthened versus most of its 16 major
counterparts. It slid to the lowest level in two weeks against
the 17-nation common currency yesterday. Gross domestic product
fell 0.5 percent from the first quarter, when it shrank 0.7
percent, according to the median estimate of 30 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The data will be released on Aug. 24.  The pound was 0.1 percent stronger at 78.95 pence per euro
at 7:59 a.m. London time. It fell to 79.08 pence yesterday, the
weakest level since Aug. 8. Sterling was little changed at
$1.5785.  Britain’s currency has lost 0.8 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar fell 2 percent and
the euro gained 0.8 percent over the period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
