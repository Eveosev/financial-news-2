Russia  is in talks with  Serbia  to
increase its financial support for the Balkan nation after
providing an $800 million loan for infrastructure projects,
Russia’s ambassador to Belgrade said.  “We need to see first what Serbia’s needs are, then we’ll
define the possibilities,” Alexander Konuzin told reporters
after meeting with Infrastructure Minister Milutin Mrkonjic in
Belgrade today. “I hope we’ll have concrete results very
soon,” he said, without elaborating.  The current loan will be used for repairing and upgrading
Serbian railroads and won’t be reallocated to prop up the
budget, Mrkonjic said, rejecting local media reports that $300
million would be used to narrow Serbia’s widening fiscal gap.  “The credit will be used as intended, for railroads,”
Mrkonjic said after meeting with Konuzin and representatives of
Russian Railways, whose subsidiary is to serve as the main
contractor in the projects.  Serbia’s economy will contract 0.5 percent this year, the
central bank said Aug. 15. The government of Premier Ivica Dacic
is preparing a cost-cutting plan after the six-month  budget
deficit  reached 111.2 billion dinars ($1.18 billion), almost
three-quarters of the full-year target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
