  Lux Island Resorts Ltd. (NRL) , the third-
largest hotel operator in Mauritius, fell to the lowest in 3 1/2
years after having its recommendation cut by Axys Stockbroking
Ltd. as the country grapples with a drop in European tourists.  Lux was lowered to reduce, the equivalent of sell, from
hold, along with larger  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH)  and  Sun
Resorts Ltd. (SUN) , according to research notes published today on the
website of Port Louis-based Axys. The broker started coverage on
 Constance Hotel Services Ltd. (CHSL)  with a sell rating and on Southern
Cross Tourism Co. with a hold recommendation.  The stock of Lux dropped 3.2 percent to 17.90 rupees, the
lowest since March 2009, by the 1:30 p.m. close in the capital.
New Mauritius, which has dropped 30 percent over the past 12
months, was unchanged at 58 rupees. Sun Resorts was unchanged at
31.80 rupees following a 43 percent drop over the past year.  Tourist arrivals for 2012 will contract 0.5 percent to
960,000, Statistics Mauritius said in a  report  yesterday, adding
that the drop will be led by a fall in visitors from Europe, its
main market, amid the region’s worsening debt crisis. The
 tourism industry , with textiles, is the biggest earner of
foreign currency in the Indian Ocean island nation.  Tourism will continue to suffer from its overdependence on
Europe, a weak euro, limited accessibility and unsustainable
indebtedness, Axys analysts Bhavik Desai and Melvyn Chung Kai To
said in the notes.  The industry’s debt doubled from December 2007 to 2011,
standing at 13.3 percent of gross domestic product, they said.
“The combined debt of the top four groups stands at an
astounding 27 billion rupees ($880.9 million) compared to 7.3
billion rupees in 2007,” the analysts said.  Hotel groups have spent more than budgeted to revamp their
luxury offerings while domestic operating profits are being
eroded by debt repayments, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
