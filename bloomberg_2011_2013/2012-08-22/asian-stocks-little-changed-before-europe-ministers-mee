Asian  stocks  dropped, with the
regional gauge retreating from a three-month high, after Japan
reported a wider-than-expected trade deficit and as investors
await developments from a euro-area finance ministers meeting
this week to discuss details of the bailout package for  Greece .  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 31 percent of sales
from Europe, fell 1.1 percent in  Tokyo .  Samsung Electronics Co. (DELL) ,
the world’s largest maker of computer memory chips, slid 1.4
percent in Seoul after customer Dell Inc. cut its full-year
profit forecast amid a slump in demand for personal computers.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd. declined 3.1 percent in Sydney after
Australia’s No. 2 oil producer posted first-half profit that
missed analyst estimates.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.5 percent to 120.64 as
of 7:40 p.m. in Tokyo, with almost two shares falling for each
that rose. Investor optimism that global central banks will take
action to stimulate economic growth has pushed the gauge up 11
percent from its June low.  “Markets should be pausing for breath until we see some
more central-bank action,” said Nader Naeimi , Sydney-based
head of dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.
The firm manages about $100 billion. “We’ve had a very strong
rally in the last few weeks based on the verbal signs of
intervention from the  European Central Bank . Authorities are on
the right track. It appears they are more united now.”  Trade Deficit  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.3 percent. The
nation’s trade deficit was 517.4 billion yen ($6.5 billion) in
July as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and a slowdown in China
dragged down exports, data released by the  Finance Ministry 
showed. That compares with a revised 60.3 billion yen surplus in
June and the median forecast of a 270 billion yen deficit in a
Bloomberg News survey of 28 analysts.  South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.4 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.2 percent and  New Zealand ’s NZX 50
Index fell 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index decreased
1.1 percent and China’s Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.5
percent.  Except for New Zealand, volume was below the 30-day average
on all Asian markets for which Bloomberg has data.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.2 percent
today. The  S&P 500  lost 0.4 percent yesterday, with the gauge
failing to remain above a four-year high, as technology shares
slumped.  Almost three years after the  European debt crisis  came to
light in Greece, the country remains at the heart of the turmoil
as contagion spreads to Italy and Spain.  Greece Concessions  French President  Francois Hollande  is due in Berlin
tomorrow to discuss the crisis with German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel . Concessions are possible for Greece if its Prime
Minister, Antonis Samaras, shows a willingness to meet the main
targets set out in his country’s bailout program, a senior
lawmaker with Merkel’s government said yesterday.  Companies that do business in Europe fell. Hutchison

technology companies posted the biggest declines among the 10
 industry groups  in the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index. (MXAP)   Semiconductor-related companies and Dell suppliers declined
after the world’s third-largest maker of personal computers
forecast full-year profit of $1.70 a share, less than the

estimates.  Samsung, Compal  Samsung Electronics lost 1.4 percent to 1.264 million won
