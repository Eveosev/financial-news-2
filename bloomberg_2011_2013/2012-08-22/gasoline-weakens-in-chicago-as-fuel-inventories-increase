Chicago  gasoline weakened after
inventories of the fuel rose for the first time in four weeks,
raising supplies in the region as the traditional driving demand
season ends.  Inventories of the motor fuel in the Midwest gained 681,000
barrels to 49.5 million last week, the Energy Department
reported. Supplies in the region rose above the 5-year average
for  this time  of year.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago increased 1.25 cents to 9 cents below futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:36 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 2.38 cents to
$3.0115 a gallon.  The discount for the same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3,
narrowed 0.37 cent to 4.13 cents.  PBF Energy Inc.â€™s Toledo, Ohio, refinery was attempting to
