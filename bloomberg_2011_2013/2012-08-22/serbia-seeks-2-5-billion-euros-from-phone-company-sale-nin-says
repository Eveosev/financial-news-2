Serbia is seeking to raise at least
2.5 billion euros ($3 billion) from the sale of Telekom Srbija
AD, its biggest phone company, NIN magazine reported, citing a
government official it didn’t name.  Leaders of the three main parties in the ruling coalition
agreed to sell the company by tender in 2013, NIN said.
Preparations for the sale may start this fall, postponing
Telekom’s debut on the stock exchange, the magazine reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
