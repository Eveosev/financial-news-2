Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM) , the owner of
the namesake,  Pottery Barn  and West Elm home-goods chains,
advanced the most in 17 months after increasing its full-year
earnings forecast.  The shares  jumped  9.6 percent to $41.91 at 9:59 a.m. in  New
York , after reaching $42.35 for the biggest intraday gain since
March 2011. Williams-Sonoma had declined 0.7 percent this year
through yesterday.  Offering more exclusive goods has improved profitability at
San Francisco-based Williams-Sonoma even as consumer demand has
been uneven, David Magee, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey in Atlanta, wrote in a note today. Proprietary goods
including  All-Clad waffle makers  are preventing customers from
comparison shopping at other retailers.  “While essentially all of Pottery Barn’s assortment is
proprietary in nature, only about 50 percent of Williams-Sonoma
content is exclusive but that number is growing,” wrote Magee,
who recommends buying the shares.  Full-year adjusted earnings per share will be $2.44 to
$2.51, up from a previous projection of $2.42 to $2.49,
Williams-Sonoma said in a statement yesterday. Analysts
projected $2.50, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Second-quarter gross margin widened to 38.3 percent of
sales from 37.9 percent a year earlier. Analysts had estimated
37.4 percent.  “Margin progress is an encouraging read,” wrote Magee.  Revenue increased 7.3 percent to $874 million. Sales gains
were led by West Elm, which saw a 16 percent improvement in
sales at stores open at least a year, and by Pottery Barn, whose
comparable sales advanced 12 percent. The namesake stores’ sales
dipped 0.4 percent.  Williams-Sonoma will open its first four company-owned
stores outside  North America  next year in Sydney, Chief
Executive Officer Laura Alber also said in yesterday’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
