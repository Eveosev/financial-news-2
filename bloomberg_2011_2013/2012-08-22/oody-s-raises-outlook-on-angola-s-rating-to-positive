Moody’s Investors Service raised the
outlook on  Angola ’s Ba3 credit rating to positive from stable
based on the nation’s growth outlook and rising oil output.  Growth is “underpinned by the gradual expansion of
Angola’s oil and gas sector, which will in turn continue to
support the country’s economic diversification and
infrastructure development,” the ratings company said in an e-
mailed statement from  London  today. The government will probably
continue to boost foreign-currency reserves, which stood at
$32.5 billion in June, providing “a credible buffer against
economic shocks.”  The economy of the West African nation, Africa’s second-
biggest  oil  producer, will grow 6.8 percent this year, after 3.9
percent in 2010, before slowing to 5 percent in 2013, the
 International Monetary Fund  said on July 17.  Large projects such as  Total SA (FP) ’s Pazflor deep-water oil-
production sites and a new liquefied natural gas facility are
coming on-stream and should allow oil output to exceed 2 million
barrels a day as early as 2013, Moody’s said. It also expects
the recent discovery of large reserves in the Kwanza basin to
support oil production.  “Angola’s Ba3 sovereign rating could be upgraded upon the
establishment of a fiscal stabilization fund or sovereign-wealth
fund large enough to cushion the impact on the government
finances of an external shock,” Moody’s said. The country’s key
rating constraint is its “very low institutional strength.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
