Nigeria ’s naira depreciated to the
lowest in more than a week as dollar demand increased after the
end of public holidays before a central bank auction.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer declined 0.3
percent to 158.23 a dollar, as of 11:35 a.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, the lowest on a closing basis since Aug. 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The naira has risen 2.7
percent this year, making it the best performing currency in
Africa after the Zambian kwacha.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria , which sells dollars to lenders
at auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays to support the naira
closed on Aug. 20 in observance of the Islamic public holiday.
The  interbank market  where lenders trade the currency was also
closed. Nigeria’s population of more than 164 million is split
almost equally between Christians in the south and Muslims in
the north.  “We are expecting higher dollar demand after the Eid el
Fitr holiday as no sales were made during the period,” Usman
Onoja, chief executive of Lagos-based Lovonus Bureau De Change
Ltd., said by phone today.  The central bank held its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged
at a record 12 percent on July 24 to contain inflation and
support the naira. The  inflation rate  declined to 12.8 percent
in July from 12.9 percent a month earlier, the Abuja-based
National Bureau of Statistics said Aug. 17.  Yields on the West African country’s 16 percent domestic
debt due 2019 fell 33 basis points to 15.55 percent according to
Aug. 17 prices on the Financial Markets Dealers Association
website. Borrowing costs on the nation’s $500 million of
Eurobonds due 2021 were little changed at 4.958 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated less than 0.1 percent to 1.9408 a
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
