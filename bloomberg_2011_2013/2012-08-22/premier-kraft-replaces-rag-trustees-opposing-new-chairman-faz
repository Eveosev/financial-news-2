(Corrects company name to Evonik in final paragraph.)  Hannelore Kraft, SPD premier of
North Rhine-Westphalia, appointed three new trustees for the RAG
foundation,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  wrote.  Former Minister for Economic Affairs Harry Voigtsberger,
Green Party co-founder Lukas Beckmann and former EON AG chief
human resources officer Christoph Danzer-Vanotti will replace
entrepreneurs Jens Odewald, Roland Oetker and Stephan Holthoff-
Pfortner in the RAG supervisory committee, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The outgoing trustees had opposed Kraft’s and IG-BCE
chairman Michael Vassiliadis’s plan to appoint Werner Mueller,
the former chief executive officer of RAG AG and Evonik
Industries AG, as new chairman of the foundation, FAZ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
