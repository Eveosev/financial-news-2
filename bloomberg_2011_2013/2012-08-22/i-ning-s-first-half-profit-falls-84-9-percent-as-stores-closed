Li Ning  Co., the Chinese sportswear
retailer founded by the former Olympic gymnast of the same name,
reported a 84.9 percent drop in first-half profit as it closed
some stores.  Profit for the six months ended June 30 slid to 44.3
million yuan ($6.97 million) from 294 million yuan a year
earlier, according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. That compares with the 109.3 million yuan
average of three three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales fell 9.5 percent to 3.88 billion.  The company “controlled the cost and efficiency of newly
opened stores and closed up some inefficient stores,” according
to its statement. The number of Li-Ning brand retail stores was
cut by 952 to 7,303, it said.  The retailer, which faces escalating competition from  Nike
Inc. (NKE) ,  Adidas AG (ADS) , and  Anta Sports Products Ltd. (2020) , in June
projected a “substantial” profit decline this year. To revive
earnings the company plans to clear inventory and invest in
marketing.  The sportswear company in July announced the departure of
Chief Executive Officer Zhang Zhi Yong. Founder Li Ning will
help run the company and Kim Jin Goon, a partner at private
equity firm TPG Capital, will become executive vice chairman,
the company said at that time.  In January, Li Ning agreed to sell 750 million yuan of
convertible bonds to TPG Capital and Singapore’s sovereign fund
to raise money for more stores and product development.  To contact the reporters on this story:
