Fourteen Nordic nuclear reactors run
by Vattenfall AB, EON AG,  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  and Teollisuuden Voima Oyj
are producing at a combined capacity of 62 percent, unchanged
from yesterday, according to data from company websites and
calculations by Bloomberg.  Forsmark-1, Oskarshamn-1, Oskarshamn-3 and Ringhals-4 in
Sweden and Loviisa-1 in  Finland  are out of service for
maintenance or repairs, and the remaining nine are online.  The table below lists all units and their utilization rates
based on latest available data. It shows current output and
installed capacity in megawatts and utilization in percent.  
*Data for Loviisa reactors were not available on Fortumâ€™s
website. Figures are an estimate based on real-time production
from transmission system operator Fingrid Oyj.  To contact the reporter on this story:
