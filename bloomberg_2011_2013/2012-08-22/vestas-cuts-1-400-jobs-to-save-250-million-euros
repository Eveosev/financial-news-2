Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  is cutting
an additional 1,400 jobs to lower costs by more than 250 million
euros ($311 million) in preparation for a decline in wind
turbines installations it expects next year.  The world’s biggest maker of the machines said it expects
to have 19,000 employees at the end of the year, down 16 percent
from the end of last year. It announced 2,335 cuts in January
and is still considering whether to eliminate 1,600 jobs in the
U.S., which depend on a tax credit that expires this year.  “We are now intensifying this which means we will get to
about 3,700 job cuts before year-end,” Vestas Chief Executive
Officer Ditlev Engel said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “On the Move” show with Francine Lacqua. “That’s
preparing for what we expect to be quite a tough 2013.” Engel
said he could “never rule out” more reductions.  Vestas is suffering from increased competition from rivals
such as  Nordex SE (NDX1)  in  Germany  and  Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. Ltd. (2208)  in  China  at the same time governments from
the U.S. to Europe are slashing subsidies. The shares fell after
the Danish company cut guidance for shipments this year and said
it expected them to fall in 2013.  “The industry is in very poor shape and overcapacity is
all over the place,” Heinz Steffen, an analyst at Fairesearch
GmbH & Co. in Kronberg, Germany, said today in a phone
interview. “The outlook for 2013 is not too promising. The PTC
will expire and it will be difficult to generate orders in the
U.S,” he said, referring to a tax credit for the wind industry
that expires at year-end which Congress has yet to renew.  Loss Widens  The loss for the first half widened to 170 million euros
from 30 million euros a year ago as margins narrowed, Vestas
said. After earlier rising the most since June 1, the shares
declined 6.4 percent to 31.77 kroner in Copenhagen.  The earnings were in step with guidance the company
released three weeks ago. Vestas’s cuts announced January would
have brought the overall headcount to 20,400.  With the new total to be eliminated in 2012 at 3,735 posts,
Vestas said about 1,000 employees have already departed, another
1,100 will go next month and the rest will leave before the end
of this year. The company said it will “evaluate” its U.S.
manufacturing footprint as it waits to see if lawmakers extend a
tax credit to the industry.  “Management at last got the message to restructure the
business more strongly than earlier,” Steffen said. “It looked
half-hearted when they announced just 2,335 job cuts earlier in
the year.”  Outsourcing Components  Engel said the company is looking to outsource
manufacturing of some components so long as it doesn’t
compromise turbine quality.  Of the 2,700 job cuts that remain this year, 55 percent
will be in  Europe  and  Africa , 25 percent in the Asia-Pacific
region, and 20 percent in the Americas, according to Vestas.
Those proportions work out to roughly 1,485 posts in Europe and
Africa, 675 in Asia-Pacific and 540 in the Americas.  Engel said in January that as many as 1,600 U.S. jobs are
at risk if lawmakers don’t extend the production tax credit
beyond year-end. The credit gives an incentive of 2.2 cents a
kilowatt-hour of wind power.  Vestas also reiterated full-year targets for revenue of 6.5
billion euros to 8 billion euros and a margin before interest
and tax of zero to 4 percent, while cutting predicted shipments
to 6.3 gigawatts from 7 gigawatts.  Vestas said it expects shipments to decline further to 5
gigawatts in 2013, hastening the need for job cuts. Lower
shipments “will result in a significantly lower activity level
in 2013 to which the company will naturally have to adapt,”
Vestas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
