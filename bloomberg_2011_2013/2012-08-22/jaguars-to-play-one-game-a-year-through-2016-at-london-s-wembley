The  Jacksonville Jaguars  will play a
regular-season game annually at Wembley Stadium in London from
2013 to 2016.  “Playing a home game in London over four seasons is
consistent with our vision to introduce and grow the Jaguars
brand globally,” team owner  Shahid Khan  said in a statement
yesterday on the team’s website.  The  National Football League  said it’s seeking to add a
second game in the U.K. to its 2013 calendar in addition to the
Jaguars’ game. Regular-season NFL games have been played at
Wembley since 2007.  The St. Louis Rams will host the  New England Patriots  at
Wembley on Oct. 28 this season. The Rams on Aug. 13 withdrew
from a commitment to play regular-season games in London in 2013
and 2014.  “We’ve had a tremendously positive reaction to our sport
in the U.K.,” NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  said. “Our goal
is to continue to grow the game and this commitment by the
Jacksonville Jaguars represents a major step forward in our
international efforts.”  Jacksonville’s 2013 opponent has yet to be determined.  NFL team owners approved the sale of the Jaguars to Khan,
the owner of auto parts maker Flex-N-Gate Corp., on Dec. 14.
Khan previously failed in an attempt to buy the Rams.  Jacksonville went 5-11 last season, finishing third in the
four-team American Football Conference South ahead of the
Indianapolis Colts, who tied the Rams for the worst record in
the league at 2-14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
