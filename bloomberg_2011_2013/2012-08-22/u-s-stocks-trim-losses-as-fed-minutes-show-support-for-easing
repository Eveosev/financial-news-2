U.S. stocks trimmed losses as
minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting showed many
policy makers favored more monetary easing soon.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down less than 0.1
percen t at 1,412.63 at 2:02 p.m. in  New York . The gauge was
down about 0.4 percent before the release of the minutes at 2
p.m. in  Washington .  “Many members judged that additional monetary
accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless
incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable
strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery,” according
to the record of the Federal Open Market Committee’s July 31-
Aug. 1 gathering released today in Washington.  The S&P 500 has rebounded as much as 12 percent from a
five-month low in June and yesterday climbed to its highest
level in four years before erasing gains and ending the session
lower.  The rally has been driven by Europe’s efforts to fight its
debt crisis, better-than-forecast economic data and speculation
that central banks will provide more stimulus if needed to
safeguard the global recovery.  Earlier declines in stocks today were triggered after a
slump in  Japan ’s exports spurred concern about global demand.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
