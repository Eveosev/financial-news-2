Japan’s 10-year yields may stay
below 0.86 percent after forming a so-called dome pattern, said
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , citing trading patterns.  Benchmark yields have fallen four basis points since
peaking at a two-month high of 0.86 percent on Aug. 16 and 17,
completing the dome formation, said Daisuke Uno, chief
strategist in  Tokyo  at a unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui , Japan’s
second-largest bank by market value. Ten-year rates had climbed
from a nine-year low of 0.72 percent marked on July 23.  “Yields reached 0.86 percent, forming the round top,” Uno
said. “The rising trend in rates has stopped.”  Ten-year bond  yields  this week have closed the gap between
the intraday levels on Aug. 15 and 16, a downward move that
signals rates may stay below 0.86 percent in the near term,
according to Uno. Yields were as high as 0.82 percent on Aug. 15
and as low as 0.835 percent on Aug. 16.  Japan’s 10-year yield fell half a basis point to 0.82
percent yesterday, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
