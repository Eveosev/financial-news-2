Tokyo Electric Power Co. found
record high levels of radioactive cesium in fish it caught for
tests within 20 kilometers of the coast from the crippled
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.  The utility detected a combined 25,800 becquerels per
kilogram of cesium 134 and cesium 137 in a greenling caught on
Aug. 1, it  said  yesterday in a statement. That beat the previous
high of 18,700 becquerels per kilogram found in cherry salmon
and is 258 times the level of cesium  Japan ’s government
considers safe for consumption,  Kyodo News  reported.  The government  banned  shipments of fish from waters off
Fukushima since May last year, with the exception of two types
of octopus and one type of shellfish that have shown to be
within cesium safety levels, said Noriyuki Mizobe, a group
manager in the resources and environment research division of
Japan’s Fisheries Agency.  Neighboring Ibaraki and Miyagi prefectures have introduced
voluntary restrictions on certain fish shipments and radiation
testing of catches. Other prefectures, including all bordering
the Pacific coast, are testing fish catches for radiation, he
said.  The Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant released massive amounts of
radioactive substances into the air and the ocean after the
March 11 quake and tsunami last year caused reactor meltdowns.
Fishing and farming industries in the region north of  Tokyo  have
been devastated as consumers shun produce from the areas because
of radiation contamination fears.  To contact the reporter on this story:
