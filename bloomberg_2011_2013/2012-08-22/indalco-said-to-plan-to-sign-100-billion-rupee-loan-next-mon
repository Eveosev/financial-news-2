Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , India’s
second-largest aluminum maker by output, plans to sign an
agreement to borrow 100 billion rupees ($1.8 billion) as early
as next month, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The  interest rate  for the 12 1/2-year term facility, which
will finance the company’s Aditya Alumina and Aluminium project
in the eastern state of Odisha, is about 11.25 percent, one of
the people said, asking not to be identified because the
information is private. The company has raised  60 billion rupees 
selling bonds since January, the person said.  The integrated alumina project includes a 4.2 million ton
bauxite mine, a 1.5 million ton alumina refinery and a 359,000
ton smelter, according to Hindalco’s website. The company has
placed orders for equipment for the smelter and power plant
after receiving most of the clearances required for the project,
it said.  Hindalco spokeswoman Pragnya Ram declined to comment on the
financing when contacted yesterday and couldn’t be reached when
called today.  The loan is being arranged by SBI Capital Markets Ltd. and
 IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI) , one of the people said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
