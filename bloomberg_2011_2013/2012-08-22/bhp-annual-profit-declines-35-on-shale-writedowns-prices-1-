BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, said full-year profit fell 35 percent
after the company was forced to write down the value of shale
gas and nickel assets because of tumbling prices.  Net income  was $15.4 billion for the year ended June 30,
from $23.6 billion a year ago, the Melbourne-based company said
today in a statement. That beat the $14.6 billion average of
eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company
delayed the approval of the expansion of the Olympic Dam copper
and uranium project in  Australia , saying it will seek a lower
cost solution.  BHP joins  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  in booking
declining profits as they battle the dual headwinds of falling
commodity prices and rising costs amid sluggish global growth.
The $3.3 billion in writedowns this month prompted Chief
Executive Office Marius Kloppers to waive his annual bonus.  “BHP and Rio are really suffering from earning stagnation
or contraction as the fall in prices is greater than the
increase in their output,” Grant Craighead, the Sydney-based
managing director of Stock Resources, said in a phone interview
before the results. “It’s clear they’re going into a phase of
more cautious funding of growth projects.”  BHP, the third-biggest iron ore exporter, dropped 0.2
percent to A$33.21 at 3:47 p.m. Sydney time. The company will
pay a final dividend of 57 cents a share, up from 55 cents a
year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
