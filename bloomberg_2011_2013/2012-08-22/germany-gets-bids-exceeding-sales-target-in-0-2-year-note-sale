Germany  got  bids  for 6.24 billion
euros ($7.78 billion) of two-year notes at an auction today,
 exceeding  its 5 billion-euro maximum sales target, according to
a statement from the Bundesbank.  The nation sold the securities due in September 2014 at an
average yield of zero percent, compared with minus 0.06 percent
at an auction of similar-dated debt on July 18. German bonds had
declined on the previous two days, pushing two-year yields above
zero for the first time in five weeks, amid speculation European
leaders are making progress in solving the region’s debt crisis.  “You could argue on a very cheeky scale that this may even
be a bargain to catch it at zero,” said  David Schnautz , a
fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  New York . “There
are a lot of hopes, but there’s also a lot of disappointment
potential. For all those who still seek a very safe parking lot
for their money, buying the two-year German paper at nothing is
actually still a valid trade.”  The yield on the previously issued German note due in June
2014 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to minus
0.006 percent at 5 p.m. London time. The yield climbed as high
as 0.02 percent yesterday after being negative since July 12.  A negative yield means investors who hold the security
until it matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
