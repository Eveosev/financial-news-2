Twenty people charged with producing
and selling recycled oil from kitchen waste stood trial today in
Zhejiang province, eastern  China , the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.  The suspects have been charged with manufacturing and
selling fake and substandard products, and toxic and hazardous
food, according to Xinhua, which cited a written statement by
the Intermediate People’s Court in Ningbo.  There was no verdict at the hearing, Xinhua said.  China’s Ministry of Public Security intensified a crackdown
on illegal workshops that produce the so-called gutter oil in
April, according to the Xinhua story. The material, which is
extracted from kitchen waste dredged from the gutters behind
restaurants, has been deemed unsafe for consumption as it may
contain carcinogens, Xinhua said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
