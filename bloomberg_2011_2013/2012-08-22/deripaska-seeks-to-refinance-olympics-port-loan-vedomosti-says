Russian billionaire  Oleg Deripaska ’s
Basic Element is seeking to restructure a 3 billion-ruble ($94
million) loan from Vnesheconombank, Vedomosti  said , citing
unidentified bank and company officials.  The state-run  development bank  known as VEB issued the loan
for construction of a port in the Sochi region for the 2014
Winter Olympics, which has handled only about 25 percent to 30
percent of planned volumes, the newspaper said.  If VEB doesn’t agree to restructure the loan, Deripaska’s
company may face a technical default, Vedomosti said, citing a
government official involved in preparations for the Olympics.  Basic Element’s press office confirmed the company has
applied to restructure the debt and declined to comment further
when called by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
