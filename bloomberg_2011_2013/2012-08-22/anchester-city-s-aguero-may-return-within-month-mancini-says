Manchester City striker  Sergio Aguero  is expected to return to action within a month after
injuring his knee against Southampton three days ago.  Aguero fell awkwardly during City’s 3-2 season-opening win
and the club initially feared he may be lost for the season. A
scan revealed no major damage and manager  Roberto Mancini  said
he hoped the 24-year-old could be ready for the defending
Premier League champion’s visit to Stoke on Sept. 15.  “I don’t think Sergio will be out for long and we are
hoping he will be back after the international break, which
obviously is fantastic news for him and us,” Mancini said on
City’s website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
