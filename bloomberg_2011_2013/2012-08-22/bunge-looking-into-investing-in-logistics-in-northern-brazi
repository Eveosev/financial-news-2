  Bunge Ltd. (BG) , the world’s second-
largest oilseed processor, is looking into expanding its
logistics assets in northern Brazil, the new “agricultural
frontier,” Pedro Parente, the company’s country head, said.  “We are paying a whole lot of attention to this,” Parente
said today in Sao Paulo. He declined to give details on timing
or amount of the investments.  Bunge owns 11 terminals in eight ports in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
