Japanese  stocks  declined after the
nation reported a wider-than-expected trade deficit in July as
Europe’s debt crisis damped demand. Trade volume was low ahead
of a euro-area finance ministers meeting this week to discuss a
bailout package for Greece.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an electronics maker that gets almost 20
percent of its sales in Europe, lost 1.2 percent. Nippon Steel
Corp. paced declines in the sector after iron-ore prices fell to
a 32-month low amid falling demand from China. Inpex Corp.,
Japan’s top oil explorer by market value, rose after agreeing to
acquire a stake in an oil block in Angola.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.5 percent to 9,112.85
as of 9:35 a.m. in  Tokyo . Volume on the gauge was more than 20
percent below the 30-day average as investors await developments
from a euro-area finance ministers meeting. The broader Topix
Index lost 0.4 percent to 762.53, with more than twice as many
shares declining as advancing.  -- With assistance from Andy Sharp in Tokyo. Editor:  Jim Powell   To contact the reporter on this story:
