Russia  won’t sell grains from state
stockpiles before November, when the government may discuss
whether such a measure is necessary, Interfax said, citing an
Agriculture Ministry document.  Selling grains from state inventories before completion of
harvesting in November may push down domestic prices and
farmers’ revenues, according to the document cited by Interfax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
