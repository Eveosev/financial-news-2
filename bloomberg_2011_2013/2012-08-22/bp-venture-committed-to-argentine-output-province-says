BP Plc’s (BP/)   Pan American  Energy LLC
joint venture in Argentina is committed to maintaining output at
the Cerro Dragon field, a provincial official said.  Pan American will reduce output at the field to about
14,500 cubic meters (91,202 barrels) of crude per day, down 10
percent from average production before a strike that ended last
month, Chubut Province Oil Minister Ezequiel Cufre said.
Newspaper La Nacion reported today that the company was halting
output at the field.  “They’re committed to maintaining production,” Cufre said
in a telephone interview from the southern city of Comodoro
Rivadavia, citing a meeting yesterday with Pan American Chief
Executive Officer Martin Prieto. Shareholder Carlos Bulgheroni
was also at the meeting yesterday, he said  Cerro Dragon, Argentina’s largest oil field, resumed output
on July 12 after a three-week workers strike. Pan American will
stop 18 out 51 pieces of equipment at the field for maintenance
following the strike and some workers will be put on paid leave,
Cufre said.  Pan American didn’t respond to e-mails and calls seeking
comment.  BP owns 60 percent of Pan American, which operates Cerro
Dragon. Bridas Corp., a joint venture between China’s  Cnooc Ltd. (883) 
and Argentina’s Bulgheroni family, owns the other 40 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
