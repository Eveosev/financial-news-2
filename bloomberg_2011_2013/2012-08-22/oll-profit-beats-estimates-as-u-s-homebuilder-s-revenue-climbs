Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, rose to a five-year high after reporting a
 better-than-estimated  profit and an increase in revenue for the
fiscal third-quarter.  Net income was $61.6 million, or 36 cents a share, for the
three months ended July 31, compared with $42.1 million, or 25
cents, a year earlier, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company
said today in a statement. The average  estimate  of 18 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey was for earnings of 18 cents a share. The
year-earlier results included a $38.2 million tax benefit.  “Top to bottom, this result was easily the best we’ve seen
in the industry this quarter,” Stephen East, an analyst with
International Strategy & Investment Group LLC in Saint Charles,
 Missouri , wrote in a note today. “The luxury market has been
one of the best, if not the best segment in housing.”  Toll rose 3.8 percent to $33.01 at the close in  New York ,
the highest since Feb. 16, 2007. The 11-member Standard & Poor’s
1500 Homebuilding index gained 3.1 percent.  The U.S. new-home market is beginning to recover as
historically low  mortgage  rates and a tight  inventory  of
existing houses push more people to consider buying from
builders. The improvement is enabling homeowners to sell starter
houses and move up to larger properties, such as those offered
by Toll, which caters to customers with better access to cash
and credit than first-time buyers usually have.  ‘Pricing Power’  “The housing recovery is being driven by pent-up demand,
very low  interest rates  and attractively priced homes,” Chief
Executive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr. said during a conference
call with investors. “With an industry-wide shortage of
inventory in many markets, we are enjoying some pricing power.”  Revenue rose to $554.3 million in the quarter from $394.3
million a year earlier, Toll said. Pretax income increased more
than 10-fold to $43 million. The company completed 963 home
sales, a 39 percent increase.  The average price of the homes Toll delivered in the third
quarter increased to $576,000 from $557,000 in the previous
three months. The gross margin, which excludes interest and
writedowns, widened to 24.4 percent from 23.4 percent a year
earlier.  Land Spending  Toll Brothers spent $189 million on land during the
quarter, including $110 million for a joint venture with Shea
Homes LP in Orange County,  California . In June, it won a
competition to team with Starwood Capital Group LLC on a hotel-
condominium development near the Brooklyn Bridge in New York.  The company was able to raise prices at about half of its
selling communities, with the biggest increases at its New York
City-area high-rises, Yearley said. Sales and pricing are
strengthening in  Texas , California,  Seattle  and parts of  Florida 
in addition to Toll’s Atlantic Coast concentration from  Boston 
to  Washington , he said.  “Chicago was a nightmare,” Executive Chairman Bob Toll
said during the conference call. “It’s dead as a doornail.”  U.S. housing construction permits in July rose to an annual
pace of 812,000, the most since 2008, the Commerce Department
reported Aug. 16. Orders for 13 publicly traded homebuilders
increased to 29,362 in the second quarter, up 17 percent from a
year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
Industries.  Sales of  previously owned homes  rose to an annual pace of
4.47 million last month, up from 4.37 million in June, the
National Association of Realtors reported today.  The Commerce Department releases July new-home sales data
tomorrow. Sales probably rose to an annual pace of 365,000, the
median of 72 estimates in a Bloomberg survey, from 350,000 in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
