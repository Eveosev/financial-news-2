Kevin Youkilis  hit a grand slam and
Paul Konerko added his 21st homer of the season as the Chicago
White Sox defeated the New York Yankees 7-3 in a battle of Major
League Baseball division leaders.  The Yankees jumped out to a lead for the second straight
night, only to have the White Sox rally for the win. New York,
which led 3-0 two nights ago before losing 9-6 at Chicago, had a
2-0 first-inning lead last night.  Derek Jeter led off the game with a home run for the
Yankees (72-51), who also got a solo homer from  Russell Martin 
in the seventh inning. The loss kept New Yorkâ€™s lead in the
American League East division at four games over the Tampa Bay
Rays, who lost 1-0 to Kansas City in 10 innings.  The White Sox (67-55) lead the AL Central by two games over
the Detroit Tigers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
