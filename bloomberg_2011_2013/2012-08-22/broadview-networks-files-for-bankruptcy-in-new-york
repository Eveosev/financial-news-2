Broadview Networks Inc., a provider
of phone, Internet and data services for businesses, sought
 bankruptcy protection  from creditors.  The company, based in  New York , listed debt and assets of
as much as $500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed today in
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in  Manhattan .  Broadview listed its largest equity holders as MCG Capital
Corp., with 51 percent of the common stock of Broadview Networks
Holdings, and Baker Communications Fund LP with 15 percent of
that stock, as well as shares of its preferred stock.  Broadview Networks announced July 13 that it had reached an
agreement with some creditors for a financial restructuring plan
which will exchange the company’s $300 million in senior secured
notes for new five-year notes and equity in the company.  The restructuring agreement garnered support from a group
of investors controlling about two-thirds of the outstanding
notes, in addition to holders of about 70 percent of the
preferred stock, according to a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The 11.375 percent senior secured notes
mature on Sept. 1.  Broadview Network Holdings Inc., Broadview Networks’s
parent company, reported a $5.3 million net loss on revenue of
$88.5 million for the quarter ended March 31. The balance sheet
showed total assets of $258.3 million and total liabilities of
$373.4 million. Revenue fell to $378.2 million in 2011 from
$407.7 million the previous year.  Broadview Network Holdings, through affiliates, has about
36,000 business customers in the U.S., according to its  website .
The company said July 13 it hired Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP
as restructuring counsel and Evercore Group LLC as its financial
adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
