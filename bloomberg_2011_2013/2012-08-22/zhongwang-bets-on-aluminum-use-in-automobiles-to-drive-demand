China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd. (1333) ,
Asia’s largest maker of extruded aluminum products, said demand
is increasing as carmakers use more of the lightweight metal in
place of steel.  “Aluminum usage in cars has changed noticeably in the past
year,” Executive Director Lu Changqing said in an interview in
Hong Kong. “Growth will be driven by the transportation
sector.”  Aluminum producers globally are betting regulation to cut
carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency in the U.S. and
Europe will prompt carmakers to use more aluminum. Jaguar Land
Rover plans to start selling its first all-aluminum Range Rover
SUV next month, reducing the car’s weight by 39 percent, while
Daimler AG’s Mercedes is using the metal for its 93,534-euro
($116,599) SL model.  China ’s industrial aluminum extrusion market will expand at
least 12 percent this year to 4 million metric tons, Lu said.
Liaoning-based Zhongwang today announced first-half profit more
than doubled after it shifted its focus to the domestic market.  China Zhongwang  shares  gained as much as 7.9 percent to
HK$3.28 and traded at HK$3.23 as of 1:26 p.m. in Hong Kong. The
shares have gained 21 percent this year, compared with an 8.2
percent increase in the benchmark  Hang Seng  index.  Net income climbed to 1.03 billion  yuan  ($162.1 million) in
the six months ended June 30, according to a statement filed to
the Hong Kong stock exchange. Revenue increased 61 percent to
6.88 billion yuan.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, reported
last month second-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates
as carmakers bought more aluminum. Alcoa expects 2 percent to 7
percent growth in the automotive market in China this year,
Chief Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  said July 10 on a
conference call, according to a copy of the transcript.  To contact the reporter on this story:
