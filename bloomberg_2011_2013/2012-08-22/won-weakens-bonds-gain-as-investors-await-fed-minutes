South Korea ’s won retreated from a
one-week high before a Federal Reserve report that may influence
expectations for further monetary stimulus in the world’s
biggest economy.  Government bonds  were little changed.  The Fed releases minutes today of its July 31-Aug. 1 policy
meeting, having said at the time it would provide additional
accommodation as needed. The central bank refrained from
signaling imminent plans for a third round of asset purchases
that may spur capital inflows into emerging-market assets.
Overseas investors  bought  more Korean equities than they sold on
all but one day this month, boosting their holdings by $4.5
billion, exchange data show.  “The won extended losses near market closure as some
investors covered their short positions on the dollar,” said
Lee Jung Hyun, a Seoul-based currency trader for  Industrial Bank
of Korea. (024110)  “South Korean importers bought the dollar to settle
bills, and the Fed’s minutes released today may make the market
volatile.” A short position is a bet an asset will decline.  The won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,135.90 per dollar in
Seoul, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It touched 1,130.80
earlier, the strongest level since Aug. 14. One-month implied
volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage
point, to 7.34 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 was steady at 2.91 percent,  Korea  Exchange Inc. prices
show. Three-year debt futures slid 0.01 to 105.79 and the one-
year interest-rate swap climbed one basis point to 2.94 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
