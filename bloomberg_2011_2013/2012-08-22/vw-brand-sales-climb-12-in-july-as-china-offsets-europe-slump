Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s biggest
carmaker, said sales at its namesake brand rose 12 percent in
July as stronger demand in China made up for a decline in
western Europe.  VW-brand deliveries increased to 468,300 cars and sport-
utility vehicles from 418,600 autos a year earlier, the
Wolfsburg, Germany-based manufacturer said today in a statement.
Seven-month sales rose 10 percent to 3.26 million vehicles,
accelerating from a 9.5 percent first-half gain.  “The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand has grown global
deliveries further, despite the continued difficult market
situation, above all in western Europe,” Christian Klingler,
the company’s sales chief, said in the statement.  The VW brand has offset a contraction in western European
economies by expanding in the U.S. and China while volume
manufacturers that are more dependent on the region, such as  PSA
Peugeot Citroen (UG)  and  Fiat SpA (F) , eliminate jobs and cut capacity.
Car sales in the European Union are forecast to drop 7 percent
this year to 12.2 million vehicles, according to the  ACEA  auto-
industry group.  In the first seven months of 2012, VW’s sales in western
Europe, excluding  Germany , fell 5 percent to 528,200 vehicles.
The brand’s deliveries rose 2.5 percent to 361,400 cars and SUVs
in its home country in the period.  Demand for VW vehicles in China rose 15 percent to 1.14
million vehicles through July. The brand’s U.S. sales surged 34
percent to 245,700 autos.  A new generation of the Golf hatchback is scheduled to be
unveiled on Sept. 4 and enter showrooms in the fourth quarter.
The compact accounted for 17 percent of VW-brand  sales  in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
