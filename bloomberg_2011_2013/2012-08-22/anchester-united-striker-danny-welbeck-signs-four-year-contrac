Manchester United striker  Danny Welbeck  signed a new four-year contract with the 19-time English
soccer champion.  Welbeck’s agreement runs through June 2016, the Premier
League club said on its  website . The 21-year-old  England 
national team player has 17 goals in 64 appearances for United
since 2008.  “Danny has been with the club since he was eight years old
and has made fantastic progress in the last couple of years,
first out on loan and last year as a regular in the first
team,” United manager  Alex Ferguson  said. “This year is
another important one for him. He has a bright future.”  Welbeck scored 12 goals in 39 games last season after
spending the 2010-11 campaign on loan at Sunderland. His new
deal comes five days after United signed  Robin van Persie  from
Arsenal on a four-year contract.  “Playing for United is all I’ve ever wanted to do, it’s
the club I’ve supported all my life,” he said. “I can’t wait
for the challenge of the new season to play my part in helping
the team compete for trophies.”  Welbeck has made nine appearances for England since
debuting in 2011, scoring twice. He started all four games at
this year’s European Championship and had the winning goal in a
3-2 defeat of Sweden in the group stage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
