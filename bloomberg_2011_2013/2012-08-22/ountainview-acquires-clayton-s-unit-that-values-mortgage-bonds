MountainView Capital Holdings LLC,
the capital-markets firm specializing in mortgage assets such as
servicing rights, has acquired a unit of  Clayton Holdings LLC 
used by investors to value securities including home-loan bonds.  The deal closed on Aug. 15, Denver-based MountainView said
today in an e-mailed  statement , without disclosing the terms.  The unit, which also offers pricing for commercial-mortgage
bonds, asset-backed securities, home loans and credit-default
swaps, has been in business for eight years with more than 60
clients, Mark Garland, president of MountainView Analytics, said
in the statement. The two firms formed a partnership in which
each will sell the services of the other.  MountainView also said it hired Andrew Platt as head of
business development. Platt previously served as a managing
director and head of specialty finance in the financial
institutions group at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, and has worked at
UBS AG, Bank of America Corp. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Clayton was the largest provider of due diligence on
mortgages packaged into bonds during the U.S. housing boom.
Along with home-loan reviews, the Shelton, Connecticut-based
company offers other services tied to U.S. residential and
commercial mortgages to investors, banks and regulators. It was
bought in 2008 by a Greenfield Partners LLC fund for about $140
million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
