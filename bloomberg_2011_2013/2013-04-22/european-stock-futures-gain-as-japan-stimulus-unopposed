European stocks  rose, rebounding
from the biggest weekly drop in five months, as  Italy  elected a
president and the Group of 20 refrained from opposing the Bank
of Japan’s stimulus policies.  UniCredit SpA climbed 2.7 percent as Italy’s two-year bond
yield declined to a record low.  Delhaize (DELB)  Group SA surged to a
17-month high as the Belgian retailer’s profit beat estimates.
 Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA)  slid for a seventh day after
earnings missed projections.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  advanced 0.2 percent to 285.68
at the close of trading. The benchmark gauge pared an earlier
gain of as much as 0.9 percent as U.S. home sales unexpectedly
fell. The measure retreated 2.5 percent last week as economic
data from the U.S. to  China  missed forecasts. It has still risen
2.2 percent this year.  “There’s some relief since the worst case was avoided in
Italy, but political stability is still wishful thinking,” said
Witold Bahrke, who helps oversee $55 billion as senior
strategist at PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen. “When  Europe 
suffers and Asia weakens, markets hope that the U.S. will keep
the global economy afloat, therefore these U.S. macro data are
increasingly in focus. Longer term the U.S. housing market is
still a bright spot, but short term it cannot defy gravity.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in 11 of the 18 western
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX rose 0.2 percent, while Italy’s
 FTSE MIB Index (FTSEMIB)  rallied 1.7 percent to a one-month high. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.1 percent. The volume of shares
changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies was 8.8 percent less than
the 30-day average, according to Bloomberg data.  Yield Record  Italian bonds advanced, pushing the yield on the two-year
notes to as little as 1.208 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg
began compiling the data in 1993.  Giorgio Napolitano was elected to a second term as Italy’s
president after accepting a last-minute appeal from party
leaders to run again. The 87-year-old incumbent won the backing
of parties led by former premier Silvio Berlusconi, caretaker
Prime Minister Mario Monti and outgoing Democratic Party leader
Pier Luigi Bersani.  His re-election came after the country’s divided Parliament
failed to agree on a candidate in the first five rounds of
voting, an impasse that led Bersani to resign. Italy has yet to
form a new government eight weeks after inconclusive elections.  Bank of  Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda emerged from last
week’s G-20 meeting saying he was emboldened to press on with
the campaign to defeat deflation. The central bank meets this
week after pledging April 4 to double the monetary base.  House Sales  In the U.S.,  purchases  of previously owned houses fell 0.6
percent to a 4.92 million annual rate last month, figures from
the National Association of Realtors showed. The median forecast
of 75 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected sales would
increase to a 5 million rate.  UniCredit, Italy’s largest lender, gained 2.7 percent to
3.73 euros. Banco Popolare SC, the fourth-biggest bank by
assets, rose 4.5 percent to 1.10 euros. Mediobanca SpA, the
nation’s largest publicly traded investment bank, added 2
percent to 4.67 euros.  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) , Italy’s biggest insurer, added
5.2 percent to 13.48 euros, the highest price since Feb. 1. The
stock was upgraded to overweight, a rating similar to buy, from
equal weight at Barclays Plc, which said the company may raise
its dividend this year.  Delhaize Rallies  Delhaize soared 11 percent to 47.16 euros, the highest
since November 2011. First-quarter operating profit before one-
time items rose 13 percent to 214 million euros ($279 million),
the Brussels-based company said. Analysts had projected a
decline to 175 million euros, according to the average of 17
estimates published on its website. Comparable sales in the U.S.
gained 1.9 percent, the most in six quarters.  SMA Solar Technology AG, Germany’s biggest solar-energy
company by market value, surged 4.7 percent to 18.32 euros after
 ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  agreed to buy U.S. peer Power-One Inc. for about $1
billion. Meyer Burger Technology AG, which supplies machinery to
solar-panel makers, advanced 3.7 percent to 7.37 Swiss francs.  Randgold Resources Ltd., a miner of the precious metal in
 Africa , jumped 4.4 percent to 4,870 pence as gold prices
increased for a fifth day.  Philips slid 5.2 percent to 20.54 euros, the biggest drop
since May 2012. First-quarter earnings before interest, taxes,
amortization and one-time items were 421 million euros, the
world’s largest lighting manufacturer said, missing estimates of
441 million euros. Sales dropped 0.9 percent to 5.26 billion
euros, trailing the 5.48 billion-euro analyst projection.  Watchmakers Fall  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier

biggest maker of Swiss watches, dropped 1.4 percent to 511.50
francs. French peer Hermes International SCA said in a statement
that watch sales declined 5.3 percent as the Chinese market
slowed at the start of the year.  Still, Hermes added 1.1 percent to 251.55 euros as the
maker of Kelly handbags said overall sales rose 10 percent to
856.8 million euros, beating the average analyst estimate of 854
million euros.  Paddy Power Plc (PWL) , Ireland’s largest bookmaker, sank 5.7
percent to 61.50 euros in Dublin trading, the biggest drop since
July 2011. Davy cut its rating on the stock to underperform from
outperform, citing concerns over the company’s entry into the
“faltering” Italian market and its exposure to the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
