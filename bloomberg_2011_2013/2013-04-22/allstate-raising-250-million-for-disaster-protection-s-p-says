Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the home and auto
insurer that had $359 million of first-quarter costs from
catastrophes, plans to obtain $250 million of protection with
bonds designed to guard against losses linked to earthquakes and
hurricanes, according to  Standard & Poor’s .  The firm will buy protection from Sanders Re Ltd., a
Bermuda-based special-purpose reinsurance company that plans to
issue $100 million of Class A bonds and $150 million of Class B
securities due in four years, S&P analysts led by Gary Martucci
wrote in an April 19 report. The so-called catastrophe bonds
will cover losses linked to hurricanes in states from  Alabama  to
New York as well as earthquake damage in California.  Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman at Northbrook, Illinois-
based Allstate, didn’t immediately respond to a request for
comment on the reinsurance premium the company will pay. The
Class A securities will probably be rated BB+(sf), one level
below investment-grade, with the Class B notes probably
receiving a grade of BB(sf), S&P said.  Similarly rated corporate bonds in the U.S. due in about
four years yielded 4.1 percent last week, down from 5.66 percent
a year ago, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. Dollar-denominated catastrophe bonds have  returned  4.37
percent this year, exceeding the 3.61 percent delivered by
corporate junk debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
