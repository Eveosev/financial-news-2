Zimbabwe’s government is preparing
a law that would allow it to seize controlling stakes in
companies without compensation, according to a draft of the
legislation obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The law would be an amendment to a 2007 act that compels
foreign and white-owned companies such as  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) ,
Sinosteel Corp. and  Impala Platinum Holding Ltd. (IMP)  to sell or cede
51 percent of their shares to black nationals or state-approved
agencies.  “The motivation for this position arises out of the desire
to ensure that the people of Zimbabwe benefit fully, and without
cost whatsoever, from enterprises that exploit their God-given
natural resources,” according to the draft law.  Zimbabwe, which has the world’s second-biggest platinum and
chrome reserves, endorsed a new constitution in a referendum
last month, paving the way for elections, which must be held
before Oct. 31.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  and Impala have agreed to cede
stakes in their local units. The government is in talks with
banks including  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  about
their compliance with the current local ownership law.  To contact the reporters on this story:
