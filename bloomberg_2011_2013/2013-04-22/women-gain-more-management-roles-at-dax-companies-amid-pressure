The amount of women in management
positions at German companies in the benchmark  DAX index  rose by
1.3 percentage points between 2010 and 2012 as political
pressure to promote women increased.  The companies in the index reported on average that women
filled 19.1 percent of leadership roles last year, according to
calculations based on figures in a joint statement from the 30
DAX members.  Deutsche Bank AG,  Fresenius Medical Care (FME)  AG and Henkel AG
topped the list, with 31 percent of leadership jobs held by
women at each company. The proportion at Fresenius declined from
32 percent in 2010 however.  The DAX members set their own individual binding targets in
October 2011 and publish their results annually, reacting to
political pressure and calls for mandatory quotas. German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic-led bloc reached
a compromise last week setting a binding quota of 30 percent
from 2020 on board memberships.  Opposition parties had sought to force large companies to
reserve as many as 20 percent of board seats for women from this
year, rising to 40 percent from 2018.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  and  Continental AG (CON)  lag their peers in
the DAX with women holding 9 percent and 8 percent of leadership
roles respectively.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , Germany’s largest
steelmaker, didn’t report how many women occupied leadership
positions globally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
