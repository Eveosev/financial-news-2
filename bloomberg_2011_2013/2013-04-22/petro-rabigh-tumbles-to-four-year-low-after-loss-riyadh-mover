Rabigh Refining & Petrochemicals
Co. (PETROR)  plunged to the lowest level in more than four years after
posting its biggest quarterly loss since 2009 and saying results
in the current period could also be hurt by maintenance work.  The  shares  slumped 9.9 percent to 16.45 riyals, the lowest
level since March 2009, at 2:13 p.m. in  Riyadh  as trading
volumes were more than three times the three-month daily
average. The stock was the biggest decliner on Saudi Arabia’s
benchmark Tadawul All Share Index, which gained 0.3 percent.  Petro Rabigh, as the company is known, had a first-quarter
loss of 658.1 million riyals ($175 million) after a profit a
year earlier as power outages and scheduled maintenance reduced
sales. That was the biggest loss since the three months ending
September 2009. The venture between Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and
 Sumitomo Chemical Co. (4005)  said maintenance work, starting today and
lasting until May 3, is also “expected to have an impact” on
second-quarter results.  “The outlook for the year does not look very promising
given the company has announced another shutdown,” Muhammad Faisal Potrik, an analyst at Riyad Capital, said in an e-mailed
response to questions. First-quarter results were
“disappointing” and Riyad Capital is in the process of
lowering its rating on the stock, he said.  Petro Rabigh shares have declined 6.3 percent this year,
compared with an increase of 4.7 percent for the Tadawul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
