Janice Eberly, the U.S. Treasury’s
chief economist, is leaving the department this week.  Eberly will return to her faculty job at Northwestern
University’s Kellogg School of Management, Treasury spokeswoman
Sabrina Siddiqui said in an e-mail today.  Eberly, 50, was confirmed by the Senate as assistant
secretary for economic policy in October 2011 and has led the
Treasury office responsible for analyzing U.S. and global
economic developments. She replaced Alan Krueger, who is now
chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.  At Northwestern, in Evanston,  Illinois , Eberly is a finance
professor and former head of the finance department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
