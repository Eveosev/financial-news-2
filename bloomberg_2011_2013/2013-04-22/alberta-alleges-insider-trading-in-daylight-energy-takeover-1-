Daylight Energy Ltd. Chief
Executive Officer Anthony Lambert violated insider trading laws
by buying shares in his company before its purchase by Sinopec
International Petroleum Exploration & Production Corp., staff of
the Alberta Securities Commission said in a notice.  Lambert also told his ex-wife about the proposed takeover,
according to an e-mailed statement today from the commission.
Lambert, his ex-wife and her boyfriend all bought shares in
September 2011, prior to the public announcement of the takeover
the next month.  Lambert denies the allegations and plans to contest,
according to a statement e-mailed by the company’s spokesman
Alan Bayless.  “I complied with Daylight’s corporate trading policies in
every respect, and made stringent efforts to ascertain that all
trades were permissible in advance,” Lambert said in the
statement.  China Petrochemical Corp., the Beijing-based company known
as Sinopec Group, acquired Daylight Energy for about C$2.2
billion ($2.14 billion) in December 2011 and renamed the
Canadian company Sinopec Daylight Energy Ltd. Lambert remains
CEO of the Canadian company, Bayless said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
