India ’s 10-year bonds rose, pushing
the yield to the lowest level since July 2010, on speculation
easing inflation makes interest-rate reductions more likely.  Wholesale prices rose 5.96 percent in March, the least
since November 2009 and below the central bank’s 6.8 percent
projection, official data showed last week. Brent crude fell 9
percent this month, while gold declined 10.2 percent. The recent
drop in commodity prices has raised the prospect of immediate
monetary easing, said J. Moses Harding, executive vice president
at  IndusInd Bank Ltd. (IIB)  in Mumbai.  “With the softening of inflation, the central bank will
now focus on growth,” he said. “I expect the repurchase rate
to be cut by 50 basis points by the end of June.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, from April 18 to
7.75 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The securities advanced for a sixth day, the longest
winning streak since January. Financial markets were closed on
April 19 for a public holiday.  The Reserve Bank of India has lowered the repurchase  rate 
by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent this year and will next review
policy on May 3. The nation’s gross domestic  product  rose 5
percent in the fiscal year ended March 31, the weakest pace
since 2003, the statistics agency estimates.  Easing inflation “increases the probability of more
accommodative monetary policy,” Raghuram Rajan, the top adviser
in the Finance Ministry, said in an April 16 interview.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.26 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
