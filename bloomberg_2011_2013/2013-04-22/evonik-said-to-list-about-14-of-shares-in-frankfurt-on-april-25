Evonik Industries AG, the German
chemical maker that has failed in three initial public offering
attempts, will list shares in  Frankfurt  on April 25, two people
familiar with the matter said.  Evonik, which has already sold a 12 percent stake to
institutional investors, may sell an extra 2 percent as well as
an overallotment allocation of 0.3 percent, bringing the amount
of freely traded stock to as much as 14.3 percent, said the
people. They asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t
public.  The private placement will count as traded equity and the
price for the additional shares to be released into the market
will be set by demand. The share sales to institutional
investors valued Evonik at about 14 billion euros ($18.3
billion), a person familiar with the matter said last month. The
chemical maker, owned by RAG-Stiftung and CVC Capital Partners
private-equity firm, is a candidate to join  Germany ’s benchmark
 DAX Index (DAX)  when enough shares are freely traded.  Evonik, based in Essen, hired Deutsche Bank AG and
MainFirst Bank AG to advise on the share listing. One of
Evonik’s new owners is Temasek Holdings Pte.,  Singapore ’s state-
owned investment company, which bought a 4.6 percent stake in
March.  Barbara Mueller, a spokeswoman in Essen for Evonik and RAG-
Stiftung, declined to comment on any listing timing. The planned
April 25 listing was earlier reported by Reuters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
