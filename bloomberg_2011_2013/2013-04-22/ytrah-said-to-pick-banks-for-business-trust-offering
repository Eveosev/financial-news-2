Mytrah Energy Ltd. (MYT) ,  India ’s third-
largest wind farm developer, picked Morgan Stanley and Standard
Chartered Plc to manage the Singapore initial public offering of
some of its assets, two people with knowledge of the matter
said.  Mytrah, whose  investors  include Henderson Global Investors
Ltd., may raise about S$500 million ($404 million) by listing
the assets as a business trust, the people said, asking not to
be identified as the process is private. The IPO may take place
in the second half of 2013, they said.  Hyderabad-based Mytrah, which is already listed on the
Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange, said
this month it is studying a Singapore offering to pay debt and
expand. Besides using proceeds to repay long-term and mezzanine
debt, Mytrah said it will also seek to boost its 310 megawatts
of operational wind to more than 600 megawatts this year. Mytrah
plans to reach 5,000 megawatts of wind power by 2018, according
to its  website .  Mytrah, whose shares have risen 20 percent this year in
 London , is the second Indian wind company considering a
Singapore listing. Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services
Ltd., whose shareholders include  Japan ’s Orix Corp. and Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority, is planning an IPO of its wind power
unit in the city-state this year, people with knowledge of the
matter said in September.  Mytrah hasn’t made a final decision on which assets to
include in the business trust IPO, the people said. An outside
spokeswoman for the company couldn’t immediately comment on the
IPO plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
