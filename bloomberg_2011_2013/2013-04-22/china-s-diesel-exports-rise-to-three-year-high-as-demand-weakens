China ’s diesel exports rose to the
highest level in almost three years in March and gasoline
shipments climbed to a one-year high amid the nation’s weakest
domestic oil demand in five months.  Overseas sales of diesel exceeded imports by 394,851 metric
tons, figures e-mailed by the General Administration of Customs
today show. That’s equivalent to 95,800 barrels a day, the most
since July 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net
gasoline exports climbed to 506,110 tons, or about 138,000
barrels a day, the most since March 2012.  China, the world’s second-biggest oil consumer, has curbed
demand for fuel and petrochemicals as its  economy  slows.
Apparent oil consumption, or crude processed plus net refined-
product imports, dropped to 9.77 million barrels a day last
month, the lowest since October, government data show. The
nation’s gross domestic product expanded 7.7 percent in the
first quarter, compared with 7.9 percent in the three months
ended December.  “Oil-product sales are quite sluggish, leading to high
fuel stockpiles,” Liao Kaishun, an analyst with ICIS CI Energy,
a Shanghai-based energy consultant, said by phone. “So refiners
have to ramp up exports to draw down their inventory.”  China’s commercial stockpiles of diesel rose 18 percent to
11.2 million tons in February, the highest level in 10 months, a
report from Xinhua News Agency’s China Oil, Gas & Petrochemicals
newsletter showed March 22. Gasoline supplies dropped 7.8
percent to 6.8 million tons after climbing to the highest in at
least two years in January.  Gas, Crude  Diesel exports  last month rose more than six-fold from a
year ago to 415,931 tons, while  imports  fell 62 percent to
21,080 tons, today’s data show.  Gasoline exports  fell 2.7
percent to 506,116 tons, while imports were at 6 tons.  China’s imports of natural gas through the Central Asia
Pipeline, mostly from  Turkmenistan , rose 22 percent to 1.48
million tons in March while  liquefied natural gas imports  gained
12 percent to 1.26 million tons.  Crude purchases from Iran increased 61 percent from a year
earlier to 1.73 million tons, according to the data. Cargoes
from the Middle Eastern nation were disrupted a year ago because
of a payment dispute between the two nations. Deliveries last
month slid 13 percent from February.  Iran  is under Western sanctions on its energy sales because
of its atomic program. The U.S. State Department on Dec. 7
extended exemptions for 180 days for China and eight other
countries from measures related to the sanctions, saying they
had “continued to significantly reduce” their purchases of the
Islamic republic’s oil.  China exported 106,000 tons of crude to  North Korea  last
month after no shipments in February, the customs data show.
Shipments climbed 8.2 percent from a year earlier. China, which
is North Korea’s closest political ally and biggest trading
partner, will co-operate with the U.S. to persuade the country
to abandon its nuclear pursuits,  Yang Jiechi , China’s foreign
policy chief, said in Beijing this month during a visit by U.S.
Secretary of State  John Kerry .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
