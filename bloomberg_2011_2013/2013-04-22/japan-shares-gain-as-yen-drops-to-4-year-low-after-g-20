Japanese  shares  gained, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average closing at its highest since 2008, as
the yen traded near a four-year low after the Group of 20
nations refrained from opposing  Bank of Japan  stimulus policies.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, gained
1.3 percent. Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. surged 13
percent after the Nikkei newspaper reported the company is in
talks to merge with Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. Bearing maker
JTEKT Corp. jumped 11 percent after saying profit may be
quadruple its forecast. Net One Systems Co. dropped 1.2 percent
after the computer systems’ operator reported preliminary net
income 38 percent below forecast.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.9 percent to close at 13,568.37 in
 Tokyo , its highest since July 2008. The Topix Index added 1.7
percent to 1,145.60. All but two of its 33 industry groups
advanced.  “The stock market is obediently reacting to the weaker yen
after the G-20 approved of  Japan ’s monetary easing measures,”
said Koichi Kurose, chief market strategist at Resona Bank Ltd.
in Tokyo. “Going forward it’s hard to expect much positive
surprise from the Bank of Japan and government, and the pace of
gains may slow down. However, the weaker yen, stronger stocks
trend is likely to continue until mid-May.”  The Topix has climbed 59 percent since mid-November as
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation. The gauge traded
at 1.3 times book value compared with 2.3 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  G-20 Meet  The yen dropped to 99.74 per dollar, near its weakest level
since April 2009. Although the G-20 reiterated a February vow to
avoid “competitive devaluation,” it didn’t single Japan out
for criticism and said the central bank’s plan to double its
monetary base is “intended to stop deflation and support
domestic demand.”  Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda emerged from the
talks saying he was emboldened to press ahead with his campaign
to defeat 15 years of deflation.  Toyota, which gets a quarter of its revenue from  North
America , gained 1.3 percent to 5,550 yen. Honda Motor Co., which
gets about 80 percent of its sales from outside Japan, rose 1.7
percent to 3,915 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s largest camera-
maker, climbed 1.8 percent to 3,780 yen.  The Next Focus  “There were no negative surprises from the G-20 meeting
and it all ended peacefully, leading to a weaker yen and gains
in shares,” said Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee about $33
billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. “The next focus will be
on earnings and whether the weaker yen is helping
manufacturers.”  JTEKT jumped 11 percent to 946 yen, its biggest gain since
March 2011. The company reported net income of 13.5 billion yen
for the previous fiscal year in a preliminary earnings
statement, compared with a forecast of 4 billion yen.  Net One sank 1.2 percent to 828 yen. The company reported
4.3 billion yen in profit for the year ended March 31 in a
preliminary earnings statement, missing its forecast of 6.9
billion yen.  Mitsui Engineering surged 13 percent to post the biggest
gain on the  Nikkei 225 . Kawasaki Heavy fell 0.9 percent,
reversing a gain of as much as 3.6 percent. The companies are
planning to hold merger talks to create Japan’s second-biggest
heavy machinery maker, according to the Nikkei newspaper.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index gained 2.2
percent to 25.79 today, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 7.4 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.
Volume on the measure was 6.2 percent lower than its 30-day
average at the close.  To contact the reporters on this story:
