U.S. equity volatility  rose  the
most in almost four months last week after unexpectedly slow
growth in China and a selloff in commodities triggered the
biggest stock-market drop since November.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index climbed
24 percent to 14.97, the most since December. The index known as
the VIX surged 46 percent in four days, briefly erasing its
year-to-date decline, before sliding 15 percent on the last day
of the week. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which moves in the
opposite direction as the VIX about 80 percent of the time,  slid 
2.1 percent to 1,555.25 for the week.  Stock swings are increasing after the largest slump in gold
futures in more than three decades, weaker corporate earnings
and data from U.S. retail sales to Chinese manufacturing that
trailed economists’ forecasts. Shares outstanding in the most
popular exchange-traded funds linked to the  VIX (VIX)  have reached
all-time highs this month as investors seek to hedge losses in
stocks.  “Volatility is getting more sticky, it rushes up without
going straight back down which we haven’t seen before this
year,” Michael Purves, Greenwich, Connecticut-based Weeden &
Co.’s head of derivatives research, said in a phone interview on
April 19. “The markets are starting to process that the
economic news has been getting softer and that we’re due for a
correction. We obviously also had the extraordinary move in gold
which has been enhancing volatility across asset classes.”  Equity Volatility  The VIX rose 3.2 percent to 15.45 at 9:49 a.m. in New York
today. The S&P 500 has lost 2.4 percent after reaching an all-
time high on April 11. Since 2010, the U.S. equity benchmark has
dropped an average 5.2 percent in the second quarter after
rising in the first.  U.S. stock-market volatility has risen this month as
investors speculate how much longer the  bull market  that began
in 2009 will continue. The average gain or loss for the  S&P 500 
doubled to 0.84 percent from the first quarter and is higher
than 2012’s 0.59 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Options traders have been increasing bets that volatility
would increase. Shares outstanding for the iPath S&P 500 VIX
Short-Term Futures ETN  climbed  to an all-time high of 68.8
million on April 15, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The figure
for the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures reached a  record 
54.6 million shares on April 11. The two had the highest volume
in the past 30 days among volatility-related securities.  ‘Complacent Atmosphere’  “The complacent atmosphere of the equity space is being
challenged by the new order of slower growth as seen in the
Chinese GDP and concerns that Fed financial engineering is
unraveling on some levels,” Greg Richards, who trades VIX and
S&P 500 options as an institutional options broker at Chicago-
based PTR Inc. on the CBOE floor, wrote in e-mail on April 19.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  in March reaffirmed plans
to buy bonds at the current $85 billion monthly pace until the
labor market outlook improves “substantially.” It also pledged
to keep  interest rates  near zero as long as unemployment is
above 6.5 percent and inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.
Unemployment was 7.6 percent last month.  The VVIX Index, a measure of VIX swings, jumped 16 percent
last week to 95.52 for its biggest gain since end of 2012. The
gauge reached its highest level since July on April 18. That
day, the VIX rose as much as 10 percent, briefly erasing its
2013 loss.  There are more outstanding options betting on volatility
gains than losses, with 4.14 million VIX  calls  versus 1.95
million puts as of April 17, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The ratio of calls-to-puts climbed to 3.08-to-1 on April 9, the
highest level since February 2010.  Subdued Swings  Even after last week’s surge, the VIX is still 9 percent
below its average for the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Stock volatility will remain subdued until the Fed pares
its stimulus policy, according to Steve Kilcullen of Nomura
Holdings Inc. in  New York .  “The trading is very defensive, but it has a short
focus,” Kilcullen, head of flow derivatives sales for the
Americas at Nomura, said in an April 19 phone interview.
“Equity volatility won’t go higher until we see policy change
or a reduction of policy effectiveness in the U.S.”  The U.S. job-creation engine sputtered in March as payrolls
grew by 88,000, the smallest gain in nine months, Labor
Department data showed April 5.  China’s Economy  China’s gross domestic product rose 7.7 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on April 15.
That compares with the 8 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of 41 analysts and 7.9 percent in the fourth
quarter. That day, gold futures fell 9.3 percent to $1,361.10 an
ounce, the biggest drop since March 1980.  Profits at S&P 500 companies probably dropped 1.1 percent
in the first three months of the year, the first year-over-year
decrease since 2009, according to forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg. U.S. earnings growth  slowed  last year to a quarterly
average of 4.7 percent, less than one-fifth the rate during 2010
and 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The S&P 500 rallied 12 percent in the first quarter of last
year and slipped 3.3 percent in the second. The previous year,
the index  gained  5.4 percent in the first three months and lost
0.4 percent in the second quarter. The 12 percent slump in the
S&P 500 between April 2010 and June 2010 followed a 4.9 percent
increase in the first quarter.  Investor Expectations  “Investors’ growth expectations were pretty low to start
with as shown by the poor performance of commodities and  China ,
so the events that lead us here do not seem sufficient to create
real panic but post the 2008 trauma, we shouldn’t underestimate
what the markets say,” Olivier Sarfati, head of equity trading
strategies at Citigroup Inc. in New York, said in a phone
interview.  The S&P 500’s 10-day  historical volatility , a measure of
actual price swings, jumped 86 percent over the past week to
20.15 on April 19, its highest level since November.  Among the five most-owned VIX contracts, four were wagers
that volatility would  rise . May 25 calls, with an exercise level
67 percent above the last close, and May 20 calls had the
largest open interest.  “I expect the VIX to be range bound between 12 and 20,”
Philippe Trouve, the VIX options trader and director for equity
derivatives at Bank of America Corp. in New York, said in an
April 19 interview. “It will be volatile within that range
because the macro environment is very binary: inflation or
deflation, more QE or less QE, so the market is struggling with
all these potential outcomes.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
