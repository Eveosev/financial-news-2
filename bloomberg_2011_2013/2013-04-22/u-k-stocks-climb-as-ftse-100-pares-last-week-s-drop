U.K. stocks  closed little changed,
erasing an earlier rally, as mining companies declined with
metal prices and a report showed sales of previously owned U.S.
houses unexpectedly dropped in March.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  led a gauge of commodity producers lower,
tumbling 8.3 percent.  Weir Group Plc (WEIR)  paced losses in engineering
companies as Caterpillar Inc. cut its 2013 forecast.  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  rose.  The FTSE 100 Index slid less than 0.1 percent to 6,280.62
in London. The benchmark gauge lost 1.5 percent last week as
commodities fell amid worse-than-forecast economic data from
China and the U.S. The broader FTSE All-Share Index slipped 0.2
percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.5 percent.  “Concerns about the global macro picture and what has been
reasonably lackluster earnings season continue to weigh on
investors,” said  Henk Potts , who helps oversee $282 billion as
an equity strategist at Barclays Plc in London. “We are still
pretty bullish in the medium to longer term. We have seen an
extraordinary rally and the weakness we have seen recently is a
reminder that markets don’t go up in a straight line.”  Stocks fell as a U.S. report showed sales of previously
owned houses dropped 0.6 percent to a 4.92 million annual rate
in March. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg projected sales would increase to a 5 million rate.  Rating Downgrade  Fitch Ratings  cut the U.K.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA
on April 19, citing weaker economic and fiscal prospects. The
ratings company restored the outlook to stable even as it
predicted that U.K. debt will peak at more than 100 percent of
gross domestic product.  The FTSE 100 earlier rallied as much as 0.9 percent after
Italian President Giorgio Napolitano was re-elected to a second
term, boosting optimism that he will take the lead in trying to
form a new coalition government. The nation’s sovereign bonds
advanced, pushing the two-year note yield to a record low.  Kazakhmys dropped 8.3 percent to 353.6 pence as copper
declined on the London Metal Exchange. The stock soared 24
percent on April 19 after investor  Alexander Machkevitch  said he
may form a group to make an offer for Eurasian Natural Resources
Corp. ENRC declined 2.4 percent to 284.1 pence after surging 27
percent last week.  Engineering Companies  Weir led engineering companies lower, falling 2.7 percent
to 2,074 pence. Melrose Industries Plc dropped 3.3 percent to
236.6 pence and Petrofac Ltd. lost 2.7 percent to 1,267 pence.  Caterpillar, the largest maker of mining equipment, posted
earnings that fell short of estimates and cut its 2013 forecast
and lowered “significantly” its outlook for demand from
commodities producers.  Banks helped limit losses on the FTSE 100. RBS climbed 2
percent to 286.2 pence, Lloyds added 3.5 percent to 49.13 pence
and Barclays rose 1.1 percent to 289.5 pence.  Elsewhere,  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  rallied 4.4 percent to
4,870 pence as gold prices climbed for a fifth day in London
after the biggest slump in three decades boosted physical
purchases. Gold for immediate delivery rose 2.3 percent to
$1,436.60 an ounce, for its longest run of gains since Dec. 27.  Randgold had declined for three-consecutive weeks.  Betfair Group Plc (BET)  jumped 4.2 percent to 838.5 pence, its
highest price since May 3, 2012. The online-gambling company
said it rejected a takeover proposal from  CVC Capital Partners 
at 880 pence per share, saying the offer “fundamentally
undervalues the company.”  Paddy Power Plc (PWL)  dropped 5.7 percent to 61.53 euros in
Dublin trading as J&E Davy Holdings Ltd. downgraded Ireland’s
largest bookmaker for the first time since June 2009, citing
signs that group returns are starting to fall. The stock was cut
to underperform from outperform, meaning investors should sell
the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
