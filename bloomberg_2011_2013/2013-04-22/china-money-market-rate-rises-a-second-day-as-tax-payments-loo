China ’s benchmark money-market rate
rose for a second day on speculation cash supply will wane as
corporate tax payments loom and a public holiday approaches.  Companies need to pay about 400 billion  yuan  ($64.7 billion)
to 500 billion yuan in total annual taxes before the end of this
month, according to Chen Qi, a strategist with UBS Securities Co.
in  Shanghai . Domestic financial markets are closed for three
days from March 29.  “There are expectations for slight tightening in the
money-market rates ahead of the holiday and month-end tax
payments,” Chen said. Still, liquidity is not tight given more
capital inflows from overseas, she added.  The  seven-day repurchase rate  climbed one basis point to
3.12 percent as of 11:05 a.m. in Shanghai, according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost to
receive the seven-day repo, rose two basis points to 3.28
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for 28-day
 repurchase agreements  and seven- and 14-day reverse-repurchase
contracts this morning, according to a trader at a primary
dealer required to bid at the auctions. The two operations would
add or drain funds from the banking system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
