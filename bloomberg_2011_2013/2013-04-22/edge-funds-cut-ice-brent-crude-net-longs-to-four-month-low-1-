(Corrects to say “short” in second paragraph.)  Hedge funds  and other money
managers cut bullish bets on Brent crude by 8,780 contracts in
the week ended April 16, according to data from ICE Futures
Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 108,100 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  To contact  Bloomberg News  for this story:
