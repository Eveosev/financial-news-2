Most Brazilian stocks  fell as
economists cut forecasts for the country’s industrial output
growth this year and next, adding to concern that recovery in
 Latin America ’s largest economy is faltering.  Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado de  Sao Paulo , the
country’s biggest water utility, dropped after Banco Bradesco
SA’s brokerage unit lowered its recommendation to the equivalent
of hold. Retailer  B2W Cia. Global do Varejo  led losses by
companies that sell in the local market.  The Bovespa was  little changed  at 53,956.48 at 10:16 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. Forty-four stocks of the 69 members of the gauge
dropped. The real weakened 0.2 percent to 2.0141 per dollar.
Industrial output will grow 2.86 percent this year, according to
the median forecast among 100 economists surveyed by Brazil’s
central bank. That compares with an estimate of 3 percent a week
earlier. Expansion in 2013 is projected at 3.75 percent, down
from 3.8 percent, the survey showed.  “The central bank survey today confirms a scenario of low
growth for Brazil, with the industrial sector still facing
challenges to speed up the recovery,”  Alvaro Bandeira , a
partner at Orama Asset Management, said by phone from  Rio de
Janeiro .  Sabesp, as Cia. de Saneamento is known, sank 6.2 percent to
86.94 reais. B2W retreated 0.9 percent to 12.93 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
