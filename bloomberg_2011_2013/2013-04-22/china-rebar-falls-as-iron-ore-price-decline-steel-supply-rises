Steel reinforcement-bar futures
fell, extending the biggest weekly decline in two months, amid
rising output from domestic mills and a decline in the price of
 iron ore .  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to 3,665  yuan  ($593) before
trading at 3,678 at 10:12 a.m. local time. Futures lost 4
percent last week, the biggest weekly decline since Feb. 22.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port fell for the fifth day to
$138 a dry ton on April 19, the Steel Index Ltd. data show.
China’s daily crude steel output nationwide in early April was
estimated to have risen 2.5 percent from late-March, Custeel.com
analyst Hu Yanping said on April 18.  “Supply still exceeds demand in the rebar market,” Jiang
Yuying, an analyst at Chengdu Brilliant Futures Co., said by
phone from Shanghai today.  Still, demand for the building material may rise as an
earthquake, measured at magnitude 6.6 by the  U.S. Geological
Survey , hit China’s southwestern Sichuan, killing 188 people,
according to the  China Central Television .  “Demand for the building material may increase from
reconstruction,” Jiang added.  The average  spot price  for rebar dropped 0.5 percent to
3,595 yuan a ton on April 19, according to the Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
