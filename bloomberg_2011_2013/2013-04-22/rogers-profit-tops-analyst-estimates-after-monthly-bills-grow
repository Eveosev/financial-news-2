Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI) ,
 Canada ’s largest wireless operator, fell the most in a year
after adding fewer subscribers in the first quarter than
analysts estimated.  The shares slid 3.2 percent to C$50.40 at the close in
Toronto, the most since April 25, 2012. The drop cut the stock’s
gain this year to 12 percent.  Rogers signed up 32,000 customers to contracts last
quarter, the Toronto-based company said yesterday, missing the
average analyst estimate of 42,000. Sales climbed 2.9 percent to
C$3.03 billion ($2.95 billion), compared with an average
estimate of C$3.06 billion, even after Rogers posted better-
than-expected numbers for average user spending.  Chief Executive Officer Nadir Mohamed, who plans to retire
in January, is seeking to consolidate Rogers’s No. 1 position by
increasing investments in sports programming to sell to
smartphone and tablet users. Rogers has lost market share to  BCE
Inc. (BCE)  and  Telus Corp. (T) , which in recent quarters have added more
of the heavy data-spending customers that the three operators
are vying for.  Profit rose to 80 cents a share, excluding one-time items.
Analysts had predicted 77 cents on average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Average revenue per contract customer -- a key indicator of
how much each subscriber is spending on calls, video and Web
surfing from their mobile device -- climbed C$1.17 to C$68.56
last quarter.  Mohamed teamed up with BCE to buy a controlling stake in
Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd., owner of the  Toronto
Maple Leafs , which are poised to qualify for the National Hockey
League playoffs for the first time in nine years. Mohamed
approved a spending spree to bring top players, including Cy
Young Award winner R.A. Dickey, to the Toronto Blue Jays
baseball team owned by Rogers.  Net income climbed to C$353 million, or 68 cents a share,
from C$305 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
