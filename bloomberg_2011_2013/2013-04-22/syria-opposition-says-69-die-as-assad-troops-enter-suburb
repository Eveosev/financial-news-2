At least 69 people died during six
days of clashes between rebel forces and troops loyal to Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad in a Damascus suburb, the founder of
the opposition Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights  said today.  The dead have been identified by the group and include six
women and three people under 18, Rami  Abdel Rahman  said in an
interview from Coventry,  England . Abdel Rahman said the
Observatory is seeking to identify 11 more bodies.  The casualties occurred as government troops sought to
drive rebels out of the suburb of Jdaidet Al-Fadel, Abdel Rahman
said.  The official SANA news agency said today the troops have
carried out several “operations against terrorists and their
dens” in Jdaidet Al-Fadel and Darayya, inflicting losses and
destroying their weapons. The opposition Local Coordination
Committees said yesterday that government forces killed more
than 450 people in Jdaidet Al-Fadel, mostly women and children.
Reporters cannot reach the area, making it impossible to
reconcile or check the casualty figures.  The uprising against Assad, which began in March 2011, has
killed more than 70,000 people, according to United Nations
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
