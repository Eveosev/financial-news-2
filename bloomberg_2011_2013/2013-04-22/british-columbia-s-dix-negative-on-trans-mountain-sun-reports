The leader of British Columbia’s
opposition New Democratic Party said increased oil-tanker
traffic from  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP) ’s proposed
pipeline expansion is bad for the province, the Vancouver Sun
reported.  Adrian Dix is opposed to Vancouver becoming a “major oil
export port,” as a result of  Kinder Morgan ’s plan to expand its
Trans Mountain oil pipeline from Alberta, the newspaper  quoted
Dix  as saying today. Dix is campaigning to unseat the governing
Liberals.  Kinder Morgan, based in Houston, is proposing a C$5.4
billion ($5.3 billion) expansion of its Trans Mountain line to
890,000 barrels a day from 300,000 currently. British Columbia’s
election is May 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
