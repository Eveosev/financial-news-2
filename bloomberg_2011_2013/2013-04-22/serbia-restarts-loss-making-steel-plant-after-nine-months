Zelezara Smederevo ,  Serbia ’s sole
steel mill, fired up one of its two furnaces today, restarting
production after more than nine months as the government looks
for an investor in the unprofitable plant.  The sale of the planned monthly output of 70,000 tons has
been arranged for the year, Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said
in a statement after visiting the state-owned steelworks in
Smederevo, east of  Belgrade. Talks are under way with “one of
the biggest steelmakers in Europe on cooperation or possible
partnership with Zelezara,” he said without elaborating.  Serbia has sought to sell Zelezara since January 2012 when
 U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  gave up on the plant and sold it back to the
state for $1. Following a failed sales tender, the government
decided to restart production, even at a projected loss of 20
million euros ($26.1 million) in 2013. Employees have agreed to
a 20 percent wage cut as part of efforts to curb losses.  Zelezara may get a preliminary contract with  Fiat SpA (F)  for
supplying the car maker with galvanized steel, Dinkic said. The
arrangement would help fund upgrades, including in making
automotive-grade metal the plant doesn’t offer now, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
