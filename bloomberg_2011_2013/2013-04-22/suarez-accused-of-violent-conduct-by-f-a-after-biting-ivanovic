England’s Football Association
charged Liverpool forward  Luis Suarez  with violent conduct after
he bit Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic during a game yesterday.  The governing body announced the move in an e-mailed
statement.  “The incident was not seen by the match officials and has
therefore been retrospectively reviewed,” the F.A. said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
