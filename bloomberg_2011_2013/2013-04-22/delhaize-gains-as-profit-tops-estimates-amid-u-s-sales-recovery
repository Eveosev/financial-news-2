Delhaize Group SA (DELB) , the owner of the
Food Lion supermarkets, rose in Brussels trading after reporting
earnings that beat analyst estimates as sales at U.S. stores
open at least a year climbed at the fastest pace in 1 1/2 years.  Delhaize gained as much as 8.9 percent to 46.45 euros, the
highest  intraday  value since January 2012, and traded 3.04 euros
higher at 45.72 euros by 9:12 a.m. local time. The shares have
advanced 51 percent so far this year, the  best performance  in
the Stoxx 600 Retail Index.  First-quarter operating profit before one-time items rose
13 percent to 214 million euros ($279 million), the Brussels-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts projected a
decline to 175 million euros, according to the average of 17
 estimates  published on the company’s website. Comparable sales
in the U.S. advanced 1.9 percent, the most in six quarters, and
rose 2.4 percent in  Belgium , corrected for a calendar impact.  Delhaize said favorable weather and easing retail deflation
helped to fuel the sales recovery in the U.S., where a slide in
revenue was halted in the fourth quarter following price cuts
and a brand overhaul covering 62 percent of the 1,127 Food Lion
stores so far. The closure of 34 unprofitable Sweetbay
supermarkets in  Florida  will boost earnings by about 20 million
euros this year and losses at Bottom Dollar Food, Delhaize’s
discount format in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas, will
“progressively disappear”, Chief Financial Officer Pierre Bouchut said on a conference call on Jan. 17.  ‘Bigger Drags’  “The swing from the fourth quarter is too big,” Andrew Gwynn and John Kershaw, analysts at Exane BNP Paribas in  London ,
wrote in a note today. “Either the group has eased back on
price investments or the other drags that have seemingly eased
were far bigger drags than expected.”  Delhaize  forecast  operating profit before one-time items
will decline to about 775 million euros from 810 million euros a
year earlier, assuming stable exchange rates. That compares with
analyst  projections  of 741.5 million euros, the average of 13
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  A planned investor day on May 8, when Delhaize was also
scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, was postponed to
give a “more comprehensive” strategy update, according to
today’s preliminary statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
