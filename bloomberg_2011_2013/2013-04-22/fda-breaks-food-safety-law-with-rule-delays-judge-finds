The U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration  is violating  food-safety  law by delaying
regulations intended to help prevent outbreaks of food-borne
illnesses, a federal judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland,
California, said the agency has “admittedly failed to comply
with the mandatory rule-making schedule” of the Food Safety and
Modernization Act, signed into law by President  Barack Obama  in
January 2011. The FDA had 18 months to issue new regulations.
The agency said the “aggressive timelines” have “proven to be
unachievable,” Hamilton said in a ruling.  “Endless delay does not serve any purpose of the FMSA,”
she said. She ordered the FDA to come up with proposed deadlines
for regulations by May 20.  The food modernization act is supposed to better protect
public health, including guarding against outbreaks of illnesses
by strengthening the food safety system, the Center for Food
Safety said in a complaint filed in August.  Shelly Burgess, an FDA spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Center for Food Safety v. Hamburg,
4:12-cv-04529, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
