Treasury 10-year note yields traded
at almost the lowest level this year as the U.S. prepared to
sell $35 billion in two-year debt tomorrow, the first of three
note auctions this week totaling $99 billion.  Treasury volatility as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE index  fell to a record 50.58 basis points, below
the previous record of 51 basis points reached in December.
Benchmark yields remained under the 200-day moving average for a
seventh day as sales of previously owned U.S. homes unexpectedly
dropped in March, showing uneven progress in the industry.
Yields climbed earlier after the re-election of  Italy ’s
president boosted speculation he will help resolve political
gridlock.  The auctions “won’t disturb the current fabric of the
market,” said Jim Vogel, head of agency-debt research at FTN
Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee . “Only a series of positive
economic data will do that. There will be acceptable demand.”  The benchmark U.S. 10-year  yield  declined one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.69 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, below its 200-day
moving average of 1.75 percent. It touched 1.67 percent on April
17, the least since Dec. 12. The 2 percent note due in February
2023 fell 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face value, to 102 3/4.
The 30-year bond yield fell one basis point to 2.88 percent.  “We’ve got to test the lows before we really get a
conviction as to what’s going to happen,” Vogel said.
“Otherwise, we’re just in a range of 1.63 to 1.85 percent.”  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $35 billion in five-year
notes on April 24 and $29 billion in seven-year debt the next
day.  Treasury Demand  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$632 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $2.95 in
bids per dollar of debt sold, compared with $3.15 last year,
data released by the Treasury and compiled by Bloomberg shows.  That is the fewest bids since 2009, when the Treasury
attracted 2.50 times the amount of bids relative to the debt on
offer. The ratio of bids to debt sold has set records in each of
the past three years reaching 2.99 times in 2010, 3.04 times in
2011 before setting the new mark this year.  Treasuries returned 0.9 percent this month through April
19, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. German
government bonds gained 0.1 percent, the indexes show.  “There seems to be demand for Treasuries, even with these
low yields,” said Brian Edmonds, head of interest rates in New
York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Federal Reserve.  Fed Buying  The Fed purchased $3.73 billion of securities maturing
between January 2019 and March 2020 today as part of its
monetary-stimulus program known as quantitative easing. Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke has pumped more than $2.5 trillion into the
economy to fulfill the central bank’s twin mandates of full
employment and price stability.  Wall Street’s biggest bond dealers see little chance the
Fed will slow the pace of  debt purchases  designed to boost
economic growth before year-end, even as policy makers face
calls to curb the buying.  Of the Fed’s primary dealers, 14 said in a Bloomberg survey
that the central bank won’t start to reduce its $85 billion
monthly bond buying until the last three months of 2013. Twelve
forecast they will end in mid-2014 or later. Fifteen say it will
take until at least June 2015 for policy makers to raise the
record low benchmark interest-rate target of zero to 0.25
percent.  ‘Too Early’  “It’s still too early” to end the bond buying, Rajiv Setia, head of U.S. interest-rate research at Barclays Plc in
New York, a primary dealer, said in an April 19 telephone
interview. “This is the only tool they have. They’re doing all
they can. At the end of the day, the benefits outweigh any risks
of a bubble for now.”  Barclays forecasts the Fed will slow its pace of purchases
in the first three months of 2014 and end them by June next
year.  Purchases of U.S.  previously owned houses , tabulated when a
contract closes, fell 0.6 percent to a 4.92 million annual rate
last month, figures from the National Association of Realtors
showed today in  Washington . The median forecast of 75 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg projected sales would increase to a 5
million rate.  Italy’s Giorgio Napolitano, 87, was sworn in for a second
seven-year term today in  Rome  and may begin consultations on a
new government as soon as tomorrow. He was re-elected on April
20 after the country’s divided parliament failed to agree on a
candidate in the first five rounds of voting, an impasse that
led Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani to resign.  Italy’s two-year note yield fell 10 basis points to 1.23
percent after dropping to 1.208 percent, the lowest level since
Bloomberg began compiling data on the securities in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
