New Zealand ’s  North Island  may
receive further rainfall today, helping ease the most widespread
drought in at least 30 years that curbed milk output, as
residents assess damage from a weekend of heavy showers.  Parts of the Bay of Plenty, on the northern coast, may get
30 millimeters (1.2 inches) to 50 millimeters of  rain  between 9
a.m. and 6 p.m. local time, MetService said on its website today.
The city of Tauranga received more than 200 millimeters over the
weekend, John Corbett, media meteorologist at the forecaster,
said by phone from Wellington.  Whole- milk  powder climbed to a record last week as a
drought declared across the entire North Island curbed milk
production. Milk collection slumped 16.3 percent last month from
a year earlier and declined 2.3 percent in February, Auckland-
based  Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. (FCG) , the world’s largest dairy
shipper, said this month. The country may receive near-normal
rainfall through June, helping boost soil moisture, according to
the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.  “A complex area of low pressure is currently crossing New
Zealand,” MetService said in a statement. “Humid, unstable air
associated with this system is bringing bursts of heavy rain and
thunderstorms to parts of the North Island and upper  South
Island .”  Residents in parts of Tauranga left their homes because of
heavy rain, while parts of Nelson, on the South Island, were
also  flooded , the New Zealand Herald reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
