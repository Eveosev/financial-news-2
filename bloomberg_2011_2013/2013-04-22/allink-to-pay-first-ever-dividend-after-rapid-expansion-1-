AS Tallink Grupp (TAL1T)  proposed its
first-ever dividend as the largest Baltic ferry company reduced
debts following a fast expansion and renewal of its fleet in
recent years.  Tallink proposed a 5 euro cents ($0.07) per share dividend,
for a total payout of 33.5 million euros, on last year’s net
income of 56.3 million euros, the company said in a regulatory
statement today. This compares with a 3 euro-cent forecast by
Swedbank Equity Research.  Tallink, which transports passengers and cargo mainly
between the Swedish, Finnish and Estonian capitals, in 2006 took
over Finnish rival Silja Line in the biggest acquisition ever by
an Estonian company.  The third-largest ferry operator globally with revenues
behind  Denmark ’s DFDS Group and  Sweden ’s Stena Line AB has spent
1.3 billion euros in the last decade to build new ships. Its
equity ratio, or the ratio of total equity to total assets, rose
to 43.7 percent at the end of last year from 33 percent in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
