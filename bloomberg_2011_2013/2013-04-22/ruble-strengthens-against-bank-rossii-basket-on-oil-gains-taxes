The ruble pared last week’s slump
as oil rose for a third day and the need to settle taxes spurred
demand for the Russian currency from exporters.  The ruble appreciated 0.3 percent against the dollar-euro
basket to 35.9386 by 2:16 p.m. in Moscow after a 1.9 percent
drop last week. The central bank targets the basket to smooth
fluctuations that can hurt exporter competitiveness. The ruble
strengthened 0.2 percent against the dollar to 31.6000.  Brent oil gained for a third day in  London , rising 1
percent to $100.67 per barrel. Revenue from sales of crude and
natural gas comprise about 50 percent of  Russia ’s state budget
income. Russian companies are due to pay 200 billion rubles
($6.3 billion) in taxes today and 200 billion rubles on April
25, Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief economist for Russia at Bank of
America Corp., said by e-mail.  “Active selling of export revenue will more than
compensate the negative pressure on the ruble,” OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) 
analysts led by Vladimir Kolychev wrote in a note to clients.  The ruble continued to trade weaker than 35.65 to the
basket, the level beyond which the central bank spends about $70
million a day to curb declines, according to traders. Bank
Rossii reported it sold the equivalent of 2.2 billion rubles
($70 million) in foreign currency on April 18, the regulator
said today on  its website .  The yield on benchmark OFZ bonds due February 2027 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.03 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
