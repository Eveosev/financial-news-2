Alternative Energy  Ltd., a
Singaporean developer of energy-saving technologies, won an
order to provide engineering, procurement and construction
services to PT Mega Urip Pesona solar parks in Indonesia.  LDK Solar Co. (LDK)  will supply panels to some plants under a
deal last year, and a planned $600 million loan from China will
provide funding, Alternative Energy said today in a statement.
Separately, a 10 to 50 megawatt park will be built in Bali, and
nine 10-megawatt plants elsewhere in Indonesia.  Alternative Energy will be paid by Mega Urip, an Indonesian
project developer, at a rate of at least 5 cents a watt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
