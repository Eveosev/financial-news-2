China ’s securities regulator asked
brokerages to set up a system to better manage microblog
accounts operated by the firms and their employees, the
 Securities Times  reported today.  Securities firms should identify a contact person in charge
of their websites and executives’ microblogs, the Securities
Times  reported , citing a notice issued by the China Securities
Regulatory Commission and an unidentified official from the
regulator.  The measure is aimed at ensuring that microblog users from
the  securities industry  will act responsibly when sharing
information on the Internet, the newspaper said. The press
office of the securities regulator in Beijing didn’t immediately
respond to a phone call and a faxed query seeking comments.  The increased popularity of social media such as Sina
Corp.’s weibo microblog service in China, the world’s largest
Internet market by users, is prompting greater scrutiny by the
government. Chinese media regulator last week stepped up
controls on news organizations’s use of social media, including
barring the retransmission of content from overseas media and
websites without permission.  The State Administration of Radio Film and Television also
said that editorial employees must get permission to set up
microblogs for work purposes and to release any information they
acquire when on duty, according an article dated April 16 on the
regulator’s online publication chinaxwcb.com.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
