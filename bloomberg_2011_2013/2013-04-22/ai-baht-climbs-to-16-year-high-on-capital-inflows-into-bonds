Thailand ’s baht touched a 16-year
high after global funds boosted holdings of local bonds amid
signs policy makers will refrain from curbing capital inflows
that have fueled the region’s best  exchange-rate  rally.  Central bank Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul, who on April
19 said the currency has started to move beyond fundamentals,
and Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong have ruled out capital
controls. The baht has advanced 7 percent this year, beating a
1.9 percent gain in India’s rupee and 0.8 percent in China’s
 yuan . Foreigners  bought  $2 billion more Thai sovereign debt than
they sold this month through April 19, adding to net purchases
of $9.8 billion in the first quarter, official figures show.  “Inflows into bonds are continuing to put appreciation
pressure on the baht,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist
covering  emerging markets  at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute
Inc. in Tokyo. “They seem to be tolerant in general with the
appreciation and are unlikely to introduce any tough measures.”  The currency climbed 0.4 percent to 28.57 per dollar as of
8:48 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 28.56 today and April 19, the strongest level since a
devaluation in July 1997 that sparked the Asian financial
crisis. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, increased nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.38 percent.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 rose one basis point to 3.40 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
