Cattle futures fell on signs of
increasing supplies of animals in the U.S. Hog prices also
dropped.  About 1.899 million cattle were placed in  feedlots  last
month, up 6 percent from 1.792 million in March 2012, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said April 19. That compares to the
1.5 percent decline projected by 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The placement figure was “pretty negative,”
said  Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures Inc. in
Oklahoma City.  “The thing that’s probably the most disappointing is there
was so much optimism built in this market that we have such
tight numbers,” Broadbent said in a telephone interview. “The
demand is not there to make this thing be a lot better.”  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$1.20875 a pound at 10:22 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the third straight drop, the longest slide
since March 15.  Feedlot operators typically buy year-old animals that weigh
500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The
cattle are fattened on corn for four to five months until they
weigh about 1,300 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slumped 0.2
percent to $1.45775 a pound.  Hog futures for June settlement slipped 1 percent to 89.325
cents a pound on the CME. The commodity was up 5.2 percent in
2013 through April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
