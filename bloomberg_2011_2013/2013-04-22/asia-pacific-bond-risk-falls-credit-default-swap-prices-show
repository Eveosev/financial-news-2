The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment fell, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  slid 1 basis point to 113 basis points
as of 8:24 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Westpac Banking Corp. prices show.
The index is on course for its lowest close since March 19,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 1.5 basis
points to 114.25 as of 10:12 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac. The gauge is set for its first decline since April 11,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1 basis point to 92
basis points as of 9:24 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index, which has ranged from 90.5 to 148.1 this year,
is poised for its lowest close since April 15, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
