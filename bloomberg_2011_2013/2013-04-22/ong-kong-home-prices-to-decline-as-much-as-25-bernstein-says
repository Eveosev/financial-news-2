Hong Kong  home prices  will fall as
much as 25 percent after the government stepped up measures to
curb an asset bubble and as banks raised  mortgage rates ,
according to Sanford C. Bernstein H.K. Ltd.  The number of new apartment sales will “remain largely
subdued” with developers shifting their focus to cheaper and
smaller units to boost sales, analysts led by Kenneth Tsang
wrote in a report today.  An index tracking  home prices  dropped the most in almost
three years in the week ended April 14 after the government
introduced its toughest yet measures to cool prices on Feb. 22.
Prices could fall as much as 20 percent over the next two years,
Deutsche Bank AG said in a report last month.  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1) , which last month lowered prices
by almost 10 percent at a project in response to the government
curbs, may introduce more price cuts to boost sales, said the
Bernstein analysts. The builder is controlled by  Li Ka-shing ,
the city’s richest man.  The analysts assigned an underweight rating to Hong Kong
developers and are advising investors to sell  Henderson Land 
Development Co. because of its “strong competition with  Cheung
Kong ,” and Sino Land Co., which has “large exposure in larger
units within its own portfolio.”  Stamp Duty  Shares of Cheung Kong rose 0.3 percent to HK$116.80 at the
close of trading in Hong Kong, trimming their loss this year to
1.9 percent. Henderson Land rose 1.3 percent to HK$56.80, taking
this year’s gain to 3.8 percent, while Sino Land added 0.9
percent to HK$12.88, reducing the 2013 drop to 7.6 percent.  The Hang Seng Property Index, which tracks the shares of
nine of the city’s biggest developers, rose 0.4 percent and is
up 1.5 percent this year, compared with a 2.7 percent drop in
the benchmark  Hang Seng Index  in 2013.  Home prices fell 1.41 percent in the week ended April 14,
the fourth-straight weekly decline, according to an index
compiled by Centaline Property Agency Ltd., Hong Kong’s biggest
closely held realtor. It was the biggest drop since May 2010.  Before February’s measures, a housing shortage, low
mortgage costs and buying by mainland Chinese helped prices more
than double since the start of 2009 even as policy makers
attempted to rein in gains amid an outcry over affordability.  The government on Feb. 22 doubled the stamp duty on all
property transactions higher than HK$2 million ($257,612), while
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority told banks to maintain the risk
weighting for new home loans at a minimum of 15 percent to help
protect them against a drop in home values.  To contact the reporter on this story:
