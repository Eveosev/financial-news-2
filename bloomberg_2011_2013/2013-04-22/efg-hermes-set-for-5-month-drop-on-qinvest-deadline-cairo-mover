EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO)  fell the
most in five months on speculation the planned takeover of
 Egypt ’s largest investment bank by QInvest LLC may be scrapped.  Shares of the Cairo-based company fell 3.3 percent, the
most since Nov. 25, to 10.46 Egyptian pounds at the close in
Cairo. Trading volume rose to 78 percent above the stock’s
three-month daily average. Egypt’s benchmark EGX 30 Index lost
0.7 percent, retreating for a second day.  An agreement signed last year allowing QInvest to become
the majority shareholder in a company that will hold EFG-
Hermes’s main business lines of brokerage, investment banking
and asset management is set to expire on May 3. Prime Minister
Hisham Qandil said April 16 the process for the deal would be
completed within that week, according to financial daily Al
Borsa.  “Sentiment has turned negative for the stock as it appears
the deal might not go through,” Wafik Dawood, director of
institutional sales at Cairo-based Mega Investments Securities,
said by phone. “Nothing has happened since the Prime Minister’s
comments last week and we’re getting closer to the deadline.”  EFG-Hermes said April 16 it’s awaiting the go-ahead from
Egypt’s capital markets regulator to start transferring assets
to complete the deal. Terms of the deal include a 4 Egyptian-
pound dividend per share once the transaction is done.  The shares have lost 5.9 percent since then, compared with
a 1.5 percent slide for the  EGX 30 Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
