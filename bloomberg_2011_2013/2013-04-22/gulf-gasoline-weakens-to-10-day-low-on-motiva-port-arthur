Spot gasoline in the Gulf weakened
versus futures, shrinking to the lowest level in 10 days, as
Motiva Enterprises LLC restarted units at the 600,000-barrel-a-
day  Port Arthur , Texas, refinery, the largest in the U.S.  Motiva started equipment that was halted by an area power
failure April 14. Kimberly Windon, a company spokeswoman in
Houston, did not immediately return an e-mail asking for an
update on the status of the plant.  The premium for reformulated,  84-octane gasoline  on the
 Gulf Coast  retreated 0.75 cent to 3.5 cents a gallon above
futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:57 p.m., the
least since April 12.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel was unchanged
at a discount of 1.25 cents against Nymex futures.  Supplies of gasoline in the region fell 565,000 barrels to
73.6 million in the week ended April 14, while  distillate
stockpiles  gained 267,000 barrels to 35.8 million, according to
Energy Information Administration data.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , slipped $1.05 to $24.96
a barrel. The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil dropped
$1.75 to $12.26 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
