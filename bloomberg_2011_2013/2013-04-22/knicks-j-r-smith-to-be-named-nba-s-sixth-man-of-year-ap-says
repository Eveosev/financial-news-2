J.R. Smith of the  New York Knicks 
has been named the  National Basketball Association ’s Sixth Man
of the Year, the first player from the franchise to receive the
award since John Starks in 1997.  Smith, who averaged 18.1 points and 5.3 rebounds while
coming off the bench for 80 games during the regular season,
finished ahead of Jamal Crawford of the  Los Angeles Clippers  and
Jarrett Jack of the Golden State Warriors.  A 27-year-old guard, Smith becomes the third Knick to
receive the honor, joining Starks and Anthony Mason, who won it
for the 1994-95 campaign.  In his ninth year in the NBA after being selected 18th by
the New Orleans Hornets in 2004, Smith’s scoring and rebounding
totals both were career highs, helping New York (54-28) to an
Atlantic Division title and a No. 2 seed in the Eastern
Conference for the NBA playoffs. It was his second year with the
Knicks after playing the previous five with the  Denver Nuggets .  Smith received 484 of a possible 1,084 points from a panel
of 121 sports writers and broadcasters in the U.S. and Canada.
Crawford had 352 votes, while Jack collected 170, the National
Basketball Association said in a statement.  The Knicks lead the Boston Celtics 1-0 in their best-of-
seven first-round playoff series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
