Hungary  plans to boost its energy
ties with Russia, threatening to widen the central European
country’s trade gap with its second-biggest trading partner,
according to Hungarian State Secretary  Peter Szijjarto .  “If we didn’t do anything to balance this out,” the
deficit “would increase in the near future as the already
diverse energy cooperation between Hungary and Russia is
expected to widen,” Szijjarto said in Moscow today at the
opening of the country’s trading mission, formed to help
exporters break into the Russian market.  Hungary wants to boost its exports to Russia to prevent the
existing $5 billion annual trade gap from deteriorating,
Szijjarto said. Hungary relies on Russia for most of its natural
gas imports, tilting the  trade balance  in Moscow’s favor.  Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  is seeking to boost
exports and investments as part of his “eastern opening”
strategy to help lift the economy out of its second recession in
four years. Last October, Russian gas exporter OAO Gazprom
signed an agreement with Hungary’s state-owned energy company
MVM Zrt. to build the 600 million-euro ($783 million) Hungarian
section of the South Stream pipeline.  The former communist country wants to increase its
agricultural and food exports to Russia and seeks to help
Hungarian companies win tenders for the Sochi 2014 Winter
Olympics, the 2018 soccer  World Cup  and regional development
projects, Szijjarto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
