Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that
the selloff in copper was “overdone” and it remains bullish on
the metal at a lower price.  The bank cut its three-month estimate to $7,500 a metric
ton from $8,000, lowered its six-month prediction to $8,000 from
$9,000, and the 12-month forecast fell to $7,000 from $8,000,
Goldman analysts including London-based Max Layton and Hong
Kong-based Roger  Yuan  said in a report dated today. Copper for
three-month delivery traded at $6,905 today.  The metal has lost 13 percent this year and slumped into a
 bear market  as  Europe  struggled with its debt crisis and growth
slowed in China, the biggest metals consumer. Europe and China
account for about 60 percent of world consumption. Inventories
tracked by the London Metal Exchange almost doubled in 2013.  The forecasts have been downgraded “to acknowledge the
increasing willingness of the market to price future surplus
ahead of time” and the risks to growth in the broader emerging
market, the report said.  While prices have suffered on concerns  China’s economy  may
slow, the bank said the country’s “underlying cyclical growth
is likely stronger than the headline figures suggest.”  Copper in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange is being drawn down, it said. The bank estimated bonded
stockpiles at 510,000 tons from 715,000 tons in early March and
noted that futures in  Shanghai  are in backwardation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
