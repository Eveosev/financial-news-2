Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso
said he’s concerned that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may lose his
focus on the economy in coming months, the Wall Street Journal
reported on its website.  Abe could shift his attention to areas such as education
and constitutional amendments after upper-house elections in
July, the newspaper cited Aso as saying in an interview in
 Washington .  Aso’s own role is to keep the government focused on the
economy for a few more years, Aso reportedly said. A self-
sustaining Japanese recovery may be a few years away and
achieving a 2 percent inflation target may take longer than the
central bank expects, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
