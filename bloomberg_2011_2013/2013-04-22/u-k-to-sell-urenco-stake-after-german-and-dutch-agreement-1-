The U.K. will sell part or all of
its one-third shareholding in Urenco Ltd., a uranium-enrichment
company, after an agreement with its German and Dutch partners.  “It makes good commercial sense now and is consistent with
our position that assets should be sold where ownership itself
does not deliver any policy objective,” Business and Energy
Minister  Michael Fallon  said today in an e-mailed statement.  The sale of Urenco, based in Stoke Poges,  England , may draw
interest after the company last month posted a 12 percent jump
in full-year earnings, and as the government seeks to raise
funds to reduce a deficit. The U.K. plans to raise as much as 3
billion pounds ($4.6 billion) by the year-end through a sale,
the Financial Times reported on March 30, without citing anyone.  Sales in 2012 jumped 23 percent to 1.6 billion euros.  The U.K. is being advised by Morgan Stanley and further
details will be available in the summer, Fallon said.  The Netherlands holds a third of Urenco, and EON SE and RWE
AG the rest. Ownership change must be agreed by shareholders, as
well as the German government, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
