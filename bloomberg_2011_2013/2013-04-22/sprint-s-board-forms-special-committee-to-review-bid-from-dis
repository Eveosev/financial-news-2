Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-
largest U.S. wireless carrier, said its board has formed a
special committee to evaluate a takeover bid from  Dish Network
Corp. (DISH) , which is seeking to counter an offer from  SoftBank Corp. (9984)   Larry Glasscock, James Hance, Janet Hill, William Nuti and
Rodney O’Neal will serve on the committee, with Glasscock acting
as chairman, Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said today in a
statement. Bank of America Merrill Lynch will act as its
financial adviser, while Shearman & Sterling LLP will be the
legal counsel.  Dish, the satellite-TV company controlled by billionaire
 Charlie Ergen , offered $25.5 billion for Sprint last week,
topping a $20.1 billion bid by Tokyo-based SoftBank in October.
The Japanese company has argued that its bid has “superior
short- and long-term benefits” compared with Dish’s “highly
conditional preliminary proposal.”  Dish said it welcomed the committee review and is open to
meeting with Sprint’s board.  “We are confident that the Sprint board will share our
view that this proposal is superior on several fronts,” Dish
said in a statement.  Sprint shares were unchanged at $7.17 at the close in New
York. The stock has climbed 26 percent this year. Dish gained
2.8 percent to $40.10.  Dish is offering $4.76 in cash and 0.05953 of a Dish share
for each Sprint share. At today’s close, that offer is worth
$7.15 a share. Sprint’s higher stock price indicates investors
expect a bigger bid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
