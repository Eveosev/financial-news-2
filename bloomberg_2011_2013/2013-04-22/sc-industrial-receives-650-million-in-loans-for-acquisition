MSC Industrial Direct Co. (MSM) , a
provider of office and industrial equipment, got $650 million in
loans to help finance its acquisition of  Barnes Group Inc. (B) ’s
North American distribution business.  The funding consists of a $250 million term loan and a $400
million revolving credit line, MSC said today in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire. The Melville, New York-based company
said it borrowed $120 million from the revolver and also used
cash to finance the deal.  MSC Industrial agreed in February to buy the North American
distribution business of Barnes Group for $550 million. The deal
almost doubles the company’s sales force, Erik Gershwind, MSC’s
president and chief executive officer, said in the statement
today.  Under a revolver, money can be borrowed again once it’s
repaid; in a  term loan , it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
