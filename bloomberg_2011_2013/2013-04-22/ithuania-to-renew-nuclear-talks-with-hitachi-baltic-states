Lithuania  will renew talks about
building a nuclear plant with  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  as well as other
Baltic nations Latvia and  Estonia , seeking ways to make the
project cheaper, Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said.  “The current Visaginas nuclear power plant project, as its
terms stand now, is too expensive for Lithuania,” Butkevicius
said today, according to a statement e-mailed by his office in
Vilnius. “Continuing it is only possible if the commercial
terms are improved and other conditions are met.”  Lithuania, which isn’t connected to European Union energy
grids, relies on imports of Russian power and gas, particularly
since closing the Soviet-built Ignalina nuclear plant in 2009.
The Cabinet, which took office in December, must propose an
energy-independence strategy to Parliament by May 15.  If regional partners and  Japan ’s Hitachi, the strategic
investor, prove willing to compromise, the nuclear plant would
be a complement for power links that Lithuania is building with
Poland and  Sweden  to reduce dependence on imported Russian
electricity, Butkevicius said in the statement.  He spoke after meeting with an energy-strategy working
group led by Energy Minister Jaroslav Neverovic, which will
present its findings to heads of the four coalition parties this
evening and to Parliament on Thursday, Butkevicius’s
spokeswoman, Evelina Butkute-Lazdauskiene, said by phone.  The working group recommends continuing the Visaginas
project only if regional partners sign a contract committing to
share costs and responsibilities, and if together with the
strategic investor they can help get cheaper financing,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
