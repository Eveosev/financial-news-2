Afghan insurgents kidnapped nine
people including eight Turkish nationals after their helicopter
crashed near the border with  Pakistan  in the country’s east, a
government official said.  One Afghan citizen was also captured when the helicopter
made an emergency landing in the Azra district of Logar province
yesterday, Azra Governor Hamidullah Hamid said by phone. The
British Broadcasting Corporation said the Taliban was
responsible, citing members of the group it didn’t name.  The helicopter belonged to a private Afghan company and not
the military, Defense Ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri said. The
U.S.-led  International Security Assistance Force  is helping
investigate the crash, spokesman Bryan Gatewood said.  President  Barack Obama  has said that a bulk of the 66,000
U.S. forces now in  Afghanistan  will return home by the end of
2014, after which a smaller number of troops may continue to
train and advise Afghan forces as well as carry out counter-
terrorism operations. While he hasn’t yet said how many U.S.
troops will remain after 2014, the U.S. has indicated that about
8,000 to 12,000 allied troops are likely to stay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
