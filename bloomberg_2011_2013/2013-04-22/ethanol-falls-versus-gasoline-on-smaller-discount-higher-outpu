Ethanol weakened against gasoline
on speculation a tighter discount to the motor fuel will reduce
demand and higher returns to make the additive will spur output.  Ethanol’s price difference expanded 2.6 cents to 31.04
cents a gallon, widening for the second time in three days after
reaching of 27.1 cents April 17. Gasoline has dropped about 33
cents and ethanol has risen about 9.8 cents since April 1, when
the margin was 74.05 cents. The crush margin, or the difference
between the cost of a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to
make it, has been positive for all but one day in April,
encouraging production. Renewable Identification Numbers were
mixed.  “Most of it has been the pressure on gasoline,” said
Jason Ward, an analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments LLC in
 Minneapolis . “The spread has narrowed. It certainly isn’t as
advantageous as 50-cent-plus.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery  slipped 2.9 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.459 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 12 percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery declined 0.3 cent to $2.7694 a
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  in the week ended April 12 fell 2.6
percent to 832,000 barrels a day, the lowest level for this time
of year in records going back to June 2010 and 14 percent below
the record 963,000 barrels a day in December 2011, data from the
Energy Information Administration show.  Crush Spread  Output was battered by record corn prices after the worst
drought since the 1930s slaughtered yields and devastated
returns to make the biofuel.  Corn for May delivery fell 6.25 cents, or 1 percent, to
$6.4575 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread was 11 cents a gallon, down from 12
cents on April 19. The amount doesn’t include revenue from the
sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production, which can be fed to livestock.  “I would forecast more production to come online based off
these margins,” Ward said. “If they don’t come back, it’s
because they’re in an area where they can’t get the corn. The
margins are there.”  Lower gasoline prices at filling stations may stoke demand
for the additive, he said.  RINs Mixed  Corn-based ethanol RINs  fell 2.9 percent to 66.5 cents, the
lowest level since March 26, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-
based ethanol, gained 2.5 percent to 81.5 cents.  The U.S. government uses RINS to track compliance with
mandates to use ethanol. Refiners can trade RINs, which are
attached to every gallon of ethanol for submission to the
Environmental Protection Agency.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended April 12, down from a
record 96 percent the previous week, the Energy Department’s
statistical agency said in an April 17 report.  Lower production rates have helped to deplete stockpiles of
the fuel. Inventories dropped 1.6 percent to 17.5 million
barrels, EIA said, down from 20 percent from a year ago, and
also at record seasonal lows.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 7.5 cents to $2.70 a
gallon on the West Coast, 5 cents to $2.56 on the Gulf Coast, 5
cents to $2.50 in Chicago and 8 cents to $2.63 in New York, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf narrowed 2.5
cents to 14 cents, the tightest since April 4. Chicago’s
discount to New York Harbor contracted 3 cents to 13 cents, the
smallest in a week.  U.S. refiners haven’t  imported  any of the biofuel since
March 29, EIA data show, compared to 21,000 barrels a day a year
earlier.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.46 a gallon last week,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Brazil, which uses sugarcane to
make the fuel, is the largest supplier of ethanol to the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
