Gunvor Group Ltd. sold a cargo of
 North Sea  Forties crude at a lower differential than the
previous trade, while Total SA failed to buy the grade for a
second session.  Iraq plans to cut exports of its Kirkuk crude in May from
the Turkish port of Ceyhan to 15 cargoes, four less than this
month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Gunvor sold Forties to Petroineos, the joint venture
between PetroChina Co. and Ineos Group Holdings SA, for loading
from May 3 to May 5 at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with the
last deal at minus 10 cents.  Total failed to buy a May 14 to May 17 lot at 30 cents less
than the benchmark, 10 cents lower than its unsuccessful bid in
the previous session, the survey showed.  Shell offered Forties for May 9 to May 11 at a discount of
10 cents.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days narrowed by 22 cents to a discount of 19 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the narrowest since March 20.  Brent for June settlement traded at $99.90 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $99.36 in the previous session. The July
contract was at $99.83 at the same time today, a discount of 7
cents to June.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals, the Platts
survey showed. The grade traded at a discount of 40 cents to the
benchmark in the Mediterranean and minus $1.20 in northwest
 Europe  in the previous session.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened by 19 cents to 37 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $1.27 a
barrel compared with $1.57 at the previous session’s close.  Shipments of Kirkuk crude will total 7.71 million barrels
in May, or 248,710 barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares
with 360,333 barrels planned for April.  Libya ’s state-run National Oil Corp. raised its official
selling price of benchmark Es Sider grade for May to a premium
of 10 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, 5 cents more than this
month, according to a price list obtained by  Bloomberg News .  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose 2 cents to $3.09 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Nigeria is poised to lose its spot as  Africa ’s biggest
crude producer to  Angola  for the first time since 2009 as oil
thieves sabotage pipelines, forcing producers including  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  to cut output.  The country’s production fell 270,000 barrels to 1.81
million barrels a day in March from the previous month, the
lowest level since September 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Output in Angola climbed by 50,000 barrels to 1.78
million barrels.  The loading schedules for Nigerian crudes are expected to
be released later this week, according to two people with
knowledge of the plans, asking not to be identified as the
information is confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
