It's a mansion fit for royalty. Or at least an elected official. Which is probably why former  San Francisco Mayor Joe Alioto  (1968-1976) once called this Beaux Arts estate his home. It's fit for a statesman, or someone who appreciates classic design and meticulous renovation, or someone with a ton of cash. Now the renovated mansion at  34 Presidio Ter, San Francisco, CA 94118  designed by renowned architect G. Applegarth is on the market for $8.98 million. The 1911 structure opens into a grand white marble reception hall with large public rooms for entertaining. There's a formal dining and living rooms plus a paneled library and a great room over lit by large skylight w/retractable screen. The updates include a solar heating system, a modern gourmet kitchen and breakfast/sitting area that opens to a side terrace and garden. Upstairs, there are four suites that sit off a U-shaped gallery, while the lower level features home theater, playroom, gym, wet bar, steam shower/sauna, wine vault and au pair suite. The mansion was last sold in 2008 for $9.5 million and had been sold in foreclosure in 1993 for $1.274.5 million. The prestigious property, located in the Presidio Heights neighborhood, also comes with a $3,410 annual association fee, according to listing agent  Dana Crowder of Coldwell Banker .
