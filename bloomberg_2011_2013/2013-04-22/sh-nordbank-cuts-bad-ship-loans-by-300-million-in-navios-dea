HSH Nordbank AG, the world’s
largest shipping bank, agreed to sell a portfolio of 10
unprofitable vessels to Greek freight company Navios Group to
reduce its risks on loans by about $300 million.  Navios, a Piraeus, Greece-based shipper, will pay $130
million for about 40 percent of the loans and guaranteed to
operate the five tankers and five container ships for at least
six years, the Hamburg-based bank said today in a statement.  The remaining $170 million will be converted into a
participating loan for 10 years, according to the statement.
During that period the German state-owned lender will receive 80
percent of the returns generated by the ships, excluding
operating and capital costs.  “The insolvent vessels, or those on the brink of
insolvency, are transferred to a highly professional operator
that is able to secure an economically feasible operation of the
vessels throughout the shipping crisis,” Wolfgang Topp, the
head of HSH’s restructuring unit, said in the statement. “There
is a significant reduction of risk for the financing bank.”  The ownership of the ships, which were built in 2006 or
later, will be transferred to Navios. They include tankers with
volumes of as much as 80,000 deadweight tons and container ships
with a capacity of as much as 3,400 standard containers.  HSH said it is in talks with owners of other vessels in its
loan portfolio to reach similar agreements to reduce its
holdings by more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
