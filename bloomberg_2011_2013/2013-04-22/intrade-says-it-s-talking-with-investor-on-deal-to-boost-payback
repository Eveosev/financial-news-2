     April 22 (Bloomberg) --  Intrade , an online betting website
that halted trading last month amid a probe into suspected
financial irregularities, said it’s in talks with at least one
firm that may invest in or partner with the company.  Any deal would have to at least match the benefits of
Intrade’s own proposal to repay members at least 50 percent of
their currently frozen funds, the Dublin-based company said
today in a statement on its website.  “At this time, we are very close to achieving the required
acceptance” from clients for the payments, Intrade said. “In
the very near future” the company hopes to announce that it
either has enough support to make the payments or a deal that
would boost benefits to members, it said. It didn’t identify the
investment firm in negotiations.  Intrade, which lets members bet on outcomes of events,
including U.S. presidential and Catholic papal elections,
stopped taking wagers and froze member accounts March 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
