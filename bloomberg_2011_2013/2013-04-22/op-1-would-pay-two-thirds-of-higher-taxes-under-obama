The top 1 percent of U.S. taxpayers
would pay 67 percent of the higher taxes called for in 2023
under President  Barack Obama ’s budget proposal, according to an
 analysis  released today by the nonpartisan  Tax Policy Center  in
 Washington .  Households making as little as $30,000 a year would pay
some higher taxes. By 2023, households making between $30,000
and $40,000 would pay an average of $54 more than if lawmakers
made no changes. Households making between $500,000 and $1
million would pay an average of $13,474 in higher federal taxes.  High-income and low-income families would encounter
different tax increases in Obama’s budget plan, which was
released on April 10 and calls for raising about $1 trillion
more over the next decade.  Top earners would be subject to a minimum tax rate of 30
percent, limits on their deductions and an increase in the
estate tax rate to 45 percent from 40 percent. They also would
have limits on the ability to contribute to tax-favored
retirement accounts and wouldn’t get to pay lower capital-gains
rates on their carried interest.  Lower-income households would receive benefits from
expansions of tax credits for child care and college tuition.
For some, those would be outweighed by increases in tobacco
taxes and Obama’s proposal to link tax brackets and the standard
deduction to the slower-growing chained  Consumer Price Index .  Campaign Promises  The inflation change included in the budget plan, suggested
as part of Obama’s pitch for a bipartisan budget deal, would
break the president’s campaign promises to prevent tax increases
for married couples making less than $250,000 a year and
individuals making less than $200,000.  “It is something we are prepared to do as part of a
balanced deficit-reduction package,” Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew told the House Ways and Means Committee on April 11.  Amy Brundage , a White House spokeswoman, didn’t respond to
an e-mailed request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
