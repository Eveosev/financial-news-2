Ireland’s Environment Minister Phil Hogan comments on the European Union proposal to bolster carbon
prices in the bloc’s emissions trading system.  Hogan, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the
EU in the first half of this year, made the comments before an
informal gathering of the bloc’s environment ministers in Dublin
today.  The EU carbon market fix, known as backloading, suffered a
defeat in the European Parliament last week after lawmakers
declined to support it and instead voted to send it back to the
assembly’s environment committee. The rescue plan designed by
the European Commission needs backing from both the Parliament
and EU governments to be enacted.  On carbon fix talks during Dublin meeting:  “It’s not tabled for a specific discussion but I’m sure
it’ll come up in the context of the discussions tomorrow in our
informal lunch on climate and energy policies.”  “Member states want to see the emissions trading system
continued so it’s a question of seeing what amendments can be
put forward at the Parliament level or at the council, in June
or later on, maybe in July.”  On outlook for backloading proposal:  ‘We’re disappointed with the outcome of the recent vote in
the plenary session of the European Parliament on backloading
but we do expect that after a period of reflection by the
European Parliament, when they have to refer it back to the
environment committee, as well as the council of ministers in
the context of the discussion tomorrow on future ambition and
climate change, that we will be able perhaps by the middle of
June to see if we have a road map towards revitalizing the
existing proposal with some minor changes.’’  On Germany’s position on current version of carbon fix:  “It’s unlikely that they will come to a definitive
conclusion on the existing proposal, which has been rejected by
the European Parliament, until after the general elections. But
we’re prepared to wait and see if there’s any modest changes
that can be made that can meet the wishes of the council,
commission and the Parliament.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
