China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s
largest phone company by subscribers, reported its weakest
profit growth in three quarters as higher costs eroded gains
from an increase in users of high-speed network services.  Net income rose  to 27.9 billion  yuan  ($4.5 billion) in the
first quarter, from 27.8 billion yuan a year earlier, the
Beijing-based operator said in a statement to the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange yesterday. Profit was expected to be 28 billion
yuan, based on the median of five analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg News.  Chief Executive Officer Li Yue is fighting to maintain
China Mobile’s lead in smartphone users over  China Unicom Hong
Kong Ltd. (762)  and China Telecom Corp. by subsidizing handsets for
third-generation data users and adding fourth-generation
services. The company said last month it will bear costs for the
TD-LTE network, or 4G network, previously borne by its state-
owned parent, boosting the listed unit’s capital spending 49
percent to 190.2 billion yuan this year.  “The results were a bit lower than our expectations,”
Ricky Lai, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Guotai Junan
International Holdings Ltd., said by e-mail. “The heavy handset
subsidies strategy in 2013, with the total estimated at 27
billion yuan, will worsen its profit margins.”  Lai said he had expected net income of 32.2 billion yuan
for the period.  Sales Growth  Sales rose 5.7 percent to 134.7 billion yuan in the
quarter. The company was expected to report sales of 134.1
billion yuan, according to the median estimate in the Bloomberg
survey.  China Mobile fell 1.2 percent to HK$81.60 at 9:54 a.m. in
Hong Kong trading. The  shares  have fallen 9.5 percent so far
this year, compared with a 3.4 percent drop in the benchmark
Hang Seng Index.  The profit growth in the period was the weakest since the
second quarter of 2012, when the company posted a decline.  While 3G users are on the rise, China Mobile isn’t seeing
the full benefit because of the “increasing cannibalization
effect” of free instant-messaging apps such as WeChat from
 Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  over traditionally profitable services
such as text messages, Lai said.  China Mobile added 26.4 million 3G users during the quarter
for a total of 114.4 million subscribers, according to data the
company released yesterday. Still, China Mobile’s share of the
nation’s total 1.13 billion wireless users fell to 64 percent in
February from 66 percent a year earlier, according to data
released last month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
