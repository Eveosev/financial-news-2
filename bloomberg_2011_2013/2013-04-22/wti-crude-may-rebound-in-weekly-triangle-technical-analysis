West Texas Intermediate may rebound
after reaching a technical-support level within a “triangle”
on the weekly chart, according to  Societe Generale  SA.  WTI, which lost 9.5 percent over the past three weeks in
 New York  trading, will probably recover as futures stay within
the triangle pattern going back to September, said Stephanie Aymes, a London-based technical analyst at  France ’s fourth-
largest bank. The formation has a lower and upper boundary of
about $86 and $98 a barrel this week.  “WTI has been evolving within a large triangle
consolidation,” Aymes said in a report dated April 19. “It
just hit the long-term rising trend line at $86 to $86.20, which
also coincides with the corrective channel support. A rebound is
to be expected.”  Crude for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
slid to as low as $85.90 a barrel last week before settling
higher, signaling a rebound from technical support. Futures
declined as U.S. fuel demand shrank and the  International
Monetary Fund  downgraded its forecasts for global economic
growth this year. The June contract, the most actively traded,
was up 42 cents at $88.69 in electronic trading at 11:05 a.m.
Singapore time.  WTI may rise as high as $89.40 a barrel and has longer-term
resistance at $90.25 to $90.55, according to Societe Generale’s
report. Investors typically sell contracts near technical-
resistance levels and buy when prices are close to chart
support.  To contact the reporter on this story:
