German  government bonds  were little
changed before a report that economists said will show  consumer
confidence  in the euro-region fell for the first time in five
months in April.  The 10-year German yield was about six basis points from
the  lowest  in almost nine months. An index of  household
confidence  in the currency bloc fell to minus 24 from minus 23.5
in March, the European Commission in Brussels will say today,
according to the median estimate of 29 analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey. France is scheduled to sell as much as 8 billion
euros ($10.5 billion) of bills today.  German 10-year bunds yielded 1.26 percent as of 7:09 a.m.
London time. It slid to 1.20 percent on April 5, the lowest
level since July 24. The price of the 1.5 percent security due
in February 2023 was at 102.17.  German bonds returned 0.8 percent this year through April
19, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
