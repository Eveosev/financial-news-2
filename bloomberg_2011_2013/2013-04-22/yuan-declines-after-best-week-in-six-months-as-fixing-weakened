The  yuan  fell, following its best
week in six months, after the People’s Bank of China set the
currency’s fixing at a level that prevents it from strengthening.  The PBOC cut the  reference rate  by 0.03 percent to 6.2415
per dollar today. That’s more than 1 percent weaker than April
19’s closing price, meaning the currency had to fall to stay
within its permitted trading band. China needs to sacrifice
short-term growth to make structural adjustments, central bank
Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  told  Bloomberg News  outside a meeting of
the  International Monetary Fund  in Washington on April 20. The
economy expanded 7.7 percent in the first quarter from a year,
earlier, compared with 7.9 percent in the previous three months.  “The market has downsized expectations for growth recently
after a weak gross domestic product print,” said  Sacha Tihanyi ,
a currency strategist at Bank of Novia Scotia in Hong Kong.
“But I am still bullish on the yuan.”  The yuan fell 0.08 percent to 6.1826 per dollar in Shanghai,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The
currency gained 0.24 percent last week, the most since the
period ended Oct. 14. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
 exchange-rate  swings used to price options, fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.44 percent.  The 7.7 percent growth rate in the first quarter is
“overall normal” compared with the government’s 2013 target of
7.5 percent, the PBOC’s Zhou said. “China’s undergoing economic
restructuring, which sometimes is not in lockstep with growth,”
he said.  The death toll from an earthquake in Sichuan province, the
nation’s strongest in three years, rose to 188 today, with about
11,500 injured, China Central Television reported. Bank of Novia
Scotia’s Tihanyi said he didn’t expect the disaster to have any
significant impact on the exchange rate.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan traded at 6.1790
per dollar, compared with 6.1797 at the end of last week.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.14 percent to
6.2545. The contracts traded at a 1.1 percent discount to the
spot rate in Shanghai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
