San Francisco  will investigate
allegations that  Nevada  has bused hundreds of indigent people
with mental illnesses out of state, including to the Northern
California city.  San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said his office
has opened a formal investigation and is requesting public
records from the Nevada Health and Human Services Department,
according to a letter today to Mike Willden, the agency’s
director.  The investigation follows reports in the Sacramento Bee
newspaper that the Rawson Neal Psychiatric Hospital, a mental-
health facility controlled by the state, put more than 1,500
mentally-ill patients on Greyhound Lines Inc. buses and sent
them to cities throughout the U.S. over the past five years,
with a third going to  California , including at least 36 to San
Francisco, Herrera said in a statement.  “Assuming the reports are true, Nevada’s practice of
psychiatric ‘patient dumping’ is shockingly inhumane and
illegal,” Herrera said. “We’re prepared to litigate
aggressively on behalf of San Francisco and its taxpayers to
recover whatever costs or damages we’re able to identify.”  While the hospital had procedures “to assist individuals
with mental illness without resources for discharging planning
out of state,” a state review found a “documentation error,”
Willden said in a statement. The hospital has taken steps to
review out-of-state discharges “to ensure the quality of
discharge planning and after-care plans,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
