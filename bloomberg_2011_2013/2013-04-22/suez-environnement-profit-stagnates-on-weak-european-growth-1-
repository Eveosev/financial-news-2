Suez Environnement (SEV) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest water company, said first-quarter profit remained
almost unchanged because of a “particularly difficult”
economic environment.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 0.8 percent to 570 million euros ($745
million) from a year earlier, the Paris-based company said today
in a statement. Revenue fell 2.6 percent to 3.5 billion euros.  Suez Environnement, which is 34 percent-owned by utility
 GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, said waste-treatment revenue dropped 5.3 percent as
the economic crisis in Europe continued to shrink volumes. The
utility, together with larger rival  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , has
seen demand for industrial waste collection slide after
manufacturers reduced factory output.  “We’ve seen a slump in volumes treated as well as a slump
in the prices of raw materials in the first quarter,” Chief
Financial Officer Jean-Marc Boursier said on a conference call.
“The trend hasn’t changed in the first half of April, with
volumes still down some 4 percent.”  The decline in  waste treatment  was offset by revenue growth
in the water division, which was up 3.3 percent, Suez said.  Prices of secondary raw materials were down as much as 10
percent during the quarter while “headwinds” continued in the
French water business, he said.  Suez kept its 2013 earnings guidance and will propose a
dividend of 0.65 euro a share.  The shares rose 1.7 percent to 10.01 euros today in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
