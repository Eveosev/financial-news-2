A gun battle between Nigerian
soldiers and suspected Islamic militants that began on April 19
killed at least 185 people in the northeast town of Baga.  The fighting began after a patrol was attacked near a
mosque where fighters with the Boko Haram group hid weapons in
the past, Brigadier General Austin Edokpaye said on a visit to
the area yesterday. Militants at the mosque “came out with
heavy firepower” including rocket-propelled grenades, he said.  “The soldiers were mindless that night,” Baga resident
Mallam Bana told the regional governor, Kashim Shettima, during
the visit. “They killed and burnt our houses, chased everyone
into the bush including women and children. So far we have
buried 185 corpses.”  Edokpaye denied the government was to blame for the deaths,
saying that Boko Haram members used civilians as human shields.
He said one military officer died.  Hundreds of people have been killed since Boko Haram began
a violent campaign in 2009 to impose Islamic law in  Africa ’s
biggest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
