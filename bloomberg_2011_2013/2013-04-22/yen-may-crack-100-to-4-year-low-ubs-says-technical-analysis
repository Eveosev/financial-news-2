The yen may weaken through the 100-
per-dollar level and another technical area to reach a 4 1/2-
year low, according to UBS AG.  If the Japanese currency breaches support at 101.45 per
dollar, it could decline to 105.75, the 62 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the yen’s appreciation from June 2007 to October
2011,  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy at
UBS in  London , wrote today in a note to clients. It last touched
that level in October 2008.  UBS’s dollar-yen focus “is on the psychological resistance
at 100,” Adcock wrote in a client note. “We expect this and
resistance offered by the 101.45 April 2009 to give way,
extending the gains. We continue to recommend increasing longs
on a close above 100.” A long position is a bet the dollar will
increase in value.  Japan ’s currency increased 0.2 percent to 99.31 per dollar
at 1:10 p.m. after earlier depreciating as much as 0.4 percent.
The yen touched 99.95 percent on April 11, its weakest level
since April 2009.  The yen has declined 11 percent this year, the worst
performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar fell 3.2
percent, while the New Zealand dollar led all gainers with a 4.9
percent increase.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
