Ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures
advanced for the third straight day after reaching a nine-month
low April 17. Crack spreads widened.  Futures rose as much as 1.5 percent. The fuel has climbed

 crack spread  versus May West Texas Intermediate crude widened 38
cents to $29.45 a barrel. The June  spread  versus Brent gained 18
cents to $17.11.  “It’s just a correction,” said  Andrew Lebow , senior vice
president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “Traders are
waiting for the market to settle out and see whether the
downward movement has backed off for the time being, or if
there’s further downside.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery advanced 0.93
