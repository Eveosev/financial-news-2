The U.S.  Supreme Court  ordered
reconsideration of a ruling that would require  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  to
defend against a lawsuit accusing the mining company of
contributing to genocide in  Papua New Guinea .  Setting aside a lower court ruling today, the justices
pointed to their  decision  last week scaling back the 1789 Alien
Tort Statute. That law, also being invoked in the Rio Tinto
case, has been a favorite tool of human-rights advocates seeking
to hold companies responsible for overseas atrocities.  Last week’s Supreme Court ruling threw out a suit accusing
two foreign-based units of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  of facilitating
torture and executions in Nigeria. The majority said the Alien
Tort Statute generally doesn’t apply to conduct beyond U.S.
borders.  Multinational companies have faced dozens of Alien Tort
Statute suits blaming them for human rights violations,
environmental wrongdoing and labor abuses.  The lawsuit against London-based  Rio Tinto  stems from the
deaths of thousands of indigenous people starting in 1988 on the
island of Bougainville, where Rio Tinto was part of a consortium
operating the world’s largest open copper pit.  Rio Tinto is accused of helping the military carry out the
killings by providing attack helicopters, munitions and other
support. The company denies the allegations.  The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said parts of the Rio Tinto lawsuit could go forward.  The case is Rio Tinto v. Sarei, 11-649.  To contact the reporter on this story:
