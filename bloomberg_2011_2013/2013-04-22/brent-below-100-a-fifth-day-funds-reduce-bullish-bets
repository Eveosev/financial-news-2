Brent crude  futures rose to a one-
week high above $100 a barrel on speculation last week’s drop
was excessive.  Brent advanced as much as 1.2 percent after the contract’s
14-day relative strength index slipped to 31 on April 19,
signaling prices had declined too rapidly. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index increased as much as 0.9 percent. Money managers reduced
net-long positions, or  wagers  that West Texas Intermediate will
rise, by 6.8 percent in the week ended April 16, according to
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They trimmed
holdings on Brent for the second week to the lowest since Dec.
18, data from ICE Futures Europe exchange show.  “There’s a recovery from the sell-off last week and crude
is growing in tandem with equities,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in  London , said by phone today. “Some
buy orders may have been triggered by Brent breaching $100, so
computers are driving the market to a degree.”  Brent for June settlement rose as much as $1.15 to $100.80
a barrel and was at $100.78 as of 1:24 p.m. London time. The
contract fell 3.4 percent last week. The front-month European
benchmark grade was at a premium of $11.60 to June WTI compared
with $11.38 on April 19.  WTI for May delivery, which expires today, was at $88.85 a
barrel, up 84 cents, in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after dropping 3.6 percent last week. The
more-active June future was up 92 cents at $89.19. The volume of
all Brent contracts traded was 11 percent below the 100-day
average while WTI was 14 percent above.  Qatar, Vitol  Crude will trade at $100 in the third quarter after a
second quarter correction driven by oversupply and a fall in
stock markets, the chief executive officer of Qatar
International Petroleum Marketing Co., or Tasweeq, Saad Al- Kuwari said today at the Middle East Petroleum and Gas
Conference in  Abu Dhabi .  Brent last closed above $100 on April 15 and has now fallen
for three weeks in a row, the longest run since November.  “I don’t see any great movement in the days to come,”
Vitol Group CEO  Ian Taylor  said at the same conference.
“There’s nothing special about $100. It can go a bit higher or
a bit lower.”  Global oil demand will grow by 1 million barrels a day in
2013 and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries needs
to maintain supplies at current levels to avoid a surplus this
year, Pierre Barbe, the head of trading and shipping at Total
SA, said in a speech today at the Abu Dhabi conference.  Hedge Funds  Net-long positions in WTI held by money managers, including
 hedge funds , commodity pools and commodity-trading advisers,
declined by 13,298 futures and options combined to 183,032, the
least since the week ended March 19, the CFTC report showed. It
was the biggest drop since the period ended Feb. 26.  Hedge funds and other money managers cut bullish bets on
Brent crude by 8,780 contracts in the week ended April 16, the
ICE Futures Europe exchange said today in its weekly Commitment
of Traders report.  “It’s too early to see a return of the longs, as I think
we need to see Brent above $100 to spark fund buying again,”
 Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in
London, said by e-mail today before the ICE data was published.  The average price for regular gasoline at U.S. pumps fell
11.04 cents a gallon in the past two weeks to $3.5363, according
to Lundberg Survey Inc. The survey covers the period ended April
19 and is based on information obtained at about 2,500 filling
stations by the Camarillo, California-based company. The average
price has dropped 25.87 cents from the peak on Feb. 22, and
37.64 cents from the price on April 20, 2012, Lundberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
