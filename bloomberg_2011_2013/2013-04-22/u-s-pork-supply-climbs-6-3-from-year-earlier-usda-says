Pork inventories in the U.S.
climbed 6.3 percent at the end of March from a year
earlier, the government said. Warehouses held a record
amount of beef at the end of the month, the agency said.  Warehouses held 648.789 million pounds (294,286 metric
tons) of pork, up from  610.318  million on March 31, 2012,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a report.
Inventories rose 2.4 percent from the end of February.  U.S.  exporters  shipped 820.8 million pounds of pork in
the two months through Feb. 28, down 14 percent from a year
earlier, the latest USDA data show. U.S. commercial output
of the meat this year will climb to the highest since at
least 1970, the government has projected.  “Consistently, they’ve kept hog kills high,” Dick Quiter, an account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview before the
report. “Exports being what they’ve been and domestic
demand being what it’s been, it would not be surprising to
see bigger numbers” in the freezer, he said.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.9 percent to
89.35 cents a pound at 11 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices were up 5.2 percent this year through
April 19.  As of March 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are
cured and sliced to make bacon, fell 22 percent from a year
earlier to 51.491 million pounds, the USDA said. Warehouse
supplies of ham rose 19 percent from a year earlier to
94.967 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of March were 7.6
percent larger than a year earlier at 617.886 million
pounds, the USDA said. Beef supplies rose 2 percent to a
record 513.243 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
