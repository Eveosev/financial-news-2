The United Arab Emirates’ energy
minister said he considers global oil markets to be “well-
balanced,” with adequate supplies of crude, a month before OPEC
meets to review its production target.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , due to
convene on May 31, is ensuring that supplies are sufficient,
Suhail Mohammed Al Mazrouei told reporters today in  Abu Dhabi .
Global oil demand may increase by 1 million barrels a day until
it reaches 105 million a day in 2030, amid economic expansion in
 Asia  and South America, he said.  “The market is well-balanced, and there is no oversupply
in the market,” said Al Mazrouei, who last month took charge of
the ministry previously headed by Mohamed Bin Dhaen Al-Hamli.
“There is enough supply in the market,” he added.  The U.A.E. was the sixth-largest producer in OPEC last
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
organization, responsible for 40 percent of global oil supply,
will decide next month whether to adjust its collective
production ceiling of 30 million barrels a day.  Al-Mazrouei, who has managed production for five operating
companies of state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., assumed
responsibility for the energy ministry on March 12. His
predecessor, Al-Hamli, had held the position since 2004.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria,  Angola ,  Ecuador , Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
