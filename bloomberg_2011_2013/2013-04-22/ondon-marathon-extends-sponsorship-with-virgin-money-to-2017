London Marathon  organizers said
they extended a sponsorship deal with Virgin Money, a financial-
services unit of billionaire  Richard Branson ’s Virgin Group,
until at least 2017.  Financial terms weren’t disclosed in an e-mailed statement
today. Virgin Money’s previous five-year accord that began in
2010 was worth 17 million pounds ($25.9 million), race
organizers said at the time.  Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia and Kenya’s Priscah Jeptoo won
the men’s and women’s races, respectively, at the London
Marathon yesterday amid increased security after the bombing
that killed three at the Boston race.  There were 34,278 finishers. Runners wore black ribbons to
remember the Boston victims. The ballot to enter the 2014 race
opens online on April 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
