Rubber gained for a second day as
the Japanese currency slid to a four-year low against the U.S.
dollar after the Group of 20 nations supported  Japan ’s policy
stimulus.  Rubber for delivery in September gained as much as 2
percent at 258.2 yen a kilogram ($2,586 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange, before trading at 256.6 yen at 10:25
a.m. local time. Futures fell 8.4 percent last week.  The G-20 backing for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the Bank
of Japan’s stimulus signaled policy makers are counting on the
world’s third-largest economy to aid global demand as growth in
China cools. The Japanese currency has weakened 13 percent this
year, boosting an appeal of yen-denominated contracts.  The G-20 meeting’s impact on the Japanese yen is supporting
rubber prices, Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte, said by phone from  Singapore .  Rubber stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses fell 0.8
percent to 15,668 tons on April 10, according to data from the
Rubber Trade Association of Japan. Natural-rubber inventories
gained 1,764 tons to 119,149 tons, the highest since February
2010, based on a survey of nine warehouses in  Shanghai ,
Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the Shanghai Futures
Exchange said April 19.  Rubber for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 1.2 percent to 19,095  yuan  ($3,093) a ton.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.6 percent to 79 baht
($2.76) a kilogram on April 19, the lowest since October 2009,
according to Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand  data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
