The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said inspectors found an apparent safety violation at
 Scana Corp. (SCG) ’s nuclear power plant in  South Carolina .  The NRC found that the anchorage and spacing of rebar in
the floor and walls of a new unit at the V.C. Summer nuclear
station didn’t comply with code requirements, according to a
news release posted today on the agency’s website.  The NRC will hold a meeting on April 30 to discuss the
finding, which has been initially classified as having a low to
moderate safety significance, the agency said in the release.  Scana’s South Carolina Electric & Gas utility is building
two new reactors near Jenkinsville, South Carolina, about 26
miles (42 kilometers) northwest of Columbia, South Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
