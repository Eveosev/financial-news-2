Copper fell for a second straight
session in New York as lower imports into China and an
unexpected drop in U.S. home sales fueled concern that demand is
weakening in the two biggest users of the metal.  Shipments of refined copper into China in March dropped 37
percent from a year earlier, customs figures showed today.
Purchases of previously owned houses slid 0.6 percent to a 4.92
million annual rate last month, figures from the National
Association of Realtors showed today. That trailed the 5 million
rate projected in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  “China’s been the biggest buyer of raw materials for the
past several years, so if they’re slowing, we’ll be in for a
bumpy summer,” John Petrie, a senior market strategist at Zaner
Group in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Commodities
in general are in a difficult spot right now.”  Copper futures for delivery in July lost 0.6 percent to
$3.1425 a pound at 11:32 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Last
week, the price slumped 5.6 percent, entering a bear market.  The Chinese and U.S. data show demand may be weakening amid
prospects for a larger market surplus. Copper  stockpiles 
monitored by the London Metal Exchange have grown 92 percent
this year.  Supply of the metal will exceed demand by 341,000 metric
tons this year, more than last year’s 238,000 tons, and the
market will be in surplus through 2017, said Citigroup Inc.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the largest maker of mining equipment,
posted disappointing first-quarter earnings, cut its 2013
forecast and lowered “significantly” its outlook for demand
from commodities producers.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months fell 1
percent to $6,891.50 a ton ($3.14 a pound).  Aluminum, tin, lead and zinc also dropped in London, while
nickel was higher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
