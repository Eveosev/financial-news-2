Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the
world’s biggest brokerage, issued $3.65 billion of
bonds in a four-part sale.  The offering included five-year notes split between a $2.5
billion, 2.125 percent portion yielding 145 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries and a $700 million floating-
rate piece yielding 128 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The remaining portions were add-ons to existing debt due
February 2016, including $150 million of 1.75 percent notes at a
relative yield of 118 basis points and $300 million of floating-
rate debt at 105 basis points, according to Bloomberg data and a
person familiar with the transaction.  The offering is the New York-based bank’s first benchmark
dollar-denominated issue since February, Bloomberg data show.
Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million.  The bonds may be rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
said the person familiar with the transaction, who asked not to
be identified citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.
