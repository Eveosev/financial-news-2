Egypt ’s top prosecutor suspended a
provincial prosecutor for ordering a man to be lashed 80 times
for being drunk and possessing drugs, and ordered a probe into
the ruling.  Hussein Anany, a prosecutor in Matay village, in Upper
Egypt’s Minya province, will be investigated by The Judicial
Inspection Authority, the office of  Prosecutor-General  Talaat
Abdullah said in a statement today. The authority will examine
the texts on which Anany said he based his ruling, it said.  Anany assigned a policeman to lash the man, a Musicians
Syndicate member, citing the Koran and Sharia, or Islamic law,
according to the statement. Talaat canceled the order, it said.  Egypt’s new constitution has sparked criticism from secular
groups, who argue the charter extends the role of Islam in the
state. The constitution states that “the principles of
Shariah” are the main source of legislation.  Authorities issued an arrest warrant for satirist Bassem
Youssef last month after complaints over comments he made about
Islam and Mursi in his “Al Bernameg” television program. In
December, Albert Sabir, an Egyptian blogger was sentenced to
three years in jail for insulting religion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
