Asian  stocks  rose for a second day,
led by Japanese exporters as the yen slid toward a four-year low
against the dollar after the Bank of  Japan ’s stimulus policies
were unopposed at a Group of 20 meeting.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a Japanese carmaker that gets 79 percent
of sales overseas, climbed 2.6 percent.  China  Unicom Hong Kong
Ltd., the nation’s second-largest wireless carrier, jumped 4.3
percent after increasing its third-generation mobile
subscribers. PICC Property and Casualty Co., China’s biggest
non-life insurer, slipped 2.3 percent in Hong Kong after an
earthquake struck the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan
at the weekend.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.7 percent to 137.18 as
of 7:56 p.m. in  Tokyo , with more than two shares rising for each
that fell. The measure increased 5.4 percent this year through
last week amid signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering and as
Japanese equities rallied on speculation the BOJ will step up
efforts to simulate its economy.  “We’re just at the beginning of a prolonged rally in Asian
equities,” Kenneth Taubes, head of  investment management , U.S.,
for Pioneer Investments, which oversees about $249 billion, said
in a Bloomberg Television interview from  Hong Kong . “It’s a
clear path for Japan to continue with what it has previously
announced -- it’s been validated by the G-20. I’m pretty
optimistic and stocks, relative to fixed-income instruments,
look very, very attractive.”  Kuroda Emboldened  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  climbed 1.9 percent to close
at the highest since July 2008. The yen fell to a low as 90.90
per dollar, the weakest level since it declined to a four-year
low of 99.95 on April 11. A weaker currency boosts the value of
Japanese exporters’ overseas income when repatriated.  The rally in Japanese shares has added about $787 billion
in market value since mid-November as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda emerged from the G-20 meeting saying he was emboldened to
press ahead with the campaign to stimulate the economy. The
central bank meets this week after pledging April 4 to double
the monetary base in two years.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index increased 0.7 percent, while
 New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.9 percent.  South Korea ’s
 Kospi Index (KOSPI)  gained 1 percent, while  Taiwan ’s Taiex Index rose
0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 0.1 percent.  The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.1 percent after the
Sichuan province earthquake. The strongest tremor since April
2010 left 188 people dead and about 11,500 injured, according to
 China Central Television .  Relative Value  Shares on the benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at
13.9 times estimated earnings compared with 14.1 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  S&P 500 futures rose 0.6 percent today. The gauge increased
0.9 percent on April 19, paring its first monthly decline since
October, as companies from Microsoft Corp. to Chipotle Mexican
Grill Inc. posted better-than-anticipated earnings. The
combination of this month’s retreat in global equities and gains
by U.S. consumer stocks has made American companies the five
biggest in the world for the first time in eight years.  Japanese exporters advanced. Nissan climbed 2.6 percent to
1,052 yen in Tokyo.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest
carmaker, gained 1.3 percent to 5,550 yen. Canon Inc., the
world’s No. 1 camera maker, added 1.8 percent to 3,780 yen.  JTEKT Corp. jumped 11 percent to 946 yen after the Japanese

plans to hold merger talks with Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.

The company said on April 19 it increased its 3G subscribers by

and told non-emergency personnel to stay out of the disaster
zone to ease road congestion.  PICC dropped 2.3 percent to HK$9.51 in Hong Kong. China
Life Insurance Co., the nation’s biggest insurer, slid 1.9
percent to HK$20.30. Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. fell 0.8
