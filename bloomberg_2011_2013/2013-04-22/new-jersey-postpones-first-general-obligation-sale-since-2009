New Jersey  postponed until May 1
its $350 million general-obligation sale, the first such new-
money borrowing since 2009, to space out its bond deals.  Officials delayed the borrowing by a week, said  William
Quinn , spokesman for Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff. The New
Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority sold $878 million of
revenue debt last week and the New Jersey Health Care Facilities
Financing Authority issued $234 million the week before, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We wanted to give the market a little time to digest our
bonds from earlier,” Quinn said. “We thought that next week
looks like a better time.”  New Jersey, which Standard & Poor’s rates AA-, three steps
below top-graded municipals, has had a negative outlook from the
company since September because of concerns about Governor  Chris Christie ’s budget forecasts.  The state may miss revenue targets by as much as $302
million in the fiscal year ending June 30 and $335 million next
fiscal year,  David Rosen  of the nonpartisan Office of
Legislative Services told lawmakers April 4.  Competitive Sale  If S&P were to lower New Jersey’s rating, it would join
California and  Illinois  as states graded four to six levels
below top-rated muni debt. All three major credit-rating
companies have downgraded New Jersey by one level since Christie
took office in January 2010.  The general-obligation sale will price competitively.
Proceeds will help finance capital projects, according to bond
documents. The state’s last new-money general-obligation
borrowing was a $205 million sale that priced December 2009,
Bloomberg data show. New Jersey refinanced general-obligation
debt in 2010.  The $350 million sale pushed to next week will include debt
maturing from 2014 through 2033, bond documents show. Yields on
an index of 20-year general-obligation debt sold by New Jersey
and its localities were  0.24 percentage point  above benchmark
municipals with comparable maturities, near the 0.25 percentage-
point yield difference Feb. 20, the widest spread in 16 months,
Bloomberg data show.  Moody’s Investors Service rates the general-obligation sale
Aa3, comparable to S&P.  Fitch Ratings  has a similar grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
