Central banks’ efforts to bolster
their economies by printing money will eventually lose momentum,
putting more onus on governments to improve financial health,
 Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote
said.  Cote, a steering committee member for the Campaign to Fix
the Debt and an appointee to President Barack Obama’s 2010
fiscal commission, has blamed gridlock among the world’s large
democracies for impeding solutions to high debt and eroding
business confidence.  Over the next three years, Europe may have no growth and
the U.S. economy may sputter annually at 2 percent, Cote told
 Trish Regan  in a Bloomberg Television interview before a 
University of  New Hampshire  event. India may  “stay mired” at 
5 percent to 6 percent growth. China is looking better and may
expand 7 percent, he said.  “Things would be even worse” without stimulus from
central banks, Cote said in an interview. “But that runs out of
rope at some point. They are buying time, but governments need
to act.”  Companies are ready to invest if they see government
progress to solve fiscal problems, he said.  Morris Township , New
Jersey-based Honeywell has said it plans capital expenditures of
$1.2 billion this year, up $300 million from last year.  “It could be the spark of a real global renaissance
because there is a lot of money out there and there’s a lot of
businesses who want to start taking charge and doing things,”
Cote said. “There is a lot of opportunity out there, but
government needs to lead.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
