Soccer’s governing body FIFA said
Twitter accounts related to its President Sepp Blatter and the
organizers of the  World Cup  were hacked today.  Messages left on the two accounts made allegations of
corruption surrounding the award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
A group calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claimed
responsibility by signing off from both accounts.  “We can confirm that some of FIFA’s Twitter accounts,
including the account of the FIFA President and @fifaworldcup,
have been hacked today,”  FIFA  said in a statement. “In the
meantime, to avoid any doubt, we kindly ask you to verify and
check any statements that you see on a FIFA Twitter account with
the FIFA Media department.”  The Syrian Electronic Army, which says it’s sympathetic to
 Syria ’s President Bashar Assad, previously said it hacked
Twitter accounts of Qatari broadcaster Al-Jazeera and the
British Broadcasting Corp.’s Arabic Service.  The decision to select Qatar as a World Cup host followed a
controversial bidding process during which two members of FIFA’s
executive board were banned from voting after being caught in a
newspaper sting allegedly attempting to sell their votes. Qatari
officials have consistently denied any allegations of
impropriety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
