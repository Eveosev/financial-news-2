Yandex NV (YNDX)  and Mail.ru Group Ltd.
will rebound from their cheapest ever valuations as Russian
Internet advertising weathers the nation’s economic slowdown,
according to Barclays Plc.  Yandex, owner of  Russia ’s most-used search engine, tumbled
11 percent in New York last week to trade at 18 times estimated
earnings, down from a valuation of as much as 53 in 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Mail.ru, which operates Russian e-
mail, social networking and games websites, dropped 6.4 percent
in  London  to a multiple of 15.8, a record low.  The Internet companies slumped as Russia cut its 2013
growth forecast to 2.4 percent and Ksenia Yudaeva, President
 Vladimir Putin ’s representative to the Group of 20 nations, said
the energy-driven economy is probably already in recession.
Association of Communication Agencies of Russia  data  shows web
advertising grew 8.5 percent in 2009, when Russia’s economy
shrank 7.8 percent amid a 78 percent tumble in  oil prices .  “It’s a very good time to buy Yandex and Mail, it’s
probably the best entry point for the next two to three years,”
Boris Vilidnitsky, an analyst at Barclays in London who rates
both stocks the equivalent of buy, said by phone April 19. “The
market is overreacting as people fear slower economic growth in
Russia would lead to reduced advertising spending. In Russia,
Internet advertising increases even when the economy falls.”  Yandex, based in the  Hague , retreated 2.4 percent April 19
to an eight-month low of $20.10 in New York, while Moscow-based
 Mail.ru (MAIL)  rallied for the first time in six days, adding 0.5
percent today in London to $25.88.  Online Spending  Barclays is  projecting  a 76 percent jump in Yandex shares
by March 22, and a 69 percent rally for Mail.ru, according to
Vilidnitsky’s price targets based on April 19 closing levels.  Mail.ru expects companies in Russia will further increase
spending for online ads, favoring them over offline advertising,
Matthew Hammond, the company’s managing director, said on a
conference call with investors Feb. 26, according to the
transcript.  The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge, which tracks 14 of the most-
traded Russian stocks in New York, fell for the sixth week last
week, capping its longest stretch of declines since June.  Internet advertising  in Russia remained the fastest growing
segment of the market in 2012, according to the Association of
Communication Agencies of Russia, known as AKAR. Web advertising
grew 35 percent to 56.3 billion rubles ($1.8 billion) last year,
after gaining 56 percent in 2011 and 40 percent in 2010, the
data show.  ‘Good Time’  The Russian advertising market shrank 27 percent to 267
billion rubles in 2009 as the economy contracted, while online
ads increased, AKAR data show. The government cut its 2013
growth forecast from 3.6 percent as demand for commodities,
which accounted for more than 80 percent of Russian exports
revenue in 2011, decreases and prices fall. Commodities are down
6 percent this year.  Vilidnitsky said he prefers Yandex over Mail.ru because it
gets a bigger portion of its revenue from online advertising.
Yandex got at least  84 percent  of revenue every quarter since
2010 from text-based advertising, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Mail.ru got 35 percent of its 2012 revenue from the
segment, while 22 percent came from selling games and 32 percent
from social networks, he said.  “It’s a good time to buy the stock at these levels,”
Maria Shipovskikh, an analyst at Infina Investment Co., who
raised Yandex to a buy this month, said by phone from Moscow
April 16. “A slowdown in advertising spending won’t happen
immediately and Internet advertising will be least affected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
