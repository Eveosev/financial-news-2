Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) , an exploration
and production company, is looking for more opportunities in
West Africa, Global New Ventures Manager  Ian Gordon  said.  The Houston-based company would consider a stake in the
region for the right price, Gordon said in an interview in
Namibia’s capital, Windhoek.  Noble first made investments in West Africa in the 1990s
and began output with the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea,
according to the company’s  website . It expects production from
the Alen field, southeast of Alba, late this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
