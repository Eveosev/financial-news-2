Brazil swap rates fell to a two-
week low as analysts in a central bank survey lowered their
forecast for the target lending rate, adding to speculation that
increases in borrowing costs will be limited.  Swap rates due in January 2014 dropped four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.83 percent at 10:18 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the lowest level on a closing basis since April 8. The
real depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.0126 per dollar.  “The market is continuing the decompression of the swap
rate curve,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at Banco
WestLB do Brasil in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.  About 100 economists in a weekly central bank survey cut
their median year-end forecast for the target lending rate to
8.25 percent from 8.50 percent. The central bank’s board voted 6
to 2 on April 17 to raise it to 7.50 percent from a record low
7.25 percent. A survey by Bloomberg showed that 18 of 58
analysts forecast an increase of a half-percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
