Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  will hire Ken Oliver Fritz, the head of investment banking for Germany at Credit
Suisse Group AG, to become the co-head of its own German
business, according to people familiar with the situation.  Fritz will succeed Alexander Doll, who was hired by
Barclays Plc in August, the people said, asking not to be
identified before an official announcement. He’ll work alongside
Eric Fellhauer, the chief executive officer of Lazard’s German
business, they said.  Lazard, based in Hamilton,  Bermuda , saw revenue from
advising on mergers and acquisitions climb 13 percent to about
$793 million in 2012. The firm has advised on transactions
including Joh. A. Benckiser SE’s offer to buy  DE Master Blenders
1753 NV (DE)  for $10 billion and the planned merger of AMR Corp. with
U.S. Airways Group Inc.  Representatives for Lazard and Credit Suisse declined to
comment on Fritz’s appointment.  Before taking on responsibilities for investment banking
generally, Fritz was head of mergers and acquisitions for
Germany and Austria at Zurich-based Credit Suisse. He worked on
deals including a Qatar fund’s purchase of a stake in  Volkswagen
AG (VOW)  in 2009 when it agreed to combine with Porsche SE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
