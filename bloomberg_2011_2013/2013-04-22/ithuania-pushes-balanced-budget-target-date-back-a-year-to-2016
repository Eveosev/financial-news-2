Lithuania plans to balance its
budget in 2016, a year later than earlier projected, as the
country’s new government seeks to stimulate growth and jobs.  The fiscal deficit will shrink from last year’s 3.2 percent
of gross domestic product to 2.5 percent this year, 1.5 percent
in 2014 and 0.5 percent in 2015, the  Finance Ministry  in Vilnius
said in an e-mailed statement today, citing a draft of the
Baltic country’s revised European Union convergence program. A
surplus of 0.5 percent is planned in 2016, it said.  “Lithuania is committed to implementing a budget policy
that will ensure economic growth, boost employment and reduce
poverty,” the ministry said. Qualifying for euro adoption “in
the medium term” by meeting the deficit, debt and inflation
criteria in a sustainable way is also a priority, it said.  Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius’s four-party Cabinet
took office in December after elections during which the
eventual coalition members pledged to boost social spending. The
government has a goal of adopting the euro in 2015.  Under the new plan, public debt will be reduced from 40.7
percent of GDP at the end of 2012 to 34.5 percent by 2016, the
ministry said.  The deficits for this year and next were narrower by 0.5
percentage point under Lithuania’s 2012 EU convergence program,
which foresaw a balanced budget in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
