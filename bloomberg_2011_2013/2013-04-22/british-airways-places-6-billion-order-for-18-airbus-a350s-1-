British Airways parent IAG SA said
it will buy 18  Airbus SAS (EAD)  A350 wide-body planes with a list
price of almost $6 billion for the U.K. carrier.  The A350-1000 jetliners will be delivered from 2017 through
2023, according to IAG, which also secured options for 18 more
A350s for BA, together with an undisclosed number for Spanish
unit Iberia, pending an earnings turnaround there.  The contract secures a position for Airbus’s newest wide-
body at IAG after the London-based company said this month it
would exercise options to add 18 of  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s competing 787
Dreamliners in addition to 24 already on order. British Airways
needs both models to replace a fleet of aging Boeing 747 jumbos.  “The A350-1000 will bring many benefits to our fleet,”
IAG Chief Executive Officer Willie Walsh said in a statement.
“Its size and range will be an excellent fit for our existing
network and, with lower unit costs, there is an opportunity to
operate a new range of destinations profitably.”  IAG, as International Consolidated Airlines Group SA is
known, closed 1.6 percent higher at 256.40 pence before today’s
announcement. The stock has added almost 39 percent this year.  The firm orders for the Airbus and Boeing models will be
used to replace 30 of BA’s 50-plus 747s as part of a fleet-
renewal plan for the U.K. carrier’s wide-bodies that will
eventually also see the retirement of 46 Boeing 777-200s.  A380s to Come  British Airways (IAG)  will also begin taking delivery of Airbus
A380s this year, with commercial service to Los Angeles starting
Oct. 15. The unit will operate 12 of the European planemaker’s
flagship planes, with deliveries continuing through 2016.  “The A380 and the A350 are perfectly matched for greener
long-haul operations,” John Leahy, Airbus’s chief salesman
said. “This is an important announcement from one of the
world’s most respected and influential airline brands.”  British Airways is the first European carrier to commit to
the A350-1000, the largest member of the family. The deal, once
finalized, will bring the backlog for the variant to 128 units.  The fleet over-haul plan that Walsh is rolling out
effectively cuts capacity while adding frequencies.  Biggest Version  The A350-1000 -- which can seat 350 passengers in a three-
class layout -- most closely matches the capacity of a 747 among
planes BA is buying, with the carrier operating the jumbo in a
four-class setup with as many as 345 seats.  Orders for Madrid-based Iberia, which needs new long-haul
jets to replace Airbus A330s and A340s, will be firmed up “when
Iberia is in a position to grow profitably, having restructured
and reduced its cost base,” according to IAG, which is seeking
more than 3,000 job cuts at the unprofitable business.  The A350s ordered today will be powered by the Trent XWB
from  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/) , the only engine currently
available on the model and one which is guaranteed exclusivity
on the -1000 variant. Rolls-Royce said today its part of the
contract has a value of $1.6 billion, including maintenance.  The 787s being bought for British Airways will be powered
by Trent 1000 engines from the U.K. manufacturer. BA is due to
start receiving Dreamliners this year once Boeing finalizes
handover plans after the aircraft’s return to service following
battery glitches that saw it grounded on Jan. 16.  The Airbus deal announced today still requires shareholder
approval, IAG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
