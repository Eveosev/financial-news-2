Ghana ’s cedi weakened to the lowest
on record against the dollar as investors bought the U.S.
currency to send proceeds from cashed-in bonds overseas.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.97 per dollar by 3 p.m. in the
capital, Accra, the lowest since at least June 1997, when
Bloomberg began compiling the data, and a fifth day of declines.  “Offshore investors sold part of their bond investments
today,” Chris Nettey, a currency trader at the local unit of
 Standard Bank Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , said by phone. “That part of the
market was very calm, but all of a sudden, we started seeing
activity there,” he said.  The cedi has weakened 3.3 percent this year, the worst
performer against the dollar in West  Africa , after a 14 percent
slide in 2012 prompted the central bank to take measures
including boosting sales of Treasury bills to remove currency
from the market.  The benchmark 91-day rate, the second-highest in sub-
Saharan Africa after Malawi, fell less than one basis point to
22.97 percent at the latest auction on April 19. Yields on
Ghana’s $750 million Eurobonds due October 2017 dropped two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.738 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
