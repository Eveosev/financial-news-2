Investment banks may lose $17
billion of revenue in fixed income, currencies and commodities
by 2016 because of levies and regulation, according to a
Deutsche Bank AG report.  European securities firms will bear most of the erosion as
a tax on financial transactions cuts sales and trading volumes,
Deutsche Bank analysts including  Matt Spick , wrote in a note to
clients today. The next “wave” of regulation on over-the-
counter derivatives and clearing may spur smaller competitors to
exit the businesses, they said.  “We see risks that multiple regulations, especially the
financial-transaction tax, compound to deliver a sharp reduction
in FICC revenues in  Europe ,” said the analysts. “We already
see signs of shifts in market share in favor of U.S. investment
banks, and we expect this trend to continue.”  Banks including  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Deutsche
Bank and  UBS AG (UBSN)  have been curbing costs by cutting staff and
selling assets to meet tougher capital rules under Basel III
international standards as the euro area’s fiscal crisis hurts
revenue growth. The European Union in February unveiled its
proposal for a 0.1 percent financial transaction tax on stock
and bond trades and 0.01 percent on derivatives trades with ties
to participating countries.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , based in  London , is the only bank in Europe
viewed as a “potential winner” of market share, while Credit
Suisse Group AG and RBS may lose revenue from the changes,
Deutsche Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
