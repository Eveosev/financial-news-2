The yen strengthened for a second
day versus the euro and the dollar after an industry report
showed Chinese manufacturing expanded at a slower pace,
increasing demand for safer assets.  Japan ’s currency advanced at least 0.6 percent against all
16 of its major counterparts before euro-area data that
economists said will show industrial output in the region slowed
for a 21st month. The euro fell as an index of German
manufacturing declined more than economists forecast. The New
Zealand and Australian dollars declined due to the signs of
slowdown in  China , their largest trading partner  “The market has been very much positioned for risk-on
trade so the yen has become the funding vehicle of choice for
those trades,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in  Singapore . “If we’re entering into an
environment where we’re a bit more uncertain about the growth
outlook for China, therefore  Asia  more broadly, now is maybe not
the time to be piling into those types of trades.”  The yen rose 1.2 percent to 128.05 per euro at 8:47 a.m.
London time after appreciating 0.2 percent yesterday. Japan’s
currency gained 0.6 percent to 98.59 per dollar after falling to
99.95 on April 11, the weakest since April 2009. The euro
declined 0.6 percent to $1.2994.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said their China’s
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index had a preliminary reading of 50.5 in
April, compared with a final 51.6 for March. A level above 50
indicates expansion.  Chinese Growth  China’s stocks declined as the report added to an
unexpected slowdown in economic growth, reported last week, that
prompted banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to cut full-
year forecasts.  A PMI for manufacturing industries in the euro area dropped
to 46.7 in April from 46.8 the previous month, London-based
Markit Economics will say today, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. German manufacturing PMI dropped to 47.9 from 49, Markit
said. Economists had predicted it would be unchanged.  The Australian and  New Zealand  dollars declined as the
slowdown in China signaled a worsening outlook for the two
nations’ exports.  “We’re not seeing a sustained period of recovery in the
China data, which is a bit of a concern,” said David Forrester,
a senior vice president for Group of 10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “It’s a reflection
of weaker global growth, and it’s not good news for the Aussie
or the kiwi.”  Australia’s currency weakened 0.5 percent to $1.0226 after
sliding to $1.0221, the lowest since March 11. New Zealand’s
dollar fell 0.7 percent to 83.63 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
