Germany ’s finance industry
regulator Bafin will examine the businesses that banks conduct
offshore as part of efforts to crack down on tax evasion.  Companies will have to say why they operate in so-called
tax havens and who they work with, Raimund Roeseler, head of
banking supervision at Bafin, said in an interview in newspaper
Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Sven Gebauer, a spokesman for Bonn-based
Bafin, confirmed the comments.  Leaked documents  reported  in newspapers including the
Guardian concerning more than 120,000 offshore businesses and
trusts have put the spotlight on tax havens such as the Virgin
Islands and the Bahamas. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he will seek support for fighting tax evasion at
last week’s meeting of global finance chiefs in  Washington .  Roeseler also said Bafin has yet to conclude its probe into
banks’ alleged rigging of interbank borrowing rates. The
regulator will intensify its scrutiny in some areas and
investigations must determine if management board members were
responsible for wrongdoing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
