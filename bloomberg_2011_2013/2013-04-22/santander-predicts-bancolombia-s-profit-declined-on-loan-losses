Bancolombia SA (PFBCOLO) , Colombia’s largest
bank, may report a decline in first-quarter  net income  amid
rising loan delinquencies, according to Banco Santander SA.  Net income in the quarter will be 434 billion pesos, down
from 446 billion a year earlier, Santander analysts Boris Molina
and Luis Guzman estimated in a report today. Loans 90 days or
more past due may rise to 1.56 percent of the total, they wrote.  Loan-loss provisions at Medellin-based Bancolombia will
climb to 320 billion Colombia pesos ($174 million) from 198
billion a year earlier, the analysts wrote.  While lending margins stayed “relatively flat” in the
first quarter, they’re likely to contract this quarter as
interest-rate cuts take effect, the analysts wrote. They rate
the shares “underperform” with a year-end price target of
31,750 pesos.  The shares rose 0.9 percent to 30,600 pesos as of 2:42 p.m.
in Bogota. They have advanced 5.5 percent this month, the best
performance on the benchmark  Colcap index , which is down 3.3
percent in the period.  Bancolombia said April 10 it would reduce borrowing costs
on 1.6 million credit cards by 2 percentage points after Finance
Minister Mauricio Cardenas called for lenders to pass on
benchmark rate cuts to their customers. The effective annual
rate on Bancolombia’s so-called Classic, Gold and Platinum cards
fell to 28.9 percent from 30.9 percent, according to a report on
its  website .  Banco de la Republica has reduced its benchmark by 2
percentage points since July to 3.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
