Power-station coal at  China ’s
biggest shipping port for the fuel fell to the lowest price in
more than three years. Stockpiles dropped to a five-month low as
a railway for delivering the fuel conducts maintenance.  Coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories a kilogram
at Qinhuangdao slid to a range of 605  yuan  ($97.88) to 615 yuan
a ton as of yesterday, the least since Oct. 12, 2009, data from
the  China Coal Transport and Distribution Association  showed
today. Inventories declined 15 percent from a week earlier to
5.82 million metric tons, the lowest since November,  The  Daqin railway , which links Shanxi province and
Qinhuangdao and carries a third of China’s train deliveries of
coal, is conducting maintenance from April 13 to May 7. The work
affects the transport of 290,000 tons of the fuel a day,
according to the association.  China’s coal output in the first quarter dropped 1 percent
from a year earlier to 830 million tons as consumption slowed,
China Coal News  reported  April 17, citing the China Coal
Industry Association. The country’s coal use in the first three
months rose 1.5 percent to 910 million tons, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
