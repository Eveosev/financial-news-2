Mining companies seeking an
exploration license in  Ivory Coast  are required to have a
minimum investment budget of 600 million CFA francs ($1.2
million), according to a document from the Ministry of Mines,
Oil and Energy.  Investors applying for a license will need to have capital
of at least 20 million francs, while a company won’t be allowed
to submit more than three applications, according to the letter,
which was addressed to mining companies and dated April 3. The
document was obtained by Bloomberg and hasn’t been publicly
released.  Ivory Coast, French-speaking West Africa’s biggest economy,
has announced plans to review its mining code, which dates from
1995. The country produces gold, diamonds and manganese, and has
reserves of  iron ore  in the northwest.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) 
and Newcrest Mining Corp. are among the mining companies
currently operating in Ivory Coast.  A tax made on profit by gold-mining companies was approved
by parliament in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
