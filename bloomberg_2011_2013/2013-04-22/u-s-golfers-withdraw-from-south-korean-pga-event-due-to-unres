U.S.  PGA Tour  players Dustin Johnson and  Zach Johnson  withdrew from this week’s European PGA
Tour event in  South Korea  due to unrest in the region.  The Ryder Cup teammates reached the decision “following
perceived unrest on the Korean Peninsula,” tournament
organizers said on the event’s website.  North Korea fired a long-range missile in December and
carried out a nuclear weapons test in February in defiance of
tightened United Nations sanctions.  Kim Jong Un’s regime has threatened pre-emptive nuclear
strikes against its enemies, and this month pulled its workers
from an industrial complex operated jointly with the South.  The golf event is scheduled to be played at Blackstone Golf
Club, outside of Seoul. South Africa’s  Louis Oosthuizen , No. 7
in the Official World Golf Ranking, will be the highest-ranked
player in the field. Dustin Johnson is No. 19, and Zach Johnson,
the 2007 Masters champion, is ranked 30th.  The field for this week’s U.S. PGA Tour event in New
Orleans will include 14-year-old Tianlang Guan of China, two
weeks after Guan was the only amateur to make the 36-hole cut at
the Masters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
