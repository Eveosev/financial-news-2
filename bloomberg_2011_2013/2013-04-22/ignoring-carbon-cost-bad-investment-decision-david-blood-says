David Blood, who co-founded
Generation Investment Management LLP with  Al Gore , said
investors should stop giving money to companies that don’t
account for the cost of pumping carbon into the atmosphere.  “We’re still seeing businesses assume that there’s no
price on carbon,” Blood, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
executive, said today at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance
conference in New York. “Allocating capital to companies that
don’t know the price of carbon is a bad  investment decision .”  Deploying a carbon tax, opposed to implementing cap-and-
trade initiatives, would be simpler, even accounting for
economic differences between richer and poorer nations, Blood
said. Politicians in favor of such measures should be more
courageous in pressing for them, he said.  About a decade ago, many thought the capital markets alone
could solve energy issues related to  climate change , “but I
think the lesson from the last 10 years is that that’s not
accurate,” Blood said. “We have to move away from the idea
that this is a short-term economic question.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
