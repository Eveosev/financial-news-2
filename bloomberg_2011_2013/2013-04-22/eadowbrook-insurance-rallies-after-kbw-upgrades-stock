Meadowbrook Insurance Group Inc. (MIG) 
rose the most in the  Standard and Poor’s SmallCap Financials
Index  as Stifel Financial Corp.’s KBW brokerage upgraded the
company after it guarded its financial-strength rating.  Meadowbrook jumped 29 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $7.32 at
10:43 a.m. in New York. The Southfield, Michigan-based insurer
had dropped 24 percent in the 12 months through the end of last
week, compared with a 17 percent gain in the 107-company index.  The insurer was  upgraded  to outperform “based on the
stock’s current valuation and, in our view, limited downside
risk,” KBW analysts led by Robert Farnam said yesterday in a
note to investors.  Meadowbrook, led by Chief Executive Officer Robert Cubbin,
bolstered its finances by sharing risk through reinsurance and
exiting less profitable businesses, A.M. Best Co. said last
week. The ratings company affirmed its A- financial strength
grade for Meadowbrook and removed the insurer from a review that
threatened a ratings cut.  Farnam cited Best’s decision as he lifted his rating from
market perform. He raised his price target from $7 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
