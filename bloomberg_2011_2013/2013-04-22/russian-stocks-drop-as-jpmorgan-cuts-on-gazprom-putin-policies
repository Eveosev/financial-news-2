Russian  stocks  retreated, erasing
earlier gains, as  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  slid after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
cited the natural gas export monopoly’s dividend plans in a
report downgrading the country’s equities.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  sank as much as 1 percent and closed down
0.1 percent at 1,336.84 in Moscow, extending last week’s 3.4
percent drop. Gazprom fell for a sixth day, retreating 0.5
percent to 119.55 rubles as it had its longest losing streak in
more than two months. Russian equities have the cheapest
valuations on an estimated profit basis among 21  emerging
markets  tracked by Bloomberg.  Russia was cut to underweight from neutral at JPMorgan,
which said Gazprom’s proposed dividend cut, falling oil prices
and “policy stasis” in President  Vladimir Putin ’s government
overshadow low  valuations . State-run Gazprom, Russia’s largest
company by market value, proposed this month reducing its annual
dividend by about 33 percent.  “Fund manager sentiment towards Russia remains very
brittle,” Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF
Global Trading in London, said by e-mail.  The Micex Index climbed as much as 1.2 percent earlier,
advancing with European stocks after Group of 20 nations offered
no opposition to Japan’s policy stimulus, spurring optimism that
the measures will help boost a global recovery.  Brent crude 
added 0.2 percent to $99.82 a barrel in London. Oil and gas
contribute about 50 percent of Russia’s state budget revenue.  Investor Questions  “Investors point to low valuations on Russian stocks as a
bull case, but they cannot really answer our questions about
what improvements they have seen recently in the policy
environment or the expectations of future improvements,”  Adrian Mowat , JPMorgan’s chief Asia and emerging-market strategist,
wrote in a report dated April 20.  The S&P GSCI Spot Index of commodities fell 0.1 percent to
606.87. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  lost 0.6 percent to
1,329.14.  The Micex trades at 5 times estimated earnings and has lost
9.4 percent this year, compared with 10.6 times for the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) , which has slid 4.3 percent in the
period.  The  Russian Depositary Index (RDXUSD)  dropped 0.9 percent to
1,531.91. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in stock futures, rose 4.8 percent to 24.47 today. The
Market Vectors Russia ETF, the largest dedicated Russian
exchange-traded fund, declined 1 percent to 25.52, while the
 Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  declined 0.5 percent to 89.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
