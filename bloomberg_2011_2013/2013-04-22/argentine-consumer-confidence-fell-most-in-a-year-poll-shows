Consumer confidence  among
Argentines is falling at the fastest pace in a year, according
to a poll released by Buenos Aires-based Torcuato Di Tella
University.  The index, which measures expectations regarding personal
economy and macro economy as well as willingness to buy durable
goods and real estate, fell 6.1 percent this month from March to
a reading of 44.06, the poll of 1,040 people conducted April 3
to April 8 by Poliarquia Consultores showed. Confidence rose
0.5 percent from a year earlier, according to the poll, which
has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.  “It’s an important drop in the index, a result of the
government’s policies that are being felt,” Guido Sandleris,
director of the University’s Finance Research Center, said in an
e-mailed statement. “Currency controls and limits on imports
have led  Argentina  to have the smallest growth in the region in
2012.”  President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, since being re-
elected in October 2011, imposed import restrictions to maintain
a  trade surplus  and banned dollar purchases for savings to stem
capital outflows. Argentines took $21.6 billion out of the
country in 2011 and $3.4 billion in 2012. A drought, lower
demand from neighboring  Brazil  and import restrictions led South
America’s second-biggest economy to  expand  1.9 percent last
year, the least since 2009.  The outlook for personal finances fell 2.5 percent in April
from March, while macroeconomic expectations slid 2.7 percent.
Consumers’ willingness to buy durable goods such as home
appliances, automobiles and houses fell 13.2 percent, the poll
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
