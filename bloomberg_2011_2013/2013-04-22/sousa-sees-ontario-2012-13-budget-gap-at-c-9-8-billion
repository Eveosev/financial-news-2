Ontario’s deficit in the fiscal
year that ended on March 31 will be C$9.8 billion ($9.6
billion), Finance Minister Charles Sousa said.  That’s narrower than an October forecast of C$14.4 billion.
Sousa,  speaking  in Toronto, lowered the province’s 2013 growth
forecast to 1.5 percent, from 2.2 percent, and said he’s ‘fully
committed’ to balancing the budget by the 2017-18 fiscal period.  Sousa said he will deliver the 2013-14 budget on May 2 at 4
p.m.  Asked about the impact of the lower deficit on Ontario’s
debt-issuance  plans , Sousa told reporters at a press conference,
“Our borrowing is what it was in the last year,” adding “the
market has been viewing Ontario very positively.”  Sousa’s Liberal Party government holds a minority of seats
in the Ontario legislature and must win support from opposition
lawmakers to pass budgets or face a fresh election.  “Our party will not be supporting this budget no matter
what it says,” said Peter Shurman, a lawmaker from the
opposition Progressive Conservative party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
