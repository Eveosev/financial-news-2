Prime Minister  David Cameron  should
“stand up to militant trades unionists” and ban firefighters
and paramedics from striking, according to a former aide to the
U.K. premier.  Sean Worth, who worked for the  Conservative Party 
including in Cameron’s office between 2003 and 2012, published a
report today for the Policy Exchange research institute arguing
“powerful vested interests” at the top of British labor unions
are reducing the productivity and quality of state-funded
services on which vulnerable groups such as the elderly and
children rely.  The report argues that the state’s right to monopoly
provision of public services such as health care and education
should be swept aside. Private companies and voluntary groups
should be able to compete to provide services to the public and
a new legal right should be established to give voters the right
to exercise choice in the public services they consume.  “As  Margaret Thatcher  and  Tony Blair  showed, taking on
reactionary elites requires concerted political effort,” Werth
said in an e-mail. “It’s time to put the public first. People
should be able to compare, choose and switch services from an
open field of providers. In turn, the machinery of government
must shed outdated biases and embrace competition for the force
of social good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
