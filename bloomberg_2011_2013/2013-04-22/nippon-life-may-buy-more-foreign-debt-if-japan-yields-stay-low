Nippon Life Insurance Co. said it
may buy more foreign debt and cut holdings of long-term domestic
securities if yields in  Japan  stay low.  Japan’s largest life insurer may boost purchases of
domestic and foreign corporate debt in the fiscal year that
began on April 1, Hiroshi Ozeki, general manager at Nippon
Life’s investment department, told reporters today at a press
conference in Tokyo without elaborating on amounts. The company
said its real estate investments will stay unchanged while it
will marginally reduce stocks and loans.  Nippon Life is the first among major insurance companies
announcing investment plans this week, with Meiji Yasuda Life
Insurance Co. and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. briefing on April
24. The plans are a focus for analysts and investors as the
companies are traditionally large buyers of Japanese  government
bonds , particularly longer-termed securities.  Kenji Matsuo, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of
Japan, said it’s hard to buy low-yielding government bonds in a
volatile market. Overseas bonds would be an alternative
investment, he told reporters on April 19.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  announced its plan on April 4 to double
its holdings of sovereign debt in the next two years to end
deflation, triggering a drop in 30-year bond yields to a record
0.925 percent the next day.  Price volatility  for the nation’s
bonds climbed to 3.33 percent today based on a 60-day reading,
the highest since August 2008.  Yields, Yen  The  yield  on the 10-year JGB rose 2 1/2 basis points today
to 0.61 percent, almost double the record low of 0.315 percent
on April 5, and the 30-year rate jumped 7 1/2 basis points to
1.6 percent from the close on April 19. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average gained 1.9 percent to 13,568.37, the highest since July
2008. The yen slid 0.3 percent to 99.80 per dollar as of 5:55
p.m. in Tokyo.  Nippon Life expects the yen to be at 98 per dollar and 127
against the euro at the end of fiscal 2013. The yield on Japan’s
10-year bond will be around 0.6 percent and the  Nikkei 225  is
likely to be at 13,500 over the same time period, the company
said.  Japanese life insurers may boost purchases of overseas debt
with mid- and long-term maturities to as much as 500 billion yen
($5 billion) per month, according to Satoshi Igarashi, the
Tokyo-based senior portfolio strategist at BNP Paribas SA.
That’s an increase from about 300 billion yen per month in 2012,
according to Ministry of Finance data.  Even so, recent data has shown that Japanese investors
 reduced  holdings of overseas bonds in the seven days ended April
12 for a fifth week. They sold a net 2.56 trillion yen of such
securities during those weeks, according to Ministry of Finance
figures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
