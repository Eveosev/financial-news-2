New York  Federal Reserve Bank
President William C. Dudley said European economic weakness and
U.S. budget woes mean “more needs to be done” to shore up the
global economy and financial regulation.  “In the United States, the good news is that the economic
outlook appears to be gradually improving,” Dudley said today
in remarks to a conference in New York. “For Europe, the near-
term macroeconomic outlook seems less bright.”  Dudley said U.S. fiscal policy is not “well-calibrated”
to current challenges. For Europe, moving toward banking union
is a “critically important next step” to emerge from the
sovereign debt crisis.  “It would underscore the fact that a euro is a euro and
will remain a euro throughout  Europe , reducing perceptions of
redenomination risk,” Dudley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
