West Texas Intermediate crude rose
to a one-week high as the Group of 20 nations approved of
 Japan ’s stimulus program, bolstering speculation that fuel
demand will climb in the third-biggest oil-consuming nation.  Futures advanced 0.9 percent after G-20 finance chiefs
backed the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s plan to buy 7 trillion yen ($70
billion) of bonds a month. The market retreated earlier as a
report from the National Association of Realtors showed
 purchases  of previously owned U.S. houses fell in March. The
United Arab Emirates’ energy minister said today that he
considers global oil markets to be “well-balanced.”  “The Japanese stimulus effort is adding a positive spin to
the market,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division
at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “You are seeing a
risk-on move in the all of the markets. Quantitative easing
programs elsewhere have already given the oil market a boost,
and this will do the same.”  WTI oil for May delivery climbed 75 cents to $88.76 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since April 12. Prices slipped 3.6 percent last week.
May futures expired today. The more-active June contract rose 92
cents to settle at $89.19. The volume of all futures traded was
16 percent below the 100-day average for the time of day at 3:03
p.m.  Brent crude  for June settlement rose 74 cents, or 0.7
percent, to end the session at $100.39 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The volume of all futures
traded today was 8.9 percent lower than the 100-day average.  The front-month European benchmark grade contract traded at
a premium of $11.20 to June WTI.  Washington Meeting  At a meeting in  Washington  late on April 19, G-20 finance
chiefs and central bankers praised the measures taken by the BOJ
this month aimed at increasing inflation to 2 percent within two
years. They signaled Japan’s focus on supporting domestic demand
was strong enough to allow them to ignore the side effects on
their own economies of a sliding yen.  Oil in New York has surged since touching $32.40 on Dec.
19, 2008, as the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on three rounds
of bond purchases, called quantitative easing, to stimulate the
nation’s economy.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained 0.6 percent while
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 0.2 percent. The  S&P
500  fell 2.1 percent last week, its biggest drop since November.  “Oil is primarily up because of the strong rebound of the
S&P 500,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research
at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It makes sense
that we would be gaining anyway after the big drop last week.”  Home Sales  Sales of previously owned U.S. houses, tabulated when a
contract closes, fell 0.6 percent to a 4.92 million annual rate
last month. They were projected to increase to a 5 million rate,
according to the median forecast of 75 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The February pace of sales was revised to 4.95
million from a previously reported 4.98 million, the Washington-
based industry group said.  “The home sales numbers were obviously negative for the
market,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a
New York energy hedge fund. “The worries about demand that sent
us lower last week aren’t going away.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ,
scheduled to convene on May 31, is ensuring that supplies are
sufficient, U.A.E. Energy Minister Suhail Mohammed Al Mazrouei
told reporters today in Abu Dhabi.  “The market is well-balanced, and there is no oversupply
in the market,” Al Mazrouei said. “There is enough supply in
the market.”  $100 Barrel  Crude will trade at $100 a barrel in the third quarter
after a second-quarter correction driven by oversupply and a
fall in stock markets, Saad Al-Kuwari, the chief executive
officer of Qatar International Petroleum Marketing Co., or
Tasweeq,  said today in  Abu Dhabi .  Money managers reduced net-long positions, or  wagers  that
West Texas Intermediate will increase, by 6.8 percent in the
week ended April 16, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  Net-long positions in WTI held by money managers, including
 hedge funds , commodity pools and commodity-trading advisers,
declined by 13,298 futures and options combined to 183,032, the
least since the week ended March 19, the CFTC report showed. It
was the biggest drop since the period ended Feb. 26.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 23.5 percent, down from 24.8 percent April 19.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 390,726
contracts as of 3:03 p.m. It totaled 527,509 contracts April 19,
10 percent lower than the three-month average. Open interest was
1.75 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
