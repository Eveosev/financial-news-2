President  Barack Obama  has invited
all 20 women serving in the Senate to a dinner at the White
House tomorrow as part of the administration’s efforts to
improve relations with Congress.  The private meal, disclosed on the president’s schedule,
comes less than a week after the president dined with a dozen
Democratic senators. The group discussed immigration, the
economy and the need to reach a budget compromise. Obama has
also hosted recent dinners with Senate Republicans and traveled
to Congress to meet with lawmakers from both parties.  The 20 women in the 100-member Senate are the most in U.S.
history. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of  New York  wrote
on Twitter Inc.’s social messaging service that she suggested to
Obama last year that inviting the women senators to the White
House would be “a good step toward bipartisan cooperation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
