China Vanke Co. (3333) , the nation’s
biggest developer, reported a 16 percent jump in first-quarter
profit as sales of smaller homes defied government curbs.  Net income  climbed to 1.61 billion  yuan  ($260 million),
from 1.4 billion yuan a year earlier, the company said in a
filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange. Revenue gained 35 percent
to 14 billion yuan. Vanke was expected to report profit of 1.63
billion yuan, based on the mean estimate of two analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  About 90 percent of Vanke’s projects sold were homes of
smaller than 144 square meters (1,550 square feet), the company
said. That helped it boost sales from buyers who bought homes
for self-use even as the government last month implemented the
toughest property measures in a year by ordering the central
bank to raise down-payment requirements and  interest rates  for
second mortgages in cities with excessive price gains.  Vanke, with 51 billion yuan of cash as of the end of March
31, will look for land acquisition opportunities, according to
the statement.  The Shenzhen-based developer’s contracted sales, based on
bookings of apartments before they are built, rose 41 percent to
43.7 billion yuan in the first three months, the company said.
Developers in  China  typically sell homes before construction
begins and book earnings from sales progressively.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
