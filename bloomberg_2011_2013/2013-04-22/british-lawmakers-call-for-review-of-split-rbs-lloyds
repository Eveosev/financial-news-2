U.K. lawmakers have recommended the
Treasury conduct a review into the advantages and disadvantages
of splitting up state-owned  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  and
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc. (LLOY)   “Such an analysis should include an examination of the
fiscal and competition implications, and be completed by the
time of the announcement of the government’s spending review in
June,” the Treasury Select Committee in London led by  Andrew Tyrie  said in an April 20 report published on its website.  The request comes a month after  Bank of England  Governor
Mervyn King urged the government to split RBS, Britain’s largest
publicly owned lender, into a so-called good bank that could
fund itself and a bad bank, where unprofitable assets would be
transferred. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has
called such a move impractical and disruptive.  “If we had thought that breaking up RBS was a practical
proposition, we would have done it,” Osborne said in December.
“Do you go back in, disrupt everything and try and rip out of
RBS the bad assets? Try and value them? That would take a long
time in order to achieve something in the future.”  RBS and Lloyds were both bailed out by the U.K. taxpayer
during the global financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
