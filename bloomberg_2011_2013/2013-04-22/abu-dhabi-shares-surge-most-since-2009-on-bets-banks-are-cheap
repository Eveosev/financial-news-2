Abu Dhabi’s shares climbed the most
since December 2009, led by banks, on investor speculation the
shares are cheap relative to regional peers.  First Gulf Bank PJSC, (FGB)  controlled by the emirate’s ruling
family, jumped 3.8 percent, leading gains in the benchmark
index. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC gained the most this
month. The  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  advanced 1.8 percent to 3,153.03 at
the close in the emirate. Abu Dhabi’s banking index trades at an
average of 9.6 times estimated earnings compared with 10.7 times
for members of the Bloomberg GCC 200 Financial Index.  “Banks in the United Arab Emirates are doing well,” said
Walid Mourad, Dubai-based fund manager at ING Investment
Management Middle East Ltd. “They are trading below their book
value, and are the cheapest compared to peers in the region. The
cost of funding of these banks is stabilizing, and provisions
are not expected to increase further.”  U.A.E. banks are showing signs of recovery after the global
credit crisis weakened lending, crimped investment banking and
spurred loan defaults. First Gulf Bank’s first-quarter profit
may have climbed 15 percent to 1.08 billion dirhams ($294
million), according to the mean estimate of five analysts on
Bloomberg.  First Gulf Bank climbed to 15.05 dirhams.  Abu Dhabi
Commercial Bank, (ADCB)  the third-biggest U.A.E. lender by assets,
increased 3.1 percent, the most since March 28, to 4.29 dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
