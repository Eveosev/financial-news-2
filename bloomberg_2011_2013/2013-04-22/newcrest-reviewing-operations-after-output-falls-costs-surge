Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s
largest gold producer, said it’s reviewing its business
activities as it reported a 3.3 percent drop in third-quarter
output amid rising costs and falling prices.  “Operating and capital costs overall continue to be high
in the global gold mining industry,” the Melbourne-based
company said today in a statement. “Newcrest continues to
review all of its business activities, particularly those
related to higher cost,” it said, noting that its 50 percent-
owned Hidden Valley operation churned out gold at a cash cost
that’s higher than current  gold prices .  Lower production and a falling metal price mean Newcrest is
expected to report a 45 percent drop in earnings in the year
ending June 30, according to the mean of 15 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Gold this month slumped to its lowest in
two years and was trading at $1,426.61 an ounce as of 9:13 a.m.
Melbourne time.  Production in the three months ended March 31 fell to
514,421 ounces from 532,237 ounces a year earlier, Newcrest said
today. That missed the median estimate of 530,500 ounces from
six analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Hidden Valley, which accounts for about 4 percent of
output, produced 18,988 ounces in the quarter at a cash cost of
A$1,790 ($1,838) an ounce and total cost of A$2,268 an ounce, it
said. That takes the group’s total cost to A$1,086 an ounce.  Hidden Valley  “As stated previously, the production and cost performance
at Hidden Valley is unacceptable and a structured program to
improve performance and assess the future of this operation is
continuing with considerable focus,” Newcrest said. “The
primary improvement action is installation of a primary
crusher,” with completion anticipated next month.  Newcrest rose 2.2 percent to A$17.01 in Sydney trading
yesterday. The shares have dropped 39 percent in the past year,
giving it a market value of A$13 billion.  The company on March 28 cut its annual production target by
more than 10 percent to a range of 2 million ounces to 2.15
million ounces, mainly because of lower production at its Lihir
mine in  Papua New Guinea  and the Gosowong mine in  Indonesia .
Newcrest produced 2,285,917 ounces of gold in the previous year.  Gold has dropped 15 percent in 2013 after rising sixfold in
a 12-year rally through last year. Bullion touched $1,321.95 on
April 16 in the  spot market , the lowest since January 2011, on
speculation central banks in  Europe  may sell holdings to raise
funds and after data showed  China’s economy  grew less than
estimated.  The metal is forecast to average $1,707 an ounce this year,
according to estimates compiled on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
