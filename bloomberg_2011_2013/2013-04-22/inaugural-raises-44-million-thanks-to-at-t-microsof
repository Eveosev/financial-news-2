Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , whose employees
gave more money to President  Barack Obama ’s re-election
committee than those at any other company, was the second-
largest donor to his January inauguration, contributing $2.1
million, according to new  Federal Election Commission  filings.  Meanwhile, as the two parties gear up to battle for control
of Congress in next year’s election, the House and Senate
fundraising committees for Democrats brought in more money than
their Republican counterparts during 2013’s first three months.  Obama’s inaugural committee raised more than $44 million,
much of it from corporations in a reversal of his 2009 policy.
The largest contributor to his 2013 swearing-in festivities was
 AT&T Inc. (T) , which gave $4.6 million.  Boeing Co. (BA)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) 
each donated $1 million.  Obama’s first inaugural committee raised more than $54
million from individuals only.  Other corporate donors to this year’s committee included
Genentech Inc., which gave $750,000; the  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , which
contributed $430,000; and  Bank of America Corp ., which donated
$300,000. Bank of America also contributed $5 million to help
stage the Democratic convention in its home city of Charlotte,
North Carolina.  Timothy Gill, the founder of Denver-based Quark Software
Inc., was a $500,000 donor. Gill established a foundation to
fund efforts to secure equal rights for gay, lesbian, bisexual
and transgender people.  Switching Allegiances  Some donors who supported Republicans in the elections
switched partisan allegiances for the inauguration.  Obama’s committee received $100,000 from Rod Aycox, whose
Alpharetta, Georgia-based loan company, Select Management
Resources LLC, was one of several auto-title and payday lenders
contributing to Restore Our Future, the super-political action
committee that supported Republican nominee  Mitt Romney . Payday
lenders are subject to federal oversight under the Dodd-Frank
financial regulation law that Romney during the campaign vowed
to repeal.  Aycox and his foundation separately gave $200,000 to the
super-PAC. He didn’t return a phone call seeking comment.  Obama’s inaugural committee also received support from
organized labor, including the Teamsters, which gave $250,000,
and the American Postal Workers Union, which donated $100,000.  Microsoft Employees  Employees of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and their
families contributed $814,645 to Obama’s 2012 re-election, more
than those working at any other company, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group that
tracks campaign contributions.  AT&T’s political action committee contributed $5,000 to
Romney’s campaign and its chairman,  Randall Stephenson , gave
$30,800 to the Republican National Committee. Those donations
came after the Obama administration rejected the proposed AT&T-
T-Mobile Inc. merger.  Claudia Jones, a spokeswoman for AT&T, and Christina
Pearson, a Microsoft spokeswoman, both had no immediate comment.  Chicago-based Boeing received $22.1 billion in federal
contracts in fiscal year 2011, second only to  Lockheed Martin
Corp. (LMT) , according to a Bloomberg Government study. AT&T, based in
Dallas, ranked 91st with $744.4 million in government contracts
and Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, was 104th with
$661.5 million, according to the study.  Memphis, Tennessee-based  FedEx Corp., (FDX)  which ranked 40th
with $1.6 billion in federal contracts, contributed $500,000 to
the inaugural committee.  2014 Midterm  As attention turns to the 2014 midterm election, the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said it raised $13.7
million, almost double the $6.8 the National Republican
Senatorial Committee said it took in. Republicans need to expand
their numbers by six to gain the chamber’s majority, and of the
35 Senate races on the ballot next year, Democrats hold all 10
of the seats rated as competitive by Washington-based analyst
 Charlie Cook .  The DSCC entered April with $8.4 million in the bank,
compared with $5.3 million for the Republicans. The Senate
Democratic committee was $15 million in debt at the end of
February while the Senate Republicans owed $9.5 million at the
end of March.  House Races  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which aids
the party’s House candidates, brought in $22.6 million from Jan.
1 to March 31, while its counterpart, the  National Republican
Congressional Committee , raised $17.5 million, according to
filings with the Federal Election Commission.  The Democratic committee entered April with $8.9 million to
spend, compared with $8.1 million for the Republicans. The NRCC
reported more debt, $8.3 million, to $4.5 million for the
Democratic group.  Democrats need a net pickup of 17 seats to take back the
majority it lost to the Republicans in 2010.  The  Republican National Committee , which owed $21 million
at the end of 2010, raised $18.3 million from January to March
and reported being debt-free, according to its FEC filing. The
party committee had $8.7 million in the bank.  Its Democratic counterpart reported raising $13.9 million,
with debts of $22.6 million. The  Democratic National Committee 
entered April with $5.9 million cash on hand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
