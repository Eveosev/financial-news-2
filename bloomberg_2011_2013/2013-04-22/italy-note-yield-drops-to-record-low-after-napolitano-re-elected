Italy ’s government bonds advanced,
pushing the two-year note yield to a record low, amid
speculation re-elected president Giorgio Napolitano will take
the lead in trying to end the nation’s political gridlock.  Italy’s 15-year yield dropped to the lowest in more than
six years. Portuguese and Spanish bonds also climbed as
Napolitano, 87, prepares to be sworn in for a second seven-year
term. He could begin consultations on a new government as soon
as tomorrow, eight weeks after inconclusive elections. German
bunds rose even as a report showed  consumer confidence  in the
euro region unexpectedly increased in April.  “We have a re-elected president in Italy and the chance
for new players in the government formation,” said Rainer Guntermann, a rates strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .
“This should support Italian bonds and in the wake of that,
probably Spain. Spread tightening can continue versus bunds.”  Italy’s  two-year yield  fell 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 1.24 percent at 4:32 p.m. London time,
after dropping to 1.208 percent, the lowest level since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1993. The 6 percent
security due November 2014 rose 0.145, or 1.45 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,303) face amount, to 107.315.  The nation’s 15-year yield dropped as much as 14 basis
points to 4.23 percent, the lowest since December 2006.  The rate on the 10-year bond fell 15 basis points to 4.08
percent, after reaching 4.06 percent, the least since Jan. 25.
That pushed the additional yield, or spread, investors demand to
hold the Italian securities over similar-maturity bunds to as
low as 280 basis points, the narrowest since Feb. 25.  Italian Election  Italian elections on Feb. 24-25 failed to select an
outright winner, pushing 10-year yields to the highest since
November. Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, who won a
partial victory, was unable to strike post-vote alliances and
resigned after he was ultimately deserted by allies in the
presidential ballot.  His exit increases the chances that Napolitano can convince
the remnants of the Democrats to join a coalition with  Silvio
Berlusconi ’s People of Liberty party to end the stalemate.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Italy and  Portugal , according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Portuguese Yields  The rate on 10-year Portuguese debt tumbled 19 basis points
to 5.88 percent, while that on similar-maturity Spanish bonds
slid 12 basis points to 4.50 percent, the lowest since November
2010.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield fell two basis points to 1.23
percent. The rate fell to 1.20 percent on April 5, the  least 
since July 24.  The spread between Spanish and Italian 10-year yields
widened to 43 basis points, the most since Feb. 26 as a report
today showed the Iberian nation’s budget deficit was the largest
in the European Union last year.  The European Union’s statistics agency Eurostat today
reported  Spain ’s deficit widened to 10.6 percent of gross
domestic product last year, ahead of  Greece ’s 10 percent of GDP
gap, swollen by the cost of bailing out its banking system. That
compares with 9.4 percent in 2011.  The yield on Greek bonds in due February 2023 slipped two
basis points to 11.48 percent.  An index of  household confidence  in the 17-nation euro bloc
rose to minus 22.3 from minus 23.5 in March, the European
Commission in Brussels said today. Economists had forecast a dip
to minus 24, according to the median of 29 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Italian bonds returned 2.8 percent this year through April
19, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
earned 5.6 percent and German debt gained 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
