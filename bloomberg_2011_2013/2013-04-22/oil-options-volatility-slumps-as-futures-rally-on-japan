U.S. crude-oil options volatility
slumped as the underlying futures rallied to a one-week high on
speculation that approval of  Japan ’s stimulus program will
bolster fuel demand in the third-biggest oil-consuming nation.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 23.48 percent at 3:45 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 24.77 percent on April 19.  West Texas Intermediate oil for May delivery climbed 75
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $88.76 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement since April 12. May
futures expired today. The more-active June contract rose 92
cents to settle at $89.19.  The futures advanced after Group of 20 finance chiefs
backed the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s plan to buy 7 trillion yen ($70
billion) of bonds a month. The plan is aimed at increasing
inflation to 2 percent within two years.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $85 puts, which slid 45 cents to 82 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,726 contracts at 3:50 p.m. June $75 puts were the
second-most active, dropping 8 cents to 7 cents on volume of
3,245 lots.  Puts, or bets that crude futures will fall, accounted for
59 percent of electronic trading volume today. Bullish bets, or
calls, made up 58 percent of the 116,485 contracts on April 19.  June $98 calls were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 17,081 contracts changing hands. They
dropped 1 cent to 10 cents a barrel. July $94 calls increased 1
cent to 42 cents a barrel on 8,641 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $80 puts with 38,459
contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 36,036 contracts
and June $85 puts with 35,497.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
