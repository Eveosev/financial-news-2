Italy ’s budget deficit fell last
year to the European Union limit for the first time since 2008
as austerity policies offset the effects of the longest
recession in more than two decades, official EU figures showed.  The shortfall declined to 3 percent of gross domestic
product from 3.8 percent in 2011, Eurostat statistics office
said in a report today. The country’s debt reached 127 percent
of GDP, Eurostat said.  As Italy borrows to contribute to bailouts and pay arrears
to suppliers, the nation’s debt will rise to 130.4 percent in
2013, outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government forecast
earlier this month. The budget deficit will drop to 2.9 percent,
putting Italy below the EU’s 3 percent limit, an April 10 report
by the Treasury said. The report also said the region’s third-
biggest  economy  will shrink 1.3 percent in 2013, before
expanding by the same amount next year.  Italian government bonds advanced, pushing the 10-year
yield to the lowest since January, amid expectations re-elected
president Giorgio Napolitano will succeed in ending the nation’s
two months of political gridlock. The yield fell 10 basis points
to 4.12 percent as of 10:50 a.m. in  Rome .  Italy may need as much as 7 billion euros in additional
spending cuts this year to meet its deficit goal, said Finance
Undersecretary Gianfranco Polillo in an April 15 interview.  -- Editors: Andrew Davis, Jerrold Colten  To contact the reporter on this story:
