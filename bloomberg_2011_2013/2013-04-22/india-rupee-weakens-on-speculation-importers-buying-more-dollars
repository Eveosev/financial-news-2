India ’s rupee dropped from near a
seven-week high on speculation importers are stepping up dollar
purchases to pay month-end bills.  The currency won’t move much from current levels as a glut
in inflows accumulated due to holidays will offset demand for
the greenback, according to Andhra Bank. Markets were shut April
19 and will close again April 24 for the Mahavir Jayanti
celebrations. Concerns about India’s current-account deficit
have eased after brent crude slipped 9 percent this month and
gold fell 11 percent. The nation is the world’s biggest bullion
importer and fourth-largest consumer of oil.  “The rupee will be rangebound,” said Vikas Babu, a trader
at state-run Andhra Bank in Mumbai. “After the initial positive
view on the commodity price drop, investors are now getting
cautious as the outlook on the global economy is still hazy and
could impact capital inflows.”  The rupee declined 0.1 percent from April 18 to 54.0450 per
dollar as of 9:48 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 53.7725 on April 17, the strongest level
since Feb. 28. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.61 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.03 per
dollar, compared with 54.93 on April 19, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
54.78 versus 54.74. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
