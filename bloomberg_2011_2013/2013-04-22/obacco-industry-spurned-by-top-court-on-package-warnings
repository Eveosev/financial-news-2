The U.S. Supreme Court turned away
a tobacco industry challenge to a federal law that requires
bigger, graphic health warnings on cigarette packages and
imposes new marketing restrictions.  The justices today left intact a lower court ruling that
said the 2009 measure didn’t violate the free-speech rights of
tobacco companies. The cigarette makers challenging the law
included  Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) ’s R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and
a  Lorillard Inc. (LO)  subsidiary.  The law requires that half of the front and back panels of
cigarette packages be devoted to warnings. The measure also
instructed the  Food and Drug Administration  to develop color
graphics that would become part of the warnings.  In addition, the law sets out rules governing the use of
the words “light” and “low” in product descriptions and
limits promotional practices including event sponsorships.  The appeal before the high court didn’t directly challenge
the nine graphic images selected by the FDA to be placed on
cigarette packages and advertisements. Those images included a
man expelling cigarette smoke from a hole in his throat,
diseased lungs and a cadaver.  A separate federal appeals court blocked the FDA’s proposed
images, and the Obama administration chose to come up with a new
approach rather than appeal to the  Supreme Court .  The case acted on today is American Snuff v. United States,
12-521.  To contact the reporter on this story:
