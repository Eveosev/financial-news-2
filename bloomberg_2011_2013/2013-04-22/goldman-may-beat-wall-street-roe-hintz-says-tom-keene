Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the Wall
Street bank that generates the highest percentage of revenue
from trading, may be able to post a higher return on equity than
competitors, according to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co. analyst.  Goldman Sachs could generate ROE, a measure of how well the
bank reinvests shareholder money, of 15 percent to 20 percent,
Hintz said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with  Tom Keene .  That would make the New York-based company an “outlier”
among the biggest banks and Wall Street firms, which probably
will generate ROE of about 12 percent to 15 percent, Hintz said.
Banks will continue to trim compensation in an effort to boost
returns, Hintz said.  The firm’s  annualized ROE  was 12.4 percent in the first
quarter, above the 10.7 percent it reported for all of 2012.
Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last week that the
firm doesn’t have enough information about pending regulations
to provide a new target, which was set at a 20 percent return on
tangible equity before the financial crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
