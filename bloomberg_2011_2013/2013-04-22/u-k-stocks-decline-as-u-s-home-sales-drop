U.K. stocks declined as a report
showed sales of previously owned U.S. houses unexpectedly
dropped in March.  The FTSE 100 Index fell 0.2 percent to 6,274.19 at 3:16
p.m. in  London . The benchmark gauge lost 1.5 percent last week
as commodities fell amid worse-than-forecast economic data from
 China  and the U.S. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also slipped
0.2 percent today, while Irelandâ€™s ISEQ Index added 0.4 percent.  In the U.S., purchases of previously owned houses fell 0.6
percent to a 4.92 million annual rate last month, figures from
the National Association of Realtors showed. The median forecast
of 75 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected sales would
increase to a 5 million rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
