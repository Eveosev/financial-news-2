Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJAL)  flights
and telephone services in the kingdom were disrupted after a
fiber optic network was cut by “unidentified people” in Amman,
officials said.  The network of about 40 cables, which connects Jordan to
other countries, was severed from two sides, Nader Thneibat,
secretary general of the Ministry of Information and
Communications Technology, said in a phone interview today.  Some 11 Royal Jordanian flights to  Europe  and the U.S. were
delayed due to the Internet outage, Basel Kilani, the airlines
executive assistant to the president for media and
communication, said by phone. The airline was unable to
communicate with control centers in Europe and the U.S., Kilani
said, and is working on a solution.  The cables were cut in Amman around 10 p.m. yesterday,
according to a statement from  Jordan Telecom (JTEL)  Co. PSC, which owns
the network. Landline telephones and some mobile services were
also affected, the statement said.  Work is under way to fix the damage and Internet services
are slowly being restored, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
