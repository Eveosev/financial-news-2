Michael Weiss, the former head of
Morgan Stanley’s China mergers advisory unit, joined Shanghai
International Group Co.’s Sailing Capital Management, a person
with knowledge of the matter said.  Weiss, who left Morgan Stanley earlier this month, was
named partner and will help the Chinese private-equity fund
manage 12 billion  yuan  ($1.9 billion), focusing on overseas
investments, said the person, asking not to be identified
because the appointment hasn’t been announced. He will be based
in  Hong Kong , the person said.  Weiss, 44, is joining Sailing Capital after a record 27
percent drop in the value of Chinese private-equity deals last
year, according to data from Asian Venture Capital Journal.
Shanghai International, the biggest shareholder of  Shanghai
Pudong Development Bank (600000)  Co., was founded in 2000 and is backed
by the city’s government.  Yu Hong, an executive at Sailing Capital, didn’t return two
calls to her office seeking comment. Weiss also held investment
banking positions at Credit Suisse Group AG from 2008 to 2010
and had worked for Citigroup Inc. in  New York  and Hong Kong for
almost a decade.  Chinese private-equity deals last year declined to 473
transactions valued at $21.9 billion, according to the Asian
Venture Capital Journal, which tracks the industry. Domestic
initial public offerings, used by private-equity firms to exit
investments, tumbled 70 percent in 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
