Rutgers University will introduce
its next men’s basketball coach today at a news conference.  Eddie Jordan, a Los Angeles Lakers assistant coach and a
former Scarlet Knights player, has agreed to take the job,
according to the Star-Ledger of  Newark .  The hiring will come 20 days after Mike Rice was fired for
physically and verbally abusing players in a scandal that also
cost Athletic Director Tim Pernetti his job.  Jordan, who played for New Brunswick, New Jersey-based
Rutgers from 1973-77, agreed to coach the Scarlet Knights on
April 19. The move wasn’t official until the school’s board of
governors met to approve the hiring, the Star-Ledger reported.  Rice was fired three months after being fined $50,000 and
suspended for three games by Pernetti based on video that showed
him hurling basketballs, profanities and gay slurs at his
players during practices from 2010-12.  The video was aired by ESPN’s “Outside the Lines” program
on April 2, leading to Rice’s firing the following day,
Pernetti’s resignation on April 5 and calls for school president
Robert Barchi to step down as well.  Jordan has been a National Basketball Association head
coach for the Sacramento Kings, Washington Wizards and
Philadelphia 76ers. He became a Lakers assistant in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
