Qatar National Bank SAQ plans to
sell dollar bonds as the first Arab lender with assets  exceeding
$100 billion  pursues acquisitions.  The initial price guidance has been set at the 3.125
percent area on the proposed seven-year bonds that may be sold
as early as today, said two people familiar with matter, who
asked not be identified because the details are private.
Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Standard Chartered Plc, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Qatar
National Bank are the book-runners.  The Doha-based lender said in December it will pay $1.97
billion for 77 percent of Egyptian unit of Societe Generale SA,
part of a plan to more than double the ratio of profit it
derives from global operations by 2017. Qatar National Bank has
also sold debt denominated in Swiss francs, euros and Hong Kong
dollars this year.  The lender last sold dollar-denominated bonds in November
when it raised $1 billion. The yield on the 2.125 percent 2018
notes has climbed nine basis points since the bonds started
trading to 2.38 percent at 12:44 p.m. in Dubai, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Qatar National Bank  reported a 7 percent  increase in first-
quarter profit. The bankâ€™s assets rose to 308 billion riyals
($104 billion) at the end of March, making it the biggest bank
in the  Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
