Sugar fell in  New York  after the
commodity failed to rally even as speculators closed out bets on
lower prices. Cocoa advanced.  While investors cut wagers on lower sugar prices by 26
percent in the week to April 16, prices gained 0.8 percent in
the period. Bets on falling prices reached a record in the
previous seven-day period, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  data  compiled by Bloomberg show. While funds bought
futures, traders sold,  Michael McDougall , head of the Brazil
desk at Newedge Group in New York, said by e-mail April 19.  It “was a surprise to see the funds cover so much of their
gross short with very little fanfare,” McDougall said. “In the
end, the market rallied all of 15 points.”  Raw sugar for July delivery slid 1.5 percent to 17.62 cents
a pound by 5:54 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. White
sugar for August delivery was down 0.7 percent to $505.10 a
metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Large and small speculators excluding  index funds  reduced
their net-short position in raw sugar by 30,535 contracts to
85,146 lots, data from the Washington-based commission showed.
The new position of funds is “easing some of the technical
short-covering tension in the market,”  James Kirkup , a broker
at ABN Amro Markets U.K. Ltd., said by e-mail today.  Raw sugar for May delivery was 0.13 cent a pound more
expensive than the futures for July. That is down from a premium
of 0.24 cent a pound a week ago. The May futures expire on April
30 and the exchange will announce the delivery the next day.  Port Strikes  “The May expiry is only eight days away, with speculation
centered on whether center south Brazils will be delivered,”
Tom McNeill, a director at Brisbane, Australia-based researcher
Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty, said in a report e-mailed
today, referring to sugar from the biggest growing region in top
producer  Brazil . “That seems risky for all parties given low
volumes produced and port strikes, aside from weather.”  Cocoa futures for July delivery rose 0.2 percent to $2,338
a ton on ICE. Futures for the same month were 0.1 percent higher
at 1,557 pounds ($2,372) a ton on NYSE Liffe, and earlier today
rose 0.4 percent to 1,561 pounds, the highest price for a most-
active contract since Dec. 5.  Arabica-coffee futures for delivery in July slid 0.3
percent to $1.428 a pound in New York. Robusta-coffee futures
for delivery in July gained 0.1 percent to $2,093 a ton in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
