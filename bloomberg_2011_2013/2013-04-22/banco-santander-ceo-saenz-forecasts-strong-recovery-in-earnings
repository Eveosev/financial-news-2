Banco Santander (SAN)  SA Chief Executive
Officer Alfredo Saenz said Spain’s biggest bank expects a
“strong recovery” in earnings over the next three or four
years as it enters a “new cycle” of profitability.  “We are very close to completing the reinforcement of our
balance sheet and entering a new  results  cycle,” Saenz said at
a banking seminar in Madrid today. “We expect the strong
recovery of our results over the next three or four years.”  Santander has bolstered its  balance sheet  since 2008 by
cutting the gap between loans and deposits by 130 billion euros
($170 billion), booking 60 billion euros of provisions and
accumulating 20 billion euros of capital in a process that
leaves the bank prepared to embark on a new period of earnings
growth, Saenz said. Santander will report first-quarter earnings
on April 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
