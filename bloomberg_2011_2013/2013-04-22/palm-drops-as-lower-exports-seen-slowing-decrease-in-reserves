Palm oil fell to the lowest level
in four months on speculation that a decline in shipments from
 Malaysia , the second-largest producer, will slow the pace of
decline in the country’s stockpiles.  The contract for July delivery lost as much as 1.4 percent
to 2,263 ringgit ($744) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the lowest price for most-active futures since Dec.
14, before trading at 2,280 ringgit at 12:17 p.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Futures dropped 2.1 percent last week for a fourth
weekly decline, the longest losing streak since the four weeks
ended Dec. 14.  Exports fell 4.9 percent to 882,469 tons in the first 20
days of April from a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said April
20. Reserves dropped to a seven-month low of 2.17 million tons
in March as  shipments  gained for the first time in five months,
according to the Malaysian  Palm Oil  Board. Futures lost 23
percent in 2012 as stockpiles rose to a record.  “The expectation was that if palm oil exports can stay
flat month-on-month, then there’s a chance that inventories can
get below 2 million tons” in April, Alan Lim Seong Chun, an
analyst at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone today. It
now looks like they may stay above the 2 million level, he said.  Soybean oil  for July delivery fell 0.8 percent to 48.79
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade and soybeans dropped
0.7 percent to $13.7275 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery declined as much as
2.1 percent to 5,994  yuan  ($970) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , the lowest level for the most-active contract since
November 2009, while soybean oil fell as much as 1.9 percent to
7,474 yuan a ton, the lowest since July 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
