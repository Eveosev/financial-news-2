Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  and the
U.S. won approval from a federal judge of the plan to resolve
the government’s antitrust lawsuit over the beermaker’s proposed
$20.1 billion purchase of Grupo Modelo SAB.  U.S. District Judge Richard Roberts in Washington yesterday
issued an order governing steps needed for completion of the
deal as submitted to him by the Justice Department and the
brewers in the case, including adding  Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ) 
as a defendant in the suit. The judge has yet to approve the
final settlement.  In a proposed settlement filed April 19, AB InBev made
binding commitments to turn winemaker Constellation Brands into
a competing brewer that will produce and control all Modelo
brands in the U.S., including Corona, the country’s biggest
import. The government said the accord could save beer drinkers
almost $1 billion a year due to lower prices.  The agreement permits AB InBev, the world’s biggest
beermaker, to intensify its push into fast-growing  emerging
markets . It also allows Constellation to buy the stake that
Modelo holds in their joint U.S. distribution venture for $1.85
billion, as announced at the time of AB InBev’s original bid.
The Leuven, Belgium-based company expects the Modelo merger to
deliver cost and revenue benefits of at least $1 billion a year
as it extends its global lead over No. 2  SABMiller Plc. (SAB)   The case is U.S. v. Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, 13-cv-00127,
U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
