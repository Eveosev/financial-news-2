Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding
Co. (7003)  surged to 5 1/2-year high on a Nikkei report it plans to
hold merger talks with  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (7012)  to create
Japan’s second-biggest heavy machinery maker.  Shares of Mitsui Engineering soared as much as 21 percent
to 204 yen, the biggest intraday gain since Oct. 30, 2008, while
Kawasaki Heavy rose 3.6 percent to 345 yen. The two companies
aim to complete a merger in the financial year starting April
2015, the Nikkei newspaper reported without citing anyone.  Japanese manufacturers are under pressure to merge as they
face sluggish local demand and intensifying competition with
South Korean and Chinese rivals. Kawasaki Heavy and Mitsui
Engineering would have combined annual sales of 1.9 trillion yen
($19 billion), behind only  Mitsubishi Heavy (7011)  Industries Ltd.
among Japanese makers of heavy machinery makers, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Kawasaki Heavy said earlier today that there’s no truth to
the Nikkei report in a statement filed to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, while Mitsui Engineering said that it’s not the source
of the article.  Mitsubishi Heavy and  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  said last year they plan
to combine energy-equipment businesses by January 2014,
deepening ties between two Japan’s biggest industrial
manufacturers. Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp., the world’s
second-biggest steelmaker, was formed by a domestic merger in
October to become more competitive with rivals in  China  and
 South Korea .  Kawasaki Heavy, based in the western port city of Kobe, was
founded as a shipbuilder in 1878. The company has become one of
 Japan ’s top three makers of heavy machinery and produces
everything from submarines for Japan’s self defense forces and
high-speed trains to Ninja racing bikes.　  Mitsui Engineering, founded in 1917 as the shipbuilding arm
of Mitsui & Co., is most dependent of ship operations among
heavy industry makers with sales accounting for half of the
total.  To contact the reporters on this story:
