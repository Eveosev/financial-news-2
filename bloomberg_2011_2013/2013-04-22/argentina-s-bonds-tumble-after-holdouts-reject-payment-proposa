Argentina ’s dollar bonds due 2017
dropped the most in four weeks after holdout creditors from the
nation’s 2001 default rejected a proposal that could force them
to take a discount of at least 85 percent on untendered notes.  The so-called global bonds fell 0.89 cent to 78.51 cents on
the dollar, the biggest drop on a closing basis since March 27,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The extra yield
investors demand to own Argentine notes instead of Treasuries
widened eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 1,217
basis points, the highest in  emerging markets , at 11:38 a.m. in
New York, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global index.  On April 19, holders of defaulted debt who say they’re owed
$1.47 billion in principal and interest rejected Argentina’s
March 29 offer, saying it amounted to less than 15 percent of
what they’re seeking. The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in New York will
now decide whether to uphold a lower court order that Argentina
pay the holdouts in full at the same time as paying owners of
restructured bonds.  “The time lapse made us wonder if there were some”
negotiations taking place between the two parties, Casey Reckman, an economist at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a
research note to clients. “It remains possible that the
decision could be announced in time to put the June foreign law
debt payments at risk.”  Argentina is scheduled to make a $42 million interest
payment on June 2 for dollar bonds due 2017, and a $345 million
payment on June 30 for the so-called discount bonds due 2033,
according to Bank of America Corp.  The cost to protect $10 million of Argentine debt against
non-payment for five years with credit-default swaps rose 68
basis points at 11 a.m. in  New York  to 2,139 basis points, data
compiled by CMA Ltd. show. The swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent if
a borrower fails to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
