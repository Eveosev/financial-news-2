Grain exports from  Russia , this
season’s fifth-biggest  wheat shipper , jumped 57 percent this
month from March as domestic prices fell, according to the
 Agriculture Ministry .  Deliveries increased to 322,000 metric tons in April’s
first 17 days from 205,000 tons in the first 20 days of March,
figures published today on the ministry’s website showed.  The government has sold almost 3 million tons of cereals
from stockpiles since October in an effort to reduce prices,
which climbed to records after a drought reduced last year’s
crop to 70.9 million tons. Average milling-wheat prices have
been falling since the second week of February and reached 9,575
rubles ($303) a ton last week, according to figures from
researcher SovEcon.  “Exports increased in April because prices in southern
Russia fell and became competitive for supplies to such
countries as  Tunisia ,” Vladimir Petrichenko, director of
Moscow-based consultancy OOO ProZerno, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
