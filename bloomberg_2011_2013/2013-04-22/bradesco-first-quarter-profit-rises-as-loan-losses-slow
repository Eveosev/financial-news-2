Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) ,  Latin America ’s
second-biggest bank by market value, said profit rose 3.2
percent as the lender curtailed the growth of bad loans.  First-quarter adjusted net income, which excludes one-time
items, climbed to 2.94 billion reais ($1.46 billion) from 2.85
billion reais a year earlier, the Osasco, Brazil-based firm said
today in a filing. That matched the 3 billion-real  average 
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bradesco, led by Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi, 61, said provisions for bad loans rose at a
slower pace than lending, as  Brazil ’s consumer  delinquency  rates
declined in February to the lowest since November 2011. Loans at
least 90 days overdue, a signal of future write-offs, fell to 4
percent at the end of March from 4.1 percent a year earlier, the
company said.  “We liked Bradesco’s results, especially the positive
trend for administrative expenses,” analysts at Banco Itau BBA,
including Regina Longo Sanchez, wrote in a report today, also
citing improved asset quality and the decline in soured loans.  Provisions increased 0.5 percent to 3.11 billion reais in
the first quarter from a year earlier. Loans rose 12 percent to
391.7 billion reais. Administrative and personnel expenses fell
5.6 percent to 6.51 billion reais from the fourth quarter and
rose from 6.28 billion reais a year earlier.  Loan Forecast  The bank expects its portfolio of loans to grow about 15
percent in 2013, the mid-point of its guidance of 13 percent to
17 percent, Luiz Carlos Angelotti,  executive director , told
reporters on a conference call today. Bradesco’s delinquency
rates will continue falling during 2013 as Brazil’s economy
recovers, he said.  Bradesco dropped 0.7 percent to 32.09 reais in  Sao Paulo  at
12:26 p.m., compared with a 0.6 percent  decline  for the
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
