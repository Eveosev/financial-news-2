The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose versus the greenback as gold rallied from the
biggest drop in three decades, fueling appetite for risk.  The South Pacific nations’ currencies rebounded from weekly
losses as monetary stimulus from the U.S. to  Japan  increased
demand for higher-yielding assets. New Zealand’s kiwi dollar was
supported after data showed net  immigration  almost doubled.  “The fact that we seem to have put that gold flash crash
behind us is helping people’s nerves,” supporting demand for
the Aussie and kiwi, said  Sean Callow , a senior currency
strategist in Sydney at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  “The ongoing
money printing by major central banks is also helping.”  The so-called Aussie gained 0.3 percent to $1.0304 as of
12:45 p.m. in Sydney, after earlier dropping to $1.0266, the
lowest since March 11. It fell 2.2 percent last week, the
biggest drop since May. The kiwi rose 0.4 percent to 84.51 U.S.
cents, rebounding from a 2 percent decline last week.  Gold for immediate delivery rose as much as 1.2 percent to
$1,420.90 an ounce and was at $1,416.45. The metal’s five-day
advance is the longest run since December, after a 9.1 percent
plunge on April 15 that was the most since 1983.  Asian stocks  gained  for a second day, with the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index adding 0.5 percent.  New Zealand’s permanent net migration rose 1,220 in March,
according to  Statistics New Zealand  in Wellington. Arrivals
exceeded departures by 2,542 in the year ended March 31, while
net departures to Australia was the lowest since September 2010.  “Migration in New Zealand tends to be influenced by trans-
Tasman movement -- kiwis going to Australia to work, and coming
back,” said  Imre Speizer , Callow’s Auckland-based colleague at
Westpac. “Over the last few months they’ve been coming back,
and that’s a positive for the kiwi dollar, and a negative for
Aussie.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
