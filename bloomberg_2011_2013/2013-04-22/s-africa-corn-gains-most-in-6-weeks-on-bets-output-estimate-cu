South African white-corn futures
rose the most in six weeks on speculation the nation’s Crop
Estimates Committee will reduce its prediction for output of the
grain this week.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract,
gained 2.7 percent, the most since March 11, to 2,177 rand
($234) a metric ton by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in the
same month increased 2.9 percent to 2,152.80 rand a ton.  The committee may cut its corn-production estimate by 2.5
percent from last months forecast to 11.5 million tons,
according to the median of seven analysts’ predictions in a
Bloomberg news survey. The committee will give its third
forecast for summer-grains output on April 25.  “The prices could have been affected by expectations of
exports and the crop estimates that are coming out later in the
week.” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by phone
from  Pretoria .  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as  animal feed . The country has exported 1.68 million tons
of both types since the start of the season in May, 30 percent
less than the same period a season earlier, according to data on
the South African Grain Information Service’s website.  Wheat for May delivery gained 0.7 percent to 3,440 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
