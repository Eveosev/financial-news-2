Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
mortgage originator, is expanding its home-lending headquarters
in Iowa as the firm plans for growth even while the industry
predicts a slowing market.  The bank started construction on a building that will
increase capacity at its West Des Moines office complex by about
28 percent, or 265,000 square feet, the San Francisco-based
company said in an April 19 statement. The project will cost
$100 million, Alfredo Padilla, a bank spokesman, said in an e-
mail. The edifice will house 1,800 workers and a parking garage
also is planned.  The expansion will give the mortgage operations, led by
Michael Heid, “room to relocate current team members to the
facility from leased spaces and allow space for future growth,”
according to the statement.  Wells Fargo, which originated almost 30 percent of all U.S.
mortgages last year, is expanding regional operations and adding
staff amid forecasts for slower home lending and signs its
biggest competitors are pulling back. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said
in February that it will cut 13,000 to 15,000 jobs in its
mortgage unit. The  Mortgage Bankers Association  predicts a 16
percent decline in home lending this year to  $1.48 trillion .  Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf , 59, is expanding
mortgage operations elsewhere. In February, Wells Fargo was set
to open a 111,349-square-foot office in Tempe,  Arizona , with
plans to hire 900 workers. The bank, which added 5,100 employees
in the first quarter, also is increasing staff in  Georgia  and
the Pacific Northwest, cementing its status as the U.S. lender
with the most full-time employees, with 274,300 as of March 31.  Construction in West Des Moines, about 335 miles west of
Chicago, is expected to be finished in two years, according to
the statement. Wells Fargo employs more than 13,500 people in
the Des Moines area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
