De La Rue Plc (DLAR)  plummeted to the
lowest since December 2011 after the world’s biggest banknote
printer reduced its profit target, citing pricing pressure
because of competition.  The  shares  dropped as much as 11 percent. The company
reduced its forecast for operating profit this fiscal year to
about 90 million pounds ($145 million) from 100 million pounds.  “The continuing overcapacity in the banknote paper market
has led to a worsening pricing environment in the printed
banknote market,” the Basingstoke, England-based company said
in a statement today. Recent orders for delivery in the second
half of this fiscal year and the next year reflect this pricing
pressure, it said.  De La Rue is reducing costs to compete with banknote
producers in countries such as  India . The company, which has
been involved in the design and production of more than 150
national currencies in recent years, has said it will reduce
expenses by 40 million pounds in this fiscal year.  The shares were down 9.2 percent at 890.50 pence as of
11:30 a.m., valuing De La Rue at 889 million pounds. The stock
has dropped 2.4 percent this year and was the biggest decliner
today on the  FTSE All-Share Index. (ASX)   “Excess capacity in banknote paper markets means paper
prices are under pressure and that leads us to think that
medium-term the road to recovery for De La Rue could be quite
tricky,”  Paul Jones , an analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co., said
in an interview.  Panmure Gordon reduced its recommendation for De La Rue to
sell from hold and cut the stock’s target price to 786 pence
from 964 pence.  Investec Plc (INVP)  downgraded De La Rue to hold from
add and reduced the target price to 885 pence from 1,070 pence.  De La Rue’s first-half operating profit rose 18 percent
from a year earlier to about 39 million pounds, in line with
expectations, according to today’s statement. Banknote print
volumes fell 10 percent to 2.6 billion notes, while paper
volumes increased 4 percent to 4,700 metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
