The Canadian dollar touched its
lowest level in a week on speculation global growth may slow if
 China ’s central bank raises interest rates.  The currency fell against the majority of its most-traded
peers before the Bank of Canada releases a monetary policy
report projected to cut growth forecasts. Senior Deputy Governor
Tiff Macklem said earlier this month that the nation’s economy
will expand more slowly than had been estimated.  Borrowing costs 
for Chinese banks jumped by the most since July after an
academic adviser to the central bank said earlier in the week it
may lean to tighter policy if inflation accelerates.  “We’ve seen the dollar rise generally from Asian hours,
which to be honest I think is related to fear China could be
hiking interest rates again and that’s coming through into
demand for safe haven, into the dollar, into the yen, and
hitting commodity currencies,” said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International, by phone from  London .
“Canadian dollar perhaps softer going into the meeting on this
Chinese news.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 0.4 percent to
C$1.0329 per U.S. dollar at 8:05 a.m. in Toronto. It touched
C$1.0338 per U.S. dollar, the weakest since Oct. 16. One loonie
buys 96.82 U.S. cents.  The Bank of Canada is  forecast  to keep its benchmark
interest rate at 1 percent at tis 10 a.m. rate decision,
according to all 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
