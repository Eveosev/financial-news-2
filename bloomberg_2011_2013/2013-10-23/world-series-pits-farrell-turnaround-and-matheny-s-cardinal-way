Red Sox manager John Farrell was given the task of changing a culture in  Boston , which a year ago had its worst season in 47 years.  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny was handed the reins of a championship team in  St. Louis , which two years ago captured its 11th World Series title in  Tony La Russa ’s final season.  Starting from different ends of the spectrum, they’ve reached  Major League Baseball ’s World Series, which begins tonight in Boston with Game 1 in the best-of-seven matchup.  Jon Lester  will be the starting pitcher for Boston, while the Cardinals counter with Adam Wainwright.  “Two historic  franchises  with a lot of history and a lot of success,” said the 43-year-old Matheny, who had no previous managerial experience when he replaced La Russa last season. “We take a lot of pride in what has been able to kind of define the Cardinal way and how we go about our business.”  The Cardinals came within a win of a return trip to the  World Series  in Matheny’s debut season a year ago, losing to the  San Francisco Giants  in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series. This year, they tied the Red Sox for the best record in the majors at 97-65 and captured the NL pennant with a six-game NLCS win against the  Los Angeles Dodgers .  “As far as walking into a team that had just won the World Series, I don’t know if you could ask for a better situation,” Matheny said. “You have a group of guys who are talented, but experienced as well. I didn’t come in expecting to ever replace a Hall of Fame-caliber manager like Tony La Russa. I came in to do what I could do and let these guys know that we’re going to do a lot of learning along the way.”  Boston Turnaround  In Boston, Farrell turned around a Red Sox team that went 69-93 a year ago under  Bobby Valentine , the franchise’s first losing season since 1997. It was the club’s worst record since going 62-100 in 1965.  Red Sox president Larry Lucchino called it a “season of agony” that begged for changes.  Enter Farrell, Boston’s former pitching coach who spent the previous two seasons as manager of the  Toronto Blue Jays .  A divided and injury-plagued team that finished in last place in the  American League East  in 2012 this year won the division by 5 1/2 games and had the best home record in the AL. The Red Sox reached the World Series by defeating the  Detroit Tigers  in six games in the AL Championship Series.  Core Group  “It was clear that this was a group of veteran guys that have come from winning environments, and we were getting a core group back that was healthy,” Farrell, 51, said yesterday. “Guys that had won championships. Guys that had been All-Star caliber players. And as the season unfolded, the tight-knit group that we know today started to experience some things, and answer some challenges that we felt like we had a good team.”  While there is a slight chance of rain early in tonight’s game, “it won’t be a rainout,” said Dan DePodwin, a meteorologist at AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  “It is looking like a bit of a chilly night,” DePodwin said in a telephone interview. “You will probably want to have the jacket and maybe the gloves as well by the end of the game.”  At first pitch, the temperature will probably be in the mid-40s Fahrenheit falling to the low 40s by the end of the game, he said. The low in Boston tonight is expected to reach 39, according to the  National Weather Service .  Historic Teams  The  Red Sox  and Cardinals are two of baseball’s most storied franchises, with more than 17,700 wins between them since the early 1900s, and have combined to capture four of the past nine World Series titles.  The Cardinals won championships in 2006 and 2011, while the Red Sox claimed titles in 2004 and 2007. Matheny was the starting catcher for the Cardinals team that was swept by Boston in the 2004 World Series.  “You give credit where it’s due, and this team in Boston has done some amazing things to make this happen this year,” Matheny said. “Some of us have pretty bad memories of being here in 2004, and we’re looking to kind of right that ship.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Erik Matuszewski in  New York  at  matuszewski@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Sillup at  msillup@bloomberg.net
