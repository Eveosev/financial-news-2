Melbourne Victory said Ange
Postecoglou will be released by the A-League club to become head
coach of  Australia ’s national soccer team.  Victory Chairman Anthony Di Pietro said in a statement that
the club’s board of directors “will be supporting Postecoglou’s
transition into the Socceroos coaching job.”  The Victory had been negotiating with Football Federation
Australia, which fired Holger Osieck as Socceroos coach on Oct.
12, about releasing Postecoglou from his contract that expires
at the end of the 2014-2015 season.  “The circumstances that Ange and the club have been
confronted with are complex and compelling, no matter what
perspective you take,” Di Pietro said in the  statement . “That
said, we have made it clear to Ange that we will not stand in
the way of him accepting the biggest coaching role in this
country.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
