China’s stocks  rose, led by
financial and industrial shares, after Ping An Bank Co. posted a
jump in net income and Sichuan province-based companies rallied
on a newspaper report on investment projects.  Ping An Bank advanced 4.7 percent after saying profit
increased 20 percent in the third quarter. Sichuan Road & Bridge
Co. and Sichuan Expressway Co. jumped 10 percent after the
Sichuan Daily said the province plans to roll out investment
projects worth 4.3 trillion  yuan  ($705.7 million). China Railway
Erju Co. led a rally for rail companies after the value of its
projects in the first nine months surged 73 percent.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.6 percent to 2,224.57
as of 9:50 a.m. local time. The CSI 300 Index gained 0.8 percent
to 2,464.19. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  advanced 0.7
percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index fell 0.1 percent
yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite trades at 8.7 times projected
earnings for the next 12 months, compared with the seven-year
average of 15.4, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The
index has rebounded 13 percent from its four-year low on June 27
on speculation the government will take reform measures to
sustain long-term economic growth.  China may signal plans to ease the nation’s one-child
policy, encourage companies to increase dividend payouts and
start pilot programs to reform rural land rights and allow more
free-trade zones during next month’s meeting of the Communist
Party, according to Bank of America Corp.  There won’t be material reforms of state-owned enterprises
nor a major breakthrough in reform of Hukou residency permits,
