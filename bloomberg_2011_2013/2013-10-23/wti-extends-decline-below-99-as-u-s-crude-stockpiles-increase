West Texas Intermediate fell to the
lowest in more than three months as crude stockpiles rose in the
U.S., the world’s biggest oil consumer. The grade’s discount to
North Sea Brent was its biggest in six months.  Futures dropped as much as 2 percent in New York. Crude
inventories increased by 3 million barrels last week, the
American Petroleum Institute said yesterday. A government report
today is projected to show supplies climbed by the same amount,
advancing for a fifth week, according to a Bloomberg News
 survey . Oil stockpiles in  China , the second-largest consumer,
gained last month to the highest level in official data today
going back to January 2010.  “The weakness of WTI versus Brent is partly down to an
abundance of crude in the U.S. at a time when refinery runs are
low,” said  Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies
Bache Ltd. in London.  WTI for December delivery slid as much as $1.98 to $96.32 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest since July 1. It was at $96.73 as of 1:43
p.m. London time. The November contract expired yesterday down
$1.42 at $97.80. The volume of all futures traded was about 52
percent more than the 100-day average.  Brent for December settlement was down 16 cents at $109.81
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark was at a premium of as much as $13.37 to WTI,
the widest since April 2.  Fuel Supplies  U.S. gasoline stockpiles shrank by 510,000 barrels in the
week ended Oct. 18, the industry-funded API said. A report today
from the Energy Information Administration may show inventories
decreased by 1 million, according to the median estimate of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The EIA is the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  Distillate supplies, including heating oil and diesel, rose
by 815,000 barrels, the API data show. A median 1.8 million drop
is  forecast  in the Energy Department survey.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA, which is
scheduled to release its data at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  “The move in WTI is a reaction to supply levels in the
U.S.,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets
in Sydney who predicts investors may buy WTI at about $95 a
barrel. “Fundamentals are driving the current momentum.”  In China, crude stockpiles increased by 1.43 percent in
September from August, according to China Oil, Gas &
Petrochemicals, a newsletter published by the official Xinhua
News Agency. The data excludes emergency reserves. Supplies
climbed to 32.41 million metric tons, or about 237.6 million
barrels, Bloomberg calculations show.  The Asian nation accounted for about 11 percent of global
oil consumption this year, compared with 21 percent for the
U.S., according to the International Energy Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
