Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) , the second-largest U.S. eastern railroad, rose the most in almost two years
after posting third-quarter profit that beat analystsâ€™ estimates
amid rising shipments of steel, fracking sand and farm products.  Net income  jumped 20 percent to $482 million, or $1.53 a
share, from $402 million, or $1.24 a year earlier, the Norfolk,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. That topped
the  average estimate  of $1.39 from 26 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The increase in so-called merchandise shipping helped
Norfolk Southern weather a drop in coal volumes, which have been
under pressure as utilities switch to cheaper natural gas. Sand
is used by oil and gas explorers for hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, to tap deposits that were previously out of reach.  Norfolk Southern climbed 6.5 percent to $85.87 at 3:26 p.m.
in  New York , the biggest intraday jump since Oct. 27, 2011.
Earlier the stock touched $86.58, the highest price in Bloomberg
data going back to at least 1980. The shares had gained 30
percent this year through yesterday.  Sales climbed 4.9 percent to $2.8 billion, and shipment
volumes increased 4 percent, Norfolk Southern said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
