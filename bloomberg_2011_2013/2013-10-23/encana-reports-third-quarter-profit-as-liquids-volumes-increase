Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s largest
natural-gas producer, returned to a third-quarter profit after
raising output of oil and petroleum liquids amid higher prices.  Net income was $188 million, or 25 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $1.24 billion, or $1.69, a year earlier, the
company said today in a statement on Marketwired. Excluding one-time items, per-share profit was 20 cents, exceeding the 16-cent
average  estimate  of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Encana is focusing 80 percent of its spending this year on
almost doubling oil and liquids production following a slump in
North American gas prices since 2008. Results a year ago
included a $1.19 billion reduction because of the price decline.  Oil and natural-gas liquids output averaged about 58,200
barrels a day in the third quarter, a 92 percent increase from a
year earlier, the Calgary-based company said in the statement.  Gas production averaged about 2.7 billion cubic feet a day.
Encana revised its forecast for 2013 output to 2.7 billion to
2.8 billion cubic feet a day, reflecting asset sales and delays
to the ramp-up of the Deep Panuke project off  Nova Scotia .  Doug Suttles , who became chief executive officer in June,
said at an investor conference last month the company needs to
“clean up its portfolio” and will review its dividend as part
of a strategic review. The company has maintained a 20-cent
quarterly payout since 2009.  North American gas prices, which sank to a 10-year low in
April 2012, rose during the quarter to average $3.555 per
million British thermal units in  New York , 23 percent more than
a year earlier.  Oil prices  in the U.S. climbed 15 percent from a
year earlier to average $105.81 a barrel.  Encana released results before the start of regular trading
on North American markets. The company advanced 2.3 percent to
C$18.79 in Toronto yesterday. The shares, which have dropped 4.4
percent this year, have six buy, 15 hold and five sell
 recommendations  from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
