Queens Park Rangers signed U.S.
defender Oguchi Onyewu as the club aims to return to English
soccer’s Premier League after its relegation last season.  Onyewu, 31, joins on a free transfer after leaving Sporting
Lisbon at the end of the last campaign. He’s made 68 appearances
for the U.S. national team and had spells at clubs including
Standard Liege and AC Milan.  “QPR are a club with huge ambitions to return to the
Premier League and I wanted to be part of it,” Onyewu told
 QPR’s website . “I had a really good feeling about QPR from the
moment I arrived here. I’ve been welcomed by the club and I feel
good here already.”  QPR is second in the Championship, two points behind
Burnley. The teams meet at Turf Moor in three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
