Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which expects half
of Japan sales this year to be minicars, will unveil its first
mini sportscar since 1996 amid booming demand for more fuel-efficient, cheaper vehicles in Japan.  The S660 concept mini sportscar will be introduced at the
Tokyo Motor Show next month and begin selling next year, Honda
said in a statement. The two-seater will be a convertible, Ryo
Sugiura, its exterior designer, told reporters.  The S660 will be one of the six minicars Honda plans to
introduce by 2015 to challenge  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  subsidiary
 Daihatsu Motor Co. (7262)  and  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) , the leaders in a
category that accounts for about 40 percent of new-car sales in
 Japan . Minicar sales are projected to rise this year in Japan
even as total industry demand shrinks after the end of
government incentives, according to researcher IHS Automotive.  “The best point about minicars is their low cost,”
Sugiura said, declining to disclose the planned S660 price.
“This car will mainly be for sportscar hobbyists.”  Called “Kei” cars in Japan, minicars are those with
engines smaller than 0.66 liters and are taxed at a lower rate.  Tokyo-based Honda had sold an open-top mini sportscar,
named Beat, from 1991 to 1996 in Japan. The car was priced at
1.39 million ($14,000) and total deliveries reached 33,682
units.  NSX Hybrid  Daihatsu also sold a mini sportscar, the Copen, from 2002
to 2012, with accumulated deliveries of about 60,000 units. The
production of the model ended June last year, as the carmaker
plans to introduce a new model next year.  Honda, which introduced its N-Box minicar line in 2011,
almost doubled its market share in the category to 18.4 percent
in 2012 from a year earlier.  Its goal to make half its sales minicars would propel Honda
past Daihatsu, which saw its market share fall to 33 percent in
2012 from 36 percent a year earlier. Suzuki accounted for less
than 30 percent of minicar sales in the year ended March for the
first time since at least 2007.  Honda will also premier an NSX sportscar with a hybrid
engine and a new N-series mini wagon at the Tokyo Motor Show
scheduled to run from Nov. 20 to Dec. 1 in the Japanese capital.
The show opens to the public on Nov. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
