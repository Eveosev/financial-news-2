An international group of
counterfeiters sold at least 400 bottles of fake Romanee-Conti
wine, one of the world’s most expensive, for at least 2 million
euros ($2.7 million), French prosecutors said.  Seven people were arrested after raids on 20 residences and
depots in various European Union countries, and more suspects
are being pursued, the Dijon prosecutor’s office said in a
statement. French police seized 69 bottles in  France , and tests
showed a blend of poor quality wine in fake bottles, the
prosecutor’s office said.  “The contents of the examined bottles were a mediocre wine
with very poor flavor and quality composed of blends of
undetermined origins,” it said.  The apparent ringleaders, an Italian father-and-son team of
wine merchants, were arrested by Italian police, and French
authorities are seeking their extradition. The offense carries a
maximum prison time of 10 years, according to the statement.  Romanee-Conti, based in Vosne Romanee in Burgundy, produces
about 6,000 bottles a year of its pinot noir red wine, according
to the statement. Prices of its 2008 and 2009 vintages can reach
9,000 euros a bottle, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
