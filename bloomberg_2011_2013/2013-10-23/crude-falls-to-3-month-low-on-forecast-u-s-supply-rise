West Texas Intermediate crude fell
to the lowest level in almost four months as supplies rose more
than expected in the U.S., the biggest oil-consuming country.  Prices dropped 1.5 percent. Crude  inventories  climbed 5.25
million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration
said. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated a gain of 3
million. Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , increased for a second
week and domestic production jumped to the most in 24 years.  “The report adds up to a pretty bearish signal to the
market,” said Julius Walker, global energy markets strategist
at UBS Securities LLC in New York who forecast WTI will average
$95 this quarter. “The striking thing is another Cushing build
in addition to the total U.S. build. Fundamentals are gradually
easing.”  WTI for December delivery slid $1.44 to $96.86 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since
June 28. The volume of all futures traded was 22 percent more
than the 100-day average for the time of day at 3:28 p.m. Prices
have tumbled 5.3 percent since Oct. 16.  Brent for December settlement declined $2.17, or 2 percent,
to $107.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The volume of all futures traded was 41 percent above
the 100-day average. WTI’s discount to Brent narrowed to $10.94
from $11.67 yesterday. It widened to $13.37 earlier, the most in
six months on an intraday basis.  Supplies Increase  U.S. crude supplies rose to 379.8 million barrels last
week, the most since June 28, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. They have climbed 24.2 million
barrels, or 6.8 percent, in the last five weeks.  “Fundamentally, it’s a weak market for WTI,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital
Advisors. “Everything points to lower prices.”  Stockpiles at Cushing, the delivery point for WTI futures,
increased 358,000 barrels to 33.3 million. Supplies at the hub
dropped in the 14 weeks ended Oct. 4, the longest streak since
EIA began publishing data from Cushing in 2004, as improved
pipeline networks and rail moved more oil to Gulf Coast
refineries.  “The bottleneck there is not fully resolved, and crude is
backing up in the Cushing area again,” Walker said.  Production Climbs  U.S. crude  production  grew 6.3 percent last week to 7.9
million barrels a day, the most since March 1989. A combination
of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,
has unlocked supplies in shale formations in North Dakota,  Texas 
and other states.  “People are starting to realize that it’s hard to be
bullish, given the rising inventory levels,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in
Winchester,  Massachusetts .  Gasoline stockpiles fell 0.8 percent to 215.5 million
barrels and  distillate  fuels, including heating oil and diesel,
climbed 1.2 percent to 125.8 million.  Refineries operated at 85.9 percent of capacity, the lowest
level in almost six months. Total  petroleum demand  dropped 3.8
percent to 18.3 million barrels a day. The  four-week average  was
18.7 million, a 17-week low.  Crude stockpiles in China, the second-largest consuming
country after the U.S., rose to a record in September, based on
data going back to January 2010.  China Supplies  Commercially held supplies increased 1.4 percent from
August, according to a report today from  China  Oil, Gas &
Petrochemicals, a newsletter published by the official Xinhua
News Agency. That’s 32.4 million metric tons, or 237.6 million
barrels, Bloomberg calculations based on the data show.  The Asian nation accounted for 11 percent of global oil
consumption this year, compared with 21 percent for the U.S.,
according to the International Energy Agency.  “The market is really pricing in the well-supplied
fundamentals in the U.S. and China,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief
market strategist and founder of Iitrader.com in  Chicago .  Iraq , the second-largest oil producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, reiterated plans to boost
crude output and exports by the end of the year as demand from
Asian buyers strengthens.  Production will rise to 3.5 million barrels a day by the
end of December and increase further in 2014, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi told reporters in  Baghdad  today. Iraq’s output
is about 3.3 million barrels a day, Deputy Prime Minister
Hussain Al-Shahristani said a week ago.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
December was 22.1 percent, up from 20.5 percent yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 673,878
contracts as of 3:28 p.m. It totaled 774,795 contracts
yesterday, 33 percent higher than the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.79 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
