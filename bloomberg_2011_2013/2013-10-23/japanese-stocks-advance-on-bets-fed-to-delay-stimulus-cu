Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
index slumping the most in three weeks, after the yen jumped and
 China ’s money-market rates surged.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 83 percent of
 revenue  overseas, slid 2.8 percent. Nitto Denko Corp. fell the
most on the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
cut its rating on the chemical-products maker. Japan Exchange
Group Inc., operator of the country’s main bourse, dropped 3.7
percent after its profit forecast missed estimates. Fanuc Corp.,
which supplies robotics for Chinese factories, lost 2.3 percent.  The Topix fell 1.5 percent to 1,195.98 at the close in
Tokyo, the biggest drop since Oct. 2. All 33 industry groups
fell after rising on speculation the  Federal Reserve  would delay
tapering stimulus. The Nikkei 225 lost 2 percent to 14,426.05.
The yen gained against all of its 16 major counterparts, rising
0.8 percent to trade at 97.37 per dollar.  “The yen’s gain is hitting stocks,” said Ichiro Yamada,
general manager of equities at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance.
“Volume is too thin to send equities beyond last month’s high.
I think investors are taking profit.”  Exporters fell as the yen gained and China’s benchmark
money-market rate jumped the most since July as the central bank
refrained from adding funds to markets and corporate tax
payments drained cash.  Honda slid 2.8 percent to 3,850 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a
construction-machinery maker that gets about 80 percent of
revenue abroad, dropped 1.2 percent to 2,371 yen, revering a
gain of as much as 1.9 percent. Fanuc lost 2.3 percent to 16,250
yen.  Stimulus Bets  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.4
percent today. The equity gauge climbed 0.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday after U.S. payrolls grew less than forecast, adding to
speculation record stimulus will be maintained. U.S. employers
added 148,000 workers to payrolls in September, indicating the
world’s largest economy had little momentum heading into the 16-day government shutdown. The Fed has said it needed more
evidence of recovery before cutting bond purchases.  The  Topix (TPX)  added 0.2 percent this month, last among its 24
developed-market peers, after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decided
to push ahead with a sales-tax increase and the U.S. shut down
parts of its government. The equity gauge remains the best
performer among the markets this year.  About 570 companies on the 1,744-member Topix are scheduled
to report  results  from today through Oct. 31, with earnings
 season  peaking next week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Earnings Outlook  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. named 10 stocks including Nintendo
Co. and Sony Corp. that have “significant potential” to miss
quarterly earnings estimates. Dainippon Screen Manufacturing
Co., Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. are among five stocks that may
post positive surprises, analysts led by Shin Horie wrote in the
report.  Nitto Denko (6988)  slumped 7.5 percent to 5,300 yen after JPMorgan
cut its rating to neutral from overweight and reduced the price
target to 6,000 yen.  Japan Exchange dropped 3.7 percent to 2,219 yen after
saying it expects to earn 22 billion yen ($226 million) in the
year ending March 31, falling short of the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that gained, GCA Savvian Corp. rose 2.6
percent to 1,095 yen. The company will expand its merger and
acquisition advisory business in  India  by partnering with ICICI
Securities Ltd., according to a Nikkei newspaper report. Nidec
Corp., a maker of small precision motors, climbed 4.5 percent to
9,150 yen after raising its profit forecast 2.8 percent to 55
billion yen.  The Topix  traded  at 1.25 times book value today, compared
with 2.57 for the S&P 500 and 1.80 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday. The Japanese gauge’s 30-day  historic volatility 
was at 15.38 today, compared with its five-year median of 19.27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
