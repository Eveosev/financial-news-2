Lacrosse added more teams than any
other college sport last year, with 40 women’s squads and 26
men’s joining the list, according to the  National Collegiate
Athletic Association .  Other rapidly growing sports included women’s golf, which
added 30 teams, and men’s indoor track, with 23 new programs.  Both men’s and women’s tennis team numbers declined, with
nine women’s and eight men’s programs dropped, according to the
NCAA’s annual  participation rates report .  The total number of athletes participating in NCAA-sponsored championship sports increased by 2.2 percent to
463,202 in 2012-2013, while the number of men’s (18,561) and
women’s (18,835) teams were an all-time high.  The gap between the number of men and women participating
in sports has decreased since the college sports governing body
began collecting data in 1981-82.  That year, men accounted for 72 percent of the total
athlete population, compared with 57 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
