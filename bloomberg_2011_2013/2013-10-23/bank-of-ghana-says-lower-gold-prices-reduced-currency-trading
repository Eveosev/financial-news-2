Currency trading  in Ghana has slowed
as foreign-exchange inflows from gold exports declined and the
central bank refrained from using reserves to bolster the cedi,
First Deputy Governor Millison Narh said.  Prices for the precious metal dropped 20 percent this year,
bringing less money into Ghana’s foreign reserves that it sells
at sporadic intervals to banks, Narh said in an interview in the
capital, Accra, today. The West African nation is the
continent’s biggest producer of gold after South Africa.  “We get less foreign currency from exports, especially
from gold,” Narh said.“We don’t want to sell everything to the
market, investors also look at our reserves.”  The cedi weakened as much as 0.8 percent and traded 0.5
percent lower at 2.200 per dollar by 3:23 p.m. in the capital,
 Accra , extending its slide this year to 13 percent, the worst on
the continent among 24 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
Johannesburg-based  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  and
Greenwood Village, Colorado-based Newmont Mining Corp. have gold
mines in the country.  The comments from Narh suggests “the central bank will
have less dollars to support the cedi going forward,” Collins Appiah, head of asset management at NDK Asset Management Ltd. in
Accra, said by phone. “I believe importers started rushing to
buy and keep the few dollars that are on the market right now.”  Ghana’s reserves rose to $5.8 billion in August from $5
billion at the end of 2012, the  Bank of Ghana  said on Sept. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
