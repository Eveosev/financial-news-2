Hog futures declined the most in two
weeks on signs of increasing U.S. pork output as cheap feed
leads to bigger animals at slaughter. Cattle were little
changed.  Meat processors slaughtered 865,000 animals this week, up
0.2 from a year earlier, and animals  weighed  2.2 percent more on
average, U.S. Department of agriculture data show. The price of
corn, the main ingredient in feed, plunged 41 percent in the
past year as the government forecast a record U.S. crop.  “We are going to see a lot of hogs in November and
December,” and low feed costs will encourage producers to
expand their herds, Dennis Smith, a senior account executive at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  Hog futures for December settlement declined 0.6 percent to
88.05 cents a pound at 11:13 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the biggest drop since Oct. 9. Prices
through yesterday were up 13 percent from a year earlier.  Cattle futures for December delivery were unchanged at
$1.32975 a pound on the CME, after fluctuating between gains and
losses. Wholesale-beef prices are up 7 percent since the end of
July and yesterday reached the highest in four months.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement fell 0.1
percent to $1.67775 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
