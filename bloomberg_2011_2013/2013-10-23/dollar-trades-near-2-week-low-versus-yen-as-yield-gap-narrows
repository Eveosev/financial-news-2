The dollar slid to a two-year low
versus the euro as weaker-than-forecast economic data and
concern that U.S. growth was hurt by a government shutdown added
to bets the  Federal Reserve  will delay slowing stimulus until
next year.  The greenback headed for its second weekly losses against
the European currency and the yen as more Americans than
forecast filed jobless-benefit claims and a private index of
manufacturing fell from last month. DBRS Inc. said the U.S.’s
AAA rating remained under review “with negative implications.”
The Czech koruna rallied as confidence in the nation rose.  The “market is turning quite positive euro,” said
Masafumi Takada, a director at BNP Paribas SA in New York. The
17-nation currency is gaining on “the back of U.S. downgrade
fear, a weaker U.S. number, Fed tapering postponed.”  The dollar lost 0.2 percent to $1.3801 per euro at 5 p.m.
 New York  time and reached $1.3825, the weakest since November
2011. It fell 0.1 percent to 97.28 yen after touching 97.16
yesterday, the lowest since Oct. 9.  Europe ’s shared currency
gained 0.1 percent to 134.26 yen after rising as much as 0.5
percent earlier and weakening 0.2 percent.  A gauge of price swings among Group of Seven nations’
currencies touched a 10-month low. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G-7 FX
Volatility Index reached 7.5 percent, the lowest intraday level
since Dec. 21. The gauge was at 10.2 percent on Sept. 3.  Koruna Gains  The Czech koruna rose against all of its 31 most-traded
peers as a national gauge of confidence increased to the highest
since October 2011. The currency rallied 0.7 percent versus the
dollar to 18.6295 and reached 18.6075, the strongest since Feb.
7. The koruna gained 0.5 percent to 25.709 per euro.  Brazil ’s real fell versus most major counterparts on
speculation the nation’s central bank will limit rollovers of
foreign-exchange swaps that have supported a two-month rally.
The currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 2.2033 per dollar.  The euro briefly reversed gains after an index based on a
survey of purchasing managers in the euro-area manufacturing and
services industry  dropped  to 51.5 from 52.2 in September,
London-based Markit Economics said. A Bloomberg survey forecast
52.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “This data is a wake-up call, showing that there are
events that can still knock the euro,” said Jane Foley, a
senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in London.  Europe’s shared currency may have gained too much, too fast
against the greenback, a technical indicator signaled for a
third straight day. The euro’s 14-day relative strength index
reached 74, above the 70 level some traders see as a sign a drop
may be imminent. The gauge rose above the 70 level on Oct. 22.  Shutdown Impact  The partial U.S. government shutdown that began Oct. 1 amid
a political deadlock in  Washington  over spending and the debt
ceiling probably trimmed 0.25 percentage point from fourth-quarter economic growth and cost 120,000 jobs in October,
President  Barack Obama ’s chief economic adviser said on Oct. 22.  DBRS said in an e-mailed statement it’s continuing to study
the U.S.’s top rating, even after a deal ended the shutdown last
week and pushed fiscal deadlines into 2014. The Toronto-based
ratings company put the ranking on review Oct. 9.  Initial  jobless claims  in the U.S. decreased by 12,000 to
350,000 in the week ended Oct. 19 from a revised 362,000 in the
prior period, a Labor Department report showed today. A
Bloomberg forecast a decline to 340,000. Applications in
 California  remained elevated and analysts weren’t able to
determine how many non-federal workers filed due to the
government shutdown, a Labor Department spokesman said.  The Markit Economics preliminary index of U.S.
manufacturing fell to 51.1 in October from 52.8 at the end of
the previous month, the group said. A Bloomberg survey forecast
a decline to 52.5.  March Forecast  The Fed will delay tapering its $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases until March, according to the median estimate of 40
economists surveyed by Bloomberg on Oct. 17-18. The central bank
buys Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to put downward
pressure on long-term yields and spur growth, a move that tends
to debase the greenback.  “While the Fed’s on hold and still pumping liquidity in,
the dollar’s going to be soft against everything,” said Jeremy Hale, head of macro strategy at Citigroup Inc. in  London .
“There’s a feeling that the debacle in Congress damaged the
economy a little bit.”  The dollar slid 1.3 percent in the past month, making it
the second-worst performer, after the Canadian dollar at 2.4
percent, among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro strengthened 1
percent, while the yen was little changed.  Krone Climbs  Norway’s krone climbed to the highest in a month versus the
dollar after the nation’s central bank said the currency
weakened since policy makers last met. After gaining versus the
euro in 2011 and 2012, the krone lost 11 percent this year
following warnings the bank was ready to act to stem gains.  The krone appreciated 0.3 percent to 8.1325 per euro and
advanced 0.5 percent to 5.8923 per dollar. It reached 5.8797 to
the greenback, the strongest since Sept. 20.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $48 billion, versus $51 billion yesterday, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and monitored by Bloomberg. Volume in options on the euro-dollar  exchange rate  amounted to $11.7 billion, the largest
share of trades at 24 percent. Options on the dollar-yen rate
totaled $9.3 billion, or 19 percent.  Euro-dollar options trading was 70 percent more than the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Dollar-yen options trading
was 21 percent above average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
