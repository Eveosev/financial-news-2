The pound fell to the lowest level
in seven weeks against the euro as the  Bank of England  said
policy makers were unanimous in rejecting higher interest rates,
damping demand for Britain’s currency.  Sterling weakened versus 10 of its 16 major peers. The
nine-member Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0 to keep their
quantitative-easing  target  at 375 billion pounds ($606 billion),
according to the minutes of the Oct. 8-9 meeting published in
 London  today. All members also agreed to hold the benchmark
interest rate at a  record-low  0.5 percent. Governor Mark Carney
is due to speak in London tomorrow. Gilts advanced, with 10-year
yields falling to an eight-week low.  “The Bank of England wants to head off the market bringing
forward the expected start date of tightening,” said  Paul Robson , a foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in London. “There isn’t a huge amount of sterling
news. People may be worried about what  Mark Carney  might say
tomorrow.”  The pound depreciated 0.4 percent to 85.23 pence per euro
at 4:38 p.m. London time after reaching 85.32 pence, the weakest
since Sept. 2. Sterling dropped 0.4 percent to $1.6166 after
climbing to $1.6257, the highest since Oct. 1.  Carney introduced forward guidance on the future path of
interest rates in August, saying policy makers won’t consider
raising borrowing costs until unemployment declines to 7
percent, something officials don’t anticipate until 2016.  BOE Minutes  “Market rates had fallen back over the month and output
appeared to be expanding at least as fast as expected” in
August, the Bank of England said in the minutes. “All members
therefore agreed that there was currently little case for
increasing the degree of monetary stimulus further.”  The central bank’s official  interest rate  will remain at a
record low “for several more years,” according to Capital
Economics Ltd.  “A continued period of inaction by the MPC looks in
prospect,” London-based U.K. economist Martin Beck wrote in an
e-mailed report. The  bank rate  “could remain on hold for at
least three more years,” he said.  The pound has strengthened 4.5 percent in the past six
months, the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose
4.4 percent, while the dollar fell 2.1 percent.  The 10-year  gilt  yield dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.60 percent after reaching 2.59 percent,
the lowest since Aug. 27. The 2.25 percent bond maturing in
September 2023 rose 0.365, or 3.65 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 97.01.  Gilts lost 2.4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries fell 1.8
percent and German securities slid 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
