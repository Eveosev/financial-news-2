Ethanol fell for a second day after
the government said production reached a 16-month high and the
corn harvest advanced.  Futures slipped after the U.S. Energy Information
Administration said  output  rose 3.2 percent to 897,000 barrels a
day last week, the most since June 15, 2012. An Oct. 21
Agriculture Department report estimated that farmers have
 harvested  39 percent of their corn, the primary ingredient used
to make ethanol in the U.S. The USDA predicts a record harvest
for corn.  “This should relieve some supply anxiety,” said Jerrod
Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago . “The corn harvest is
in full bore.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery sank 1.6 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $1.801 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures are down 18 percent this year.  Gasoline for November delivery sank 6.44 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $2.5523 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel narrowed 4.84 cents to
75.13 cents a gallon.  Corn for December delivery advanced 4.5 cents, or 1
percent, to $4.4275 a bushel in Chicago. Kitt said the higher
corn price kept ethanol from falling as much as gasoline.  “It’s one of those tail-wagging-the-dog scenarios,” Kitt
said. The December corn crush spread of corn to ethanol was 5
cents, down from 9 cents yesterday.  Below Average  Even with the gain in production, ethanol stockpiles were
 below average for this time of year . Inventories expanded 0.5
percent to 15.5 million barrels, data from the Energy
Department’s statistical arm showed. The U.S. hasn’t made
 foreign purchases  for the past three weeks.  In cash market trading, ethanol decreased 3 cents to $2.22
a gallon on the West Coast, 2.5 cents to $2.115 on the  Gulf
Coast , 2.5 cents to $2.045 in Chicago and 3 cents to $2.15 in
 New York , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The EPA tracks compliance with the federal ethanol-use
mandate with Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, tradable
certificates that are attached to each gallon of biofuel.  Corn-based RINs fell 3 cents to 25 cents, while  advanced
RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, decreased 3 cents to 38 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
