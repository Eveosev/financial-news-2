E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC)  agreed to
sell a market-making unit that had been the subject of a
regulatory inquiry to Susquehanna International Group LLP for
$75 million.  E*Trade is selling G1 Execution Services LLC along with a
promise to send 70 percent of customer equity orders to the
business for five years, according to a statement today.  The deal was announced two months after E*Trade said the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority was looking into how G1
Execution and another division, E*Trade Securities LLC, routed
customer orders. When New York-based E*Trade announced better-than-estimated earnings and plans to find a buyer for G1
Execution in July, its stock surged 7.9 percent, the biggest
rally since August 2011.  The transaction will let E*Trade “concentrate our time and
attention on the core business and our customers,” Chief
Executive Officer Paul Idzik said in the statement.  Profits at market-making business such as G1 Execution are
under pressure in the U.S. as computerized trading squeezes
margins and volume stagnates. G1 Execution has proved to be a
distraction this year, with E*Trade disclosing that it found
“shortcomings” in how it measured whether trades were
completed at the best prices.  In the same statement announcing the sale, E*Trade reported
third-quarter net income of $47 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
