In  a column  yesterday, I argued that the Republicans' reckless irresponsibility over the debt ceiling should have hurt them more than it seems to have done, and this reflects badly on the Democrats. Jonathan Chait thinks the article is a strong  "Worst-Column-Ever" candidate.  Only a really intelligent commentator would think of bestowing such an accolade, so Chait deserves to be taken seriously.  He starts with psychological rather than textual analysis -- speculation about what I really think yet feel compelled to disguise. He says I'm a moderate Democrat with a fixation on seeming nonpartisan. Actually, I just agree with Democrats about some things and with Republicans about others -- a fairly straightforward worldview, if you ask me, but one that Chait finds entirely bewildering. We could wonder about the reasons, but let's not bother.  Turning to content, Chait chiefly attacks the premise of my argument -- that Republicans haven't suffered as much from the debt-ceiling debacle as one might have expected. This is an "utterly false belief," he says. Not just false -- utterly false.   It's true that Republicans have gotten the blame for the shutdown, and rightly so. The column says their ratings have fallen (and not by "just a smidge," which is Chait's gloss on what I wrote). It also says that the Tea Party's debt-ceiling strategists and their supporters in Congress have shown themselves unfit for public office. In other words, one might have expected (and hoped for) a rout. That's not what we saw.   Chait doesn't question the poll numbers I include in the column, which suggest the Republicans haven't suffered huge damage, but he supplies links to  reports  of  other  polls, implying that these say the opposite. It's true that polls show the party's favorability ratings sinking to all-time lows -- but they were very low to start with. And there's been no surge of support for President Barack Obama or the Democrats. Isn't that odd?  One of the articles  Chait links to in claiming my premise is "utterly false" says:   Measured against the outrageous recklessness of the debt-ceiling maneuvers, this looks to me like getting off lightly. And the question isn't just "Why aren't Americans angrier with the Republicans?" Yes, they're pretty angry -- but not so angry that they're rushing to support the Democrats.   I think that's a puzzle that calls for some reflection. The column offers some. Chait's view appears to be that there's no puzzle: The backlash has been ferocious and the rational not-entirely-clueless part of the electorate (maybe 60 percent of voters) has finally seen Republicans for what they are. So is the party therefore finished? We'll find out. (Clive Crook is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow him  on Twitter @clive_crook.)
