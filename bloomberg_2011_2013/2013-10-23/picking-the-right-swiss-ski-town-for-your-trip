Question:  Alissa T. Answer: Alissa, while I've skied the Dolomites, the Pyrenees, and the Austrian Alps, I'm afraid I haven't hit the slopes in Switzerland yet (although it's certainly on my To Do List). So I turned to the person who knows more about sporty winter adventures in the Swiss Alps than anyone else I know,  Jack Shaw of Epic Europe . Jack lives in Verbier, Switzerland, and has this advice for people thinking about or planning a ski trip to the Swiss Alps: Alissa, whichever Swiss ski town you choose, have a fabulous birthday blowout!
