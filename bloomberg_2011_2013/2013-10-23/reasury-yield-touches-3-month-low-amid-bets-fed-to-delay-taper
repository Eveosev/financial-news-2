Treasuries rose for a second day,
with 10-year  yields  dropping to the lowest level in three
months, amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will push back
plans to trim its bond-purchase program.  European, Japanese and emerging-markets debt also rallied a
second day and stocks fell as borrowing costs for Chinese banks
jumped. U.S. government debt climbed the most in a month
yesterday after a report showed payrolls increased in September
less than analysts projected. The data signal that the economy
had little momentum leading up to the partial federal government
shutdown that trimmed 0.25 percentage point from fourth-quarter
economic growth and cost the U.S. 120,000 jobs in October,
according to President  Barack Obama ’s chief economic adviser.  “Treasuries are getting steamy -- expensive,” said
 Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income trading
at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. “The Fed is still
buying. Everyone is telling you the economy is slowing.”  The benchmark U.S.  10-year yield  slipped one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.5 percent as of 5 p.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It reached 2.47
percent, the lowest level since July 22. The 2.5 percent note
due in August 2023 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 31/32.  The yield fell  nine basis points  yesterday, the most since
Sept. 18.  The new range on the 10-year yield is 2.42 percent to 2.58
percent, Franzese said.  Volume, Volatility  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped 14 percent to
$292.6 billion, from $340 billion yesterday. The average this
year is $315 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index yesterday dropped to 63, the lowest
level since May 21. The index, which reached a record low of 49
on May 9, climbed to 114 on Sept. 5, the highest level since
July.  China ’s benchmark money-market rate rose the most since
July 29 as the central bank refrained from adding funds to
markets and corporate tax payments drained cash. The  seven-day
repurchase rate , a gauge of funding availability in the system,
surged 47 basis points to 4.05 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  Global Debt  Germany ’s 10-year bond yield dropped three basis points and
touched 1.76 percent, the lowest since Sept. 30, after falling
five basis points yesterday.  Spain ’s 10-year yield dipped seven
basis points to 4.13 percent, the lowest since Oct. 2.  Japan ’s benchmark 10-year debt yield dropped as low as
0.603 percent, the least since May 9.  Yields on  Mexico ’s shorter-term peso fixed-rate securities
due in December 2014 touched 3.51 percent, the lowest on a
closing basis since the debt began trading in January 2005,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The MSCI All-Country World Index lost as much as 0.8
percent, its biggest drop in two weeks. The Standard & Poor’s
 500 Index (SPX)  decreased 0.4 percent after rallying to a record
yesterday for a fourth day.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 25.8 today, dropping from 26.9 yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data. A reading lower than 30 or above 70
suggests the security may be poised for a change in direction.  Term Premium  Treasuries are the most expensive in four months, based on
the  term premium , a model that includes expectations for
 interest rates , growth and inflation. The gauge was 0.14
percent, the lowest level since June 19. It has declined from
this year’s high of 0.63 percent set on Sept. 5, signaling the
cheapest levels of 2013. A positive reading indicates investors
are getting yields that are above what is considered fair value.  Treasuries have returned 0.6 percent this month, according
to the Bloomberg US Treasury  Bond Index (BUSY) , paring its loss this
year to 1.84 percent. The gauge added 0.4 percent yesterday, the
most since Sept. 18. The Bloomberg Global Developed  Sovereign
Bond Index (BGSV)  gained 1.17 percent this month, limiting its 2013
decline to 2.19 percent.  “This market can continue to grind its way to lower
yields,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at
Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. Tapering won’t happen “at least till March.
The economy is definitely not that strong. It doesn’t justify
significantly higher yields.”  ‘2.4 Percent’  An analysis of daily and weekly economic data through Oct.
12 showed weakness in such areas as retail sales, economic
confidence and mortgage applications, some of which was directly
related to the shutdown, said  Jason Furman , head of the  Council
of Economic Advisers .  U.S. payrolls grew by 148,000 in September, versus the
median forecast of a 180,000 advance by 93 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The gain followed a revised 193,000 rise
in August that was bigger than initially estimated, Labor
Department figures showed yesterday in  Washington .  The jobs report, delayed by the 16-day shutdown that ended
on Oct. 17, was originally slated for Oct. 4.  “If we continue to get poor numbers, 2.4 percent is the
level on 10s everyone is thinking about,” said  Thomas Roth ,
senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities
USA Inc. “We’ve had quite a rally. The market is certainly
positioned for that -- no tapering until March.”  Traders are pricing in a 26 percent probability that the
Fed will raise its benchmark overnight rate by its January 2015
meeting, down from 43 percent a month ago.  Economists predict the Fed will maintain its $85 billion of
monthly bond purchases until March, according to a Bloomberg
survey conducted on Oct. 17-18. The Fed purchased $3.15 billion
in Treasuries maturing between August 2021 and August 2023 today
as part of its program to lower borrowing costs.  Before the shutdown, most policy makers said the central
bank would probably reduce bond purchases this year. The Fed’s
next two policy meetings are Oct. 29-30 and Dec. 17-18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
