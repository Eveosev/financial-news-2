Gold futures fell on signs of
slowing purchases of bars and jewelry in  China , the world’s
second-biggest consumer, while the dollar’s rebound eroded
demand for the metal as an alternative investment.  China’s benchmark money-market rate jumped the most since
July as the central bank refrained from adding funds to markets.
Shanghai market spreads for gold have fallen to about $8 an
ounce in recent days from above $25 last week, and Chinese
demand “seems to be wavering,”  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  said today in a report. The  greenback  rose from an
eight-month low against a basket of 10 major currencies.  “Physical demand for gold in China may not be as strong as
it was, and the rise in rates there boosts funding costs for
precious metals,”  Bart Melek , the head of commodity strategy at
TD Securities in Toronto, said in a telephone interview.
“People are realizing too that the decline in the dollar
recently may have been overdone. We’re not seeing new longs
coming into the gold market.”  Gold futures for December delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
settle at $1,334 at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New York. Trading
was 39 percent below average for the past 100 days for this
time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Yesterday, the price
reached $1,344.70, the highest for a most-active contract since
Sept. 30.  Gold has tumbled 20 percent this year, heading for the
first annual decline since 2000. Some investors lost faith in
the metal amid a rally in U.S. equities and low inflation.  India 
is the top buyer of the commodity.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$22.617 an ounce. Yesterday, the price reached $22.83, the
highest since Sept. 20.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery declined 0.8 percent to $1,439.60 an ounce, the
first loss in six sessions. Palladium futures for December
delivery fell 0.9 percent to $746.10 an ounce. That was also the
first decrease in six sessions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
