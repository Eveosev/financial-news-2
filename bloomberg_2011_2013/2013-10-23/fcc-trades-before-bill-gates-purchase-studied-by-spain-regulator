Spain’s stock market regulator is
studying trading in  Fomento de Construcciones & Contratas SA 
just before the announcement that billionaire  Bill Gates  bought
almost 6 percent of treasury stock in the builder.  The regulator, known as the CNMV, is “examining and
analyzing” the trades as it typically does when there’s an
unusual stock move, Antonio Belmonte, a Madrid-based spokesman
for the watchdog, said by phone today. He referred to comments
made yesterday by CNMV Chairwoman Elvira Rodriguez at a congress
in the country’s capital. A formal investigation won’t start
unless indications of wrongdoing are found, he said.  A spokesman at FCC, who asked not to be identified citing
company policy, declined to comment. FCC shares closed down 2.2
percent today at 16.60 euros in  Madrid .  FCC rose 5.4 percent on Oct. 21, the biggest gain in two
months. Hours later, after market close, the Barcelona-based
company said in a statement that groups linked to the  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)  founder had bought the stake in the Spanish engineering
and construction company.  On that day FCC was the biggest gainer of the 30-member
Madrid Stock Exchange Basic Materials, Industry & Construction
Index, which increased 1.3 percent.  The stock jumped 8.3 percent yesterday after the news to
16.97 euros, compared with Gates’ 14.865-euro purchase price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
