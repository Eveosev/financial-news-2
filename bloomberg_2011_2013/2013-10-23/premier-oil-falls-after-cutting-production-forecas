Premier Oil Plc (PMO) , a U.K. explorer
with operations from  Brazil  to Vietnam, fell the most in a week
in London trading after lowering its 2013 production forecast.  Premier slid as much as 1.9 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since Oct. 16, after reducing its forecast to 57,000 to
59,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from 63,000 a day.  A gas-venting failure at the  North Sea  Huntington oilfield
this year and a leak at the Chim Sao deposit in Vietnam led to
the revision, the London-based company said in a statement. It
expects to pump 65,000 barrels a day by the end of the year.  “While our oil production is currently restricted by gas
export issues in both  Vietnam  and the U.K., this has limited
impact on the long-term value of those fields,” Chief Executive
Officer Simon Lockett said. “Plans are in place to address
these issues.”  Premier said in August that new projects in Vietnam,
Indonesia and the North Sea will allow it to raise production to
about 100,000 barrels a day in the “medium term.”  The stock traded down 1.7 percent at 334.1 pence as of 8:33
a.m. in London. The shares have dropped 16 percent since
reaching 400 pence in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
