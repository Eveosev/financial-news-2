Gasoline on the U.S.  Gulf Coast  fell
to a  six-month low  with refinery maintenance nearing an end and
supplies of the fuel at a seasonal high.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  in the Gulf dropped for
the seventh day in a row, declining 2.25 cents to 20.75 cents a
gallon below futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:46
p.m., the lowest level since April 5, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The conventional  CBOB grade fell  1 cent to 21.5
cents below futures.  Gasoline stockpiles  in the Gulf Coast region, known as PADD
3, dropped 2.23 million barrels to 74.2 million in the week
ended Oct. 18, according to Energy Information Administration
data. That’s the  highest level   for the time of year  in data
going back to 1990.  Differentials weakened as the peak of fall maintenance
neared, which may increase production, adding to supplies in the
region. Refineries including  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Lake Charles,
 Louisiana , and Borger,  Texas , plants and  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) ’s
 Baton Rouge , Louisiana, site are concluding work that included a
fluid catalytic cracker and an crude unit.  Midcontinent  87-octane gasoline  fell 1 cent to 24.5 cents a
gallon below futures, the lowest level since March 14, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, and the lowest seasonal level on
record. In  Chicago , 87-octane gasoline fell 4.25 cents to 23.75
cents a gallon below futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , narrowed $1.16 to $9.70 a
barrel. The  same spread  based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil, the
Gulf Coast benchmark, likewise dropped $1.16 to $7.20 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf was unchanged at a
discount of 5.88 cents to ULSD futures. The same fuel gained 0.5
cent to a discount of 8.38 cents a gallon in the midcontinent
and fell 0.5 cent to a discount of 9.5 cents in Chicago.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in  New York 
Harbor gained 0.12 cent to 0.75 cent a gallon above futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
