The St. Louis Rams signed former New
York Jets quarterback Brady Quinn after losing starter  Sam Bradford  for the season with a torn ligament in his left knee.  The Rams also re-signed quarterback Austin Davis, a former
non-scholarship walk-on at the University of Southern
Mississippi who entered the National Football League with the
Rams in 2012 as an undrafted free agent.  Quinn and Davis will be backups to Kellen Clemens, who will
start this week against the  Seattle Seahawks . The Rams today
placed Bradford on season-ending injured reserve.  Quinn, 28, was a first-round pick of the Cleveland Browns
in the 2007 draft and also spent time with the Denver Broncos,
Kansas City Chiefs and Jets. He was cut by the Jets two days
ago.  Davis, 24, was the Rams’ third-string quarterback in 2012
and competed with Clemens during training camp this year for the
backup job. He was released on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
