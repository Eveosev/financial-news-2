A wildfire that destroyed huge
tracts of bushland west of Sydney threatening lives and homes
was sparked by the army carrying out explosives training,
authorities said.  The State Mine blaze in the Blue Mountains region was
caused by “ordnance detonation on a live firing range,” New
South Wales  Rural Fire Service  Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons
told reporters today. The blaze has burnt through more than
47,000 hectares (116,000 acres) of forest in the Blue Mountains
region, destroying at least 10 homes and buildings, according to
the fire service.  The Defense Force said in a statement it was cooperating
with police and was conducting its own inquiry into the training
exercise at the Marrangaroo Army Range on Oct. 16, the same day
the fire started.  More than 200 homes have been destroyed in bushfires in
Australia’s most-populous state since last week, with about
120,000 hectares of forests scorched, according to the Rural
Fire Service. Bushfire property loss is expected to be more than
A$128 million ($123 million) with 987 claims received, the
Insurance Council of  Australia  said yesterday in a posting on
Twitter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
