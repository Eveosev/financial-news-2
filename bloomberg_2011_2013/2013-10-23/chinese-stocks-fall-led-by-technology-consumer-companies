China’s stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index for smaller companies capping the biggest two-day loss in 18 months, after money-market rates surged.  Leshi Internet Information & Technology (Beijing) Co. (300104) , the
operator of online-video portal LeTV.com, plunged by the 10
percent daily limit for a second day.  Inner Mongolia Yili
Industrial Group Co. (600887) , China’s biggest dairy producer by sales,
declined by the most in five months. Huaneng Power International
Inc., the listed unit of China’s largest power group, slumped
5.8 percent after third-quarter earnings missed estimates.  The Shanghai Composite Index slid 1.3 percent to 2,183.11
at the close, while the ChiNext index of smaller companies
plunged 2.9 percent. China’s benchmark money-market rate jumped
the most since July as the People’s Bank of China refrained from
adding funds to markets. The nation’s consumer prices rose the
most since February last month and Song Guoqing, an academic
adviser to the PBOC, said on Oct. 20 the authority may tighten
policy this year if inflation quickens.  “Monetary policies will be slightly tight for the rest of
the year as the pressure from rising housing prices and
inflation is building up,” said Wang Weijun, a strategist at
Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai. “The valuations of small-caps are too high and it looks like the bubble has started to
burst.”  The CSI 300 Index sank 1.1 percent to 2,418.49. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 1.3 percent. Trading volumes
on the Shanghai index were 3.6 percent below the 30-day average
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai
measure closed at the lowest this month.  Smallcaps Slump  Leshi Internet tumbled to 41.55  yuan , trimming its gain to
320 percent this year.  Beijing TRS Information Technology Co. (300229) 
slumped 8.5 percent to 18.97 yuan. Lepu Medical Technology
(Beijing) Co. lost 7.2 percent to 13.93 yuan.  The ChiNext index has rallied 84 percent this year, taking
its estimated price-to-earnings ratio to 33 times for the next
12 months. The Shanghai Composite trades at 8.6 times, compared
with the seven-year average of 15.4, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg.  A measure of consumer-staples stocks in the CSI 300 slid
3.1 percent, the second most among 10 industry groups. Inner
Mongolia Yili fell 4.1 percent to 48.90 yuan after posting a 132
percent gain this year through yesterday.  Tighter Liquidity  The People’s Bank of  China  has suspended selling reverse-repurchase contracts since Oct. 17, leading to a net withdrawal
of 44.5 billion yuan ($7.3 billion) from the financial system
last week.  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the banking system, surged 47 basis points, or
0.47 percentage point, to 4.05 percent in Shanghai, according to
a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. That was the biggest advance since July 29. The
overnight repo rate jumped 71 basis points, the most since June
20, to 3.80 percent.  With the economy on course to meet growth targets and
inflation quickening, the central bank may start tightening
policy, said Li Yiming, a Beijing-based analyst at Citic
Securities Co., China’s largest brokerage.  Property Curbs  Consumer prices rose 3.1 percent in September as food costs
advanced the most since May 2012, statistics bureau figures
showed on Oct. 14. Home prices in China’s four major cities
jumped last month by the most since January 2011, government
figures showed this week.  China may issue new property curbs in the fourth quarter,
the China Securities Journal reported today on its front page,
citing unidentified analysts.  Separately, China’s biggest banks tripled the amount of bad
loans written off in the first half, cleaning up their books
ahead of what may be a fresh wave of defaults.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (1398) , the world’s
most profitable lender, and its four largest rivals expunged in
the first six months 22.1 billion yuan of debt that couldn’t be
collected, up from 7.65 billion yuan a year earlier, filings
showed. That didn’t pare first-half  profits , which climbed to a
record $76 billion, as provisions were set aside in earlier
periods when the loans began souring.  Company Earnings  Huaneng Power fell to 5.55 yuan. The company said it posted
third-quarter net income of 3.29 billion yuan, trailing the
median analyst estimate of 3.87 billion yuan.  Sichuan province-based companies rallied after the Sichuan
Daily said the province plans to unveil investment projects
worth 4.3 trillion yuan.  Sichuan Road & Bridge Co. (600039)  surged by the
10 percent daily limit to 7.05 yuan. Sichuan Expressway Co.
jumped 10 percent to 3.42 yuan.  The Shanghai index has rebounded 12 percent from its four-year low on June 27 on speculation the government will take
reform measures to sustain long-term economic growth.  China may signal plans to ease the nation’s one-child
policy, encourage companies to increase dividend payouts and
start pilot programs to reform rural land rights and allow more
free-trade zones during next month’s meeting of the Communist
Party, according to Bank of America Corp.  There won’t be material reforms of state-owned enterprises
nor a major breakthrough in reform of Hukou residency permits,
