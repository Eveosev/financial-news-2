Black & Veatch Corp. has been chosen
to work on a water desalination project to boost supplies to the
world’s largest copper mine in  Chile .  The Overland Park, Kansas-based company that helps build
infrastructure from water and energy to government services,
will develop the marine works and desalination components on the
$3.4 billion Escondida water-supply project in the Atacama
desert, it said today in an e-mailed statement.  The project due to be finished in 2017 will deliver 2,500
liters of water per second, or 57 million gallons of water a
day, to the copper mine that’s majority-owned by  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)  Terms weren’t disclosed. Chile is the biggest copper-producing nation, and China the largest consumer of the metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
