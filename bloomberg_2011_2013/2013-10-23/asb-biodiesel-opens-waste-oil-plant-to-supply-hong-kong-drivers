ASB Biodiesel ( Hong Kong ) Ltd., a
manufacturer of biodiesel from waste cooking oil, said it plans
to source used oil locally and from countries in  Southeast Asia 
to feed a new $165 million plant.  The Hong Kong plant, opened today, can produce 100,000
metric tons of biodiesel a year from waste cooking oil, the
company said in a statement. That would offset 257,000 tons of
carbon dioxide emissions, or 3.6 percent of the city’s annual
emissions, it said.  “The biodiesel produced by the plant can be blended with
fossil diesel fuel, with enough capacity existing to provide
every diesel vehicle on the road in Hong Kong with a 10 percent
biodiesel blend,” Chairman Abdulla Saif said at the plant.  ASB Biodiesel collects cooking oil and as much as 550 tons
of grease waste a day from around 4,000 local restaurants
including outlets of Maxim’s Caterers Ltd. and  Cafe De Coral
Holdings Ltd. (341)  to feed the plant, Saif said. It will get about 20
percent of its waste oil from Hong Kong initially, rising to
around 45 percent, and will also import waste oil from countries
including Singapore and  Malaysia , said Chief Executive Officer
Anthony Dixon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
