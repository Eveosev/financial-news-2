Steel reinforcement-bar futures
climbed to the highest in four weeks on speculation that the
U.S. Federal Reserve won’t rush to withdraw stimulus and that
 China  will boost spending on construction projects.  Rebar for delivery in May gained as much as 0.5 percent to
3,661  yuan  ($601) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
the highest intra-day level for a most active contract since
Sept. 24. Futures traded at 3,655 yuan at 10:15 a.m. Beijing
time, bringing gains this month to 1.9 percent.  Barclays Plc pushed out its estimate for the start of Fed
tapering to March from December after data showed employers
added 148,000 workers in September, below the 180,000 increase
projected in a Bloomberg survey. China’s southwestern province
Sichuan will invest 4.3 trillion yuan next year on projects
including rail and an airport, Sichuan Daily reported yesterday.  “The expectation that the Fed will continue with its
stimulus helped spark a rally,” said Wang Yongliang, an analyst
at Beijing Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin. “Local spending will
increase steel consumption.”  The spot price of rebar was little changed at 3,491 a ton
yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  Iron ore  for May delivery, the most-active contract by
volume on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , rose 0.2 percent to 950
yuan a ton.  The commodity  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port
fell 0.8 percent to $134.30 a dry ton yesterday, according to a
 price index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
