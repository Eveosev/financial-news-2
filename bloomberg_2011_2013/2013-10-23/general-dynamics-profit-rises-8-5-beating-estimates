General Dynamics Corp. (GD) , the U.S.
government’s No. 3 contractor, reported third-quarter profit
that rose 8.5 percent and beat analysts’ estimates.  Net income was $651 million, or $1.84 a share, up from
$600 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier, the  Falls
Church , Virginia-based company said today in a statement. That
compared with $1.68-a-share  estimate  of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The company raised its full-year profit forecast to $6.90
to $7 a share, up from the previous outlook of $6.85 to $6.95.
The guidance assumes “there is no residual impact” from this
month’s partial U.S. government shutdown, Phebe Novakovic, the
contractor’s chief executive officer, said on a conference call
with analysts and investors.  Sales fell 1.7 percent to $7.8 billion in the quarter from
a year earlier. The company reported a backlog of $47.9 billion
at the end of the quarter, compared with $49.4 billion at the
end of the second quarter.  General Dynamics fell less than 1 percent to $87.46 at 9:40
a.m. in  New York  trading.  Business Jets  Higher sales of General Dynamics’ Gulfstream business jets
have helped offset some of the declines in military revenue.  Across-the-board  federal budget  cuts stripped $37 billion
from Pentagon programs in the year ended Sept. 30 and will cut
about $50 billion from planned spending in the current fiscal
year.  General Dynamics, which makes Abrams tanks, has risen 27
percent this year through yesterday. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index gained 23 percent during the same period.  The No. 1 federal contractor,  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ,
yesterday raised its full-year forecast as its third-quarter
profit rose 16 percent.  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , the No. 6 contractor, yesterday
reduced its sales forecast for the year. The Hartford,
Connecticut-based company said Pentagon spending cuts
contributed to a decline in sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
