Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures gained as
more corporate earnings beat analysts’ estimates.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for October delivery rose 0.2
percent to 6,240 at 9:49 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index fell less than 0.1 percent to 6,202.80 yesterday.
The S&P BSE Sensex declined 0.1 percent. The Bank of  New York 
Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares lost less than 0.1
percent. The rupee weakened for a third day on speculation
resurgent inflation will force the Reserve Bank of India to
raise borrowing costs at its policy meeting on Oct. 29.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , India’s third-largest software services
provider, reported after the market closed yesterday that net
income for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 20 percent to
19.3 billion rupees ($313 million), compared with the median
estimate of 18.4 billion rupees in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts. All eight Sensex companies that have released
quarterly earnings so far have beaten or matched forecasts.  “The results season is as good as we’ve seen in the recent
past,” Ambareesh Baliga, managing partner of global wealth
management at Mumbai-based Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd.,
said in an interview on Bloomberg TV India yesterday. “However,
for markets to create new highs and sustain them will be very
difficult from here.”  Earnings Reports  Asian stocks rose today, with the benchmark MSCI Asia
Pacific Index trading near a five-year high, amid speculation
the Federal Reserve will delay cutting economic stimulus until
next year after U.S. payrolls rose less than forecast.  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL) , the biggest motorcycle maker, may say
today its second-quarter profit increased to 4.53 billion
rupees, according the median estimate of 43 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Cement makers  ACC Ltd. (ACC)  and  Ambuja Cements Ltd. (ACEM)  also
announce earnings today. ACC may report net income of 1.69
billion rupees, according to a Bloomberg survey of 21 analysts,
while profit at Ambuja may be 2.19 billion rupees, 33 analysts
forecast.  International investors bought a net $163 million of stocks
on Oct. 21, a 12th straight day of purchases, data from the
market regulator show. That brought this year’s inflows to a net
$15.1 billion, the second-highest after Japan among 10 Asian
markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Foreign funds have bought a net $1.66 billion of local
shares this month, adding to inflows of $2 billion in September.  The Sensex has risen 7.4 percent this year and is  valued  at
14.1 times estimated 12-month profits, compared with the MSCI
