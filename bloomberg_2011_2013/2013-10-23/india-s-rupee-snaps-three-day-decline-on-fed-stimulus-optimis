India’s rupee snapped a three-day
loss as U.S. jobs data that missed economists’ estimates spurred
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will prolong stimulus that’s
buoyed  emerging markets .  Employers in the world’s largest economy added 148,000
workers in September, short of the 180,000 gain projected in a
Bloomberg survey, an official report showed yesterday. Global
funds bought a net $1.7 billion of Indian stocks this month
through Oct. 21, exchange data show, while holdings of  debt  were
cut by $1.2 billion. The Fed, which signaled in May that it may
start reducing its $85 billion of monthly debt buying, has so
far refrained from paring the purchases.  “Against the backdrop of delayed tapering, equity capital
inflows to  Asia  have continued their steep recovery since the
beginning of September,” analysts at Credit Agricole CIB,
including Hong Kong-based Mitul Kotecha, wrote in a research
report today. “The rupee’s ability to benefit is partly negated
by continued outflows from  India ’s bond markets.”  The rupee gained 0.6 percent to 61.28 per dollar as of 9:47
a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 24 basis
points, or 0.24 percentage point, to 12.09 percent.  Interest Rates  Rising speculation that the  Reserve Bank  of India will
raise  interest rates  to counter inflation even as the economy
slows is creating “unease” in markets, according to DBS Bank
Ltd. The RBI will raise its benchmark 7.5 percent repurchase
rate by 50 basis points by March 31, and may announce the
increase as early as this quarter, Radhika Rao, an economist at
DBS in  Singapore , wrote in a research note today.  The central bank, which boosted the repo rate by 25 basis
points last month in the first increase since 2011, is scheduled
to review policy on Oct. 29.  Wholesale prices  unexpectedly rose
6.46 percent in September, the fastest pace in seven months,
official data showed last week. Consumer prices climbed 9.84
percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards rose 0.4 percent to
62.74 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts gained 0.5 percent to 62.81. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
