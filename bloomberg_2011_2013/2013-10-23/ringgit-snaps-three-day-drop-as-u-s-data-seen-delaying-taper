Malaysia’s ringgit snapped a three-day drop after a U.S. jobs report trailed estimates, bolstering
the case for the  Federal Reserve  to delay reducing stimulus
that’s buoyed emerging-market assets.  Government bonds  climbed.  Employers in the world’s largest economy added 148,000 jobs
in September, less than the 180,000 median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey and a revised 193,000 increase in August,
official data showed yesterday. Malaysia will probably announce
a consumption tax in the Oct. 25 budget and is on track to meet
its 2013 fiscal deficit target of 4 percent of gross domestic
product, Weiwen Ng, an economist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore, wrote in a report yesterday.  “The non-farm payrolls data is probably pushing out
expectations of a tapering from the first to the second
quarter,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a senior economist at Mizuho
Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “People expect positive steps on fiscal
consolidation at the budget announcement this week too.”  The ringgit gained 0.7 percent to 3.1493 per dollar as of
9:32 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has climbed 3.5 percent this month, the best
performance among Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 8.46 percent.  ‘Too Timid’  Fitch Ratings cut the outlook on Malaysia’s A- ranking, the
fourth-lowest investment grade, to negative in July, citing
rising debt levels and a lack of budgetary reform. Prime
Minister Najib Razak responded by raising fuel prices for the
first time since 2010 in September and said he’d delay some
public projects. The country has run annual  budget shortfalls 
every year starting 1998.  “Recent deficit-cutting measures have been far too timid
and will need to be backed up by more meaningful fiscal
consolidation to meet the government’s 3 percent of GDP deficit
target in 2015,”  Nicholas Spiro , London-based managing director
of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said in an e-mail yesterday.  The Fed will hold off from trimming its $85 billion of
monthly debt purchases until March, according to the median
prediction in an Oct. 17-18 survey by  Bloomberg News . Cuts were
forecast for December in a similar survey a month earlier.  The yield on the 3.26 percent Malaysian sovereign bonds due
March 2018 fell two basis points to 3.38 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
