Safaricom Ltd.,   East Africa ’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, rose the most in two weeks as
investors speculated first-half results will show a momentum in
earnings is continuing.  The stock climbed 1.1 percent to 9.05 shillings by the
close in Nairobi, the capital, the biggest advance since Oct. 8.
About 45 million shares changed hands, equivalent to 2.8 times
the three-month daily average.  “There is a lot of trading ahead of results,” Eric Musau,
an analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Ltd., said by
phone today.  Safaricom Ltd., Kenya’s biggest company by market value,
said in November net income for the six months through September
2012 almost doubled as voice and data revenues jumped. Profit
surged to 7.77 billion shillings ($91.7 million) from 4.01
billion shillings a year earlier. The company is scheduled to
announce its results next month.  “I estimate a growth of 30 percent” in earnings as
momentum from last year continues, Musau said.  Safaricom, which is 40 percent owned by Vodafone Plc,
surged 79 percent this year, the fourth-best performer on the
FTSE NSE  Kenya  25 Share Index, which added 36 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
