Japan ’s output of copper and copper-alloy fabricated products grew for a third straight month in
September as demand for exports rose, an industry group said.  Production, including sheets and tubes, rose 4.5 percent to
66,540 metric tons last month from a year earlier, the Japan
Copper & Brass Association said today in a statement, citing
preliminary data. Output was 58,529 tons in August, up 0.7
percent from a year ago.  Japan’s total exports slowed in September to the weakest
pace in three months, underscoring the challenge for Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe in spurring growth in the world’s third-biggest economy. Shipments increased 11.5 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a 14.6 percent gain in August, a finance
ministry report showed Oct. 21.  The industry’s production for exports rose 12 percent to
11,381 tons last month from a year earlier, expanding for a
sixth month, the group said. Output for domestic consumption
gained for the first time in 11 months, rising 3 percent to
55,159 tons, according to the association.  The country’s copper wire and cable  shipments (JNTBEXPY)  increased 3.8
percent to 59,900 tons in September from a year earlier, the
 Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Makers’ Association  said on
Oct. 18. Shipments totaled 54,696 tons in August, down 1.8
percent from a year earlier, data showed.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell 0.8 percent to $7,275.25 ton at 11:53 a.m. in
 Tokyo , brining losses this year to 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
