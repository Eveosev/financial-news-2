Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s biggest
seed company, promoted 30-year veteran Brett Begemann to chief
operating officer in a role once held by Chief Executive Officer
Hugh Grant.  Begemann, who was formerly chief commercial officer,
retains his title of president, St. Louis-based Monsanto said
today in a statement. He continues to be responsible for
worldwide sales and operations and now also oversees corporate
affairs, Monsanto said.  Grant, 55, continues to serve as chairman and CEO with
responsibility for long-term corporate strategy, Monsanto said.
Begemann, 52, joined Monsanto in 1983 and has worked in sales,
marketing, commercial development and in various management
positions around the world. Grant was COO prior to his promotion
to CEO in 2003.  “Brett has repeatedly demonstrated his strength in
strategic planning, operational excellence and delivering strong
financial performance throughout his career at Monsanto,” Grant
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
