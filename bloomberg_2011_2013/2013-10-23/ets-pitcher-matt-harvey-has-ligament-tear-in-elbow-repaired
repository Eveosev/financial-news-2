New York  Mets pitcher Matt Harvey
had a partial ligament tear in his right elbow repaired, the
Major League Baseball team said yesterday.  James Andrews performed so-called Tommy John surgery on the
damaged ulnar collateral ligament in Harvey’s elbow in Gulf
Breeze,  Florida , the Mets said.  The surgery was scheduled after Harvey abandoned plans to
try a rehabilitation program to strengthen his arm.  The team didn’t disclose how long it expects Harvey, 24, to
be out of action. Washington Nationals pitcher  Stephen Strasburg 
needed almost a year before he returned to the mound after
similar surgery.  In his second year with the Mets, Harvey was one of
baseball’s most dominant pitchers this season, going 9-5 with a
2.27 earned run average in 178 1/3 innings and striking out 191
batters. He started the All-Star Game at the Mets’ Citi Field.  The procedure is named after the former major league
pitcher who first had the surgery in 1974.  To contact the reporter on this story:
