South Africa ’s  inflation  rate fell
to within the central bank’s target range from a four-year high
as lower fuel prices eased transport costs in September.  Inflation decelerated to 6 percent from 6.4 percent in
August, the Pretoria-based statistics office said on its website
today. The gauge was in line with the  median estimate  of 26
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Consumer prices increased 0.5
percent in the month.  Gasoline “did all the work,” Ilke van Zyl, an economist
at Vunani Securities Ltd. in Johannesburg, said by phone. “It’s
taking temporary pressure off inflation worries.”  Policy makers are trying to balance risks from price
pressures following a 14 percent drop in the value of the rand
against the dollar this year with forecasts of the slowest
economic growth since a recession in 2009. The central bank has
kept the benchmark  interest rate  at a 30-year low of 5 percent
since July 2012. Inflation breached the bank’s 3 percent to 6
percent target in July for the first time in 15 months. Price
growth probably peaked in the third quarter, according to the
 Reserve Bank .  Gasoline inflation slowed to 12.8 percent in September from
22.3 percent in the previous month.  The inflation data is “definitely rates-neutral,” Van Zyl
said. “The exchange-rate weakness is still ongoing.”  The rand is the worst performer against the dollar this
year among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, declining
14 percent. It fell 0.6 percent to 9.7957 per dollar by 11:10
a.m. in Johannesburg. South African forward-rate agreements
starting in 12 months, used to lock in borrowing costs, dropped
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.78 percent, the
lowest levels since June 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
