Facebook Inc. (FB)  is tightening
restrictions on graphic content, altering its rules after a
recent video on the site of a beheading incited an uproar.  “When we review content that is reported to us, we will
take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent
image or video,” the Menlo Park, California-based company  said 
yesterday on its website. Facebook said it “will remove content
that celebrates violence.”  Facebook will also consider whether the person posting the
content is being responsible by only sharing with age-appropriate users and by providing a warning alongside the clip.  The company came under fire after the  BBC  reported Facebook
users were showing a violent video that included a beheading
earlier this week. Facebook said it has re-examined some recent
graphic images and taken them down.  “It’s irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos,
especially without a warning,” U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron wrote on his Twitter account following the reports.
“They must explain their actions to worried parents.”  With more than a billion users on the site, Facebook is
adding features to encourage greater interaction among members,
while trying to maintain some control over what gets shared.  The company has already put in place some restrictions on
content, such as videos posted for “sadistic pleasure,”
Facebook said. Users can still share clips that are “of public
interest or concern, such as human rights abuses, acts of
terrorism, and other violence,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
