New York  Giants center David Baas
will miss the rest of the National Football League season after
injuring his knee two days ago in the team’s win over the
 Minnesota Vikings .  Baas, a nine-year NFL veteran, was placed on the injured
reserve list, ending his season, the team said in an e-mailed
statement.  Baas had returned to action after missing the Giants’
previous three games with a neck injury. He was hurt on the last
offensive snap of a 17-play, first-quarter drive that ended with
a field goal.  He’s the second offensive lineman that New York has lost
for the season. Chris Snee was placed on injured reserve with a
hip injury this month.  The Giants (1-6) play at the  Philadelphia Eagles  (3-4) on
Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
