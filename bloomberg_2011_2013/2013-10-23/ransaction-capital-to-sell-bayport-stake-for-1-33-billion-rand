(Corrects Bayport Financial description in third paragraph
of story initially published on Oct. 23.)  Transaction Capital Ltd. (TCP) , the South
African financial services company, agreed to sell its stake in
Bayport Financial Services to Bayport Management Ltd. for 1.33
billion rand ($140 million).  Bayport Management’s acquisition of the 82.65 percent
holding values the company at 1.6 billion rand, Transaction said
today in a regulatory statement. The deal also includes the sale
of Transaction’s stake in Zenthyme Investments Proprietary Ltd.  Bayport Financial provides unsecured credit and mobile-phone packages. Bayport Management offers unsecured loans in six
African countries and Colombia and has more than 270,000
clients.  Transaction Capital acquired the stake in Bayport Financial
in 2010 and said it offered the potential to later buy Bayport
Management. The company said it’s disposing of the holding amid
“negative sentiment” in the unsecured lending industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
