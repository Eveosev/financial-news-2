Mozambique  will hire ex-military
personnel to set up a force to combat the poaching of
rhinoceroses and elephants in both its own conservation areas
and those of neighboring South Africa, the Joaquim Chissano
Foundation said.  The foundation, named after the country’s second president,
will partner the government in an initiative that aims to stop
the slaughter and illegal trade of rhino as well as reduce the
number of Mozambicans killed in fighting poaching, said the
foundation said in an e-mailed statement.  Mozambican poachers often cross a porous border into South
Africa’s Kruger National Park where they are shot in clashes
with rangers and soldiers.  “The prevalence of this illegal exploitation is not only
endangering the future of Mozambique’s wildlife, but also posing
a serious threat to its flora, besides undermining the
political, economic, security, social and environmental
stability of the country,” the foundation said.  More than 688 rhinos have been poached in South Africa so
far this year compared with 668 a year earlier, according to  the
government . About 418 of those have occurred in Kruger, an area
the size of  Israel .  Rhino horns and ivory are mainly smuggled to Asian
countries including China and  Vietnam . Rhino horn is believed,
falsely, to cure cancer and increase virility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
