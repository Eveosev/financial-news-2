Iraq , OPEC’s second-largest oil
producer, reiterated plans to boost crude output and exports by
the end of the year as demand from Asian buyers strengthens.  Production will rise to 3.5 million barrels a day by the
end of December and increase further in 2014, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi told reporters in Baghdad today. Iraq’s output
is about 3.3 million barrels a day, Deputy Prime Minister
Hussain Al-Shahristani said a week ago.  China and  India , Iraq’s two biggest customers, both
requested additional supplies next year, Thamir Ghadhban, an
adviser to Iraq’s prime minister, said in an interview in
Baghdad today, without specifying how much more oil they sought.
 Japan  asked for 300,000 barrels of crude a day and South Korea
sought 250,000 barrels a day, he said.  China  will import 900,000 million barrels a day to 1
million barrels a day of Iraqi crude next year while India will
purchase about 400,0000 barrels a day, Shahristani said Oct. 16.  The government intends to raise crude output to 9 million
barrels a day and export capacity to 7.5 million barrels a day
by 2020, according to Ghadban. An additional 150,000 barrels a
day of production will come from the West Qurna-2 field at the
start of 2014, al-Luaibi said.  Exports dropped to 1.82 million barrels a day last month
due to maintenance work, from 2.58 million barrels a day the
previous month, according to the Oil Ministry.  Ceyhan Pipeline  Iraq needs to replace parts of a pipeline that takes its
oil to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in  Turkey  in order to
increase export capacity to 1 million barrels a day, from
600,000 barrels a day to 650,000 barrels a day now, Luaibi said.  The country will sign contracts to construct new refineries
in Karbala and Nasiriya by the end of the year, Luaibi said.
Companies from Japan, South Korea, China and Europe are bidding
to build the Karbala plant, which will have a capacity of
150,000 barrels a day, Fayyad al-Nima, deputy oil minister for
refining affairs, said in an interview today.  Iraq’s refining capacity, excluding the semi-autonomous
Kurdish region in the north, will increase to 700,000 barrels a
day next year from a current 650,000 a day, al-Nima said. The
Kurdish provinces have a refining capacity of 150,000 barrels a
day, he said.  The government is in talks with Sonangol SA about giving
the Angolan state-owned company a year or more to start
operations at oilfields in Nineveh province in the north due to
security challenges there, Luaibi said. Iraq signed a contract
with Sonangol in 2010 to develop the Qaiyarah and Najma
oilfields.  Iraq produced 3.3 million barrels a day last month,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia, the
largest supplier in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, had output of 10 million barrels a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
