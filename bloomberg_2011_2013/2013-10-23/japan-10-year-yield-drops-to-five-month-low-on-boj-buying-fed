Japan’s bonds advanced, sending
long-term yields to the lowest in five months, after the central
bank scooped up  government securities  and in the wake of gains
in  U.S. Treasuries  yesterday.  The  benchmark  10-year debt yield fell as low as 0.6
percent, the least since May 9, following declines in U.S.
yields after a report yesterday showed payrolls in the world’s
largest economy climbed less than projected in September. The
 Bank of Japan  today offered to buy 800 billion yen ($8.2
billion) of bonds as part of a program to keep borrowing costs
low, stimulating growth and inflation.  “Japan’s 10-year yield could break below the psychological
0.6 percent level,” said Teruyoshi Sotome, a Tokyo-based senior
bond strategist at Mizuho Securities Co., one of the 23 primary
dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales.  Japan’s 10-year yield slid one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.605 percent as of 4:15 p.m. in  Tokyo ,
according to Japan Bond Trading Co. The 5-year yield touched 0.2
percent, the lowest since April 12, and the 20-year rate dropped
to 1.45 percent, the least since May 2.  U.S. 10-year yields declined to a three-month low today
amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will push back plans to
trim its bond-purchase program. A report yesterday showed U.S.
employers added 148,000 positions in September, versus the
median forecast for 180,000 in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Fed tapering has been pushed back significantly and it
would be difficult even in March,” said Shogo Fujita, the chief
Japanese bond strategist in Tokyo at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, another primary dealer. U.S. employment figures were
“weak,” he said.  The BOJ today offered to buy 250 billion yen in  government
bonds  maturing in one to three years; 350 billion yen of
securities due in three to five years and 200 billion yen in
bonds with maturities that are more than 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
