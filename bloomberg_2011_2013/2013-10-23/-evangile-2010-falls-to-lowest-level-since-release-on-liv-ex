Thirty bottles of the 2010 wine of
Chateau L’Evangile, in the Pomerol region of Bordeaux, sold for
1,700 pounds ($2,750) a case on  London ’s Liv-ex this week, the
lowest level since it started trading in June 2011.  The transaction on Oct. 22, involving bottles packed as
five half-cases, was priced 19 percent below this year’s high of
2,100 pounds in May and down from levels of between 2,067 pounds
and 2,306 pounds a case in June 2011, soon after its release to
the market, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The 26 percent drop in the 2010 vintage of L’Evangile from
its June 2011 peak is less than the 31 percent decline in the
Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index over the same period. Bordeaux wines
traded in London have generally slipped in the past seven
months, reflecting investor appetite for greater diversity in
their holdings as well as a sterling rally since July.  “Demand is low but downside is probably limited and we
continue to await the elusive recovery,” Will Beck, partner of
London-based Wine Asset Managers LLP, said in a market report.
The fund has $20 million under management.  The 2010 L’Evangile is among the estate’s four most
expensive of the past 15 years, lagging behind the 2009 and 2000
vintages and level with the 2005, according to merchant data
compiled by Liv-ex. It was rated 98+ on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , the vineyard’s highest-ranked vintage
of the past 10 years after the 2009, which scored a perfect 100.  Vineyard Roots  The estate, on the right bank of the Dordogne, traces its
history back to the mid-eighteenth century. It was acquired in
1990 by Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite), which also owns
Chateau Lafite Rothschild and neighboring Chateau Duhart-Milon
in Pauillac as well as Chateau Rieussec in Sauternes and
vineyards in southern  France ,  Chile  and  Argentina .  L’Evangile’s vineyards cover 16 hectares (40 acres) in
Pomerol, close to  Chateau Petrus  and Chateau Cheval Blanc, and
the wine consists of 80 percent to 90 percent Merlot and the
remainder Cabernet Franc. It also produces a second wine, Blason
de l’Evangile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
