Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) , the
United Arab Emirates’ fourth-biggest bank, reported a 47 percent
jump in third-quarter profit, beating analyst estimates, as non-interest income surged and charges declined.  Net income rose to 874.2 million dirhams ($238 million),
compared with 594.2 million dirhams a year ago, the state-controlled bank said in a  statement  to the Abu Dhabi bourse
today. That beat the 795.6 million dirham  mean estimate  of five
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Non-interest income rose 37
percent, while impairment allowances declined 42 percent.  The higher non-interest income resulted from “gains
arising on retirement of financial liabilities and related
hedges on the repayment of tier 2 loans” to the government and
higher net trading income, according to the statement. ADCB’s
non-performing loans ratio improved to 4.6 percent from 5.8
percent a year earlier, while provisions covered 105 percent of
bad loans, compared with 82.2 percent at year’s-end.  Banks in the U.A.E., the second-biggest Arab economy, are
recovering from the credit crisis which led to a jump in loan
defaults, slowed lending and hurt investment banking income.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank said its loan book fell 2 percent
in the nine months through September to 120.2 billion dirhams
after a $2 billion loan was repaid to the bank in the quarter.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank is one of the biggest lenders to
state-owned Dubai World, which roiled global markets in 2009
with its plan to restructure $25 billion of debt.  The bank’s shares did not trade today. They have risen 64
percent this year, compared to a 47 percent rise in the Abu
Dhabi market’s benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
