Bawag PSK Bank AG, the private
equity-owned Austrian lender, resumed a sale of subordinated
notes that it canceled last month as yields on junior notes fell
to the lowest in five months.  The Vienna-based bank, owned by Cerberus Capital Management
and GoldenTree Asset Management, plans to raise 300 million
euros ($413 million) from 10-year Tier 2 notes yielding 8.25
percent, according to a person familiar with the matter. The
average yield investors demand to hold junior bank debt dropped
to 3.49 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Euro
Subordinated Financial Index data show.  Bawag is following  Italy ’s  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and London-based
Standard Chartered Plc in raising Tier 2 capital as they seek to
comply with new rules designed to insulate taxpayers against
losses should an issuer collapse. It called off the original
transaction at a time when credit investors were concerned the
 Federal Reserve  was planning to taper its bond buying program.  “Bawag was talking about a Tier 2 at the start of
September, just as the market panic about the Fed taper was
reaching its most intense, so markets were volatile and investor
appetite was weak,” said Roger Francis, a credit analyst at
Mizuho International Plc in  London . “Today, worries about
tighter monetary policy are falling down the agenda and the
reach for yield is back on, so a long-dated Tier 2 issue will be
much more welcome.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
