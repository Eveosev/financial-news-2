Copper declined from a one-month
high as  China ’s money-market rates surged and after U.S.
payrolls rose less than forecast, curbing the demand prospect
for the metal in the top users.  The contract for delivery in three months on the London
Metal Exchange fell as much as 1.1 percent, the most since Oct.
9, to $7,249.75 a metric ton and traded at $7,261.75 by 3:13
p.m. in  Tokyo . The price lost 8.4 percent this year. It touched
$7,350 yesterday, the highest intra-day level since Sept. 20.  China’s benchmark money-market rate jumped the most since
July as the People’s Bank of China refrained from adding funds
to markets.  Stocks (SHCOMP)  in Shanghai tumbled as much as 1.5 percent
today. Data delayed because of the U.S. government shutdown
showed yesterday that employers added 148,000 workers last
month, below the 180,000 gain projected in a Bloomberg survey.  “Stocks and metals were hit by concern that China will
tighten its monetary policies to curb rising housing prices and
inflation,” said  Tetsu Emori , the chief  fund manager  at Astmax
Asset Management Inc. The U.S. payroll data also put downward
pressure on metals, he said.  China’s  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the banking system, surged 45 basis points to
4.03 percent in Shanghai, according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The consumer-price index rose the most since February last
month and  home prices  in four major cities jumped the most since
January 2011. Song Guoqing, an academic adviser to the PBOC,
said Oct. 20 the authority may tighten policy this year if
inflation quickens.  Copper for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 52,120  yuan  ($8,562) a ton.
Futures for delivery in December fell 0.9 percent at $3.306 a
pound on the Comex in New York.  On the LME, aluminum, nickel, lead and zinc also declined,
while tin advanced for a third day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
