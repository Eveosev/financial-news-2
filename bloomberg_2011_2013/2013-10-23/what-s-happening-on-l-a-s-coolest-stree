Gone are the days when Silver Lake was fresh, edgy, and undiscovered—nowadays, every visitor and their mother has  become hip to Sunset Boulevard  and its artsy boutiques. But now that Silver Lake's been overrun with tourists and hipsters, where are the locals escaping to for their fix of authentic vintage shops, artisanal gelato, and cafe con leche? Highland Park's York Boulevard, true Angelenos will tell you—it's the new  coolest street in L.A. Eat here: El Huarache Azteca  is York’s most legendary hole in the wall and the go-to spot for an authentic huarache (pictured): a flat bed of fried masa, stuffed with beans and covered in meat, shredded lettuce, cheese, and crema. Don't even think of getting a huarache anywhere else, and don’t forget the icy house-made agua frescas. The York  is technically a gastropub, home to the most underrated burger in Los Angeles and a killer menu that includes sriracha wings and pulled pork Cuban sammies. The York also has a great selection of local brews, comfy booths, and a fun, unpretentious crowd. Scoops  serves up artisanal ice cream in interesting flavors like Chocolate Guinness, Brown Bread, and Black Tea Sesame. There are many non-dairy options, too, and multiple samples are granted without even a sideways glance. Drink here: Café de Leche  has good, strong coffee (pictured) and are known for their delicious horchata con espresso. As you sip (or guzzle, whatever), make sure to admire thelocal for-sale art that lines the cafe's walls. Sonny’s Hideaway  is great if liquor's your chosen poison. The low-key spot offers up 1920s handcrafted cocktails that are wonderfully heavy on the bourbon. Soak it all up with one of the dishes from Sonny's New American menu (we recommend the bone marrow hash). Johnny’s Bar has great beers on tap and zero attitude. There's a mounted deer head on the wall, an old-school juke box full of punk rock records, and a ping pong table. What more could you want from a dive bar? Shop here: Platform  is a cool shop stocked with a constantly changing selection of art, housewares, jewelry, and clothing made by local artists and small-time designers. Textiles and paintings procured from global travels add a chic foreign touch; you're always guaranteed to find something interesting here. Galco’s Old World Grocery  is for the sugar addicts out there. A mainstay for over 100 years, its shelves are filled with sodas from every corner of the country, and as far away as Dublin and Jamaica. The shop's also a mecca for old-time candies, so stock up. Shopclass  (pictured) is packed floor to ceiling with kitschy, vintage home décor, random mid-century Danish furniture, and artsy old posters—very flea market, very fun. Prices put Westside shops of the same ilk to shame. More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
