Harvard University  is the unanimous
choice to win the Ivy League men’s basketball championship this
season in a poll of media representatives who regularly cover
the eight-team athletic conference.  The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Crimson received all 17
first-place votes after winning their third-straight  Ivy title 
last season and beating New Mexico in the second round of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  The University of Pennsylvania is second in the poll, after
finishing last season 9-22, 6-8 in the Ivy League.  Yale
University , 14-17 last season and 8-6 in the conference, is
third.  Harvard (20-10, 11-3 Ivy) is the first team to get all
available first-place votes in the poll since Cornell University
before the 2009-10 season. Junior guard and forward Wesley
Saunders averaged 16.2 points and 4.2 rebounds a game last
season and sophomore guard Siyani Chambers averaged 12.4 points
and 5.7 assists.  Harvard opens its season Nov. 10 against Holy Cross. Its
first conference game is Jan. 11 at Dartmouth College in
Hanover, New Hampshire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
