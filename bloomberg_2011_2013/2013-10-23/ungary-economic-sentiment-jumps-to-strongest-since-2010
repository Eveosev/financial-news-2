Hungary’s economic-sentiment index
jumped to its strongest level in three and a half years in
October on increased optimism among businesses and consumers.  The  index  rose to minus 9.3, the best reading since April
2010, from minus 11.6 in September, the GKI research institute
in Budapest said in an e-mailed statement. Business confidence
increased to minus 2.3, also a 30-month high, from minus 4.8  in
September, while the consumer-confidence gauge rose to minus
29.4 from minus 31.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who leads polls before
elections next year, is seeking to fortify the economy’s
recovery from a second recession in four years. Gross domestic
product advanced 0.1 percent from the previous three months in
the second quarter and the government predicts it will rise 2
percent next year.  Confidence improved in all business segments, with
construction businesses posing a “spectacular” revival in
optimism, GKI said. All businesses reported an increasing
willingness to boost hiring and an improved outlook for the
economy, while households see their financial prospects
improving over the next year, it said.  GKI’s indexes are calculated as a balance of positive and
negative answers to questions about the outlook for the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
