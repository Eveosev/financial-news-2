Billings at U.S. architecture firms 
rose in Sept., according to the American Institute of Architects.  Billings at architecture firms, tracked by the Work-on-the-Boards 
survey, rose to 54.3 in Sept. from 53.8 a month earlier. The inquiry index,
which tracks a firm’s capacity to take on additional work, fell to 58.6.
A score above 50 indicates an increase in billings, while a reading below 
50 indicates a negative outlook.  Commercial building construction typically follows the billings
index by about six months. Following is a table compiled from the AIA
