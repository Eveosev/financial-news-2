Rubber dropped for the first time in
three days as  Japan ’s currency gained against the dollar after
U.S. employers added fewer jobs than estimated. A stronger yen
weakens the appeal of yen-based futures.  The contract for March delivery lost as much as 0.8 percent
to 266.4 yen a kilogram ($2,716 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange and was at 267.8 yen by 10:53 a.m. local
time. The most-active contract fell 11 percent this year.  The yen rebounded to 98 per dollar after a U.S. Labor
Department report showed employers added 148,000 workers in
September, below the 180,000 gain projected in a Bloomberg
survey. The 16-day government shutdown cut the growth and cost
jobs, according to an economic aide to President  Barack Obama .  “Futures in Tokyo lost support from the currency market as
the U.S. data were not as good as expected,” said Gu Jiong, an
analyst at broker Yutaka Shoji Co. in Tokyo.  Losses were limited on speculation that the  Federal Reserve 
will maintain stimulus to support a recovery, he said. The Fed
unexpectedly refrained last month from tapering its bond buying,
saying they wanted more evidence of an economic recovery.
Deutsche Bank AG sees quantitative easing continuing in to the
first quarter of 2014.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.3 percent to 20,520  yuan  ($3,368) a ton. Thai
 rubber  free-on-board was unchanged at 79.55 baht ($2.57) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
