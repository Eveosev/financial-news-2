Ibovespa  futures  declined, after the
stock index rose yesterday to a seven-month high, as lower
commodities prices sapped the outlook for Brazil’s raw-material
exports amid concern growth in China will falter.  Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) , the Brazilian investment bank led by
billionaire  Andre Esteves , may be active as a person familiar
with the matter said it is preparing a bid for JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s physical commodities business.  Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the
world’s largest pulp producer, may move after posting earnings
that missed estimates in the third quarter.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in December sank 0.5
percent to 55,500 at 9:15 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real slid 0.5
percent to 2.1835 per dollar. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index
of 24 raw materials lost 0.5 percent. Commodities producers
account for about 39 percent of the Ibovespa’s  weighting .  In China, the benchmark money-market rate jumped the most
since July as the central bank refrained from adding funds to
markets. The Asian country is Brazil’s biggest trading partner.  The Ibovespa entered a bull market Sept. 9 after rising 20
percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 13 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 1.8 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in  Sao Paulo  yesterday was 6.45
billion reais, compared with a daily average of 7.61 billion
reais this year through Oct. 21, according to data compiled by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
