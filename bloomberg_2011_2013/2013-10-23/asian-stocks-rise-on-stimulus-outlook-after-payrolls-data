Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index retreating from a five-month high, after  China ’s
money-market rates surged.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s
largest lender, dropped 2.2 percent.  Japan  Exchange Group Inc.
sank 3.7 percent after the main bourse operator in the world’s
second-largest equity market didn’t boost its full-year profit
forecast as analysts had expected. Hyundai Merchant Marine Co.
jumped 14 percent after South Korea’s biggest shipping line by
market value refinanced 280 billion won ($265 million) of debt.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.8 percent to 142.71
at 7:31 p.m. in  Tokyo , erasing gains of as much as 0.5 percent.
The gauge had risen for four days amid speculation the Federal
Reserve will delay tapering economic stimulus. The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  closed at its lowest level in more than three
weeks as China’s money market rates jumped the most since July.  “The market has had a good run since the U.S. government
ended a shutdown last week,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based
head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
has about $130 billion under management. “We’re seeing a bit of
a correction. Chinese  interest rates  are an issue. There’s a
fear that the mini credit crunch we saw in June could return.”  China’s Shanghai Composite Index slipped 1.3 percent to its
lowest close since Sept. 30. The seven-day repurchase rate, a
gauge of funding availability in the Chinese banking system,
surged  47 basis points  to 4.05 percent in Shanghai, according to
a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. The rate jumped to a record in June as the government
engineered a credit crunch to curb speculative lending after
credit expansion outpaced economic growth.  Bank Funding  The People’s Bank of China has suspended selling reverse-repurchase contracts since Oct. 17, leading to a net withdrawal
of 44.5 billion  yuan  ($7.3 billion) from the financial system
last week. The authority asked commercial banks to submit orders
today for 28-day repurchase contracts, 91-day bills, and 14-day
reverse repos planned for tomorrow, according to a trader at a
primary dealer required to bid at the auctions.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index decreased 1.4 percent. Japan’s
 Topix Index (TPX)  slid 1.5 percent, while Taiwan’s Taiex index fell
0.3 percent. South Korea’s Kospi index dropped 1 percent.
 Singapore ’s Straits Times Index lost 0.2 percent.  Australian Inflation  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 0.3 percent, erasing
gains of 0.5 percent. The nation’s inflation accelerated in the
third quarter from the previous three months, a report showed
today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.9 percent to a record.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has climbed 3 percent this
month after U.S. lawmakers ended the government shutdown and
raised the debt ceiling. The gauge traded at 13.7 times
 estimated earnings , compared with 15.9 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 14.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The  S&P 500  climbed 0.6 percent yesterday, a fourth day of
record closing highs, on speculation slower growth in hiring
will extend  Federal Reserve  stimulus. That pushed the U.S.
equities benchmark to within a percentage point of the best
yearly gain in a decade. Futures on the S&P 500 expiring in
December fell 0.6 percent today.  Barclays Plc changed its estimate for the start of Fed
tapering to March from December after data showed U.S. employers
added 148,000 workers in September, missing the 180,000 increase
projected in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The data’s
release was delayed due to the 16-day U.S. government shutdown.  Chinese Banks  Chinese developers and lenders declined. Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China fell 2.2 percent to HK$5.28. China
Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s second-largest lender,
slid 2.3 percent to HK$5.87.  China Overseas Land & Investment
Ltd. (688) , the biggest mainland real estate company traded in Hong
Kong, fell 1.7 percent to HK$23.65. Shimao Property Holdings
Ltd., controlled by billionaire Hui Wing Mau, sank 5.6 percent
to HK$18.70.  Japan Exchange Group dropped 3.7 percent to 2,219 yen,
erasing gains of 3.3 percent. The company reiterated it expects
to earn 22 billion yen ($225 million) in the year ending March
31 even as it reported first-half profit that exceeded
expectations. Analysts had expected the bourse to raise its
projection to 29.1 billion yen, according to the average of
seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Nitto Denko Corp. (6988) , a supplier of chemicals used in the
semiconductor industry, sank 7.5 percent to 5,300 yen after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its rating to neutral from
overweight.  Hyundai Merchant Marine jumped 14 percent to 16,000 won,
the most since Aug. 13. State-run  Korea Development Bank  said it
purchased 224 billion won of bonds from the shipping company,
enabling it to refinance 280 billion won of debts that were due
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
