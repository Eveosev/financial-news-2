  Raymond James  Financial Inc., the
brokerage that acquired Morgan Keegan & Co. from Regions
Financial Corp. last year, posted a quarterly profit that rose
41 percent on a one-time tax benefit.  Net income advanced to $117.5 million, or 82 cents a share,
in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $83 million, or 60 cents, a
year earlier, the  St. Petersburg , Florida-based company said
today in a statement. That beat the 63-cent average  estimate  of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Results this quarter were lifted by a beneficial tax rate
and better-than-expected results in capital markets and Raymond
James Bank,” Chief Executive Officer  Paul Reilly , 59, said in
the statement.  Raymond James acquired Morgan Keegan in a $930 million deal
that combined two of the U.S. Southeast’s biggest brokerages.
 Capital-markets  revenue increased 7 percent over the preceding
quarter and asset management was up 5 percent, according to the
statement.  Raymond James fell 0.7 percent to $43.46 at 4 p.m. in New
York. It has gained 13 percent this year, trailing the 26
percent advance for the 81-company Standard & Poor’s 500
Financials Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
