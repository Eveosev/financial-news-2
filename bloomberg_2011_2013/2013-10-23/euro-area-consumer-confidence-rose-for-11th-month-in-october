Euro-area  consumer confidence 
increased for an eleventh month in October, adding to signs that
the 17-nation currency bloc’s economic recovery is gaining
momentum.  An index of household confidence in the euro zone rose to
minus 14.5, the highest level since July 2011, from minus 14.9
in September, the European Commission in Brussels said in a
preliminary report today. That’s in line with the median
forecast in a  Bloomberg News survey  of 28 economists.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Oct. 2
that the bank will keep key interest rates “at present or lower
levels for an extended period,” based in part on the “broad-based weakness in the economy.” Economists in a separate
Bloomberg survey see economic growth slowing to 0.2 percent in
the third quarter after a 0.3 percent expansion in the three
months through June.  Carrefour SA, (CA)   France ’s largest retailer, last week said
third-quarter domestic hypermarket sales rose for the first time
in more than two years as a turnaround gathered pace in the
euro-area’s second-largest economy. Sales declined less than
anticipated by analysts in Italy and Spain, respectively the
euro area’s third- and fourth-largest economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
