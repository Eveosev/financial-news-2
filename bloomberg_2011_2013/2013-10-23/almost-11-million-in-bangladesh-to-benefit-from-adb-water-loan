Almost 11 million people in
 Bangladesh  will benefit from a project loan to improve the water
quality and bring new supplies to the capital city of Dhaka, the
Asian Development Bank said.  The $250 million water loan approved by the Manila-based
development bank for improvements in the fastest-growing city in
Bangladesh includes plans for around-the-clock supplies to
connected households in six Dhaka service zones and a new intake
and pump station at the Meghna River east of the city.
The ADB will also fund a treatment plant at Gandharbpur.  The project is expected to take pressure off the existing
supply, reducing groundwater extraction by 150 million liters
(40 million gallons) a day and helping the cityâ€™s water
authority raise surface-water supplies to 1.9 billion liters a
day by 2021, the ADB said today on its website.  Dhaka draws heavily on groundwater with the current rate of
extraction not sustainable for a water table falling 2-3 meters
(6.6 feet to 9.8 feet) a year, ADB said. Total project costs on
completion in 2019 will be $675 million, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
