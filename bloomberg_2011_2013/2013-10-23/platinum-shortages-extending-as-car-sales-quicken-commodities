Platinum and palladium will be the
best performing precious metals next year as record global car
sales will keep them in short supply for a third year, according
to the most-accurate forecasters.  The metals, used in catalytic converters, will be in a
shortage for the longest stretch since 2005 for platinum and
2000 for palladium, Barclays Plc and Johnson Matthey Plc data
show. Platinum will gain 13 percent to average $1,635 an ounce
by the fourth quarter of 2014, according to the mean of eight
estimates by the most-accurate analysts tracked by Bloomberg in
the past two years. Palladium will gain 10 percent to average
$823 an ounce, the most for a quarter since 2001.  While gold and silver have slumped 20 percent or more
because of diminishing faith in them as a store of value,
investors are bullish on platinum and palladium. Growth in car
sales is projected to accelerate to 4.8 percent in 2014 from 2.7
percent this year, according to LMC Automotive Ltd., at a time
when metal stockpiles are contracting as mining companies fail
to keep pace with demand.  “Platinum and palladium markets show the tightest supply
and demand among precious metals and probably will throughout
next year as well,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt  and the most-accurate palladium
forecaster tracked by Bloomberg over the past two years.
“Industrial demand should stay high.”  Silver Retreats  Palladium rose 6 percent to $746.10 in  London  this year as
platinum fell 6.1 percent to $1,445.60. Gold dropped 20 percent
and silver 25 percent. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
commodities declined 3.4 percent and the MSCI All-Country World
Index of equities advanced 17 percent. The Bloomberg U.S.
Treasury Bond Index lost 1.8 percent.  Platinum will average $1,500 this quarter and palladium
$750, according to the Bloomberg News survey. The most-accurate
list includes the top five forecasters of precious metals, and
the remaining three are made up of the best analysts for gold,
silver, platinum and palladium individually that provide
estimates for platinum-group metals.  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by platinum
reached a record 73.3 metric tons valued at $3.4 billion on Oct.
18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investment in the
funds rose 61 percent since the start of the year, compared with
a 28 percent slump in gold held in similar products. The amount
of metal bought through palladium ETPs increased 16 percent to
67.7 tons valued at $1.63 billion.  Gold Council  Industrial applications account for about 60 percent of
platinum consumption and 91 percent for palladium, according to
London-based Johnson Matthey, which makes about one in three of
the world’s catalytic converters. That contrasts with about 10
percent for gold, data from the London-based World Gold Council
show.  Autocatalysts are the biggest source of demand for platinum
group metals. The canisters, which have honeycomb-like surfaces
that convert emissions into less harmful substances, are fitted
to more than 90 percent of new passenger cars, Johnson Matthey
says. Sales of cars and light commercial vehicles will reach a
record 83.2 million units this year and 87.2 million in 2014,
says LMC Automotive, a research company in Oxford,  England .  The world economy may be the biggest threat to the gain in
platinum and palladium prices. The International Monetary Fund
reduced its global growth forecast for next year on Oct. 8 and
now predicts 3.6 percent from 3.8 percent. The 17-nation euro
area contracted for six consecutive quarters and probably did so
again in the past three months, according to the mean of 29
economist estimates. The region accounts for 25 percent of
platinum usage and 21 percent of palladium demand.  Ease Shortages  While demand from carmakers for both metals will advance
next year, improving mine output will ease shortages. The
platinum deficit will decline 59 percent to 239,000 ounces and
that in palladium will narrow 16 percent to 686,000 ounces,
according to Barclays. Primary supply will expand 0.4 percent
for palladium and 2.1 percent for platinum, the bank says.  There are still existing stockpiles that can be tapped
should mines be disrupted by strikes or natural disasters. About
80,000 ounces of platinum output was lost through such events
this year, Deutsche Bank AG says. Inventories held at factories
or in ETPs are equal to 1,000 days of platinum consumption and
880 days for palladium, Standard Bank Group Ltd. estimates.  Metal Recycling  South Africa and  Russia  account for 86 percent of platinum
production and 80 percent of palladium output, according to
Barclays. Primary platinum supply will rise to 5.7 million
ounces next year, still less than the 6.49 million ounces in
2011, the bank says. Palladium will increase to 6.5 million
ounces in 2014, below 2011’s 7.36 million ounces. Both figures
exclude material from recycling.  The threat of strikes that South Africa’s government says
cost mining companies as much as 15 billion rand ($1.5 billion)
in revenue last year still exists.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) 
workers went on strike for two weeks from Sept. 27, cutting
44,000 ounces of platinum output.  Amplats, as the biggest producer is known, will report a
loss of 962.4 million rand this year, after losing a record 6.7
billion rand in 2012, according to the mean of seven analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of the Johannesburg-based company fell 5.8 percent this year.  Hedge funds and other speculators raised bullish bets on
palladium by 31 percent to 22,042 contracts this year through
Sept. 24, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Wagers on higher platinum prices jumped 69 percent from a 10-month low set in July. The CFTC hasn’t released figures this
month due to a partial government shutdown that ended Oct. 17.  “They are the quintessential industrial-precious metals,”
said  Bart Melek , the head of commodity strategy at TD Securities
Inc. in Toronto and the third-most accurate precious metals
analyst over the past two years. “Industrial demand is key in
driving prices. The big incremental moves will come from the
demand side. If we get a firmer economic recovery continuing
then this will bode well for industrial-precious metals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
