Jason Campbell will start at
quarterback over Brandon Weeden as the  Cleveland Browns  visit
the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs this weekend.  Campbell, 31, will become the third player to start at
quarterback this season for the 3-4 Browns. The Chiefs are the
National Football League’s lone undefeated team, at 7-0.  Weeden, a first-round pick of the Browns in the 2012 NFL
draft, was replaced in Week 3 by Brian Hoyer, who then had a 3-0
record as a starter before suffering a season-ending knee
injury. Weeden regained the job the past two games and fell to
0-4 as a starter following last week’s 31-13 loss to the Green
Bay Packers in which he was held to 149 passing yards and
connected on 17 of 42 pass attempts.  Campbell made the most recent of his 71 career NFL starts
last year for the  Chicago Bears . He had a 20-32 record as a
starting quarterback over his first four NFL seasons with the
Washington Redskins from 2006 through 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
