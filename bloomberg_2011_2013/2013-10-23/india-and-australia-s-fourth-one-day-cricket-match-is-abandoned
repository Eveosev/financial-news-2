Australia  maintained its 2-1 lead in
the one-day cricket series against  India  after the fourth match
in Ranchi was abandoned because of rain.  Captain George Bailey scored 98 and Glenn Maxwell hit 92 to
help Australia to 295-8 off its allotted 50 overs. It was
Bailey’s third half-century of the series.  India was 27-0 in reply when rain led the umpires to take
the players from the field. The game was officially called off
two-and-a-half hours later, at around 8.45 p.m., after the
umpires said the ground was too waterlogged to continue.  The seven-match series continues at Cuttack on Oct. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
