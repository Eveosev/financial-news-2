Chris Robshaw will captain  England 
for the rugby tests against  Australia , Argentina and world
champion New Zealand next month.  The Harlequins flanker resumes the position after being
rested for England’s Argentina tour earlier this year. He was
also left out of the British and Irish Lions squad that beat
Australia. He first led his country during the 2012 Six Nations
tournament in only his second full international.  “It’s a huge honor to be named captain and to lead your
country,” Robshaw, 27, said in a Rugby Football Union
statement. “We have some good leaders across the squad and I
know we will support each other as we head into a massive game
against Australia.”  Robshaw has appeared 17 times for England, 16 as captain,
including the surprise 38-21 defeat of the All Blacks last
December.  England plays Australia Nov. 2, Argentina Nov. 9 and  New
Zealand  Nov. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
