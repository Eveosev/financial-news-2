Investors in junk bonds will lose a
yield cushion of more than 1.5 percentage points as the Federal
Reserve winds down its unprecedented quantitative easing program
that’s bolstered credit markets for five years, according to
Martin Fridson.  “Tapering has been delayed, but high-yield investors
should nevertheless assume that the end of quantitative easing
will eventually hurt their returns,” Fridson, chief executive
officer of New York-based FridsonVision LLC, a research firm
specializing in speculative-grade debt, wrote in a report
yesterday.  The central bank said in November 2008 it would buy bonds
to ease credit conditions and in September 2012 began the third-round of asset purchases, now totaling $85 billion a month of
Treasury and government-agency mortgage-backed securities, to
aid economic growth and reduce unemployment. While economists
surveyed by Bloomberg had expected it to begin to reduce the
program, known as quantitative easing, in mid-September, concern
that job-market conditions weren’t improving stayed the Fed’s
hand.  Once quantitative easing ends, “the rise in long-term
Treasury rates that will almost certainly result will adversely
affect the total return of high-yield bonds,” Fridson wrote.  Yield Projections  Fridson’s analysis is based on economic forecasts from
William Cheney of Manulife Asset Management, whose projections
were closest to perfect for gross domestic product and the
consumer price index from December 2011 before the latest round
of quantitative easing, according to an analysis of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Cheney’s a good guide, Fridson wrote,
because the projection “of a forecaster who hits GDP and CPI on
the head is a reasonably reliable indication of what the rate
will be if the Fed does not change the game by instituting
quantitative easing.”  Cheney forecast the 10-year note would reach 3.4 percent by
the end of 2012, about 1.64 percentage points above where it
finished the year, which indicates how much QE suppressed
interest rates, according to Fridson, who started his career as
a corporate debt trader in 1976. That means  yields  now without
QE would be about 4.25 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
