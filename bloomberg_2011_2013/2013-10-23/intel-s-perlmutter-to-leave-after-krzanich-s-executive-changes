Intel Corp. (INTC)  said David Perlmutter,
an executive vice president who previously ran the chip-architecture unit, will depart the world’s largest
semiconductor maker in February 2014.  Perlmutter, 59, who has been at Intel for almost 34 years,
is leaving to pursue other opportunities, the company said today
in a filing. He shifted roles in May, when the Architecture
Group began reporting to Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich.  Krzanich, who was promoted to CEO the week before making
the executive changes, is trying to speed up Intel’s efforts in
mobile devices. While the company’s processors are dominant in
desktop and laptop PCs,  Santa Clara , California-based Intel has
struggled to woo smartphone and tablet makers to use its chips.  “Throughout his career at Intel, Mr. Perlmutter led many
of the product, technology and business transformations at
Intel,” the company said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
