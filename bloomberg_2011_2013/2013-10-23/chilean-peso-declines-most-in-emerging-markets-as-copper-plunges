Chile’s peso fell the most in
 emerging markets  after copper plunged as surging  interest rates 
in  China , the nation’s biggest trading partner, eroded the
outlook for the metal’s demand.  The currency depreciated 1.1 percent to 505.22 per dollar
at the close in Santiago, the weakest since Sept. 13. Copper
fell 2.1 percent, the most since July.  The peso has fallen 2.2 percent since the central bank
unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point
to 4.75 percent Oct. 17. Copper, which accounts for more than
half of Chile’s exports, tumbled today after China’s benchmark
money-market rate soared and its biggest banks tripled loan
write-offs. China is the main buyer of Chile’s copper.  “We’re facing a structural change after the central bank
cut rates,” said Alejandro Araya, a currency trader at  Banco
Santander Chile (BSAN)  in Santiago. “And people reacted badly to the
renewed financial tension in China.”  The peso approached the 505.83 per dollar upper limit of
its 20-day Bollinger band, a signal to some investors that the
currency’s drop will be hard to sustain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
