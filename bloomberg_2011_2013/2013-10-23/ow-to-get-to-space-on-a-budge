My father bought me my first science-fiction novel for my eighth birthday. By the time I was 11, I fully expected to become a space colonist. Some might argue that I did, in fact, become a space cadet, but from a strictly factual standpoint, it’s fair to say that my dreams were crushed. And given that I’m a journalist married to another journalist, I’m unlikely ever to be able to take a ride on  Virgin Galactic’s  space coaster at $250,000 a pop. But as with so many luxury items, it looks as if  the market is innovating a cheaper version : You don’t actually get to outer space; the ride only takes you a little more than 18 miles up. But it will feel spacelike: no blue sky, and you can see the curvature of the Earth. Again, given that I am a journalist married to another journalist, I’m unlikely to be able to afford a $75,000 ride, either. But who says innovation has to stop here? One reason I’m glad to hear this news is that the early government-led push into space seems to have stalled out. Unmanned missions continue, but we in the U.S. seem to have lost most of our interest in sending humans outward to reach for the stars. Or, at least, our government has. If these services prove successful, they’ll demonstrate that many, many humans are still interested. And that demand will hopefully provide a robust foundation for markets to innovate where governments have stopped. It does seem a bit strange to think that tourism, of all things, would help push humans into space. But who’s to say that the first humans left Africa because the tribal leaders wanted it? Maybe intrepid individuals just wanted to see for themselves what lay beyond the edges of their world.
