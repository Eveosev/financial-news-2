Bulgaria forecast 1.8 percent
economic growth next year, driven by exports and recovery in the
European Union after protests and early elections curbed this
year’s expansion.  Bulgaria’s economy is estimated to expand 2.9 percent in
2015 and 3.4 percent in 2016, the  Finance Ministry  said in a
three-year economic forecast published on its website today.
Next year’s budget deficit will narrow to 1.8 percent of gross
domestic product from 2 percent this year, the ministry said.  Next year’s “budget is focused on stimulating economic
growth, encouraging investment and employment and ensuring
social protection,” for the poor, the ministry said.  Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski came to power on May 29
after anti-austerity protests forced out former Premier Boyko Borissov’s Gerb party and triggered a snap vote. His minority
cabinet, backed by the Socialists and the Movement for Rights
and Freedoms, which represents ethnic Turks, has survived about
four months of street protests against what demonstrators say is
a corrupt political system and two no-confidence votes.  The government cut this year’s GDP growth forecast to 0.6
percent, from a previous estimate of 1 percent, as domestic
consumption shrank, the ministry said.  Bulgaria revised this year’s budget deficit to allow the
cabinet to raise borrowing. The Finance Ministry plans to either
borrow 360 million euros ($495 million) from German banks, or
sell bonds this year, the government said. The government plans
to allocate 500 million lev ($352 million) in next year’s budget
in a public investment program aimed at modernizing roads,
ports, water supply systems and other infrastructure projects.  The poorest EU country estimates foreign investment levels
will rise to 1.7 billion euros next year and 1.8 billion euro in
2015, from 1.54 billion euros this year, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
