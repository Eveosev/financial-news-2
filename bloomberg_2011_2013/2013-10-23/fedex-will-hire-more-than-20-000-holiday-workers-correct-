(Corrects to say spokeswoman in second paragraph of story
originally published Oct. 10.)  FedEx Corp. (FDX) , operator of the worldâ€™s
largest cargo airline, plans to hire more temporary workers than
last year during the peak holiday season amid increased customer
demand.  FedEx hired about 20,000 seasonal workers in 2012 and
expects to add more this year, Parul Bajaj, a spokeswoman for
the Memphis, Tennessee-based company said today in an e-mail.  The company will also increase hours for its 300,000
existing employees during the holidays, Bajaj said.  FedEx beat profit estimates in its most recent quarter
after cutting air capacity to Asia and moving lower priority
packages to cheaper transportation methods, such as ocean
shipping.  To contact the reporter on this story:
