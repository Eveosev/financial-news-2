Iberdrola SA (IBE) , Spainâ€™s biggest
utility, said regulatory measures in Spain and the U.K.
undermined profit, prompting it to reduce its dividend guidance.
The shares fell.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization were 1.49 billion euros ($2 billion) in the third
quarter, below 1.53 billion-euro average estimate of 10 analysts
surveyed by Blomberg. Net income was 546.7 million euros,
beating the average estimate of 520.5 million euros.  Iberdrola will probably pay at least 0.125 euros per share
to investors who want to receive cash rather than shares for the
dividend to be paid in January. That compares with 0.143 euros
paid at the same time a year earlier. The board set the payout
ratio at 65 percent to 75 percent of profit, compared with 66
percent last year.  Spain  has announced a series of power-market reforms
designed to plug the shortfall that has accumulated as a result
of selling power below the regulated cost and subsidizing
renewable energy. The measures include taxes on generation and a
reduction in subsidies.  Iberdrola fell as much as 1.6 percent, the most since Aug.
30, to 4.51 euros. It traded 1.4 percent lower at 4.52 euros at
9:15 a.m. in Madrid.  In the first nine months, Iberdrola said net income fell 3
percent to 2.27 billion euros and Ebitda fell 4 percent to 5.54
billion euros. In that period, regulatory changes in Spain had a
negative impact on Ebitda of 503 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
