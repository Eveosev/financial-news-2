Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest
coffee-shop chain, is opening its first Teavana tea bar in New
York as the company pushes beyond its signature drink.  Teavana Fine Teas & Tea Bar, on  Manhattan ’s Upper East
Side, will start selling hot brewed and iced teas, loose-leaf
teas, merchandise and food tomorrow, Seattle-based Starbucks
said today in an e-mailed statement. Starbucks said it will add
more tea bar locations in the next year.  Starbucks, which dropped the word “coffee” from its logo
more than two years ago, has been expanding beyond java, buying
juice brand Evolution Fresh Inc. in 2011 and pastry company Bay
Bread LLC last year. Starbucks acquired Atlanta-based Teavana in
January for about $620 million, the company’s biggest
acquisition.  “We are excited to celebrate the first retail example of
how our two companies are coming together,” Starbucks Chief
Executive Officer Howard Schultz said in the statement.  The global tea hot and iced tea category is worth about $90
billion, and tea is the most consumed beverage behind water
around the world, Schultz said.  The New York store is located at 85th Street and Madison 
Avenue.  Starbucks fell 0.3 percent to $80.64 at 9:43 a.m. in New
York. The shares gained 51 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a 23 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
