National Bank of Kuwait SAK , the
country’s biggest lender, posted a 35 percent decline in third-quarter profit after earnings last year were boosted by a one-time gain because of the consolidation of Boubyan Bank.  Net income  fell to 70.1 million dinars ($248.7 million)
from 108.1 million dinars a year earlier, the bank said today.
Beltone Financial and EFG-Hermes Holding SAE estimated earnings
of 64 million dinars and 85 million dinars, respectively. Total
assets rose 16 percent to 19 billion dinars at end September.  The global credit crisis weakened lending and investment
banking in the Middle East, pushing up loan-loss provisions and
causing a drop in the value of investments. Corporate lending in
 Kuwait  has lagged its peers in the Gulf Cooperation Council as
political instability slowed a $110 billion development plan to
diversify the oil-reliant economy and modernize the nation.  “We have started witnessing some acceleration in the
tendering, award and execution of some of the large projects as
the government proves determined to advance the execution of the
development plan,” Chief Executive Officer Ibrahim Dabdoub said
today in an e-mailed statement. The outlook “is turning more
positive,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
