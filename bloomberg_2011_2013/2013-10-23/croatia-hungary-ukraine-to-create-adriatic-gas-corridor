Croatia , Hungary and Ukraine agreed
to expand their existing pipelines to create a corridor that
will carry natural gas through the three countries and connect
to the planned  Trans-Adriatic Pipeline  in  Europe ’s south.  “The new infrastructure will enable us to send gas to
eastern European markets,” Croatian Deputy Foreign Minister
Josko Klisovic said by phone in Zagreb, adding the countries’
prime ministers are ready to sign a pact “soon.”  By diversifying gas supplies, the corridor will increase
the security of energy supplies in the region and help curb
Europe’s reliance on Russian gas after pricing disputes with
Ukraine disrupted shipments to European Union customers.  In Croatia, the corridor would connect to a planned
liquefied natural-gas terminal on the island of Krk, as well as
to the planned link to the TAP pipe in the south, Klisovic said.
The TAP, being developed by  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Germany ’s EON SE and
 Switzerland ’s Axpo, will ship 10 billion cubic meters of Azeri
gas a year to  Italy  from  Turkey ’s EU border, via Greece and
Albania.  The project may be financed by EU funds and interested
companies, Klisovic said, adding it was too soon to discuss the
cost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
