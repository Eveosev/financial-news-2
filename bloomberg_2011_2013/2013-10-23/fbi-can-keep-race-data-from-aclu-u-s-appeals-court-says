The Federal Bureau of Investigation can withhold data from a civil liberties group on its use of ethnic and racial information, a U.S. appeals court in Philadelphia ruled.  The American Civil Liberties Union sued the FBI in May 2011 under the Freedom of Information Act, seeking records that included the use of race and ethnicity by six field offices in New Jersey in conducting investigations. The appeals court upheld a trial judge’s finding that the information the ACLU sought was exempt from disclosure requirements.  “The harm from disclosure lies in revealing, indirectly, the FBI’s targeting preferences and investigative techniques -- not in revealing demographic information that is already available to the public,” the court said in unanimous decision.  The ACLU sought the records as part of an initiative called “Mapping the FBI,” prompted by the group’s concern that the U.S. attorney general’s 2008 revised guide for domestic probes would encourage unlawful racial profiling.  The initiative included a series of coordinated requests on the bureau’s use of racial data. The FBI eventually released 312 of 782 pages of responsive records. It withheld 284 pages as exempt, according to court records. The rest were considered duplicative.  ‘Undermines’ Purpose  The Freedom of Information Act, which requires the government to make non-exempt records available promptly to anyone who asks for them, was designed to facilitate public access to government documents, the appeals court said. Exemptions are allowed for records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes to the extent that production of such documents would interfere with enforcement efforts.  The court’s decision “undermines” the act’s purpose of ensuring transparency, the ACLU said.  “We are deeply disappointed by this decision, which denies the public’s right to know which New Jersey communities the FBI is spying on through its secretive racial mapping intelligence program,” Nusrat Choudhury, a staff attorney for the ACLU’s National Security Project, said in an e-mailed statement.  The ruling has “far-reaching negative consequences because the court has permitted district courts to use a secret and one-sided process to adjudicate potential FBI abuses of its authority to keep information from the public,” Choudhury said in the statement.  ‘Contradictory Evidence’  The appeals court rejected the ACLU’s argument questioning “contradictory evidence” behind that the FBI’s assertion that the disclosure posed risks to national security.  Declarations filed in the case by FBI personnel “explain exactly how disclosure of the requested ethnic and demographic data in each withheld document would interfere with enforcement proceedings: by revealing the target or focus of the FBI’s investigatory efforts,” the court said.  “It is hard to imagine how the FBI could provide a more detailed justification for withholding information under this exemption without compromising the very information it sought to protect,” the court said.
