West  Texas  Sour crude strengthened
the most in eight months relative to the U.S. benchmark grade as
pipelines in the area boosted flows after maintenance.  WTS, a low-density, high-sulfur crude from the Permian
Basin, gained $3.50 to a discount of $3.75 a barrel against West
Texas Intermediate at 3:40 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the most the grade has
strengthened in one day since Feb. 26.  Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL)  increased flows on its Mid
Valley Pipeline system to about 150,000 barrels a day on Oct. 18
after essentially shutting it for more than two days, according
to Genscape Inc., a Louisville, Kentucky-based energy
information provider. The pipeline carries crude to Samaria,
Michigan, from Longview, Texas.  Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  ramped up rates to the full
225,000 barrels a day on its Longhorn Pipeline to Houston from
western Texas, Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst for Energy Aspects
Ltd. in London, said by phone, citing a trade report.  WTI in Midland  strengthened by $3 to a discount of $3 a
barrel relative to its counterpart in Cushing,  Oklahoma . West
Texas Sour is also priced in Midland.  “The fact that the planned maintenance work on the
pipeline has finished and rates are increasing, that’s why
Midland grades are getting a little stronger,” Sen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
