Chris Froome will have to navigate
nine miles of cobblestone roads if he’s to retain the  Tour de
France  title next year.  The fifth stage from Ypres, Belgium, to Arenberg Porte du
Hainaut,  France , follows part of the course of Paris-Roubaix, a
one-day race known as the “Hell of the North” that has
treacherous conditions, organizers said today.  The Tour will start July 5 in Yorkshire, England -- the
first of three English stages -- and end on July 27 on the
Champs-Elysees in Paris.  Froome, the second straight British winner with Team Sky
after Bradley Wiggins, told Procycling magazine last week he was
concerned about a crash or mechanical problem on cobblestones
ending his chances of victory  “A mechanical problem in the wrong moment of the race when
things are kicking off could lead to you losing the Tour,” he
added. “I’m not a big fan of that.”  Froome, 28, would be the first rider to retain his Tour de
France title since  Spain ’s Miguel Indurain completed his run of
five straight victories in 1995.  Alberto Contador , who won in 2007 and 2009, had his 2010
title removed for failing a drugs test.  Lance Armstrong  was
stripped of his seven in a row, starting in 1999, for using
performance-enhancing drugs.  The 101st edition of the Tour has five summit finishes, one
more than last year, and only one time trial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
