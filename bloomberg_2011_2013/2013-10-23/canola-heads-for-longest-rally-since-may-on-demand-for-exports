Canola futures headed for the the
longest rally since late May on signs of increasing demand for
exports from  Canada , the world’s largest grower.  Shipments will climb 10 percent to 8 million metric tons,
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said Oct. 16. Exports are
climbing amid increasing demand from  China ,  Japan  and Mexico,
Ken Campbell, vice-president of North American Softseed Crushing
for Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., said in an Oct. 10 e-mail.  “You can be sure that the Chinese are probably buying
canola,” Wayne Palmer, senior market analyst for Agri-Trend
Marketing, said in a telephone interview from Winnipeg. “Big
crops usually have a way of working itself out, and it all gets
consumed.”  Canola futures for January settlement increased 0.7 percent
to C$505.70 ($486.95) a ton at 10:52 a.m. on the ICE Futures
Exchange in Winnipeg, after touching $506, the highest for a
most-active contract since Sept. 12. Prices are heading for a
fourth straight gain, which would be the longest rally since May
30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
