European stocks  declined, following
the longest rally for the region’s equities in 40 months, as
companies from Orange SA to  STMicroelectronics NV (STM)  reported lower
quarterly sales.  Orange retreated the most in more than two years as
France’s largest telecommunications company also posted earnings
that dropped in the third quarter. STMicroelectronics slid the
most in three months after Europe’s biggest semiconductor maker
also reported a $142 million quarterly net loss.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated 0.6 percent to 318.99
at the close of trading. The equity benchmark has still gained
2.8 percent so far this month as U.S. lawmakers agreed to extend
the government’s borrowing authority until 2014.  “Today there have been disappointing results from Orange,
formerly  France Telecom , and that’s definitely a drag to the
telecom sector as a whole,” Christoph Hock, an equity sales
trader at Alpha Wertpapierhandels GmbH in  Frankfurt , said in a
telephone interview. “The sector has had a massive run recently
and is in overbought territory.”  A gauge of European telecommunications stocks has  rallied
29 percent  from a low on June 24, while the Stoxx 600 has gained
16 percent from the same date. The relative strength index for
the gauge of  phone companies  has stayed above 70 since Oct. 9.
Technical analysts say a reading greater than 70 means an index
or security is overbought. If a second indicator also provides a
sell signal, the price may decline.  Orange, STMicro  Orange dropped 5.4 percent to 10.08 euros after posting
profit excluding some items that declined 7.7 percent as cost
cuts failed to offset falling sales. Earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of 3.37 billion euros ($4.6
billion) still beat the average analyst estimate of 3.34 billion
euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  STMicroelectronics tumbled 9.6 percent to 5.77 euros after
taking a $120 million impairment charge for the third quarter.
The company posted a $478 million  loss  in the year-earlier
period. STMicro also delayed a profitability target after
splitting up its venture with Ericsson AB.  Bankinter SA and Banco Popular Espanol SA retreated 4.6
percent to 4.34 euros and 2.4 percent to 4.07 euros,
respectively, as a gauge of lenders posted the biggest decline
on the Stoxx 600.  The  European Central Bank  confirmed today that it will
require lenders to have a capital ratio of 8 percent. It also
changed the rules for what qualifies as capital.  ‘Suppurating Sores’  “There are some festering sores suppurating in the
European banks which will have to be addressed,” Justin Urquhart Stewart, who helps oversee about $6.8 billion at Seven
Investment Management Ltd. in  London , wrote in an e-mail.
“European markets will take note of the European Central Bank’s
8 percent capital requirement for banks.”  Heineken NV  fell 4.5 percent to 50.46 euros. The world’s
third-biggest brewer predicted that full-year profit will
decline by a low single-digit percentage. It had forecast profit
would be in line with 2012. The brewer of the eponymous lager
posted third-quarter sales that missed estimates amid weak
consumption in central and eastern  Europe .  GlaxoSmithKline Plc lost 1.9 percent to 1,570.5 pence after
it said third-quarter sales of pharmaceuticals and vaccines
dropped 61 percent in  China . The country’s authorities began a
probe into alleged corruption involving the company in July. The
U.K.’s  biggest drugmaker  said total revenue rose 1 percent to
6.51 billion pounds ($10.5 billion), missing the 6.64 billion-pound average estimate of analysts.  Telecity Drops  Telecity Group Plc (TCY)  retreated 5.7 percent to 779.5 pence
after Bank of America Corp. reinstated the data-center operator
with an underperform rating, which is similar to a sell
recommendation. The brokerage said that the company has little
opportunity to increase prices because of new competitors and a
slow-moving market.  Celesio AG surged 6.1 percent to 21.73 euros after two
people with knowledge of the discussions said that McKesson
Corp. may agree to pay about 22 euros a share for a majority
stake in the German drug wholesaler.  Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY)  gained 2.8 percent to 27.14 kroner after
Europe’s third-largest aluminum producer posted earnings before
financial items and taxes of 597 million kroner ($101 million)
for the third quarter. That beat the  average analyst estimate  of
275 million kroner, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A report from the European Commission showed that a measure
of  consumer confidence  in the  euro zone  has climbed to its
highest level since July 2011. The index of  household confidence 
improved to minus 14.5 this month from minus 14.9 in September.
That matched the  median forecast  of 28 analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey.  National benchmark indexes in every Western-European
market, except Iceland, declined today.  France ’s CAC 40 dropped
0.8 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 and  Germany ’s DAX each
