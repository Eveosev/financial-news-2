Amyris Inc. (AMRS) , the biotechnology
company part-owned by Total SA, expects to supply Brazilian air
carrier  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4)  with sugar-cane based
biofuel for 200 flights during next year’s  World Cup .  The companies announced plans to collaborate on sustainable
fuel in an e-mailed statement today.  “The first milestone is to get the fuel approved,” by the
standard-setting body American Society for Testing & Materials,
Joel Velasco, a spokesman for the company, said today in an
interview in Sao Paulo. “Then we have to reach commercial
terms.”  The standards group may approve a 10 percent blend of
Amyris’s farnesene fuel with conventional  aviation fuel  as early
as December, Velasco said. Brazil’s fuel regulator Agencia
Nacional do Petroleo may authorize its use two months later.  “Gol is committed to making commercial aviation more
efficient and sustainable,” Adalberto Bogsan, a vice president
with the airline, said in the statement.  Amyris has a plant in Brazil’s southeastern city Brotas
that turns sugar-cane juice into farnesene, a 15-carbon molecule
that’s processed into fuel for buses and an emollient for the
cosmetics industry, Velasco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
