South African government revenue
will fall short of earlier projections as Finance Minister
 Pravin Gordhan  scaled back his outlook for economic growth and
tax proceeds.  Projected gross tax revenue in the year ending March 2014
was revised down by 3 billion rand ($306 million) to 895 billion
rand, while the target for next year was cut by more than 6
billion rand to 985.2 billion rand, Gordhan said in his mid-term
budget report released in  Cape Town  today.  The National Treasury is forecasting  Africa ’s largest
 economy  will grow 2.1 percent this year, down from the 2.7
percent forecast in February and the slowest expansion since a
2009 recession. The growth estimate for 2014 was lowered to 3
percent from 3.5 percent and to 3.2 percent from 3.8 for 2015.  “Personal income tax collection remains strong as a result
of high wage settlements and corporate income tax has been
robust,” according to the report. “However, lower domestic VAT
and excise duties point to reduced consumer demand and weaker
income tax collection over the medium term.”  Consumer spending , which accounts for about two-thirds of
demand in the economy, is projected to climb 2.5 percent this
year compared with 3.5 percent in 2012, the Treasury said.  Strikes at mines and carmakers and sluggish global demand
have hampered exports, curbing economic growth and boosting the
current account deficit. After widening to 6.3 percent of GDP in
2012, the shortfall on the  current account , the broadest measure
of trade in goods and services, is forecast to reach 6.5 percent
this year, up from the February forecast of 6.2 percent. The gap
will stay above 6 percent until at least 2016, Treasury data
shows.  “We are aware of the risks posed by the deficit on our
current account, which has so far been mitigated by our flexible
 exchange rate  but which over the long term requires fundamental
change to the structure of our economy,” Gordhan said in a
speech to lawmakers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
