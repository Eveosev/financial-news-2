Brandon Meriweather of the
 Washington Redskins  had his suspension for repeated illegal hits
reduced to one game from two following an appeal.  Meriweather will sit out, without pay, the Redskins’ game
against the Denver Broncos on Oct. 27.  Meriweather, a safety, initially was suspended two games by
the National Football League on Oct. 21, a day after he received
two penalties for forcible helmet-to-helmet hits on defenseless
receivers in Washington’s win against the Chicago Bears. He was
previously fined $42,000 for an illegal hit in a Week 2 game
against the  Green Bay Packers .  The suspension was reduced following Meriweather’s hearing
with former New York Jets defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell,
who is jointly appointed and compensated by the NFL and the NFL
Players Association to hear and decide appeals for on-field
player discipline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
