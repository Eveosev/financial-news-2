Gecina SA (GFC) , Paris’s largest publicly
traded office landlord, raised its full-year profit forecast and
said earnings increased in the first nine months as lower
financing costs offset rent lost from property sales.  Pretax profit excluding changes in asset values and other
items, known as net recurrent income, climbed 2.1 percent to
248.5 million euros ($342 million), the company said in a
statement today. Gross rental income fell 2.2 percent to 440.3
million euros while occupancy increased to 95.2 percent from
93.6 percent.  “Gecina is now forecasting a slight increase in its net
recurrent income for 2013,” the company said. It said in July
that the profit measure would be little changed.  Gecina, based in Paris, has been restructuring its holdings
to help cut debt. Net financial expenses fell 10.8 percent as
borrowings dropped, Gecina said. The company aims for a
portfolio that’s 70 percent offices and 30 percent other types
of real estate.  Gecina said it sold 175 million euros of residential assets
through September. It plans to sell the Beaugrenelle shopping
center, which opened today, following 10 years of “complex and
challenging” development work. Hammerson Plc, based in  London ,
is considering bidding for the shopping center, Chief Executive
Officer David Atkins said in an interview last month.  Gecina was little changed in Paris trading at 98.44 euros
as of 9:14 a.m. The stock has climbed 16 percent this year,
giving the company a market value of 6.18 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
