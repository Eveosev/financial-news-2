Palm oil gained for a fourth day to
the highest level in seven months on speculation that output in
 Malaysia  may increase at a slower pace, capping inventories in
the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for delivery in January advanced 1.1 percent
to 2,482 ringgit ($784) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the highest price at close for most-active futures
since Mar. 22. Palm for physical delivery in November was at
2,440 ringgit today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The growth in output has not been much and this will keep
inventory levels in check,” said Isha Trivedi, an analyst at
PhillipCapital India Pvt. in Mumbai. “The ringgit pared its
early gains supporting prices.”  Reserves dropped 32 percent to 1.78 million tons last month
from a record 2.63 million tons in December, data from the
Malaysian  Palm Oil  Board shows. Output in September gained 10
percent to 1.91 million tons. A new ruling that limits expansion
by plantation companies will probably hamper Indonesian
government’s target to produce 40 million tons by 2020, Joefly
J. Bahroeny, chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association,
said today.  Soybeans for delivery in January gained 0.5 percent to
$13.04 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest level
in two weeks,  while  soybean oil  for December increased 0.3
percent to 41.66 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for May delivery climbed 1.2 percent to
end at 6,178 yuan ($1,015) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  and soybean oil advanced 0.6 percent to close at 7,216
 yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
