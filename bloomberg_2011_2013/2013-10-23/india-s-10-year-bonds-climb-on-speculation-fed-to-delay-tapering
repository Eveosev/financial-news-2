India ’s 10-year government bonds
advanced for the first time in three days after U.S. jobs data
added to speculation the U.S. will delay tapering stimulus that
has buoyed emerging-market assets.  The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasures fell to a three-month
low yesterday as a report showed non-farm payrolls rose less
than projected, bolstering the case for the Federal Reserve to
maintain its $85 billion monthly bond-purchase program. Reserve
Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, who raised the repurchase
rate by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent last month in the first
increase since 2011, reviews borrowing costs on Oct. 29.  The yield on the 7.16 percent notes due May 2023 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.57 percent as of
10:06 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from the central
bank’s trading system.  “We see this job report as leaving policy makers
unsatisfied with the pace of improvement” in the world’s
largest economy, Michael Gapen, a senior U.S. economist at
Barclays Plc in New York, wrote in a report yesterday. “We now
expect Fed tapering in March 2014.”  U.S. employers added 148,000 positions in September, a
report showed yesterday, less than the median forecast of
180,000 in a Bloomberg News survey. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
has said the central bank may pare stimulus if the labor market
shows sustainable improvement.  Price Pressures  Increased price pressures will prompt the Indian central
bank to raise the benchmark rate by 50 basis points on Oct. 29,
Taimur Baig, Singapore-based director of Asia economics at
Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in an Oct. 16 report.  Wholesale prices 
in India climbed 6.46 percent from a year earlier in September,
the most in seven months, official data showed Oct. 14.  India’s 10-year notes fell in each of the last four months,
the longest such run since 2009, as the RBI raised rates and
curbed funding support to banks to stem a slide in the rupee.
The currency has rebounded 12 percent from a record low of
68.845 on Aug. 28, allowing Rajan to scale back some of the
measures. He has twice cut two rates at which the RBI supplies
cash to lenders in the past month.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points to 8.41 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
