Sheikha Mayassa bint Hamad  Al Thani ,
sister of Qatar’s Emir and chairwoman of the Qatar Museums
Authority, tops ArtReview’s 2013 ranking of the art world’s 100
most influential figures, the Power 100, published today.  Sheikha Mayassa’s notoriety soared last year when Vanity
Fair magazine reported that Qatar had paid $250 million for one
of Cezanne’s “The Card Players.” Having joined the list at no.
90 in 2011, she climbed to 11th position in 2012.  The Qatari royal was chosen “on account of her
organization’s vast purchasing power and willingness to spend --
at a rate estimated to be $1 billion a year,” Art Review said
in a news release.  Up three notches to No. 2 is New York-based gallery owner
 David Zwirner , followed by dealers Iwan Wirth and  Larry Gagosian . Hans Ulrich Obrist and Julia Peyton-Jones, co-directors of London’s Serpentine Gallery, rank fifth, up five
positions.  Several artists have landed on the list for the first time:
 Japan ’s Yayoi Kusama (67th), Mark Leckey (82nd),  Zeng Fanzhi 
(83rd), and El Anatsui (98th).  Steve McQueen, the visual artist who directed the movie
“12 Years a Slave,” rose 23 notches to No. 36 on the list.  Also new to the list: Jennifer Flay, director of FIAC, the
Paris contemporary-art fair, which takes place this week.  Last year, the list was led by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev,
artistic director of the 2012 Documenta exhibition in Kassel,
 Germany  and the first woman to top the Power 100. In 2011,
Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei was number one.  Below is the complete list as published by Art Review, with
last year’s ranking in brackets:  Muse highlights include  Scott Reyburn  on the art market,
 Jason Harper  on cars,  Rich Jaroslovsky  on tech,  Lance Esplund  on
U.S. art and  Amanda Gordon’s  Scene Last Night.  To contact the writer on this story:
