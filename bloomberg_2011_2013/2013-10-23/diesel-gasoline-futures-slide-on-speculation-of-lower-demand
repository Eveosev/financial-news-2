Ultra-low-sulfur diesel and gasoline
fell on speculation that the U.S. economy is struggling and fuel
demand may decline in the fourth quarter as the impact of the
recent government shutdown is felt.  Futures slid as employers added fewer workers than
projected in September, indicating a lack of economic momentum
ahead of the 16-day federal government shutdown that ended Oct.
17. The Energy Information Administration is scheduled to report
last week’s inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington .  “Products and the distillate side of the barrel in
particular are attuned to the perceptions that we’ll see a
slowdown in growth in the domestic economy in the fourth quarter
because of the shutdown,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery fell 4.43
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.953 a gallon at 10:15 a.m. on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, after touching a three-week low of
$2.9468. Trading volume was 68 percent above the 100-day
average.  The shutdown will reduce fourth quarter growth by 0.3
percent and the budget deal that ended it will prolong economic
uncertainty,  Ward McCarthy , Jefferies LLC chief economist in New
York, said in a research note on Oct. 21.  The 148,000 increase in October payrolls followed a revised
193,000 gain in August, Labor Department figures showed
yesterday.  Supply Estimates  The EIA will probably report that distillate supplies,
including heating oil and diesel, fell 1.8 million barrels,
gasoline stocks dropped 1 million barrels and crude inventories
jumped 3 million barrels, according to the median of 10 analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported
yesterday that distillates added 815,000 barrels, gasoline
supplies were down by 510,000 barrels and crude stocks climbed 3
million barrels.  ULSD’s  premium  versus WTI narrowed 14 cents to $27.37 a
barrel. The  crack spread  over Brent sank 74 cents to $15.10.  Gasoline for November delivery fell 3.96 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.5771 a gallon on trading volume that was 22
percent above the 100-day average. Prices touched $2.5738, the
lowest intraday level since Oct. 7.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI increased 8 cents
to $11.27 a barrel. The spread has more than doubled since
sliding to $5.68 on Oct. 4. The  spread  versus Brent fell 48
cents to a 96-cent discount, the lowest level since December
2011.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.5 cent to $3.339 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Prices are 30.9 cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
