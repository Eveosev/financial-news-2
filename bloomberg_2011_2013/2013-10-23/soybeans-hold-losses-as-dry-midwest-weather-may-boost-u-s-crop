Soybeans extended gains and corn
climbed on speculation that demand is improving as U.S. farmers
withhold newly harvested supplies. Wheat also rose.  Exporters reported selling 120,000 metric tons of soybeans
for delivery by Aug. 31 to  Russia , the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today. Russia  purchased  120,000 tons earlier
this year. U.S. ethanol production rose 3.2 percent to 897,000
barrels a day in the week ended Oct. 18, the highest since June
2012, the Energy Information Administration  said  today.  “The Russian purchase was a surprise and underscores
improving demand for U.S. soybeans from overseas buyers,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The pace of
farmer selling is very slow despite big yields, increasing
commercial cash bids. U.S. and world corn buyers are caught
short of supplies.”  Soybean futures for delivery in January rose 0.5 percent to
close at $13.04 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, after touching $13.1275, the highest since Sept. 30.  Corn futures for delivery in December added 1 percent to
$4.4275 a bushel, the biggest gain since Oct. 15. Corn fell 37
percent this year as the U.S. harvest is forecast to jump 28
percent to a record.  Wheat traded near the highest price in four months in
Chicago on speculation that South America may seek more U.S.
supplies after dry weather.  ‘Irreversible Damage’  The worst drought in 50 years in areas of Argentina, South
America’s biggest wheat exporter, resulted in “irreversible
damage” to the crop and eroded conditions for recently planted
corn, researcher Oil World said yesterday. About 20.58 million
bushels of U.S. wheat were inspected for export in the week
ended Oct. 17, up 25 percent from a year earlier, the Department
of Agriculture said.  “South American wheat in general looks pretty poor, not
only in Argentina, but in parts of Brazil and  Paraguay  the
situation is pretty bad,” Chris Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie
Group Ltd. in  London , said by telephone. “The U.S. is going to
get an awful lot of demand, and the balance sheet is going to be
tight.”  Wheat futures for delivery in December climbed 0.1 percent
to $7.0175 a bushel on the CBOT. Prices touched $7.1125 on Oct.
21, the highest since June 21. The grain fell 9.8 percent this
year as the USDA estimates global output may rise to a record
708.9 million tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
