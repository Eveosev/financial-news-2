Most companies in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index are finding quarterly sales projections from
analysts to be too high a hurdle to surpass this year.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, only 38 percent of the
index’s first 130 companies to release third-quarter results
beat the average revenue estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The
figure compares with 46 percent for the entire second-quarter
earnings season and 37 percent in the first quarter, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There haven’t been three consecutive quarters of readings
below 50 percent since Bloomberg began compiling the data four
years ago. While a majority of S&P 500 companies trailed sales
estimates in last year’s second and third quarters, 54 percent
exceeded the average projection in the fourth quarter.  Stocks have become expensive by comparison with revenue,
John P. Hussman, manager of the Hussman Funds, wrote two days
ago in a report. The S&P 500 is valued at 1.6 times sales, and
Hussman  wrote  that the ratio was about twice its norm before a
1990s bull market led by Internet stocks.  The price-to-sales ratio is among the indicators signaling
the index will deliver a 2.6 percent average annual return for
the next 10 years, the Ellicott City, Maryland-based investor
wrote. The S&P 500 returned 24 percent this year through Oct.
21, the date of his report.  Companies are meeting earnings projections far more often
than sales estimates, as the chart shows. Third-quarter profit
exceeded the average analyst estimate at 65 percent of S&P 500
companies reporting, according to Bloomberg’s data. That’s just
below an average of 67 percent for the previous eight quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
