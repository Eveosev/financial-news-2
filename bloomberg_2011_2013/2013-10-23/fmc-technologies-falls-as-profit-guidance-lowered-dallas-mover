FMC Technologies Inc. (FTI) , the largest
U.S. maker of subsea equipment for energy producers, fell the
most in more than two years after lowering the profit margin
forecast for its largest business unit.  FMC Technologies declined 8.6 percent to $52.80 at the
close in  New York , the biggest drop since August 2011. The
operating profit margin for the subsea technology unit is
expected to be 11 percent this year, Chief Financial Officer
Maryann Seaman told analysts and investors today on a conference
call. That’s down from the 12 to 13 percent forecast in
September.  “This is largely the result of a shortfall in the eastern
region, where we experienced higher project completion costs and
slower progress in optimizing our cost structure,” Chief
Executive Officer John Gremp said on the call. Backlog in the
eastern region, which encompasses  Europe ,  Africa  and  Russia  “is
down almost $600 million from where we expected.”  The Houston-based company yesterday reported third-quarter
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates as it lowered this
year’s earnings guidance to $2 to $2.10 a share, from a previous
range of $2.10 to $2.25. FMC reaffirmed guidance for next year’s
subsea margin in the range of 14 to 15 percent.  Customer spending industry wide on subsea valves, pipelines
and cables to build underwater oilfields will grow to a record
$13.9 billion this year, a 66 percent jump over the $8.4 billion
spent last year, industry consultant Quest Offshore Resources
said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
