New York City Opera , which filed for
 bankruptcy protection  this month after years of management
missteps, listed assets of $6.67 million and debt of $3.59
million in a court filing.  The holdings include $4.29 million in the defunct opera’s
Black Rock Investments accounts, $476,430 in its main operating
account at  Bank of America  Corp. and a separate “pre-paid
ticket” account with about $407,500, according to a formal
listing of financial affairs filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in  Manhattan .  The nonprofit organization valued its costumes, props,
furniture, crates, shop equipment, projector and lighting at
$10,000, plus a harp located at the Koch Theater at Lincoln
Center Plaza worth $0. Donor pledges of more than $441,000 were
also listed with the caveat that they are mostly uncollectable
as a result of the bankruptcy.  The opera company, created 70 years ago as the “people’s
opera” because of its affordable tickets, filed a Chapter 11
petition on Oct. 3 after it failed to meet an emergency online
fundraising goal of $7 million.  Debts listed in yesterday’s court filing include $1.64
million owed to  New York  City Ballet Inc. and a $44,000 claim by
the New York-based public relations company Risa Heller
Communications, which is still doing work for the opera.  Anna Nicole  New York  City Opera , which this year produced “ Anna
Nicole ,” about the late tabloid celebrity, asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane at a hearing on Oct. 10 to let it
refund about $323,000 in pre-paid opera tickets. That request
was challenged by a lawyer for union musicians who seeks to
ensure remaining assets are used to cover financial obligations
for orchestra and choir members, including pensions.  The judge put off ruling on the request and scheduled
another hearing for Oct. 29.  The opera’s lawyer,  Kenneth Rosen , told a judge at that
hearing that at least one other cultural institution may be
interested in buying some of its operations. The entity, which
wasn’t named, was referred to as a “potential partner” or a
“potential merger candidate” at the hearing.  The opera also has a potential nonprofit buyer for its
costume thrift shop, Rosen said at the hearing.  The case is New York City Opera Inc., 13-13240, U.S
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
