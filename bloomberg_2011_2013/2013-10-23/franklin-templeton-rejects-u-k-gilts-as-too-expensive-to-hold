Franklin Templeton Investments says
U.K. government debt is so expensive, it owns none in its
 European portfolios  unless specifically requested by clients.  Britain’s inflation-linked gilts are among the most over-priced bonds in the world, John Beck, a co-director of global
fixed income, said at a briefing in  London  today. Franklin
Templeton had more than $815 billion in assets under management
as of June 30, according to the company’s website.  “You need a microscope to see the coupon and a telescope
to see the maturity” on the longest-dated inflation-linked U.K.
debt, Beck said.  The Debt Management Office yesterday increased the size of
a sale of conventional gilts maturing in 2068 through banks to
take advantage of the “very strong support” and demand, Chief
Executive Officer Robert Stheeman said in an e-mailed statement.  The DMO sold 1.75 billion pounds ($2.83 billion) of 0.125
percent index-linked gilts due in November 2019 at a  real yield 
of minus 1.063 percent on Oct. 8, compared with minus 0.887
percent at a previous sale on Aug. 20.  Investors bid  for 2.77
times the number of securities allotted at this month’s auction,
up from 1.83 times in August.  U.K. inflation-protected bonds are outperforming their
conventional peers this year. Linkers handed investors a return
of 2.7 percent through yesterday, while gilts lost 2.3 percent,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. Global inflation-linked securities have dropped 2.5 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
