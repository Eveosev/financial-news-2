The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is meeting to consider a proposal that would allow
businesses to sell ownership stakes in their companies by
soliciting investors over the Internet.  The SEC plan being discussed in  Washington  today would
create rules for equity crowdfunding, which lawmakers intended
to ease financing for startups and small companies when they
authorized it in the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.
The rules may give a boost to the nascent crowdfunding industry
as they show the agency’s progress in advancing a backlog of
regulations required under the JOBS Act and Dodd-Frank law.  Businesses and startups too small or risky to attract
funding from banks or venture capitalists are expected to use
equity crowdfunding. Its success may turn on whether the rules
make crowdfunding an attractive way to seek money from
investors, said Rory Eakin, chief operating officer of CircleUp
Network Inc.  “If they craft rules that are too onerous on the
businesses, they won’t get the best companies and that will make
it more difficult for investors to find returns,” said Eakin,
whose company operates a funding portal that connects companies
with accredited investors. “It’s not an easy task, and it’s not
surprising to me it has taken some time because they are
difficult rules to write.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
