Klepierre SA (LI) , Europe’s second-largest publicly traded shopping mall operator, said third-quarter revenue rose as new tenants boosted rental income.  Revenue climbed about 1 percent to 267.8 million euros
($369 million), the Paris-based company said in a statement
today. The landlord, about 29 percent owned by  Simon Property
Group Inc. (SPG) , said rental income rose about 2.4 percent.  A total of 1,640 leases were signed during the first nine
months of the year, as the company focuses on bringing in more
attractive retailers, according to the statement.  “After four or five years of crisis, most retailers have
understood that they need to intensify their concept and their
offerings,” Chief Operating Officer Jean-Marc Jestin said on a
conference call. “We need to make sure it happens in a year or
two, and not five or six years.”  Klepierre last year said it planned to raise 1 billion
euros from asset sales by the end of this year by disposing of
offices to focus on malls. The real estate investment trust has
completed or reached agreements to sell 900 million euros of
assets since the plan was announced in July 2012, according to
today’s statement.  The results were released after the close of trading in
Paris. Klepierre has  climbed  8.6 percent this year. That
compares with an 11 percent increase by the Bloomberg EMEA REIT
Index.  The REIT held 13.2 billion euros of assets, mainly large
shopping centers in  Europe , at the end of June, according to
Klepierre’s web site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
