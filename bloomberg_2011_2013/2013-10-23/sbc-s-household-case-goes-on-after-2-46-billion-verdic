HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , already facing a
$2.46 billion judgment in an 11-year-old securities-fraud case,
must keep litigating claims as a U.S. judge ordered more
exchanges of evidence for a potential follow-up trial.  A federal jury in  Chicago  ruled in 2009 that executives at
Household International, now part of HSBC Finance Corp., misled
investors, violating U.S. securities laws. After a four-year
claims review process, U.S. District Judge Ronald Guzman last
week entered a $2.46 billion judgment on some claims.  Today, the judge ordered the parties to produce a schedule
for developing evidence, a process known as discovery, to
resolve about 200 more claims.  Guzman rejected a request by defense attorney Mark E. Rakoczy to delay the discovery process until a federal appeals
court rules on the bank’s challenge to the trial’s outcome.  “Eleven years is a long time,” the judge said. He also
predicted that the appellate court would issue its ruling before
the remaining claims were ready to be tried. “Let’s move
forward with discovery.”  Mike Dowd, a plaintiffs’ lawyer, today told Guzman there
remains a pool of 16,000 claims that are still in dispute. Dowd
said those claims are worth about $550 million, while he
acknowledged that this number is also being disputed.  A group of 6,500 claims, to which there are no objections,
will be paid, Dowd said, while about 9,500 more will be placed
on a rejected list because of the claimants’ failure to respond
to additional inquiries.  Household was acquired by London-based HSBC in March 2003
for $15.5 billion.  The case is Lawrence E. Jaffe Pension Plan v.  Household
International  Inc., 02-cv-05893, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
