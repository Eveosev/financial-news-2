Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil company,
is selling an 11.7 percent stake in  Snam SpA (SRG) , the owner of the
country’s biggest natural-gas network.  About 395 million  shares  are being offered at price range
of 3.69 euros to 3.77 euros, according to terms obtained by
Bloomberg News. At the top end of the price range, that values
the sale at as much as 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion).  The volume of secondary shares sales in Europe, including
accelerated book builds, has risen about 87 percent from the
same period last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Stakeholders including the French government and Warburg Pincus
LLC are paring holdings in the region.  Shares of Snam gained less than 1 percent to 3.85 euros at
the close today. They have risen more than 10 percent in the
past year.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are managing the
sale, according to a statement. Eni will hold an 8.54 percent
stake in Snam, underlying a 1.25 billion-euro convertible bond
placed on January 18 and due in 2016.  Issuers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa raised $36.7
billion in secondary share sales this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
