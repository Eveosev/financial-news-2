InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG) , the
world’s largest provider of hotel accommodation, said first-
quarter revenue per room rose as the company added properties
and charged more per room.  Revenue per available room, a measure of occupancy and
rates, increased by 3.1 percent from a year earlier, boosted by
a 2 percent gain in the average daily room rate, the Denham,
England-based company said in a statement today. Full-year
results will probably be in line with expectations, it said.  “Our high-quality pipeline, broad geographic spread and
fee-based model give us confidence for the year ahead, despite
the challenging economic conditions,” Chief Executive Officer
Richard Solomons said in the statement.  The owner of the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza brands is
benefiting from growing demand for accommodation in the
Americas, which account for about half of the company’s revenue.
Revpar in the region rose 4.1 percent, driven by a 4.6 percent
gain in the U.S.  Revpar fell 2.2 percent in  Europe , led by a 2.4 percent
drop in the U.K., as the timing of the Easter holiday hurt
occupancy, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
