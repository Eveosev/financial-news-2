Enel SpA (ENEL)  plans to sell 5 billion euros
($6.6 billion) of hybrid bonds “gradually” over a two-year
period as the company seeks to strengthen its finances.  “We will take account of market developments and act
accordingly each time,” Luigi Ferraris, chief financial officer
of Italy’s biggest energy company, said today in an interview.  The company has also identified some buyers for assets, he
said, declining to name them. Divestments may include minority
stakes and some generation assets, the finance chief said.  Enel’s board of directors yesterday authorized the sale of
as much as 5 billion euros of hybrid subordinated instruments by
Dec. 31, 2014. The Rome-based company said the bonds may be
placed with either institutional or retail investors. Enel, with
net debt of 43.3 billion euros, became  Europe ’s most indebted
energy company when it bought Spain’s  Endesa SA (ELE)  in 2007.  The Italian company said yesterday it’s on target to cut
debt to 37 billion euros next year. It plans 6 billion euros of
asset sales and 4 billion euros of cost cuts through 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
