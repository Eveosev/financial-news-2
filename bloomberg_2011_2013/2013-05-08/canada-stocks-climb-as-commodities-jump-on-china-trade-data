Canadian  stocks  rose for the fifth
straight day, reaching a one-month high, as commodities rallied
after reports showed  China ’s trade and Germany’s industrial
output beat estimates.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  and Teck Resources Ltd.
advanced more than 4.9 percent as industrial metals gained.
 Kinross Gold Corp. (K)  added 6.3 percent as earnings beat forecasts.
Iamgold Corp. and Barrick Gold Corp. climbed at least 8.6
percent after the precious metal rallied.  Tim Hortons (THI)  Inc.
slumped 2.6 percent after same-store sales fell in its
restaurants in  Canada  and the U.S.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 120.94
points, or 1 percent, to 12,585.05 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
highest since April 2. The benchmark equity gauge has added 2.1
percent since May 1 and is up 1.2 percent this year. Trading
volume was 5 percent above the 30-day average.  “A number of stocks are now factoring in a better economy;
it may be premature but that’s what’s happening,”  Irwin Michael ,  fund manager  with ABC Funds, said on the phone from
Toronto. His firm manages about C$800 million ($797 million).
“Commodities are acting better. China’s been growing about 7
percent. Europe is still pretty bleak and the only shining light
is Germany.”  China reported gains in both  imports  and exports, which may
ease concern that domestic demand is slowing after the world’s
second-largest economy unexpectedly  decelerated  last quarter.
China is Canada’s second biggest trade partner.  German industrial production unexpectedly rose for a second
month in March in a further sign that Europe’s largest economy
is returning to growth.  Materials Producers  Commodities producers  contributed  most to gains in the
S&P/TSX as six of 10 industries advanced. The S&P/TSX Materials
Index climbed 4.5 percent, the most in two weeks.  First Quantum gained 5.2 percent to C$18.71 and  Teck
Resources (TCK/B)  advanced 4.9 percent to C$29.34 as copper futures rose
to a three-week high. China accounts for more than 40 percent of
global copper consumption. Prices for aluminum, tin, zinc,
nickel and lead also advanced.  Kinross rose 6.3 percent to C$5.61 after reporting adjusted
earnings of 15 cents a share, ahead of analysts’ average
estimates of 13 cents according to a Bloomberg survey.
Production rose 10 percent from a year ago, while all-in costs
fell, the company said in a statement.  Gold Producers  Iamgold jumped 12 percent to C$6.03 after posting better-than-expected earnings. Barrick, the world’s largest gold miner,
rallied 8.6 percent to C$21.50.  Gold producers rallied 6.5 percent as a group to a three-week high as the metal’s price advanced 1.7 percent to settle at
$1,473.70 an ounce in New York. Gold imports to China from  Hong
Kong  more than doubled to a high in March, Hong Kong government
data showed yesterday.  Parkland Fuel Corp. (PKI) , Canada’s largest independent fuel
distributor, climbed 7.2 percent to C$17.48, the biggest gain in
18 months. First-quarter net income rose to 42 Canadian cents a
share from 26 cents a year earlier. Sales jumped 14 percent.
Trevor Johnson, an analyst with National Bank Financial,
upgraded the stock to the equivalent of a buy from hold.  Tim Hortons , Canada’s largest coffee and doughnuts chain,
slumped 2.6 percent to C$57.13. Sales at Canadian stores open
for more than a year declined 0.3 percent in the first quarter
compared with a year ago. The Oakville, Ontario-based company
blamed the economy and weather for the drop.  The company also announced it has hired Marc Caira, a
senior Nestle SA executive, as its new president and chief
executive officer effective July 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
