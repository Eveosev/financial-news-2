  Plug Power Inc. (PLUG) , a U.S. maker of fuel
cells, rose the most in more than four years after receiving a
$6.5 million investment from  Air Liquide SA (AI)  to help develop
components for the European market.  The shares climbed 54 percent to 24 cents at the close in
New York, the most since October 2008.  Air Liquide, the French maker of industrial gases, will get
stock, a larger stake in a joint venture and a contract for
engineering services, according to a statement today from
Latham, New York-based Plug.  Plug has raised $12 million in 2013 and this latest
investment “will be instrumental in providing the liquidity we
need for growth,” Chief Executive Officer Andy Marsh said in
the statement. The company makes fuel cells that power
industrial forklifts.  Last month, the company replaced its chief financial
officer and was notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market that its
shares don’t meet the minimum price of $1 and may be delisted.
Plug has until Oct. 7 to regain compliance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
