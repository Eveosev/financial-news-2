Canadian  housing starts  declined for
the first time in three months in April led by multiple-unit
projects, the federal housing agency said today.  Work began on about 174,900 homes at a seasonally adjusted
annual pace in April, down 3.5 percent from March, Ottawa-based
Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said. Economists forecast a
reading of 175,000 according to the median of 25 responses to a
Bloomberg News survey.  Today’s figure is 31 percent below the year-ago pace.
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has said he welcomes the slowdown
of condominium construction in Toronto and  Vancouver  after signs
of overbuilding there, and has warned consumers with record debt
loads relative to income not to become overextended.  “Homebuilding is tracking below the pace of underlying
household formation, roughly 185,000, and is likely to do so for
some time after overshooting in 2012,” Emanuella Enenajor, an
economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto,
wrote in a note to clients. “We expect residential construction
to exert a drag on overall growth this year.”  Multiple-unit housing  starts  in urban areas fell 3.5
percent in April to a pace of 93,500, a decline of 42 percent
from the same month a year earlier, according to the CMHC
report. Single-unit work fell 0.9 percent to 60,100 units, down
16 percent from the year-ago month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
