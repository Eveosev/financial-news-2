Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  said it’s
cooperating with Indian authorities after a newspaper reported
the German company is being investigated for possibly owing $120
million in taxes.  “An inspection is in process by the authorities at the BMW
plant in Chennai,” Abhay Dange, a BMW India spokesman, said in
a text message. “We are cooperating with the authorities in the
inspection process.”  Indian authorities are examining whether BMW owes
additional taxes for auto-parts imports stretching back to 2011,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with
the matter it didn’t identify. Inspectors have seized a shipment
of engines and transmission equipment as part of the probe,
according to the report.  Dange declined to comment on details of the investigation.  Sandeep Bhatnagar, joint secretary for customs at  India ’s
Central Board of Customs and Excise in  New Delhi , didn’t answer
after-hours calls to his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
