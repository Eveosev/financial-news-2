CAL Bank Ltd., a Ghanaian lender whose
shares have surged 92 percent this year, will increase deposits
as much as 35 percent in 2013 amid plans to expand its network
of branches in West Africa’s second-biggest economy.  The Accra-based bank wants to lower the share of money in
term deposits, where  interest rates  are higher than accounts
with flexible withdrawals, Managing Director Frank Adu Jr. told
brokers and reporters at the  Ghana  Stock Exchange today.  “We are focusing on product-driven retail deposits
mobilization in 2013,” he said.  CAL’s push to retail clients is a move from its focus on
corporate lending since the bank began in 1990. By the end of
the first quarter of this year, 49 percent of client savings
were in term deposits held by companies. Interest on the
accounts can be higher than government Treasury bills, Adu Jr.
said. The benchmark  91-day T-bill rate  was 22.8 percent at the
latest auction on May 5.  In three years, CAL Bank targets term deposits at 35
percent of savings, General Manager Joseph Ofori-Teiko said. On
savings deposits, the bank pays not more than 5 percent
interest, said Philip Fynn, head of treasury.  Net income almost tripled to 21.3 million cedis ($11
million) in the first quarter from a year earlier. Net interest
income, the money banks make on loans less the ones they pay on
deposits advanced to 32.4 million cedis from 12.8 million cedis.  CAL Bank will open four branches this year to bring its
network to 23, Adu Jr. said. By the end of 2015, it will have 30
locations and 100 automated teller machines, double the current
number, he said.  Ghana’s gross domestic product may rise to 100 billion
cedis in three years from 67 billion cedis currently as the West
African nation develops more  oil fields , Adu Jr. said. CAL Bank
“will target the growing middle class clientele who have the
appetite for asset-backed consumption,” he said.  The bank’s shares were unchanged at 73 pesewas by the close
in Accra. The GSE’s Composite  Index (GGSECI)  has advanced 52 percent this
year, the world’s best performing equities gauge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
