Brazil ’s swap rates fell to a 12-week
low as annual inflation slowed, encouraging speculation that the
central bank will limit increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 declined two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.17 percent at 9:56
a.m. in Sao Paulo, the lowest level on a closing basis since
Feb. 14. The real rose 0.1 percent to 2.0050 per dollar.  Annual inflation slowed to 6.49 percent in April from 6.59
percent in the prior month, the national statistics agency
reported today. The central bank has a target range of 2.5
percent to 6.5 percent.  “Slower inflation is causing traders to bet that the
central bank won’t accelerate rate hikes or that the tightening
cycle will be smaller,” Daniel Cunha, an economist at XP
Investimentos, said in a phone interview from  Rio de Janeiro .  The central bank board voted 6 to 2 last month to increase
the target lending rate to 7.50 percent from a record low 7.25
percent, saying in its statement that the “resilience of
inflation” required action.  To contact the reporters on this story:
