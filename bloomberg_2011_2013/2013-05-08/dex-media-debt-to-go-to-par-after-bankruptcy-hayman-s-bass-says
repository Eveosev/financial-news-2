Dex Media Inc. (DXM) ’s bonds will more than
double in value to trade at par and its shares will jump to as
much as 10 times current levels, according to Kyle Bass, whose
Dallas-based hedge-fund firm Hayman Advisors LP made $500
million in 2007 betting against U.S. subprime mortgages.  Dex Media is a small company and a “cheap option,” Bass
said today at the Ira Sohn conference in  New York . Hayman owns
9.9 percent of the equity, he said.  Shares of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, Texas-based
company  surged  17.9 percent to $16.17 as of 1:41 p.m. in New
York after his comments, pushing its  market capitalization  to
$275.6 million. The company’s $219.7 million of 14 percent
subordinated bonds due in January 2017 last traded March 12 at
44 cents on the dollar to yield 41.8 percent, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Dex Media is the combined entity of phone-book publishers
Dex One Corp. and SuperMedia Inc., set to merge through
implementation of their companion bankruptcy reorganizations
approved April 29. Lenders will be paid in full with new debt,
unsecured creditors will be fully paid so long as they continue
providing credit and shareholders of the two companies will
share ownership of the merged business.  Hayman held 5.9 percent of the equity at the end of last
year, the second-largest share of firms that report their
holdings, according to  data  compiled Bloomberg.  Franklin
Resources Inc. (BEN)  held 31.6 percent as of April 12.  Dex Media will have as much as $175 million in projected
annual cost savings and will be able to use $1 billion in net
operating losses to offset future income taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
