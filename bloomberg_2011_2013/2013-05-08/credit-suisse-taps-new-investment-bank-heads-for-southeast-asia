Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  appointed Rizal
Gozali and Edwin Low to co-head its Southeast Asia  investment
banking  team from Jakarta and  Singapore , respectively.  Gozali and Low will be responsible for the coverage of
Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and the
Philippines, Switzerlandâ€™s second-largest bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Credit Suisse is reinforcing its efforts in the region
where it ranks 17th so far this year in merger and acquisition
advisory, compared with a 7th place finish last year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank is currently advising
DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in its pending $6.8 billion bid for PT
Bank Danamon Indonesia.  The bank also named Robby Winarta, a managing director
based in Jakarta, to lead investment banking in Indonesia. He
will report to Gozali and Low, Credit Suisse said.  Prior to the appointments, effective immediately, Low
headed investment banking in Malaysia and Singapore for Credit
Suisse, and Gozali led the team in Indonesia.  Credit Suisse so far this year ranks 10th in underwriting
equity and debt issuances in  Southeast Asia , the same as last
year, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
