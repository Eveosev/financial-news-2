Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the wind-turbine maker that’s lost money the past two years, rose to a
13-month high in Copenhagen trading after first-quarter results
showed its turnaround program is on schedule.  Vestas jumped as much as 14 percent to 60.35 kroner, the
highest intraday price since March 27, 2012, and was at 60.25
kroner as of 12:28 p.m. local time. Trading volumes were already
twice the three-month daily average.  The company’s net loss shrank to 151 million euros ($198
million) from 162 million euros a year earlier, it said. Profit
margins, based on earnings before interest, tax and special
items, improved to minus 9.9 percent from minus 18.5 percent.  “We are trending pretty well according to the plan that we
have laid out,” Chief Executive Officer  Ditlev Engel  said by
phone. “We made a lot of progress on  cash flow  in particular.”  The company is 14 months into a two-year program to return
to profit following two years of losses caused by stronger
competition that depressed prices in the industry. The stock has
risen 90 percent this year and in the past two weeks had its
biggest winning streak since the 1998 initial public offering.  Free cash flow rose by 235 million euros to a deficit of 60
million euros in the quarter, according to Aarhus, Denmark-based
Vestas. Revenue was little changed at 1.1 billion euros.  “The turnaround seems to be going according to plan,”
 Jacob Pedersen , an analyst at  Sydbank A/S (SYDB)  in Aabenraa,  Denmark ,
said by phone before the results were released.  Lower Shipments  Quarterly shipments declined by more than a third to 613
megawatts, Vestas said, citing a slower U.S. market. Orders
totaled 644 megawatts, about half the 1,269 megawatts reported a
year earlier.  U.S. demand has weakened following a rush in turbine
installations last year, driven by the December expiry of a tax
credit. Vestas expects North American orders to recover
following clarification last month of new U.S. regulations
related to the tax break, which wasn’t renewed until Jan. 1.  “We are hopeful we will see new positive momentum for
getting orders placed, especially now we have the language
confirmed,” Engel said. That “makes it look like things will
start to move in the second half of 2013.”  Vestas kept guidance for 2013 shipments of 4,000 megawatts
to 5,000 megawatts, down from 6,200 megawatts in 2012. It said
revenue may fall to 5.5 billion euros from 7.2 billion euros.  Vestas Bonds  The company’s cash boost was also reflected in its bonds as
investors required a lower return. The yield on Vestas’s 600
million-euro 4.625 percent bond fell to as low as 8.14 percent
and was heading for its lowest close since November 2011.  The company is seeking to regain its leading position in
the wind-turbine market, having lost the top spot in 2012 after
12 years, according to  Navigant Consulting Inc. (NCI) ’s BTM Consult
unit, which gave  General Electric Co. (GE)  the lead. Make Consulting
said the Danish company still ranked first, while Bloomberg New
Energy Finance had Vestas and GE in a statistical tie.  Vestas expects to exceed its target for fixed cost savings
of 400 million euros a year in 2013, according to today’s
statement. It plans to cut its workforce by about 30 percent to
16,000 by year-end from 22,721 in 2011. A total of 582 jobs were
lost in the first quarter, the company said today.  Former Chief Financial Officer Dag Gunnar Andresen, who
left the post at the end of last month, had helped drive the
turnaround. As well as overseeing cost cuts since August, he
assisted in renegotiating debts with lenders. In November,
Vestas persuaded a group of nine banks to provide a new 900
million-euro  credit line , replacing a 1.3 million-euro facility.  Andresen has been replaced by Marika Fredriksson, a former
employee of Gambro AB and Volvo Construction Equipment Corp.  Engel today declined to comment on the progress of talks
with  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)  to collaborate on the
development of the 8-megawatt V164 offshore wind turbine. The
discussions were announced in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
