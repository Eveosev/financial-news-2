Two cases of Chateau Angelus 2008, a
Saint-Emilion wine estate promoted to the region’s top status of
Premier Grand Cru Classe A last year, sold for a two-month low
of 1,600 pounds ($2,500) each on  London ’s Liv-ex yesterday.  The price was 11 percent down from the peak of 1,800 pounds
a case touched on Liv-ex in both February and April, and above
the 1,550 pounds at which it traded on Feb. 27, Liv-ex data
showed. The 2008 wine is cheaper than Angelus’s two subsequent
vintages in merchant listings, but more expensive than its
2011s, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  Chateau Angelus was promoted along with Chateau Pavie last
year, joining Chateau Ausone and Chateau Cheval Blanc in Saint-
Emilion’s top tier of wine producers. The new rankings replaced
a classification in force since 1996.  Angelus and Pavie both priced their 2012 wines last month
at 180 euros a bottle ex-Bordeaux in the futures market, or
2,160 euros ($2,850) a case, according to data compiled by the
London-based Liv-ex market. The price represented a 30 percent
increase by Angelus and a 58% jump by Pavie from their 2011
prices, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
