The New York Islanders scored three
unanswered third-period goals for their first home playoff
victory since 2002, a 6-4 win that tied up their National Hockey
League series against the Pittsburgh Penguins at 2-2.  After Pascal Dupuis had given the visiting Penguins a 4-3
lead in the opening minute of the third period, Mark Streit,
John Tavares and Casey Cizikas had goals for the Islanders.  Game 5 in the best-of-seven first-round series is set for
May 9 in Pittsburgh.  The Islanders had lost seven straight postseason games at
the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, tying an NHL record.  Also tonight, the Montreal Canadiens are trying to even
their series against the host Ottawa Senators at two games
apiece; the Minnesota Wild are at home as they try to tie up
their series 2-2 against the Chicago Blackhawks, and the San
Jose Sharks try to complete a four-game sweep of the visiting
Vancouver Canucks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
