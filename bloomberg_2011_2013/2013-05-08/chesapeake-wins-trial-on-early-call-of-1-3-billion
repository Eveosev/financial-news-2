     May 8 (Bloomberg) -- Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  won a bid to 
save $100 million in interest payments by carrying out an early
call of $1.3 billion in bonds at par after a judge ruled against
the notesâ€™ trustee, Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp.  Chesapeake, the second-biggest producer of natural gas in
the U.S., met a March 15 deadline in the indenture contract to
redeem the notes early at 100 cents on the dollar, U.S. District
Judge Paul Engelmayer ruled today in Manhattan.  Chesapeake sued BNY Mellon in March after the bank
challenged its bid to redeem the 6.775 percent notes six years
early and refinance the debt -- a plan that will save the
company about $100 million because of lower interest rates. The
gas producer notified investors of the early call on March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
