Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the wind
turbine maker with the most installed capacity, posted a wider
first quarter loss than forecast and said its turnaround
“continues according to plan” as it boosted its first-quarter
operating margin.  The manufacturer’s net loss shrank to 151 million euros
from 162 million euros a year earlier, according to a statment
to the Copenhagen Stock Exchange today. That compares with the
average forecast of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a
net loss of 84 million euros. The ebit margin was minus 9.9
percent, an improvement from last year’s minus 18.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
