The number of derivatives traded on
exchanges rose in the first quarter as continuing political and
economic risks drove traders into the market, according to data
provided by the members of the World Federation of Exchanges.  Trading of exchange-traded derivatives globally increased
1.4 percent to 4.95 billion in the first quarter of 2013 from
4.88 billion in the comparable period last year, Romain Devai,
WFE’s research and projects manager, said in an interview at
 IOMA , the World Federation of Exchanges’ derivatives conference,
in Busan,  South Korea .  Excluding trading in the benchmark  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  options,
which fell after the size of the contracts was multiplied by
five, trading rose 13.6 percent to 4.80 billion in the quarter
from 4.22 billion in the first quarter of 2012.  “Uncertainty continues, which means there’s a greater need
for hedging,” Devai said in an interview. “Also we have begun
to see a return in volumes on the underlying cash markets which
usually aids derivatives volumes.”  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  said last week that net revenue from
derivatives increased 14 percent to $201 million in the quarter
as volume rose. Equity-trading revenue, excluding regulatory
fees and liquidity payments, fell 5.6 percent to $287 million,
NYSE said.  Deutsche Boerse , based in  Frankfurt , said that profit
fell 26 percent as trading volume declined.  The number of derivatives traded on exchanges worldwide
fell last year for the first time since 2004, according to the
data. About 21 billion contracts changed hands on exchanges last
year, down from 25 billion in 2011. Commodity derivatives were
the only asset class that grew, the industry group said.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
