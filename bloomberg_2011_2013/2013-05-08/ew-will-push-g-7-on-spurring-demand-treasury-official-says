U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
will push his Group of Seven counterparts to focus on spurring
domestic demand, a Treasury official told reporters in
 Washington  today.  The official, who declined to be identified as a condition
for holding the briefing, said strengthening European demand is
the most important issue in reviving global growth. Gross
domestic product in the 17-nation euro area will fall 0.4
percent this year, compared with a February prediction of a 0.3
percent decline, the European Commission said May 3.  Lew will take his message for reinvigorating growth to a
meeting of G-7 finance ministers May 10-11 in Buckinghamshire,
England. Since taking office in February, Lew has traveled to
China,  Belgium , Germany and  France  for talks with his
counterparts and led the U.S. at a Group of 20 meeting in
Washington last month.  During a trip to  Cleveland  yesterday, Lew said  Europe  has
“responded to the argument that you need to balance growth and
austerity. They’ve given more time to countries like Portugal
and Ireland and France to meet fiscal targets.”  The Treasury official today said the G-7 will review demand
and growth in Japan. The country’s monetary policy is aimed at
reaching 2 percent inflation in two years, while the yen has
fallen 12 percent against the dollar in 2013, the most of the
greenback’s 31 most-traded peers.  Global finance officials have agreed not to target their
exchange rates for competitive purposes and have given room to
Japan to stimulate its economy as long as it doesn’t publicly
advocate a falling yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
