Ferro Corp. (FOE) , a U.S. chemical company
that rejected an unsolicited takeover offer, agreed to concede
two board seats to dissident director nominees who have
criticized the company’s performance.  Ferro will nominate Quinpario Partners LLC Chief Executive
Officer Jeffry Quinn and FrontFour Capital Group LLC Cofounder
David Lorber to the board of the Mayfield Heights, Ohio-based
company, Ferro and FrontFour said today in a joint statement.
FrontFour and Quinpario agreed to withdraw their slate of three
nominees, which included Quinn and Lorber, from the May 15
election and abide by “standstill” restrictions.  Ferro also agreed to form a five-member committee that will
include Quinn and Lorber to evaluate strategies for enhancing
 shareholder value , including reviewing strategic proposals, the
company’s mix of businesses and  capital structure .  “We look forward to working together constructively with
the board and management team to help drive value for Ferro
shareholders,” Quinn said in the statement.  Quinpario and FrontFour, which have said they hold 4.3
percent of Ferro shares, have said Ferro underperforms peer
companies and should give greater consideration to A. Schulman
Inc.’s March 4 buyout  offer  of $6.50 a share. Schulman on April
22 reiterated that it may raise its buyout offer if it can look
at Ferro’s books.  To contact the reporter on this story:
