Bakken crude on the spot market
strengthened for the first time in more than a week after
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  sent a notice to shippers yesterday saying it
stopped accepting receipts of oil on its North Dakota system,
disrupting deliveries to the pricing point in  Minnesota .  Enbridge will resume taking receipts later today, Larry Springer, a Houston-based spokesman for the company, said in a
phone interview. Storage tanks at receipt points reached
capacity after the company shut Line 81, the main line on the
North Dakota system, at 10:50 a.m. after workers found
contaminated soil along it.  The company restarted the line at 11 p.m., and should begin
accepting receipts and running the North Dakota system normally
again today, Springer said. Line 81 can carry as much as 210,000
barrels a day from North Dakota to Clearbrook, Minnesota, the
pricing point for Bakken oil.  The price at Clearbrook gained 75 cents to a  discount  of $5
a barrel to West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at
3:51 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s the first time the discount has narrowed since
April 30.  Meanwhile, Light Louisiana Sweet crude sank to a 15-month
low versus WTI as the gap between European and U.S. grades
narrowed to the closest point since January 2011.  Brent’s  premium  to WTI fell 95 cents to $7.83 a barrel, the
first time it’s been below $8 since Jan. 21, 2011. Gulf crudes
compete with foreign oils priced against Brent for space in U.S.
refineries.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s  premium  fell $1.35 to $9.10 a
barrel, the lowest since Jan. 19, 2012. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
fell $1.20 to a $9.15-a-barrel premium to WTI.  Mars Blend’s  premium  fell $1.30 to $5 a barrel. Poseidon
weakened $1.40 to $4.90 a barrel more than WTI. Southern Green
slipped $1.15 to a $4.05 premium and Thunder Horse dropped $1.25
to $7.75 a barrel over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
