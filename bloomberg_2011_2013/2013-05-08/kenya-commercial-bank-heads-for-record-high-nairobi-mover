Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., the
country’s biggest lender by market value and assets, headed for
a record high on speculation it will follow competitors in
reporting increased first-quarter earnings today.  KCB, as the lender is known,  climbed 2.4 percent  to 43.25
shillings by 1:56 p.m. in Nairobi, the highest on a closing
basis since at least May 1997 when Bloomberg began compiling the
data. More than 1.6 million shares were traded, 57 percent of
the three-month daily average volume.  The company is scheduled to announce earnings after the
market close. Equity Bank Ltd., the nation’s biggest lender by
customers, said on May 6 first-quarter profit soared 22 percent
to 3.2 billion shillings ($38 million) while NIC Bank Ltd.,
which has operations in Uganda and Tanzania, said April 30 net
income rose 20 percent in the period.  “Guys are taking indications from NIC and Equity’s
profits” Rufus Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based Canaan
Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview. “For KCB I expect 20
percent to 25 percent in terms of growth in net profitability.”  KCB’s stock has advanced 45 percent this year, compared
with a gain of 29 percent for the benchmark Nairobi Securities
Exchange All Share Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
