EON SE (EOAN) ,  Germany ’s biggest utility,
said its proprietary energy trading posted a profit in the first
quarter after a loss in the same period last year.  The utility’s profit from trading energy for its own
account was 7 million euros ($9.18 million) on an earnings
before interest and tax basis in the three months through March,
according to the Dusseldorf, Germany-based company’s  report 
published today. That compares with a loss of 4 million euros in
the same period last year, the utility said.  EON posted a profit for its so-called optimization business
of 178 million euros after a loss of 79 million euros a year
earlier, the company said, citing an improved performance of its
gas midstream business and a gain from carbon trading.  The company bought and sold less electricity, it said,
without giving details. EON traded 437 terawatt-hours in the
first quarter of last year.  EON buys and sells electricity, natural gas, oil, coal,
carbon emissions and biomass through its global commodities
unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
