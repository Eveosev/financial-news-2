Banks in the European Union will be
forced to reduce the paperwork for customers who want to switch
to another lender, and to give clear information on account
fees, as part of a package of measures to bolster competition.  The European Commission  said  it’s resorting to legislation
after lenders failed to respond convincingly to calls from
regulators to aid account switching. The plans will also require
governments to ensure that all EU citizens can access a
basic bank account.  “By making it easier to compare fees and change bank
accounts, we also hope to see better offers from banks and lower
costs,”  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services chief, said
in an e-mailed statement. It will encourage banks to “offer
products cross-border and enter new markets,” he said.  Bank-account switching levels in the EU are low compared
with equivalent figures for swapping telecom and internet
providers, according to EU data.  About 10 percent of bank customers moved to a new lender in
2011, the most recent year for which figures are available. A
European Commission survey of bank websites, published last
year, found that 32 percent of the tested sample had no
information on account switching.  To contact the reporter on this story:
