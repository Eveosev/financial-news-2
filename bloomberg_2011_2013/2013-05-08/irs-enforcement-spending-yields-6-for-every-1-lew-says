Every dollar spent enforcing U.S. tax
laws yields $6 in collections, said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew as he urged Congress to support the  Internal Revenue
Service ’s request for a $1 billion budget increase.  The IRS is seeking $12.9 billion for fiscal year 2014, a 9
percent increase from this year.  Lew criticized the across-the-board spending cuts that
started in March, saying they are causing the IRS to plan at
least five days when it will furlough employees and close its
offices to the public.  “This will erode our ability to provide quality service,”
Lew told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee in  Washington .
“The sequester is not only hurting Treasury’s employees. It’s
hurting taxpayers as well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
