The Ibovespa retreated from its
strongest level since March amid speculation the gains that
pushed valuations on the Brazilian stock benchmark to a four-month high may have been excessive.  Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) , the bank led by the billionaire  Andre Esteves , fell after its first-quarter earnings trailed analysts’
estimates. The MSCI  Brazil /Energy Index slid the most among 10
industry groups as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled
oil producer also known as Petrobras, dropped from its highest
price since December. OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA sank
the most on the benchmark after erasing a 9.7 percent gain.  The Ibovespa declined 0.8 percent to 55,804.80 at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo. Thirty-eight stocks fell on the gauge
while 31 advanced. The index  traded  yesterday at 12.5 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.9 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The real climbed 0.1 percent to 2.0054 per dollar today.  “Stocks linked to domestic consumption, which in theory
have the best outlook, aren’t cheap,” Wagner Salaverry, a
partner at Quantitas Asset Management, which oversees 12 billion
reais of assets, said by phone from  Porto Alegre , Brazil.
“Bigger companies such as Petrobras trade at lower valuations
for a reason. There are real concerns about them.”  Petrobras fell 1.6 percent to 20.29 reais. BTG dropped 1.1
percent to 33.60 reais. OGX, the  oil company  controlled by
Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista ,  sank  9.7 percent to 1.76
reais.  Bradesco Gains  Voting shares of lender Banco Bradesco SA added 1.5 percent
to 34.75 reais, the most on the MSCI Brazil/Financials Index,
which advanced for a second day.  The Ibovespa earlier gained as much as 1 percent as some
commodities producers rallied after a report showing that  China 
imported more goods than estimated last month, boosting the
outlook for the Brazil’s top trading partner.  Vale SA, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, rose for a
fourth day, gaining 0.2 percent to 33.12 reais, the highest
since April 9. Competitor MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA advanced
3 percent to 2.05 reais.  The Ibovespa has retreated 8.4 percent this year, the worst
performer after Colombia’s IGBC index among 19 major emerging
markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The MSCI BRIC
Index of shares in Brazil,  Russia ,  India  and China has lost 0.2
percent over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
