Rubber advanced to the highest level
in more than three weeks as  Japan ’s currency weakened, raising
the appeal of the yen-based futures, and amid speculation  China 
may increase imports of the commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in October gained as much as 1.4
percent to 274.60 yen a kilogram ($2,772 a metric ton), the
highest since April 15 and traded at 273.4 yen at at 11:23 a.m
on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures rallied 6.8 percent
yesterday, the biggest gain since Nov. 14, 2011.  The yen weakened to 99.12 per dollar, nearing to a four-
year low of 99.95 reached on April 11. China may increase
imports of the raw material to take advantage of low
international prices, said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at
research company JSC Corp. in  Tokyo . Natural rubber imports by
China were 230,000 metric tons in April, the customs agency said
today, compared with 234,044 tons in March and 167,618 tons a
year ago.  “China may step up rubber purchases on hopes for demand
recovery later this year,” he said today by phone.  Rubber inventory in Qingdao, China’s main hub for the
commodity, rose to a record last month, as imports gained while
demand remained tepid amid slowing economic growth. Stockpiles
in the bonded zone, where traders store deliveries before paying
duties, climbed to 371,100 metric tons at the end of April from
366,900 tons on April 15, according to Cai Zhiwei, general
manager at the Qingdao International Rubber Exchange Market.  Rubber for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 1.1 percent to 20,050  yuan  ($3,264) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board jumped 3.5 percent to 88.85 baht ($3) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
