Hog futures rose for the first time in
a week on signs of shrinking supplies of U.S. pork amid rising
demand. Cattle prices fell.  About 399,000 hogs were processed in the  Iowa  and southern
Minnesota area in the week ended May 4, down 2 percent from a
week earlier, government data show. Wholesale  pork , a gauge of
demand, rose 1 percent to 87.92 cents a pound yesterday, the
highest since April 29, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  “Packers have trimmed slaughter a bit, but because the
supplies are tight, there’s still competition for hogs,” Doug Houghton, a commodity analyst at Brock Associates in  Milwaukee ,
said in a telephone interview. “Demand right now is seasonally
strong.”  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.6 percent to 91.85
cents a pound at 10:05 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
A close at that level would be the first increase since May 1
and the largest for a most-active contract since April 26.  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.4 percent to $1.203
a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement dropped 0.8
percent to $1.45325 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
