Crude options volatility fell to the
lowest level since April 11 as the underlying futures jumped to
a one-month high.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 19.63 percent at 4:35 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 21.79 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery jumped $1
to settle at $96.62 a barrel a barrel on the Nymex.  “Higher prices tend to bring out lower volatility,” said
Jim Colburn, a vice president and energy options broker at
Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York .  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
