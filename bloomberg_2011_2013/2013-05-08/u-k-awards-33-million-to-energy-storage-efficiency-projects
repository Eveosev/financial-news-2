The U.K. awarded 21 million pounds
($33 million) split between dozens of companies to fund further
development of new energy efficiency and heat and power storage
technologies.  Thirty projects will split 16 million pounds aimed at
improving the energy efficiency of buildings, lighting, heating
and cooling, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said
today in an e-mailed statement. Sixteen organizations will split
2 million pounds to develop energy storage systems, and nine
developers will share 3 million pounds to test prototype
household heat storage devices, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
