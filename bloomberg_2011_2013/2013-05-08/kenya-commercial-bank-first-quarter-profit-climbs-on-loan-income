Kenya  Commercial Bank Ltd., the
country’s biggest lender by market value and assets, said first-quarter profit climbed 25 percent as income from loans increased
and costs were little changed.  Net income in the three months through March rose to 3.03
billion shillings ($36 million) from 2.43 billion shillings a
year earlier, the Nairobi-based lender said in an e-mailed
statement. Net interest income, the money banks earn from
interest charges on loans, grew 5.7 percent to 7.37 billion
shillings, while expenses rose 3 percent to 6.6 billion
shillings, it said.  Kenya, East Africa’s biggest economy, is increasing
spending on infrastructure including power plants, roads and
ports under a program that seeks to achieve average annual
economic growth of 10 percent over the next two decades. The
country seeks to reach middle-income status by 2030.  “We are optimistic on our medium- to long-term growth
prospects,” Chief Executive Officer Joshua Oigara said in the
statement. “Our large balance sheet enables the bank to lend to
the growing large infrastructure developments in the country,
real estate, manufacturing” and other projects, he said.  The Finance Ministry is targeting economic growth of 5.6
percent this year, compared with 5 percent in 2012.  KCB’s stock  gained  1.8 percent to 43 shillings at the close
of trade today and before the results were released. The shares
have advanced 45 percent this year, outperforming a 29 percent
gain in the Nairobi Securities Exchange All Share Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
