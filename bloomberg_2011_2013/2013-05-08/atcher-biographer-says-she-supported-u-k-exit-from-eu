Margaret Thatcher  concluded in about
1992 that the U.K. should leave the European Union, her
biographer said, explaining that aides persuaded her not to
announce her change of view publicly.  “I think it happened after the Maastricht Treaty in
1992,” Charles Moore wrote in the  Spectator magazine .
“Advisers had persuaded her that she should not say this in
public since it would have allowed her opponents to drive her to
the fringes of public life.”  Moore, who had full access to Thatcher’s archive as well as
her support in writing her authorized biography, published the
first volume, going up to 1982, last month, shortly after her
death. He said in his Spectator article that he thought her
views on the EU were widely known.  The news came the day after  Nigel Lawson , Thatcher’s former
chancellor of the exchequer, became the most senior Conservative
to say that he plans to vote for Britain to leave the EU if
there is a referendum.  Thatcher stepped down as prime minister in 1990. Her
successor,  John Major , signed the Maastricht Treaty, laying the
foundations of today’s EU, in 1992.  Moore also said Thatcher wouldn’t have joined the anti-EU
U.K. Independence Party. “She would never have joined a party
which could not win a general election.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
