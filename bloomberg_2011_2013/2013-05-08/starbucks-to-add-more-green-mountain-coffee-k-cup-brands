Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest
coffee-shop operator, announced it will add brands, including
Seattle’s Best Coffee, to its K-Cup lineup with a five-year
agreement with  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)   The deal shows that while Starbucks last year introduced a
single-serve machine called Verismo, it will continue to support
 Green Mountain ’s Keurig brewer. Starbucks also will start
selling cocoa and Teavana tea K-cups, the Seattle-based company
said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  is attempting to
boost sales beyond the company’s coffee shops with its grocery
business and with the recent acquisitions of Teavana Holdings
Inc. and Bay Bread LLC. Revenue at the coffee brewer is
projected to rise 12 percent to $14.9 billion in its fiscal
2013, compared with an 14 percent increase the year before.  Starbucks first reached an agreement with Green Mountain in
March 2011 to sell Starbucks brand K-Cups. Sales of the coffee
pods surged 75 percent in March compared with the previous year,
the company said.  Starbucks rose 0.4 percent to $62.41 at the close in New
York. The  shares  have gained 16 percent this year, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has climbed 14 percent.  Starbucks has more than 18,800 stores worldwide, including
about 11,100 in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
