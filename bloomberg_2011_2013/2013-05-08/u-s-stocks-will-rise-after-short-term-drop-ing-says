The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will
continue its advance and may trigger a longer-term buy signal
for global equity markets, even as the benchmark gauge for U.S.
stocks nears a resistance level, according to a technical
analyst at ING Groep NV.  The measure is nearing its short-term resistance of 1,635,
signalling a possible 1.6 percent decline from yesterday’s
finish to 1,600 within the next two weeks. Still, a monthly
close above the longer-term resistance level of 1,600 would send
a buy signal for the next year, triggering a greater increase in
the  S&P 500  that will lead global stock markets higher, Roelof-Jan van den Akker said.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  climbed yesterday to its fourth straight record
close. The measure topped 1,600 for the first time on May 3.
U.S. stocks are in the fifth year of a  bull market  amid better-than estimated corporate earnings and three rounds of bond
purchases by the  Federal Reserve .  “Prices are slowly breaking the upward rising resistance
line around 1,600,” van den Akker said in a telephone interview
from Amsterdam. “Even though we may see a short-term pullback
that we will consider normal, the S&P 500’s uptrend is intact
and likely to continue. Prices are still in a steep upward move
in the next few weeks.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
