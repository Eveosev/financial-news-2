Gold futures posted the biggest gain
in almost two weeks as demand for bars and jewelry increased in
 India  and  China , the world’s largest consumers of the metal.  Imports by China from Hong Kong more than doubled to an
all-time high in March, Hong Kong government data showed
yesterday. India’s purchases are set to top 100 metric tons in
May for the second straight month, according to MMTC-PAMP India
Pvt., a bullion refiner. Last month, gold had the biggest two-day drop in 33 years, slumping into a bear market. The metal has
climbed 12 percent from a 26-month low on April 16.  “The jump in prices was mainly on reports of strong
physical buying from India and China,” Michael Smith, the
president of T&K Futures & Options Inc. in Port St. Lucie,
 Florida , said in a telephone interview. “Imports by China in
April may have been even higher than in March.”  Gold futures for June delivery advanced 1.7 percent to
settle at $1,473.70 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since April
25. On April 16, the price touched $1,321.50, the lowest since
Jan. 28, 2011.  Buyers in mainland China purchased 223,519 kilograms
(223.52 tons) of gold in March, including scrap, compared with
97,106 kilograms in February, Hong Kong government data showed.
Separate figures yesterday showed China’s gold usage rose 26
percent in the first quarter as prices fell.  SPDR Fund  Yesterday, holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded product backed by the metal, declined 0.4
percent to 1,057.79 tons, the lowest since March 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold has dropped 12 percent this year as equities rallied
and some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value.
Yesterday, the  Standard & Poor’s (SPX)  500 Index closed at a record
for the fourth straight session, while the Dow Jones Industrial
Average settled above 15,000 for the first time.  “We strongly believe that gold prices will fall under
heavy pressure again on a further liquidation of gold-investment
demand,” Georgette Boele, a commodities strategist at ABN Amro
Group NV, said in a report.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$23.927 an ounce on the Comex. The price has dropped 21 percent
this year.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
July delivery gained 1.6 percent to $1,504.90 an ounce.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose 2.6 percent to
$698.25 an ounce, the biggest jump since March 20.  To contact the reporters for this story:
