Paul Singer, who runs $21.8 billion
Elliott Management Corp. in New York, said long-term bonds in
the U.S.,  Japan  and  Europe  are trading at the “wrong price.”  “There is no safe haven in these markets,” Singer said at
the 18th Sohn Investment Conference in New York today. There is
a buildup of risk in the U.S., European and Japanese economies
because they are suffering from long-term insolvency.  Central banks in those regions have created a “distorted
recovery” with asset purchases that produced a wealth effect
for a few. Average people aren’t benefiting from the market
rallies and instead are paying a lot for the “necessities in
life,” he said, adding that the situation is fueling class
warfare.  Singer said that central banks do not see the costs of
their quantitative easing.  “They think it’s for free,” Singer said. “They have the
benefits of QE but don’t see the costs.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
