Oryx Petroleum Corp. Ltd. raised
C$250.5 million ($249.7 million) in an initial public offering
after cutting the size of the sale.  Oryx Petroleum sold 16.7 million shares for C$15 each, the
Calgary-based company said in a statement. The company
originally sought to raise as much as C$350 million by marketing
the shares at C$20 to C$23 apiece, sale documents showed last
month.  Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays Plc, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch and Bank of Montreal led the sale of Addax & Oryx Group
Ltd.’s Iraq and West Africa exploration business. The stock will
trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol OXC.  Addax & Oryx is an energy firm established in 1987 by
billionaire Jean Claude Gandur, who worked in the Zug,
Switzerland office of Philipp Brothers before setting up a
Geneva oil-trading firm.  Oryx Petroleum was founded in 2010 by Addax & Oryx and
members of the former senior management team of Addax Petroleum
Corp., an exploration and production unit sold to  China ’s
Sinopec Group in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
