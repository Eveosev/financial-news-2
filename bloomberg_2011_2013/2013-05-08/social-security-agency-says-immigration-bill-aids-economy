A  Social Security Administration 
analysis said the Senate’s bipartisan immigration proposal would
boost U.S. tax revenue, create jobs and increase the gross
domestic product over the next 10 years.  Stephen Gross, chief actuary for the agency, said the bill
would have a “substantial positive effect” on the economy, in
a letter to Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican who helped
draft the legislation and requested the analysis.  The analysis, released today, may aid backers of the
legislation, which has been criticized by opponents as a drain
on the  U.S. economy . A report released earlier this week by the
Republican-leaning Heritage Foundation said that creating a path
to citizenship for about 11 million undocumented immigrants now
in the U.S. would cost taxpayers $6.3 trillion.  According to the  Social Security  Administration, the bill
would add more than $275 billion in revenue to Social Security
and Medicare, increase the gross domestic product by 1.63
percent and add more than 3 million jobs over the next decade.  The Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow plans to begin
considering hundreds of amendments to the legislation.  “The timing couldn’t be better,” said  Frank Sharry ,
executive director of immigrant-rights group America’s Voice in
Washington. “It’s a game changer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
