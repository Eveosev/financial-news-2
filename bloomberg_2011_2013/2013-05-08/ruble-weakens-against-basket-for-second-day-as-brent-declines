The ruble weakened against the central
bank’s target basket of currencies for a second day as oil fell
and  Russia  prepares for national holidays.  The ruble declined 0.5 percent against the basket of
dollars and euros to 35.5492 and sank 0.4 percent against the
dollar to 31.1735. Yields on benchmark OFZs due February 2027
increased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.81
percent by 3:43 p.m. in Moscow.  Oil in  London  dropped for a second day, falling 0.6 percent
to $103.83 per barrel after a 1 percent decline yesterday. U.S.
crude supplies increased 680,000 barrels last week, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said. The Moscow Exchange is closed
tomorrow, while Bank Rossii won’t participate in trading when
bourses reopen on May 10 and most businesses remain closed.  “We were actually expecting a stronger correction,” Artem Roschin, a foreign exchange trader at Aljba Alliance LLC in
Moscow, said by phone. “Some people prefer to leave for the
long holidays in hard-currency positions.”  The ruble will decline to 31.1000 against the dollar in the
second quarter, according to the median estimate of 26 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The currency weakened 2.2 percent to the
greenback in the first quarter to 31.0600. The ruble to dollar
pair’s 30-day volatility remained at 11.40, close to the highest
level since October last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
