Matt Harvey struck out a career-high
12 batters and allowed one hit in nine innings for the  New York
Mets  in their 1-0 home win in 10 innings against the  Chicago
White Sox .  Alex Rios’s infield single with two outs in the seventh
inning gave Chicago its only baserunner against Harvey last
night at Citi Field in  New York . Harvey, who lowered his earned
run average to 1.28, threw 105 pitches -- 76 of them strikes --
before being relieved after nine innings.  The 24-year-old right-hander is 4-0 in seven starts this
Major League Baseball season. He has allowed 22 hits in 49 1/3
innings, striking out 58 and walking 12.  Mike Baxter hit a run-scoring single with one out in the
10th inning for the Mets (13-16). Bobby Parnell (3-0) struck out
two batters in a perfect 10th for the win. Nate Jones (0-3) gave
up one run on one hit in 1 1/3 innings for the White Sox (13-18).  To contact the reporter on this story:
