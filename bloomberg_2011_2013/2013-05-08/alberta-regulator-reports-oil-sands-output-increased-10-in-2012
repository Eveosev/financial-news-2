Alberta  oil sands production increased
10 percent to 1.9 million barrels a day last year and will
double to 3.8 million by 2022, the province’s energy regulator
predicts.  The increase came even as oil sands capital expenditures
dipped 10 percent to C$20.4 billion ($20.35 billion) in 2012.
Some companies cut budgets because of “increased pressure from
lower-cost conventional oil development,” according to the
annual energy report released today by Alberta’s Energy
Resources Conservation Board.  Alberta, the center of  Canada ’s energy industry, holds the
world’s third-largest oil reserves, behind  Saudi Arabia  and
 Venezuela . Most of the reserves are in the oil sands in northern
Alberta. Oil sands reserves declined last year to 167.9 billion
barrels from 168.6 billion, the ERCB said.  The ERCB forecast that oil sands capital expenditures will
increase to $21.6 billion in 2013 and peak in 2015 at $23.4
billion.  Canada’s largest energy company,  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , cut
its capital expenditure outlook by C$850 million last year as it
delayed its Fort Hills oil sands project and said economics of
its Voyageur oil sands upgrader were challenged by rising U.S.
shale oil production.  Conventional production and reserves also rose in Canada
last year as horizontal drilling into shale- and tight-oil
basins increased, the ERCB said. Conventional output increased
14 percent to 556,000 barrels a day and conventional reserves
increased 9.5 percent to 1.7 billion barrels.  Oil sands accounted for 78 percent of Alberta’s production
last year, the ERCB said, and 2012 was the first year the
majority of oil sands production came from underground steam-
injection projects rather than mining.  Mining projects, where oil-laden sand is dug from the
ground, accounted for 48 percent of production. Steam-injection
projects, which separate the oil from the sand underground
before pumping it to the surface, made up 52 percent of
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
