Cooking oil imports  by  India , the
world’s largest palm oil buyer, probably declined for the first
time in five months in April as reserves stayed near a record
and summer heat curbed consumption of fried foods.  Purchases of vegetable oils, including those for industrial
use, fell 24 percent to 700,000 metric tons last month from
925,334 tons a year earlier, according to the median of
estimates from five processors and brokers compiled by
Bloomberg. Palm oil imports gained 9 percent to 560,000 tons
from 512,137 tons, the survey showed. The  Solvent Extractors’
Association of India  will release the data next week.  Palm oil futures in Kuala Lumpur dropped 4 percent in
April, falling for a third consecutive month, as exports
 declined  5.6 percent, according to surveyor Societe Generale de
Surveillance. World exports of seven major edible oils and fats
are expected to rise on increased imports by  China  and India,
led by higher palm oil deliveries, Oil World said May 7.  “Imports slowed because of higher stockpiles from huge
purchases in the past few months and the arrival of the new
rapeseed crop,” said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer
of the Mumbai-based broker Sunvin Group. “Local demand has been
sluggish since last month because of extreme heat in the summer
months that limit consumption of oily food.”  Inventories, including those at ports and in the pipeline,
were 2.1 million tons at the start of April and near a record of
2.12 million tons in March, extractors’ association data showed.
Cooking  oil imports  jumped 22 percent to 4.63 million tons in
the five months through March, it said.  Slow Off-take  “Stockpiles are not moving fast enough as local off-take
is slow,” Pradip Desai, managing director of Mumbai-based
broker Palmtrade Services Pvt. Ltd.  Palm oil for delivery in July advanced 1.3 percent to close
at 2,289 ringgit ($775) a ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. Futures, down 6.1 percent
this year, fell to 2,230 ringgit on May 6, the lowest price
since Dec. 13.  Exports from Malaysia fell 5.6 percent to 1.29 million tons
last month from March, SGS said on April 30. Shipments of six
vegetable oils and tallow may be 71 million tons in the
2012-2013 season from 67.5 million tons a year earlier, Oil
World said on May 7.  India, the world’s biggest cooking oil consumer after
China, meets more than half its demand through imports. It buys
palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and soybean oil from the
U.S.,  Brazil  and Argentina.  “There was some delay in shipments of soybean oil from
South America due to problems at the loading ports and the oil
should reach India this month,” Ashok Sethia, executive
director of Sethia Oils Ltd., said by phone from Kolkata. About
200,000 tons of soybean oil may arrive this month, he said.  Crude soybean oil  imports probably fell to 60,000 tons in
April from 216,509 tons a year earlier, while sunflower oil
purchases may have declined 46 percent to 70,000 tons from
129,538 tons, the survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
