Next Plc (NXT) , the U.K.’s second-largest
clothing retailer, reported first-quarter sales that beat
analysts’ estimates as a warmer end to April prompted shoppers
to buy spring fashions after a cold start to the season.  Next brand sales rose 2.2 percent in the 14 weeks ended May
4, the Leicester, England-based retailer said in a statement
today. That compares with the 1.1 percent median estimate of 11
analysts compiled by Bloomberg, and growth of 3.9 percent in the
prior quarter. Retail sales fell 1.9 percent in the period.  Next, with more than 500 stores across the U.K. and
Ireland, said earlier this year that it had a “quiet” start to
the fiscal year as the coldest March in 50 years weighed on
sales. Pent-up demand lead to a “marked upturn” in sales at
the end of the quarter, the retailer said. Next reiterated its
target for brand sales to gain 1 percent to 4 percent this
fiscal year.  “We anticipate that the continuing decline in real
earnings will depress discretionary spending for at least the
next 18 months, if not longer,” Next said in the statement.  Next  shares  fell 0.4 percent to 4,406 pence in London
trading yesterday. The stock has climbed 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
