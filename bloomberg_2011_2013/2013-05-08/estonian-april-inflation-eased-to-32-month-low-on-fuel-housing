Estonian  inflation  slowed more than
economists forecast in April to the weakest pace in 32 months as
the cost of fuel and housing declined.  Consumer prices rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier, the
least since August 2010 and down from 3.5 percent in March, the
statistics office, based in the capital, Tallinn, said today on
its  website . That fell short of all estimates in a Bloomberg
survey of five analysts, whose median forecast was 3.4 percent.
Prices declined 0.1 percent from the previous month after rising
0.7 percent in March.  Average inflation in the newest euro member will slow to
3.4 percent this year from 3.9 percent in 2012 as global food
and fuel prices decline, the  Finance Ministry  forecast last
month. Still, domestic factors such as growing wage costs may
pressure price growth starting in the second half, according to
the central bank.  Fuel prices declined 6.6 percent from a year earlier,
reducing transport costs by 4.6 percent, the statistics office
said. Housing costs declined 0.2 percent in the month, trimming
the annual increase to 9.7 percent as prices for electricity and
heating fell.  One-third of  Estonia ’s industrial companies expect to hire
more workers this year with 51 percent planning to raise wages
by as much as 8 percent, according to a survey of about 200
companies by Swedbank AB’s local unit, published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
