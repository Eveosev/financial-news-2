South African wheat futures gained for
a second day after the rand declined against the dollar, making
imports more expensive and raising demand for locally produced
cereal.  Wheat for delivery in July, the most active contract, rose
0.3 percent to 3,471 rand ($384) per metric ton by the close on
the South African Futures Exchange. White corn in the same month
fell 0.2 percent to 2,146 rand a ton while the yellow variety
dropped 0.2 percent to 2,135 rand.  The rand weakened for a third day, slipping 0.4 percent to
as much as 9.0714 per dollar during today’s trading session. It
has lost 6.4 percent this year, the worst performer among 25
emerging-market currencies against the dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  South Africa , a net importer of wheat,
hasn’t brought in the cereal for the past two weeks, the grain
information services said yesterday.  “Because we import the grain, this affects the import
parity,” Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader, said by pone
from Kroonstad in the Free State province. “International
prices and the rand played a role.”  South  Africa  produced 1.87 million tons in 2012, 7 percent
less than a year earlier, the Crop Estimates Committee said
yesterday.  The nation is sub-Saharan Africa’s largest producer of the
grain after  Ethiopia  and the region’s biggest importer after
Nigeria and  Sudan , according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
