Ethanol was steady against gasoline
following a government report that showed production at the
smallest level in three weeks and stockpiles of the biofuel at
an 18-month low.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 0.04 cent to
27.08 cents a gallon, after the Energy Information
Administration said  inventories  dropped 1.1 percent to 16.8
million barrels, a second weekly decline and the lowest level
since Nov. 4, 2011. Production slid to 843,000 barrels a day.  “I thought we’d get a stock build and it was a draw,”
said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa . “Production was a draw, and that was a surprise to me,
too.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.583 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 17 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery advanced 2.04 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.8538 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol production is down 6 percent from a year earlier as
the biofuel struggles to return to levels prior to last summer’s
drought that devastated corn crops and cut returns on making the
additive.  Cycling Through  “We’ve gone through a period where production rates have
been down and we’ve gotten stocks down to a point in some areas
where they have to scramble,” Blackford said. “It takes a
while to cycle through.”  Corn for July delivery declined 7 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$6.33 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread for July was 17 cents a gallon, up
from 13 cents yesterday. That compares with minus 35 cents on
Dec. 31. The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production,
which can be fed to livestock.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up a record 97 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, up from 96 percent the previous week,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm said.  For a second week, there were no U.S. imports.  Spot ethanol in  Sao Paulo  fetched $2.50 a gallon in the
week ended May 3, down 3 percent from the previous week, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  In U.S. cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago fell 1.5
cent to $2.685 a gallon; in the U.S. Gulf the additive slipped 1
cent to $2.75; in  New York  prices gained 1 cent to $2.91; and on
the West Coast the biofuel jumped 1 cent to $2.81, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf expanded 2
cents to 6 cents and Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
expanded 2.5 cents to 22.5 cents, the widest since Dec. 9, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
