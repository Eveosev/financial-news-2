The U.K. is looking at ways to help
police trace criminals who use the Internet to communicate after
Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  killed off plans by  David Cameron ’s Conservatives to monitor e-mail data.  Setting out its legislative program in Parliament in London
today, the government said it would look instead at ways of
making Internet service providers log which Internet protocol
addresses had been allocated to which customers.  This would allow police to see who had sent a particular e-
mail or been involved in a conversation via Microsoft Corp.’s
Skype online calling service or similar applications, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
