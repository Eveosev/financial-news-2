Asian  stocks  advanced for a third day,
with the regional benchmark index rising to a five-year high, as
 China ’s exports topped estimates and companies including HSBC
Holdings Plc posted earnings that cheered investors.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-biggest maker of
construction and mining equipment, advanced 4.4 percent in  Tokyo 
to lead industrial companies higher. HSBC gained 1.7 percent in
Hong Kong after the lender beat analysts’ estimates for profit.
 Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the No. 2 maker of flash memory, slumped 5
percent in Tokyo before it reported missing its earnings
forecast after close of market.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1 percent to 143.44 as
of 6:20 p.m. in Tokyo, with all 10 industry groups rising. The
measure increased 9.8 percent this year through yesterday amid
speculation the Bank of  Japan  will deploy more measures to beat
deflation as policy makers in the U.S. and  Europe  remain on
standby to buoy growth.  “Markets are being driven by heightened stimulus,” said
Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head of investment market
research at Perpetual Ltd., which manages about $25 billion.
“Economic data remains in the Goldilocks range -- weak enough
to warrant continued stimulus, but strong enough to keep
earnings expectations positive.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  climbed 0.7 percent. The
broader Topix Index rose 0.5 percent extending a 4 1/2-year
high. The gauge has rallied 65 percent since mid-November,
making it the world’s best-performing major stock index.  Australia Rates  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  gained 1.1 percent, the
highest close in five years. Swap contracts show a better than
50 percent chance the Reserve Bank of Australia will lower its
benchmark interest rate in July, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The bank cut the rate to a record low yesterday and
signaled that slowing inflation gives it room to ease policy.  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added 0.4 percent as the
country’s central bank’s governor said today he has scope to cut
rates.  South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 0.1 percent.  Singapore ’s
Straits Times Index advanced 0.9 percent, and Taiwan’s Taiex
Index climbed 1.3 percent.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  increased 0.9 percent, while
the Shanghai Composite gained 0.5 percent.  China’s exports rose 14.7 percent in April, topping the 9.2
percent increase estimated by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Imports climbed 16.8 percent in April, beating expectations for
a 13 percent gain.  Industrial Shares  Komatsu, which gets almost 10 percent of its sales in
China, advanced 4.4 percent to 2,728 yen. The shares led a gauge
of industrial companies on the regional benchmark to a 1.4
percent advance, the most among the 10 groups.  The MSCI Asia Pacific yesterday traded at 14.3 times
average estimated earnings compared with 14.7 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 13.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL) , the world’s No. 1 palm-oil
processor, climbed 2.7 percent to S$3.40 in Singapore as first-
quarter profit surged 23 percent. Net income was $315.4 million
in the three months ended March 31, beating the $296.5 million
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  HSBC, (5)  Europe’s biggest lender, gained 1.7 percent to
HK$87.70 in Hong Kong after posting a bigger-than-estimated
increase in first-quarter profit as provisions for bad loans
shrank, stirring speculation the lender may step up its cost-
reduction targets.  Toshiba Drops  Among stocks that fell today, Toshiba sank 5 percent to 512
yen in Tokyo. Net income at the maker of memory chips,
televisions and nuclear reactors rose 11 percent to 77.5 billion
yen ($784 million), missing its 100 billion yen forecast.  Of the 123 companies on the Asia-Pacific gauge that have
reported  quarterly earnings  in the past four weeks, and for
which Bloomberg has estimates, 54 percent have missed
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The gauge yesterday added 0.5 percent to 1,625.96, a
record close, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above
15,000 for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
