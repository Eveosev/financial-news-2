German water consumption in 2012
remained at its lowest in more than two decades for a third
year, the BDEW utility lobby said.  Each German consumed about 32 gallons (121 liters) of water
a day on average, the same as in 2011 and 2010 and down from
almost 39 gallons in 1990, BDEW said today in an e-mailed
statement. The average American uses 80 gallons to 100 gallons
of water a day, according to  U.S. Geological Survey  figures.  Investments from utilities in  Germany ’s water
infrastructure are expected to reach 2.4 billion euros ($3.2
billion) this year and next from 2.3 billion euros in 2012, BDEW
also said.  Reduced private and industrial water consumption “has led
in part to an underutilization of the existing infrastructure
and leaves hardly any leeway for declines,” the lobby said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
