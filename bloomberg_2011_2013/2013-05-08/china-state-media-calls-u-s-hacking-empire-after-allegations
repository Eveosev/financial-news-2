The official newspaper of  China ’s
Communist Party responded today to a Pentagon report that
accused the Chinese military of cyber espionage by calling the
U.S. the “real hacking empire.”  The U.S. has an extensive cyber espionage network that
targets hostile countries as well as its allies, said a
commentary published today that was attributed to an author
identified as Zhong Sheng, a name that’s a homonym in Chinese
for “voice of China.” The allegations in the Pentagon’s May 6
report create an “imaginary enemy,” it said.  Concern that the breach of U.S. corporate and government
computers may give China access to confidential information has
weighed on ties between the world’s two biggest economies as
they also seek to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula, limit
 Iran ’s development of nuclear technology and support global
growth. The two nations have agreed to form a working group on
cybersecurity issues, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff
Martin Dempsey said during a visit to Beijing last month.  The Pentagon report this week said China has targeted U.S.
government computers with intrusions that seek sensitive data.
The incursions “appear to be attributable directly to the
Chinese government and military,” it said.  The U.S. has been preparing for an “online war” since it
set up its cyber espionage network, the People’s Daily
commentary said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
