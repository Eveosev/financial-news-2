The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will
extend its record rally as the U.S. central bank continues using
economic stimulus as a way to reduce unemployment, according to
Scott Black, president of Boston-based Delphi Management Inc.  He recommended buying shares of  Ensco PLC (ESV) , a London-based
oil-drilling company, and  Amdocs Ltd. (DOX) , which produces
telecommunications software in Chesterfield, Missouri. Companies
in the S&P 500 will earn about $105 a share this year, Black
said. That’s a 3.9 percent increase from last year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “There’s room to go on the upside, especially since you’re
getting nothing on the fixed-income side,” Black said in an
interview on Bloomberg Radio’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene 
and  Michael McKee  from Boston. “There’s every indication that
Ben Bernanke is going to remain accommodative because we’re not
even near the threshold where he wants to get unemployment back
under 6.5 percent.”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has kept overnight
interest  rates  near zero since December 2008 and embarked on a
bond buying program that has expanded the central bank’s balance
sheet to more than $3 trillion. The Fed has pledged to maintain
this policy as long as U.S. unemployment remains above 6.5
percent and the outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5
percent.  U.S. employment picked up more than forecast in April and
the jobless rate unexpectedly declined to a four-year low of 7.5
percent, according to a report from the Labor Department last
week.  The  S&P 500  rose to 1,625.96 yesterday for its fourth
straight record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased
to 15,056.20 for its first close above 15,000.  The S&P 500 may finish the year at 1,601 with earnings per
share of $108.42, according to the average estimate of equity
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. The benchmark gauge for
American equity is trading at 15.9 times reported earnings, the
highest multiple since 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
