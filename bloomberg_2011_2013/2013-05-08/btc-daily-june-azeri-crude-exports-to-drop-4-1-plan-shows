Daily exports of Azeri Light crude
from a port in Turkey will decline by 4.1 percent in June from
this month, according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg
News .  Shipments will total 21.15 million barrels, or 705,000
barrels a day, compared with 735,484 barrels a day in May, the
schedule showed.  The 1,768-kilometer (1,100-mile) Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline carries Azeri Light crude from Baku, in the Azeri
section of the Caspian Sea, through Georgia to the port of
Ceyhan, on Turkeyâ€™s Mediterranean coast.  BP Plc (BP/)  holds a 30
percent stake in the pipeline.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
