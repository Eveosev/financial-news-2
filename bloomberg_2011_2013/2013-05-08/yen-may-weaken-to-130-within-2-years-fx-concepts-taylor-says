The yen will decline to 130 per dollar
within two years as foreign investment in Japanese bonds wanes
amid a climbing rate of inflation, according to  John Taylor  of
FX Concepts LLC.  It is unclear what  Bank of Japan  policies will be once the
country achieves its current goal of 2 percent inflation, said
Taylor, the founder and chief executive officer of currency-hedge fund FX Concepts LLC. European and American investors will
be hesitant to purchase 10-year Japanese  government bonds  at
that point, leaving the country to rely on domestic demand, he
said. The last time the yen traded at 130 was 2002.  “The government still needs to borrow, and if Japanese 10-year  interest rates  go up, that’s going to ruin the Japanese
government financial situation,” Taylor said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with Francine Lacqua and
 Guy Johnson .  Japan’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 98.83 per
dollar at 11:34 a.m. in New York after climbing to 98.58, its
strongest level in almost a week. The yen decreased 0.6 percent
to 130.23 per euro.  The yen may take until August to weaken below 100 per
dollar, according to Taylor, a level unseen since 2009. The
global economy may experience a dip in the third quarter,
something that is “usually good for Japan and the yen
strengthening,” he said.  Japan’s monetary policy, aimed at reaching 2 percent
 inflation  in two years, has weakened the yen 12 percent in 2013,
the most out of 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Group of 20 finance chiefs and central bankers meeting on
April 19 praised the measures taken by the BOJ this month aimed
at boosting economic growth. The BOJ maintained a pledge to
double its monetary base, but didn’t outline any additional
measures to meet its inflation target in an April 26 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
