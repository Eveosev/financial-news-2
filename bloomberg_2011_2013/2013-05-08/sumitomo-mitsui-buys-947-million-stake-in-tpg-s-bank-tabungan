Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) 
agreed to buy 40 percent of Indonesia’s  PT Bank Tabungan
Pensiunan Nasional (BTPN)  for about $1.5 billion, the Japanese lender’s
biggest purchase of a foreign financial firm.  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., the lending unit of  Japan ’s
second-biggest bank by market value, is buying 24.3 percent of
BTPN at 6,500 rupiah a share from investors including TPG
Capital and plans to increase the stake to 40 percent, the
Tokyo-based company said in a statement yesterday. The shares
are being sold at a premium of 14 percent on yesterday’s close.  Japan’s three biggest banks, including  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306)  and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , are
accelerating overseas takeovers as deflation discourages
borrowing at home.  Indonesia  is the most lucrative market for
loans among the world’s 20 biggest economies, while Japan is the
least profitable in Asia, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Southeast Asian countries are a must for Japanese banks’
overseas expansion,” said Toyoki Sameshima, a Tokyo-based
analyst at BNP Paribas SA. “We have started to sense the
possibility that Japanese banks can become global lenders.”  The Japanese bank is buying the 24.3 percent stake from May
8 to May 10 for 9.2 trillion rupiah ($946 million), it said in
the statement. It plans to purchase an additional 15.7 percent
from TPG later, subject to regulatory approval. The 40 percent
stake will cost about 150 billion yen ($1.5 billion), said Sohei
Nishimaki, a Tokyo-based spokesman at Sumitomo Mitsui.  Shares Fall  Shares of Sumitomo Mitsui fell 0.8 percent to 4,640 yen at
11:30 a.m. in Tokyo. BTPN slid 1.7 percent to 5,700 rupiah at
yesterday’s close in Jakarta, giving it a market value of 33.3
trillion rupiah.  Investing in BTPN will give Sumitomo Mitsui President
 Koichi Miyata , 59, greater access to Southeast Asia’s most
populous nation and fastest-growing economy. The Indonesian
bank, originally a lender to retired civil servants, has rallied
more than 10-fold since began trading on March 14, 2008.  “BTPN has a unique business model and offers a wide range
of services focusing on the mass market,” Sumitomo Mitsui said
in the statement. Indonesia “is expected to record rapid and
sustainable growth driven by its large population” and
expanding middle class, it added.  Banks such as  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS)  are looking to expand
in Indonesia as its households gain spending power. The
country’s central bank has said it plans to rule this month on
Singapore-based DBS’s proposed $6.8 billion takeover of  PT Bank
Danamon Indonesia. (BDMN)   Fastest Growth  Gross domestic product in Indonesia will expand 6.3 percent
this year, the fastest pace in the region, the International
Monetary Fund forecast in April.  Indonesian banks have the best loan profitability among the
world’s 20 biggest economies, based on the 7.3 percent average
net interest margin of lenders with a market value of more than
$5 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In Japan, the
average among lenders on the Topix Banks Index is 1.33 percent,
the slimmest in Asia, the data show.  Sumitomo Mitsui reported a net interest margin of 1.16
percent for the three months through December. At Jakarta-based
BTPN, that metric stood at 13 percent in the same period.  BTPN has 19,000 employees and more than 1,000 branches. It
boosted profit by 41 percent to 1.98 trillion rupiah last year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Earnings have jumped more than
five times since 2008, the first full year after TPG made its
initial investment in the lender.  TPG, a Fort Worth, Texas-based private equity firm,  owned 
58 percent of BTPN as of Dec. 31, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Investing Abroad  Sumitomo Mitsui has stepped up investments abroad over the
past year. In December, it paid HK$3.3 billion ($425 million) to
double its stake in  Bank of East Asia Ltd. , Hong Kong’s largest
family-run lender, to 9.5 percent. The bank was also part of a
group that bought Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s aircraft
leasing unit for about $7.3 billion in 2012.  In 2007, Sumitomo Mitsui bought 15 percent of Vietnam
Export-Import Commercial Joint Stock Bank, known as Eximbank,
for $225 million.  Mitsubishi UFJ in December agreed a 15.5 trillion dong
($740 million) deal to buy 20 percent of VietinBank, or Vietnam
Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade. Japan’s
largest bank has also expressed interest in purchasing a stake
in Bangkok-based  Bank of Ayudhya Pcl  from General Electric Co.,
lending unit Deputy President Takashi Morimura said in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
