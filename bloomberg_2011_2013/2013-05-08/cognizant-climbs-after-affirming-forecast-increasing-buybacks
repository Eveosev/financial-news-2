Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH) ,
a provider of consulting and outsourcing services, rose the most
in nine months after reaffirming its annual forecast and
increasing its stock buyback program.  The shares gained 5 percent to $68.15 in New York trading
after Cognizant’s quarterly results were released this morning,
marking the biggest one-day increase since Aug. 6. The stock has
declined 7.8 percent this year.  The Teaneck, New Jersey-based company reiterated a
projection for annual revenue to rise at least 17 percent to
$8.6 billion, saying its customer relationships were helping it
lead the industry in sales growth. Cognizant also increased its
repurchase program by $500 million to $1.5 billion.  “Our performance during the first quarter was strong, and
we are encouraged by the healthy demand for our broad range of
services,” Chief Executive Officer Francisco D’Souza said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
