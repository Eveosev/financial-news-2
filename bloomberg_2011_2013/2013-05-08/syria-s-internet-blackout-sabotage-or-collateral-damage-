Syria's peek-a-boo game with the Internet resumed yesterday, as Internet connections to the outside world were  disrupted . Just before 3 p.m. Eastern Time yesterday, Google Inc.'s Web services in Syria were inaccessible, according to the company's  transparency report , which tracks disruptions in the search provider's products. Other Web companies also  reported  outages.  Internet blackouts in Syria are becoming routine. This outage is similar to the  Nov. 29 service disruption , which lasted for two days. The Syrian government has said it's working to repair the problem. The Syrian Telecommunications Establishment, a government-related company, said the outage was caused by a malfunction in a fiber-optic cable. But security experts suspect the Syrian government of foul play, the New York Times  reports . Technology has been a  weapon  on both sides of Syria's two-year conflict between President Bashar al-Assad and his opponents as battles have spread from the streets to the Web, and Internet and social media use have increased.  Renesys, a network security firm that studies Internet disruptions,  attributes  the recurring outages in part to the fragile nature of Syria's Internet and the lack of service-provider diversity. CloudFlare, an Internet security firm, put together this  video  showing the disruption.  As Bloomberg View has  written , recent escalations of the Syrian conflict demand more international action. The U.S. and Russia will press the Syrian government to participate in talks to end the conflict, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said yesterday.  This blackout reinforces the need for  Internet freedom  to be on that agenda.  (Kirsten Salyer is social media editor for Bloomberg View.  Follow  her on Twitter.)
