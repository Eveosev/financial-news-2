Gasoline in  Los Angeles  weakened
against futures for the first time in seven days after
 California ’s stockpiles of the fuel jumped 14 percent and U.S.
West Coast supplies gained after 12 weeks of declines.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, inventories surged by
546,000 barrels to 4.56 million in the week ended May 3, the
state Energy Commission’s website shows. Supplies reached a
record low of 4.01 million barrels a week earlier.  Gasoline stockpiles on the U.S. West Coast advanced for the
first time since Feb. 1, snapping the  longest streak  of declines
on record. Supplies in the PADD 5 region gained  298,000 barrels 
to 26.2 million barrels last week, data from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical
arm, showed today.  Carbob in Los Angeles weakened 5.5 cents to 39 cents a
gallon over gasoline futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 3:53 p.m., data compiled by Bloomberg show. The same
fuel in  San Francisco  also dropped 5.5 cents to 31 cents a
gallon above futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed for the
first time in seven days, shrinking $1.89 to $24.41 a barrel.
The spread, a rough measure of refining margins, reached a two-month high yesterday.  West Coast stockpiles climbed as refineries including
 Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s Anacortes,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Richmond and  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Martinez plants were starting units following
repairs. Chevron’s 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo refinery, the
largest in California, restarted equipment late last month after
a two-month turnaround.  To contact the reporters on this story:
