General Motors Co. (GM) , which will start
delivering redesigned Chevrolet Silverado pickups to dealers
this month, said most of its full-size truck deliveries this
year will be of current-generation vehicles.  “Some time in the fourth quarter we’re going to start
retailing more new than old,” Chris Perry, Chevy U.S. marketing
vice president, said yesterday in an interview at a ranch
outside San Antonio.  The redesign of the Silverado and its GMC brand
counterpart, the Sierra, are among about 20 new vehicles GM is
bringing out this year to renew a lineup that grew stale
following the company’s 2009 bankruptcy reorganization. The
company’s U.S. market share fell to an 88-year-low in 2012 as
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s sales rebounded. Toyota’s U.S. comeback
helped it overtake GM as the world’s best-selling automaker.  About 70 percent of Silverado sales this year will be the
older version, Maria Rohrer, marketing director of Chevy full-sized pickups, said in an interview. The new 2014 model year
double cab goes on sale in the third quarter followed by the
regular cab a month to 45 days later, she said. The heavy-duty
version will be shown at the Texas State Fair in the fourth
quarter, she said.  The revamped pickups are among the most important for
Detroit-based GM. Silverado and Sierra version deliveries
combined made up 22 percent of the company’s U.S. sales last
year and Silverado was the company’s top-selling model. Full-size pickups make up the biggest source of profit for U.S.-based
automakers GM,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC.  Crew Cabs  GM aims to boost the mix of more-expensive crew cabs from
about 50 percent toward to more than 60 percent, Perry said.  “That’s where some of our competitors have gone strong
with the crew cab,” Perry said.  GM finished April with 228,524 full-sized pickups in its
inventory, or a 103-day supply, the company said May 1.  While GM hasn’t said what’s its truck inventory goal is for
the year, the automaker finished 2012 with more than 221,000
pickups in inventory, roughly in line with its previously stated
year-end goal of 200,000 to 220,000.  The 2014 Silverado with a 5.3-liter V-8 engine and two-wheel drive will get 23 miles (37 kilometers) per gallon in
highway driving, the automaker has said. Ford’s 3.5-liter, six-cylinder turbo F-150 gets 22 mpg on the highway while a flex-fuel version of the vehicle gets 23 mpg, according to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. A flex-fuel 5-liter V-8 F-150
gets 21 mpg on the highway.  The new Silverado will start at $23,590 while the Sierra
will start at $24,090, the company said. The prices don’t
include a $995 freight charge.  GM fell 1.3 percent to $31.65 at the close in New York. The
shares have gained 9.8 percent this year compared with a 14
percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
