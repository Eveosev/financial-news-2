 The 1.7 billion downloads of Angry Birds since its 2009 release are just the beginning for Rovio Entertainment.  Now the Finland-based company plans to use that success to change the way online video is distributed by turning its games into one of the world's biggest video networks, Chief Marketing Officer  Peter Vesterbacka told the Global Mobile Internet Conference  in Beijing.  In March, Rovio launched “Angry Birds Tunes”, an animated series made in-house. Every week there is a new “Angry Birds Tunes” episode, running about three minutes, that can be accessed from inside the game.  “In our games, all 1.7 billion of them, we added the watch button for Angry Birds Tunes so, with one click, you are connected to our Angry Birds Tunes channel,” Vesterbacka said. “Why not create one of the biggest video distribution networks on the planet using our games? They are not just games. They are distribution points that happen to be on more devices, more smartphones, more tablets, more connected smart TVs than pretty much anything else out there.”  In its first six weeks alone, the channel has had 150 million views. “That's pretty good for a network that didn't exist at the beginning of the year,” says Vesterbacka. “We're off to a good start with Angry Birds Tunes but you can expect to see a lot more in that area.”   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Edmond Lococo in Beijing at elococo@bloomberg.net
