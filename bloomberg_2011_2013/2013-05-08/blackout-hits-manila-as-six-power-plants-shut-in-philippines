Manila  and almost half the largest
island in the  Philippines  suffered a blackout after six  power
plants  shut down.  A “tripping” of transmission lines triggered failures at
plants with a combined output of 3,700 megawatts, Energy
Secretary Jericho Petilla told reporters today in Manila.
National Grid Corp. of the Philippines, which operates the
transmission lines, said it was caused by a “generation
deficiency.”  The power stations, including the Sual coal plant and
Ilijan gas plant managed by San Miguel Corp., supply about 45
percent of the peak-power requirements of Luzon, home to more
than 44 million people. Transmission lines and power is expected
to be fully restored by midnight, National Grid spokeswoman
Cynthia Alabanza said today at a briefing.  About three-quarters of Luzon already has power, and
electricity in 89 percent of Manila Electric’s more than 5.1
million customers had been restored, she said.  The shutdown was caused by an “external grid event,” said
Julicer Alvis, a manager for the Sta. Rita and San Lorenzo
plants.  Petilla ruled out sabotage and said the  power outage  was
likely the result of transmission failures. “The likelihood of
five power plants bogging down is extremely unlikely,” Petilla
said. “It’s the lines that caused the brownouts.”  The blackout started at 2 p.m. and affected about 40
percent of the franchise area of  Manila Electric Co. (MER) , the
nation’s biggest power retailer, according to spokesman Joe
Zaldarriaga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
