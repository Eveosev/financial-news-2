Digital Realty Trust Inc. (DLR)  is a stock
to sell short because the manager of data-center real estate
relies on access to  capital markets  to fund its dividend,
Jonathon Jacobson of Highfields Capital Management LP said.  “Pricing is going lower, competition is increasing, and
the company is tapping into capital markets as aggressively as
they can,” Jacobson, the founder and chief executive officer of
$11 billion investment firm Highfields, said today at the 18th
Ira Sohn Investment Conference in  New York . “Do you want to pay
three times book value for this?”  The San Francisco-based company fell 6.9 percent to $64.25
at 6:22 p.m. New York time in extended U.S. trading. Jacobson 
said the fair value of Digital Realty is about $20 a share. Its 
dividend yield is 4.5 percent, compared with 2 percent for the 
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to Bloomberg data.  The rate of recurring  capital expenditures  is
“materially” higher than the company represents, according to
Jacobson. Digital Realty’s competition includes cloud businesses
from companies such as Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., and from
other data centers that have joined the field since there is no
barrier to entry, he said.  Investors have sold short about 18 million shares of
Digital Realty, or 14 percent of the total outstanding,
according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
