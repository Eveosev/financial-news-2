James Chanos , founder of Kynikos
Associates Ltd., said he was betting against  Seagate Technology
Plc (STX)  as the switch to cloud computing reduces demand for hard
disk drives.  “We think that mean reversion will happen in this
business, sooner rather than later,” he said at the Sohn
Investment Conference in New York today.  Seagate shares, which closed at a record $42.32 today in
New York, fell 4.3 percent in electronic trading. The shares
have advanced 39 percent so far this year.  Chanos said there is a lot of insider selling at Dublin-based Seagate. The hard-disk drive business is suffering as the
amount of disk storage exceeds demand and that cloud computing
is more efficient for personal-computer users, Chanos said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
