The  Swiss National Bank ’s cap on the
franc is still necessary and the central bank has to use other
measures to control Switzerland’s booming  property market , said
Vice President Jean-Pierre Danthine.  “The minimum  exchange rate  remains indispensable,”
Danthine said at a conference in Lausanne, Switzerland today.
“We don’t have the option of using interest rates” to correct
developments in the property market, he said. “We use other
measures.”  Switzerland is in the midst of its strongest  housing boom 
in two decades, fueled in part by the SNB’s loose monetary
policy that has made taking on debt inexpensive. In a bid to
thwart risky lending, the government in February ordered banks
to hold additional capital as a buffer. The measure, implemented
at the behest of the SNB, takes effect from Sept. 30.  The central bank has held its benchmark  interest rate  at
zero since August 2011 and in September of that year capped the
franc at 1.20 per euro to shield the economy from the crisis in
the neighboring euro region.  “The rising dynamic of the real-estate market and of
mortgage lending cannot continue indefinitely,” Danthine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
