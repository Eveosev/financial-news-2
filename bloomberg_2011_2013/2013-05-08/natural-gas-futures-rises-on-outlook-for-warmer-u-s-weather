Natural gas futures climbed from a
one-month low in  New York  on speculation that periods of
unusually hot weather in the U.S. will spur demand for the
power-plant fuel to run air conditioners.  Gas rose as much as 1.4 percent as Commodity Weather Group
LLC predicted a surge of heat in the mid-Atlantic states late
next week and above-normal temperatures from  California  to the
Midwest from May 13 through May 22. Gas has dropped 11 percent
from a 21-month intraday high a week ago after a government
report showed a larger-than-forecast stockpile gain.  ”We are seeing a little bit of a bounce off this selloff
we’ve had for the past several days,” said Brad Florer, a
trader at Kottke Associates LLC in Louisville,  Kentucky .  Natural gas for June delivery gained 5 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.97 per million British thermal units at 9:19 a.m.
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after settling yesterday at
the lowest price since April 4. Trading was 3.2 percent below
the 100-day average for the time of day. Prices are up 18
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
