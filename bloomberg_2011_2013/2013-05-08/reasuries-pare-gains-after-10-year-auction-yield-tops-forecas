Treasuries rose for the first time in
four days as the highest yields in almost four weeks bolstered
demand at the government’s $24 billion auction of 10-year notes,
the second of three note and bond sales this week.  Yields on the  benchmark security  had dropped last week to
the lowest level since December before climbing after a report
on May 3 showed the economy added more jobs than forecast last
month. Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 33.9 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 36.4 percent for the past 10 sales. Treasury
will complete its sales tomorrow with a $16 billion auction of
30-year bonds.  “The selloff of the past few days has allowed us to drift
to the upper end of the range where there is some relative
value, given where we’ve been,” said Carlos Pro, an interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in  New York , one of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 21  primary dealers obligated to bid at
U.S. debt sales. “The market is correcting itself after the
selloff of the last couple of days.”  The current 10-year yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.77 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2
percent note due in February 2023 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per
$1,000 face value, to 102 3/32. The yield fell as much as three
basis points earlier after reaching the highest level since
April 11.  Bid Data  The notes drew a yield of 1.810 percent, compared with a
forecast of 1.794 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 of
the Federal Reserve’s primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.70, compared with an average of 2.92
for the previous 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.9 percent of
the notes, compared with an average of 24 percent at the last 10
auctions.  “The market was expecting a bit of a stronger auction, but
the results were generally indifferent,” said  Sean Murphy , a
trader at Societe Generale SA in New York, a primary dealer.
“We could see a bit of a dip into tomorrow’s auction, given the
price action.”  Treasury is due to sell $16 billion of 30-year debt
tomorrow. The three sales will raise $12.4 billion of new cash,
as maturing securities held by the public total $59.6 billion,
according to the Treasury.  Demand Pattern  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$777 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $3.01 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, according to data released by the Treasury and
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ten-year  U.S. debt  has returned 0.5 percent this year, more
than the 0.3 percent gain in the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
benchmark notes returned 4.2 percent in 2012, compared with a
2.2 percent gain by Treasuries overall.  The benchmark yield has increased from this year’s low of
1.61 percent set last week after a report showed the
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to a four-year low of 7.5
percent.  The difference between yields on 10- and 30-year debt
widened to 1.22 percentage points, the most since April 5 and
above the one-year average of 1.17 percentage points.
Historically, a so-called steeper yield curve reflects
diminishing demand from investors anticipating faster economic
growth and inflation.  Market Options  “The 10-year Treasury still offers a diversification
benefit that few other assets enjoy,” William Irving, a
Merrimack, New Hampshire-based money manager at  Fidelity
Investments , which oversees $1.6 trillion, said in an interview
with  Tom Keene  on  Bloomberg Radio . “Even though the yield is
low, they still offer the possibility of going up in price when
there is a flight to quality.”  The Fed bought $3.6 billion of Treasuries maturing between
February 2019 and April 2020 today, according to the Fed Bank of
New York’s  website . The central bank is buying $85 billion of
Treasury and mortgage debt each month to support the economy by
putting downward pressure on borrowing costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
