Health Care REIT Inc. (HCN)  agreed to buy a
75 percent stake in 47 senior housing communities in  Canada  from
Revera Inc. for about $1 billion in cash and assumed debt.  Revera, Canada’s second-largest operator of senior housing
and long-term care facilities, will continue to manage the
properties, Health Care REIT said in a statement today. The deal
includes communities in Toronto, Ottawa,  Vancouver , Calgary,
Saskatoon and Winnipeg.  “We now own more than 13,000 units of private pay seniors
housing in Canada, with a concentration in infill locations in
major metropolitan markets” in partnership with two local
operators, Health Care REIT Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
George L. Chapman said in the statement.  Demand for assisted-living and senior housing is expected
to rise as Canada’s population ages. The number of residents age
65 and over will double through 2036, according to the
government’s Human Resources and Skills Development Canada
agency.  Health Care REIT, based in Toledo,  Ohio , will use $697
million of cash to pay for the purchase and take on about $314
million of mortgage debt. It owns 1,133 property portfolios in
the U.S., U.K. and Canada. Revera, based in Mississauga,
Ontario, manages 20,000 senior home and long-term care units,
according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
