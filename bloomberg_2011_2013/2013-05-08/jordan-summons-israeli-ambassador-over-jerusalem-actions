Jordan summoned  Israel ’s ambassador to
Amman and expressed its “strong” condemnation of Israeli
actions at a holy site in  Jerusalem , the official Petra news
agency said.  Interior Minister and acting Foreign Minister Hussein al- Majali spoke to the ambassador hours after Jordan’s parliament
unanimously asked the Cabinet to demand that he be forced to
leave Amman and that Jordan’s envoy be recalled from Israel,
Petra said.  Israeli police detained the top Palestinian Muslim cleric,
Sheikh Muhammad Hussain, for questioning today after
disturbances yesterday at the shrine, known to Jews as Temple
Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. Hussain was later
released without charge.  Police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said the cleric was
detained on suspicion of incitement. Chairs were thrown from the
site at a visiting Jewish group and Hussain was “suspected of
involvement,” Rosenfeld said by phone.  Jordan and Egypt are the only two Arab countries with a
peace treaty with Israel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
