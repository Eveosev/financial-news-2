Bloomberg showed. Sugar production in Thailand is running at
4,000 to 6,000 metric tons a day as mills continue to re-melt
raw sugar into the white, or refined variety, F.O. Licht GmbH
said in a report on May 2. Thai producers have been “blamed for
knocking down the white premium,”  Michael McDougall , head of
the Brazil desk at broker Newedge Group in  New York , said in a
report yesterday.  “There are some corners of the trade, it seems, who
believe we will be ‘awash’ with whites, perhaps on an argument
of Thai’s deliverable availability, recent high whites premium,
early Ramadan,”  Thomas Kujawa , co-head of soft commodities
Sucden Financial Ltd. in London, wrote in a report e-mailed
yesterday.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August fell 0.7
