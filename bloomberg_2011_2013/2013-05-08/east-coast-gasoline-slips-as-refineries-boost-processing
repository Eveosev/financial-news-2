U.S. East Coast gasoline weakened
versus futures after a government reported showed regional
refineries processed the most crude  since September 2011 ,
boosting inventories in the area for a second week.  East Coast plants refined  1.2 million barrels  of crude and
other feedstock in the week ended May 3, Energy Information
Administration data show. Stockpiles of motor fuel in the
Central Atlantic region including  New York  Harbor, or PADD 1B,
climbed 366,000 barrels to 32.8 million, the most in a month.  The areaâ€™s gasoline supplies may rise further as oil
traders plan to increase cargoes in the next two weeks by the
most since Jan. 4, according to a Bloomberg survey. Imports tend
to stay higher during the so-called driving season, when U.S.
gasoline demand peaks, between the Memorial Day holiday in late
May and Labor Day in early September.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in New York
Harbor  weakened  0.13 cent to a discount of 0.13 cent a gallon
below futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:56 p.m.
Conventional gasoline, or CBOB, shrank by 0.63 cent to 14.13
cents under futures.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in the New York Harbor, a rough
measure of refining margins based on Brent oil in  Europe ,
dropped 45 cents to $16.65 a barrel.  Oil traders plan to hire 33 Medium Range tankers on the
Rotterdam-to-New York route for loading in the next two weeks,
according to a survey of shipbrokers. That compares with 21
charters in the corresponding survey on April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
