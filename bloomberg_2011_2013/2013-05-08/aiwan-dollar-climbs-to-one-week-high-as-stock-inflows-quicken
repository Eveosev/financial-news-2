Taiwan’s dollar advanced to the
strongest level in three months after global funds accelerated
purchases of local equities and as the island’s benchmark share
index touched a 21-month high.  Overseas investors added an average $196 million a day to
holdings of Taiwanese stocks this month, compared with $54
million in April, exchange data show. The  Taiex (TWSE)  index rose to
its highest since August 2011, before closing up 1.3 percent at
8,267.09. The local dollar has limited room to climb as  exchange
rate  gains may threaten exports, Cathay Financial Holding Co.
analysts wrote in a research note today.  Shipments (TWTREXPY)  dropped 1.9
percent in April, after a 3.3 percent increase in March,
official data showed yesterday.  “There continues to be a lot of money coming in to buy
stocks,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at  Union Bank of
Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “The stock rally will probably be tested at
8,500, and that’s when we’ll see Taiwan dollar gains slowing.
Taiwan’s exporters can’t stand a strong currency.”  The  Taiwan dollar  advanced 0.3 percent to NT$29.5 against
its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The
currency earlier touched NT$29.38, the strongest level since
Jan. 28.  The local dollar was trading 0.7 percent stronger two
minutes before the 4 p.m. close. The central bank has sold the
currency in the run-up to the close on most days in the past
year, according to traders who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.5 percent to
NT$29.360 against the greenback, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, rose one basis
point to 3.48 percent.  Government bonds  fell. The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds
due January 2018 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 0.892 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market prices.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.386
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
