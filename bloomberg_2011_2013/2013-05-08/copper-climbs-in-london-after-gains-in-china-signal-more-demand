Copper rose in  London  after a report
on growing exports and imports from  China  signaled increased
demand for the metal from the world’s biggest buyer.  China’s exports rose 14.7 percent last month from a year
ago and imports climbed 16.8 percent, data from the General
Administration of Customs showed today. The nation accounts for
more than 40 percent of global copper consumption. Prices jumped
6.2 percent on May 3 afte U.S. payrolls climbed.  “The U.S. recovery and improving Chinese international
trade figures are supporting the copper price,” Pengjiang
“Richard” Fu, director for Asian commodities trading
at Newedge Group SA in London, said by e-mail today. “China’s
data this month on  money supply , inflation and new loans will be
key to keeping the rally going.”  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose 0.9 percent to $7,333.25 a metric ton by 9:01 a.m.
in London. Copper for July delivery increased 0.8 percent to

China were 295,799 tons last month, customs data showed today.
That was the lowest since June 2011, and was down 7.4 percent

term,  Max Layton , an analyst at the bank, said in a report dated
yesterday, citing declines in inventories and an anticipated
improvement in sentiment on Chinese demand. The bank kept its
