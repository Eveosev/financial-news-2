A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
increased after reaching its lowest level in five years.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, rose 0.5
basis point to a mid-price of 69.5 basis points at 8 a.m. in  New
York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The increase marks the measure’s first  ascent  in five days,
Bloomberg prices show. Three-month implied volatility of the
investment-grade gauge increased by 4 percent this week,
according to a note today from JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led
by  Eric Beinstein , who wrote “this looks more reasonable to us,
as tail risks in  Europe  or in the U.S. are still present.”  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
