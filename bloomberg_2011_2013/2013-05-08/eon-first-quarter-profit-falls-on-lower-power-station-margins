EON SE,  Germany ’s biggest utility,
reported a 16 percent drop in profit in the first quarter
because of divestments, lower output and narrower margins in
power generation from fossil fuels.  Underlying net income, the profit measure EON uses to
calculate its dividend, fell to 1.39 billion euros ($1.82
billion) from 1.66 billion euros a year earlier, the Dusseldorf-
based company said today in a statement. That beat the 1.3
billion euro average  estimate  of seven analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales gained 0.4 percent to 35.9 billion euros.  European utilities are contending with weaker demand and a
slower economic outlook ahead of Germany’s planned exit from
nuclear energy by 2022. EON, which scrapped previous profit
forecasts for 2013, plans to reduce capital spending and is
selling assets to cut costs. The utility, which is focusing on
expansion abroad, is also studying whether to close unprofitable
power plants at home.  EON confirmed its outlook of an underlying net income of
2.2 billion euros to 2.6 billion euros for this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
