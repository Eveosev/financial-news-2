Oil traders boosted the number of
tankers they booked to ship European gasoline to the U.S. in the
past week, according to a survey of shipbrokers.  They already hired or plan to hire 33 Medium Range tankers
on the industry’s benchmark Rotterdam-to-New York trade route
for loading in the next two weeks, according to a survey of four
shipbrokers and one trader yesterday and today. That compares
with 21 charters in the corresponding survey on April 30.  U.S. gasoline imports averaged 591,000 barrels a day so far
in 2013, the lowest for the time of year in at least a decade,
Energy Department data show. Inventories are 215 million
barrels, the highest for the time of year since 2010.  Of the 33 charters, 22 have been completed and 11 are
anticipated, according to the respondents. Ship bookings often
contain clauses allowing vessels to sail to different ports.
There are 39 tankers available for the trade, compared with 33
in the April 30 survey. Each vessel would normally carry about
38,000 metric tons of cargo.  Hire costs on the trade route jumped 14 percent to 167.92
Worldscale points, according to figures from the  Baltic Exchange 
in  London . Earnings for the vessels surged 33 percent to $19,410
a day, according to the bourse’s calculations.  *T                             May 7/8     April 30
