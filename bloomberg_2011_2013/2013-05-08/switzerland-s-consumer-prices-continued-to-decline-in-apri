Swiss  consumer prices  extended their
longest slump in at least four decades in April.  Prices decreased 0.6 percent from a year earlier after
dropping 0.6 percent in March, the  Federal Statistics Office  in
Neuchatel said in an e-mailed statement today. Prices were
unchanged in the month. Economists expected an annual decline of
0.5 percent and a monthly increase of 0.1 percent, according to
a Bloomberg News survey.  The  Swiss National Bank  imposed a franc ceiling of 1.20
versus the euro in September 2011 to fight deflation threats.
Even so, consumer prices have continued to drop and are now in
their 19th straight month of annual declines, the longest
stretch since at least 1971, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The SNB, headed by President Thomas Jordan, forecast
consumer prices will fall 0.2 percent in 2013, before rising 0.2
percent in 2014 and 0.7 percent in 2015.  The cost of Swiss imported  consumer goods  declined 2.8
percent from a year earlier and were unchanged from March,
today’s report showed. Prices of domestic goods climbed 0.1
percent on the year and were unchanged on the month.  Under a European Union harmonized method, Swiss consumer
prices fell 0.4 percent from a year earlier and 0.1 percent on a
monthly basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
