German government bonds pared an
advance after a report showed the nationâ€™s industrial production
unexpectedly rose in March.  German 10-year yields were little changed at 1.29 percent
as of 11:03 a.m. London time after dropping as much as two basis
points before the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
