SSE Plc (SSE) , the U.K.â€™s second-biggest
energy supplier, plans to build a 30 million-pound ($46.5
million) hydropower plant in Ross-shire, northern  Scotland , that
will provide enough electricity for about 10,000 homes.  The utility will begin building the 7.5-megawatt facility
in the second half and the plant will start working toward the
end of 2015, SSE said today in  a statement  on its website.  Hydro developers in Scotland, which wants all its
electricity to come from clean sources by 2020 from about 39
percent now, qualify for so-called Renewable Obligation
Certificate incentives. These amount to about 44 pounds a
megawatt-hour at  current prices .  To contact the reporter on this story:
