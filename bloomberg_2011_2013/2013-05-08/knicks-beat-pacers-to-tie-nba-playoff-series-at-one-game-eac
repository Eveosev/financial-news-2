The  New York Knicks  beat the Indiana
Pacers 105-79 to level their National Basketball Association
playoff series at one game apiece.  A Carmelo Anthony layup tied the game a 64-64 with two
minutes, 25 seconds to play in the third and triggered a 30-2
scoring run that gave  New York  control at 92-66 with five
minutes left in the fourth quarter. Anthony scored 22 of his 32
points in the second half and also had nine rebounds.  After two meetings at Madison Square Garden in New York,
the best-of-seven Eastern Conference series moves to
Indianapolis for games on May 11 and 14. The series winner will
face the Chicago Bulls or Miami Heat for a place in the NBA
Finals. Chicago leads that series 1-0.  Also tonight in the Western Conference, the Oklahoma City
Thunder host the  Memphis Grizzlies  in Game 2 of their second-
round series. The Thunder won the opening game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
