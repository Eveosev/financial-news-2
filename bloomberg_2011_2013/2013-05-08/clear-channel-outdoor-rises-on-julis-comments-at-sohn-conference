Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. (CCO) 
rose after Canyon Partners LLC’s Mitchell Julis said the
operator of more than 750,000 advertising displays rewards
shareholders as it layers on debt.  Clear Channel Outdoor  increased  4.8 percent to $7.59 at the
close in  New York , after climbing as high as $7.80. Shares have
risen 8.1 percent this year.  The unit of  Clear Channel Communications Inc. (CCMO) , which has
about $20 billion of debt, is structured in a way that stock
investors benefit from increased leverage, Julis, co-founder of
the $22 billion hedge fund based in  Los Angeles , said today at
the Ira Sohn conference in New York.  “Every time they lever it up, they have to declare a
dividend,” said Julis, whose Canyon  owned  more than 10 percent
of the unit as of January. “So that means you get your money
back.”  Clear Channel Communications, which owns and operates more
than 850 broadcast radio stations, has about $10 billion of debt
maturing in 2016, including $8.2 billion in term loan portions
it’s seeking to extend, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  If the company added $700 million of debt, shareholders
would receive another $2 a share, Julis said.  Shira Mahler, a spokeswoman for Clear Channel, didn’t
immediately return an e-mail seeking comment.  Clear Channel Outdoor agreed April 3 to declare a $200
million dividend to settle a shareholder lawsuit that challenged
a $1 billion loan after an investor sued, contending its
directors wrongfully approved an unsecured loan and transferred
more than $600 million to the parent owned by private-equity
funds Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP.  Clear Channel Worldwide’s $1.9 billion of 7.625 percent
senior subordinated bonds due March 2020 traded at 110 cents on
the dollar to yield 5.829 percent as of 9:56 a.m., according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Julis founded Canyon in 1990 with Joshua Friedman, whom he
met at  Harvard University , and they worked for  Michael Milken  at
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in the 1980s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
