The Treasury’s $24 billion sale of  10-
year (USGG10YR)  notes may draw a yield of 1.794 percent, according to the
average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 of the Federal
Reserve’s 21 primary dealers.  The notes, which mature in May 2023, yielded 1.80 percent
in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York time.
The record-low  sale yield , 1.459 percent, was reached at the
July 11 offering.  The April 10 auction’s  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.79, versus an average of 2.92 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 37.3 percent of the notes at last
month’s offering, compared with an average of 36.4 percent at
the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 29.1 percent of
the offering in April and an average of 24 percent at the past
10 auctions.  Ten-year U.S. debt has returned 0.5 percent this year, more
than the 0.3 percent gain in the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
benchmark notes returned 4.2 percent in 2012, compared with a
2.2 percent gain by Treasuries overall.  This is the second of three auctions this week as the
government  sells  $72 billion of notes and bonds. It auctioned
$32 billion of three-year securities yesterday and is due to
sell $16 billion of 30-year debt tomorrow.  The sales will raise $12.4 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.6 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Primary dealers trade government securities with the
central bank and are obliged to participate in U.S. debt sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
