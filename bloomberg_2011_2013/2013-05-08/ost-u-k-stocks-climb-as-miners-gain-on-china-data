U.K. stocks  climbed, extending the the
highest level for the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index in more than five years, as
companies from  Next Plc (NXT)  to Sage Group Plc reported results.  Next rallied 4.4 percent to the highest since at least 1988
after Britain’s second-largest clothing retailer posted sales
that beat analyst estimates. Sage Group Plc gained 2.3 percent
as the software maker said it on track to meet its full-year
expectations.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  led declining shares,
falling 4.4 percent, after reporting lower profit.  The FTSE 100 added 26.18 points, or 0.4 percent, to
6,583.48 at the close in  London , its highest level since
November 2007, as optimism grew central banks will maintain
monetary support to drive economic growth. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also increased 0.4 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index lost 0.8 percent.  “The market can continue to go higher until such time as
central-bank stimulus is removed,” Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head
of research at Charles Stanley Group Plc in London, said in a
telephone interview. “Macro economic data is of lesser
significance” than the  Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy, he
said.  The  Bank of England  is forecast to leave its stimulus
program on hold tomorrow amid signs the economic recovery has
found a firmer footing. A Bloomberg News survey of economists
shows policy makers will refrain from expanding the bank’s
quantitative easing beyond 375 billion pounds ($582 billion).  Next Sales  Next advanced 4.4 percent to 4,601 pence, its highest price
since at least September 1988. The retailer said Next brand
sales rose 2.2 percent in the 14 weeks ended May 4. That
compared with the 1.1 percent median estimate of 11 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg, and growth of 3.9 percent in the previous
quarter. Directory catalog and online sales increased 8.9
percent, while retail sales fell 1.9 percent.  Sage Group gained 2.3 percent to 347 pence after the
software maker reported a 5 percent increase in first-half
revenue to 708.1 million pounds ($1.1 billion) and said it is
confident it will deliver on strategic and financial goals for
the year. The company also proposed a 3.69 pence interim
dividend.  Melrose Industries Plc (MRO)  rallied 2.7 percent to 251.8 pence
after the engineering company said it was confident of meeting
 full-year targets  with trading so far this year in line with
expectations. The company also said results at its Elster energy
business, which it acquired in 2012, were “significantly
ahead” of the same period last year.  Evraz Rating  Evraz Plc (EVR)  jumped 3.1 percent to 171.4 pence. Barclays Plc
raised its recommendation for the mining company to equal weight
from underweight, meaning investors should buy shares to the
equal the company’s weighting in benchmark indexes.  Standard Chartered  dropped 4.4 percent to 1,625 pence, for
the biggest decline on the FTSE 100. The U.K.’s second-largest
bank by market value said operating profit in the first quarter
declined as wholesale banking revenue fell. The stock had
climbed 5.1 percent in the previous four days.  CRH Plc (CRH)  lost 3.6 percent to 1,384 pence in London after the
Dublin-based company said cold weather and a challenging
economic environment had a “significant impact” on
construction in its major markets. Like-for-like sales fell 12
percent in the period from January to April from a year earlier.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  dropped 3.9 percent to 381 pence after the
U.K.’s third-largest supermarket company predicted a slowdown in
sales growth after a year of outpacing its main competitors.  A stagnant economy and a smaller contribution from store
extensions will limit same-store revenue growth to between 1
percent and 1.5 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2014,
the company said today. That compares with last year’s 1.8
percent gain on a basis that excludes gasoline.  InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG)  fell 2.5 percent to 1,912
pence even as the world’s largest provider of hotel
accommodation increased first-quarter revenue per room by 3.1
percent from a year earlier. The stock has still climbed 10
percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
