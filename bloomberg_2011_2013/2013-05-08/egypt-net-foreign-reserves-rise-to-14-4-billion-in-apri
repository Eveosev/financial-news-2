Egypt’s net international reserves
rose in April to $14.4 billion, in the first increase since
October.  Reserves grew from $13.4 billion in March, according to
central bank data released on its website today. Still, reserves
are 60 percent lower than the levels recorded at the end of
2010, before the uprising that ousted longtime leader  Hosni Mubarak  and ushered in turmoil that has deterred foreign
investors and tourists.  The increase reflects an injection of Libyan funds, “which
provides short-term financing but we need to see an improvement
in the fundamentals of the balance of payments, which is still
under performing,” Mohamed Abu Basha, an economist at
investment bank EFG Hermes Holding SAE, said by phone.  Last month, Libyan Central Bank Governor Sadiq Al-Kabir
said his country deposited $2 billion with the Central Bank of
Egypt to boost the Egyptian economy and help stem flow of
migrant workers from its eastern neighbor, the Libyan state-run
LANA news agency reported at the time.  Economists including Abu Basha, say such injections cannot
replace a deal that  Egypt  is trying to secure for a $4.8 billion
International Monetary Fund loan. Egyptian officials say
concluding the long-delayed IMF accord is necessary to lure back
investors and unlock other funds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
