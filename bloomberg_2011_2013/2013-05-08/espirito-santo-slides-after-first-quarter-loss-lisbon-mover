Banco Espirito Santo SA fell the most
in 17 months after  Portugal ’s biggest publicly traded lender
posted an unexpected first-quarter loss and its chief executive
officer said he can’t guarantee positive results for this year.  Espirito Santo slumped 10.6 percent to close at 82.5 euro
cents, the biggest drop since Dec. 2011, giving the bank a
market value of 3.31 billion euros ($4.4 billion).  The bank posted a first-quarter loss of 62 million euros on
rising loan-loss provisions after the close of trading
yesterday. That missed the 1.6 million-euro profit analysts had
predicted, based on the median estimate of three surveyed by
Bloomberg. The Lisbon-based bank “can’t guarantee” it will end
the year with positive results, Chief Executive Officer Ricardo Salgado told reporters at a press conference yesterday.  “It’s natural that Salgado’s comments may fuel concern
among investors, increasing the selling pressure,” said Diana Gomes, a trader at Orey iTrade, a brokerage in Lisbon.  Antonio Ramirez , an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.
also downgraded the lender to “underperform” from “market
perform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
