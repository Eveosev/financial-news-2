Grupo BTG Pactual SA, Brazil’s second-
biggest equity underwriter, fell as much as 3.3 percent in  Sao
Paulo  after the bank reported a bigger profit decline than
analysts estimated.  The shares  dropped  1.9 percent to 33.33 reais at 11:37
a.m., after falling to 32.88 reais earlier today, the biggest
intraday drop in two weeks. The benchmark Ibovespa index gained
0.4 percent.  BTG’s adjusted net income slid 22 percent to 611.6 million
reais ($305.5 million), or 68 centavos a unit, from 786 million
reais, or 98 centavos, a year earlier, according to a regulatory
filing yesterday from the Sao Paulo-based company. The average
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 86
centavos.  The results marked the first time return on average equity,
a gauge of profitability, dropped below 20 percent since the
bank’s initial public offering a year ago, “which could lead to
some stock price pressure in the short term,” Deutsche Bank AG
analysts including  Mario Pierry  wrote in a note to clients
today.  BTG’s annualized return on  shareholders’ equity  fell to
16.9 percent in the first quarter from 35.2 percent a year
earlier. Chief Executive Officer  Andre Esteves , 44, said in
February that the bank can continue to deliver ROE above 20
percent.  The company spent 419.1 million reais on income taxes in
the first quarter, or 47 percent more than a year earlier,
according to the filing. The effective income  tax rate  climbed
to 41 percent in the first quarter from 27 percent in the same
period last year.  The bank said the effective tax rate increased as the
earnings contribution from private-equity division BTG
Investments declined and its real estate unit, BR Properties,
had a loss. The two divisions aren’t subject to the income tax.  The firm and its shareholders raised 3.66 billion reais in
an IPO in April 2012, the first time a standalone investment
bank in  Brazil  listed itself on a stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
