  Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE) , the
explorer seeking oil in the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  and West Africa,
fell the most in more than four months after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and other backers sold 50 million shares at a discount to
yesterday’s closing price.  Cobalt, based in Houston,  fell  6.8 percent to $26.83 at
10:54 a.m. in New York. The shares earlier dropped 7.6 percent,
the biggest intraday decline since Dec. 12.  Affiliates of Goldman, First Reserve Corp., Riverstone
Holdings LLC,  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  and KERN Partners Ltd. sold 50
million shares at $26.80, Cobalt said today in a statement
today, a 6.9 percent discount from yesterday’s closing price.
The offering dropped their combined stakes to 30.5 percent from
43 percent, according to a filing.  Carlyle, Goldman and other backers first sold shares of
Cobalt to the public in December 2009 for $13.50, below their
expectations of $15 to $17. Combined stakes by the backers
dropped below 50 percent after they sold 40 million shares in
January.  Citigroup Inc. handled the sale and has the option to buy
7.5 million shares from the selling stockholders at the offer
price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
