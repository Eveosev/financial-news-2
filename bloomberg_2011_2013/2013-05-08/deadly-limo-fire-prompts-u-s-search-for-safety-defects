U.S. auto-safety regulators are
looking into whether a limousine involved in a deadly fire in
 California  had any safety defects that would require them to
act, a spokeswoman for the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said.  “The agency is in contact with the local authorities who
are investigating to determine if there are vehicle safety
implications that merit agency action,” Karen Aldana, an agency
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “At this time, NHTSA has no
basis for speculating that there have been any violations.”  The May 4 fire on the San Mateo Bridge in California’s San
Francisco Bay area killed five women who were trapped in the
limousine when it caught fire. Agencies of the U.S.
Transportation Department regulate vehicle safety and interstate
commercial transportation, while states regulate intrastate
commercial transport.  Limousines can be original equipment or manufactured from
incomplete vehicles. The vehicle that caught on fire in
California was a 1999 Ford Motor Co. Lincoln Town Car, according
to the Los Angeles Times. The California Highway Patrol, which
is investigating the incident, didn’t immediately respond to a
phone message left before regular business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
