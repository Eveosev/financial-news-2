Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , Canada’s
third-largest insurer, will seek sales growth in Asian markets
to help counter stagnant interest rates, Chief Executive Officer
Dean Connor said.  “Malaysia offers excellent opportunities for long-term
growth with a fast growing economy and middle class,” Connor
said today at the company’s annual meeting in Toronto.
“Vietnam’s life insurance market is in its infancy, but with 90
million people and a fast growing economy, we see it as a long-term growth engine.”  Sales at Sun Life’s joint venture in Vietnam with PVI
Holdings should begin in the next few months, Connor said. The
Toronto-based firm announced a deal in January with Khazanah
Nasional Bhd to buy 98 percent of  Aviva Plc (AV/) ’s and  CIMB Group
Holdings Bhd (CIMB) ’s Malaysian insurance joint venture for 1.8 billion
Malaysian ringgit ($608 million).  The Canadian benchmark overnight rate, which has been 1
percent since September 2010, won’t rise until the third quarter
of 2014, according to a forecast of 18 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
