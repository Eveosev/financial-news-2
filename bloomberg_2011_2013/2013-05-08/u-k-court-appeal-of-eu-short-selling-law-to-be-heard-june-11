A U.K. challenge to overturn parts of
a short-selling law that would allow bans on naked credit-
default swaps tied to sovereign debt will be heard by the
European Union’s top court on June 11.  The EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg added the hearing
date to its updated diary today. The U.K. last year  appealed  the
new law, seeking to overturn parts it argues may give an EU
regulator too big a mandate.  The  European Securities and Markets Authority , which
coordinates the work of national regulators in the 27-nation
bloc, would get powers under the law that go beyond what is
allowed by the EU’s treaties, according to the U.K.  Among its arguments, Britain has said ESMA has “a large
measure of discretion” about when it takes action, is “given a
wide range of choices as to what measure or measures to impose”
and “is empowered to renew its measures without any limit on
their overall duration.”  The case is: C-270/12, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland v. Council of the European Union, European
Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
