John Tomic, the coach and father of
top-ranked Australian tennis player  Bernard Tomic , was barred
from men’s tour events until further notice as he faces a charge
of assaulting his son’s training partner.  John Tomic was charged with assault two days after
allegedly injuring Thomas Drouet with a head butt on May 4 in a
 Madrid  street. He has disputed the charge and a hearing was
postponed to May 14, according to a statement released by a
spokesman for Madrid’s criminal court.  “Following last week’s incident in Madrid concerning John
Tomic, and the ensuing investigation, Mr. Tomic’s credential
privileges have been suspended at all ATP tournaments until
further notice,” the ATP said in an e-mailed statement. “The
ATP’s investigation into this incident remains on-going.”  Frenchman Drouet, who sustained a broken nose in the
incident, was cited by French sports newspaper L’Equipe
yesterday as saying the elder Tomic was a “ dangerous person ”
who should be banned from all tour events.  Tennis Australia , the sport’s national governing body, said
today it’s working with the ATP to “ascertain the full facts of
the incident while providing assistance and support to Bernard
Tomic during this difficult time.”  The elder Tomic is a former  taxi driver  who is now coach of
his 20-year-old son, according to the ATP website.  Bernard Tomic, who broke through for his first ATP title at
January’s Sydney International, is ranked No. 53 on the ATP
World Tour. He lost 6-3, 6-2 to  Radek Stepanek  in the first
round of the Madrid Masters clay-court event three days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
