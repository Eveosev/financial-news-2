Todd Newman , the former Diamondback
Capital Management LLC portfolio manager convicted of taking
part in a $72 million insider-trading scheme, must surrender to
prison authorities July 8, a judge ruled.  Newman, 48, was sentenced on May 2 in Manhattan federal
court to 4 1/2 years in prison. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan also ordered Newman to pay a $4 million fine, the
proceeds his hedge fund made from trades on illicit tips in  Dell
Inc. (DELL)  and  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)  Newman asked that he be allowed to remain
free while he appealed his conviction.  Sullivan said in a ruling filed yesterday that while both
prosecutors and defense lawyers agree Newman isn’t a flight
risk, the court wasn’t convinced the defendant had raised a
“substantial question of law or fact” likely to affect the
outcome of the case.  Because of that, “the court need not consider whether the
issue defendant raises on appeal is likely to result in a
reversal of his conviction or a new trial,” Sullivan wrote.
“Accordingly, defendant’s application for bail pending appeal
is hereby denied.”  John Nathanson, a lawyer for Newman, couldn’t be
immediately reached for comment on the decision.  The case is U.S. v. Newman, 1:12-cr-00121, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
