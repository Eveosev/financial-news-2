Treasury 10-year note yields reached
the highest level in almost four weeks before the U.S. sells $24
billion of the securities today.  The  benchmark note  pared losses as Treasury prepared to
hold the second of three debt sales this week totaling $72
billion. A $32 billion auction of three-year notes yesterday
drew  bids  for 3.38 times the amount offered, compared with an
average of 3.57 for the past 10 sales. Yields jumped on May 3 as
a U.S. Labor Department report showed employers hired more
workers in April than economists predicted.  “Bonds are finding a level where there’s interest,” said
 Brian Edmonds , head of  interest rates  at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in
 New York , one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“The market traded off hard in the last couple of days on the
employment numbers on Friday. The auction should go well today.
There will be plenty of people bidding.”  The U.S.  10-year yield  fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.75 percent at 12:43 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2
percent note due in February 2023 rose 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000
face value, to 102 6/32. The yield reached the highest level
since April 11.  The benchmark yield has increased from this year’s low of
1.61 percent set last week after a report showed the
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to a four-year low of 7.5
percent.  Yield Spread  The difference between yields on 10- and 30-year debt
widened to 1.22 percentage points, the most since April 5 and
above the one-year average of 1.17 percentage points.
Historically, a so-called steeper yield curve reflects
diminishing demand from investors anticipating faster economic
growth and inflation.  “The 10-year Treasury still offers a diversification
benefit that few other assets enjoy,” William Irving, a
Merrimack, New Hampshire-based money manager at  Fidelity
Investments , which oversees $1.6 trillion, said in an interview
with  Tom Keene  on  Bloomberg Radio . “Even though the yield is
low, they still offer the possibility of going up in price when
there is a flight to quality.”  The 10-year securities being auctioned today yielded 1.82
percent in pre-auction trading. The notes were sold at 1.795
percent last month, compared with a record-low auction yield of
1.459 percent set on July 11.  Reduced Bids  The previous 10-year auction on April 10 attracted  bids  for
2.79 times the amount of debt available, compared with 3.19
times on March 13.  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$753 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $3.02 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, according to data released by the Treasury and
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’re at levels that are justified, given where the
economy is at,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New
York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “We had a month-and-
a-half rally that people thought was the beginning of a new
economic decline. We’re going to see better data and slightly
higher yields.”  The government is scheduled to conclude this week’s
auctions with a $16 billion sale of 30-year debt tomorrow.  The Fed bought $3.6 billion of Treasuries maturing between
February 2019 and April 2020 today, according to the Fed Bank of
New York’s  website . The central bank is buying $85 billion of
Treasury and mortgage debt each month to support the economy by
putting downward pressure on borrowing costs.  U.S. 10-year notes have returned 0.5 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Three-year securities gained 0.2 percent, while 30-year bonds
lost 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
