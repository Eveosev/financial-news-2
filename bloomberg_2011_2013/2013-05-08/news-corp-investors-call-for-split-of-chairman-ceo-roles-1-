News Corp. (NWSA)  investors Christian Bros.
Investment Services and British Columbia Investment Management
Corp. filed a joint shareholder proposal calling for an
independent chairman at Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.  The joint resolution is supported by the Local Authority
Pension Fund Forum in the U.K., the investors said today in a
statement. Christian Bros. and the British Columbia fund also
said they support a proposal from the Nathan Cummings Foundation
seeking to eliminate the dual-class share structure that gives
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Murdoch’s family control of
the New York-based media company.  At last year’s shareholder meeting, a resolution to split
the chairman and CEO  roles  at News Corp. was supported by two-thirds of independent shareholders and elimination of the dual-class stock garnered 62 percent of outsiders’ votes.  Since then, News Corp. has announced plans to split into
two companies. The one focused on publishing will retain the
News Corp. name and the other, to be called 21st Century Fox,
will hold entertainment assets. Murdoch will be chairman of both
companies and CEO of the entertainment business.  News Corp., which reports results today, fell 1 percent to
$31.86 at the close in  New York . The Class A shares have 
advanced  25 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
