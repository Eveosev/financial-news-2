Parkland Fuel Corp. (PKI) , Canada’s largest
independent fuel distributor, surged the most in 18 months after
reporting first-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
expectations.  Parkland  jumped  as much as 8.2 percent to C$17.64, the most
intraday since October 2011, and was up 6.3 percent to C$17.33
at 10:59 a.m. in Toronto. Shares in the Red Deer, Alberta-based
company declined 14 percent this year through yesterday.  First-quarter  net income  rose to 42 Canadian cents a share
from 26 cents a year earlier while sales jumped 14 percent to
C$1.21 billion, aided by Parkland’s purchase of Elbow River
Marketing from AvenEx Energy Corp. in December. The acquisition
helped boost volumes 29 percent to 314.6 million liters, the
company said in a statement. Elbow River runs a fleet of 1,200
leased rail cars throughout  Canada  and the U.S.  “The magnitude of the beat this quarter, in addition to
Elbow’s strong start, provides comfort,” Trevor Johnson, a
Toronto-based analyst at National Bank Financial, said in a note
to clients upgrading the stock to the equivalent of a  buy  from
hold while maintaining a C$19 price target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
