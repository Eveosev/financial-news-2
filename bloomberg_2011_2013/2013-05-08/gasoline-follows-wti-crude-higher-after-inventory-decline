Gasoline rose, following West Texas
Intermediate crude higher, after an industry report yesterday
that oil inventories at the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma,
declined last week.  Futures gained as much as 0.6 percent. WTI rose 0.8 percent
and its discount to  Brent crude  on ICE Futures Europe narrowed
to $8.29 a barrel, the lowest level since January 2012.
Gasoline’s crack spread versus WTI narrowed 11 cents to $23.27 a
barrel, and the fuel’s premium over Brent widened 40 cents to
$14.  “It’s following WTI and waiting for the big report today
to see if there’s any indication of demand,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gasoline for June delivery rose 1.28 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $2.8462 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange on
trading volume that was 24 percent below the 100-day average at
10:17 a.m.  The Energy Information Administration is scheduled to
report weekly inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in Washington. The
EIA will probably report that distillate inventories rose
500,000 barrels and gasoline supplies declined 475,000 barrels,
according to the median estimate of 12 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg.  The  American Petroleum Institute  reported yesterday that
gasoline stockpiles fell 186,000 barrels and distillate
stockpiles increased 1.1 million.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for June delivery rose 0.21 cent to
$2.9298 a gallon on Nymex on trading volume that was 0.5 percent
below the 100-day average for the time of day.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
shrank 60 cents to $26.74 a barrel. The premium over Brent
dropped 11 cents to $18.45.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 1.4 cents
to $3.539 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices are
22.4 cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
