Prime Minister  David Cameron  announced
a bill to force anyone operating a gambling company in the U.K.,
whether based there or overseas, to hold a British license and
inform regulators of suspicious patterns of wagers in a bid to
tackle problem gaming.  Only remote gambling operators in the U.K. are currently
required to hold a Gambling Commission license, while overseas
operators are regulated in the jurisdiction in which they are
based. The bill, announced today by Queen Elizabeth II at the
state opening of Parliament in London, will regulate gaming at
the point of consumption.  Under the measures, all operators selling or advertising in
the British market will be required to hold a U.K. Gambling
Commission license, the government said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
