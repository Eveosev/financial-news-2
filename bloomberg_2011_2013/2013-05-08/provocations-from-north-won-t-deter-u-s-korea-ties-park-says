The U.S. and  South Korea  should deepen
economic ties as  North Korea  threatens global security with
bellicose rhetoric, South Korean President Park Geun Hye said.  “Korea is firmly committed to free trade, to economic
openness, for creativity can never thrive in a closed economy,”
Park said today at a luncheon sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce in  Washington . “We will make the Korea-U.S. alliance
even stronger.”  South Korea, the seventh-largest U.S. trading partner, and
the U.S. last year put into effect a free-trade agreement aimed
at cutting about 80 percent of tariffs between the two nations.
The U.S. and South Korea have been in a standoff with North
Korea since February after the government in Pyongyang tested a
nuclear weapon in defiance of United Nations sanctions and then
threatened atomic strikes.  “No North Korean provocation can succeed,” Park said.  The U.S. exported $42.3 billion in merchandise including
electronic products, chemicals and vehicles to South Korea in
2012. The  U.S. trade deficit  with the Asian nation increased 25
percent, to $16.6 billion, last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
