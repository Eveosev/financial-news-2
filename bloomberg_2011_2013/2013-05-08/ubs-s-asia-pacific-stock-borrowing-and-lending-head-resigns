Dan Sofianos, Asia-Pacific stock
borrowing and lending head at  UBS AG (UBSN) , has resigned after 19
years with the largest Swiss bank.  Mark Panday, a spokesman for the Zurich-based bank in  Hong
Kong , confirmed his resignation and that of Ross Hunt, a
director on the team.  Sofianos relocated from London to Hong Kong in July 2010 to
take the stock-loan job, according to an internal memo seen by
Bloomberg at the time.  He joined UBS in 1994 and was a senior equity-finance sales
trader in the prime-brokerage business before the 2010
promotion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
