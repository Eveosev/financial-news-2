U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said European governments need to achieve the “right balance”
between economic growth and  deficit reduction .  European officials have focused too much on cutting
deficits at the expense of economic growth, Lew said, according
to a transcript of an interview with PBS NewsHour scheduled for
broadcast today.  “They need to get the right balance between growth and
austerity,” Lew said. “They focus too quickly on deficit
reduction and not enough on getting their economy moving.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
