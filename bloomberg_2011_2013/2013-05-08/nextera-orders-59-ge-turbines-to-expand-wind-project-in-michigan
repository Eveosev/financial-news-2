NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , the largest U.S.
wind-power operator, ordered 59 wind turbines from General
Electric Co. to expand a project in Michigan.  The turbines will be installed at NextEra’s 100.3-megawatt
Tuscola II project in Tuscola County, Steve Stengel, a spokesman
for the Juno Beach, Florida-based company, said today by e-mail.  Construction is expected to be complete by the end of the
year and utility  DTE Energy Co. (DTE)  has agreed to purchase the
electricity for 20 years, Stengel said. Tuscola I, the 120-megawatt first phase of the wind farm, began delivering power in
December.  The order is the first for GE’s 1.7-megawatt turbines with
100-meter blades (328 feet), about the height of a 33-story
building, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based manufacturer said
today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
