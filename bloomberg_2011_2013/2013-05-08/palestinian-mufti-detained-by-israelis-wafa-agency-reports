Israeli police detained the top
Palestinian Muslim cleric for questioning today, then released
him without charge amid denunciations by the Palestinians and
the Jordanian parliament.  Police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said Muhammad Hussain was
detained on suspicion of incitement after disturbances yesterday
at a holy site in  Jerusalem ’s Old City. Chairs were thrown from
the site at a visiting Jewish group and Hussain was “suspected
of involvement,” Rosenfeld said by phone.  Hussain, who carries the title of mufti of Jerusalem, was
released without charge after six hours of questioning,
Rosenfeld said.  Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called for
the mufti’s immediate release in a text message to journalists
from the official Wafa news agency. Jordan’s parliament called
for the expulsion of Israel’s envoy and the recall of the
Jordanian ambassador to the Jewish state, the official Petra
news agency reported.  The shrine, known to Jews as Temple Mount and to Muslims as
Haram al-Sharif, houses two major Muslim mosques and is holy to
Jews as the site of their ancient temples. It is located in the
eastern sector of the city that  Israel  captured in 1967 and the
Palestinians claim for a future capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
