Iron ore imports  by  China , the world’s
biggest buyer, climbed to the highest in four months in April as
greater steel production boosted demand.  Imports totaled 67.2 million metric tons in April, China’s
General Administration of Customs said today on its  website .
Shipments, the highest since December, were 64.6 million tons in
March and 57.7 million tons in April last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s  steel output  climbed 7.7 percent to a record 66.3
million tons in March, according to data from the National
Bureau of Statistics. Production probably stayed above 63
million tons last month as steel prices and raw material prices
dropped, sustaining iron ore demand, said Xu Xiangchun, an
analyst at researcher Mysteel.com.  Ore with 62 percent iron content  delivered to China’s
Tianjin port added 1.5 percent to $130 a dry ton yesterday, the
first increase since April 12, according to data from the Steel
Index Ltd. Prices have dropped 18 percent from a 16-month high
of $158.90 reached on Feb. 20.  China’s iron ore imports were 250 million tons in the first
four months of this year, the General Administration of Customs
said.  Steel-product exports  were 5.55 million tons in April,
customs said. Shipments rose 19 percent to 20 million tons for
the first two months.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
