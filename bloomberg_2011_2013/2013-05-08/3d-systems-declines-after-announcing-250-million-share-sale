3D Systems Corp. (DDD) , a maker of three-dimensional printers, fell the most in 2 1/2 months after
announcing the sale of about $250 million of its stock, plus an
additional 1.3 million shares by company officers and directors.  3D Systems’s stock declined 4.7 percent to $40.64 at 12:12
p.m. in New York, and earlier touched $39.55 for the biggest
intraday drop since Feb. 25. Through yesterday, the stock had
climbed 20 percent so far this year, compared with a 14 percent
gain in the Standard & Poor’s Smallcap 600 Index.  3D Systems, whose printers build objects out of computer-based designs, plans to sell about $250 million worth of its own
shares to “finance future acquisitions of other entities or
their assets,” the company said in a statement after
yesterday’s close in New York. Some of the Rock Hill, South
Carolina-based company’s officers and directors will also sell
their holdings, totaling about 1.3 million shares, as part of
the offering.  “The size of the offering, in our view, suggests 3D
Systems has its sights set on a relatively large target
company,” Brian Drab, an analyst at William Blair & Co., wrote
in a research note.  Arcam AB (ARCM)  is the most likely target, according to Drab.
Based in Molndal,  Sweden , Arcam has a market value of about $156
million.  3D Systems, which said its proceeds from the offering will
also be used for working capital and general purposes, said
today it plans to price the share sale after the close of
trading in New York on May 9.  Needham & Co., Canaccord Genuity Inc. and Piper Jaffray &
Co. will manage the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
