The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 1.5 basis
points to 96.25 basis points as of 10:24 a.m. in Sydney,
according to Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The measure is down
9.7 basis points this month and is trading at levels last seen
in November 2010, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1 basis point to 100 as of 8:16
a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac prices show. The benchmark, which has
ranged from 99.9 basis points to 122.3 basis points this year,
has has fallen 7.5 basis points in May, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 2 basis points to 77
basis points as of 9:26 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. The gauge is on track for its lowest close since
May 21, 2008, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
