African Bank Investments Ltd. (ABL) , the
largest provider of unsecured loans in  South Africa , is still
considering the dollar bond issue it delayed earlier this year,
said Executive Director Tami Sokutu.  “There is still an appetite within the country,” Sokutu
said in an interview at the  World Economic Forum  on  Africa  in
 Cape Town  today. “We have no reason to change our strategy.”  African Bank shelved the bond sale in February after the
National Credit Regulator requested that a tribunal impose a
fine after finding that loan agents at one of the lender’s
branches colluded with customers to lower lending standards in
exchange for cash. The bank won’t sell a dollar bond “at all
costs,” Sokutu said today.  African Bank plans to visit international investors after
the Johannesburg-based lender announced last week that earnings
per share in the six months through March dropped by as much as
28 percent. That sent the stock tumbling to its worst three-day
decline in 13 years.  African Bank rose as much as 12 percent, the biggest
intraday gain in four years, in Johannesburg trading and was up
7.7 percent to 23 rand as of 5:05 p.m.  “Last week’s announcement and the perceptions around
unsecured lending could raise the cost of funding,” said
Sokutu. The lender said the South African economy and rising
consumer prices are affecting customer’s ability to repay loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
