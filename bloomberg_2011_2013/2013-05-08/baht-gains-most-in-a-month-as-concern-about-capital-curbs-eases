Thailand ’s baht rose the most in a
month amid easing concern policy makers will curb capital
inflows that drove the currency to a 16-year high last month.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said yesterday that
the baht is now more stable, adding he prefers an interest-rate
cut as an “easy measure” to temper exchange-rate strength. The
Cabinet discussed yesterday four measures proposed by the Bank
of Thailand aimed at slowing inflows and baht gains, the Bangkok
Post newspaper reported today, citing a member of parliament who
attended the meeting.  “The market has been waiting for any announcement on
capital measures,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a Hong Kong-based
strategist at Societe Generale SA. “But for now, no
announcement is likely.”  The baht climbed 0.6 percent to 29.38 per dollar as of 4:14
p.m. in Bangkok, the most since April 9, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency appreciated 0.5 percent
yesterday from May 3. Onshore financial markets were closed
Monday for a public holiday. The currency reached 29.74 on May
3, the weakest level since March 12.  It advanced 4.1 percent this year, the best performance
among  Asia ’s 11 most-traded currencies, and reached 28.56 on
April 22 and April 19, the strongest since July 1997.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 6.19 percent.  Foreign Investment  The Cabinet seeks more frequent updates from the central
bank, Varathep Rattanakorn, a minister in the Prime Minister’s
Office, told reporters in Bangkok today, without giving details.
The government should limit overseas investment in domestic
bonds to maturities of less than six months, Paiboon Nalinthrangkurn, chairman of the Federation of Thai Capital
Organizations, a trade group, said on May 3.  Foreign investors  bought $145 million more sovereign debt
than they sold this month through yesterday after net purchases
