Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-owned utility and oil producer, said first-quarter profit
fell to about a fifth of last year’s level as a production halt
in the North Sea hurt revenue and asset sales weren’t repeated.  Net income  declined to 106 million dirhams ($28.9 million)
from 534 million dirhams in the year-earlier period, the company
known as Taqa said in an e-mailed statement today. Taqa’s net
income for the first quarter of 2012 included a one-time 378
million-dirham gain from the disposal of Canadian assets. Sales
slipped 5.6 percent to 5.42 billion dirhams.  Taqa, owned 75 percent by the Abu Dhabi government, holds
stakes in businesses generating power or producing oil and
natural gas in the Middle East, the North Sea,  India  and North
America. The company expanded last year by taking over the
operation of an oil field in northern  Iraq  and buying productive
crude deposits off the U.K. coast from BP Plc.  Oil and gas sales decreased after Taqa shut a platform at
the North Sea Cormorant Alpha oil field, which produces 10,000
barrels a day of crude, because of a leak detected in March. No
oil spilled into the sea, and the company is continuing
maintenance work on the platform. The Brent pipeline system,
which Taqa also operates, resumed oil flow after closures in
January and March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
