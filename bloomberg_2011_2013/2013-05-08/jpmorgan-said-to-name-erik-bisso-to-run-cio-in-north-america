JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  has named Erik Bisso to run the bank’s chief investment office for  North
America , according to an internal memo sent today.  Bisso ran agency mortgage-backed securities pass-through
trading for the New York-based bank, according to the memo, a
copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. Bill Anast will
join JPMorgan in August to replace Bisso in that role, a person
familiar with the matter said. Anast previously ran the agency
collateralized-mortgage obligation business at  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   Bisso’s move “demonstrates our ongoing commitment to
developing senior talent and encouraging mobility across the
firm,” Matt Cherwin, head of securitized products, and Craig Delany, who runs the global chief investment office, wrote in
the memo.  Bisso will replace Irene Tse, the former head of the chief
investment office in North America, who left the bank last year
to start a hedge fund, people familiar with the plan said at the
time.  Liz Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan and Brandon
Ashcraft of Barclays declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
