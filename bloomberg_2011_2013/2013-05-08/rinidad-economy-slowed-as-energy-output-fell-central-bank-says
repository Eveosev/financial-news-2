Trinidad & Tobago ’s economy slowed in
the fourth quarter as the world’s fifth-largest producer of
liquefied natural gas saw energy production fall due to
maintenance stoppages and lower oil output from maturing fields.  The island nation’s gross domestic product increased 1
percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 from a year earlier, down
from 1.8 percent growth in the previous three-month period, the
central bank said in a  preliminary statement  today. Trinidad &
Tobago’s economy has contracted in three of the previous six
quarters, including a 2.1 percent decrease in the fourth quarter
of 2011.  The non-energy sector expanded 1.7 percent, as agriculture
increased 2.6 percent and construction 2.3 percent from a year
earlier. Consumer prices climbed  6.9 percent  in the first
quarter from a year earlier, driven by a 12.9 percent rise in
food costs, the bank said.  Trinidad & Tobago, a natural gas producer located just
north of Venezuela, has an A rating from  Standard & Poor’s ,
putting the island nation of 1.4 million people in the same
category as Slovakia and Oman.  The country will sell $156 million of 7-year local bonds
with a 2.6 percent coupon on May 21, according to the central
bank. The sale of the dollar notes will help absorb liquidity in
the banking sector, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
