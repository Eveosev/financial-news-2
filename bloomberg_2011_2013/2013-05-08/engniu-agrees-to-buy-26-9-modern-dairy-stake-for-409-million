China Mengniu Dairy Co. (2319) , the country’s
largest dairy producer, agreed to buy a 26.9 percent stake in
 China Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd. (1117)  for HK$3.18 billion ($409
million) to gain greater control of milk supplies.  Mengniu will pay HK$2.45 a share for the Modern Dairy
stake, the company said in a filing to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange today. That’s 12 percent less than Modern Dairy’s
closing price yesterday.  Acquiring the shares in Modern Dairy, a producer of raw
milk, will give Hohhot, Inner Mongolia-based Mengniu more control
of its supplies as concerns about safety in China’s dairy
industry linger. Police in March detained a distributor
suspected of repackaging and selling milk powder made by Swiss
company Hero Group that wasn’t licensed for sale in  China , the
official Xinhua News Agency reported at the time.  Mengniu said in its statement that the investment in Modern
Dairy is consistent with its strategy of enhancing “the quality
of its milk sources and securing long-term premium milk
supply.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
