Rosatom Corp. has invited  Electricite
de France SA (EDF)  to help build Turkey’s first nuclear power plant as
the Russian state atomic power company seeks partners for its
new reactors.  Rosatom is ready to reduce its stakes in the planned Akkuyu
nuclear power plant in Turkey and the Baltic plant in Russia to
as much as 51 percent from 100 percent now, Vladislav Bochkov, a
spokesman for the Moscow-based company, said by phone today.  “Rosatom is ready for a strategic partnership with all
major energy companies, including EDF,” Bochkov said. He
confirmed comments by Rosatom Deputy Chief Executive Officer
Nikolai Spassky  reported  in French daily  Les Echos  on May 6.  Turkey imported more than $60 billion in energy last year
and is seeking ways to improve energy efficiency, Finance
Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said in April. A single nuclear plant
would reduce Turkey’s current-account deficit, the third-largest
in the world last year, by about $3 billion, he said. Turkey
picked Russia’s Rosatom and ZAO Atomstroyexport for its first
facility at a cost of $20 billion in 2010.  EDF’s press office in Paris didn’t immediately respond to a
phone call and e-mail asking for comment.  The plant in the town of Akkuyu on the Mediterranean coast
will have a capacity of 4,800 megawatts.  Rosatom may also extend cooperation with France’s  Areva SA (AREVA) ,
Bochkov said.  “We are ready to cooperate with all suppliers or equipment
and services, including with Areva, on a tender basis,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
