Germany’s bonds rose, with 10-year
bunds snapping a three-day decline, as demand from investors
increased at a 5 billion-euro ($6.59 billion) auction of new
five-year notes.  European  government bonds  rallied after Executive Board
member Joerg Asmussen said the  European Central Bank  was
considering buying asset-backed securities to support lending to
small and medium-sized enterprises.  Portugal ’s 10-year yields
dropped to the lowest level since August 2010 after the nation
sold securities maturing in 2024 via banks yesterday.  Spain 
plans to sell as much as 4.5 billion euros of bonds due between
2016 and 2026 tomorrow.  “The German auction went OK,” said Owen Callan, an
analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Dublin. “Germany’s notes aren’t
cheap, they yield very little but 5 billion euros is not a lot
to sell. Now people are really trying to figure out what these
comments from the ECB mean and what’s next and whether the rally
in higher-yielding assets has further to go.”  Germany ’s  10-year yield  dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.27 percent at 4:37 p.m. London time after
rising to 1.31 percent yesterday, the highest level since April
11. The 1.5 percent bund due in February 2023 gained 0.27, or
2.70 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.105.  The  five-year  yield dropped two basis points to 0.37
percent after climbing six basis points yesterday, the biggest
increase since Jan. 28.  Bids Increase  Germany received bids for 8.508 billion euros of the new
five-year notes compared with its target of 5 billion euros, the
Bundesbank said. The government allotted 4.047 billion euros of
the securities at an average yield of 0.38 percent, versus 0.33
percent at the previous auction on April 3. The record-low
auction yield for five-year notes is 0.31 percent on Aug. 1.  Referring to an article published in German newspaper Die
Welt saying the ECB is considering buying asset-backed
securities, the ECB’s Asmussen said: “It’s part of the ongoing
work that we have to see what we can do to spur SME lending.”  He also told lawmakers in Brussels that policy makers
“have an open mind to look at all things we can do within our
mandate, and this relates to how can the market for asset-backed
securities, especially backed by SME loans, be revived in
 Europe , of course under strict supervision.”  Italian  10-year yields  dropped three basis points to 3.84
percent, while similar-maturity Spanish yields fell one basis
point to 4.10 percent.  Negative Rate  The ECB cut its benchmark rate to a record low of 0.5
percent at its most recent policy meeting on May 2 and President
 Mario Draghi  said the central bank had an open mind about a
negative deposit rate.  Portugal’s 10-year bonds gained after yesterday’s sale
attracted demand for more than three times the amount the
government was seeking.  The yield on the 4.95 percent bond due in October 2023
dropped nine basis points to 5.43 percent, the lowest level
since Aug. 31, 2010.  “We are quite happy” with the sale, Portugal’s debt chief
Joao Moreira Rato said yesterday in a telephone interview. “We
have more than 360 investors and the book was three-times
oversubscribed. It was a big worry of ours to price well and to
have the right size so I hope it performs in the next few
weeks.”  Irish  two-year notes  were little changed after yields fell
as much as four basis points to 0.742 percent, the lowest since
Bloomberg began tracking the securities in November 2003.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of the Netherlands and Portugal,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German bonds returned 0.5 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Portuguese
securities gained 5.9 percent and Irish bonds rose 8.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
