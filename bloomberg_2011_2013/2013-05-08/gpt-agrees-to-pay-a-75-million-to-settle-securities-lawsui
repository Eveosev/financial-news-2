GPT Group (GPT) , an Australian real estate
trust with about A$13.9 billion ($14 billion) of assets, agreed
to pay A$75 million to settle a securities lawsuit following a
trial in Melbourne and before a judge’s ruling.  More than 2,300 investors, who bought GPT Management
Holdings Ltd.’s stapled securities between Feb. 27, 2008, and
July 6, 2008, sued in 2011, claiming the company issued
misleading statements about its finances.  “The settlement provides a strong return on the losses
claimed, and reflects the strength of the evidence presented at
trial,” Ben Phi, class action  lawyer at Slater & Gordon , which
represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement today.  GPT shares plunged 15 percent, the most in more than two
decades, on July 7, 2008, after the Sydney-based company cut its
profit and dividend estimates as it cited worsening conditions
in global financial and property markets. Credit tightening that
year led to the worst global recession since the depression of
the 1930s.  GPT, which denied liability under the terms of the
agreement, said today that the claim was insured and the
settlement won’t have a material impact on its  finances .  The settlement must be approved by a Federal Court judge.  A four-week trial ended in Federal Court in  Melbourne  last
month. Federal Court Justice Michelle Gordon, who oversaw the
trial, had reserved her decision on the case.  The case is Modtech Engineering Pty v. GPT Management
Holdings Ltd. VID 1408/2011. Federal Court of  Australia 
(Melbourne).  To contact the reporter on this story:
