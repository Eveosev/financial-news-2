National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the
country’s largest lender by assets, boosted first-half cash
profit by 3.1 percent on higher earnings in personal and
wholesale banking.  Cash profit , which excludes one-time items, climbed to
A$2.92 billion ($2.97 billion) in the six months ended March 31
from A$2.83 billion a year earlier, the Melbourne-based lender
said in a statement today. Analysts estimated earnings on that
basis of A$2.89 billion, the median prediction of nine surveyed
by Bloomberg News. Net profit for the period increased 23
percent to A$2.52 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Cameron Clyne is seeking a bigger
share of  Australia ’s mortgage lending, which is growing at its
slowest pace ever. Clyne plans to shed A$800 million in cost
over five years as the bank simplifies products and invests in
new technology after paring U.K. operations, where mounting bad
debts last year triggered the first profit drop since 2009.  “The management is on the right track to bury the problems
of the past,” David Ellis, an analyst at  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , said
before the earnings announcement. “Investors are gaining more
confidence with no new disasters in recent times.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
