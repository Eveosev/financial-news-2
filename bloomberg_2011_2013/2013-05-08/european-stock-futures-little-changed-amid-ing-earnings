manager at  Jersey , Channel Islands-based Ashburton Ltd. “The

was quite low to start with. Now you’ve got to look at the
revenue outlook for the rest of the year.”  German  industrial production  increased for a second month
in March, a report showed. Production rose 1.2 percent from
February, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a 0.1 percent decline.  China Trade  In  China , a report from the General Administration of

0.8 percent. Sweden’s OMX Stockholm 30 rose 1.1 percent as it
closed early on the eve of Ascension Day.  ING climbed 3.1 percent to 6.79 euros as the Dutch lender
posted first-quarter  net income  of 1.8 billion euros ($2.4
billion). That beat the 1.48 billion euros average prediction of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The financial-services company
registered a 950 million-euro gain for the period from selling
assets in  Hong Kong ,  Thailand  and Macau.  Chief Executive Officer Jan Hommen said in a statement that

euros a year by 2015.  Deutsche Telekom  Deutsche Telekom gained 4.7 percent to 9.56 euros after

business in Latin America.  The French operator of  call centers  also said its margin on
earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, excluding one-off items, will grow by 9.3 percent to 9.5 percent in 2013,
confirming its previous guidance.  Profit Decline  Standard Chartered dropped 4.4 percent to 1,625 pence, its
biggest plunge since August 2012. Britain’s second-largest
lender by market value said first-quarter operating profit
declined because wholesale-banking revenue decreased.  “The group had a very strong start to the year in January,
but momentum slowed later in the quarter,” the lender said in a
statement.  Telefonica SA slid 0.9 percent to 11.18 euros as  Spain ’s
largest telecommunications operator said operating income before
depreciation and amortization fell 10 percent in the first
quarter to 4.57 billion euros. That missed the average analyst
projection for 4.75 billion euros. The company said competition
hurt sales in  Latin America  and Europe.  Brenntag AG slipped 6.7 percent to 122.15 euros, the most
since its initial public offering in March 2010, as the world’s
largest distributor of chemicals reported first-quarter earnings
that missed analysts’ estimates.  “Due to the macroeconomic uncertainty, and under the
assumption of no recovery in the overall economic environment,
we expect growth at a slower pace,”  the company  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
