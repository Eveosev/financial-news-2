The yen is poised to rally 8 percent
to about 91 per dollar, according to Elliott Wave Theory
analysis, after being the worst performer among 10 major
currencies in the past six months.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the Elliott Wave, which is based
on the idea that market swings follow a five-stage pattern. The
chart indicates the yen completed its third bearish cycle that
lasted from September to last month, according to Naohiko Miyata, chief technical analyst in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co. The currency is now in a fourth
wave that may propel it to 91.23 yen, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the third cycle, in coming months.  Japan ’s currency came within 0.1 percent of 100 yen per
dollar last month, a level unseen in four years, after Bank of
Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda surpassed economist expectations
by pledging to double monthly bond purchases and buy longer-term
debt to reach a 2 percent annual inflation goal. The yen rose
0.1 percent to 98.93 per dollar at 6:45 a.m. in Tokyo.  The Japanese currency’s 1 percent rally since reaching
99.95 on April 11 signaled the end of the third wave, Miyata
said. The first wave began on Feb. 1, 2012 as it fell from 76.03
to an 11-month low of 84.18 on March 15. The second wave lasted
until Sept. 13, when the yen rose to 77.13, he said.  “I don’t expect the yen’s slide in the fifth wave to be as
big as the one seen in the third,” Miyata said, adding the
currency will not weaken past 105.50, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement from its gain from the June 2007 low of 124.14 to
the post war record of 75.35 reached in October 2011.  Elliott Wave Theory, created by American accountant and
author Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s, seeks to predict moves
in markets by dividing past trends into five sections, or waves.
Fibonacci studies are based on the theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  The yen has fallen more than 20 percent in the past six
months, the most among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
