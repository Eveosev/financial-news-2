Russian stocks advanced to the highest
in almost six weeks boosted by state-run  OAO Gazprom (OGZD)  and  OAO
Rosneft (ROSN)  after the government was said to plan an increase in
dividend payments.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rose 0.2 percent to 1,432.94 at the close,
the highest since March 29. Gazprom gained to the strongest
level since April 1, while oil producer Rosneft rose to the
highest in nearly a month.  Federal Grid Co. (FEES) , the state-run power
transmission monopoly, tumbled 4.2 percent on a report that
ministers plan to cut a proposed tariff increase for 2014-2015.  The government is considering an increase in dividends paid
by state-controlled companies to 35 percent of profit to boost
budget revenue, according to three officials with knowledge of
the matter. In November state companies were ordered to pay no
less than 25 percent of their net income. Rosneft added 1.3
percent to 221.34 rubles and natural gas exporter Gazprom
advanced 1.1 percent to 131.86 rubles.  The measure would increase the  dividend yield  of the
Russian equity market to about 4.5 percent from current 3.8
percent and “at least pay lip service to the concept of
improving corporate governance,” Julian Rimmer, who trades
Russian and Turkish stocks at CF Global Trading UK Ltd., said by
e-mail. “Clearly Gazprom would be the main beneficiary of this
policy.”  Dividend Recommendations  Gazprom management recommended a dividend of 5.99 rubles a
share for last year, the company said in April. Rosneft plans a
2012 payment of 8.05 rubles a share, the crude producer said on
May 6.  A 35 percent dividend payout will clearly be positive,
according to Joseph Dayan, head of markets at BCS Financial
Group in  London .  “Investors tend to underweight government controlled
companies in  Russia ,” he said by e-mail. “They are often
perceived as black holes for capex that tend to return little
cash flow to minority investors.”  The government will review the power grids’ pricing system
at a meeting on May 13 chaired by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, the Kommersant newspaper  said  today. The Economy
Ministry is seeking a 6 percent increase in power tariffs for
grid companies for 2014-2015 compared with 9 percent to 10
percent planned earlier, Interfax reported April 25.  “People anticipate a new wave of pressure on power
prices,” Mikhail Rasstrigin, an analyst at VTB Capital, said by
phone from Moscow. “Investors don’t like all these discussions
nor do they like the companies saying they need more money for
investment.”  OAO Russian Grids, formerly known as MRSK Holding, dropped
3.4 percent to 1.325 rubles. Federal Grid fell for a third day
to 12.395 kopeks. A kopek is one hundredth of a ruble.  Dixy Shines  OAO Dixy Group (DIXY)  jumped 5.4 percent to 447 rubles, the
highest since February 28. The food retailer plans to report its
April sales data next week. Larger competitor OAO Magnit
reported 33 percent revenue increase in April on the back of 31
percent expansion of selling space. Magnit gained as much as 3.1
percent today before closing down 1.7 percent at 6,889 rubles.  “Magnit is a sort of read-across for peers,” Natalia Kolupaeva, an analyst at ZAO Raiffeisenbank, said by phone from
Moscow. The results show “there is no slowdown in
consumption,” she said.  The number of shares traded on the Micex was 10 percent
below its 30-day average. The dollar-denominated RTS was little
changed at 1452.17. The Moscow Exchange is closed tomorrow for a
national holiday, while most businesses will remain shut through
the week.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex  trades  at 5.4
times 12-month estimated earnings and has lost 2.8 percent this
year, compared with  11 times  for the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index, which has climbed 0.7 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
