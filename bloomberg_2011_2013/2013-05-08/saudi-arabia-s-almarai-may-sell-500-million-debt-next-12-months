Almarai Co., the Saudi food producer
operating a joint venture with  PepsiCo Inc., (PEP)  is considering
tapping global debt markets for about $500 million as it seeks
to expand in the U.S.,  Argentina  and Ukraine.  The company plans to sell the bonds in the next 12 months
to diversify its funding sources and to invest in facilities,
overseas farms and its distribution network, Chief Financial
Officer Paul-Louis Gay told reporters in Riyadh today. The debt
may be an Islamic bond or a hybrid sukuk, he said.  Almarai,  Saudi Arabia ’s largest food producer, said in
April it raised 1.3 billion riyals ($347 million) from the
private placement of Islamic bonds with investors in Saudi
Arabia. The sale was part of a 2.3 billion-riyal sukuk program
it set up last year. Almarai has a 15.7 billion-riyal, five-year
investment program to boost output and develop products.  Companies and governments in the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council are tapping the Islamic  bond market  as
borrowing costs decline. The average yield on sukuk in the
region has fallen 68 basis points in the past 12 months to 3.23
percent May 7, according to the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai GCC US Dollar
Sukuk Index. Sales in the region have reached $9.5 billion,
little changed from the year-earlier period.  Almarai’s first-quarter profit rose 5.4 percent to 255.1
million riyals, missing the 292.9 million-riyal mean estimate of
10 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s shares have increased  3.5 percent  this year
compared with a 6  percent  gain in Saudi Arabia’s benchmark
index. The stock rose 0.4 percent to 65.75 riyals, the highest
on a closing basis since April 3, at 12:42 p.m. in  Riyadh .  To contact the reporters on this story:
