Steve Eisman, who rose to fame betting
against subprime mortgages, said investors should buy shares of
homebuilders, land and mortgage lenders as the U.S. housing
market improves.  “Housing is attractively priced versus incomes,” Eisman,
founder of Emrys Partners LP, said at the 18th Sohn Investment
Conference in  New York  today. “While homebuilders are cheap,
they have not priced in how much fundamentals have improved.”  Eisman recommended the stocks of  Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) ,
 Colony Financial Inc. (CLNY)  and Forestar Group. Forestar rose as much
as 7.9 percent and Ocwen gained as much as 3.3 percent.  Eisman said he was pessimistic about the Canadian housing
market where rising prices weren’t accompanied by growth in
personal incomes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
