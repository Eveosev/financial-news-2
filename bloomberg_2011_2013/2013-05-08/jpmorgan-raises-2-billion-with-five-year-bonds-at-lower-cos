JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  was among
borrowers including State Street Corp. and  Statoil ASA (STL)  selling
at least $15.6 billion of bonds in the U.S. today.  The biggest U.S. bank issued $2 billion of 1.625 percent,
five-year notes at narrower relative yields than those on
similar-maturity debt sold four months ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A spread of 92 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries compares with an extra yield of 103
basis points for $1.25 billion of 1.8 percent, five-year
debentures that New York-based JPMorgan sold Jan. 17.  Statoil, the largest Norwegian energy company, sold $3
billion of debt in a four-part offering that included $900
million of 2.65 percent bonds due 2024 that pay 90 basis points
more than Treasuries, $850 million of 30-year, 3.95 percent debt
with an extra yield of 95 basis points, $750 million of 1.15
percent notes maturing 2018 that pay 45 more than benchmarks and
$500 million of similar-maturity, floating-rate bonds that yield
29 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate.  State Street, the third-largest custody bank, sold $1
billion of 3.1 percent, 10-year bonds that yield 135 basis
points more than Treasuries and $500 million of 1.35 percent
debt due 2018 with a spread of 62.5, Bloomberg data show.  Other issuers today included  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , HSBC Holdings Plc and  Brinker International Inc. (EAT) ,
the owner of the Chili’s and Maggiano’s dining chains.  Libor (US0003M) ,
the rate at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other, was set at 0.275 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
