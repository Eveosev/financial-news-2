Victoria ,  Australia ’s second-most
populous state, plans to boost management of its water resources
by increasing funding by A$50 million ($51 million).  “The work will make sure the use of rainfall, stormwater
and wastewater is maximized to reduce the need for future large-
scale pipelines, desalination plants and pumping and treatment
plants,” Water Minister  Peter Walsh  said in a  statement 
yesterday as the government released its annual budget.  Other water projects to receive funding include an
observation bore network that studies the health of aquifers,
floods mitigation, modernizing the Macalister Irrigation
District and improving the Murray-Darling Basin.  Victoria is still paying about A$1.8 million a day for an
idled desalination plant. Walsh’s Liberal-National coalition
inherited the A$3.5 billion Wonthaggi plant when it beat Labor
in the November 2010 state election. Since the plant was ordered
in 2007, the nation’s most prolonged drought has ended.  To contact the reporter on this story:
