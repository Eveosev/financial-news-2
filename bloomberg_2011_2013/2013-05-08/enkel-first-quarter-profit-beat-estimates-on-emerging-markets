Henkel AG, the German maker of Dial
soap and Loctite glue, reported first-quarter profit that beat
estimates as rising sales in  emerging markets  offset revenue
declines in western  Europe  and  north America .  Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes rose 8.9
percent to 600 million euros ($786 million) from 551 million
euros a year earlier, the Dusseldorf-based company said in a
statement today. That beat the 582.1 million-euro  average
estimate  of seven analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect the global economic environment to remain
difficult,” Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted said in the
statement. “We anticipate industrial demand to improve during
the second half of the year.”  Sales coming from emerging markets accounted for 43 percent
of Henkel’s revenue last year, helping reduce the company’s
reliance on  western Europe , where government austerity measures
to counter the debt crisis deepened a recession. The jobless
rate in the euro area rose to a record of 12.1 percent in March.  Net income rose 8.9 percent from a year earlier to 403
million euros, Henkel said. Sales rose 0.6 percent to 4.03
billion euros, missing the 4.14 billion-euro average of 10
analyst estimates, as adhesives sales declined 1.2 percent
organically amid “weaker” demand from industrial customers.  Sales grew 2.5 percent organically, missing the 3.6 percent
average estimate of seven analysts compiled by Bloomberg.
Organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign
exchange and acquisitions or divestments, was the slowest since
2011.  Middle East  Organic sales rose 7.3 percent in Eastern Europe and 18.2
percent in  Africa  and the  Middle East  region, while they fell 1
percent in western Europe. Sales in North America dropped 0.4
percent organically.  Adjusted Ebit as proportion of sales rose to 14.9 percent
from 13.7 percent a year earlier.  The maker of Schwarzkopf shampoo reiterated its forecast
for sales growth of 3 percent to 5 percent this year. The
company predicts Ebit as a proportion of revenue will widen to
about 14.5 percent from 14.1 percent last year, and adjusted
earnings per preferred share will rise by about 10 percent.  Henkel shares  have gained 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
