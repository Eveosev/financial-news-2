Toronto Blue Jays pitcher J.A. Happ
was taken to a hospital after he was hit in the head by a line
drive from Desmond Jennings of the Tampa Bay Rays.  Happ, 30, collapsed face down on the mound and was taken
from the field on a stretcher after the ball ricocheted off his
head and up the right-field line during the second inning at
Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg,  Florida .  There was no word on his condition after the game, manager
John Gibbons told reporters.  The incident was reminiscent of Oakland Athletics pitcher
Brandon McCarthy getting hit in the head by a line drive last
September, causing a skull fracture that required surgery and a
six-day hospital stay. He now pitches for the  Arizona 
Diamondbacks.  Jennings reached third base, driving in two runs, before
the umpires stopped the game to allow Happ to get medical
attention.  The game was delayed 11 minutes while medics stabilized the
pitcher’s head and neck and placed a bandage over the area of
his left eye and ear.  Happ, who had allowed four runs on five hits in 1 1/3
innings, was conscious and moved his hands as he was taken off
the field.  Happ is 2-2 with a 4.91 earned-run average in six games
this season.  The Blue Jays won the game 6-4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
