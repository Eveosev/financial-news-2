The  yuan  rose to a 19-year high as the
central bank strengthened the daily fixing to a record and
Chinese exports topped analysts’ estimates.  The currency completed its biggest two-day gain in 15
months as an official report showed overseas sales rose 14.7
percent in April from a year earlier, beating the 9.2 percent
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey and March’s 10 percent
gain. The People’s Bank of China raised the daily  reference rate 
0.17 percent to a record 6.1980 per dollar. The currency can
diverge a maximum 1 percent from the fixing.  The yuan rose 0.21 percent to 6.1410 per dollar in
 Shanghai , taking the two-day gain to 0.42 percent, the most
since Jan. 31, 2012, according to the  China  Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency touched 6.1396 earlier, the strongest
level since the government unified official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993.  “The size of capital inflows into China and onshore demand
for the yuan continue to dominate,” said Khoon Goh, a
strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in
 Singapore . “I still expect further near-term appreciation
pressure.”  Yuan positions at Chinese financial institutions stemming
from foreign-exchange transactions, a gauge of cross-border
capital flows, climbed 236 billion yuan ($38 billion) in March,
central bank data show. Gains are a sign of inflows, and the
positions increased 1.22 trillion yuan in the first three months
of this year.  Five-Year Plan  China may introduce a five-year plan for yuan capital-
account convertibility this year, China Securities Journal
reported today, citing Chen Bingcai, a former deputy chief at
State Administration of Foreign Exchange’s capital account
management department. The yuan’s capital account may be
convertible by 2020, the report said.  In  Hong Kong , the yuan gained 0.25 percent to 6.1414 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month
non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.29 percent to 6.21, a 1.1
percent discount to the onshore  exchange rate . One-month implied
volatility in the yuan, a measure of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, increased 26 basis points,
or 0.26 percentage point, to 1.76 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
