Copper traded near the highest level
in three weeks before  China , the biggest consumer, releases
April trade data. Aluminum, zinc and lead advanced.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.5 percent to $7,302 a metric ton and
was at $7,289.75 at 9:27 a.m. in  Shanghai . Copper advanced to
$7,374 yesterday, the highest since April 15. The contract for
delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.8
percent to 52,600  yuan  ($8,548) a ton, while July futures on
Comex rose 0.3 percent to $3.3135 per pound.  China’s  export growth  may have slowed to 9.2 percent in
April, compared with 10 percent in March, while imports may have
risen 13 percent, down from 14.1 percent in the previous month,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. The customs department may
release the data around 10 a.m. local time. The nation accounts
for more than 40 percent of global copper consumption.  “The data will provide clues to the market direction after
weaker-than-expected data last month,” said Wang Na, an analyst
at Guolian Futures Co. “Given the relatively weak  market
sentiment , copper may not get a strong boost even if the data
turn out to be better than expected.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
