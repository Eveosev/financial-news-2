Stocks in Switzerland  rose, extending
the benchmark Swiss Market Index’s highest level in more than
five years, as Chinese imports and exports increased more than
forecast and  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  climbed after releasing earnings.  Holcim, the world’s largest cement maker, added 2.2
percent, even after reporting a decline in adjusted first-
quarter profit.  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  gained 2.9 percent after saying
its selexipag drug showed reduction in pulmonary vascular
resistance in a study.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s
second-biggest bank, extended a 21-month high.  The SMI increased 0.5 percent to 8,019.74 at 10:30 a.m. in
Zurich, the highest level since January 2008. The gauge is on
course for a ninth consecutive month of gains, which would be
the longest winning streak since 1997. The SMI has rallied 18
percent this year. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
advanced 0.5 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 35 percent greater than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China ’s exports rose 14.7 percent in April, the General
Administration of Customs said, beating the 9.2 percent median
forecast of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Imports climbed 16.8
percent, compared with the average projection of 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
