 Brent crude futures fell for a third
session as U.S. inventories increased. Iraq resumed oil exports
via  Turkey  today after a halt caused by sabotage to a pipeline.  Brent dropped as much as 0.8 percent. Total U.S. crude
stockpiles rose by 230,000 barrels, according to the Energy
Department. Iraq’s state-run North Oil Co. repaired the pipeline
to Turkey following a bombing attack yesterday in the city of
Mosul. Weekly U.S. jobless claims dropped to 323,000, 13,000
fewer than had been expected, according to a Bloomberg survey,
and 3,000 fewer than in the previous week.  “We have seen a good rally over the last few days after
the lows of last week, and now the market is taking stock,”
said  Michael Hewson , a market analyst at CMC Markets Plc in
London who expects WTI to peak at $98 this year. “The latest
weekly jobless claims failed to inspire any further
enthusiasm.”  Brent for June settlement fell as much as 79 cents to
$103.55 a barrel and was at $103.68 as of 1:40 p.m. London time
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. The volume of all contracts
traded was 12 percent below the 100-day average.  West Texas Intermediate for June delivery was down 87 cents
at $95.75 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The volume of contracts traded was 30
percent above the 100-day average. The front-month European
benchmark was at a premium of $7.89 to WTI.  U.S. Inventories  The increase in U.S. crude inventories compares with a
projected gain of 2 million in a Bloomberg News survey. Refinery
run rates climbed 2.6 percentage points, the most since
September, to 87 percent.  Gasoline stockpiles declined by  910,000 barrels  last week,
data from the Energy Information Administration show. They were
forecast to slip by 475,000 barrels, according to the median
estimate of 12 analysts in the Bloomberg survey. The U.S.
Memorial Day holiday on May 27 marks the start of the nation’s
peak driving period.  Distillate inventories, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, increased 1.8 million barrels, according to the
EIA. They were predicted to advance by 500,000 barrels, the
Bloomberg survey showed.  The 500-mile (805-kilometer) Seaway pipeline operated by
 Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  won’t be able
to carry its expected average of 335,000 barrels a day of crude
in its first year of operation since it was expanded, according
to a filing with the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
yesterday. Daily throughput will average about 295,000 barrels
through May, the filing shows.  Seaway, which transports crude from Cushing, the largest
U.S. oil-storage hub, to refineries in the Houston area, is
operating below capacity because of limited offtake capability
at the end of the line, which won’t be repaired until next year.
The pipeline’s capacity was increased to 400,000 barrels a day
on Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
