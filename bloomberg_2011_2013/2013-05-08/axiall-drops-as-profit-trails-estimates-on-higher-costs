Axiall Corp. (AXLL) , the vinyl-products maker
that changed its name from Georgia Gulf Corp. in January, fell
the most in almost a year after posting first-quarter earnings
that missed analysts’ estimates amid higher costs.  Axiall declined 8.5 percent to $50.69 as of 10:19 a.m. in
 New York . The shares earlier dropped 12 percent, the most
intraday since May 18.  Adjusted earnings fell to 75 cents a share, Atlanta-based
Axiall said today in a statement. The average of nine estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was $1.18 a share. The Jan. 28 acquisition
of chlorine assets from  PPG Industries Inc. (PPG)  helped boost sales
23 percent to $1.06 billion, the company said, trailing the
$1.13 billion average estimate.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization in the chlorovinyls unit, which has more sales than
the other two businesses combined, nearly tripled on the
chlorine unit acquisition. Earnings gains were restrained by
lower selling prices for resins and higher costs for ethylene, a
raw material in the manufacture of vinyl, Axiall said.  “The issue was margins,” Jeffrey J. Zekauskas, a New
York-based analyst at JP Morgan Chase & Co. who recommends
buying the shares, said today in a report. Ethylene prices “may
have been a primary source of the margin squeeze.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
