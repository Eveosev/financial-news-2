Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) , the maker
of Subaru cars, will invest $400 million to boost U.S. capacity
by the end of 2016 as demand rises for its vehicles including
the Forester SUV and XV crossover.  Fuji Heavy  will use an existing line at its Lafayette,
Indiana, factory to increase output to 400,000 units, and will
also begin producing its Impreza model at the plant, President
Yasuyuki Yoshinaga said in Tokyo today. The company previously
targeted output of 300,000 units by 2014.  Shares of Fuji Heavy surged to the highest level in almost
four decades after the automaker  forecast  operating profit will
jump 50 percent to 180 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in the year
ending March 2014, helped by demand in the U.S. The Tokyo-based
carmaker also plans to hire 900 people for the Lafayette plant
as it now sells more vehicles in the U.S., its largest market,
than it makes locally.  U.S. deliveries will rise about 8 percent to 385,000 units
this fiscal year, Fuji Heavy said. That’s 51 percent of global
deliveries of 752,000 units, according to company  figures .  Fuji Heavy gained 2.1 percent to 1,898 yen in  Tokyo 
trading, the highest close since at least 1974.  Net income will probably decline 8 percent to 110 billion
yen in the year started April 1, while sales will rise 7.2
percent to 2.05 trillion yen, according to the statement. That
compares with analysts’ projections for profit and revenue of
116 billion yen and 2.08 trillion yen respectively, based on the
average of 18  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit Surges  Net income at Fuji Heavy more than tripled to 119.6 billion
yen in the year ended March, and sales climbed 26 percent to
1.91 trillion yen.  Fuji Heavy shares have advanced 76 percent this year. The
stock more than doubled in 2012, the best performer on the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Tensions over a territorial dispute
disrupted production by some of Fuji Heavy’s Japanese rivals
last year in  China , where the automaker doesn’t have factories.  The carmaker, 16 percent owned by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , has
allocated about a third of its 300,000-unit U.S. capacity to
make Camry sedans for Toyota. Yoshinaga has said he will
maintain the production contract.  The Lafayette plant opened in 1989, initially as a joint
venture with truckmaker  Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202)  It currently makes
Outback wagons, Legacy sedans and Tribeca SUVs as well as Camry
sedans for Toyota under contract.  To contact the reporters on this story:
