Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , dropped to the lowest level on
record after first-quarter  profit  missed analyst estimates.  The shares, which have traded without the right for a 50-
forint dividend since yesterday, fell 5 percent to 343 forint by
the close in Budapest. Volume was 176 percent of the stock’s
three-month average. The benchmark BUX stock  index  dropped 0.2
percent to 18,458.42, having risen 3.4 percent in the second
quarter.  Net income for the first three months stood at 1.7 billion
forint ($7.6 million), Magyar Telekom said in a  statement  to the
Budapest Stock Exchange today. That compared with a median
estimate of 5.75 billion forint in a Bloomberg survey of four
analysts. A tax on utility infrastructure introduced last year
hit earnings, while a government-imposed price cut in January
wiped out margins in Magyar Telekom’s energy unit, the company
said.  “Profit all but disappeared,” putting pressure on the
shares, Zsolt Balasy, a Budapest-based equities analyst at MKB
Bank, a unit of Bayerische Landesbank, wrote in a research
report today. “It is especially concerning that energy retail,
the unit expanding fastest at the moment, has become
unprofitable because of the price cuts.”  While Magyar Telekom’s “positive” business performance
supports dividend plans,  Hungary ’s macroeconomic prospects are
less certain, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Janos Szabo told
reporters today, declining to provide a dividend target for the
coming year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
