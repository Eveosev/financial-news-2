Mexican central bank policymakers, who
cut the benchmark rate this year for the first time since 2009,
said they will take into account the lax monetary policies being
carried out in other countries in future decisions.  Wealthier countries may find ways to further ease monetary
policy, bank Governor Agustin Carstens told reporters in  Mexico 
City today at the release of the quarterly inflation report.
Latin America’s second-biggest economy showed signs of weakness
in the first quarter, when growth moderated, he said. The
economy will expand 3 percent to 4 percent this year, the report
said.  The central bank, known as Banxico, maintained its 2013
growth and inflation forecasts in a quarterly report published
today. Policymakers, led by Carstens, cut the benchmark rate to
4 percent from 4.5 percent in March. The bank held the rate at
its April 26 meeting, making no direct mention of a possible
rate move.  The bank said today it would remain alert to the impact of
certain price changes as well as “the evolution of Mexico’s
relative monetary policy compared to other economies.”  Consumer prices rose 4.72 percent in the first half of
April, the national statistics agency reported April 24.    Inflation “should be expected to remain at elevated levels
in April and May and resume a downward trend from June to settle
in the second half of the year between 3 and 4 percent,” the
bank said in a statement accompaning its April rate decision.
“For 2014 we anticipate headline inflation will settle very
close to 3 percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
