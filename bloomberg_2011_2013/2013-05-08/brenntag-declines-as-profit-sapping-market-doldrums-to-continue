Brenntag AG (BNR) , the world’s largest
distributor of chemicals, dropped the most in three years in
Frankfurt trading after profit missed analysts’ estimates.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization declined 4 percent to 164.7 million euros ($216
million) in the first quarter, the company said today. That
missed analysts’ average estimate of 181.5 million euros,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company said it
assumes there will no “no recovery in the overall economic
environment” this year. The shares fell as much as 7.8 percent.  “The global economic situation is even more demanding and
economic development is still muted,” Chief Executive Officer
Steven Holland said in the release. “Our sales performance
should be understood in light of these factors and the fact that
the first quarter had considerably fewer working days than the
same period of the previous year.”  Brenntag, based in Muelheim an der Ruhr,  Germany , said it’s
budgeting for slower growth this year. While the company is
benefiting from expansion in Asia Pacific as well as Latin
America and acquisitions in markets from New Zealand to the
U.S., it’s facing stagnant sales closer to home as  Europe ’s
economy struggles to recover.  Brenntag shares dropped as much as 10.15 euros to 120.75
euros, the biggest intraday drop since May 2010, and were down
6.6 percent at 122.3 euros as of 10:03 a.m.  Sales rose 1.4 percent to 2.42 billion euros, missing
analysts’ average estimate of 2.5 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
