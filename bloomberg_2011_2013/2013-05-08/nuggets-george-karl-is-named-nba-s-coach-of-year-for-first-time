George Karl of the Denver Nuggets was
named the National Basketball Association’s Coach of the Year
for the first time after leading his team to a league-best 38-3
home record and a No. 3 playoff seed.  Karl received 62 of a possible 121 first-place votes and a
total of 404 points in balloting by sportswriters and
broadcasters in the U.S. and Canada, topping runner-up  Erik Spoelstra  of the Miami Heat, who received 24 first-place votes
and 190 points, the NBA said in a news release.  The  New York  Knicks’  Mike Woodson  was third, named first on
six ballots, followed by the San Antonio Spurs’  Gregg Popovich ,
who received 11 first-place votes.  The Nuggets’ 57-25 regular-season record was the fourth-best in the NBA. As the league’s third-youngest team with an
average age of 24.9 years, Denver’s leading scorer, at 16.7
points per game, was Ty Lawson.  The Nuggets were beaten in six games by the Golden State
Warriors in the first round of the playoffs.  Karl is sixth on the NBA’s coaching victories list and the
active wins leader with a 1,131-756 record. He has gone 21
straight seasons without a losing mark, tying  Phil Jackson  for
the most in NBA history.  Karl, who turns 62 on May 12, was diagnosed with skin
cancer of the head and neck in February 2010. He overcame
prostate cancer in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
