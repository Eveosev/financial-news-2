Rwanda  will use part of the funds from
its debut dollar-bond sale to pay for the construction of a 28-
megawatt hydropower plant that will be fully operational by June
2014, Finance Minister Claver Gatete said.  The east African nation will add 14 megawatts of power by
December and the rest by June next year, he said in an interview
at the  World Economic Forum  for Africa in  Cape Town . The
remaining the money will be used for the construction of a hotel
and pay off some of state-owned RwandAir’s debt, he said.  “We didn’t just go to the market to look for any amount of
money -- we went for specific projects,” he said. “We have to
be very careful when we go to the market and defining what the
money will be used for.”  Rwanda, the site of a genocide that left 800,000 dead 20
years ago, sold $400 million of debt last month, joining African
nations from  Nigeria  to Senegal that are seeking to fund
infrastructure projects in the world’s second-fastest growing
region. Rwanda decided against selling more bonds after it
received about $3.5 billion in orders.  The country is open to selling more debt if it needs to
fund “high-impact” projects that are ready to be built in the
tourism and energy industries, Gatete said.  The yield on the 6.875 percent dollar bond due in May 2023
was little changed at 6.9 percent today. The nation’s credit
rating is B, five levels below investment grade, with a stable
outlook at  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
