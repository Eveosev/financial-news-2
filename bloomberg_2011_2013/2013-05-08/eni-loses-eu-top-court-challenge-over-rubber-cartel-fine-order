Eni SpA (ENI)  lost its appeal at the
European Union’s highest court against EU fines for colluding
with rivals to fix prices of synthetic rubber.  The EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg today rejected Eni’s
appeal and arguments that as a parent company it shouldn’t have
been held liable for the behavior of two subsidiaries. A parent
can be held liable especially where its unit “does not
autonomously determine its conduct on the market but mostly
applies the instructions given to it by the parent company,”
the court ruled.  The European Commission in 2006 fined five companies 519
million euros ($681.6 million) for rigging prices of synthetic
rubber in a cartel that lasted from at least 1996 to 2002.  Bayer
AG (BAYN)  escaped a fine after it tipped off the EU about the cartel. A
lower EU court in 2011 reduced the 272.2 million-euro fine
against Eni to 181.5 million euros. The EU top court today
upheld that ruling.  “Since the parent company and its subsidiary form, in the
present case, a single undertaking, the commission may impose
fines on the parent company without having to establish its
individual involvement in the infringement,” the court said
today in a statement.  Rome-based Eni declined to comment. The  shares  fell as much
as 0.5 percent and closed down 0.1 percent at 18.50 euros in
Milan.  The case is: C-508/11 P, ENI v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
