Robert Bosch GmbH , the biggest car-
part supplier, said it will begin selling the industry’s first
charging station for electric cars priced at less than $450.  The station, certified in the U.S. and Canada, will reduce
charging time by half, Bosch Automotive Service Solutions said
in an e-mailed statement. “For the foreseeable future most
electric vehicle drivers will primarily charge at home,” said
Tanvir Arfi, president of Bosch Automotive Service Solutions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
