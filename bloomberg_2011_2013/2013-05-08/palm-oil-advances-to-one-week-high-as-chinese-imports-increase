Palm oil  climbed to the highest level
in more than a week on rising demand from  China , the second-
largest importer, amid speculation that a delay in soybean
planting in the U.S. will lower global cooking oil supplies.  The contract for July delivery advanced as much as 1.5
percent to 2,294 ringgit ($771) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest price for the most-active
contract since April 30, and ended the morning session at 2,289
ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Futures, down 6.1 percent this year,
reached 2,230 ringgit on May 6, the lowest price since Dec. 13.  China imported 770,000 tons of vegetable oils in April, the
customs agency said. That compares with 700,000 tons in March
and 510,000 tons a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. Global
palm oil exports are forecast to climb to 43.6 million tons in
2012-2013 from 40.4 million tons in 2011-2012, Hamburg-based
researcher Oil World said yesterday.  Chinese purchases and gains in soybeans are boosting palm
oil, Donny Khor, deputy director of futures and commodities at
RHB Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur . “The
U.S. weather and the delay in soybean planting are also
supporting prices.”  About 2 percent of soybeans in the U.S. were planted as of
May 5, down from 22 percent last year and the five-year average
of 12 percent, the Department of Agriculture said. Farmers who
plant soybeans after collecting wheat may not be able to plant
oilseeds this year because of the harvest delays.  Soybeans for July delivery gained 0.5 percent to $13.8875 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil climbed 0.5
percent to 49.37 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for September delivery gained 1.4 percent
to 5,988  yuan  ($975) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
 Soybean oil  for same month delivery climbed 0.5 percent to 7,396
yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
