Tadawul, the Saudi Arabian benchmark
stock exchange, said it’s interested in expanding abroad and is
in talks with regional exchanges about integration.  “We’ve been in discussion with various exchanges in the
region and abroad and discussing the notion of joint products,
joint indexes,” Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Al-Suweilmy
said today in  Riyadh . “Some regional integration would make
sense and I have seen in recent months specifically that there
have been more serious discussions about integration in the
region.”  Saudi Arabia  only allows non-resident foreigners outside of
the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council to invest through equity
swaps and exchange-traded funds. The country is interested in
attracting more institutional investors to the stock market,
where retail traders account for most deals.  The Tadawul All Share Index has gained 5.9 percent this
year with about 160 listed companies trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
