Former Los Angeles Lakers coach  Phil Jackson  has told the Brooklyn Nets he isn’t interested in
becoming their head coach, ESPN reported, citing a person
familiar with the circumstances.  Interim coach P.J. Carlesimo was let go by the Nets on May
5, one day after they were eliminated by the Chicago Bulls in a
seven-game first-round National Basketball Association playoff
series.  Carlesimo, who replaced  Avery Johnson  on Dec. 27,
accumulated a 35-19 record and guided Brooklyn to the postseason
for the first time since 2007.  Jackson, 67, won a total of 11 NBA championships as coach
of the Chicago Bulls and Lakers.  The  Detroit Pistons  said last week that Jackson will be an
adviser for the team in its coaching search.  To contact the reporter on this story:
