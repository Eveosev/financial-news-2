The lira weakened against the dollar
and the euro after  Turkey ’s industrial production grew at the
weakest pace this year, missing analyst estimates.  The currency depreciated as output climbed 1.4 percent from
a year earlier, lagging the 3.3 percent median estimate of three
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Industrial production fell 0.9%
in March from the previous month after adjusting for work days
and seasonality, the statistics agency said in a statement today
from Ankara.  “The perception that the central bank will maintain its
interest rate cuts will strengthen after the less-than-expected
data,” Tufan Comert, a strategist at Garanti Securities in
Istanbul, wrote in an e-mailed note.  The lira depreciated as much as 0.1 percent to 1.7979 per
dollar, extending its loss this month to 0.3 percent. The
currency traded at 1.7960 per dollar at 12:01 p.m. in Istanbul.
It sank 0.3 percent against the euro to 2.3565.  Turkey’s central bank cut its one-week repo rate by 50
basis points to a record 5 percent on April 16 and also lowered
the overnight interest rates. The Monetary Policy Committee is
scheduled to meet on May 16.  Yields on two-year benchmark notes were unchanged at 5.12
percent, 10 basis points above a record-low on a closing basis
of 5.02 percent reached on May 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
