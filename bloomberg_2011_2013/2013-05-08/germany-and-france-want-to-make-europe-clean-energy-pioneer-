Germany  and France want to make Europe
a “pioneer continent” for the expansion of renewable energy
sources such as solar and wind, the countries’ environment
ministers said.  The nations are together developing a project related to
the energy switch, German Environment Minister  Peter Altmaier 
told reporters today in Berlin at a joint briefing with his
counterpart Delphine Batho. He didn’t give details.  German-French cooperation on energy “is closer than ever
before,” Altmaier said. “We’re determined to jointly lead in
the discussion over renewables in Europe and internationally.”  Germany is transforming its power market to more than
triple the share of renewables in the energy mix by 2050 while
phasing out nuclear generation. In France,  Electricite de France
SA ’s reactors provide three-quarters of the nation’s
electricity, a proportion President  Francois Hollande  has
promised to reduce to 50 percent by around 2025.  To contact the reporter on this story:
