Telekom Austria  AG, the country’s
biggest phone company, rose the most in almost five weeks after
its first-quarter earnings beat analysts’ estimates while a
decline in revenue was cushioned by business in Belarus.  The shares  climbed  as much as 3.6 percent in Vienna, the
biggest intraday rise since April 5, and traded 2 percent higher
at 5.25 euros at 10:45 a.m., the third-best performance in the
13-company Euro Stoxx Telecommunications Index. About 130,000
Telekom Austria shares traded, 26 percent of the average daily
volume over the past three months.  Key performance indicators for the first quarter “are not
looking as bad as expected in mobile and are better than our
rosy expectations in fixed,” Carola Bardelli and Matthew Bloxham, analysts for Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a note to
clients yesterday.  The stock may benefit from the results even as it is driven
mainly by this year’s spectrum auction as well as domestic
mobile prices, Bardelli and Bloxham said. Telekom Austria
introduced new tariffs last month in a bid to counter falling
prices in its domestic market.  The company, one of two European operators part-owned by
 Carlos Slim ’s  America Movil SAB (AMOV) , posted earnings before tax,
interest, depreciation and amortization of 336.9 million euros
($441.5 million) beating analysts’ average  estimate  of 323.8
million euros. Profit in Austria and  Bulgaria  declined on
intense competition and regulatory pressure, while earnings in
Belarus and smaller markets including Serbia and Slovenia rose,
the company said in a  statement  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
