Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.,
the world’s No. 2 bourse operator by market value, said first-
quarter profit was little changed as higher costs from owning
the London Metal Exchange offset gains.  Net income rose 1 percent to HK$1.16 billion ($149
million), or HK$1.01 a share, for the three months ended March
31, from HK$1.15 billion, or HK$1.06 a share, a year earlier,
the company said today in a statement. That compares with the
HK$1.1 billion mean  estimate  of six analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Equity trading on the Hong Kong bourse, which include
 China ’s biggest banks and energy producers, has trailed global
peers as Chinese economic data indicate growth may be slowing.
Hong Kong Exchanges completed its $2.2 billion acquisition of
the world’s biggest metal exchange in December as it seeks to
diversify revenue sources.  “The most important point the market is looking at is the
future development of the LME,”  Kenny Tang , general manager of
AMTD Financial Planning Ltd., who has a buy recommendation on
the stock, said before the statement. “The Hong Kong market
still has the ability to launch large listings, and fund flow
into Hong Kong remains quite strong. We are expecting some
improvements in turnover for the second half.”  Sales rose 19 percent in the first three months to HK$2.22
billion in the quarter, the company said. Operating expenses
surged 38 percent, the bourse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
