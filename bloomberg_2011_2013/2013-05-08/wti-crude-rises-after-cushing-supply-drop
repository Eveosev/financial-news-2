West Texas Intermediate crude rose to
a one-month high after supplies fell at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for the contract. Brent oil’s premium to WTI
shrank below $8 for the first time since January 2011.  Futures climbed 1 percent as the Energy Information
Administration said that  inventories  at the storage hub dropped
652,000 barrels to 49.1 million in the week ended May 3.
Nationwide stockpiles increased 230,000 barrels to 395.5
million. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index reached a record and
the euro advanced against the dollar.  “The Cushing number is showing that the market is finding
solutions to the bottleneck there,” said Adam Wise, who helps
manage a $6 billion oil and gas bond portfolio as a managing
director at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston . “The wide
spread between WTI and Brent gave companies the incentive to
find routes for the barrels.”  WTI crude for June delivery increased $1 to $96.62 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement
since April 2. The volume of all contracts traded was 30 percent
above the 100-day average at 3:52 p.m. Futures are up 5.2
percent this year.  Brent oil for June settlement dropped 6 cents to end the
session at $104.34 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume for all contracts was 35 percent above
the 100-day average.  WTI-Brent Spread  The European benchmark grade traded at a $7.72 premium to
WTI at settlement, down from $8.78 yesterday. The spread is at
the narrowest level based on closing prices since Jan. 20, 2011.  U.S. crude stockpiles were projected to increase 2 million
barrels, according to the median of 12 analyst responses in a
Bloomberg survey.  Refineries operated  at 87 percent of capacity last week, up
2.6 percentage points from the seven days ended April 26 and the
highest level since January. Units are often reopened in the
spring after being idled for maintenance in late winter as
attention moves away from heating oil and before the peak season
for U.S. gasoline consumption, which runs from late May until
early September.  “Crude supplies didn’t grow anywhere near as much as we
expected, but we aren’t too concerned because there’s an
explanation,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market
research at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“Refinery utilization grew an impressive 2.6 percentage points
last week, so we know where the crude’s going.”  U.S. Output  Crude  output  rose 57,000 barrels a day to 7.37 million, the
highest level since February 1992, EIA data show. U.S.
production has surged as the combination of horizontal drilling
and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies
trapped in shale formations in the central part of the country.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  advanced as much as 0.4 percent to a record
1,632.47 as of 3:52 p.m. in New York. The euro strengthened as
much as 0.9 percent against the dollar after German industrial
output unexpectedly increased in March, a sign that  Europe ’s
largest economy is returning to growth. A stronger common
currency bolsters the appeal of commodities denominated in the
dollar as an investment.  “U.S. crude production continues to rise, which has left
us with extremely robust supplies,” Wise said. “Equity markets
are strong, which in the long run will be positive for energy
demand. It seems oil is moving more on overall market sentiment
than inventories today.”  Seaway Pipeline  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  switched
the direction of the Seaway crude pipeline last year to move
barrels from Cushing to the Houston area. The link may average
throughput of about 295,000 barrels a day through May, up from a
February average of 272,000 barrels, according to a filing with
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Seaway is operating below capacity because of limited
offtake capability at the end of the line, which won’t be
repaired until next year. The pipeline’s capacity was expanded
to 400,000 barrels a day on Jan. 11.  Iraq ’s crude exports via a pipeline to  Turkey  were halted
because of sabotage bombing overnight,  Asim Jihad , a spokesman
for the Iraqi oil ministry, said by telephone from  Baghdad .
Exports will resume tomorrow, he said. Iraq, the largest
producer in the OPEC after Saudi Arabia, exports the bulk of its
oil by sea from terminals in the country’s south.  WTI will average $93.17 a barrel this year, down 75 cents
from the April projection of $93.92, the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, said yesterday in its monthly
Short-Term  Energy Outlook . Brent will average $105.89 in 2013,
down $2.07 from last month’s prediction.  Global Production  Oil production outside the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will rise 2.1 percent to 53.85 million
barrels a day in 2013, led by gains in the U.S. and  Canada ,
according to the EIA. U.S. output will climb 14 percent to 7.42
million barrels a day, the EIA said.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 19.3 percent, down from 21.8 percent yesterday.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 633,743
contracts as of 3:53 p.m. It totaled 579,430 contracts
yesterday, 0.4 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.77 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
