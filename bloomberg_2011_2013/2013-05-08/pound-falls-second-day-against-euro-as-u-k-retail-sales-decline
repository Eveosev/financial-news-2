The pound rose the most in almost two
weeks against the dollar amid speculation that the Bank of
England will refrain from increasing its monetary stimulus at
the end of a two-day policy meeting tomorrow.  Sterling advanced against most of its 16 most major peers
after Lloyds Banking Group Plc’s Halifax unit said that  house
prices  rose in April more than economists predicted. The central
bank’s Monetary Policy Committee will keep the target for its
program of bond purchases known as quantitative easing at 375
billion pounds ($584 billion), according to all but one of 44
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Gilts rose as the U.K. sold
30-year inflation-linked securities at a record-low yield.  “I certainly see further sterling strength,” said Michael Hewson, a market analyst at CMC Markets Plc in London. “It’s
very unlikely the Bank of England will do any further
quantitative easing between now and the third quarter. I don’t
see too much downside in it.”  Sterling gained 0.5 percent to $1.5563 at 5:03 p.m.  London 
time after climbing as much as 0.7 percent, the most since April
25. The pound fell 0.2 percent to 84.65 pence per euro.  The pound may climb to $1.58 in the next few weeks if it
manages to stay above $1.5410, Hewson said.  Minutes of the central bank’s meeting will be published on
May 22. In April, King and two other MPC members wanted to
increase QE and were outvoted by a majority on the nine-member
panel.  Home values rose 1.1 percent from March, when they
increased by a revised 0.4 percent, Halifax said. The median
prediction of 11 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for prices
to gain 0.2 percent.  Retail Sales  Sterling advanced against the dollar even as a report
showed retail sales dropped last month, highlighting that the
recovery is still uneven.  Sales at stores open at least 12 months, measured by value,
dropped 2.2 percent in April from a year earlier, the British
Retail Consortium said. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a gain of 1.9 percent.  The U.K. currency has strengthened 2.1 percent in the past
month, the best performer of 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, as data from
gross domestic product growth to construction output boosted
bets the economy is recovering. The dollar fell 0.3 percent,
while the euro gained 1.2 percent.  “The BRC retail sales monitor was disappointing and broke
the recent cycle of encouraging news for the economy,” Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and institutional
treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in London, wrote in an e-
mailed report. “The slightly lower number hasn’t particularly
hurt sterling for now.”  Record Yield  The 10-year gilt yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.77 percent after rising to 1.81 percent
yesterday, the highest since March 26. The 1.75 percent
securities due September 2022 rose 0.15, or 1.50 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 99.82.  The Debt Management Office sold 1.1 billion pounds of
inflation-linked bonds maturing in 2044 at a so-called real
yield of minus 0.234 percent, the  lowest  since Bloomberg started
compiling the data in 2006.  Demand for the securities has been supported as investors
boosted bets that consumer price increases will accelerate as
the Bank of England focuses on boosting the economy.  Britain’s 30-year  break-even rate , a gauge of expectations
of inflation derived from a difference in yields between gilts
and index-linked securities, increased one basis point to 3.38
percentage points. It earlier reached 3.39 percentage points,
the most since April 12.  Gilts returned 1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
0.5 percent and Treasuries rose 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
