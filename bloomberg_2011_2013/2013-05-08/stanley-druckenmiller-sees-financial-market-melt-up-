Stanley Druckenmiller , the billionaire
hedge-fund manager who returned an average of 30 percent a year
from 1986 through 2010, said the long rally by commodities is
over as China switches to consumption-led growth rather than
investing in infrastructure.  “We think a decade of commodity demand is over,” he said
today at the Ira Sohn Investment Conference in New York. “It’s
a poisonous cocktail when you look at commodities going
forward.”  Druckenmiller, who said in August 2010 that he was
returning cash to his clients and would focus on his own
investments, is betting against the Australian dollar, which he
said will “come down and come down hard.”  Financial markets will continue their rally, Druckenmiller
said, even as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  runs
“the most inappropriate monetary policy in the world.”  “Over the short term I see a melt-up,” he said. “There
are no conditions currently for a major  bear market .”  Druckenmiller, 59, said his largest stock holding is  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  and that he couldn’t imagine “a better steal.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
