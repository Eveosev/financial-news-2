Hall of Fame defensive tackle “Mean”
Joe Greene retired from the Pittsburgh Steelers after a playing
career and coaching and front-office stints that totaled 27
years and six  Super Bowls  with the franchise.  “There are very few people in the history of the NFL who
have had a greater impact on one franchise than Joe Greene has
had on the Pittsburgh Steelers,” club President Art Rooney II
said in a statement on the team’s  website .  Greene, 66, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame
in 1987 after playing with the Steelers from 1969 to 1981, the
season before the  National Football League  began keeping sack
records.  Greene worked as a color analyst for  CBS Sports  before
becoming Pittsburgh’s defensive line coach from 1987 to 1991. He
held the same job with the Miami Dolphins and  Arizona  Cardinals
before returning to Pittsburgh in 2004, where he’s been a
special assistant for pro and college personnel under General
Manager Kevin Colbert.  “The people were very important to me, brought me along
and made me feel comfortable, and I thought we made a pretty
good team together,” Greene said in a statement. “The people
that I was working with made it all good for me -- made it
important to me -- made it special.”  The Steelers, six-time Super Bowl winners, won four with
Greene at defensive tackle and the other two with him as a
member of the team’s front office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
