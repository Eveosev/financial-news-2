A unit of  Warren Buffett ’s MidAmerican
Energy Holdings Co. plans to invest $1.9 billion to build
additional wind farms in Iowa that would increase its wind
generating capacity in the state by about half.  MidAmerican Energy Co., Iowa’s largest utility, plans to
build as much as 1,050 megawatts of new wind power plants in the
state, adding to about 2,285 megawatts of projects that it
already owns and operates, the Des Moines, Iowa-based company
said today in a statement on its website.  MidAmerican is the largest U.S. owner of wind generation
capacity among rate-regulated utilities, according to the
statement. Iowa ranks third in the U.S. for states with the most
wind generating capacity, behind Texas and California, according
to the American Wind Energy Association.  The projects may include as many as 656 new  wind turbines 
and be completed by the end of 2015, and the proposal requires
approval from the Iowa Utilities Board, according to the
statement.  MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. is a subsidiary of
Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   To contact the reporter on this story:
