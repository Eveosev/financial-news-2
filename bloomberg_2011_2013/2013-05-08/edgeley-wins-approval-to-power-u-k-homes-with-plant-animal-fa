Edgeley Green Power Ltd. won approval
for a U.K. plant that will generate enough electricity from
waste vegetable oil and animal fat to power 18,000 homes.  Adur District Council gave the go-ahead to build the 32-
megawatt power plant, the Alton-based company said today in  a
statement  on its website. The project will cost about 20 million
pounds ($31 million), while construction should begin by the end
of the year and the facility start operating in early 2015.  The project will contribute to Britain’s goal of getting 15
percent of its energy from renewables by 2020. Facilities using
organic matter such as food and agricultural waste to generate
power may meet 8 percent to 11 percent of the U.K.’s primary
energy demand within eight years, according to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
