Taiwan’s stocks  rose, driving the
benchmark index to a 21-month high, as  Acer Inc. (2353)  led a rally for
technology companies after earnings beat analysts’ estimates.  Acer, the island’s largest PC maker by shipments, surged
2.3 percent after it reported first-quarter net income of NT$515
million. Chip designer  MediaTek Inc. (2454)  climbed to the highest
level in more than 2 years after reporting April sales
increased.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) , the biggest
contributor to the benchmark Taiwan Taiex index’s gain today,
surged to a record after the Economic Daily News said the
company’s gross margin may reach 50 percent in the second half.  “The outlook for companies, especially blue chips, is
quite good for the second quarter and this is boosting
investors’ confidence,” Barry Chen, a fund manager at Union
Securities Investment Trust Co., said in a phone interview from
Taipei today.  The Taiex index jumped 1.3 percent to 8,267.09 at the
close, the highest level since Aug. 4, 2011. Trading volume was
31 percent higher than the 30-day average for that time of day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
