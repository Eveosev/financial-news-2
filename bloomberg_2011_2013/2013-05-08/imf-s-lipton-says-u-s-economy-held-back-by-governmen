U.S. economic growth would reach as
much as 4 percent if it weren’t held back by an underperforming
government sector, said  David Lipton , the First Deputy Managing
Director of the  International Monetary Fund .  “The private sector is actually recovering really
strongly,” Lipton said today in a speech in Pretoria, South
Africa’s capital. “The public sector is providing some drag on
growth. Right now the growth rate is 2, but it would be much
higher -- 3, maybe 3.5 or 4 -- if there wasn’t this drag from
the public sector.”  Low  interest rates  and several rounds of debt purchases by
the  Federal Reserve , known as quantitative easing, have helped
maintain growth in the U.S. economy and have been good for
global growth, Lipton said.  The Federal Open Market Committee said last week will keep
buying $85 billion in bonds each month, expanding its balance
sheet to help spur economic growth and bolster employment. The
world’s biggest economy expanded at a 2.5 percent annualized
rate in the first quarter, trailing the 3 percent gain that was
the median estimate of 86 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “There’s probably limited ability for monetary policy to
spur the economy further, but it’s played a very positive
role,” Lipton said.  The European Union needs to fix flaws in its banking
“architecture” and should introduce a banking insurance fund
for the whole region, he said. The IMF doesn’t see  Europe 
returning to economic growth before late this year, Lipton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
