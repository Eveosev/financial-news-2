Portugal ’s three biggest publicly
banks’ combined sovereign debt holdings rose 16 percent in the
first quarter, according to filings by the lenders.  The holdings rose to 22 billion euros ($28.9 billion),
compared with 18.9 billion euros at the end of December, the
filings show.  Portugal’s first sale of 10-year bonds since its bailout in
2011 yesterday attracted demand for more than three times the
amount the government was seeking to raise. The sale took place
as yields on the country’s existing 10-year securities are at
the lowest since 2010.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA, the country’s second-biggest
listed bank by market value, held 9.3 billion euros of sovereign
debt, rising from 8.1 billion euros at the end of the year. The
bank increased holdings of Portuguese sovereign debt to 5.9
billion euros, of which 2.2 billion euros were treasury bills,
Oporto, Northern Portugal-based Banco Comercial said May 6 in a
filing.  Banco Espirito Santo SA, Portugal’s biggest publicly traded
bank in market value, owned 6.8 billion euros of sovereign debt
at the end of March, the bank said yesterday in a filing. That’s
a 74 percent increase from its portfolio at the end of 2012,
when it held 3.9 billion euros in sovereign debt.  Espirito Santo holds 4 billion euros in Portuguese debt,
including 1.1 billion euros in treasury bills. The lender also
holds Spanish, Italian and Irish sovereign debt, mostly short-
term debt, the bank said.  Banco BPI SA  had 5.9 billion euros of Portuguese, Irish
and Italian sovereign debt at the end of March, the bank said
last month. That’s less than the 6.9 billion euros held at the
end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
