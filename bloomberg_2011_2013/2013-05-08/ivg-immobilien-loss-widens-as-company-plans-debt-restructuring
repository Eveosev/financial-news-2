IVG Immobilien AG (IVG) , the German company
that plans to restructure 4 billion euros ($5 billion) of debt,
said its first-quarter loss widened as the value of its
properties fell.  The net loss swelled to 45.1 million euros from 4.6 million
euros a year earlier, the company said in a statement today. The
value of IVG’s properties dropped by 42.5 million euros.  IVG, once  Germany ’s largest commercial property company by
market value, has shed about 96 percent of its share price since
2008 following a series of writedowns in its property values and
difficulties repaying debt. The company and its funds own
commercial properties valued at 21 billion euros, including a
stake in  London ’s Gherkin tower, according to the 2012 annual
report.  IVG is working on a plan to restructure all of its debt,
which it will present at its annual shareholders meeting on Aug.
14, the company said today.  The company must repay 3.2 billion euros of debt due by the
end of 2014, which it borrowed to finance operations and
property acquisitions, according to its annual report.  On March 27, IVG shares had their biggest-ever decline in
Frankfurt trading after the company said it needs to restructure
its finances. At the same time IVG reported a 2012 net loss of
98.7 million euros and said its loan-to-value ratio of 70.6
percent, a measure of indebtedness, was higher than planned.  The company is seeking additional investors in the fund
that owns half of the Gherkin after lenders demanded that IVG
reduce the debt used to purchase the building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
