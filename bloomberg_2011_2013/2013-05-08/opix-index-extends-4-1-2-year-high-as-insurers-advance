Japan ’s  Topix Index (TPX)  advanced for a
second day to its highest since September 2008 as NGK Spark Plug
Co. and Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. climbed on earnings and
 China ’s export growth unexpectedly accelerated.  Tokio Marine jumped 4.7 percent after the casualty insurer
beat analysts’ profit estimates. NGK Spark Plug rose 7.1 percent
after forecasting operating profit that topped estimates.
 Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305) , which gets 16 percent of
sales in China, advanced 5.6 percent.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  surged 6.3
percent after media reports the unprofitable TV maker will get
an increased credit line from lenders and supply screens for
Apple Inc.’s new iPhone.  The Topix added 0.5 percent to close at 1,194.34 in Tokyo,
with nine stocks rising for every seven that fell. The gauge
yesterday gained 3.1 percent, the most in a month, to recoup
losses from the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.7 percent to 14,285.69
today.  “China’s trade data is giving an extra boost to the market
because nobody expected much,” said Takashi Ito, an equity
strategist at Nomura Securities Co., Japan’s biggest brokerage.
“You can’t deny that overall earnings results have been good.”  Of the 339 companies on the Topix that have reported  full-year earnings  since April 1, and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 197 beat analysts’ projections.  Sony Corp. (6758)  and Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co. are among more than 600 companies on the
measure scheduled to post results in the next three days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s broadest share gauge rallied 65 percent since mid-November, making it the world’s best-performing major stock
index, amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will beat
deflation. The Topix yesterday traded at 1.3 times book value,
compared with 2.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.7
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  NGK Rises  A gauge of glass and ceramic makers rose the most among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups, as NGK Spark Plug forecast full-year
operating profit would increase 60 percent to 38 billion yen
($387 million), higher than the average analyst estimate of 33.3
billion yen. Shares of the supplier to  Toyota (7203)  Motor Corp.
climbed 7.1 percent to 1,759 yen.  Toyota, reporting results after the market’s close,
forecast annual profit below estimates amid slumping demand in
China. Net income may increase 42 percent to 1.37 trillion yen,
lagging behind the 1.42 trillion yen average of analyst
projections compiled by Bloomberg. The stock added 1.4 percent
to 5,840 yen today.  Insurers Gain  Insurers had the second-biggest gain among Topix subgroups.
Tokio Marine advanced 4.7 percent to 3,250 yen after reporting
net income of 129 billion yen, beating the average analyst
estimate of 114 billion yen, citing gains on shareholdings and
improved overseas businesses.  Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Co., Japan’s second-biggest
insurer, rose 1.6 percent to 133,400 yen. T&D Holdings Inc., a
life insurer, gained 1.7 percent to 1,144 yen.  Japanese shares also climbed after China’s exports rose
14.7 percent, above the 9.2 percent median forecast of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Imports advanced 16.8 percent, while
the trade surplus of $18.2 billion was higher than projected.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction machinery maker that depends
on China for almost 10 percent of its sales, rose 4.4 percent to
2,728 yen. Hitachi Construction climbed 5.6 percent to 2,425
yen.  Rakuten Inc. soared 11 percent to 1,257 yen, the highest
since December 2004, after Deutsche Bank AG recommended buying
the shares of the online shopping site. The bank said a shift to
domestic demand from exports will boost Rakuten’s presence.
Sharp advanced 6.3 percent to 369 yen after the Nikkei reported
the display maker will get a credit line of 150 billion yen from
lenders. The company will make screens for the iPhone starting
next month, the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper said.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index rose 4.1 percent
to 25.77, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.4 percent
on the benchmark gauge during the next 30 days.  Futures of the S&P 500 were little changed today. The
measure yesterday extended its record level for a fourth
straight day, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above
15,000 for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
