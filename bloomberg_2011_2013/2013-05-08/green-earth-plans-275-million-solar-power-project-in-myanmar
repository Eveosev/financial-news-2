Green Earth Power ( Thailand ) Co. Ltd.,
a privately-held company in Thailand, plans to invest about $275
million on a new solar power project in  Myanmar .  The facility, located in Minbu city, 500 kilometers (311
miles) north of Yangon, will have generating capacity of 210
megawatts, Supasit Skontanarak, Green Earth’s managing director,
said by phone from Bangkok today. The project will be completed
within two years, he said.  President  Thein Sein , who took office two years ago, is
clearing the way for overseas investment in Myanmar to help
speed modernization of its financial system and infrastructure
ahead of elections in 2015. U.S. and European companies
including  Ford Motor Co. (F) , Coca-Cola Co. and  Unilever NV (UNA)  are
scouting for opportunities in Myanmar after the Southeast Asian
nation began enhancing economic and political ties with Western
nations.  “Myanmar has tremendous potential as large population and
investment inflows increase the development need for basic
infrastructure including electricity-generating facilities,”
said Supasit.  Green Earth plans to finance 70 percent of the project with
bank loans, said Supasit, whose family holds the Bangkok-based
company’s majority stake. The company is in talks with Thai and
overseas lenders, he said.  Green Earth signed a memorandum of understanding with
Myanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power last week to develop the
project, said Supasit. The new plants will sell electricity to
the Myanmar government for 30 years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
