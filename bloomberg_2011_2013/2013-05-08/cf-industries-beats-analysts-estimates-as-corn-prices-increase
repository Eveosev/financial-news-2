CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF) , the
largest U.S. maker of nitrogen fertilizer, reported first-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates as corn prices
rose.  Net income climbed to $406.5 million, or $6.47 a share,
from $368.4 million, or $5.54, a year earlier, the Deerfield,
Illinois-based company said today in a statement. Profit
excluding one-time items was $6.03 a share, topping the $6
average of 14  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined to
$1.34 billion from $1.53 billion, less than the $1.44 billion
average estimate.  Corn futures in  Chicago  were on average 11 percent higher
in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, generating
more cash for farmers to buy fertilizer, after the worst U.S.
drought in 70 years ravaged crops last year. That may support
prices for crop nutrients, which have been falling in the past
year, said Jason Miner, a Princeton, New Jersey-based analyst
at Bloomberg Industries.  “We may be seeing evidence of less pricing pressure than
people expected,” Miner said before the results were released.  The company’s adjusted per-share earnings have  beaten 
average analysts’ estimates in eight of the past nine quarters.  ( CF Industries  scheduled a conference call for tomorrow at
10 a.m.  New York  time at +1-877-280-4959 or +1-857-244-7316. The
