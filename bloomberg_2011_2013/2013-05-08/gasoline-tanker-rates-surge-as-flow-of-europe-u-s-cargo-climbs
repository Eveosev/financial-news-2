Rates for tankers to ship European
gasoline to the U.S. surged as the amount of cargoes booked for
the trade jumped.  Costs measured in industry standard Worldscale terms gained
14 percent to 167.92 points for voyages to New York from
Rotterdam, according to data from the Baltic Exchange in  London .
The vessels’ earnings increased 33 percent to $19,410 a day,
according to the bourse’s calculations.  “Tight supply of ships for prompt loading on the continent
and an influx of fresh cargo inquiry proved a potent
combination,” Thomas Teigland, a tanker broker at Fearnleys A/S
in Oslo specializing in gasoline shipments, said by e-mail
today. “As the cargoes kept coming, owners’ confidence
improved.”  Oil traders boosted the number of tankers they booked to
ship European gasoline to the U.S. in the past week, according
to a survey of shipbrokers. They already hired or plan to hire
33 Medium Range tankers on the Rotterdam-to-New York trade route
for loading in the next two weeks, according to a survey of four
shipbrokers and one trader yesterday and today. That compares
with 21 charters in the corresponding survey on April 30.  The increase in rates is the biggest since Jan. 4. The
Worldscale system reflects dollars-a-ton freight costs on
thousands of different trade routes. Those flat rates change at
the start of each year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
