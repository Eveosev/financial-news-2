The  San Francisco 49ers  and  Levi
Strauss  & Co. reached a 20-year, $220 million agreement to name
the National Football League team’s stadium under construction
in Santa Clara for the world’s biggest maker of jeans.  The apparel maker is proposing to name the $1.2 billion
facility Levi’s Stadium, in a move that Chief Executive Chip Bergh said will allow the company to reach sports and music fans
from the area and around the world.  “Levi’s Stadium will connect two iconic Bay Area brands
that share similar values,” Bergh said in a news release posted
today on the team’s website.  The company will present the proposal on May 9 to the Santa
Clara Stadium Authority, the public agency overseeing
construction of the building, which is scheduled to open in
2014.  Jed York, the team’s chief executive, said “49ers have
worn Levi’s jeans since the Gold Rush era,” when the company
created the first blue jeans by adding copper rivets to denim
pants. The 49ers, the first major league sports team based in
San Francisco in 1946, have won five Super Bowl titles.  About 300,000 people flocked to California after gold was
discovered there in 1848. They became known as 49ers and the
California Gold Rush lasted until  1855. (AL185)   To contact the reporter on this story:
