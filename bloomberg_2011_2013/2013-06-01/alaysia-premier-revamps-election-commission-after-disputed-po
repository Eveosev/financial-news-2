Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak
announced measures to overhaul the election commission after the
ruling coalition retained power in a vote that was marred by
fraud allegations.  An independent bipartisan parliamentary committee of
government and opposition members will oversee the commission to
“strengthen public confidence” in it, Najib said today in a
statement in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, near Kuala
Lumpur.  Najib’s Barisan Nasional alliance won 133 seats in the 222-member Parliament in the May 5 election to extend its 55-year
rule over the Southeast Asian nation. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has disputed the outcome and said May 6 that his Pakatan
Rakyat group would challenge some of the results because of
fraud claims.  Monitoring groups such as the Coalition for Clean and Fair
Elections, known as Bersih, raised several “major issues,”
including the use of phantom voters, stained ballot papers and
indelible ink that could be washed off, according to their
preliminary report.  “It is so easy to take the path of blame and denial, but
this will not solve any of our problems or unlock the challenges
facing  Malaysia ,” Najib said. “I am announcing these
improvements to our electoral system in the spirit of unity and
national reconciliation.  The authorities will announce ‘‘in due course’’ details of
a plan to address corruption and improve government services,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
