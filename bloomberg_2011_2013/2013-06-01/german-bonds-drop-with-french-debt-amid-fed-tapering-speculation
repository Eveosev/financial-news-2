German  government bonds  declined for
a second week, with  10-year (GFRN10)  yields rising to a three-month high,
as concern the  Federal Reserve  will begin reducing stimulus
measures dented the appeal of fixed-income assets.  French and Belgian securities also dropped as bonds around
the world were set for the worst month in almost a decade.
Italian 10-year bond yields rose less than those of their German
peers after the nation sold 5.75 billion euros ($7.47 billion)
of debt maturing in 2018 and 2023. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said last week that the central bank could reduce record
stimulus if the economy shows sustained improvement.  “The key issue is the current debate about whether the Fed
will get ahead of the curve in withdrawing quantitative
easing,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income strategist
at Rabobank International in London. “Liquidity is the key
driver. The risk is the Fed is going to get ahead of itself.”  Germany’s  10-year yield  climbed seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, this week to 1.51 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday. The yield increased to 1.55 percent on May 29,
the most since Feb. 25. The 1.5 percent bond due in May 2023
fell 0.68, or 6.80 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.96.  French 10-year yields increased 13 basis points this week
to 2.07 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Belgian debt
rose 14 basis points to 2.24 percent.  Italian Bonds  Italian bonds outperformed their German peers as the nation
met its target amount at a debt auction on May 30, signaling
demand for the securities had picked up despite losses last
month.  The nation auctioned 3 billion euros of bonds due in May
2023 as investors bid for 1.38 times the amount of securities
allotted, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 1.42
on April 29. Investors also bought 2.75 billion euros of 2018
securities, as well as 3.49 billion euros of zero-coupon and
inflation-linked debt at separate sales on May 28.  The yield on Italian  10-year debt  was at 4.16 percent
yesterday, two basis points higher than on May 24. The rate
climbed to 4.23 percent before the May 30 auctions, the highest
since April 19. The yield difference, or spread, between the
securities and similar-maturity German bonds fell five basis
points to 2.65 percentage points this week.  The  European Central Bank  will keep its benchmark  interest
rate  at a  record-low  0.5 percent when it meets on June 6,
according to 54 of 56 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Two
strategists predict the bank will cut rates by 25 basis points.  France is selling debt due in 2020, 2023 and 2027 next
week, while  Spain , Germany and  Austria  also auction bonds.  German government bonds handed investors a loss of 1.5
percent last month through May 30, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish securities lost 1.2 percent and Italian debt
declined 0.5 percent.  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Index fell 1.4 percent last month through May 30,
poised for the steepest loss since April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
