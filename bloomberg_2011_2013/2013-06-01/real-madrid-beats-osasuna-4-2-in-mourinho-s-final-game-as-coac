Real Madrid defeated Osasuna 4-2 in
Jose Mourinho’s final game as coach of the record nine-time
European soccer champion.  Gonazalo Higuain,  Michael Essien ,  Karim Benzema  and Jose
Callejon scored for Real, will finish in second place in La Liga
behind rival Barcelona.  Mourinho announced last week he would leave at the end of
his third season in Spain. The Portuguese at the time called his
final trophy-less campaign a failure.  Real relinquished the Spanish league title to Barcelona,
lost to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League semifinals and
fell to  Atletico Madrid  in the Copa del Rey final.  Mourinho has been linked with a move back to Chelsea, which
he led to two English Premier League titles in a three-year
stint through Sept. 2007. The Sun newspaper reported two days
ago that he’s signed a four-year contract worth 40 million
pounds ($61 million) to return to the west  London  club.  Mourinho guided Real to last year’s La Liga title, ending a
three-year streak by Barcelona, which regained the championship
this season with four games to spare.  He also led the club to three straight Champions League
semifinals. Real hadn’t reached the quarterfinals of Europe’s
elite club competition since the 2003-04 season before he
arrived.  Higuain and Essien gave Real a 2-0 halftime lead before
Osasuna’s Roberto Torres and Alvaro Cejudo tied the score after
the break. Benzema put Real back on top in the 69th minute and
Callejon clinched the victory with three minutes remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
