Former National Basketball
Association player Mookie Blaylock was critically injured in a
head-on collision which left a woman dead in Jonesboro,  Georgia ,
12 miles south of Atlanta, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reported.  Blaylock, 46, was driving a Cadillac Escalade when he
crossed the median and hit a vehicle carrying two people, the
newspaper said, citing Jonesboro police Chief Franklin Allen.  Blaylock was removed from life support late last night and
was listed in guarded and critical condition, Allen said,
according to the newspaper. A family member told police he was
being treated for seizures.  Monica Murphy, 40, a passenger in the second vehicle, died
at Atlanta Medical Center. The driver wasnâ€™t seriously injured,
the newspaper said.  Blaylock, a point guard, played 13 seasons in the NBA,
ending his career with averages of 13.5 points, 4.1 rebounds,
6.7 assists and 2.3 steals per game. He played for the  New
Jersey Nets  from 1989 to 1992 when he joined the Hawks until
1999. He was traded to the  Golden State Warriors  where he played
for three seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
