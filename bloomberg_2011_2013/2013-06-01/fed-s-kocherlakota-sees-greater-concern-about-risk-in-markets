President Narayana Kocherlakota said he sees changes in asset
markets since 2007 including greater concern about risk that may
reverse “only slowly.”  Borrowing constraints have tightened and the supply of what
are considered safe assets has declined, Kocherlakota said today
in slides prepared for a speech in Istanbul.  U.S. central bankers are trying to understand shifts in
financial markets and the economy following a housing crash that
led to the worst recession since the 1930s. The Fed has kept
interest rates near zero since December 2008 and has expanded
its balance sheet to more than  $3.3 trillion  to support the
recovery.  The supply of what are considered risk-free assets has
shrunk because sovereign debt has become riskier and U.S.
property values are lower, the Fed district bank chief said.
More research is needed on how nominal wages respond to an
excess amount of labor, said Kocherlakota, who doesn’t vote on
the Federal Open Market Committee this year.  The slides released today don’t include a discussion on the
outlook for monetary policy or the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
