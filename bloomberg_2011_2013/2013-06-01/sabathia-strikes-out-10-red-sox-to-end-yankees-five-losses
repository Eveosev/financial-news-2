C.C. Sabathia struck out 10 to tie
his season-high as the New York Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox
4-1 to break a five-game losing streak, their longest of this
Major League Baseball season.  Sabathia (5-4) allowed one run on six hits in 7 1/3 innings,
while  Mariano Rivera  got his 19th save after striking out one
and giving up two hits in the ninth inning last night at Yankee
Stadium.  Sabathia tallied his 36th career game with at least 10
strikeouts, and his 17th as a Yankee to tie Al Downing for third
in franchise history. His fifth-inning strikeout of David Ross
was the 889th for the Yankees, surpassing David Cone’s 888 and
putting him alone in 17th place on the team’s all-time list.  The win elevated New York (31-23) to one game behind the
American East-leading Red Sox (33-23).  Jayson Nix and Ichiro Suzuki each hit run-scoring singles
in the second inning to give the Yankees a 2-0 lead.  Kevin Youkilis, playing in his first game off the disabled
list, sent Suzuki home on a single in the fifth for a 3-0
advantage. Youkilis, who was 1-for-4 last night, went on the
disabled list April 30 with a back sprain.  Brett Gardner  added a run-scoring single to center in the
seventh after  Mike Napoli  doubled to score  Dustin Pedroia  for
the Red Sox’s only run.  Mark Teixeira  also returned to the roster after injuring
his right wrist on March 5. He was 0-for-3 with a walk.  The Yankees are still without shortstop  Derek Jeter , third
baseman Alex Rodriguez, left fielder Curtis Granderson and
catcher Francisco Cervelli.  Jon Lester (6-2) surrendered four runs on six hits and
struck out five in 6 1/3 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
