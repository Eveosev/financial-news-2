Bayern Munich defeated Stuttgart 3-2
in the German Cup soccer final to claim its third trophy of the
season.  Mario Gomez scored two goals and Thomas Mueller added one
for Bayern, which also won the Bundesliga and Champions League
titles. Bayern’s the first German team to win its league
championship, domestic cup and European Cup in the same season.  The final at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin was Jupp
Heynckes’s last game as Bayern coach. Heynckes, 68, will retire
when his contract expires at the end of this month and will be
replaced by former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
