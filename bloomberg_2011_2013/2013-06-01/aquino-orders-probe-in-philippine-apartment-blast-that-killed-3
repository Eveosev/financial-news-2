Philippines President  Benigno Aquino 
ordered an investigation into an explosion at an  Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) 
apartment in  Manila  that caused three deaths.  Yesterday’s blast in a fifth-floor unit at Two Serendra, a
residential building in a business district of Taguig City
caused a slab of concrete to fall on to a passing delivery van,
fatally crushing three people, Ayala Land said in a statement.
The cause was still unknown and the authorities are
investigating, according to statement from Ayala, the nation’s
biggest builder.  Aquino described  the explosion as “unusual,” Mar Roxas,
the president’s interior and local government secretary, told a
briefing broadcast on local radio today. Ten units on the fifth
floor of Two Serendra were damaged and residents of the
apartment were evacuated,  Ayala Land  said.  “We don’t know if this was caused by a bomb, an accident
or by a combustion of chemicals,” Roxas said. “This is
unusual. The president was concerned, that’s why he came.”  The incident shook nearby buildings, shattering some
windows, ABS-CBN News reported on its website.  Ayala Land said it’s cooperating fully with the
authorities. The company rose 3.1 percent in Manila trading
yesterday, exceeding the 1 percent advance of the Philippine
Stock Exchange Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
