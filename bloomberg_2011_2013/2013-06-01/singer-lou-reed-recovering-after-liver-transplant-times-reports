Lou Reed, the U.S. songwriter and
vocalist with the Velvet Underground, is recovering after
undergoing a liver transplant last month, the London-based Times
said, citing an interview with his musician wife Laurie
Anderson.  “It’s as serious as it gets,” Anderson tells the
newspaper. “He was dying. You don’t get it for fun.”  She said Reed is on the road to recovery following the
life-saving surgery at the Mayo Clinic,  Cleveland .  “I don’t think he’ll ever totally recover from this, but
he’ll be back to doing things in a few months,” the Times cited
Anderson as saying. “I’m very happy. It’s a new life for him.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
