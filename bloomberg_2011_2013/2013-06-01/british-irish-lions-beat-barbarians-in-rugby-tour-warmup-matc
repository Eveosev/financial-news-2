The British and Irish Lions beat the
Barbarians 59-8 in Hong Kong in a tuneup for their nine-match
rugby tour of Australia.  The game was the first in Asia for the Lions, a team of
players from the U.K. and Ireland that tours Australia,  New
Zealand  or South Africa every four years. The Lions travel to
Perth tomorrow ahead of their Australia opener against the
Western Force Super Rugby team on June 5.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
