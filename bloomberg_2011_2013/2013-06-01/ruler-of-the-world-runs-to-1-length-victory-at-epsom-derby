Ruler of the World made a late charge
to win the Epsom Derby, giving jockey  Ryan Moore  his second
victory in Britain’s richest horse race.  Ruler of the World, at 7-1 odds, overtook Battle of Marengo
in the home stretch, then held off a late challenge from
Libertarian to win the 1 1/2-mile race for 3-year-olds by 1 1/2
lengths at Epsom Downs in Surrey, south of  London .  “I’m very lucky to be in this position and riding good
horses,” Moore, who won the Derby aboard Workforce in 2010,
told Britain’s Channel 4. “It’s the most important race and
it’s a very special day.  It’s trainer Aiden O’Brien’s fourth triumph in the 1.4
million-pound ($2.1 million) race.  Dawn Approach, the 5-4 favorite in the 12-horse field, was
never a factor and finished 11th. It was the colt’s first loss
in eight career races.  Galileo Rock, with 25-1 odds, was third ahead of Battle of
Marengo, the 11-2 second favorite ridden by Aiden O’Brien’s son
Joseph, who won last year’s race aboard Camelot.  Queen Elizabeth  was in attendance at the Derby, which was
first run in 1779 when Edward Smith Stanley, the 12th Earl of
Derby, organized a competition for himself and his friends. It
was extended to its current length five years later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
