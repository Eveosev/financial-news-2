Larry Drew has reached an agreement
to coach the National Basketball Association’s Milwaukee Bucks,
according to General Manager John Hammond.  The team declined to give details of the deal with Drew,
the former coach of the  Atlanta Hawks . He will receive a four-year $10 million contract, ESPN reported, citing people familiar
with the negotiations.  “After a thorough search and interview process, it is
clear to us that Larry’s track record in Atlanta, along with his
experience as an assistant coach and player, make him the right
choice to lead our club,” Hammond said in a statement.  Drew, 55, guided the Hawks to three consecutive postseason
appearances that included a first-round series victory over
Orlando in 2011. He accumulated a record of 128-102.  Before arriving in Atlanta as lead assistant coach with the
Hawks in 2004, Drew was an assistant with the  New Jersey Nets 
and the  Washington Wizards .  As a player, Drew averaged 11.4 points and 5.2 assists in
714 career games with the  Detroit Pistons , the Sacramento Kings
and the Los Angeles Clippers and Lakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
