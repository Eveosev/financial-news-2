Chris Andersen was suspended and
won’t be on the court tonight when the  Miami Heat  visit the
 Indiana Pacers  in Game 6 of the National Basketball
Association’s Eastern Conference finals.  The 34-year-old forward was suspended for one game without
pay after an altercation with Pacers forward Tyler Hansbrough
two nights ago in Miami’s 90-79 win over the Pacers, said Stu Jackson, NBA executive vice president of basketball operations.  Andersen, who has averaged 7.1 points and four rebounds per
game during the playoffs, knocked Hansbrough to the floor with
nine minutes, two seconds left in the second quarter. He
escalated the altercation by shoving Hansbrough and then
resisted efforts to bring the situation to an end, the league
said.  The defending champion Heat lead three games to two and can
eliminate the Pacers tonight with a victory in the best-of-seven
series. The winner of the conference final plays the  San Antonio
Spurs  for the championship title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
