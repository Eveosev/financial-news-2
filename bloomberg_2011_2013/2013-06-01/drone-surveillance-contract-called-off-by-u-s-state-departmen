The U.S. State Department  canceled 
its $1 billion surveillance drone competition, saying none of
the proposals met its requirements, according to the U.S.
government’s Federal Business Opportunities website.  The competition had called for companies to operate small-scale unmanned aircraft that would supply real-time video of
convoy routes and buildings. It was an opportunity for companies
such as  Aerovironment Inc. (AVAV)  and Vanguard Defense Industries LLC
to boost sales outside the Department of Defense, the biggest
U.S. buyer of unmanned aircraft.  The State Department “plans to examine closely the
requirements stipulated in the solicitation with the intent of
developing and releasing a new” request for drone proposals,
according to the notice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
