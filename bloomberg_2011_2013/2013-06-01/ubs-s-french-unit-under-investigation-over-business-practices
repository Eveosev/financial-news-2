UBS AG (UBSN) ’s French unit has been placed
under formal investigation as part of an inquiry initiated last
year over the bank’s practices in  France , a spokesman said.  The unit will fully cooperate with French authorities,
Christoph Meier, a spokesman for the Zurich-based bank, said in
an e-mailed statement, adding that the French operation
“conducts its business in full compliance with French laws and
regulations.”  The investigation includes allegations that the bank,
Switzerland’s biggest, was complicit in creating a system aimed
at soliciting wealthy French citizens to open undeclared
accounts in Switzerland, Agence France-Presse reported, citing
an unnamed French judicial source.  UBS’s Meier declined to comment on the content of the
investigation.  Switzerland enacted bank secrecy laws in 1934 after a
French tax evasion investigation. In that case, Basler
Handelsbank bankers were arrested in Paris in 1932 for aiding
the firm’s French clients in tax evasion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
