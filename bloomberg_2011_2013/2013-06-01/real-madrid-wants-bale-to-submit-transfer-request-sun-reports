Real  Madrid  wants Gareth Bale to
submit a written transfer request to force through a 80-million
pounds ($122 million) move from Tottenham, the Sun said.  Real is one of five clubs prepared to pay the record-tying
transfer figure for the Welsh winger, the Sun said. Manchester
United,  Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona are
the others, according to the Sun.  Bale, 23, has three years left on his current deal and
Tottenham wants him to sign a new 170,000 pounds-per-week
contract. Real is ready to offer Bale 10 million pounds a year
and wants the transfer request so it can make formal contact
with his agent, the Sun said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
