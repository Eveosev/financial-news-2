The  Chicago  Blackhawks defeated the
Los Angeles Kings 2-1, while the Boston Bruins shut out the
Pittsburgh Penguins 3-0 in the opening games of the National
Hockey League conference finals.  The winners of the best-of-seven conference series will vie
for the Stanley Cup.  Patrick Sharp and Marian Hossa scored goals in the second
period to give the Blackhawks the win after Justin Williams got
a goal in the first period for the Kings at the United Center in
Chicago.  “Every series gets more physical and intense as it goes
along,” Sharp said during a press conference. “Both teams
played a strong game for Game 1.  Weren’t a whole lot of scoring
chances from both sides.  Probably going to see a lot more of
that going forward.”  Chicago hosts Game 2 in the Western Conference series
today.  In the Eastern Conference, David Krejci scored two goals
and Nathan Horton added a third for the Bruins at Consol Energy
Center in Pittsburgh.  “I think it was a good win,” Krejci told reporters. “I
think it took lots of energy. It wasn’t easy. I don’t know why,
maybe because we had a week off. For some reason, I found it
very tough, but we got a win. We got a day off so we got to
regroup and get ready for Monday.”  The NHL top-scoring Penguins host Game 2 tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
