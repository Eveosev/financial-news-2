Cerberus Capital Management LP said
it raised its holding in Seibu Holdings Inc. to 35.5 percent
through a tender offer as the private-equity company seeks to
boost its control of the Japanese rail and hotel operator.  Cerberus increased its stake as of yesterday from 32.4
percent, the company said in a statement. The company has also
recommended that executives, including former U.S. Vice
President Dan Quayle, be appointed to Seibu’s board.  The New York-based private equity firm, which oversees more
than $20 billion, is battling with Seibu to delay an initial
public offering for up to three years as it seeks changes at the
company to improve profitability. Seibu President Takashi Goto
has said he won’t offer “any concessions” to Cerberus.  Seibu said today it opposes Cerberus’s plan to name members
to the board and will urge shareholders to vote against it at a
scheduled June 25 meeting.  Cerberus led a bailout of the company with Nikko Principal
Investments Japan Ltd. in 2005 after the rail operator was
delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange the year before for
breaking exchange rules by misstating stakes. Seibu said earlier
this year that it is now “financially prepared” for the
relisting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
