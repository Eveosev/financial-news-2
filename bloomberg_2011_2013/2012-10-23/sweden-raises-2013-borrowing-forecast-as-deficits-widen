Sweden raised its estimate for next
year’s borrowing as the government stimulates the export-
dependent Nordic  economy  amid rising unemployment.  The National Debt Office increased its estimate for sales
of nominal bonds this year to 74 billion kronor ($11.2 billion)
from 63 billion kronor predicted in June, according to a
statement published today in Stockholm. The agency said it
expects to issue 84 billion kronor in nominal bonds in 2014.  The government last month said it will spend 23 billion
kronor on infrastructure, research and corporate tax cuts next
year to stimulate the $500 billion economy. Sweden gets half of
its output from export, of which more than 70 percent go to
 Europe  where countries are cutting spending to reduce debt.  “Our assessment is that the Swedish economy is on solid
ground and is holding up relatively well despite the crisis in
the euro-zone,” the agency said. “Sweden has strong central
government finances, a well-established fiscal framework, its
own currency, a competitive export sector and current account
surpluses.”  Sweden will post a deficit of 28 billion kronor this year,
55 billion kronor next year and 56 billion kronor in 2014, the
agency said. Sweden’s economy will grow 1 percent this year and
1.6 in 2013, the debt office predicted today.  The amount targeted at each bond auction was increased to 4
billion kronor from 3.5 billion kronor, the agency said.  Sweden will also raise inflation-linked issuance to 9
billion kronor next year from a previous estimate of 6 billion
kronor and boost foreign currency borrowing to 50 billion kronor
from an estimate of 32 billion kronor. The agency said it plans
to borrow the equivalent of 7 billion kronor in 2013 and 27
billion kronor in 2014 in foreign currency bonds, besides its
on-lending to the Riksbank.  “Demand is strong for both government and inflation-linked
bonds and we hope a larger supply may contribute to improving
liquidity further in the domestic bond market,” the agency
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
