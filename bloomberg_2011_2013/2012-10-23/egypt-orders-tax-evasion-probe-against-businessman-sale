Egypt â€™s prosecutor-general, Abdel-
Meguid Mahmoud, has ordered an investigation of businessman
Hussein Salem on charges of evading 90 million pounds of taxes
over the course of 15 years, the general prosecution service
said in a faxed statement today.  Salem, a close associate of ousted president  Hosni Mubarak ,
was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia on June 28 on the
charge of selling gas to Israel at below-market prices, costing
Egypt $715 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
