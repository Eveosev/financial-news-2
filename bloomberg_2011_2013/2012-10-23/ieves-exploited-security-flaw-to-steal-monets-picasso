The thieves who stole seven
paintings including works by  Pablo Picasso  and  Claude Monet  from
the Rotterdam  Kunsthal  on Oct. 16 probably exploited a flaw in
the locking security system, the museum said in a statement.  The museum said it has an electronic locking system that
responds to the alarm. After some time, the electronic system
deactivates automatically, although the doors remain
mechanically locked, according to a Kunsthal e-mailed statement
sent today.  “The investigation into the theft that took place on
Monday evening has revealed that the burglars probably forced
the locks” after the electronic locking system automatically
deactivated, the Kunsthal said. Camera images show the burglary
took just two minutes, the museum said.  Seven paintings, including works by Picasso, Monet,  Henri Matisse ,  Paul Gauguin  and  Lucian Freud  were stolen from the
Kunsthal in the Dutch port city. The combined value may be as
much as $130 million, making the burglary one of the most
spectacular art heists of the last few decades.  The paintings stolen were Picasso’s “Tete d’Arlequin;”
Monet’s “Waterloo Bridge, London” and “Charing Cross Bridge,
London;” Freud’s “Woman with Eyes Closed;” Matisse’s “La
Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune;” Gauguin’s “Femme Devant une
Fenetre Ouverte, dite la Fiancee,” and Meyer de Haan’s
“Autoportrait.”  Fire System  The museum has since made adjustments to its locking
system, according to the statement. Its alarm, camera and
entrance control systems were all inspected in the past months
and a new fire alarm and smoke detectors were installed earlier
this year, it said.  The theft took place at about 3.15 a.m. on Oct. 16, the
Rotterdam-Rijnmond police said. Investigators have released
camera pictures on which the faces of the thieves are
unidentifiable. They are hoping that people may recognize the
combination of two or more figures and their distinctive bags, a
statement on the police website said. Investigators have
received 60 leads so far, it said.  Muse highlights include  Richard Vines  on Scottish dining
and  Craig Seligman  on books.  To contact the reporter on this story:
