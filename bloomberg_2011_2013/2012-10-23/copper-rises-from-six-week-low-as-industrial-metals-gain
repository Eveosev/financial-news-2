Copper recovered from a six-week low
on speculation that  China , the largest user, will introduce more
measures to support growth, boosting demand for metals.  Copper for delivery in three months gained as much as 0.7
percent to $8,009 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,953 at 2:04 p.m. Shanghai time. Futures
fell to $7,930 yesterday, the lowest level since Sept. 7.  China added 13 railway projects to this year’s investment
plan, increasing the number to 22, the Economic Information
Daily  reported  today, without citing anyone. The country
approved last month plans to build about 1,250 miles (2,000
kilometers) of roads, 25 new subway and inter-city rail projects
as well as port and warehouse developments. Premier  Wen Jiabao 
said the “economic growth has started to stabilize,” the
Xinhua News Agency reported on Oct. 17.  “We expect the Chinese economy to gradually improve into
the first quarter,” Zhang Sida, an analyst at Dalu Futures Co.,
said by phone from Shanghai. “The demand is not good, but it
should improve as a stabilizing equities market indicates.”  China’s benchmark stock index rose to a six-week high
yesterday on speculation regulators will introduce measures to
bolster equities before a once-a-decade leadership transition
next month. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  traded 0.7 percent
lower today.  January futures fell 0.5 percent to 57,580  yuan  ($9,215) a
ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. December futures on the
Comex in  New York  were little changed at $3.6175 a pound.  On the LME, tin, zinc and nickel advanced.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
