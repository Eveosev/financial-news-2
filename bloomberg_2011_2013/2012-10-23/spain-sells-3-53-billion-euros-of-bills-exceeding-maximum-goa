Spain sold 3.53 billion euros ($4.6
billion) of bills compared with a maximum target of 3.5 billion
euros, the Bank of Spain said.  The Treasury sold its 6-month bills at an average yield of
2.023 percent, compared with 2.213 percent when it last
auctioned the debt on Sept. 25. The yield on 3-month notes was
1.415 percent compared with 1.203 percent in a previous auction.  Demand for the 6-month securities was 1.99 times the amount
sold, compared with 1.83 times at the previous auction and
demand for the 3-month paper was 4.32 times compared with 3.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
