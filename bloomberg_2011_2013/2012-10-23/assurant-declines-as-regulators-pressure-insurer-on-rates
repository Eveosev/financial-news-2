Assurant Inc. (AIZ)  slid the most since
January after saying earnings would be reduced by the decision
to cut rates in California under pressure from a regulator.  Assurant will lower prices 30.5 percent at the American
Security unit, which sells home coverage that borrowers must buy
when they miss payments on their initial policies, California
Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said yesterday. The firm
declined 5.5 percent to $38.64 at 4:01 p.m. in New York.  Regulators in California,  Florida  and New York have been
pressing providers of so-called force-placed policies to cut
premiums amid inquiries into whether they charge too much. The
coverage is typically selected by lenders and paid for by
borrowers. The New York-based insurer, which dominates the
market for the coverage along with QBE Insurance Group Ltd.,
said yesterday the  California  changes will cut annualized net
income by about $18 million.  “We think a real risk to 2013-2014 earnings will come if
other states demand premium rate cuts,” Sean Dargan, an analyst
at Macquarie Group Ltd., wrote in a note dated yesterday. “New
York may be next.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
