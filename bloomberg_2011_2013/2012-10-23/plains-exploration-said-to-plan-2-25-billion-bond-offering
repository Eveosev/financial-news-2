Plains Exploration & Production Co. (PXP) ,
the oil and gas producer acquiring assets from BP Plc and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc, sold $3 billion of bonds in two parts to help
fund the purchase.  The company sold $1.5 billion each of 6.5 percent, eight-
year debt to yield 509 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and 6.875 percent securities due February 2023 at a
relative yield of 516 basis points, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Proceeds also will go toward repaying a senior
revolving credit facility, the Houston-based company said in a
filing. The offering was for an original $2.25 billion.  Plains last sold benchmark debt in April, issuing $750
million of 6.125 percent securities due June 2019 that traded at
101.5 cents on the dollar to yield 5.85 percent on Oct. 16,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  In September, Plains Exploration agreed to acquire from BP
all of its interests in certain deep-water Gulf of Mexico oil
and gas properties for $5.5 billion. Shell sold its stake in a
field co-owned with BP for $560 million, according to a Sept. 10
company statement.  Moodyâ€™s Investors Service assigned a B1 rating to the issue
and placed it under review for downgrade to B2, and possibly
further cuts, the ratings company said today in a release.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc, Bank of Montreal,
Citigroup Inc., and  Wells Fargo & Co . managed the sale,
