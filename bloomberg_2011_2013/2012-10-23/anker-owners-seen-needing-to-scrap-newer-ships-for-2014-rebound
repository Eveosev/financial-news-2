Owners of  oil tankers  must scrap
younger vessels for the market to recover by 2014 or 2015,
according to shipbroker Braemar Seascope Ltd.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a measure of crude-shipping
costs, may reach 1,200 by 2014 or 2015 if owners demolish 15-
year-old vessels,  Mark Williams , research director at Braemar,
said today at the  Seatrade Tanker Industry Conference  in
Copenhagen. The gauge last touched that level in January 2010,
according to the  Baltic Exchange , which assesses freight rates.  “It seems dramatic, but it’s already happening,” Williams
said of the demolitions. The index rose 0.6 percent to 680
yesterday, figures from the London-based exchange showed.  With world oil consumption growing 1 or 2 percent a year,
the tanker industry needs to accelerate scrapping to end its
slump after owners ordered too many vessels before the global
recession, according to Williams. Earnings for tankers hauling
refined products won’t recover next year either, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
