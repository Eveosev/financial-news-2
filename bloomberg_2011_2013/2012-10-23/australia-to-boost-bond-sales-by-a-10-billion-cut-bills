Australia  will increase the amount
of bonds it sells by $A10 billion ($10.3 billion) and cut bill
issuance to lengthen the average duration of its debt portfolio,
the government’s funding arm said today.  The government plans to issue A$45 billion of bonds in the
2012-13 fiscal year, the Australian Office of Financial
Management said in an e-mailed statement today. That compares
with A$35 billion predicted at the time of the May budget. The
reduction in bill issuance will fully offset the extra volume of
bond sales, it said. The AOFM has issued about A$17.3 billion in
bonds so far this financial year, according to the statement.  Treasurer Wayne Swan yesterday reiterated that the
Australian government would seek to return the budget to surplus
in 2012-13 following four years of deficits which have pushed up
the amount of Australian debt outstanding to about $260 billion.
At the same time, Australian bond yields plunged to record lows
as the central bank cut borrowing costs and investors sought the
relative safety of government debt amid global financial
turmoil.  The government “sees that yields are very low and this is
an opportune time to be lengthening the duration of a liability
portfolio,” said Adam Donaldson, Sydney-based head of debt
research at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA)  “At the same time,
there’s recognition that there’s going to be a significant stock
of debt there for some time, so they can go ahead and do that.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  was at 3.19 percent as of 11:57
a.m. in Sydney. It touched a record low of 2.70 percent on June
4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
