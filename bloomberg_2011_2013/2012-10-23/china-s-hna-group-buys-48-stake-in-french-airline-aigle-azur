HNA Group Co., parent of China’s
 Hainan Airlines Co. (600221) , has acquired a 48 percent stake in France’s
Aigle Azur Transports Aeriens SAS, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  The purchase makes HNA Group Aigle Azur’s second-biggest
shareholder and gives the Chinese company the right to appoint
two of the five-member executive committee that governs the
French airline, according to the statement, which didn’t give a
price paid for the stake. HNA Group also gains the right to
appoint a vice president and a deputy chief financial officer.  HNA Group, which had $15.4 billion of revenue last year,
has sought to expand beyond the Chinese market with investments
in Turkey and  Hong Kong . Paris-based  Aigle Azur  operates 300
scheduled flights a week with route networks covering Algeria,
Mali, Portugal, Russia and Tunisia, according to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
