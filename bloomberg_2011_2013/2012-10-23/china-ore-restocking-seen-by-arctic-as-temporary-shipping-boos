Following are comments by Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo,
about Chinese demand for imported iron ore.  He commented in a report today and a follow-up e-mailed
response to questions. Rates for Capesize vessels that deliver
the raw material used to make steel almost doubled this month to
$15,599 a day, according to data from the London-based Baltic
Exchange.  “Chinese mills are restocking from port stocks at a faster
pace than imports are coming in, so port stocks are declining.  “But the underlying market for steel use does not seem to
have changed fundamentally. As such, we see the current upturn
in freight rates as somewhat temporary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
