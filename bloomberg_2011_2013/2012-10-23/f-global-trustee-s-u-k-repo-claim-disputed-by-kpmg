MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) ’s U.K.
administrators asked a judge to settle a dispute with its  New
York  brokerage arm over internal trades that allowed the company
to buy distressed sovereign bonds before it collapsed.  James Giddens, the U.S. bankruptcy trustee for MF Global
Inc., claims the U.K. subsidiary owes about 287 million pounds
($458 million) to settle internal repurchase agreements on
Irish, Portuguese and Spanish sovereign debt, according to court
documents provided by its lawyers. KPMG LLP, which is winding up
the U.K. unit, says it only owes about $60 million.  Judge David Richards in  London  will decide which side gets
to value the claim following a two-day court hearing.  MF Global Holdings filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy
on Oct. 31 after getting margin calls and bank demands for money
at its brokerage following its investment in the debt of
troubled European economies.  Disputes between MF Global’s U.K. administrators and the
various trustees of the U.S. entities must be resolved by judges
before about $1 billion can be returned to clients or creditors.  KPMG spokeswoman Sorrelle Cooper declined to comment. Will
Browne, a spokesman for Giddens, declined to immediately comment
by e-mail.  Repurchase agreements  are contracts under which a party
agrees to sell securities and buy them back at a later date.
Repos can be used as a type of loan, or to move risky assets off
a balance sheet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
