The developers of 701 Seventh Ave.
in Manhattan’s Times Square expect to have an agreement with a
hotel company in the next 45 days that may pave the way for a
new tower, one of the site’s owners said.  The owners want a “W-type” name for the site, said Steven Witkoff, referring to  Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) ’s
boutique brand. He spoke today at a midtown Manhattan conference
sponsored by the law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP.  Witkoff and partners  Vector Group Ltd. (VGR)  and  Winthrop Realty
Trust (FUR)  announced last week they had bought the property, located
on the northeast corner of Seventh Avenue and West 47th Street
in one of New York’s most popular tourist areas. They intend to
build a 475-room, 220,000-square-foot (20,400-square-meter)
hotel on the site, above an 8-story, 82,000-square-foot retail
base, Witkoff said.  “If we produce a hotel brand on top and get anywhere close
to the leasing on this down below, the deal’s a screamer,”
Witkoff said. “We’ll look a lot smarter than we probably are.”  Times Square hotels have averaged 86.4 percent occupancy
this year through September, according to data from Smith Travel
Research Inc. in Hendersonville,  Tennessee . That’s up from 83.1
percent a year earlier.  Witkoff didn’t identify the name of the hotel operator the
group is in negotiations with. The investor group paid $375
million for 701 Seventh Ave., plus closing costs and other
expenses that brought the total to about $430 million, he said.
Barry Sternlicht’s  Starwood Property Trust Inc. (STWD)  and Starwood
Capital Group LLC provided $475 million of debt to the partners.  The site also has rights to a 22,000-square-foot light-
emitting diode sign that would be among the biggest in Times
Square, Witkoff said.  The property currently houses two office buildings, one of
which was built in 1909. The larger building is covered almost
entirely in advertising signs, mostly promoting Broadway shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
