Vietnam’s five-year government bonds
advanced for the first time in three weeks after data showed
inflation in Ho Chi Minh City slowed this month. The dong was
little changed.  Consumer prices  in Vietnam’s largest city rose 0.18 percent
in October from the month before, online newspaper CafeF
reported yesterday, citing the city’s statistics department.
That compares with a 1.21 percent increase from August to
September. Inflation for the entire country may reach 8 percent
by the end of 2012, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung told
lawmakers yesterday. Consumer prices rose 6.48 percent in
September from a year earlier, official data show.  “Inflation in Ho Chi Minh City is lower than expected and
that’s why yields are lower today,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho
Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities. He
forecast annual inflation could reach 9 percent by the end of
the year.  The yield on benchmark five-year bonds fell eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 10.30 percent, according to
a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
first drop since Oct. 2 and the sharpest decline since July 20.  The dong traded at 20,855 per dollar as of 2:13 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,850 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The State Bank of  Vietnam  set its
reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
