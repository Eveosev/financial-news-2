Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., (UCSP)   Kenya ’s
best-performing stock this year, climbed for a fourth day to its
highest in a week after the company declared a dividend for the
first time since 2002.  Shares in Kenya’s only publicly traded retail chain gained
1.6 percent to 19.25 shillings by 1:40 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi. A close at that level will be the highest since Oct.
16.  “It’s going up because of the dividend,” Eric Munywoki, a
research analyst at Nairobi-based Old Mutual Securities Ltd.,
said by telephone. “As the new branches mature, we expect them
to contribute to both the top line and bottom line.”  Uchumi on Oct. 17 said full-year profit fell 30 percent to
274 million shillings ($3.2 million) in the 12 months through
June, as operating expenses jumped 48 percent after it opened
new stores in Kenya and neighboring Uganda and Tanzania. Revenue
increased 29 percent to 13.9 billion shillings. It declared a
 dividend  of 0.3 shillings a share.  During the fiscal year to June 30, Uchumi opened three
outlets in Uganda and one each in Tanzania and Kenya for a total
of 24 stores, according to a statement on the company’s website.
Uchumi’s stock has more than doubled this year, compared with a
32 percent gain on the  NSE All-Share Index. (NSEASI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
