Russian lawmakers approved
amendments to the penal code that toughen the rules protecting
state secrets.  The new regulations introduce penalties for illegal receipt
of secret information and disclosure to “international
organizations,” according to a summary of today’s parliamentary
session posted on its website. It didn’t define what’s meant by
such organizations.  The maximum penalties were set at 500,000 rubles ($15,911)
or eight years in prison, according to the summary, which
described illicit methods of acquiring secrets as theft, fraud,
blackmail and through threats to use violence.  President  Vladimir Putin  has accused opposition activists
of being financed by foreign nations seeking to interfere in his
country’s politics. A bill classifying non-governmental
organizations that get financial aid from abroad as “foreign
agents” was backed by lawmakers in July, while Russia ordered
the U.S. aid agency USAID to halt activities in September.  The new penalties for disclosing secrets are designed to
halt foreign intelligence services that use international
organizations as camouflage, Interfax cited the deputy head of
the Federal Security Service, Yury Gorbunov, as saying Sept. 21.  “These rules could fit in a country with an iron
curtain,” Mikhail Fedotov, head of the Kremlin’s human-rights
commission, said by phone. “But we don’t have this curtain
anymore. We’re integrated into the global economy, talking to
people from everywhere.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
