Green Bay Packers Pro Bowl safety
Charles Woodson has a broken collarbone and will probably miss
at least the next five games, including a Nov. 25 matchup
against the  New York  Giants.  Woodson, 36, was hurt two days ago in the Packers’ 30-20
victory against the St. Louis Rams. X-rays revealed the extent
of the injury yesterday and coach Mike McCarthy said Woodson
would be out for approximately six weeks.  An eight-time Pro Bowl selection and the National Football
League’s Defensive Player of the Year in 2009, Woodson’s 55
career interceptions rank second to Ed Reed of the Baltimore
Ravens among active players. He’ll probably miss games against
the Jacksonville Jaguars,  Arizona  Cardinals, Detroit Lions and
Minnesota Vikings in addition to the Giants.  “Charles’s injury is significant, but our younger players
are prepared and we’ll move forward,” McCarthy said yesterday
at a news conference.  Woodson also broke his collarbone in the Packers’ Super
Bowl win against Pittsburgh following the 2010 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
