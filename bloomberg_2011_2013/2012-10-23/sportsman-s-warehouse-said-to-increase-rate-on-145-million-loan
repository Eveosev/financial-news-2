Sportsman’s Warehouse Inc., an
outdoor sporting-goods retailer, increased the  interest rate  it
will pay on a $145 million  term loan  it’s seeking to fund a
dividend to shareholders, according to a person with knowledge
of the transaction.  The six-year debt will now pay interest at 6 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, up from 5.25
percentage points, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. The minimum on
the benchmark will remain unchanged at 1.5 percent.  Sportsman’s Warehouse is proposing to sell the loan at 99
cents on the dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the
company and boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders are being offered call protection of 102 cents
during the first year, the person said. The premium to refinance
the debt will drop to 1 cent more than face value in the second
year.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing and
commitments are due by 5 p.m. tomorrow in  New York , the person
said. The debt is rated B3 by Moody’s Investors Service and B by
 Standard & Poor’s .  Seidler Equity Partners LP acquired the Midvale, Utah-based
company for an undisclosed amount in August 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Karen Seaman, chief marketing officer of Sportsman’s
Warehouse, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
