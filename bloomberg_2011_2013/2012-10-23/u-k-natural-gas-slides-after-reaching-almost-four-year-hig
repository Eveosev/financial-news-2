U.K. natural gas for next month
trimmed its biggest monthly advance in more than two years as
technical indicators showed that the contract rose too fast.  Within-day gas was little changed near its highest level
since February, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
The relative strength index on the month-ahead contract was 83
yesterday. A reading above 70 may indicate that a security is
overbought.  Gas for the coming  month  dropped 1.1 percent to 68.45 pence
a therm at 8:38 a.m.  London  time. Thatâ€™s equivalent to $10.95
per million British thermal units and compares with $3.46 per
million Btu for front-month U.S. gas.  Next-month gas  has risen 16 percent since Sept. 24, the
biggest monthly gain since the period to Sept. 24, 2009. The
contract reached 69.5 pence a therm yesterday, the most since
November 2008.  Weather Services International Ltd. said yesterday that
November in the U.K. will be cooler than usual while December
and January will be warmer than average.  The low temperature in London will drop to zero degrees
Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) on Oct. 28, compared with a 10-year
average of 6 degrees, CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg show.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 221
million cubic meters, down from 235 million yesterday,  National
Grid Plc (NG/)  data show. The delivery network will contain 332
million cubic meters of gas at the end of the period, down from
338 million in the previous period.  Power for  tomorrow  rose 1.7 percent to 51 pounds a
megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
