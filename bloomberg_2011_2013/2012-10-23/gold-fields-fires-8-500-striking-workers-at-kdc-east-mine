Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the world’s
fourth-biggest gold producer, said it fired 8,500 striking
workers at its KDC East mine in South Africa after they failed
to heed an ultimatum to return to work.  The fired workers can appeal, Willie Jacobsz, a company
spokesman, said in a phone interview today.  Illegal mining strikes began in South Africa at Lonmin
Plc’s Marikana platinum mine on Aug. 10 and have spread to gold,
 iron ore  and chrome mines as workers bypassed labor unions to
demand higher pay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
