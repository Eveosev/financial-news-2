Regions Financial Corp. (RF)  fell the
most in almost a year in  New York  trading after the bank said it
would move as much as $400 million in loans to non-performing
status in the fourth quarter.  Regions declined 7.6 percent to $6.54 at 4:15 p.m., the
biggest drop since Oct. 31, 2011, after the Birmingham, Alabama-
based company identified about $300 million to $400 million of
“potential problem” commercial and investor real estate loans.  “That raised a cautionary flag,” said  Gerard Cassidy , an
analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  who rates the shares outperform.
“This is the first company this quarter that had to address a
number of credit quality questions, whereas most of the stocks
that have been hit have been hit because of the margin and not
credit-related questions.”  The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall, 55,
said additions to non-performing loans climbed to $463 million
in the third quarter, the first increase in a year. The net
interest margin, a gauge of lending profitability, widened to
3.08 percent from 3.04 percent in the same period last year and
narrowed from 3.16 percent in the second quarter.  Regions has cut its bad-loan provision for eight straight
quarters and the shares surged 65 percent this year through
yesterday, the  second-best performer  in the 24-company  KBW Bank
Index. (BKX)  The lender set aside $33 million for bad loans during the
third quarter, compared with $355 million in the same period
last year.  Matching Estimates  Third-quarter profit almost doubled to $301 million, or 21
cents a share, from $155 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier,
the bank said today in a statement. That matched the  average
estimate  of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Regions is considering a preferred stock offering in “the
near future” if market conditions are favorable, according to a
separate statement today. The proceeds would be used for general
corporate purposes, which may include the redemption of certain
trust-preferred securities, Regions said.  Total revenue declined 1 percent to $1.35 billion in the
third quarter as net interest income fell to $817 million from
$850 million. Non-interest income rose 3.9 percent to $533
million as mortgage income climbed to a record $106 million from
$68 million last year.  Historically low  interest rates  and government incentive
programs are fueling demand for home loans.  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) , the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported a third-quarter
profit increase this month that included a 72 percent surge in
mortgage revenue. CEO  Jamie Dimon  said at the time that the
housing market has “turned the corner.”  Bank of America Chief Financial Officer  Bruce Thompson  said
this month that housing prices are “no question” moving in the
right direction.  Net charge-offs at Regions declined 49 percent to $262
million. Total loans fell 5.3 percent to $75.3 billion. That was
driven by a 12 percent drop in consumer credit-card loans to
$901 million and a 27 percent decrease in investor real estate
loans to $8.71 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
