Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , the biggest
water company, gave up control of its Transdev transportation
unit to French state-owned bank Caisse des Depots &
Consignations as part of an asset disposal plan.  CDC, which already owns 50 percent of Veolia Transdev, will
increase its shareholding to 60 percent following an 800
million-euro ($1.04 billion) capital increase by conversion of
shareholder loans, according to a statement today.  “For Veolia Environment, this project would represent a
first step in its progressive withdrawal from transportation
activities,” the Paris-based company said in the statement.  Veolia will retain a 40 percent stake in Transdev and will
acquire the 66 percent stake the transportation unit has in the
Societe Nationale Corse Mediterranee ferry company and its
subsidiaries. A final agreement has yet to be reached between
the two sides.  The deal will allow Veolia to remove 900 million euros of
debt from its balance sheet and won’t bring in any cash for the
company,  Les Echos  reported earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
