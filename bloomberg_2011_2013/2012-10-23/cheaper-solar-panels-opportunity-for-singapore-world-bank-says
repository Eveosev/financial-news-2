Falling prices for solar panels
present an opportunity for  Singapore  to invest more in renewable
energy, according to a World Bank official.  The city-state may focus more on solar spending given the
drop in panel costs, Dejan R. Ostojic, the energy sector leader
for East Asia and Pacific Region, said in an interview in the
city-state today.  “Prices for solar panels have declined significantly in
the past year or two,” said Ostojic. “Investors would probably
like to take advantage of the favorable pricing.”  Electricity generation systems of all types will expand as
energy demand increases amid economic growth in Singapore, he
said. “Renewables will certainly play a role,” he added.  Solar panel prices have declined 15 percent this year,
falling to 83.87 cents a watt, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance data.  Ostojic is also optimistic about  China ’s expansion into
wind power generation.  China, the world’s largest wind-power market, aims to
increase its installed capacity from the source to 100 gigawatts
by 2015, the State Council said in July.  “China has done remarkably well in increasing wind
capacity,” he said. “It has its own target and there is no
reason to doubt it.”  The country faces challenges in adding to its wind-power
capacity because the expansion of the transmission grid has not
kept pace with the additional generation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
