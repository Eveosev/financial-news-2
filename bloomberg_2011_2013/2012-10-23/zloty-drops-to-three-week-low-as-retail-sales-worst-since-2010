The zloty slid to the weakest in
more than three weeks after a report showed Polish  retail sales 
growth slumped the most since April 2010, piling pressure on the
central to lower borrowing costs to revive economic growth.  The zloty weakened 0.6 percent to 4.1288 per euro as of
5:05 p.m. in Warsaw, the second-steepest decline among more than
20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after South
Africa’s rand and its lowest intraday level since Sept. 28. The
yield on two-year notes rose two basis points to 3.89 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Polish retail-sales growth slowed more than economists
estimated in September, boosting pressure on policy makers to
aid the economy by lowering interest rates from a three-year
high. Sales advanced 3.1 percent from a year earlier, the
statistics office said today. That was less than the 4.5 percent
median forecast of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The data obviously support expectations for interest-rate
cuts,” Ernest Pytlarczyk and Marcin Mazurek, economists at BRE
Bank SA, wrote in e-mailed comments today. “Policy makers will
have to revise their quite optimistic perception of  Poland ’s
economic situation.”  The central bank increased interest rates by a quarter
point to 4.75 percent in May, making Poland the only country in
the European Union to raise borrowing costs this year. Policy
makers said last month they will cut rates should new data
confirm a “protracted” economic slowdown and “limited” risk
of price pressure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
