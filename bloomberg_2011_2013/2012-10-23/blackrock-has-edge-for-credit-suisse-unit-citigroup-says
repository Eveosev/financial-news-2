BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
exchange-traded fund provider, has an “edge” over State Street
Corp. in buying  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s ETF business, according
to Citigroup Inc. analysts.  An acquisition would allow BlackRock to bolster the
presence of its iShares ETF unit in Europe, Citigroup analysts
led by  William Katz  wrote in a note today to clients. BlackRock
has a history of integrating smaller asset managers and it has
stronger financial flexibility, while State Street is more
focused on returning capital to shareholders and could be
restricted as a result of activist investors, according to the
note.  Credit Suisse has put its European ETF business, which has
about $17 billion in assets under management, up for sale and
potential acquirers include New York-based BlackRock and Boston-
based State Street, according to a Reuters report on Oct. 19.
Credit Suisse has 58 ETFs listed in Switzerland that invest in
mostly equities, with more than a 5 percent market share in
Europe, according to the Citigroup note.  Melissa Garville, a spokeswoman for BlackRock, declined to
comment. BlackRock has more than $700 billion in ETF assets
globally. The firm announced plans Oct. 15 to cut fees for six
ETFs and create four new ones as it seeks to fend off
competition from companies such as Vanguard Group Inc. and
Charles Schwab Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
