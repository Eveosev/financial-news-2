The European Union plans to propose
next year or in 2014 a framework for reducing  greenhouse gases 
in the period until 2030 to ensure regulatory stability
necessary for investments in clean technologies.  The proposal will “provide a long-term perspective on how
the EU will move ahead from its 2020 targets to continue the
trajectory toward a low-carbon economy,” the European
Commission said in a policy paper on its work program published
today in Strasbourg,  France .  The 27-nation EU, which wants to lead the global fight
against  climate change , has a binding goal of cutting emissions
by 20 percent in 2020 compared with 1990 levels and a political
target to reduce greenhouse gases by 80 percent to 95 percent in
2050. The planned proposal will show how to meet the long-term
climate objective, according to the document.  The commission said last year that the most cost-efficient
way to reach the 2050 target would be to lower pollution by 40
percent in 2030 and 60 percent in 2040. While most EU countries
have voiced support for the so-called low-carbon road map by the
commission,  Poland  vetoed a ministerial declaration backing the
future emissions-reduction trajectory twice.  The planned 2030 framework for climate could also impact
emission caps in the EU emissions trading system, a cornerstone
of the bloc’s climate policy. The program, known as the EU ETS,
imposes pollution caps on about 12,000 utilities and
manufacturing companies in the region, leading to a cap on
discharges in 2020 that will be 21 percent below 2005 levels.  Under existing EU law pollution limits in the cap-and-trade
program will fall by 1.74 percent annually as of 2013. That will
lead to a “just over 70 percent reduction” in the ETS cap by
2050, which is not consistent with the long-term objective,
according to a draft report on the state of the EU carbon market
obtained by  Bloomberg News  and due to be published by the
commission next month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
