Pandora Media Inc. (P)  rose the most in
more than a month as the prospect of competition from  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
receded after the iPod maker unveiled no music product at an
event today.  Pandora, based in Oakland, California, climbed 8.4 percent
to $9.86 at the close for the biggest gain since Aug. 30. The
Internet radio company was the second-biggest gainer in the
 Russell 1000 Index. (RIY)   “This is likely a relief rally for Pandora shares,” James Marsh, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said in an e-mail. “The
most likely timing would be at the next iPod event, probably 10
months from now. So Pandora shares likely have some reprieve
from Apple’s threat, at least in the short term.”  Apple, at the event in San Jose, California, highlighted
new products and services including a smaller version of the
market-leading iPad tablet. While introducing the new tablet,
 Phil Schiller , Apple’s senior vice president of global
marketing, said Pandora looks and works great on the device.  Apple is negotiating with record labels for the rights to
start an advertising-supported streaming radio service, people
with knowledge of the plans said in interviews last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
