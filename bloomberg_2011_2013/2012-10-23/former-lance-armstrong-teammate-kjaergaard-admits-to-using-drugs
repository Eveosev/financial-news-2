Norwegian former professional
cyclist Steffen Kjaergaard said he used drugs while riding
alongside  Lance Armstrong , who was stripped of his seven Tour de
France titles this week for doping.  “I haven’t been able to carry the lie anymore,”
Kjaergaard said today in a press conference broadcast on
 Norway ’s TV2 channel. “I’m hurting on behalf of myself,
Norwegian cycling, my closest family and friends.”  Kjaergaard said he used erythropoietin and cortisone while
he rode on the U.S. Postal Service team with Armstrong in the
early 2000s when the American won some of his seven straight
Tour de France titles, according to TV2. He said he couldn’t
confirm who else on the team took drugs, although he “assumed
many were offered” illegal performance-enhancing products.  International cycling’s ruling body stripped Armstrong of
his seven titles and banned him from the sport for life
yesterday, endorsing a decision by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
The USADA had published evidence from 11 of his former teammates
that the 41-year-old had “engaged in serial cheating.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
