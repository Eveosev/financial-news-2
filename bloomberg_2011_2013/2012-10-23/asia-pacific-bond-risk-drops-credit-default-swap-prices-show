The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment is set to decline
for the first time in three trading days, according to traders
of credit-default swaps and data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2 basis points to 116 basis points
as of 8:39 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge, which has ranged from 112.6 basis points
to 175.3 basis points this half, is set for its lowest close
since Oct. 18, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 2 basis points
to 136.5 as of 10:59 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The index is also on course for its lowest close
since Oct. 18, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index also dropped 2 basis points
to 207 basis points as of 9:03 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The index has ranged from 168.5 to 229.5 this half,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
