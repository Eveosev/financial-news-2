Sudanese rebels shelled government
positions in Kadugli, capital of oil-rich Southern Kordofan
state, in response to army attacks against them and civilians, a
spokesman for the insurgents said.  The rebels of the  Sudan  People’s Liberation Movement-North
attacked Kadugli today after the Sudanese army shelled civilian
areas in the state from Oct. 18 to Oct. 21 and rebel positions
outside the city, spokesman Arnu Lodi said by phone from the
Kenyan capital, Nairobi. A United Nations spokesman confirmed
reports of fighting around Kadugli.  “They are responding to the shelling from SAF and the
aerial bombardment,” Lodi said.  Clashes started more than a year ago in Southern Kordofan
and Blue Nile states between President Umar al-Bashir’s
government and rebels who fought during a two-decade civil war
alongside the forces of South Sudan, which gained independence
in July last year. More than 175,000 people have fled the
violence into South Sudan, according to the UN.  The rebel shelling killed two children and injured eight
other civilians, Sudan’s army spokesman, al-Sawarami Khaled,
said in a phone interview from Khartoum, the capital.  “We had reports that there was arial bombardment outside
Kadugli this morning,” Damian Rance, a spokesman for the UN
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said by
phone from Khartoum. “Later in the morning we had reports of
mortar fire on Kadugli.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
