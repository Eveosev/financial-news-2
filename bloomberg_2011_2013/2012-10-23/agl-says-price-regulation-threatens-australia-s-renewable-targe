AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK) , the Australian
electricity and gas retailer, said regulatory changes limiting
retail power prices in  South Australia  and Queensland states
“call into question” whether the country will achieve its
renewable energy target.  “If state governments continue to interfere in regulating
retail prices, it’s unlikely it will be met,” AGL Chief
Executive Officer Michael Fraser told reporters today in Sydney,
referring to the country’s goal of getting 20 percent of its
power from renewable sources by the end of the decade.  AGL will suspend further investment in power generation,
including renewable energy, in South Australia as a result of a
plan in the state that would reduce the price of electricity,
the Sydney-based company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
