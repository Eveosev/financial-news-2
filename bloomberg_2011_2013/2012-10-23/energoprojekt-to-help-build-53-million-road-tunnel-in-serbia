Energoprojekt Holding AD (ENHL) , a Serbian
engineering company, said its  Niskogradnja (EPNS)  unit will act as sub-
contractor for  Azvirt MMC , an Azeri constructor building a
highway in the Balkan country.  Niskogradnja agreed to build a two-lane, 884-meter long
tunnel for 41 million euros ($53.4 million) within 34 months,
the Belgrade-based holding company said today in an e-mailed
statement. The tunnel will be part of the 40-kilometer (25-mile)
Ljig-Preljina highway in central Serbia that Azvirt is building
with a 308 million euro loan from Azerbaijan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
