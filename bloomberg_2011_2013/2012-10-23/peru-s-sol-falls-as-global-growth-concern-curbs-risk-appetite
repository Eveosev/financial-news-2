Peru ’s sol declined the most in a
week on concern slowing global growth will curb demand for the
Latin American country’s exports.  The sol depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5820 per U.S. dollar
at today’s close, from 2.5790 yesterday.  U.S. companies reported financial results that missed
analyst estimates, adding to evidence the recovery in the
world’s largest economy is faltering. Demand for Peru’s bonds
prevented a bigger slide in the sol, said Dirk Willer, the head
of Latin American local markets strategy at Citigroup Inc. in
New York.  The sol “has the best fundamentals in the region,
therefore it outperforms, but if all hell breaks loose in the
region, it should weaken somewhat, which is what it’s doing,”
Willer said.  Peru’s central bank bought $80 million in the spot market
and said on its website it paid an average 2.5819 soles per
dollar.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 declined two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.25 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.11 centimo to 123.45
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
