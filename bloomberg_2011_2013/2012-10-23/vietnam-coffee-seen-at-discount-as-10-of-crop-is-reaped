Coffee beans from Vietnam, the
world’s largest producer of the robusta variety, are trading at
a discount as farmers have gathered about 10 percent of the
2012-13 crop, according to trading company NC Group Ltd.  Vietnamese beans for October and November shipments were
offered for sale at a discount of $20 a metric ton to the price
on the NYSE Liffe exchange in  London , according to the trader,
which has offices in  Ho Chi Minh City . That compares with a
premium of $10 a ton two weeks ago, data from the trader showed.  “The differential levels have softened as much as $30 a
ton,” Nguyen Chi Cuong, chief executive officer at the company,
said by e-mail today. “The new crop is the reason behind it.”  Differentials refer to a premium or discount to obtain
physical coffee in relation to the futures price. Robusta coffee
for January delivery slid 1 percent to $2,058 a ton by 10:36
a.m. in London trading.  Vietnam will produce 26 million bags of coffee in 2012-13,
down from 27 million bags a year earlier, estimates Volcafe, the
coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. The
peak of the country’s harvest will be in November or December,
according to Cuong. There is still a lack of “strong interest
from buyers,” he said in the e-mail.  NC Group was established in 2004 and trades natural rubber
and coffee. The company sells 80,000 to 150,000 bags of coffee a
year. Cuong was previously a coffee trader in  Vietnam  with Noble
Group Ltd. A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
