Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , Europe’s
biggest discount airline, is seeking permission to start flights
to Russia, Vedomosti  reported , citing an unidentified official
in the Transport Ministry in Moscow.  Ireland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a request
to the Transport Ministry to allow flights between the two
countries, the newspaper reported today, without specifying
which locations.  Igor Artemyev , head of Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly
Service, last week said the government is considering a plan
to open up the aviation market to foreign low-cost airlines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
