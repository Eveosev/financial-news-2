BMG Rights Management GmbH denied a
report that co-owner  KKR & Co. (KKR)  will leave the music venture if a
bid for some assets of EMI Group’s music business fails.  “There are no immediate plans for a KKR exit from BMG and
nor is there any link between a KKR exit and the outcome of any
EMI-related process,” Ryan O’Keeffe, an external spokesman for
BMG, said in an e-mailed statement today.  U.S. buyout company KKR, which runs BMG together with
Germany’s Bertelsmann SE, may withdraw from the venture if a bid
for EMI’s recorded music assets is unsuccessful, the  New York 
Post reported today, citing unidentified people.  Bertelsmann Chief Executive Officer Thomas Rabe said last
month he wants to expand the BMG music-rights unit and is
considering snapping up assets from EMI’s music business that
may be offered for sale.  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s  Universal Music Group , which agreed to buy the
recorded-music business of EMI, best known as the record label
of the Beatles, plans to sell some parts of that business for
regulatory approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
