Oil traded near a three-month low in
 New York  before a report forecast to show that stockpiles gained
amid surging U.S. production.  Futures were little changed after dropping 2.3 percent
yesterday, the biggest decline since Sept. 19. The Energy
Department will show in a report today that U.S. crude supplies
climbed for a third week, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of analysts. The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute 
reported yesterday that  oil inventories  increased by 313,000
barrels last week to 369.6 million.  Crude for December delivery was unchanged at $86.67 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 8:38 a.m. in Tokyo. The contract fell $2.06 yesterday to its
lowest close since July 10 and is down 12 percent this year.  Brent oil for December settlement dropped $1.19, or 1.1
percent, to end yesterday’s session at $108.25 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European 
benchmark’s premium to the New York-traded West Texas 
Intermediate grade widened to $21.58.  Today’s Energy Department report will probably show that
U.S. crude supplies increased after output climbed to the
highest level in more than  17 years , according to the median of
11 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Crude  inventories  rose by 1.8 million barrels in the week
ended Oct. 19, the survey showed. A gain of that size would
leave stockpiles at the highest level since July. Gasoline
 supplies  climbed 500,000 barrels, the analysts forecast.  Stronger U.S. economic data later this week may spur a
rally in  oil prices , said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige
Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. The
Commerce Department is projected to report that U.S. new home
sales and house prices increased in August, according to a
Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Durable Goods  Orders for durable goods in the U.S. rose 7 percent last
month, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists conducted
before tomorrow’s report from the Commerce Department. The
department may say on Oct. 26 that gross domestic product grew
at a 1.8 percent annual pace in the three months ended Sept. 30,
up from 1.3 percent the previous quarter, economists forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
