China Vanke Co. (000002) , the biggest
developer by market value traded on the nation’s exchanges, said
third-quarter profit more than doubled as it started selling
more residential projects to tap a recovery in home sales.  Net income  jumped 124 percent to 1.35 billion  yuan  ($216
million), or 0.123 yuan a share, the company said in a Shenzhen
stock exchange filing yesterday. Revenue increased 65 percent to
15.4 billion yuan.  China’s new home prices rose for a fourth month in
September after the central bank cut  interest rates  to stem an
economic slowdown and some local authorities eased restrictions
as land-sale revenues fell, according to  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) 
Vanke’s sales by area climbed 8 percent in the first nine months
from a year earlier even as it marketed fewer new apartments,
the company said.  “In light of a rebound in transaction volume in the
market, the company launched more projects during the second
half,” it said in the statement. “Given that the number of
projects to be launched in the fourth quarter will be relatively
large, the company will undoubtedly achieve growth in sales.”  The company’s shares have climbed 12 percent in Shenzhen
trading this year, matching the gain in the gauge tracking
property stocks within the  Shanghai Composite Index. (SHCOMP)   The company, which has 33.3 billion yuan of cash, may seek
more sites, it said. Vanke acquired land to build 5.87 million
square meters (63.2 million square feet) of space in the first
nine months, the company said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
