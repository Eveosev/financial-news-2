Hungary’s  economic-sentiment index 
rose from an eight-month low in October as an improvement in
business confidence outweighed a decline in consumers’ outlook.  The sentiment index rose to minus 24.6 from minus 25 in
September, the GKI research institute in Budapest said in an e-
mailed statement. The  business-confidence  index increased to
minus 14.6 from minus 16.4 while the  consumer confidence  gauge
fell to minus 53 from minus 49.5.  “The pessimism in domestic economic expectations has been
unchanged for the past half year,” GKI said in a statement.
“Within the business sector, only industry confidence
improved.”  Hungary’s economy entered its second recession in four
years in the second quarter, when gross domestic product shrank
1.3 percent from a year earlier. The country requested
International Monetary Fund aid in November as its  credit rating 
was cut to junk.  GKI’s indexes are calculated based on a balance of positive
and negative answers to questions about the outlook for the
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
