Gold futures fell to a six-week low
as the dollar’s advance curbed demand for the metal as an
alternative investment. Palladium tumbled the most since March.  The greenback rose for the fourth straight session, the
longest rally in five months. The euro dropped as  Spain ’s
economy contracted for the fifth straight quarter and French
 industrial confidence  fell to the lowest in more than three
years. Gold has declined 4.1 percent this month.  “Spain continues to drive the direction of the market, and
people are moving toward the dollar and staying away from
riskier assets,” Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity
Trading Corp. in Medford,  Oregon , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1 percent to settle
at $1,709.40 an ounce at 1:48 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price touched $1,705.10, the lowest for a most-
active contract since Sept. 7.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
December delivery plunged 4.6 percent to $593.85 an ounce, the
biggest drop since March 22. Earlier, the metal touched $590.40,
the lowest since Aug. 17.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell 2.3 percent to
$1,575.60 an ounce. The price dropped as low as $1,573.70, the
cheapest since Sept. 7.  Silver futures for December delivery slid 1.4 percent to
$31.793 an ounce on the Comex. The price touched $31.65, the
lowest since Sept. 4.  In 2012, silver has climbed 14 percent. Platinum has gained
12 percent, and gold has advanced 9.1 percent. Palladium has
dropped 9.5 percent.  Today, the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw
materials , which includes gold and silver, erased this year’s
gain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
