United Nations Certified Emission
Reductions and Emission Reduction Units dropped to records as
 Russia  boosted supply and European Union lawmakers proposed six
options to strengthen the bloc’s carbon market.  EU factories and power stations can use UN offset credits
for a portion of their compliance needs. CERs for settlement in
December fell 9.4 percent to 96 euro cents ($1.25) a metric ton
as of 4:59 p.m. on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .
ERUs for the same month plunged 10 percent to 77 cents.  The EU market has a glut of 955 million tons of allowances
and UN credits through 2011, according to a draft report by the
European Commission on the state of the European carbon market
obtained this week by  Bloomberg News . That’s the equivalent of
40 percent of this year’s cap of EU permits.  Russia issued 38 million metric tons of ERUs since Aug. 24,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, citing data on the
website of the Russian carbon registry. The total issued by the
nation stood at 116.96 million tons, according to the website.  CERs for December 2013 dropped 7 percent to 1.20 euros as
of 4:59 p.m. EU allowances for December declined 0.4 percent to
close at 7.88 euros a ton, the lowest since Oct. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
