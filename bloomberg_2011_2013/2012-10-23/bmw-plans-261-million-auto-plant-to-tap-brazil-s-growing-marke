Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest maker of luxury vehicles, will invest 200 million
euros ($261 million) in a Brazil factory to boost sales in the
fast-growing market and to counter  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi.  The factory, to be located in the southern state of Santa
Catarina, is to go online in 2014 and is due to produce as many as
30,000 vehicles a year,  Ian Robertson , BMW’s head of sales and
marketing, told reporters yesterday after a meeting with Brazilian
President  Dilma Rousseff  in Brasilia.  “The investment plan has been aligned with new automobile
industry incentives and is the result of difficult work with
Brazilian authorities during the last six months,” Robertson
said. “The goal is to reach 30,000 cars and to keep growing. If
there is more demand, then there will be more production.”  With car sales declining in Europe and growth in China
slowing, BMW is expanding in  emerging markets  to help boost
deliveries 20 percent to 2 million vehicles by 2016 and fend off
advances by Audi. The Volkswagen unit plans to produce 150,000
cars a year at a new plant in San Jose Chiapa, Mexico.  BMW announced its intention to build a plant in Brazil in
March 2011. The decision was held up by tax changes on imported
vehicles. Demand for high-end vehicles is expected to grow amid
rising wages and as South America’s largest economy invests to
host the soccer  World Cup  in 2014 and the Summer Olympic Games in
2016.  Tax Breaks  Rousseff’s administration on Oct. 4 announced tax breaks for
carmakers that increase investments in Brazil in a bid to revive
its shrinking manufacturing industry.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  has said that auto companies
will invest $22 billion over the next three years in Brazil.
Automakers will have to meet tougher environmental, safety and
fuel efficiency standards in order to get additional tax breaks,
he said Oct.4.  In May, the government cut the so-called IPI tax on cars,
helping drive vehicle sales from this year’s low of 249,500 in
February to a record high 420,100 in August, according to the
national car dealership association. In September, car sales fell
31 percent from the previous month.  BMW’s nine-month sales increased 8.6 percent globally to 1.11
million vehicles, maintaining an edge over Audi, which delivered
1.1 million cars and sport-utility vehicles.  To protect its lead, the Munich-based company is also
expanding production in its sport-utility plant in Spartanburg,
 South Carolina , and has the option of quadrupling local production
in China to 400,000 vehicles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
