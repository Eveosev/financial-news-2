FIFA  has extended its provisional
suspension of Mohamed  Bin Hammam  for another 45 days, soccer’s
ruling body said.  Bin Hammam, the former head of the Asian Football
Confederation, was banned for life by FIFA for allegedly bribing
officials in his bid for the group’s presidency. That was
overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on July 19.  Two days earlier, the Qatari was also provisionally
suspended for 30 days by the Asian confederation after an audit
of the body’s accounts. FIFA then banned him for 90 days and
extended the term today, under a clause in its ethics code that
allows it to do so in exceptional circumstances. It didn’t
specify a reason.  “It is astounding that FIFA is able to keep extending its
ban on the football activities of Mr. Bin Hammam, as it sees
fit,” Eugene Gulland, Bin Hammam’s lawyer, said in a statement.
“FIFA’s latest extension order fails to give any reasons to
justify its action. The basic tenet of law is that a person is
innocent until proven guilty after a trial conducted according
to due process.”  Gulland said in the statement that FIFA’s actions are
political because Bin Hammam ran against Sepp Blatter in the
body’s presidential election last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
