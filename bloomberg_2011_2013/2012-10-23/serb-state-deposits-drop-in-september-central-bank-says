Serbian government  deposits  held at
the central bank fell to the lowest in two years in September,
the month before  Serbia  cashed in a new $1 billion Eurobond.  Combined foreign-currency and dinar deposits dropped to
81.4 billion dinars ($932 million) at the end of September, from
100.9 billion dinars in August, according to data provided by
the Belgrade-based National Bank of Serbia today.  The foreign-currency deposits, calculated in dinars,
dropped 30 percent on the month to 32.6 billion dinars, the
lowest since July 2006. Dinar deposits contracted 10 percent to
48.8 billion dinars in the same period.  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, in office since July,
ended September with a monthly fiscal deficit of 22.07 billion
dinars, double the shortfall in August, according to Finance
Ministry figures.  Serbia’s full-year fiscal gap is expected to reach 203.5
billion dinars at the end of 2012, equivalent to 6.7 percent of
gross domestic product and down from 7.1 percent at the end of
June. The nine-month deficit reached 145.2 billion dinars.  Serbia borrowed the equivalent of $305 million in September
on the local market, less than half the monthly plan of $696.5
million, according to the Debt Management Agency.  The government reopened its 2021 Eurobond on Sept. 27 and
raised $1 billion, which will show up on public accounts at the
end of October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
