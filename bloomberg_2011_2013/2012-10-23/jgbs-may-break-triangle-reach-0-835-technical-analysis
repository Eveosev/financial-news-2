Yields on  Japan ’s 10-year government
bonds may rise to 0.835 percent, the highest level in almost six
weeks, should it break out of a so-called triangle formation,
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. said.  Benchmark rates are moving within a narrow range and have
formed the technical pattern, according to Naomi Muguruma, a
senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley.
The top of the triangle consists of a downward sloping trendline
connecting the peaks of 0.86 percent on Aug. 17, 0.835 percent
on Sept. 13, and 0.795 percent on Oct. 18. The triangle’s bottom
trendline slopes upward, connecting the troughs of 0.72 percent
on July 23 and 0.755 percent on Oct. 16.  The 10-year bond yield ended yesterday at 0.78 percent,
unchanged from the previous day’s closing level.  “After having formed a triangle, yields could break
outside the range” of about 0.75 percent to 0.80 percent set in
October, Muguruma said. “If they breach the key level of 0.8
percent, they’ll probably climb toward resistance at 0.835
percent. The next target would then be 0.86 percent.”  A triangle pattern is formed when upper and lower trend
lines intersect. In  technical analysis , investors and analysts
study charts of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes
in a security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
