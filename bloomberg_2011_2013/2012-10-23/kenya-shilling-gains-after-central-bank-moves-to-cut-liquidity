Kenya ’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar after the central bank reduced market
liquidity through the first sale of six-day  repurchase
agreements  this year.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 1.2 percent to 84.24 per dollar, the biggest intraday
gain since Oct. 17. It was trading 0.2 percent stronger at 85.10
per dollar at 5:21 p.m. in Nairobi, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 3.45 billion shillings
($40.5 million) of seven-day repurchase agreements, an official
who asked not to be identified in line with policy, said by
phone. It later sold 4.5 billion shillings of six-day repurchase
agreements, the official said.  “The shilling held steady against the dollar with market
players expecting the local currency to remain supported by
tightening liquidity,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in an
e-mailed note to clients.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.3 percent to 1,584 per
dollar, while the Ugandan shilling depreciated by 0.5 percent to
2,595 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
