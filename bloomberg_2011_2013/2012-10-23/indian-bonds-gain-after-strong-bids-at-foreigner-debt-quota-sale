Indian government bonds advanced,
pushing the 10-year yield to the lowest in almost three months,
after the nation sold 227.8 billion ($4.3 billion) of debt-
purchase permits to foreign investors yesterday. The rupee fell.  Global funds paid a minimum fee of 5.3 basis points for the
right to buy government notes without any tenor restrictions at
the monthly sale, according to two people familiar with the
matter. That would be the highest since June, regulator data
show. The minimum rate for corporate debt was 5.8 basis points.  “Compared with previous auctions, quotas for both
government and corporate bonds received strong bids,” analysts
at Barclays Plc, including Singapore-based Rohit Arora, wrote in
a research report today. “We continue to recommend being
overweight Indian government bonds.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent notes due June 2022
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.13 percent
as of 9:41 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. That’s the lowest level since July 27.  The rupee dropped 0.1 percent to 53.5050 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a gauge of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, fell 12 basis points to 10.88 percent.  Importers may boost purchases of dollars today to meet
payments as the market will be shut tomorrow for a local holiday,
said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at Andhra Bank in Mumbai.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 54.30 per dollar,
compared with 54.45 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were at 54.25
versus 54.31. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
