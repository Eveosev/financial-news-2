Spain ’s government bonds fell for a
third day after the central bank said gross domestic product
shrank for a fifth quarter, harming the nation’s ability to
repay its debt.  Spain’s 10-year yields climbed the most in a week after the
budget ministry said the deficit would reach 7.3 percent of GDP
this year due to cost of bank bailouts, which aren’t counted by
the European Union when assessing targets. German bunds rose
after European Central Bank Governing Council member Yves Mersch
said bond purchases of bailed-out countries would be limited in
time, spurring demand for the region’s safest assets. Spain sold
bills and  Finland  auctioned bonds.  “The deficit miss will be another in a succession of
budget targets which the Spanish government have failed to
achieve,” said  Brian Barry , a fixed-income analyst at Investec
Bank Plc in  London . “Any figures which suggest a worsening of
debt dynamics beyond previously forecast levels could impact
Spanish bonds.”  Spain’s 10-year yield rose 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 5.62 percent at 5 p.m. in London after
gaining as much as 15 basis points, the most since Oct. 15. The
5.85 percent bond due in January 2022 fell 0.93, or 9.30 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,297) face amount, to 101.565.  Spanish GDP shrank 0.4 percent from the previous three
months, matching the second-quarter contraction, the Bank of
Spain said in its monthly bulletin. The budget ministry said
without the bank bailout costs, the deficit would meet the
target of 6.3 percent, according to an e-mailed statement.  Losing Streak  Spain’s bonds have fallen each day since Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  said on Oct. 19 he’s not facing pressure to seek a
sovereign bailout, a condition of ECB debt purchases.  “The market is realizing that a Spanish bailout request
will happen later rather than sooner,” and that is pushing up
Spanish yields, said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist
at Commerzbank AG in London. “The market would like to have
clarity on the matter.”  Mersch, who heads Luxembourg’s central bank, said there’s
no “quantitative determination of volume” of bond purchases,
and the ECB “has not lost sight of risk management.” ECB
governing council member Klaas Knot told the Dutch Parliament
today that the central bank’s previous debt-purchase program had
a “limited and temporary effect.”  Greek Opposition  Bonds of so-called peripheral nations declined as Greek
Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s race to secure 31 billion euros
of international aid ran into renewed opposition from his
coalition partners.  Evangelos Venizelos  of Pasok and the Democratic Left’s
Fotis Kouvelis, whose parliamentary seats give Samaras the
majority he needs to govern, both said further rollback of labor
rules would be unacceptable after a meeting with the prime
minister in  Athens .  The yield on 10-year  Italian bonds  rose 10 basis points to
4.87 percent, while Greek  10-year yields  jumped 47 basis points
to 17.05 percent.  Spain sold three-month bills at an average yield of 1.415
percent, up from 1.203 percent at a previous auction on Sept.
25. Investors bid for 4.32 times the amount allocated, up from
3.29 times last month. The government sold six-month securities
at 2.023 percent, versus 2.213 percent in September.  The additional yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-
year securities over their German counterparts widened 18 basis
points to 405 basis points.  ‘Big Divergence’  “We repeatedly see a big divergence between the short-term
relief of debt sales being well attended, and the longer-term
reality,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch in London. “With such disparate yields
between core and periphery, the doubts about ultimate
sustainability and the ability to continue financing debt in the
weaker countries intensify.”  Germany ’s  10-year yield  fell five basis points to 1.57
percent after climbing to 1.66 percent on Oct. 18, the highest
since Sept. 19.  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today after Greece and Spain, according to measures of
10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Finland auctioned 1.5 billion euros of 10- and 30-year
bonds, with the September 2022 securities drawing an average
yield of 1.806 percent. The sale attracted bids for 1.8 times
the amount allotted. Investors bought July 2042 debt at a yield
of 2.588 percent.  Finland’s  10-year bond yield  declined five basis points to
1.81 percent.  The European Union sold 3 billion euros of securities due
in 2027 at a sale via banks. The bonds were priced at 36 basis
points above the mid-swap rate.  German bonds returned 2.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spain’s
securities rose 3.2 percent and Finland’s gained 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
