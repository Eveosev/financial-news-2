Treasury  10-year yields  are poised
to rise to the highest level in five months after breaching two
levels of so-called resistance, Credit Suisse Group AG said,
citing trading patterns.  The yield is set to extend its increase after breaking
above the 1.75 percent level last week, which marks the high
reached earlier this month, and closing above the  200-day moving
average  at 1.80 percent yesterday, said  David Sneddon , a
technical analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in  London .  “The U.S. 10-year managed to hold above the 1.75 percent
breakout point,” Sneddon said in a telephone interview. “This
leaves us still bearish,” he said, referring to a view that
prices will fall and yields will keep rising.  The 10-year  Treasury yield  dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.77 percent at 8:14 a.m. in  New York .
It rose to 1.83 percent on Oct. 18, the highest since Sept. 18.  An increase above last week’s high would open the way for
the yield to rise to 1.90 percent, Sneddon said. That would take
it past the 1.89 percent level, which marks the 50 percent
retracement of its decline from this year’s high of 2.40 percent
on March 20 to the 2012 low of 1.38 percent on July 25, he said.
The yield was last at 1.90 percent on May 10.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance indicates that a yield may move to the
next level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
