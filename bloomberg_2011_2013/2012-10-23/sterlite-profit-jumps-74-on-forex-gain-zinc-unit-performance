Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) ,
the nation’s biggest copper producer, posted a better-than-
expected 74 percent increase in second-quarter profit boosted by
earnings at its zinc unit and a foreign exchange gain.  Group  net income  rose to 17.4 billion rupees ($324
million), or 4.8 rupees a share, in the three months ended Sept.
30, from 9.98 billion rupees, or 2.97 rupees, a year earlier,
the  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  unit said today in a statement to
 stock exchanges . The median profit of 26 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was 12.2 billion rupees. Sales gained 9
percent to 110.3 billion rupees.  On Oct. 18, Sterlite unit  Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZ) , the nation’s
largest producer of the metal, reported a 15 percent gain in
profit in the three months ending Sept. 30 on higher silver and
lead production.  Sterlite’s earnings before tax and interest from commercial
power sales from a plant in the state of Odisha rose almost
fourfold to 1.9 billion rupees, it said. The company, based in
the southern city of Tuticorin, posted a foreign exchange gain

base metals such as aluminum fell. The average price of the
metal, used to make aircraft and beverage cans, declined 20
percent to $1,950 a metric ton in the period from a year before.
Copper fell 14 percent in the three months on the London Metal
