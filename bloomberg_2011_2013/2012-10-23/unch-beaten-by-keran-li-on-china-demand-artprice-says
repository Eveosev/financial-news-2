Works by  Edvard Munch , the most
valuable artist at auction, have increased in value at a slower
pace over the past decade than those by China’s Keran Li,
according to research company Artprice.  While Munch’s “The Scream” became the world’s most
expensive artwork at auction when it raised $119.9 million with
fees at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in May, the Norwegian artist’s  price index  has
risen less since 2001 than Li, the French-based company’s data
says. The pastel work, one of the most copied images in art,
goes on show at the Museum of  Modern Art  in New York today.  Li’s market charge is led by the $40.3 million paid for
“Mountains in Red” at  Poly International , Beijing, in March.
The figures reflect the global art market which, including
auction and dealer sales, was worth 46.1 billion euros ($60
billion) in 2011, according to a report published by the
Netherlands-based European Fine Art Foundation (Tefaf) in March.  “Li is one of  China ’s top four traditional ink painters,”
the Paris-based dealer  Christian Ogier  said in an interview. “He
meets the aspiration of traditional collectors for something
more modern, yet understandable. He lived in Beijing, and
retains a loyal following in the northern part of the country,
where a number of collectors live.”  Artprice’s figures were produced before this month’s tests
of the art market, with about $500 million of works on sale in
Hong Kong and more than $2 billion at fairs, auctions and
gallery shows in London and Paris.  Its index, starting at 100 in 2001, rose to 812 for Munch,
a figure partly distorted by the one-time sale of one of the
most famous images in the world, dealers said.  Chinese Demand  Li is one of a group of Chinese 20th-century artists
working in an idiom that fetches high prices in China’s domestic
auctions. While only five of his works sold outside  Asia  in
2011, domestic demand makes him more consistently valuable --
only 13 percent of his lots failed to sell in that year -- and
he rose to 947 on the Artprice index last month.  In 2001, as the  Hong Kong  Museum of Art organized 
“Magnificent Vision,” a retrospective show of Li’s work 12 
years after his death, he was only at 345 in Artprice’s top 100.  Artprice also listed the 10 most valuable paintings and
works of art at auction in the first half of 2012. The Munch led
the list, selling for $107,000 million at hammer price before
fees. One of four versions of the image, it was bought by  Leon Black , chairman and founder of Apollo Global Management LLC, the
Wall Street Journal earlier reported on its website.  Otherwise, postwar works were the billionaires’ choice in
the first half of 2012. Seven out of 10 were paintings from the
1960s.  Rothko, Bacon  “The Scream” was followed by  Mark Rothko ’s 1961 “Orange,
Red, Yellow” for a $77.5 million hammer price at Christie’s
International New York, also in May; Li’s “Mountains in Red”
and works by Bacon, Lichtenstein, Warhol, Miro and Klein.  Artprice  didn’t have enough works at auction to include
Rothko in its index. No work by  Pablo Picasso , ranked by
artprice.com as the world’s most expensive artist in 2010,
featured in the list. His index on Artprice is at 212 in 2012.  Sales of contemporary art in the world’s 10 biggest auction
centers raised about $1.2 billion in 2011, still down from the
levels of 2008, artprice.com said.  Since that decline in the market, auction catalogs of
contemporary art in the U.S. and  Europe  have become more
weighted with 20th-century classics, rather than works by
younger living artists.  New York  was the biggest center for auctions of
contemporary art in 2011 with sales of $307.4 million. London,
which holds three series of auctions per year, raised $264.1
million, an advance of 67 percent on 2010.  London Residents  The U.K. capital’s population of wealthy foreign residents
is attracting sellers of high-value lots.  Last year, China overtook the U.S. for the first time to
become the biggest art and antiques market worldwide with 9.8
billion euros of auction sales, according to the Tefaf report.  This is reflected in the Artprice figures, with Beijing
selling $265.7 million, Hong Kong $213.4 million and  Shanghai 
$39 million last year -- giving Asia a higher sales total than
any other continent.  Muse highlights include  Rich Jaroslovsky  on technology and
