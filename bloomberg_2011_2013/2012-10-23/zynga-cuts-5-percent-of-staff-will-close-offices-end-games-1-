Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , the social-game maker that held an initial public offering last year, is cutting 5 percent of staff, shutting offices and ending more than a dozen titles to compensate for slowing sales growth.  San Francisco-based Zynga is closing an office in  Boston , trimming staff in Austin,  Texas  and weighing the closure of studios in  Japan  and the U.K., Chief Executive Officer  Mark Pincus  wrote yesterday in a memo obtained by Bloomberg. The cuts affect about 142 of the 2,846  workers  Zynga had at the end of 2011.  Zynga has  fallen  78 percent since the December IPO on disappointing demand for its games on  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and a failure to produce runaway hits for wireless devices. Trimming staff may help the company do a better job focusing on mobile games, said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co.  “As much as headcount reductions are painful, I think it’s a necessary alignment of their resources,” said Sebastian, who has a neutral rating on Zynga. “They were overstaffed in core social gaming. There needs to be a more aggressive transition into mobile games.”  The company, scheduled to release third-quarter results later, will probably report a net loss of $87.4 million on sales of $291.5 million, the average of analysts’ predictions compiled by Bloomberg. The company reported a profit of $12.5 million on sales of $306.8 million a year earlier.  Zynga cut its forecast for full-year bookings, a predictor of sales, this month, citing lower demand for titles such as “The Ville.”  Sales Forecast  The company said at the time that it expects to report a net loss of $90 million to $105 million for the third quarter. Excluding some items, it will break even or post a loss of 1 cent a share. Third-quarter revenue was $300 million to $305 million, Zynga said.  Shares of Zynga fell 5.2 percent to $2.20 at the close yesterday in  New York  as news of the cost reductions began trickling out to blogs and news services.  “We initiated a number of changes to streamline our operations, focus our resources on our most strategic opportunities, and invest in our future,” Pincus wrote in the memo. “As part of these changes, we’ve had to make some tough decisions around products, teams and people.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Douglas MacMillan in  San Francisco  at   dmacmillan3@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at   tgiles5@bloomberg.net
