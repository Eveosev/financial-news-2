Gasoline rebounded in New York on
speculation that the longest losing streak in 25 years was
exaggerated.  Futures climbed as much as 0.9 percent after sinking to a
four-month low yesterday. The fuel is down 22 percent this month
after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  and Citgo Petroleum
Corp. started refinery units following outages. Inventories rose
in the week ended Oct. 19, while demand fell 5 percent, the
American Petroleum Institute said late yesterday.  “Today is a good day to buy back after a long series of
declines,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity-derivatives sales
manager at Newedge Group in  Tokyo . “There is no supply shortage
at the moment, so the market came down sharply for nine days.
Now is a good time to buy back, not only gasoline, but WTI and
Brent as well.”  Refineries are starting units after repairs, indicating
supplies will increase and prices may drop more as the U.S.
approaches the Nov. 6 presidential election, where incumbent
President  Barack Obama  faces Republican challenger  Mitt Romney .  Obama supports increasing fuel-efficiency standards for
vehicles, while Romney accuses him of impeding oil producers.
The International Energy Agency, adviser to 28 advanced
economies, said oil prices are too high and threaten to derail
the global economic recovery.  Rebounding Today  Gasoline for November delivery advanced as much as 2.44
cents to $2.6294 a gallon in electronic trading today on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and was at $2.6252 at 10:32 a.m.  London 
time. The contract settled yesterday at $2.605, the lowest
settlement since June 22. Yesterday’s decline was the ninth
straight day of losses, representing the longest down streak
since August 1987.  The futures contract traded in the 1980s and 1990s was
phased out in 2006 and replaced with one that allowed blending
with ethanol, after several states banned the use of methyl
tertiary butyl ether because of groundwater contamination.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery swung
between gains and losses today on the Nymex and was up 13 cents
at $86.80 a barrel at 10:32 a.m. London time. Front-month Brent
oil prices on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange were up 46
cents at $108.71, following six days of declines.  Retail Prices  The average nationwide price for  regular gasoline  at the
pump declined 2.3 cents to $3.625 a gallon yesterday, AAA, the
largest U.S. motoring organization, said today on its website.
That’s the lowest level since Aug. 5 and prices have fallen
every day since Oct. 10. The pump price reached a 2012 high of
$3.936 on April 4.  By election day, the national average will slide to about
$3.40 to $3.50, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA  said  on Oct. 22.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  rose two weeks ago, after falling
10 of the prior 11 weeks, according to Energy Department data.
The department’s next report, for the week ended Oct. 19, will
probably show that supplies climbed 500,000 barrels, according
to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg
News. The forecast compares with a 181,000-barrel gain reported
by the API after prices settled yesterday. The government
department’s data release is at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time today.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines,
while the government requires that companies files reports for
its weekly survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
