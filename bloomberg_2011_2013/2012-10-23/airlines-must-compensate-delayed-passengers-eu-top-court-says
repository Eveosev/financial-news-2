Airlines are obliged to compensate
passengers who have been delayed by more than three hours, the
European Union’s highest court said in a ruling that confirms an
earlier, precedent-setting decision by the court.  “Where passengers reach their final destination three
hours or more after the scheduled arrival time, they may claim
fixed compensation from the airline, unless the delay is caused
by extraordinary circumstances,” the EU Court of Justice in
Luxembourg said in a ruling today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
