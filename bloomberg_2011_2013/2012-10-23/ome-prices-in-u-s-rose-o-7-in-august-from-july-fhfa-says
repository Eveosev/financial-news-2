U.S. house prices rose 0.7 percent
in August from July as buyers competed for a dwindling supply of
property listings, the  Federal Housing Finance Agency  said.  The average estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey
was for a 0.4 percent gain. Prices climbed 4.7 percent from a
year earlier, according to the FHFA. The previously reported 0.2
percent increase in July was revised downward to a 0.1 percent
gain. The agency posted the data on its website late yesterday,
a day before its regularly scheduled release date.  The FHFA’s index has climbed as improving  employment , a
tight inventory of available homes and record-low borrowing
costs help strengthen a real estate recovery. A home value index
by Zillow Inc. jumped 1.3 percent in the third quarter from the
previous three months, the biggest gain since 2006, the Seattle-
based property-data company reported yesterday.  The FHFA report was inadvertently released early because of
a “technical, systems error,” according to Denise Dunckel,
senior associate director for congressional affairs and
communications. It was scheduled to appear on the agency’s
website at 10 a.m. today.  The FHFA data, which is based on single-family houses with
mortgages backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, doesn’t provide a
specific price. The  median price  of an existing single-family
home, as measured by the National Association of Realtors, was
$188,700 in August, up 10 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
