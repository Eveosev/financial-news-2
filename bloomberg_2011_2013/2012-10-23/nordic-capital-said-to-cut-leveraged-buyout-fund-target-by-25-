Nordic Capital, a Swedish private-
equity firm, told investors it will seek 25 percent less than
the 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) it initially targeted for its
latest buyout fund, two people with knowledge of the talks said.  Nordic Capital will now ask for 3 billion euros or at most
3.5 billion euros, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the matter is private. The Stockholm-based
firm plans to reach a so-called first close at about half the
target by the year-end, allowing it to start investing the
money, before completing the fundraising by April, they said.  Nordic Capital began marketing the fund in April after
Stockholm-based EQT Partners AB year last year raised 4.75
billion euros, the maximum it sought, for a fund focused on
Northern Europe. Investors have less money to commit to buyout
funds after the European sovereign debt crisis hindered asset
sales, preventing firms from returning cash to investors.  Nordic Capital’s previous fund, a 4.3 billion-euro pool
raised in 2008, was valued at a loss as at the end March,
according to the Washington State Investment Board, an investor
in the fund. The pool has since recovered, and Nordic Capital
told investors it was valued at a 20 percent gain as of June 30,
according to one of the fund’s backers.  The decision to cut the fundraising target was reported by
Private Equity News yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
