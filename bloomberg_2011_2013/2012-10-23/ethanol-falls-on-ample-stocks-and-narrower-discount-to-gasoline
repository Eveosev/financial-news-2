Ethanol fell for a second day in
Chicago after supplies of the fuel grew and as its discount to
gasoline narrowed.  Futures slipped as the spread between the biofuel and
gasoline slid to 19.9 cents based on settlement prices, the
lowest since July 18, making it less attractive to blend the
two. Ethanol  inventories  in the week ended Oct. 12 were 11
percent higher than a year earlier, the Energy Department said
in its most recent supply report.  “That blend margin has come in,” said  Ian Jackson , a
trader at SCB & Associates in Chicago. “Physically, it feels
tight, but if you look at it on a stocks basis we’re nowhere
near scary levels.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery declined 1.9 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.406 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have gained 9.2 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago decreased 3.5
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.40 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive dropped 3.5 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.545, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slid 3.5 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
$2.455 a gallon and in  New York  it fell 3 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $2.47.  Gasoline Futures  Gasoline for November delivery tumbled 4.25 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.605 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  The motor fuel traded at a 99.8 cent premium to ethanol as
recently as Sept. 28.  Corn for December delivery fell 5.25 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $7.56 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 36 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
