Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the worldâ€™s largest
producer of motor fuel from coal, hired Barclays Plc, HSBC
Holdings Ltd. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to arrange meetings with
U.S. and European bond investors.  The meetings, which start on Oct. 25, may be followed by
the sale of debt securities, Johannesburg-based Sasol said in an
e-mailed statement today. The company said yesterday it filed a
shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to sell debt abroad.  Sasol is planning its first sale of dollar bonds to lower
the cost of gas-to-liquid plants it is considering building in
the U.S. and  Canada , the Johannesburg-based company said on
Sept. 10. The second-largest South African company by market
value after  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN)  plans to raise debt to as much as 40
percent of equity within three to five years, from 2.7 percent
at the end of June, the company said. Sasol has a market value
of 239 billion rand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
