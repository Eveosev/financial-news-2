Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index bound for a third day of losses, after companies
including  Acer (2353)  Inc. posted earnings that missed estimates and
Moody’s Investors Service lowered credit ratings on five Spanish
regions.  Acer slid 3.5 percent in Taipei as Asia’s second-largest
computer maker posted third-quarter profit and sales that missed
estimates. Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets about 31 percent
of sales from Europe, dropped 1.5 percent in Tokyo.  Kansai
Electric Power Co. (9503)  slumped 13 percent after the Nikkei newspaper
reported the Japanese utility won’t pay a dividend.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.5 percent to 122.59 as
of 9:02 p.m. in Tokyo, erasing gains of as much as 0.3 percent.
Almost two shares dropped for each that climbed on the measure.
The gauge rebounded 13 percent from this year’s low on June 4
through yesterday as stimulus measures in the U.S., Japan and
China boosted market sentiment amid a global economic slowdown
and Europe’s debt crisis.  “External factors such as the European debt crisis and the
U.S. elections are still the biggest risks for the market,”
said  Angus Gluskie , managing director at White Funds Management
in Sydney, which manages more than $350 million. “Earnings are
hostage to these macroeconomic factors.”  Of the 47 companies on the regional benchmark index that
reported quarterly earnings since Oct. 1, about 57 percent
missed analyst estimates, while 43 percent surpassed
expectations, according to  data  compiled by  Bloomberg News . More
than 100 companies in Australia, China, India, Japan,  South
Korea  and Taiwan are scheduled to post results this week.  Weaker Yen  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  decreased 0.8 percent. Taiwan’s
 Taiex Index  slipped 0.5 percent and China’s Shanghai Composite
Index declined 0.9 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained
0.1 percent. Hong Kong markets are closed for a holiday.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose less than 0.1 percent
as exporters advanced after the yen touched a three-month low.
The gains were capped as  Kansai Electric  led the nation’s
utilities lower.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 1.1
percent today. The gauge rose less than 0.1 percent yesterday in
New York, reversing an earlier loss of 0.8 percent, as an
advance in Apple Inc. shares outweighed disappointing corporate
results.  Acer slid 3.5 percent to NT$26 in Taipei. The company
posted third-quarter net income of NT$68 million ($2.3 million),
less than the NT$503 million average of 18 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings Forecast  GS Yuasa Corp. (6674)  plunged 13 percent to 314 yen in Tokyo after
the battery maker cut its net-income forecast by 39 percent to 8
billion yen ($100.1 million) for the year ending March 31, hurt
by a plunge in sales of lithium ion batteries used in electric
cars.  SMS Management & Technology Ltd. (SMX)  tumbled 23 percent to
A$4.95 in Sydney after the information-technology company said
it expects slower first-quarter sales growth.  Pacific Brands Ltd. (PBG)  slid 4.5 percent to 53 Australian cents
after the underwear maker said the business environment isn’t
showing signs of improvement, citing a decline in underlying
sales year-to-date.  Companies that do business in Europe declined after Moody’s
lowered its credit rating for Catalonia and four other Spanish
regions, citing “deterioration in their liquidity positions.”
Concerns about the country’s creditworthiness have grown since
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  requested as much as 100 billion
euros ($130 billion) in European Union aid to shore up Spanish
lenders amid signs the nation may miss its budget deficit goals.  Posco Downgrade  Canon slid 1.5 percent to 2,613 yen in Tokyo.  SK Hynix
Inc. (000660) , a maker of computer memory chips that gets about 13
percent of sales from Europe, fell 1.5 percent to 23,050 won in
Seoul.  Posco (005490) , Asia’s third-biggest steelmaker by output, slid 2.1
percent to 348,500 won after Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
downgraded its credit rating, citing the company’s weakening
operating performance.  Kansai Electric slumped 13 percent to 595 yen after the
Nikkei newspaper reported the utility won’t pay a year-end
dividend for the first time since 1951, as earnings are unlikely
to recover on rising costs of fuel to cover halted nuclear
reactors. Kansai Electric said in a release it hasn’t decided on
the year-end dividend payout.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)   traded  at 13 times estimated
earnings as of yesterday, compared with 13.7 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Apple’s iPad  Among stocks that rose,  LG Display Co. (034220) , the world’s second-
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, advanced 1.9 percent
to 30,050 won in Seoul after winning a U.S. patent infringement
case and amid speculation sales may be boosted by a new iPad to
be unveiled today by customer Apple Inc.  “The portion of specialty panels in LG Display’s sales
will rise in the fourth quarter, helped by supplies for the iPad
Mini and iPhone 5,” Jeff Kang, an analyst at Daishin Securities
Co., wrote in a report today. Kang, who has a buy rating on LG
Display, raised the stock-price estimate by 17 percent to 42,000
won.  Japanese exporters gained after the yen depreciated to as
low as 80.01 against the dollar today in Tokyo, the weakest
since July 6. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income
at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Nikon Corp. (7731) , a camera maker that gets about 85 percent of
its sales overseas, gained 1.6 percent to 2,044 yen. Fanuc
Corp., a maker of factory robotics, climbed 1.9 percent to
13,200 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
