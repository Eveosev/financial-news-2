German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said that  Greece  will have a chance to return to
sustainable public finances with “mechanisms” to be put in
place by its international creditors.  Schaeuble, in a speech at a machine makers’ event in Berlin
today, warned that  Europe ’s prestige may suffer if it fails to
resolve the crisis in Greece more than three years after it
played host to the beginnings of the sovereign debt crisis.  “It will be politically difficult for Greece to accept,”
Schaeuble said. Yet in “weighing up the advantages and
disadvantages” of the options this year, “I say it can be done
with the appropriate mechanisms.”  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has pledged to do all she can to
help keep Greece in the euro. While her government will wait for
the report by the so-called troika of international inspectors
before assessing Greece’s fate, the decision on continued aid
should be guided in part by the potential consequences for
Europe’s image in the world, Schaeuble said.  Measures already introduced between euro-region governments
and the  International Monetary Fund  should be strengthened, “in
the sense of control mechanisms, perhaps automatic
stabilizers,” to give Greece more than a chance to recover,
Schaeuble said. He didn’t elaborate.  “In weighing this up, consider also what people --
economic subjects, market participants, investors -- in other
parts of the world would think when big, strong Europe” isn’t
able to solve the problems posed by such a small country as
Greece, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
