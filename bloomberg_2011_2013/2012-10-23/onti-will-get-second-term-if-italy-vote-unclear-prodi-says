Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ,
who has declined to run for a second term, may be reappointed if
voters fail to give sufficient backing to one of the candidates
in next year’s elections, Romano Prodi said.  “If there is no clear winner, Mr. Monti will be again
prime minister,” Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, said
in a Bloomberg Television interview with  Guy Johnson  today. “He
has been an excellent prime minister.”  Monti has helped contain Italy’s borrowing costs since
being called to power in November after the resignation of
former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi . His caretaker
government is supported in parliament by Italy’s two main
political parties, which pledged to cooperate until the
elections, which are due by April.  If neither party wins enough votes to lead a government
without the other, Monti has said he is open to serving again.  “If there is a situation in which you have not a clear
outcome, there is no other choice,” Prodi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
