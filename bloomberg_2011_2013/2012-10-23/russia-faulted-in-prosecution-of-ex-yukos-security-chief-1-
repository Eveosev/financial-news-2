Russia  violated the rights of Alexei Pichugin, the former security chief at Yukos Oil Co. who is
serving a life sentence for murder, the European Court of  Human
Rights  ruled.  Pichugin’s rights to a fair trial and liberty were breached
during Russia’s prosecution of him on charges of murder and
attempted murder, the Strasbourg, France-based court said today
in a statement.  Pichugin was arrested in 2003 and convicted in 2005, a
decision that was upheld by a higher court, according to a
summary of his appeal. Pichugin claimed he was arrested
“without a reasonable suspicion” and that his detention for
nearly two years before trial was unlawful. He also argued that
the trial was conducted unfairly.  The human rights court found five violations of his rights,
including the “excessive length of the proceedings” on his
appeals against his pre-trial detention. The court also faulted
the lack of public hearings and inability to adequately
challenge witnesses. Pichugin was awarded 9,500 euros ($12,360)
in damages and costs.  “The  European Court  found that only an insignificant part
of applicant’s rights were violated,” the Russian Ministry of
Justice said in an e-mailed statement.  The human rights court found in favor of Russia on two
points. One concerned the ban on detaining people without
reasonable suspicion, and the second the length of appeals on
2003 detention orders.  Ksenia Kostromina, Pichugin’s lawyer, said she is satisfied
that with court’s ruling, and there is “a basis for reduction
of his sentence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
