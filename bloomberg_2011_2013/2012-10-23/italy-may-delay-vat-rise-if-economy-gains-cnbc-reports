 The Italian government could delay
a planned increase in the value-added tax to 22 percent should
economic conditions improve, Undersecretary for Finance
Gianfranco Polillo told Class CNBC in a television interview.  “Should the economic situation improve in the coming
months, the increase in VAT by 1 percentage point in July 2013
could be frozen,” Polillo said on Class CNBC today.  Polillo also said the government is trying to “resolve the
problems that have affected the management of Finmeccanica,
separating those issues from the good working of the company.”
 Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  is being targeted in corruption investigations
in  Italy  that contributed to the resignation of Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, the former chairman and chief executive officer of
the country’s largest defense contractor. The probes also
involve current executives.  The state-controlled company is a “strategic asset for the
government” and, as is the case with  Enel SpA (ENEL)  and  Eni SpA (ENI) ,
“for the time being we aren’t talking about selling them off,”
though “you can never say never,” Polillo said in the
interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
