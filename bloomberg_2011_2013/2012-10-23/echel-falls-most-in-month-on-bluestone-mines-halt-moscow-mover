OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  dropped the most in four
weeks on concern Russia’s largest producer of coal for
steelmaking will lose revenue after halting mines at its
Bluestone complex in the U.S.  Mechel retreated 3.9 percent to 211.50 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the biggest decline since Sept. 26. The volume of
shares traded was 1.1 million, equivalent to about 94 percent of
the three-month daily average. The stock fell as much as 4.4
percent earlier.  Mechel temporarily suspended mining at some facilities of
its Bluestone mining complex, including Keystone, Justice Energy
and Dynamic Energy, citing “accumulated” coal inventories, the
company said in a statement yesterday. The coal miner expects
operations to resume in two to three months, according to the
statement.  “The explanation for the move is weak demand coupled with
rising unsold inventory,” Alfa Bank analysts led by Barry Ehrlich, said in an e-mailed report. “We see the news as
negative.” The halt may result in about $120 million in lost
revenue, Alfa Bank said.  Mechel has slumped 22 percent this year and  trades  at 11
times estimated earnings, compared with 13 times for  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company. Mechel’s
American depositary receipts lost 0.9 percent to $6.92
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
