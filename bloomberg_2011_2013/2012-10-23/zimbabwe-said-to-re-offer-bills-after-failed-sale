The  Reserve Bank  of Zimbabwe will
offer $15 million of Treasury bills tomorrow in a second attempt
to sell the first central bank securities since the country
abandoned its currency in favor of the dollar in 2009, an
official at the institution said.  An Oct. 4 offer of the same amount of 91-day bills failed
after the Harare-based central bank rejected $7.7 million worth
of bids with yields ranging from 5.5 percent to 15 percent, the
official said, declining to be identified because he is not
authorized to speak to the press. Treasury bills were last sold
in 2008.  The southern African nation is rebuilding its economy and
trying to resume normal treasury operations after the inflation
rate rose to 500 billion percent, according to the  International
Monetary Fund . The Zimbabwe dollar fell to 12.6 trillion per
 U.S. dollar .  Calls to the central bank outside of normal office hours
werenâ€™t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
