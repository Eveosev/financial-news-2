Crude oil options volatility slipped
as underlying futures tumbled a fourth day to the lowest level
since July.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
December, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.76 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 3:30 p.m., down from 32.67 percent
yesterday.  Puts were more active than calls, accounting for 53 percent
of volume in electronic trading. The market maintained a put
skew, with implied volatility on puts that protect against a 10
percent decline in December futures at 36.54 percent, compared
with 30.07 percent for calls protecting against a 10 percent
rise, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 3:20 p.m.  “We’re breaking down out of a range to the lowest level
since early summer and there were a lot of puts trading,” said
Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New
York .  Rigolini said he saw trading in $72 and $75 puts for
December and January and December $80 puts.  December-delivery crude oil fell $1.98, or 2.2 percent, to
$86.67 a barrel, the lowest settlement since July 12.  Most-Active  The most active options in electronic trading today were

3,906 lots trading. December $100 calls were the second-most
active, with 3,506 lots exchanged as they fell 8 cents to 8
cents a barrel.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
