European stocks  declined for a third
day, with the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  sliding to its lowest level
in almost seven weeks as results from companies including Alfa
Laval AB and  D.E Master Blenders (DE)  1753 NV disappointed investors.  Alfa Laval and D.E Master Blenders fell at least 5 percent
each.  Mulberry Group Plc (MUL)  plunged 24 percent after unexpectedly
saying profit will fall. Chemical makers including  Arkema SA (AKE) 
tumbled after DuPont Co.’s earnings lagged forecasts.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 1.7 percent to 268.40 at
the close of trading, its lowest level since Sept. 5. The gauge
has erased most of the gains since European Central Bank
officials agreed on an unlimited bond-purchase program.  “An ugly session for equity markets has unfolded today as
sellers drove stocks lower on the back of some disappointing
corporate earnings,” said  Angus Campbell , head of market
analysis at Capital Spreads in  London .  “With a lack of macro-economic data releases, the focus
has been very much on companies and there were some car-crash
type profit warnings and well-below-expectation results which
sent investors into risk aversion mode.”  European stocks fell yesterday as investors speculated that
 Spain  will face less pressure to seek a bailout after a victory
in regional elections for Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy .  Moody’s Investors Service lowered its  credit rating  on
Catalonia and four other Spanish regions. The decision was
“driven by the deterioration in their liquidity positions, as
evidenced by their very limited cash reserves as of September
2012 and their significant reliance on short-term credit lines
to fund operating needs,” the ratings company said.  Spanish Economy  The Spanish economy contracted for a fifth quarter in the
three months through September. Gross domestic product shrank
0.4 percent from the previous three months, matching the
contraction of the second quarter, the Bank of Spain said in an
estimate in its monthly bulletin released in  Madrid  today. That
compares with a median forecast for a 0.7 percent contraction in
a Bloomberg News survey of 10 economists.  Spain sold 3.53 billion euros ($4.6 billion) of bills
today, exceeding its maximum goal.  Euro-area  consumer confidence  remained little changed in
October after decreasing in the previous four months. An index
of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area rose to minus
25.6 from minus 25.9 in September, the European Commission in
Brussels said in an initial estimate today. The September
reading was the lowest since May 2009. Economists had forecast
an unchanged reading, the median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey showed.  National Benchmarks  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European markets except Iceland. France’s CAC 40 Index sank 2.2
percent, Germany’s DAX lost 2.1 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100
Index slid 1.4 percent.  Alfa Laval (ALFA)  slipped 5.7 percent to 116.80 kronor. The
company reported third-quarter order intake of 7.29 billion
kronor ($1.1 billion), missing the estimates of Deutsche Bank AG
and UBS AG. Alpha Laval said it sees fourth-quarter demand in
line with or lower than that of the third quarter.  D.E Master Blenders, the coffee and tea company spun off by
Sara Lee Corp. in June, lost 5.3 percent to 9.28 euros after it
posted first-quarter revenue that missed analyst estimates as
price increases in Germany led consumers to reduce purchases.  Revenue fell 1.5 percent to 645 million euros in the three
months through September, the company said. Analysts had
expected sales of 664 million euros.  Mulberry Slides  Mulberry tumbled 24 percent to 1,006 pence. The British
luxury-handbag maker said in an unscheduled announcement that
profit will fall because of declining shipments to wholesale
customers. Pretax profit will rise to 41.8 million pounds ($66.9
million) in the fiscal year through March, analysts had
projected in a Bloomberg survey.  Burberry Plc (BRBY) , the largest U.K. luxury-goods maker, slid 3.2
percent to 1,134 pence.  Chemical makers sank 2.8 percent for the biggest decline
among the 19 industry  groups  in the Stoxx 600. DuPont, the most
valuable U.S. chemical manufacturer, posted a smaller third-
quarter profit than analysts estimated. Arkema SA, the French
maker of industrial chemicals, sank 5.1 percent to 69.06 euros,
while  BASF SE (BAS)  lost 4.1 percent to 62.50 euros.  Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY) , Europe’s third-largest aluminum maker,
retreated 5.2 percent to 25.48 kroner. The company posted a
third-quarter net loss of 277 million kroner ($49 million),
compared with a profit of 997 million kroner a year earlier.
That surpassed a loss estimate of 142 million kroner in a
Bloomberg survey. Sales declined to 19 billion kroner from 23.8
billion kroner.  Nokia Falls  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  fell 5.1 percent to 2.05 euros. The mobile-phone
maker trying to cope with falling sales and dwindling cash will
sell 750 million euros of convertible bonds to address
approaching debt maturities. The senior unsecured bonds due 2017
are convertible into Nokia shares, the company said.  Michelin & Cie (ML)  added 3.4 percent to 63.97 euros. The
world’s second-largest tiremaker said third-quarter revenue rose
5.7 percent to 5.44 billion euros, beating the 5.31 billion-euro
average of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Experian Plc (EXPN)  advanced 3.8 percent to 1,087 pence. The
credit-reference company said it has entered into a conditional
agreement to acquire a further 29.6 percent interest in
Brazilian credit bureau Serasa for $1.5 billion plus a cash
adjustment to the date of completion.  Stora Enso Oyj (STEAV)  jumped 4.8 percent to 4.91 euros. Europe’s
largest papermaker, which reported third-quarter profit that
missed analyst estimates, said it will close plants to improve
profitability.  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  jumped 7.7 percent to 640 pence. The
company, whose chip designs power Apple Inc.’s iPhone, said it
started the current quarter with a record order backlog after
third-quarter sales rose more than estimated by analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
