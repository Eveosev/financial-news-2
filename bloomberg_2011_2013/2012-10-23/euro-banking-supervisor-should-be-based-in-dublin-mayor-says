Dublin Mayor Naoise O’Muiri is
urging European leaders to establish the euro-area’s planned
banking supervisor in the home of the world’s biggest banking
crisis per capita since the Great Depression.  “Locating the Euro’s Bank regulator in Dublin would be a
symbolic and practical reward for the promises Ireland has
kept,” the city mayor told an audience in Berlin on Oct. 19,
according to a copy of a speech on his website. It “would gain
in authority from being positioned in the capital that knows
best the horrendous cost of lax financial regulation.”  O’Muiri, a member of Prime Minister Enda Kenny’s ruling
Fine Gael Party, said that Frankfurt should be out of the
running to hold the regulator as  Germany  doesn’t want the
supervisor to cover smaller German banks and landesbanken.
London also appears to be moving away from the European project,
he said.  The Irish state has pledged or injected 64 billion euros
($83 billion) into the financial system since its decade-old
property boom collapsed in 2008 and the country requested an
international bailout in 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
