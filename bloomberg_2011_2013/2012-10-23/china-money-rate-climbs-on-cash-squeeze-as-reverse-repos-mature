China ’s benchmark money-market rate
rose for a second day as maturing reverse-repurchase agreements
outweighed fund injections by the central bank, causing a cash
squeeze in the financial system.  About 400 billion  yuan  ($64 billion) of reverse repos are
due this week, draining funds from the system, according to
Weisheng He, a strategist at Citigroup Inc. The People’s Bank of
China sold 42 billion yuan of 28-day contracts at a yield of 3.6
percent today, according to a trader at a primary dealer
required to bid at the auctions. It also offered 49 billion yuan
of seven-day agreements at 3.35 percent, the trader said.  “On a net basis, about 100 billion yuan of reverse repos
are set to mature so that causes a bit of liquidity tightness in
the money market,” Citigroup’s He said by telephone from
 Shanghai .  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, rose 20 basis points, or
0.20 percentage point, to 2.92 percent in Shanghai, according to
a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center.  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost to receive the
seven-day repurchase rate, increased five basis points to 3.17
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on
3.39 percent government bonds due August 2022 climbed two basis
points to 3.54 percent, according to the National Interbank
Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
