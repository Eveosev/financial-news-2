Ukraineâ€™s barley exports will fall
18.7 percent in the year that began on July 1 after drought
damaged crops, agriculture researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Exports will decline to 2 million metric tons from 2.46
million metric tons a year earlier, the Kiev-based organization
said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
