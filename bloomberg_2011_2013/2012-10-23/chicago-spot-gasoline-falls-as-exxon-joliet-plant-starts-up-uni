Chicago spot gasoline weakened after
Exxon Mobilâ€™s refinery in Joliet,  Illinois  started a unit
yesterday.  Exxon reported a release of gasoline and heavier products
from a coker at the plant on Oct. 19. The refinery has a
capacity of 238,000 barrels a day.  The  price  for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, sank 3.5 cents to trade at a discount of 11
cents a gallon to futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
3:30 p.m.  Prompt delivery  dropped by 7.64 cents to $2.4961.  The  premium  for reformulated regular gasoline in New York
Harbor narrowed 1.88 cents to 2 cents a gallon over futures on
the Nymex at 3:30 p.m., the lowest level since July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
