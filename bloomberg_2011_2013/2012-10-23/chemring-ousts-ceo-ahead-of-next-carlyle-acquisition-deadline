Chemring Group Plc (CHG) , the target of a
takeover approach by Carlyle Group LLP, said Mark Papworth will
replace long-serving  David Price  as chief executive officer as
negotiations with the private equity firm come to a head.  Papworth will take over running the maker of munitions and
aircraft protection-equipment on Nov. 5, Chemring said in a
statement. Four days later is a deadline for takeover talks with
Carlyle.  Chemring on Aug. 17 said it had received a preliminary
approach from Carlyle. Takeover discussions have been extended
twice, during which time Chemring has cut its outlook for
profit. David Price stood down “with immediate effect,” the
company said.  Papworth oversaw an overhaul of Wood Group Plc, and has
held an executive position at the energy unit of Rolls-Royce
Holding Plc.  Chemring shares declined 2.1 percent to 339.2 pence at the
open of trading in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
