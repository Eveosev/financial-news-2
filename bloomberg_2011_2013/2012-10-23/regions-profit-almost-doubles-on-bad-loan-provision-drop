Regions Financial Corp. (RF) , the 10th-
largest U.S. bank by deposits, said third-quarter profit almost
doubled, matching analysts’ estimates as provisions for loan
losses declined.  Net income rose to $301 million, or 21 cents a share, from
$155 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier, the Birmingham,
Alabama-based bank said today in a statement. That matched the
 average estimate  of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Regions, led by Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall, 55,
has been profitable every quarter except one since the end of
2010. The bank has cut its bad-loan provision for eight
consecutive quarters and the shares surged 65 percent this year,
the  second-best performer  in the 24-company  KBW Bank Index (BKX) 
behind Charlotte, North Carolina-based  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)   Regions set aside $33 million for bad loans during the
third quarter, compared with $355 million in the same period
last year.  Regions is considering a preferred stock offering in “the
near future” if market conditions are favorable, according to a
separate statement today. The proceeds would be used for general
corporate purposes, which may include the redemption of certain
trust-preferred securities, Regions said.  Total revenue declined 1 percent to $1.35 billion in the
third quarter as net interest income fell to $817 million from
$850 million. Non-interest income rose 3.9 percent to $533
million as mortgage income climbed to a record $106 million from
$68 million last year.  Low Rates  Historically low  interest rates  and government incentive
programs are fueling demand for home loans.  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) , the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported a third-quarter
profit increase this month that included a 72 percent surge in
mortgage revenue. CEO  Jamie Dimon  said at the time that the
housing market has “turned the corner.”  Bank of America Chief Financial Officer  Bruce Thompson  said
this month that housing prices are “no question” moving in the
right direction.  Net charge-offs at Regions declined 49 percent to $262
million. Total loans fell 5.3 percent to $75.3 billion. That was
driven by a 12 percent drop in consumer credit-card loans to
$901 million and a 27 percent decrease in investor real estate
loans to $8.71 billion.  Regions’s net interest margin widened to 3.08 percent from
3.04 percent in the same period last year and narrowed from 3.16
percent in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
