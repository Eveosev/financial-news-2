Some ship operators hiring private
armed guards to protect their vessels from hijack by Somali
pirates aren’t reporting attempted attacks, the London-based
International Maritime Bureau’s piracy reporting center said.  Following are comments from Pottengal Mukundan, the
bureau’s director, at the Hanson Wade Combating Piracy
conference in London today:  “Vessels with private armed security are not reporting the
attempted attacks that other vessels were reporting before.
There could be many reasons for this, it could be that they fear
liability or simply the owners themselves have got clauses in
their contracts which prevent any reporting of attempted
attacks. This is very sad.  ‘‘If there is an attempted attack, that information about
that pirate skiff is vital to the next vessel coming down that
area.  ‘‘Until recently there were a lot more free reports coming
out and at the moment we feel that the reports are being
suppressed. We need to find a way if people are afraid of
liability or other such factors, for that information to be made
available.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
