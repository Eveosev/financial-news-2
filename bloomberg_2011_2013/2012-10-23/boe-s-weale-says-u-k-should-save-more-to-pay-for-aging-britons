Bank of England policy maker Martin Weale said the U.K. needs to save more to pay for the
potentially higher costs of social and welfare services as
Britain’s population grows older.  Britain has been “one of the lowest saving of the advanced
economies” in the past 25 years, Weale told lawmakers at a
parliamentary hearing in  London  today. “Essentially it’s
because we’ve been a very low-saving economy that we now have
worries about pensions, we have worries about all sorts of
things.”  Weale said his comments weren’t related to the current U.K.
economic situation, “but in the medium term the economy does
have to be saving more.” He part of this should involve the
public sector “thinking about what cost pressures and
expenditure pressures might be in the future.”  “It seems to me quite a strong case to say that a prudent
public sector would run its affairs to allow for the risk of
increased pressures coming later on,” he said. “It would be
likely, at least some extent, to save up in advance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
