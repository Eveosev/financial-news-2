The ruble fell the most in a month
as oil declined for a fourth day and amid expectations that OAO
Rosneft’s purchase of TNK-BP will boost demand for dollars.  The ruble depreciated 1.2 percent to 31.4435 against the
dollar at 7 p.m. in Moscow, the most since Sept. 26 on a closing
basis. The currency fell 0.4 percent versus the euro at 40.7500.
It was down 0.8 percent against the central bank’s euro-dollar
target basket at 35.6314.  Crude,  Russia ’s chief export earner, slumped 2.6 percent to
$86.30 a barrel in  New York , heading for the lowest close in
three month. Rosneft agreed to buy  BP Plc (BP/) ’s half of the TNK-BP
oil venture for $26.8 billion in cash and shares and has a
preliminary accord to acquire the other half from its
billionaire partners for $28 billion in cash.  The ruble was affected by the sharp oil decline and
uncertainty about “the scale of the effect the deal might have
on the  spot market ,” Dmitry Polevoy, a Moscow-based economist
at ING Groep NV, said by e-mail. “It forced some players to
start cutting earlier long-ruble positions.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.9235 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.5390 yesterday.  “The fear on the part of some investors” that some
ongoing acquisitions may have foreign-exchange market
implications is driving ruble weakness,  Societe Generale  SA said
in an e-mailed note today said. “Our view is that these fears
are largely overdone.”  Societe Generale recommended buying the currency against
the basket, with a target of 33.60 .  The extra yield that investors demand to own Russia’s
dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose seven basis points 180,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields added 11 basis points to
7.1116 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
