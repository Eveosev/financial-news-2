Romania ’s Finance Ministry will
refinance in two steps a 794 million-euro ($1 billion) debt due
on Nov. 10, Deputy Minister Enache Jiru said, according to
 Ziarul Financiar .  The ministry, which raised 421.5 million euros in four-year
euro-denominated bonds on the local market yesterday, is making
efforts to boost its foreign exchange reserves to resist in a
difficult market for leu-denominated treasuries, Jiru told the
Bucharest-based newspaper.  Romania’s funding buffer, agreed with the International
Monetary Fund, is of about 4.6 billion euros, Jiru said, adding
that the ministry plans to limit debt issues with maturities
below two years, Ziarul Financiar reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
