New York  City filed a lawsuit
against Smart Apartments, alleging it has been booking,
accepting and advertising short-term reservations in illegally
converted and unsafe apartments in residential buildings.  In May 2011, a state bill went into effect that clarified
ambiguities in the law and codified transient occupancy as being
less than 30 days. Illegal hotels unlawfully convert residential
units intended for permanent occupancy for short-term stays of
fewer than 30 days, Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  said in a statement.  Smart Apartments has been operating illegal short-term
tourist accommodations in nearly 50 residential buildings in
Manhattan and Brooklyn, Bloomberg said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
