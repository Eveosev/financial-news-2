California sold $539.3 million of
general-obligation bonds today in its largest tax-exempt
competitive issue since 2007.  The winning bidder,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , offered a yield
of 2.14 percent on a 10-year maturity,  Tom Dresslar , a spokesman
for Treasurer Bill Lockyer, said in a statement. The deal,
replacing previous debt, will lower interest payments for the
most populous state by about $118 million, he said.  The 10-year rate is  0.44 percentage point  more than a
benchmark index of munis, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
so-called yield spread shrank from 0.68 percentage point when
the state issued 10-year bonds on Sept. 24 in a negotiated deal,
and is the  slimmest  for the state’s bonds in four years, the
data show.  “We’re pleased with the results,” Dresslar said in an e-
mailed response to a question about the state’s strategy. “We
always make decisions on whether to go competitive or negotiated
based on what works best for taxpayers.  That will continue to
be our practice.”  The yields are 1.07 percent for the five-year maturity and
about 3.53 percent for a 20-year maturity, Dresslar said.  2007 Sale  Today’s sale was  California ’s largest competitive general-
obligation issue since February 2007, when it offered $1.1
billion in tax exempts and $625 million in taxable bonds.  JPMorgan submitted the winning bid at a true interest cost
of 3.22 percent for a 20-year security, Dresslar said. The true
interest cost represents the total cash amount of the interest
payments and the time of the interest and principal payments.  The losing bids were Wells Fargo Bank National Association,
3.24 percent;  Morgan Stanley & Co. (MS) , 3.280 percent;  Bank of
America Merrill Lynch , 3.285 percent;  Goldman Sachs & Co. (GS) , 3.31
percent;  Barclays Capital Inc. (BARC) , 3.34 percent; RBC Capital
Markets LLC, 3.36 percent, and  Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (C) ,
3.39 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
