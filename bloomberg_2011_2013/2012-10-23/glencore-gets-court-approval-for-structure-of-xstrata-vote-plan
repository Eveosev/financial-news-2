A U.K. court approved share
reclassification and voting plans for  Glencore International
Plc’s (GLEN)  proposed takeover of  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , including a provision
that allows shareholders to go ahead with the merger without a
management compensation plan.  Registrar Clive Jones in London today signed off on the
scheme of arrangement for the exchange of shares and a
shareholder vote to be held by Xstrata in  Switzerland . The
takeover is still subject to a shareholder approval and further
legal clearance from a U.K. court.  Xstrata is the target of a $32.5 billion bid by Glencore,
the year’s largest takeover. The merger, five years in the
making, would couple Glencore’s trading operations with
Xstrata’s coal, copper and zinc mines, creating a group with
130,000 employees in more than 40 nations.  The purpose of the hearing in  London  today was to get
initial approval for the terms of the deal, a “sanity check,”
said Xstrata lawyer Andrew Thornton.  Xstrata shareholders will be given four voting options: to
reject or approve the deal, to approve it only with a management
compensation plan to retain key executives, or to approve it
only without the compensation plan, Thornton said.  The takeover can proceed without specific approval of the
“management incentive arrangement,” he said.  Xstrata, based in Zug, Switzerland, recommended on Oct. 1
that shareholders vote in favor of a sweetened Glencore offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
