The  London Olympics  will come in 377
million pounds ($603 million) under budget after lower than
anticipated transport, security and infrastructure costs, the
U.K. government said.  The  London  Olympic and Paralympic Games probably cost 8.921
billion pounds, the U.K. Department for Culture, Media and Sport
said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s below the 9.3
billion pounds estimated in 2007, when the government was forced
to triple the original spending plan after underestimating the
expense of cleaning up the Olympic Park site and building sports
venues.  London had won the right to host the capital city’s third
games in 2005. The 2008 Beijing Olympics cost $67 billion.  “London 2012 was a tremendous success and it is a
significant achievement to deliver this large and complex
program on time and under budget,” Minister for Sport Hugh Robertson said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
