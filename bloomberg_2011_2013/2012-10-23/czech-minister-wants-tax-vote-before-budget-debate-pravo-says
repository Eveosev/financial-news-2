Czech Finance Minister Miroslav
Kalousek wants lawmakers to start debating 2013 draft state
budget only after the parliament votes on a bill that includes
tax increases,  Pravo  reported, citing him.  Premier Petr Necas is struggling to overcome a revolt in
his  Civic Democratic Party  as a group of its lawmakers opposes
the governmentâ€™s proposal to raise the sales-tax rates and
introduce a new tax rate for the highest earners, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
