Faurecia (EO) ,  Europe ’s largest maker of
car interiors, cut its 2012 earnings outlook, saying it expects
a sharp sales decline in Europe in the fourth quarter as a
result of an amplification in slowing automobile production.  Faurecia said third-quarter revenues rose 7.9 percent
bolstered by higher demand from from markets outside Europe and
by the acquisition of the  Ford Motor Co. (F)  plant in Saline,
 Michigan .  Sales advanced to 4.09 billion euros ($5.34 billion) from
3.79 billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said
in a statement e-mailed today. Faurecia now expects 2012
operating income “above 500 million euros” for 2012, compared
with earnings of 560 million euros to 610 million euros as
forecast in July.  “Despite the increased contribution of other regions and
already significant cost adjustments, lower sales in Europe will
affect the Group’s profitability in the fourth quarter,” the
company said in a statement.  Faurecia, which is 57 percent-owned by French troubled
carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen, seeks to expand its activities
outside Europe as the continent’s car market is heading for
fifth straight annual decline, with Peugeot,  Fiat SpA (F)  and
 Renault SA (RNO)  leading the drop.  Moody’s Investors Service cut its outlook on Faurecia was
cut to stable from positive on July 27. The ratings company
views the auto supplier’s relationship with majority sharholder
Peugeot primarly as an operating challenge, but believes that it
can largely compensate shorfalls of sales to Peugeot by business
from other carmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
