The cost to extend a project that
brings water to  South Africa ’s industrial hub from Lesotho has
risen about 15 percent to 9 billion rand ($1.02 billion) from a
December 2010 estimate, a South African official said.  The cost increase from about 7.8 billion rand comes after
the South African and Lesotho governments approved the second
phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project last year. The
extension includes construction of the 163.5-meter-high (536-
foot) Polihali dam and a 38.2-kilometer (24-mile) tunnel linking
it to Katse Dam.  “We are hoping that by November 2020 the water will be
flowing into South Africa” from the new dam, Zodwa Dlamini,
South Africa’s chief delegate to the Lesotho Highlands Water
Commission, which oversees the project, told lawmakers in  Cape
Town  today.  Lesotho, a landlocked mountainous kingdom of 2 million
people south of Johannesburg, has sold about 10 billion cubic
meters of water to South Africa for 4.24 billion rand in royalty
payments.  The water is fed into the Vaal River system that supplies
South Africa’s Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg,
the country’s largest city, and the capital  Pretoria .  A project management unit is being established that will
help select companies to design and build the new dam and
tunnels, Dlamini said.  Project managers are also considering the viability of a
1,200-megawatt hydropower project that will entail building a
101-meter-high dam at Kobong and linking it to the Katse dam by
a 6.3-kilometer tunnel, with electricity generated via a pump-
storage facility.  Lesotho ’s government will pay for the power project if it
goes ahead, Dlamini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
