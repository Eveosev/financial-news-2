The Bundesbank disagrees with
 Germany ’s Audit Court that the central bank should take stock of
its gold holdings outside Germany.  “The Bundesbank and the Federal Court of Auditors have
different opinions” on the matter, the Frankfurt-based
Bundesbank said in a statement posted on its website today. The
foreign central banks that hold gold on the Bundesbank’s behalf
verify the holdings annually and “there are no doubts about the
integrity, reputation and safety of these foreign
depositories,” it said.  The Bundesbank manages Germany’s gold reserves, which
amounted to 3,396 tons as of Dec. 21, 2011. The gold hoard is
kept at central bank vaults in Frankfurt,  New York , Paris and
 London . The Federal Court of Auditors yesterday called on the
Bundesbank to physically take stock of its gold holdings outside
Germany because “they’ve never been assessed.”  The court said the Bundesbank has started to act on its
recommendation to negotiate with the three foreign central banks
for the right to physically verify the stocks. Germany’s central
bank has agreed to transfer 150 tons of its gold from the U.S.
to Germany over the next three years, where it will undergo
“thorough examination,” the court said.  “Despite our different view of the law, the Bundesbank
will, where possible, take up the audit court’s suggestions,”
the Bundesbank said today.  The Audit Court can only give recommendations and can't
legally force the Bundesbank to act, a spokesman for the 
Bonn-based court said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
