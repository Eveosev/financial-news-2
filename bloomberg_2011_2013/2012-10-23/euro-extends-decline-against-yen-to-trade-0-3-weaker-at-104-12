The dollar and the yen gained versus
most major counterparts as companies reported financial results
that missed analyst estimates, adding to evidence the global
economy is slowing and sapping risk appetite.  Higher-yielding currencies including the  New Zealand dollar 
weakened as global stocks and commodities dropped.  Canada ’s
dollar rose versus most peers as the central bank signaled it
may raise interest rates, while  Brazil ’s real fell versus the
dollar as its central bank intervened. The euro slid from a
five-month high versus the yen after French  industrial
confidence  dropped to the lowest level since 2009.  “In the U.S., earnings have been disappointing, especially
in sectors which have been the brighter spots, like
technology,”  Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at
Barclays Plc in New York, said in an interview. “In periods of
uncertainty, safe-haven currencies win out, with the usual
suspects, the yen and the dollar, seeing some buying.”  The dollar advanced 0.6 percent to $1.2987 per euro at 5
p.m. New York time. It touched $1.2952, the strongest level in a
week. The yen gained 0.7 percent to 103.69 to the 17-nation
currency after depreciating earlier to 104.59, its weakest level
since May 4. The Japanese currency appreciated 0.1 percent to
79.85 per dollar after slipping earlier to 80.01, the weakest
since July 6.  Manufacturing Gauge  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  rose 0.3 percent to 79.911 as the Federal
Reserve Bank of Richmond’s manufacturing index for October
expectedly fell. The reading was negative 7, versus a forecast
of 5 in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Intercontinental
Exchange Inc. uses the  Dollar Index  to track the greenback
against the currencies of six major U.S. trade partners.  The yen typically strengthens in times of financial and
economic turmoil because  Japan ’s historical trade surplus means
the nation doesn’t have to rely on overseas lenders. The dollar
benefits as a haven as the world’s main reserve currency.  “The market does not like uncertainty -- you want to know
what you’re dealing with and not be guessing your way along,”
said  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S. currency sales at  Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. (8411)  in New York. “The market has enjoyed a
little bit of risk-on, and that’s changing.”  The euro rose 1.3 percent over the past month against nine
developed-nation counterparts tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. Norway’s krone gained 1.2 percent, while the
yen dropped 2 percent.  Krone, Kiwi  The krone dropped 1 percent today to 5.7276 to the dollar
as investors sought refuge. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the
kiwi, declined 0.8 percent to 81.16 U.S. cents and reached 81.01
cents, the lowest since Sept. 11.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1.4 percent, and the
MSCI World Index dropped 1.6 percent. Of the 145 S&P 500 Index
members to have reported financial results, 60 percent missed
analysts’ revenue estimates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. reported worse-than-
forecast financial results last week.  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials sank 1.4 percent.  “We need to be cautious; central banks around the world
are actively implementing monetary stimulus,”  Derek Halpenny ,
the European head of global-markets research at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London , said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Lunch Money” with Sara Eisen. “In that sense, I
wouldn’t be positioning for any kind of major risk-off.”  Brazil’s Real  The Brazilian currency declined from the two-week high it
reached yesterday against the greenback after the central bank
auctioned reverse currency swaps to support exporters by
preventing appreciation. The real weakened 0.2 percent to 2.0272
per  U.S. dollar  after gaining to 2.0237 yesterday. The central
bank said today it auctioned 33,000 reverse currency swaps
contracts out of 60,000 offered.  Canada’s dollar erased an earlier loss against the euro and
appreciated 0.5 percent to C$1.2888. It was little changed at
99.24 cents to the greenback after sliding earlier to 99.76
cents, the weakest level since Aug. 8.  The  Bank of Canada  strengthened its bias for raising
 interest rates , retaining its outlier status among the Group of
Seven nations. It signaled it may seek to curb record household
debt levels by boosting rates for the first time in more than
two years. The bank held its  benchmark rate  at 1 percent, as
forecast by all 26 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  South Africa ’s rand tumbled against all of its 16 most-
traded counterparts as copper dropped to its lowest level in
more than six weeks. Metals and other commodities account for 45
percent of the nation’s exports. The rand slid to the lowest in
a week versus the dollar, losing as much as 2 percent to 8.8102.  The euro fell earlier as an index of sentiment among French
factory executives dropped to 85 in October, the lowest since
August 2009, from 90 last month, the statistics office Insee
said in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
