Apple Inc. (AAPL)  introduced upgrades
across its computer product line, adding a redesigned iMac
desktop with a thinner profile, a more powerful Mac mini and a
13-inch notebook that boasts a high definition display.  The iMac, which integrates the display and components into
a single unit, now is 5 millimeters thick at the edges, and
includes more power computing and expanded data storage options.  The 21.5-inch iMac will sell from $1,299 and the 27-inch
from $1,799, from November.  Cupertino, California-based Apple also unveiled a 13-inch
MacBook Pro with a high-definition display and thinner profile.  Apple, which had introduced a 15-inch laptop earlier this
year with high-definition screen, unveiled the new product at an
event in  San Jose , California. The 13-inch version will start at
$1,699.  Appleâ€™s Mac mini line of computers, which come without a
display, were also refreshed with upgrades to the processor and
storage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
