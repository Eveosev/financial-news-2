Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) , the biggest
U.S. motorcycle maker, surged the most in 15 months after
touting new models headed to dealerships by 2015.  The  shares  rose 6.3 percent to $46.26 at 11:24 a.m. in  New
York , after reaching $47.10 for the biggest intraday gain since
July 2011. The Milwaukee-based company’s stock gained 12 percent
this year through yesterday.  New bikes coming by 2015 will benefit from the company’s
focus on the flagship Harley brand, Chief Executive Officer
Keith Wandell said today. Product development had been hurt by
lower revenue and other brands it owned. Wandell, who became CEO
in 2009, sold the Buell and MV Agusta brands. Harley-Davidson
has also cut its new-product development time to three years
from five or six, he said.  “This is one of our biggest frustrations in the company:
We’d like to have those products here today,” Wandell said on a
conference call with analysts and investors. “All I can tell
you is I think we are poised here. We’re more excited today
about the array of products under development that we’re
bringing to market, than maybe we’ve ever been in the history of
our company.”  Net income  for the maker of Super Glide and Night Rod
motorcycles fell 27 percent to $134 million, or 59 cents a
share, compared with $183.6 million, or 79 cents, a year
earlier. Harley curbed production at its York, Pennsylvania,
factory, its largest, to install a new production and planning
software system. The average  estimate  of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for profit of 58 cents a share.  Labor Contracts  Revenue excluding financial services fell 12 percent to
$1.09 billion from the third quarter of 2011. Total sales
declined 11 percent to $1.25 billion. The company gets about a
third of its revenue from motorcycles and related products
outside the U.S.  Harley has benefited from reduced costs through
renegotiating labor contracts at factories in Pennsylvania and
 Wisconsin . Harley is “largely finished” revamping its
production system, which gives it more flexibility, Wandell said
today.  “The results are more products for all out our customers
that have new and exciting innovation attached,” Wandell said
in an interview.  Bikes such as the $7,999 Super Low, less pricey and easier
to handle, are winning new riders, a group whose growth has
outpaced increasing sales to traditional customers this year,
Harley said today. The company hired Wandell from  Johnson
Controls Inc. (JCI) , where he was the No. 2 executive, to revive
operations.  Third-quarter  gross margin  widened to 34.7 percent of sales
from 33.7 percent. Operating margin from motorcycles and related
products fell to 13.3 percent from 14.7 percent. Harley today
reaffirmed its forecast for annual gross margin of 34.75 percent
and 35.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
