Coal is stockpiled in preparation for loading onto ships for export, at the Newcastle Coal Terminal in Newcastle, Australia.  Coal fuels about 40 percent of electricity generation worldwide and is responsible for about the same percentage of global carbon dioxide emissions from energy. U.S. coal exports are on track to break their annual record of 113 billion tons, set in 1981, according to the U.S.  Energy Information Administration .  Visit  www.bloomberg.com/sustainability  for the latest from Bloomberg News about energy, natural resources and global business.
