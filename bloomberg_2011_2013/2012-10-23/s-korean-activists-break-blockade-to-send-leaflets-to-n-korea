South Korean activists eluded police
and floated balloons across the northern border to drop leaflets
criticizing Kim Jong Un’s communist regime.  Defying warnings that  North Korea ’s military may fire on
them, about 10 people launched balloons carrying 120,000
leaflets from a border island off the west coast, activists from
Free North Korea Radio, a Seoul-based group which broadcasts
outside news to the North, said in a statement on its website.
They broke off from an original group of 80 who were blocked by
South Korean police earlier in the day at their favored launch
site at Imjingak, an outpost on the edge of the demilitarized
zone.  North Korea on Oct. 19 threatened “direct firing” at the
balloon launch site, the first such warning against activists
since Kim Jong Un succeeded his father as dictator in December.
Under the late  Kim Jong Il , threats were routinely made against
the distribution of leaflets, without action being taken. Five
episodes earlier this year drew no response from North Korea.  The government in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang
characterizes the leaflet drops as psychological warfare and an
attempt to topple its communist regime -- provocations which it
has said could ignite a war.  South Korean activists and North Koreans who have defected
to the South have sent such leaflets for years, sometimes
including gifts such as U.S. dollar bills and candy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
