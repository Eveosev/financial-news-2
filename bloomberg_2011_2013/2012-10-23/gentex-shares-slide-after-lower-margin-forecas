Gentex Corp. (GNTX)  declined after the
maker of advanced-technology automotive rearview mirrors
forecast that gross profit margin this quarter will trail the
third-quarter result.  The  shares  dropped 0.4 percent to $17.17 at the close in
 New York , after falling as much as 12 percent for the biggest
intraday slide since July 24. They are down 42 percent this
year.  Fourth-quarter revenue will be about the same as a year
earlier, when it had net sales of $260.3 million, according to a
statement today by the Zeeland, Michigan-based company. Gross
profit margin for the period “will be down slightly” from the
third quarter’s 33.6 percent, Gentex said.  The company said on July 24 that four customers had decided
to put rear-camera displays with the radio in the center console
of a vehicle, rather than in the mirror. Those decisions will
hurt 2013 and 2014 results, Gentex said at the time. No other
customers have made such a move, according to today’s statement.  The automotive supplier said its board authorized buying
back as many as 4 million additional shares.  Gentex reported third-quarter  net income  of $41.9 million,
or 29 cents a share, down from $43.4 million, or 30 cents, a
year earlier. The average of 11 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was for 28 cents a share. Revenue declined less than
1 percent to $268.2 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
