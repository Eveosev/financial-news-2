Tropical Storm Sandy strengthened as
it moved toward  Jamaica , where forecasters predict it may arrive
as a hurricane tomorrow.  Sandy’s top winds rose to 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour
earlier today, and the system was churning through the Caribbean
about 225 miles south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said in an 8 p.m.  advisory . Hurricane
warnings were posted on the island.  “Given the environment of low shear and high oceanic heat
content, Sandy is likely to strengthen into a hurricane in 12 to
24 hours,” Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist at the
Miami center, wrote in a forecast analysis.  After Sandy strikes Jamaica, the storm is expected to cross
eastern Cuba and reach the Bahamas by the weekend. Most
forecasting models say it won’t make a direct hit on the U.S.,
although some suggest it may bring rain, and possibly snow, to
parts of the Northeast.  “Yesterday, one of the computer forecast models had 4 feet
of snow across the western part of  Pennsylvania , today it has
3,” said  Tom Kines , a meteorologist at  AccuWeather Inc.  in
 State College , Pennsylvania. “That is the extreme, probably not
likely, but you can’t disregard it.”  Kines said Sandy’s impact on the U.S., if any, won’t be
felt until next week.  In the Caribbean, Sandy is expected to reach eastern Cuba
in about two days, Kines said.  Island Alerts  Cuba issued a hurricane warning for its eastern provinces,
including Guantanamo, and  Haiti  is under a tropical storm
warning. The Bahamas posted a storm watch for the central and
southeastern part of the island chain, including the Acklins and
Rum Cay, the center said.  A warning means storm conditions may develop in the next
day. A watch means there is a possibility of a strike in the
next two days.  As the storm grows in size and moves farther north, a
tropical storm watch may be needed for southeastern  Florida  and
the Keys, according to the center.  On Jamaica, about 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain may
fall, which may cause flash-flooding and landslides, according
to the  Meteorological Service of Jamaica .  Active Season  Sandy is the 18th named storm in the Atlantic this year,
tying with 1969 as the fourth-most active season on record. A
19th storm will probably develop from a tropical depression 990
miles northeast of the Leeward Islands that has 35 mph winds.
It’s not forecast to reach the U.S.  If that system develops into Tropical Storm Tony, 2012 will
be the third year in a row that 19 storms have formed in the
Atlantic and will become the third-most active season. In
addition to 2010 and 2011, 1995 and 1887 also produced 19 storms,
according to  Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor ,  Michigan .  The most active year was 2005, when 28 storms formed,
including  Hurricane Katrina  that devastated  New Orleans .  To contact the reporter on this story:
