Cielo SA (CIEL3) , Brazil’s biggest payments
processor, posted a third-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates as credit- and debit-card volume increased.  Net income advanced 29 percent to 588.9 million reais
($290.5 million) from 457.6 million reais a year earlier, the
Barueri, Brazil-based company said today in a regulatory filing.
Profit excluding some items was 590.7 million reais, exceeding
the average estimate of 584 million reais by 12 analysts in a
Bloomberg  survey .  Credit- and debit-card volume climbed 20 percent to 95.7
billion reais from a year earlier, Cielo said in the statement.
Operating expenses were 194.5 million reais, a 22 percent
increase from a year earlier.  Cielo fell 4.8 percent to 44.85 reais today, adding to
yesterday’s 4.9 percent drop, after O Estado de S. Paulo
reported that Brazil President  Dilma Rousseff  is seeking to
reduce card-transaction fees. Redecard SA, the nation’s second-
biggest bank-card processor, stopped trading in  Sao Paulo  on
Oct. 17 after it was acquired by  Itau Unibanco Holding SA. (ITUB4)   To contact the reporter on this story:
