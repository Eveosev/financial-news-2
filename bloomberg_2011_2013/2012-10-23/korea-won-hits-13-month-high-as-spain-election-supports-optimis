South Korea’s won rose to a 13-month
high as the outcome of regional elections in  Spain  boosted
optimism  Europe  will be able to contain its debt crisis,
supporting demand for emerging-market assets.  The euro rose for the first time in three days yesterday as
Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s  People’s Party  won 41 of
the 75 seats in the regional assembly in Galicia, clearing one
obstacle in the way of a bailout for Spain. The yen weakened
past 80 against the dollar for the first time in three months
today on speculation the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will add more stimulus
after data yesterday showed the nation’s exports slid 10.3
percent in September.  “The euro gaining after Spain’s regional elections, and
the weakening of the yen, a typical safe asset, are supporting
Asian currencies today including the won,” said Han Sung Min, a
Seoul-based currency trader for Busan Bank.  The won rose 0.1 percent to 1,102.97 per dollar at the
close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 1,100.03 earlier, the strongest level since
Sept. 16, 2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, slid 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 5.76 percent.  The won pared its advance as some investors cut short
positions on the dollar on speculation local policy makers will
seek to slow exchange-rate appreciation, according to Namkoong Taehun, a currency trader at Hana Bank. A short position is a
bet an asset will decline in value.  Government bonds  rose before an Oct. 26 report forecast to
show South Korea’s  economy  grew 1.7 percent in the third quarter
from a year earlier, the slowest pace in three years.  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent bonds due
September 2017 declined two basis points to 2.90 percent in
Seoul, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The one-year interest-
rate swap dropped two basis points to 2.80 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
