New Zealand  plans to sell at least
NZ$1 billion ($817 million) in inflation-linked debt by
syndication.  The 2 percent September 2025 security is expected to be
priced “in the near future, subject to market conditions,”
sale manager UBS AG said in an e-mailed statement. The
transaction will also be lead managed by Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. and Deutsche Bank AG, the Zurich-based bank
said.  “This is the first time we’ve used syndication for an
inflation-indexed transaction in New Zealand dollars,” Brendon Doyle, head of the New Zealand Debt Management Office, said in a
phone interview. “It’s good to have a variety of different
securities that we can offer investors to try and maximize
demand for New Zealand dollar assets.”  The Wellington-based NZDMO said at the time of the 2012
budget that it intends to issue as much as NZ$2 billion of
inflation-indexed bonds in each of the 2012-13 and 2013-14
fiscal years, according to a  statement  last month on its
website. Any issuance of inflation-linked debt in the current
fiscal year would be part of the NZ$13.5 billion domestic bond
program, the funding arm said in the statement.  The yield on New Zealand’s 10-year debt was at 3.6 percent
as of 5 p.m. in Wellington after earlier touching 3.61 percent,
the highest since Sept. 24. The nation’s sovereign notes have
handed investors a 4.5 percent return this year, while debt tied
to consumer-price gains advanced 0.4 percent, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
