Malaysian billionaire T. Ananda Krishnan’s Astro group won a  Singapore  court ruling upholding a
$250 million arbitration award against Lippo Group, its former
Indonesian partner.  A three-member arbitration tribunal in 2010 ruled against
Lippo for a failed television venture. Toby Landau, Lippo’s
lawyer, argued a time limit to oppose the arbitration award
didn’t apply in the case and that the company hadn’t agreed to
arbitration.  Once the time limit has passed, the tribunal’s decision is
taken as accepted by the parties and there is no possibility of
further recourse, Singapore High Court Justice Belinda Ang wrote
in an 85-page ruling today.  Astro started the Singapore arbitration a month after Lippo
sued companies and individuals linked to Krishnan in  Indonesia 
in September 2008 seeking the return of its investment in the
pay-TV venture. To enforce the awards, Astro sought orders from
courts including in the U.K.,  Hong Kong ,  Malaysia  and Singapore.  Krishnan’s Astro All Asia Networks Plc had said it ended
the venture after its Lippo partners failed to pay 805 million
ringgit ($264 million) in bills.  The Singapore cases are Astro Nusantara International BV v
PT Ayunda Prima Mitra OS807/2010 and OS913/2010. Singapore High
Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
