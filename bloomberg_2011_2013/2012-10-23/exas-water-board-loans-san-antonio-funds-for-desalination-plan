The Texas Water Development Board is
loaning the San Antonio Water System $50 million to help defray
costs for a desalination plant project to turn salty water from
the Wilcox aquifer into drinking water for consumers.  The brackish water project has an estimated price tag of
$229 million, with water to begin being generated at the reverse
osmosis plant in 2016 and full production by 2026. The San
Antonio area relies mostly on the Edwards aquifer for its
drinking water. Wilcox aquifer waters arenâ€™t subject to pumping
restrictions during the drought, the SAWS said.  The loan is the third low-interest one approved for the
project, with previous ones from the Texas water board amounting
to $59 million for planning, design and well-drilling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
