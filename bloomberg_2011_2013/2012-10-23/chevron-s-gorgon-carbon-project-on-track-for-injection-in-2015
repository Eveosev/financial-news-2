The  carbon capture  project linked to
 Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Gorgon liquefied natural gas project off the
northwest coast of Australia is on track to begin injections in
2015, Australian energy minister  Martin Ferguson  said.  The world’s largest carbon capture and sequestration
project is designed to inject 3.5 million tons of carbon dioxide
per year at a depth of about 2,300 meters below Barrow Island
off Western Australia.  “Carbon capture and storage remains the only viable method
of using fossil fuels, which are still favored for energy
security and affordability, while reducing global emissions in
the long run,” Ferguson said in the text of a speech delivered
in Perth today.  Australia is targeting a reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions of at least five percent below 2000 levels by 2020
with a longterm goal of cutting emissions by 80 percent below
2000 levels by 2050.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
