Chinese buyers curbed spending on
new properties in Hong Kong in the third quarter, according to
Centaline Property Agency Ltd.  Mainland buyers accounted for 31.2 percent of the money
spent in Hong Kong’s “first-hand” property market during the
quarter, a 19.8 percentage point decline from a year ago,
Centaline said in an e-mailed statement today. They made up 23.1
percent of total transactions, down 18.9 percentage points from
a year ago.  Home prices  in Hong Kong have surged more than 90 percent
since early 2009 on a shortage of new supply and an influx of
buyers from  China . Record low mortgage rates have also attracted
more investments by local buyers in the city’s property markets,
Centaline said.  Chinese buyers may also invest less in the fourth quarter
as middle-to-small-sized apartments, traditionally favored by
local Hong Kong buyers, hit the market, according to Centaline.  Mainland buyers accounted for 8.6 percent of total
transactions in Hong Kong’s second-hand property market in the
third quarter, down 1.5 percentage points from a year ago,
according to Centaline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
