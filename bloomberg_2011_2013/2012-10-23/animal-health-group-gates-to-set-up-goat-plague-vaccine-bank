The World Organisation for  Animal
Health  and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation plan to set up a
vaccine bank to fight a deadly viral disease of goats and sheep
known as peste des petits ruminants, or small ruminants plague.  The Paris-based animal-health group, known as OIE, will
write out a public tender by the end of this month for suppliers
to establish an operational vaccine bank in Africa, spokeswoman
Glaieul Mamaghani said by phone today. The Gates Foundation will
provide funding, she said.  The disease, also known as goat plague, is considered the
most destructive virus to sheep and goats and can cause death
rates of as much as 100 percent, according to the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization.  “PPR is one of the most economically important animal
diseases and severely impacts the lives and livelihoods of the
world’s poorest,” OIE Director General Bernard Vallat was cited
as saying in an e-mailed statement. “We are hopeful that this
first initiative marks the beginning of a regional and global
control strategy for the disease.”  The OIE said it will develop a pilot strategy for control
and longer-term eradication of the disease in two to three
African countries.  Ghana ,  Burkina Faso , Mali and  Nigeria  are
priorities for the project, Mamaghani said.  The proposed vaccine bank will have “virtual rolling
stock,” meaning vaccines will be produced as needed and renewed
on a rolling basis by selected suppliers under contract terms
and conditions set by the OIE, the animal-health group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
