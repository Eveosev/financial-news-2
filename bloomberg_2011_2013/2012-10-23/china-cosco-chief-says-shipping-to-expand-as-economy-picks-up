China  Cosco Holdings Co., the
nation’s largest listed shipping company, said the industry will
expand as Chinese economic growth picks up momentum.  “We’re only beginning to see signs of recovery,” China
Cosco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Wei Jiafu said in an
interview at the Tsinghua Management Global Forum in Beijing
yesterday. “Premier Wen said the Chinese economy has seen a
 turning point  in the third quarter, and it is bullish news for
the shipping industry.”  The government this month announced tax and financial
support for local shipping lines after China Cosco and China
Shipping Container Lines Co. both posted wider first-half losses
amid falling freight rates. A pick-up seen in  Asia ’s largest
economy after seven quarters of slowing growth may also help
boost freight demand.  China Cosco’s general manager Ma Zehua said earlier this
month that 2013 will be a bit better for the industry than this
year because of improvements in the global economy. Still, a
full recovery for the sector isn’t probable in the next two to
three years, he said.  The shipping line has forecast a nine-month loss as rising
capacity in the global fleet and slowing trade sapped cargo
rates. The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a benchmark for commodity-shipping
costs, has plunged 52 percent in the past 12 months.  Reports showed last week that industrial production, retail
sales and fixed-asset investment in China accelerated in
September.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
