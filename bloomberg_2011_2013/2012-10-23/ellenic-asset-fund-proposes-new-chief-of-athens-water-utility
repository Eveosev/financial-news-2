Hellenic Republic Asset Development
Fund, which controls 61 percent of Athens Water Supply & Sewage
Co. SA, proposed Stelios Stavridis as chief executive of
 Greece ’s biggest water utility in an e-mailed statement today.  The fund called for an extraordinary shareholder meeting to
appoint new board members, according to the statement. No
proposed date for the meeting was given.  Greece’s government has pledged to speed up execution of a
state asset sales program that’s part of commitments made to
secure two bailouts from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
