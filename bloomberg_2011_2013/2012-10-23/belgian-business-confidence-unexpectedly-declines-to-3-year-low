Belgian business confidence
unexpectedly fell to the lowest in three years in October, led
by deteriorating sentiment in the manufacturing and building
industries.  The confidence index for  Belgium  dropped to minus 13.5 from
minus 11.6 in September, the Brussels-based National Bank of
Belgium said today in a statement. That’s the lowest since
October 2009. Economists had predicted an increase to minus 11
this month, according to the median of 11 estimates in a
 Bloomberg News survey .  In the manufacturing industry, “assessment of total order
books has worsened,” the central bank said in the report. “The
economic climate in the building industry continues to show a
zig-zag pattern, alternating between losses and revivals of
optimism.”  Confidence also declined in the areas of trade and
business-related services, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
