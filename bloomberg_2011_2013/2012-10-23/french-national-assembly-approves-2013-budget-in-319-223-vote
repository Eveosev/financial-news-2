France ’s  National Assembly  passed
President  Francois Hollande ’s first budget, which relies more on
raising taxes than on spending cuts to reduce the deficit.  Lawmakers in the lower chamber approved the 2013 budget by
319 votes to 223 votes. The bill will be discussed next month in
the Senate and returns to the National Assembly in December for
the final vote. Hollande’s  Socialist Party  and its allies hold a
majority in both chambers of Parliament.  The 2013 blueprint relies on 20 billion euros ($26 billion)
in tax increases, including a levy of 75 percent on incomes over
1 million euros, and a higher  wealth tax . It trims spending by
10 billion euros, bringing the  deficit  to 3 percent of output
from 4.5 percent in 2012. The budget assumes economic growth of
0.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
