Airbus SAS inaugurated the final
assembly line for its A350 wide-body aircraft in Toulouse,
France, ahead of the first test flight next year of the aircraft
that will intensify competition with  Boeing Co. (BA)   The opening of the factory, named Roger Beteille to
celebrate one of Airbus’s founders, was attended by French Prime
Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, who reiterated his country’s
commitment to the A350 program.  The A350 is Airbus’s attempt to gain a bigger slice of the
large, twin-aisle airliner market, a segment now dominated by
Boeing and its 777. Airbus, a unit of Toulouse-based  European
Aeronautic, Defence and Space Co. , was almost three years late
on its most recent new model, the A380, which entered service in
October 2007. Boeing was also three years behind schedule in
getting its 787 into service.  The A350 has 558 firm orders from 35 customers, the
majority for the mid-sized A350-900. The smaller A350-800
version and the larger A350-1000 variant aren’t scheduled for
service until 2017. Airbus initially said the program would cost
about 11 billion euros ($14.33 billion) to develop.  Airbus invested 140 million euros to build the A350
facility, which includes aircraft halls, offices, workshops and
logistics areas, and as taxiways and roads. Airbus expects to
ramp up to building 10 A350s a month by 2018.  The structure of the A350 is about 50 percent composite
materials, compared with 25 percent on the A380. Airbus also
makes the A380 jumbo and the A330 wide-body in Toulouse, while
factories in both Toulouse and Hamburg assemble the A320 single-
aisle models.  To contact the reporter on this story:
