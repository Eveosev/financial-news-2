Kazakhstan lowered its forecast for
economic growth this year as demand wanes for the central Asian
country’s exports of metals, Economic Development and Trade
Minister Erbolat Dosayev said.  Gross domestic product will probably expand 5.4 percent
this year, less than the previous forecast for 5.8 percent,
Dosayev said today at a government meeting in the Kazakh
capital, Astana. President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  predicted 7
percent expansion on May 23.  A slowdown in  China  and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis are
throttling demand for commodities, the mainstay of the economy
of the second-largest oil producer in the former  Soviet Union 
after  Russia . The ministry revised its projection after prices
of uranium, copper, aluminum and zinc dropped by 19 percent or
more in the first eight months from 2011. GDP rose 5.2 percent
in the January-September period from a year earlier, Prime
Minister Serik Akhmetov said today.  Kazakh industrial output may grow 2.7 percent in 2012, 0.9
percentage point less than previously forecast, according to the
Economic Development and Trade Ministry. Industrial production
expanded 0.5 percent in January through September from a year
earlier.  Budget revenue will probably be 383 billion tenge ($2.5
billion) less than planned in 2012, widening the  budget deficit 
to 983.1 billion tenge, or 3.1 percent of economic output, from
779.8 billion tenge, according to the ministry.  A poor grain harvest is also affecting the Kazakh economy.
The harvest may shrink to 12 million metric tons after drying
and cleaning this year, down from a record 26.9 million tons
last year, according to the  Agriculture Ministry . Grain exports
may fall to 8 million metric tons from a previous target of 10
million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
