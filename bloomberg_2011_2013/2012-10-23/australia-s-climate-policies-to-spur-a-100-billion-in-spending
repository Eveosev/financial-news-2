Australia ’s policies to mitigate
 climate change  and promote the use of clean energy will likely
drive investment of A$100 billion ($103 billion) during the next
four decades, Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency
 Greg Combet  said.  To extend its action on climate change, the government
intends linking with emissions trading schemes in New Zealand
and throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Combet said in a speech
delivered today in Sydney.  The Australian government has set a price of A$23 a metric
ton on carbon emissions for about 300 of its largest polluters
for the year that started on July 1, with a market-based price
scheduled to begin in 2015.  Opposition leader  Tony Abbott  has pledged to repeal what he
calls a “toxic” carbon tax should his Liberal-National coalition
win power in the next election.  A market-based approach is best for an orderly, planned and
gradual transition to a low carbon economy, Combet said.  “Businesses and investors are making decisions based on
the carbon price,” Combet said. “Repealing the carbon price
would be damaging to investment confidence and undermine the
business decisions that have already been taken.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
