Most Japanese  stocks  fell, led by
nuclear-power generators. The declines were limited as exporters
climbed after the yen touched a three-month low amid speculation
the central bank will add to stimulus programs.  Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503) , Japan’s second-biggest
generation company by revenue, sank 13 percent on a report the
utility won’t pay a dividend for the first time in 61 years. GS
Yuasa Corp. plunged 13 percent after the battery maker cut its
earnings forecast. Nikon Corp., a camera maker that gets about
85 percent of its sales overseas, rose 1.6 percent after the yen
briefly weakened below 80 against the dollar, boosting the
earnings outlook for the exporter.  The Topix Index slid 0.6 percent to 749.37 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , retreating for a second day after the gauge last
week recording its biggest weekly gain since Dec. 2. More than
two shares dropped for each that gained. The  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average (NKY)  added less than 0.1 percent to 9,014.25, after rising as
much as 0.7 percent. Volume on the gauge was almost 10 percent
above the 30-day average.  “Long-term investors are taking a wait-and-see stance as
earnings momentum is getting sluggish,” said Kenichi Kubo, a
senior fund manager at Tokio Marine Asset Management Co., which
oversees 5.6 trillion yen ($70 billion). “Some investors are
selling shares to lock in profit after gauges rose close to the
peaks of August and September.”  Companies in the Nikkei 225 report an average of 28 percent
of sales from outside Japan, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Members of the Topix get 13 percent of sales from
overseas, the data show.  Stimulus Measures  The Nikkei 225 has risen 3.8 percent since Sept. 6, as  the
European Central Bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of
 Japan  adding to measures designed to boost growth. Shares on the
stock gauge traded at 1.2 times book value, compared with 2.2
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx
600 Index.  Japan’s current earnings season peaks next week, with 570
of the 1,672 Topix companies reporting results. Nintendo Co. and
steelmaker JFE Holdings Inc. are among 124 companies scheduled
to post this week.  Kansai Electric tumbled 13 percent to 595 yen after the
Nikkei newspaper reported the utility won’t pay an annual
dividend for the first time since fiscal 1951, as earnings are
unlikely to recover on rising costs of fuel to cover halted
nuclear reactors. Kansai Electric said in a release it hasn’t
decided on the year-end dividend payout. Utilities declined the
most in the Topix’s 33 industry group.  GS Yuasa (6674)  plunged 13 percent to 314 yen, the biggest drop
since June 2009, after cutting its net-income forecast by 39
percent to 8 billion yen for the year ending March 31, hurt by a
plunge in sales of lithium ion batteries used for electric cars.  Yen Falls  The yen depreciated to as low as 80.01 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, the weakest level since July 6. Against the
euro, Japan’s currency touched to 104.59, the lowest level since
May. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Nikon gained 1.6 percent to 2,044 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , the
world’s biggest maker of factory robotics, climbed 1.9 percent
to 13,200 yen.  “The yen is likely to remain weak until the Bank of
Japan’s Oct. 30 meeting on expectations the central bank will
add stimulus,” said Tokio Marine Asset Management’s Kubo.  Japan may extend its dollar-loan program beyond March 31 to
help companies like Softbank Corp. buy overseas assets and stem
the yen’s rise, Vice-Finance Minister  Tsutomu Okubo  said in an
interview yesterday in Tokyo.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  advanced 3.8
percent to 19.75, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.7
percent on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
