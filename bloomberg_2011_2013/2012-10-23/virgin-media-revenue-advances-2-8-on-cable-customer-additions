Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) , the U.K.’s
second-largest pay-television company, reported third-quarter
sales rose 2.8 percent as it kept more cable customers.  Revenue rose to 1.03 billion pounds ($1.65 billion) from 1
billion pounds, the company said in a statement today. That was
in line with the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Virgin Media, based in Hook,  England , reported net cable
customer additions of 39,500 in the quarter compared with 6,300
a year earlier. While the company is attracting the same number
of new subscribers, it has reduced customer defections, Chief
Financial Officer Eamonn O’Hare said in an interview.  “New customer additions was pretty much the same as a year
ago, but we had less customers leave us,” O’Hare said. “The
truth is today, they look around and say they can’t get much
better for less.”  The company has been making its Internet service,
advertised by runners Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, more attractive
for customers by increasing Web speeds. O’Hare said that 44
percent of new customers chose to take the company’s fastest
broadband product.  Free cash flow declined 11 percent to 120 million pounds in
the quarter as the company invested in building out its network.
Operating cash flow rose 6.1 percent from a year earlier to 423
million pounds.  Mobile revenue declined 3.1 percent to 137 million pounds
and the business division increased sales 9.5 percent to 169
million pounds.  Virgin Media rose 7 cents to $32.87 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading yesterday. The shares gained 54 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
