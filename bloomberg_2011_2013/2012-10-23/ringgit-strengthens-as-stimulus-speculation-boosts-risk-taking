Malaysia’s ringgit erased gains as
concern  China ’s economic growth will slow further dimmed the
outlook for the nation’s exports.  Government bonds  rose.  The Shanghai Composite Index of stocks fell 0.9 percent,
the  most  in almost four weeks. Citigroup cut China’s growth
forecast for this year to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent, analysts
including Shuang Ding and Minggao Shen wrote in a research
report dated Oct. 19. China was the second-biggest buyer of
Malaysian goods in August.  “Concern that China may see slower-than-expected growth is
damping demand for riskier assets,’ said Yeah Kim Leng, chief
economist at RAM Holdings Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Trading in the
ringgit will continue to be choppy in the near-term.”  The currency weakened 0.2 percent to 3.0568 per dollar as
of 5:15 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency climbed as much as 0.2 percent earlier.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage
point, to 6.1 percent, the least since July 20.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics purchasing managers’
index of Chinese manufacturing was at 47.9 in September,
contracting for an 11th straight month.  Malaysian government bonds rose, with the yield on the
3.418 percent notes maturing in August 2022 declining one basis
point to 3.44 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The treasury
will auction 3 billion ringgit ($982 million) of similar-
maturity securities on Oct. 30, the central bank said on its
website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
