The cost to guard against losses on
the debt of  H&R Block Inc. (HRB)  jumped the most in six months after
the company issued debt to refinance $600 million of obligations
due in 2013.  Credit-default swaps tied to the company’s Block Financial
unit rose 52 basis points to 336 basis points as of 9:18 a.m. in
New York, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. That’s the biggest advance since
they increased 112.8 basis points April 25.  The largest U.S. tax preparer yesterday sold $500 million
of debt in its first benchmark offering in almost five years.
Proceeds will probably be used to repay its 7.875 percent bonds
due in January, the company said in a regulatory filing.  The new 5.5 percent notes due November 2022 traded at 98
cents on the dollar to yield 5.77 percent at 9:46 a.m.,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Banks,  hedge funds  and other money managers had bought and
sold credit swaps that protect against a default on a  net $1
billion  of the  Kansas City , Missouri-based company’s obligations
as of Oct. 12, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing
Corp., which runs a central repository for the market.  The level of Block Financial credit swaps, which typically
rise as investor confidence deteriorates and falls as it
improves, means investors would have to pay $336,000 annually to
protect $10 million of the company’s debt for five years. Credit
swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
