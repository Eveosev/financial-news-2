The pound stayed higher against the
euro after a report showed mortgage approvals rose to a five-
month high in September.  Britainâ€™s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 81.40 pence
per euro at 9:32 a.m. London time and was little changed at
$1.6009.  Mortgage approvals rose to 31,175 last month from 30,683 in
August, the British Bankers Association said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
