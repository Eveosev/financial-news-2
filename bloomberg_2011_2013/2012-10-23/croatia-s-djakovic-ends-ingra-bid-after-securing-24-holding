Djuro Djakovic d.d. ,  Croatia ’s
largest heavy-vehicle maker, said it would end its bid to
acquire  Ingra d.d. , a Zagreb-based construction company, after
shareholders showed insufficient interest.  Djakovic secured a 23.5 percent stake in Ingra compared
with the 95 percent holding it needed, the company said in a
statement published today on the  Zagreb stock exchange . The bid,
in which Djakovic offered 6 kuna ($1) per share, was placed on
Sept. 14 and was valid through Oct. 19.  Djakovic is based in Slavonski Brod, Croatia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
