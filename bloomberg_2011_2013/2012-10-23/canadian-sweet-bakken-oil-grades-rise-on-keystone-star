Canadian and Bakken crude grades
strengthened against the benchmark U.S. oil price as TransCanada
Corp.’s Keystone pipeline returned to service.  The 590,000-barrel-a-day pipeline was shut down
unexpectedly for five days, constraining crude flows from  Canada 
and North Dakota, when an “anomaly” was found on the pipeline
during routine work. The line will run at reduced pressure
today, TransCanada spokesman James Millar said in an e-mail.  Syncrude, a synthetic light Canadian blend, regained its
premium to West Texas Intermediate, rising $3.25 to trade at 75
cents a barrel above WTI at noon in New York, according to data
collected by Bloomberg. It was trading at a $4 premium before
the Keystone maintenance began.  Bakken crude from North Dakota halved its discount to $1 a
barrel below WTI. It had traded at a $1.75 premium before the
Keystone maintenance. Keystone doesn’t transport Bakken crude,
though the grade competes for space with Canadian crudes on
Enbridge Inc.’s pipeline that carries oil to the U.S. Midwest.  The spread between WTI and North Sea Brent crude widened
for a second day, increasing 2.9 percent to $21.40 a barrel,
making imported oil more expensive and boosting the price of
some crude grades produced in the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium widened $1.50 to $20.75 a
barrel, while Heavy Louisiana Sweet increased $1.50 to $20.75
over WTI.  Among sour grades Mars Blend gained $1.50 to trade at
$14.50 a barrel above WTI, and Poseidon rose $1.25 to a $13.75
premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
