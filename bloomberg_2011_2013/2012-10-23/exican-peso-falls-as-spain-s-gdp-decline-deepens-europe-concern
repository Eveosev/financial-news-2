Mexico ’s peso fell the most in three
months after Spain said its economy shrank last quarter,
deepening concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will erode global
growth and curb demand for Latin American exports.  The currency tumbled 0.9 percent to 12.9752 per U.S. dollar
at 4 p.m. in Mexico City. The slide, the biggest on a closing
basis since July 23, pared the peso’s advance this year to 7.4
percent, still the best performance among the dollar’s 16 most-
traded counterparts.  Developing-nation currencies slumped worldwide after a
report showed Spain’s gross domestic product contracted for a
fifth quarter, falling an estimated 0.4 percent.  “The uncertainty in Europe is one factor and a key one at
that” for a weaker peso, Aryam Vazquez, an economist for global
 emerging markets  at Wells Fargo & Co., said in an e-mailed
message. “The ongoing saga with Spain is feeding into a
stronger dollar.”  The peso also slumped as oil dropped to a three-month low
in New York. Crude is Mexico’s second-biggest export.  Yields on Mexico’s local currency bonds due in 2024 rose
one basis point, 0.01 percentage point, to 5.56 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price decreased
0.15 centavo to 139.15 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
