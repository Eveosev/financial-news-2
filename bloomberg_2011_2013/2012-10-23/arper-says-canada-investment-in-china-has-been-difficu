Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said Chinese companies have been able to invest easily in
 Canada , while his country’s investments in China have been more
difficult.  “Canada has had a situation with the People’s Republic of
China for some years where their investment has been virtually
unrestricted here and we have had more difficulty with our
investment there,” Harper said in response to a question in the
House of Commons in Ottawa today about a foreign investment
protection agreement.  Harper called that agreement “an important step forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
