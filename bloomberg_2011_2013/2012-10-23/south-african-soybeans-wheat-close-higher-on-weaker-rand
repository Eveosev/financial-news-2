South African soybeans, wheat and
yellow corn rose as a weaker currency neutralized lower prices
in the U.S.  The most active soybean contract, for delivery in December,
rose 0.5 percent to 5,600 rand ($640) a metric ton in
Johannesburg, while the commodity lost 0.6 percent to $15.40 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 12:28 p.m. The rand
declined 1.3 percent, the most since Oct. 5, to 8.7542 a dollar.  “Soybeans were down substantially in Chicago,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd, said by phone from  Pretoria .
“The rand neutralized this movement.”  The price of soybeans in Chicago declined after a U.S.
Department of Agriculture report showed that 80 percent of the
current  harvest  was collected by Oct. 21 compared with an
average of 69 percent from 2007 to 2011.  Wheat is trading at import parity, or the price paid to
deliver it in South Africa, Van Wyk said. The most actively
traded contract, for delivery in December, rose for the fourth
day, gained 0.4 percent to 3,611 rand a ton.  Yellow corn, used mainly as animal feed, rose 0.1 percent
to 2,539 rand a ton. White corn, which is a staple in South
Africa, declined for a second day, losing 0.8 percent to 2,509
rand a ton with 2,032 contracts bought and sold.  “Speculators are busy in the white corn market,” Van Wyk
said. “They can get in and out of the market as there are large
volumes of contracts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
