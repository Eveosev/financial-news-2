Iron ore  will probably advance this
quarter to levels last seen in July as steelmakers in  China , the
biggest buyer, rebuild inventories on speculation that the
country’s pace of economic growth will pick up, said UBS AG.  Prices for ore delivered in China may climb to about $120 a
ton to $125 a ton, commodities analyst  Tom Price  said today. On
a free-on-board basis, the price may average $115 a ton from
$105.60 a ton in the previous three-month period, he said.  The steel-making material delivered to the port of Tianjin
rose 1.9 percent to $117.50 a  dry ton  yesterday, up 13 percent
this month, according to data compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  China’s growth cooled last quarter to 7.4 percent, from 7.6
percent in the period ended June. Growth will rebound to 7.7
percent in this quarter, the median of economists’ estimates in
a Bloomberg survey shows. Premier  Wen Jiabao  on Oct. 17 said the
economy has started to stabilize. Steelmakers raised daily
output to a three-month high in September, according to monthly
data collated by the National Bureau of Statistics.  “ China’s economy  is still functioning, it still needs
steel and it’s still going through a materials-intensive  growth 
cycle,” Price said from Sydney. “I’m expecting a seasonal
restocking of raw materials and a lift in steel production.”  Infrastructure Plans  Iron ore slumped 22 percent in the third quarter, plunging
to a near three-year low of $86.70 on Sept. 5, on concern
slowing growth in China will curb demand. It has rebounded 35
percent since Sept. 6, when the country announced plans to boost
infrastructure spending. The government also raised planned
rail-infrastructure investment this year to 516 billion yuan
($83 billion) on Oct. 10, from an earlier 496 billion yuan.  China boosted iron ore  imports  4.1 percent to 65.01 million
metric tons in September, the highest since January 2011,
according to the customs bureau. Inventories of the ore held at
Chinese ports have dropped 3.7 percent to 96.35 million tons as
of Oct. 12, from a record 100.1 million tons set in July,
according to data from Shanghai Steelhome Information.  Steel reinforcement bar futures fell as much as 2.1 percent
to 3,653  yuan  a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange today on
speculation steelmakers are boosting production of the
construction raw material. Daily steel output climbed 2 percent
to 1.93 million tons a day last month from August, the highest
level since June, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.  Iron ore is measured in dry tons, or metric tons less
moisture. At Tianjin port moisture can account for 8 percent to
10 percent of the ore’s weight.  To contact the reporter for this story:
