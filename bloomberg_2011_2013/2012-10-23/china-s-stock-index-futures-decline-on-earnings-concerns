China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index down by the most in almost four weeks, on
concern the nation’s economic and earnings outlook is worsening
before a report on manufacturing scheduled for tomorrow.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (600585) , which releases its third-quarter
earnings tomorrow, slid 4 percent after KGI Securities said
demand growth is limited and cement price gains in eastern  China 
are nearing an end.  Shenzhen Hongtao Decoration Co. (002325)  tumbled 10
percent after the company cut its earnings forecast. Foreign
buyers attending the Canton trade fair declined 11.4 percent
from the spring session, the China Daily reported, while
Citigroup Inc. cut its 2012 economic growth estimates for China.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.9 percent to 2,114.45
at the close, its biggest loss since Sept. 26. The  CSI 300 (SHSZ300) 
dropped 1.3 percent to 2,312.08. Hong Kong’s stock market was
shut for a holiday. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  added 1.2
percent in New York yesterday.  “We’re not certain the economic recovery can carry on,”
said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities Co. in
 Shanghai . “Looking ahead, there isn’t any positive news flow
that investors can use as an excuse to buy stocks.”  The Shanghai Composite had rebounded 5.5 percent since
reaching a three-year low on Sept. 26 on expectations regulators
will introduce measures to stabilize the market ahead of a once-
in-a-decade power transition of the Communist Party. The
Shanghai gauge is still down 3.9 percent this year and trades at
9.9 times estimated earnings for this year, compared with the
17.8 average since Bloomberg began compiling the weekly  data  in
2006.  Flash PMI  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics are due to release a
preliminary reading of China’s October manufacturing index
tomorrow. The purchasing managers’ index was at 47.9 in
September, contracting for an 11th straight month.  Citigroup cut China’s growth forecast for this year to 7.7
percent from 7.9 percent, Shuang Ding, Minggao Shen and Serena
Wang, analysts at the  U.S. bank , wrote in a report dated Oct.
19. Fourth-quarter growth may rebound to 7.8 percent, according
to the report.  Foreign buyers attending the bi-annual Canton trade fair
declined 11.4 percent from the spring session during the first
four days, the  China Daily  reported, citing statistics from the
event organizers. Transaction values for machinery and
electronics goods fell 23.1 percent with  Europe  and dropped 0.1
percent with  Africa , the newspaper said.  Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, retreated 4
percent to 16.24 yuan. Demand growth is limited and cement
price gains in eastern China are nearing an end, according to
a report by KGI Securities dated yesterday. KGI forecasts
“flat” eastern China cement prices in the first half of 2013.  Slumping Profits  The company is expected to report 0.26 yuan earnings per
share for the third quarter, down 54 percent from a year
earlier, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese industrial companies’ profits dropped 6.2 percent
in August from a year earlier, the largest decline this year and
the fifth straight monthly deceleration, a statistics bureau
report showed last month. Data for September are due Oct. 27.  Shenzhen Hongtao plunged by the daily limit of 10 percent
to 16.68  yuan . Profit probably rose between 30 percent and 50
percent from a year earlier in the first nine months, the
company said in a statement yesterday. That compared with an
August forecast of a gain of between 60 percent 90 percent.
Revenue was lower than expected because of slowing progress in
big projects, according to the statement.  Deflationary Pressure  Shanxi Coking Co. (600740) , the largest publicly traded coke
producer in China, lost 1.2 percent to 8.63 yuan after third-
quarter profit dropped 74 percent from a year earlier.  About 10 percent of the 934 companies in the Shanghai
Composite have announced third-quarter earnings, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg. Listed companies are required to
release third-quarter reports by the end of the month.  Chinese factories are losing pricing power in the worst
wholesale-cost  deflation  since 2009, signaling corporate
earnings may deteriorate further and putting a damper on global
inflation pressures.  Steelmaker  China Oriental Group Co. (581)  says falling prices are
wiping out profits, while  Yunnan Copper Industry Co. (000878)  cited the
declines for a third-quarter loss. The producer-price index fell
3.6 percent in September from a year earlier and may stay
negative until the second half of 2013 without large stimulus,
according to Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.  CSRC Measures  Last month’s 3.6 percent drop in wholesale prices from a
year earlier was the seventh straight decline and biggest since
October 2009. The decline was caused primarily by weak demand
and also by overcapacity,  Sheng Laiyun , spokesman for the
National Bureau of Statistics, said at a press briefing Oct. 18.  Train-related stocks rose after the Economic Information
Daily reported China added 13 railway infrastructure projects to
this year’s construction investment plans.  CSR Corp. (601766) , the nation’s biggest train maker, advanced 1.2
percent to 4.34 yuan. China CNR Corp., the second largest, added
0.8 percent to 3.88 yuan.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission is studying
measures to further lower trading costs for investors, Chairman
 Guo Shuqing  wrote in an article published in Administration
Reform, a magazine published by the Chinese Academy of
Governance. There were no further details.  This year, the CSRC has expedited approvals of foreign
investors, cut stock-trading fees by 25 percent and called on
listed companies to pay more dividends as part of efforts to
boost the market. The People’s Bank of China has cut  interest
rates  twice since early June and lowered lenders’ reserve
requirement ratios three times from last November.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 19.9
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.2. About 7.2
billion shares changed hands in the gauge, 6.5 percent lower
than the daily average in 2012.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
