Indian stocks dropped, mirroring
losses in Asian and European equities, after earnings reports
from Taiwan to Sweden disappointed investors and as Moody’s
Investors Service cut credit ratings on five Spanish regions.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, fell 0.4 percent
to 18,710.02 at the close.  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL) , India’s biggest
motorcycle-maker, slumped 1.8 percent before an earnings report
showed profit fell for the first time in six quarters.  Jindal
Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP)  sank 2.4 percent, the most on the Sensex.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slid 0.5 percent as companies
including Acer Inc. announced lower-than-expected profits amid a
global economic slowdown. Of the 47 companies on the regional
benchmark index that reported quarterly earnings since Oct. 1,
57 percent missed estimates and 43 percent beat expectations,
data compiled by Bloomberg News show. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) 
lost 0.9 percent in London as results from companies including
Alfa Laval AB and D.E Master Blenders 1753 NV disappointed
investors.  “Global earnings haven’t been too encouraging and Indian
markets can’t function in isolation given the impact events
worldwide have on foreign inflows into the country,” K.K. Mital, a New-Delhi based fund manager at Globe Capital Market
Ltd., said by phone today. “Indian earnings have surprised
pleasantly but concerns on the global front remain.”  More than 100 companies in  Australia ,  China , India, Japan,
South Korea and  Taiwan  are due to announce earnings this week.
Indian markets are closed tomorrow for a public holiday.  European Union  Moody’s lowered its rating for Catalonia and four other
Spanish regions, citing “deterioration in their liquidity
positions.” Concerns about the country’s creditworthiness have
grown since Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy requested as much as
100 billion euros in European Union aid to boost Spanish banks
amid signs the country may miss its budget deficit goals. The
European Union took in 17 percent of Indian exports in the six
months ended September 2011, government data show, making it
India’s largest trading partner.  The Sensex has surged 21 percent this year as  foreigners 
bought a net $18.1 billion of domestic shares, the most among 10
Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding China. The gauge
increased 7.7 percent last month, the most since January, as
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh opened the retailing and airline
industries to foreigners, cut fuel subsidies and lowered a tax
on companies’ overseas borrowings to revive an economy growing
at the slowest pace in three years.  IMF Forecast  India ’s  gross domestic product  expanded 5.5 percent in the
June quarter from a year ago, a pace close to the three-year low
of 5.3 percent in the first quarter.  Economic growth  may weaken
to a decade-low of 4.9 percent in 2012 after investment stalled
even as Singh pursues the revamp, forecasts from the
International Monetary Fund showed on Oct. 9.  The Sensex is valued at 14.8 times  estimated earnings ,
compared with a multiple of 11.5 times for the  MSCI Emerging
Markets Index (MXEF) , which has risen 9.2 percent in 2012.  Profit at only one out of the 10 Sensex firms that have
reported earnings for the September quarter has trailed analyst
forecasts, compared with 40 percent of the index members in the
June quarter and 30 percent in the previous three months, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Earnings beats have outnumbered misses with 39 percent of
 BSE-100 Index (BSE100)  companies reporting a positive surprise, as
opposed to 31 percent reporting negative surprise,” Barclays
Capital analysts led by  Bhuvnesh Singh  said in a note yesterday.  Hero retreated 1.8 percent to 1,795.75 rupees, the most
since Sept. 27.  Net income  dropped 27 percent to 4.41 billion
rupees ($82 million), the company said in a filing today. That
compared with the 4.4 billion-rupee median of 40 analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Metal Stocks  Copper producer  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT)  posted a
group profit of 17.4 billion rupees, exceeding the 12.2-billion
rupee median of 26 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The
stock slid 0.8 percent to 98.5 rupees before the results, which
were announced after trading ended.  Jindal Steel sank 2.4 percent to 390.75 rupees in a third
day of declines that took the stock to its lowest close since
Sept. 14.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , the largest producer of cigarettes, lost 1.4
percent to 290 rupees. Software exporter  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the only
Sensex member to have missed estimates so far this season, lost
1.4 percent to 2,353.10 rupees, the lowest since Sept. 5.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT)  climbed for a second day, adding 1.8
percent to 1,701.35 rupees, the highest level since Sept. 8. It
yesterday announced a better-than-estimated 43 percent jump in
net income.  The S&P  CNX Nifty Index (NIFTY)  dropped 0.5 percent to 5,691.40
while its October futures traded settled at 5,695.50. India VIX,
which gauges the cost of protection against losses in the Nifty
index, jumped 5.1 percent to 13.71, rebounding from yesterday’s
record low. The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. and the
BSE Ltd.  traded  708 million shares yesterday, compared with a
12-month daily average of 912 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
