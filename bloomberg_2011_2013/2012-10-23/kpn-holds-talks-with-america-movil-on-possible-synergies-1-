Royal KPN NV (KPN)  is in talks with
investor  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  to shape cooperation efforts after
 Carlos Slim ’s wireless carrier obtained more than a quarter of
the Dutch telecom operator’s shares in an unsolicited bid.  “Our relationship is fine,” Chief Executive Officer Eelco Blok of the Hague-based KPN, said on a conference call today.
“We are in talks to explore synergies. Initially this is just
between us and America Movil, but it is obvious Telekom Austria
could be involved in the talks in a later stage.”  Carlos Slim, the world’s richest man, has expanded  America
Movil into Europe to take advantage of phone company valuations
that have fallen during the euro-region crisis. The Mexican
company said it bought 28 percent of KPN in June, the same month
it purchased a stake in  Telekom Austria (TKA)  AG.  KPN’s description of the talks as “constructive”
contrasts with its original position on America Movil’s 2.6
billion-euro ($3.4 billion) bid for a stake. The Dutch operator
asked shareholders to ignore the offer and unsuccessfully held
talks on a potential merger involving its E-Plus wireless unit
in  Germany .  KPN shares fell 1 percent to 5.74 euros as of 10:35 a.m. in
Amsterdam after the company said third-quarter profit fell 32
percent amid increasing price competition in Germany and a
decline in mobile subscription revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
