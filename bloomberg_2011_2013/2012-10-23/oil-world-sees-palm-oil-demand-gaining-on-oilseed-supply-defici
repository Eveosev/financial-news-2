Palm-oil  prices are set for a
“pronounced recovery” as global demand for vegetable oils
outpaces consumption, Oil World said.  Futures may rally to 3,300 ringgit ($1,080) a metric ton by
March or April in Kuala Lumpur trading, the Hamburg-based
researcher said in an e-mailed report. The most-active contract
last touched that price on May 11. The oil for January delivery
traded at 2,541 ringgit a ton today on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange. Futures are down 20 percent this year on higher
stockpiles in Indonesia and Malaysia, the two largest producers.  The 2012-13 marketing year begun Sept. 1 may be the first
in 20 years in which total global seed-oil output will fail to
increase, Oil World said. Global consumption of eight major
vegetable oils may total 153.86 million tons, outpacing
production of 153.05 million tons, the researcher said.  “We expect a pronounced recovery in palm-oil prices due to
strong demand and spill-over strength from other vegetable
oils,” Oil World said. Declining supplies of soybeans, rapeseed
and sunflower seed will “significantly raise world demand for
palm oil, which has to fill the gap,” it said.  World palm-oil inventories reached a record 9.2 million
tons at the end of September, Oil World said. The researcher
expects global production to total 52.28 million tons this year,
up from 50.42 tons in the past season.  Global exports of palm oil may rise to 42.6 million tons
this year, the highest in at least five years, according to the
report. Combined shipments of  soybean oil , rapeseed oil and
sunflower-seed oil may drop to 19.14 million tons, 5.8 percent
less than the previous season.  World production of eight oilseed meals may total 273.09
million tons in the 2012-13 season, up from 270.03 million tons
last year, Oil World said. Soybean-meal production may rise 2.9
percent to 183.73 million tons as output rebounds in  South
America  starting in April. Output of seven other meals may
decline 2.4 percent on reduced crushing of sunflower seed,
cotton seed, rapeseed and ground nuts, Oil World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
