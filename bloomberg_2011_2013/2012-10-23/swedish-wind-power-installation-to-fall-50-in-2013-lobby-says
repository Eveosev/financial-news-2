Sweden  will build an estimated 500
megawatts of wind-power capacity in 2013, about half as much as
this year, the Swedish Wind Energy Association said.  The capacity growth would be “the least in several
years,” Mattias Wondollek, project manager at the country’s
wind energy association, said today in an e-mailed statement.
“Considerably lower subsidies for renewables combined with
lower power prices are prompting several developers to wait and
see rather than build new plants.”  An EU  directive  from 2009 requires all member states to
increase the proportion of renewable energy production in gross
final energy consumption so that the bloc reaches an overall 20
percent share by 2020. The target for Sweden is 49 percent,
compared with a 39.8 percent share in 2005.  A total of 457 turbines with capacity of 1,078 megawatts
will come online this year, bringing Sweden’s total installed
wind power to 3,977 megawatts, according to the association.
That could provide an average annual output of 7.2 terawatt-
hours, it said.  Investors have obtained permits for a total of 3,800
megawatts of new wind power, while licensing is underway for an
additional 9,000 megawatts, all of which could become
operational before 2016, if the government makes sure the
projects become viable to build, it said.  Wind parks in Sweden accounted for 4.5 percent or 7
terawatt-hours of the nation’s electricity in the year through
Sept. 23, the power industry association said on its website.
Total turbine capacity was 2,935 megawatts at the end of June,
according to the latest data from the Swedish Energy Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
