The Canadian dollar fell to a more
than two-month low versus its U.S. counterpart on speculation
the Bank of  Canada  will abandon its stance as the only Group of
Seven central bank with a bias to tighten policy.  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
waterfowl on the C$1 coin, fell versus a majority of its most-
traded peers. Central-bank Governor Mark Carney suggested in an
Oct. 15 speech that today’s economic forecast will reflect a
slow global recovery.  “While the rate decision is of course not in doubt, it is
the accompanying language within the statement that will be
paramount to Canadian dollar performance,”  Jeremy Stretch ,
executive director of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London , said in a note to clients.  Canada’s currency declined 0.4 percent to 99.66 cents per
U.S. dollar at 7:57 a.m. in Toronto. The currency fell as low as
99.70 cents, the least since Aug. 10. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0034.  Yields on two-year government  bonds  fell five basis points
last week to 1.09 percent, the most since Sept. 28, after
Statistics Canada said Oct. 19 that the core inflation rate
slowed to 1.3 percent from 1.6 percent in August, the least in
more than a year. The data supported views that Carney may drop
language he’s used since April that raising the policy rate “may
become appropriate” as the economy approaches full output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
