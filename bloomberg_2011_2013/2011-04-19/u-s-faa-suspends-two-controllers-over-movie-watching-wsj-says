The U.S.  Federal Aviation
Administration  suspended an air traffic controller and his
supervisor after the controller broke contact with aircraft by
inadvertently playing the soundtrack of a movie he was watching
while on duty, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing the FAA.  The controller, based in Cleveland, was using a portable
DVD player to watch the film and the soundtrack went out over
the airwaves after he mistakenly activated his microphone,
blocking radio transmissions from aircraft on his frequency for
more than two minutes, the newspaper reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
