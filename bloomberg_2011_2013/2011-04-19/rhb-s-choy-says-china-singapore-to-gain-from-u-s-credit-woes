Ray Choy, head of debt-market
research at RHB Research Institute in  Kuala Lumpur , comments on
the U.S. credit-rating outlook and the market implications for
Asian sovereign debt.  Standard & Poor’s  cut the outlook on the U.S. top AAA
rating yesterday, citing a one-in-three chance of a downgrade
within two years on debt concern. Choy made the comments in a
phone interview.  “The search for the next best reserve-currency proxy could
lead to flows initially to the G-3 sovereign markets in Germany
and  Japan . However, this is likely to be short-lived given low
yields and continued questions over the long-term sustainability
of high G-3 sovereign ratings.  “Selective emerging markets with sound macroeconomic
policies and higher yields in Asia outside Japan stand to
benefit from the increased downgrade risk to G-3 economies. We
should continue to see a trend of narrowing differentials
relative to the high-grade G-3 economies.  “Although  China  is also attached with a negative outlook,
it has a relatively more attractive risk-reward profile. The U.S.
already has the top rating with no upside potential, and the
risk-reward is skewed to the downside.  “We foresee greater downward pressure on the  U.S. dollar 
this year and next year, and added upside risks on U.S. Treasury
yields. Hence, capital flows would benefit well-managed
economies in emerging markets and in Asia outside Japan. These
would include China, Singapore and Malaysia.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
