Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , said it will
appeal the Peruvian government’s rejection of its $900 million
Tia Maria copper project as it seeks to boost output.  The company will seek talks with Peru’s next president when
the person takes office July 28 about the project, Chief
Executive Officer Oscar Gonzalez Rocha said on a conference call
today with analysts. The government rejected an environmental
study for Tia Maria April 8, saying it was “unviable.”  “We’re going to insist with the new government as soon as
it takes its place,” Gonzalez said. “In case we can’t get the
Tia Maria project underway, we’ll have $350 million worth of
equipment to be used in different areas of Mexico and  Peru .”  Southern Copper  is counting on its Tia Maria mine to help
double the company’s annual output to as much as 1 million
metric tons within five years. Peru’s Energy & Mines Ministry
canceled the project after farmers’ protests left three dead in
the southern Andes earlier this montb.  Presidential candidates Ollanta Humala and Keiko Fujimori
face each other in a June 5 runoff.  Southern Copper rose 0.4 percent to $35.885 at 1:40 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has dropped
27 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
