Kaushik Basu , chief economic
adviser of  India ’s finance ministry, comments on inflation. He
was speaking at the sidelines of an event in New Delhi today.  “Inflation has come down from where it was last year and I
am expecting that April inflation will be a percentage point
lower than where it was in March. I would expect it to be less
than 8 percent. That’s not good enough, but you have to keep in
mind that global crude prices are very high.  ‘‘It is worrying and we will have to see what further
actions we may have to take. I can’t speculate on whether the
measures will be monetary or fiscal. Some of these measures have
to be quite different from those we are used to because this is
a new kind of inflation, given the commodity price situation and
easy money policy being followed in the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
