Saab Automobile, the carmaker that
was forced to halt vehicle assembly amid a payment dispute with
suppliers, said it hopes to resume production next week.  “Probably next week, that’s what we’re aiming for,”
Matthias Seidl, vice president of global sales at Saab, said
today in an interview in  New York .  The Swedish government approved a finance plan, with
conditions, for the Trollhaettan, Sweden-based automaker last
week, freeing up collateral used by Saab to back a loan from the
 European Investment Bank .  Saab first suspended manufacturing on March 29 after
component makers stopped deliveries and demanded payment. Saab
Chief Executive Officer Jan-Aake Jonsson said April 4 that the
carmaker’s liquidity “became more strained” during the second
half of the first quarter.  The finance plan still needs to be cleared by the  European
Investment Bank  and faces certain conditions, Maud Olofsson,
Sweden’s industry minister, said last week. If approved, it
would give Saab some breathing space while it awaits a
government decision on whether it can bring in Russian banker
 Vladimir Antonov  as an investor.  Saab is talking with its suppliers and hopes to resume
receiving parts by the end of the week, said Seidl, who is
serving as the interim chief operating officer of Saab’s North
America operations.  Saab Automobile is owned by Zeewolde, Netherlands-based
 Spyker Cars NV. (SPYKR)   To contact the reporter on this story:
