Troops from Persian Gulf nations
will remain in Bahrain as a counter to Iran, the Bahraini
foreign minister, Sheikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa, said in a
posting on Twitter.  Bahrain declared a three-month state of emergency on March
15 after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf states arrived
to help quell protests led by majority Shiite Muslims, who are
calling for more democracy and civil rights.  “They are there for a mission protecting our vital
institutions against foreign threat,” Sheikh Khalid told
reporters yesterday in Dubai when asked about how long the Gulf
troops would stay. “I cannot give you a timetable but
indefinite is not in the picture now.”  Some groups have escalated their demands since protests
began two months ago to include the overthrow of the Sunni
Muslim rulers, the Al-Khalifa family, and the creation of a
republic.  “The situation is developing positively, that may not
require an extension,” the minister said yesterday when asked
whether a state of emergency would continue. The law stands for
three months before an extension is needed.  The minister also said yesterday that he has sent a letter
to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon regarding  Iran ’s
involvement in the country’s unrest. Iran is ruled by Shiite
Muslims.  To contact the reporters on this story:
