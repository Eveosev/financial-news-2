Chauncey Billups won’t play for the
 New York Knicks  against the  Boston Celtics  in the National
Basketball Association playoffs tonight because of a strained
left knee.  The point guard, 34, said he’ll have a scan on the injury
tomorrow as a precaution.  Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni announced Billups’s absence
shortly before the start of Game 2. Billups was injured with
less than a minute remaining in Boston’s 87-85 win two days ago
in the first game in the best-of-seven series.  D’Antoni said he didn’t know if Billups will be ready for
Game 3 on April 22 at New York’s Madison Square Garden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
