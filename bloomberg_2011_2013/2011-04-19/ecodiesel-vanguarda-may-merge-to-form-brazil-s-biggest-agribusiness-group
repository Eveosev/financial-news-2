Spanish billionaire Enrique Banuelos is seeking to merge his Brasil Ecodiesel Industria &
Comercio de Biocombustiveis & Oleos Vegetais SA with Vanguarda
do Brasil SA to create a biodiesel and crop producer with a
combined value of 2.16 billion reais ($1.4 billion).  Ecodiesel’s board is likely to make a decision on the
proposed merger within 60 days, the Sao Paulo-based company said
today in a regulatory filing. Vanguarda is valued at 1.2 billion
reais and Ecodiesel at about 964.9 million, according to the
statement. The Ecodiesel valuation is about 6 percent higher
than yesterday’s closing price in  Sao Paulo  trading.  Banuelos’s Veremonte Participacoes SA indirectly owns a
controlling stake in both Ecodiesel, a biodiesel producer, and a
50 percent stake in Vanguarda, a soybeans, cotton and corn
producer in  Brazil . Brazilian farmer Otaviano Pivetta, who is
Vanguarda’s controlling shareholder, plans to take a 32 percent
stake in the resulting company, according to the statement.  Banuelos amassed a fortune during the Spanish housing boom
after shares in his Astroc Mediterraneo SA construction company
surged. Vanguarda plants 230,000 hectares (568,300 acres) of
soybeans, corn and cotton in Brazil.  Brasil Ecodiesel shares rose 3.6 percent, or 3 centavos, at
87 centavos at 10:27 a.m. in Sao Paulo trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
