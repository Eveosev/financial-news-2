French rapeseed in the country’s
central growing region, which accounts for about a fifth of
national production, is lacking water,  France ’s technical center
for oilseed crops said.  Near the city of Tours in France’s Centre region, water
requirements of the rapeseed crop surpassed the available
moisture in the first 10 days of April, the Paris-based center,
known as Cetiom, said in a  report  on its website today.  Northern France has built up an “important” water-supply
deficit since the end of January, while maximum temperatures
have been at the “upper limit” of the normal range for the
season, the European Union’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources
unit said in a  report  dated April 12.  “The season is relatively early compared with other years
due to the high temperatures,” Cetiom said. “The dry
conditions persist and there’s no change announced for the
coming days. The soils therefore are dry.”  Rapeseed in the Centre and Ile-de-France regions and the
Eure department in Haute-Normandie has “mostly” entered the
growing stage in which plants start to drop their flower petals,
the center said.  The Centre region accounts for about 15 percent of France’s
rapeseed production, while the Ile-de-France region produces
another 4 percent of the country’s crop, according to  data  from
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  To contact the reporter on this story:
