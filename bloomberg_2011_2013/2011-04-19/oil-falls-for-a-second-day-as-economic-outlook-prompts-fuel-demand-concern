Oil increased for the fourth time
in five days as speculation that the  European Central Bank  will
further raise  interest rates  strengthened the euro against the
dollar, boosting commodities’ appeal as an alternate investment.  Oil rose 1 percent as the dollar tumbled a day after S&P
Ratings Service cut the nation’s long-term credit outlook to
negative. The Energy Department will probably report tomorrow
that U.S. oil supplies jumped for a seventh week. Crude and
equities fell yesterday on the ratings cut and after Saudi
Arabia said the market was oversupplied.  “We’re seeing a bit of a rebound on the weaker dollar and
a little bit of confidence because the stock market isn’t
falling apart and because of the ongoing risk in the Middle
East, which is still strong,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president
of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Crude oil for May delivery gained $1.03 to settle at
$108.15 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
have risen 33 percent in the past year. The May contract expired
at the close of Nymex floor trading. The more actively traded
June futures rose 59 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $108.28.  June prices were little changed from the settlement after
the  American Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S.
crude-oil stockpiles increased 667,000 barrels to 356.1 million.
June oil rose 64 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $108.33 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:33 p.m.  ’Fishing for Stops’  Prices extended their advance after the June contract broke
through $108 and $108.20 a barrel, said Carl Larry, president of
Oil Outlook & Opinions LLC in Houston.  The market is “just fishing for stops,” he said,
referring to standing orders to buy or sell when a specified
price is reached. Oil is volatile because of expiration and
since many traders are off for Passover or before Easter, he
said. “It’s weeks like this when people can go ahead and fish
for levels to trigger more buying and more selling.”  ECB governing council member Nout Wellink said in Toronto
late yesterday that the central bank’s April 7 interest-rate
increase sent an “extremely important” signal to investors
aimed at preventing expectations of higher inflation.  The dollar fell 0.8 percent to $1.4343 per euro at 3:25
p.m. in New York. It reached $1.452 in intraday trading on April
12 and April 13, the lowest levels since January 2010.  Standard & Poor’s  said yesterday that the U.S. government
may lose its AAA credit rating unless policy makers agree on a
plan to cut budget deficits and the national debt.  Equities Edge Up  U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said the
administration and Congress need to work together over the
“next couple months” to agree on a framework for cutting
budget deficits with “enforceable limits” on accumulating
debt. He told Bloomberg Television there is an emerging
consensus on “how much we have to do.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.6 percent to
1,312.62. The benchmark gauge for American equities dropped 1.1
percent yesterday, the most since March 16, on the S&P ratings
cut. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 65.16 points, or 0.5
percent, to 12,266.75.  The foreign minister of Bahrain, an island nation off the
eastern coast of  Saudi Arabia , said today that troops from
Persian Gulf countries will remain in Bahrain as a counter to
Iran. The country declared a three-month state of emergency
March 15 after troops from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states
arrived to help quell protests led by majority Shiite Muslims.  “They are there for a mission protecting our vital
institutions against foreign threat,” Sheikh Khalid Bin Ahmed
Al-Khalifa told reporters yesterday in Dubai. His remarks about
the troops staying were made in a posting on Twitter.  Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil exporter.  Reversing Early Decline  Earlier, oil tumbled 1.5 percent amid signals that prices
at their highest levels since 2008 may hurt fuel demand.  OPEC Secretary General Abdalla el-Badri said there is “no
shortage of oil anywhere in the world,” even after supply
curtailments in  Libya .  Iran ’s OPEC Governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi
said the group is unlikely to alter output targets when it meets
in June.  “The bears appear to have been checked after a big day
yesterday,” said  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover
Inc., an energy-advisory company in  New Canaan ,  Connecticut .
“If we get a big crude oil drop tomorrow that could give the
bears some leverage to move the market yet lower.”  U.S. oil inventories increased 1.3 million barrels in the
seven days ended April 15 from 359.3 million a week earlier,
according to the median of 13 analyst estimates before an Energy
Department report tomorrow.  Brent crude oil for June settlement slipped 28 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $121.33 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London .  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 517,320
contracts as of 4:38 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 574,331
contracts yesterday, 27 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.55 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
