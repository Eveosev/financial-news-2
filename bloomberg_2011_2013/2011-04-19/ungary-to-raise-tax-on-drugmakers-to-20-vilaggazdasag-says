Hungary plans to raise a special
tax on drugmakers to 20 percent from 12 percent,  Vilaggazdasag 
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said last week the levy
would be increased to 18 percent from next year, the newspaper
reported.  The higher tax is needed to cover gaps in the drug budget,
Vilaggazdasag said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
