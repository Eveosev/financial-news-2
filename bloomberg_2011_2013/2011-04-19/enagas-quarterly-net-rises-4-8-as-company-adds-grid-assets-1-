Enagas SA, the operator of  Spain ’s
natural-gas grid, said first-quarter profit rose 4.8 percent as
it added network assets.  Net income increased to 86 million euros ($123 million)
from 82 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based company
said today in a regulatory filing. Sales from regulated
operations rose 4.2 percent to 242 million euros.  Enagas, which earns a fixed return on investments, has
purchased assets and invested in expanding its network. Chief
Executive Officer Antonio Llarden forecasts net income will rise
at an average annual pace of at least 7 percent from 2009
through 2014.  The company aims to increase profit by about 5 percent this
year. It plans to invest 650 million euros in 2011 and forecasts
it will start operating 650 million euros of assets.  Enagas (ENG) 
invested 130 million euros in the first quarter and started
operating 165 million euros of assets.  Enagas plans to put 3.4 billion euros of assets in
operation through 2014, or an average of 680 million euros a
year, more than the average of 550 million euros in 2007 through
2009, the company said on July 20. It will invest 700 million
euros a year on average through 2014.  Net debt climbed to 3.18 billion euros at the end of March
from 3.02 billion euros a year earlier and the average cost of
debt increased to 2.76 percent from 2.72 percent a year earlier.  Besides pipelines, Enagas is also investing in liquefied
natural gas terminals and the El Musel regasification plant is
under construction. The company runs three of Spain’s six
regasification terminals that turn liquefied natural gas back
into gas. Spain is  Europe ’s biggest importer of LNG.  CEO Llarden on March 24 said the company forecasts domestic
natural gas demand this year will climb 1.5 percent. Spanish gas
demand fell 0.1 percent in 2010.  Enagas shares have climbed 5.5 percent in  Madrid  this year,
giving the company a market value of 3.76 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
