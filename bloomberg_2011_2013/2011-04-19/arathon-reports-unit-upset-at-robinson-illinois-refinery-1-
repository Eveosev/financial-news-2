Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  reported a unit
upset at its Robinson refinery in Illinois yesterday, according
to a  filing  with state regulators.  The upset was caused by an incorrect setting on a pressure
controller for a wet gas compressor at the fluid catalytic
cracker, according to the filing with the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency.  Shane Pochard, a spokesman for Marathon, declined to
comment.  The 215,000-barrel-a-day refinery, which is located in
southeastern Illinois, processes sweet and sour crudes,
according to a company filing. The plant delivers refined
products to terminals in Chicago via the Wabash pipeline system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
