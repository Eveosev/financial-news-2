(Corrects fourth paragraph of story published April 19 to
specify trade group’s volume total is for one week only and
excludes intermodal freight.)  CSX Corp. (CSX) , the third-biggest U.S.
railroad, said quarterly profit gained 30 percent as shipping
volumes rose because of the economic recovery.  Net income climbed to $395 million, or $1.06 a share, from
$305 million, or 78 cents, a year earlier, the Jacksonville,
Florida-based company said today in a statement. While that beat
the average of $1.04 of 28 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg, the shares slid 2 percent to $74.50 in late trading.  “Railroads through 2010 have been delivering results well
above Street expectations,”  Walter Spracklin , an RBC Capital
Markets analyst in Toronto who recommends holding CSX, said in a
telephone interview. “This I wouldn’t call blowing out the
lights. This is modestly better than expected.”  U.S. railroads moved 299,903 carloads excluding intermodal
cargo in the last week of the first quarter, 1.9 percent more
than a year earlier, according to the  Association of American
Railroads . CSX said volume increased 7 percent, and sales rose
13 percent to $2.81 billion.  Automotive shipping climbed 20 percent, the biggest gain
among CSX’s divisions. Coal shipments, which accounted for 31
percent of the company’s sales last year, advanced 3 percent.  CEO’s View  “We’re continuing to see, quarter after quarter, the
markets keep improving,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Ward
said in an interview at Bloomberg News’ New York headquarters on
April 6. He said at the time that volumes were “running 5 to 7
percent up” from a year earlier.  CSX fell $1.54 to $74.50 at 4:55 p.m. after regular New
York Stock Exchange trading following the earnings release. The
shares rose 69 cents earlier to push the gain for the year to 18
percent.  Operating costs rose 10 percent in the quarter, paced by a
42 percent jump in fuel spending, CSX said. The operating ratio,
a measure of expenses divided by sales, was 72.5 percent, down
210 basis points from a year earlier, CSX said.  CSX reiterated its operating-ratio forecast, saying it will
achieve a “high-60s” percentage this year. CSX has predicted
it will reduce that ratio to 65 percent by 2015.  Union Pacific Corp. (UNP) , the largest U.S. railroad by sales,
will report earnings tomorrow at 1 p.m. New York time.
Burlington Northern  Santa Fe , which is owned by  Warren Buffett ’s
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc ., is the second-biggest U.S. railroad by
2010 revenue.  (CSX will hold a call for investors at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow
at +1-888-327-6279.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
