Novartis AG (NOVN)  withdrew its
application to market the Joicela pain pill in the European
Union because the Swiss company wasn’t able to provide
information to regulators in the time allowed.  Joicela was intended to be used to relieve pain in patients
with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip who don’t carry a
specific genetic marker, the European Medicines Agency said in a
statement today. The withdrawal won’t bias the regulator against
a subsequent application for the product, the agency said.  The EU filing was the second attempt by Novartis,  Europe ’s
second-largest drugmaker by sales, at re-introducing the drug.
The Basel-based company planned to re-submit the treatment,
which belongs to a group of painkillers known as COX-2
inhibitors, to U.S. regulators in 2009 along with a genetic test
to detect patients prone to liver damage, Novartis said at the
time.  The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  said in September
2007 that it couldn’t approve the treatment, also known as
lumiracoxib or Prexige, for patients suffering from
osteoarthritis because studies showed too high a rate of liver
damage. European regulators halted sales of the drug months
later.  The application withdrawal “has nothing to do with
biomarkers or genetic tests,”  Eric Althoff , a spokesman for
Novartis, said in a telephone interview. “COX-2s remain a
challenging environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
