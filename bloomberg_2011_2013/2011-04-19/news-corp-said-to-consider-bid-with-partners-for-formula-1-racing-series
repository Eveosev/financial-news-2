News Corp. (NWSA) , the media company
controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is considering a bid for the
Formula One race car series, according to a person with
knowledge the situation.  News Corp., owner of cable-television channels including
Speed, would only bid for Formula One with partners, said the
person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. The New York-
based company has held talks with people associated with Formula
One car manufacturers, and with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim,
Sky News reported earlier.  Formula One racing includes Grand Prix races in Monaco and
Bahrain. News Corp.’s interest is in the early stages and the
company has yet to contact Formula One’s owner, the London-based
private equity firm  CVC Capital Partners , the person said.  Julie Henderson , a spokeswoman for News Corp., declined to
comment, as did Arturo Elias, a spokesman for Slim.  News Corp. declined 11 cents to $16.87 in Nasdaq composite
trading today. The class A shares have gained 16 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
