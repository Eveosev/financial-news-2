Air Lease Corp., the jet-leasing
company led by Steven Udvar-Hazy, raised $802.5 million in the
industry’s largest U.S. initial public offering after increasing
the number of shares 21 percent.  The Los Angeles-based company sold 30.3 million shares at
$26.50 each yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It had offered 25 million shares at $25 to $28, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The underwriters may exercise an overallotment option to
buy as many as 4.54 million additional shares, Bloomberg data
show, compared with the 3.75 million listed in the prospectus.  Udvar-Hazy, 65, is drawing on four decades of relationships
with airlines, planemakers and bankers to recreate some of what
he walked away from in 2010 when he left  American International
Group Inc. (AIG)  As chairman and chief executive officer of Air Lease,
he has built a fleet of 49 aircraft, with orders for more than
150 additional planes since founding the company 14 months ago.  Air Lease’s fleet doesn’t have the “legacy challenges”
that saddle competitors, Udvar-Hazy said in a presentation
broadcast online by RetailRoadshow. The company’s jets have a
weighted average age of 3.5 years, compared with 5.4 years for
competitor AerCap Holding NV’s 350 planes, 8.1 years for  Fly
Leasing Ltd. (FLY) ’s 59 and 11 years for  Aircastle Ltd. (AYR) ’s 136
aircraft, according to company filings.  Air Lease doesn’t plan to pay a dividend, according to its
prospectus, while Aircastle and Fly do.  Industry Growth  Aircraft leasing is growing in popularity as airlines seek
flexibility within the cyclical air-travel industry as well as a
way to avoid burdening their balance sheets with the billions of
dollars required to fund plane purchases. In 1990, about 10
percent of the world’s commercial planes were leased, and by
2015 that proportion will reach 35 percent, according to
estimates by industry-data providers Ascend and Avitas cited by
Air Lease.  Still, the three aircraft lessors that went public in the
two years before the recession hit -- AerCap, Aircastle and Fly
-- all were trading at least 37 percent below their $23 initial
share price as of April 15.  The shares, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol AL, climbed $1.03, or 3.9 percent, to $27.53, at
10:03 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse AG, Barclays Plc, FBR
Capital Markets,  RBC Capital Markets  and  Wells Fargo & Co . led
the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
