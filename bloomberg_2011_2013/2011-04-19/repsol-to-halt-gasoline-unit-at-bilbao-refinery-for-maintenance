Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Spain ’s biggest oil
company, will halt a platformer at its Petronor refinery in
Bilbao for maintenance.  The refinery “is proceeding with the shutdown of the
platforming unit P2,” Petronor said today in a statement on its
website. “The process may produce intermittent flaring.”  The unit will be restarted within a month, according to the
statement. Platformers make high-octane blending components for
gasoline.  The refinery has the capacity to process 220,000 barrels of
crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Flaring is
a safety measure to prevent excessive pressure from building in
processing units that are being shut or started.  To contact the reporters on this story:
