BP Plc (BP/) , whose stock lost a third
since the biggest U.S. oil spill, will get Brazil’s approval to
buy Devon Energy Corp.’s assets in the country shortly, a
government official said.  The Brazilian oil regulator has authorized BP to operate in
the country and there should be “no problem” approving the
$3.2 billion purchase of Devon’s exploration blocks, including
areas in deep waters of the Campos Basin, Magda Chambriard, a
director at the agency, told reporters in  Rio de Janeiro  today.  BP has signed exploration agreements in Australia, Russia
and India this year as it expands in emerging markets. Brazil is
a “critical” country for BP because U.S. exploration has
slowed after the spill at the offshore Macondo well last year,
said  Gianna Bern , president of Brookshire Advisory and Research,
a Chicago-based adviser to oil producers.  “Reducing exposure to the U.S.  Gulf of Mexico  is going to
be increasingly important to BP,” said Bern in a telephone
interview. “The permitting process is going to be very slow in
the Gulf of Mexico.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
