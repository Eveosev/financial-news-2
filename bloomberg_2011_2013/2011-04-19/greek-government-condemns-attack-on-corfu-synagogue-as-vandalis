The Greek government said it
condemned as an act of vandalism an attack today on a synagogue
on the island of Corfu.  “The break-in and the destruction of ceremonial books in
the Jewish Synagogue of Corfu is an immoral and appalling act”
spokesman  George Petalotis  said in an e-mailed statement from
the Athens-based press ministry today. “Anti-Semitism is
incompatible with Greek culture.”  An unknown group broke into the synagogue early this
morning and set religious books on fire, according to a
statement by the Greek police today. Police said they are
investigating the incident, according to the  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
