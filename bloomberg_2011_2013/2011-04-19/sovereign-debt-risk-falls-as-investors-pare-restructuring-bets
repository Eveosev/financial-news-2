The cost of insuring Greek
sovereign debt rose to a record as speculation increased the
nation will be forced to restructure its debt.  Credit-default swaps on  Greece  rose 7 basis points to
1,260, surpassing yesterday’s record closing level, according to
CMA.  Comments by unnamed officials that a restructuring is
inevitable hold no validity, Greece’s government spokesman
 George Petalotis  said today.  Standard & Poor’s  decision
yesterday to assign a “negative” outlook to the AAA credit
rating of the U.S. also weighed on sentiment.  “We still think a default/restructuring is the most likely
outcome for Greece, but it’s a question of timing,” said
Harpreet Parhar, a strategist at Credit Agricole SA in London.
“The story, though denied by the government, is gaining
traction.”  Swaps on other European governments fell for the first time
in more than a week. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index
of credit-default swaps on 15 governments declined 0.5 basis
point to 189, after climbing to the highest since January
yesterday. Contracts on  Portugal  dropped from a record, falling
3 basis points to 618.  Ireland decreased 4 basis points to 603, Italy fell 5 to
155 and  Spain  was 5.5 lower at 249.5. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Financial Index  The cost of insuring against losses on European bank bonds
also fell. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the
senior debt of 25 banks and insurers decreased 2 basis points to
137, and the subordinated index was down 2.5 at 240.5, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 6 basis points to 376. The
Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings fell 0.5 to 101.25.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
