Greek note yields reached euro-era
records amid growing speculation the country will need to
restructure its debt as financing costs mount.  German debt slid as data showed European services and
manufacturing growth unexpectedly accelerated in April,
bolstering the case for higher  interest rates .  Greece  sold 1.625
billion euros ($2.3 billion) of 13-week bills at a higher
interest rate amid lower demand than the previous auction of
similar debt. Greek two-year note yields breached 20 percent for
the first time yesterday. Portuguese two-year yields rose to the
highest in at least 15 years today.  “The fact that Greece was able to overcome this particular
hurdle will provide some relief,” said  Orlando Green , assistant
director of capital-markets strategy at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “There’s still a concern
over liquidity. There hasn’t been a shift to positive sentiment,
and they’re not out of the woods yet.”  Greek two-year yields rose 29 basis points to 20.62
percent, after touching 20.67 percent, the highest since at
least 1998, when Bloomberg began collecting the data. The 4.6
percent security due 2013 fell 0.22, or 2.2 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 75.03 as of 4:16 p.m. in  London . The Greek 10-
year yield fell seven basis points to 14.48 percent after rising
as high as 14.66 percent, a euro-era record, before the auction.  Wider Spread  Today’s Greek sale was priced at a yield of 4.10 percent,
up from 3.85 percent at an auction of similar debt on Feb. 15.
Investors bid for 3.45 times the amount of securities offered,
down from the previous bid-to-cover ratio of 5.08.  The yield difference, or spread, between the nation’s 10-
year bonds and German securities of a similar maturity, earlier
reached 1,138 basis points. That’s the most since at least 1998.  Portugal ’s two-year note declined for a fifth consecutive
day, pushing the yield to 10.26 percent, the highest since at
least 1996.  Greek government spokesman  George Petalotis  today
“categorically” denied reports in newspapers that said Greece
has asked to extend maturities of the country’s debt.  The cost of insuring Greek government debt increased seven
basis points to 1,260 basis points, surpassing yesterday’s
record closing level, according to CMA prices for credit default
swaps. Contracts on Portugal dropped from a record, falling
three basis points to 618.  More Problems  German bunds fell for the first time in six days. A
composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing industries rose to 57.8
in April from 57.6 in March, London-based Markit Economics said
today. Economists had projected a drop to 57. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  The 10-year bund yield was three basis points higher at
3.28 percent, after reaching 3.225 percent, the lowest since
March 24. Yields on two-year notes were six basis points higher
at 1.79 percent. They earlier touched 1.716 percent, the lowest
since March 25.  European Central Bank Executive Board member Juergen Stark
said any country seeking to renegotiate its debt obligations
would find it creates more problems than it solves.  “It might be perceived at some point by some policy makers
as an easy way out, but it would not solve the problem,” Stark
said, according to an interview published today. “On the
contrary. It is extremely costly to the respective countries. If
they really considered restructuring debt, they would have to
pay in the future a higher  risk premium .”  Rate Outlook  Some ECB governing council members have signaled they favor
raising rates further after increasing the benchmark rate 25
basis points to 1.25 percent on April 7. Policy makers are
balancing the need for higher borrowing costs in countries like
 Germany , where the economy is booming, against soaring bond
yields in the region’s heavily indebted nations.  Germany plans to auction 6 billion euros in new five-year
2.75 percent notes tomorrow, while  Spain  is due to sell up to
3.5 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2021 and 2024.  The yield difference between Spain’s 10-year bonds and
similar-maturity German bunds narrowed to 223 basis points after
reaching 232 basis points earlier, the most since Jan. 28.  “With Spanish yields close to the highest levels we’ve
seen over the past months, there should be enough concession for
the auction,” said Norbert Aul, a strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in London. “There is still a clear risk scenario with
respect to the recent underperformance of Spanish paper as well,
given the fact that this auction is before the Easter break.”  Spanish 10-year bond yields fell four basis points to 5.51
percent. They reached 5.60 percent yesterday, the highest since
Jan. 11. Two-year yields slipped five basis points to 3.52
percent, after earlier rising to 3.64 percent, also the most
since Jan. 11.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 1.8
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Treasuries have returned 0.6 percent. Greek debt has lost 7.4
percent, the indexes show, while Spain’s has gained 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
