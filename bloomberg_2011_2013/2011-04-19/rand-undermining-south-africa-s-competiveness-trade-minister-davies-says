South African Trade and Industry
Minister Rob Davies said the strength of the rand is undermining
the nation’s competitiveness and that the government needs to
decide whether to act on the issue.  “There is a consensus that at this level where the rand is
now, the rand is uncompetitive and is having a detrimental
effect, not only on exporters but also on local producers who
are suffering unfair competition from imports,” Davies told
reporters in  Cape Town  today. “There is a huge debate in  South
Africa  about whether we should try some new things or not. We
have to work on this particular issue.”  The rand has gained 39 percent against the dollar since the
beginning of 2009, as near-zero  interest rates  in developed
nations encouraged investors to borrow cheaply and invest in
higher-yielding markets including South Africa, where the
benchmark rate is 5.5 percent.  The rand traded at 6.8291 at 1:46 p.m. in Johannesburg, up
from 6.8643 late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
