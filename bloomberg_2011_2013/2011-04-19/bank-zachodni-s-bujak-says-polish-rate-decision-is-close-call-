Piotr Bujak, an economist at Bank
Zachodni WBK in Warsaw, comments on Polish industrial output and
production price data, released today in Warsaw.  Industrial output rose an annual 7 percent in March, the
slowest since October 2009 and below the median estimate of 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg for an increase of 9.6 percent.
Producer prices increased by percent from the year-earlier
period, compared with a median estimate of 8.3 percent.  “This is a pretty significant slowdown -- and we’ll have
to expect further weakening in the output figures as the
economies of our main trading partners slow. German growth is
likely to be weaker, for example, which will hurt our exports.  “The disappointing output figures will be an argument for
Monetary Policy Council members who want to wait with the next
rate increase.  “On the other hand, PPI was very strong, which could raise
fears this will transfer to retail prices. The price pressures
are an argument for the hawks in the central bank.  “The May rate-setting meeting could be a very close call.
I don’t expect a rate hike next month, though. The central bank
won’t want to give the impression that it’s just reacting to
current data.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
