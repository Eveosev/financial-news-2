Farkhad Akhmedov raised the price
he wants for his 49 percent in ZAO Northgas to $1.8 billion
after getting a higher valuation from bankers and an audit of
the Russian gas producer’s reserves, Vedomosti said today,
citing a letter from the businessman to the potential buyer, OAO
Inter RAO UES.  Inter RAO, a state-run power utility, had agreed to buy the
stake for about $1.5 billion under a non-binding agreement,
Vedomosti said, citing the businessman. Akhmedov may use the
extra $300 million to buy Inter RAO stock, the newspaper said.  OAO Gazprom, which owns the majority stake in Northgas,
didn’t exercise its right of first refusal to Akhmedov’s stake
by an April 12 deadline, the newspaper said, citing two
unidentified people with knowledge of the transaction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
