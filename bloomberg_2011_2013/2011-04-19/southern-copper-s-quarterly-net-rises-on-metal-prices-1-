(Corrects timeframe in first paragraph.)  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , the largest
producer of the metal in Peru and Mexico, said first-quarter
profit rose 25 percent on rising copper prices and output.  Net income climbed to $478.4 million, or 56 cents a share,
from $383.2 million, or 45 cents, in the year-earlier period,
the Phoenix-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
Profit, excluding items, was expected to be about 82 cents a
share, the average estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Sales increased 31 percent to $1.6 billion as New York-
traded copper futures averaged 33 percent higher in the quarter
than a year earlier. Average silver prices rose 89 percent.
Southern also benefited from the restart of its Cananea copper
mine in  Mexico , which ended a three-year strike in June 2009.  Southern Copper  fell 9 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $35.67 at
1:21 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has gained 9.4 percent in the past year.  (Southern Copper will hold a conference call today at 11
a.m. New York time. Dial-in: 1-631-813-4732, Conference ID:
