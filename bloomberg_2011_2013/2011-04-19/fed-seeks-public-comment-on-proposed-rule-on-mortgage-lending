The Federal Reserve today requested
public comment on a proposed rule that would require lenders to
determine a consumerâ€™s ability to repay a mortgage before making
the loan.  The rule would also establish minimum mortgage underwriting
standards, the central bank said in a statement in  Washington 
today. The Fed said it will accept comments until July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
