The British Olympic Association and
the organizers of the 2012 London Games settled a dispute over
funding of the national teams that was headed for arbitration.  The BOA and the local organizing committee ended their
disagreement after several days of negotiations, they said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Under the terms, the local organizing committee, once it
has a “sufficient surplus,” will share funds with the BOA and
the British Paralympic Association after the event, while
distributing 60 percent of a surplus for the benefit of sport in
the U.K., 20 percent to the  International Olympic Committee  and
20 percent to the BOA, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
