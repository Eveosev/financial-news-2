Ecolab Inc. (ECL) ’s bearish options
trading rose to a record and was more than 538 times the four-
week average after a single transaction before the maker of
cleaning chemicals for restaurants reports results April 26.  Almost 39,400 puts to sell the stock changed hands as of
3:35 p.m. in New York, compared with 150 calls to buy. An
investor bought 19,000 May $50 puts while selling the same
number of May $45 puts in a strategy known as a put spread,
which cuts the cost of the trade by capping potential gains. The
shares rose 1.3 percent to $51.39.  “The investors are likely concerned about raw-material
cost pressure into earnings,” according to a report from
Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP. “To put this trade in
perspective, this investor would be able to sell 1.9 million
shares if share prices fell between $50 and $45 heading into May
expiration, which represents over 0.8 percent of shares
outstanding.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
