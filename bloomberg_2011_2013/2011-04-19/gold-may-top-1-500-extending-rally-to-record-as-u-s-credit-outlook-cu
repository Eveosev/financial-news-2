Gold extended gains to a record in
 New York  as a drop in the dollar buoyed demand for the metal as
an alternative investment.  Futures surged yesterday after  Standard & Poor’s  revised
its U.S. credit outlook to negative. Gold has jumped 5.3 percent
this year as the dollar dropped 4.8 percent against a basket of
six other currencies including the euro and British pound.  Gold prices may keep rising for “some years into the
future,”  Blackrock Inc. (BLK)  fund manager  Evy Hambro  said in an
interview with  Mark Barton  on Bloomberg TV’s “On the Move.”  Gold for June delivery rose $1.60, or 0.1 percent, to
$1,494.60 an ounce by 8:20 a.m. in New York after earlier today
climbing to $1,498.90. Immediate-delivery gold was little
changed at $1,493.93 an ounce in  London .  The 14-day relative strength index of gold futures rose to
70.135, above the level of 70 that some analysts who study
charts view as a sign that prices are poised to drop.  “$1,500 is definitely a psychological level,” said Mark
O’Byrne, executive director of brokerage GoldCore Ltd. in
Dublin. “Any correction is likely to be short and shallow,
given the very strong fundamentals.”  At current prices, gold is still $900 below the inflation-
adjusted level, GoldCore’s O’Byrne said, adding that gold may
reach as much as $2,400 in the coming years.  ‘Debt Issue’  “The focus has moved to the U.S. sovereign debt issue,”
O’Byrne said. “There are very significant risks in the world,
that’s why people are diversifying into gold. Before, the  U.S.
government debt  was meant to be risk free. Now that is in
question.”  Gold has gained in the last 10 years on increased
investment demand for commodities and on concern that currencies
may be debased as central banks stimulate their economies.
Unrest in the Middle East, sovereign-debt turmoil in  Europe  and
Japan’s nuclear crisis have bolstered sales, propelling bullion
32 percent higher in the past year.  Additional support for gold came from quickening inflation
that has prompted policy makers across the globe to raise
 interest rates . Consumer prices in  China  rose at their quickest
pace since 2008 in March, exceeding the government’s 2011 target
for a third month.  Inflation ‘Impetus’  Inflation in the 17-nation euro region quickened to 2.7
percent from 2.4 percent in February, the European Union’s
statistics office said last week. U.S. wholesale costs rose 5.8
percent in March compared with a year earlier, and the
government said that the cost of living rose for a ninth month.  “Growing fears of rising inflation and a weak dollar
continue to benefit gold and silver,” Marc Ground, an analyst
at  Standard Bank , wrote in a note. “Inflation-hedge buying is
providing the main impetus.”  Gold held in exchange-traded products rose 0.36 metric tons
to 2,070.32 tons yesterday, the highest level since Jan. 24,
data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show.  Silver for May delivery gained 0.7 percent to $43.275 an
ounce. Palladium for June delivery was up 0.7 percent at $744.35
an ounce and platinum for July delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1,788.70 an ounce.  -- With assistance from Chanyaporn Chanjaroen in Singapore.
