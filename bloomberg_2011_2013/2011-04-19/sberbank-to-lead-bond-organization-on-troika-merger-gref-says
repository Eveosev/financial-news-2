OAO Sberbank Chief Executive
Officer German Gref comments on the ruble rate and the Russian
lender’s integration with Troika Dialog after it bought the
broker in March. Gref gave an interview in Moscow on April 15.  On acquisition of Troika:  “Obviously there have been some issues, nothing major, but
we can’t be expected to have foreseen every little issue. In
general, I would say that everything is going according to plan.
The main thing is that we didn’t make an error with the quality
of assets, of the human capital. I think our understanding of
each other has improved further. The main thing is that we are
very close in our philosophy and values, which is very
important. We have virtually no disagreements. You rarely see
such deals.”  On Sberbank as organizer of ruble bond sales after merger:  “I think we shall become the absolute leader on this
market. Both of us have very decent DCM teams and uniting their
efforts and spirits I think will eventually yield a very good
result.”  On ruble bonds versus dollar debt:  “You know the ruble’s appreciation trend is always under a
question mark. No one can say whether it will be a long-term
trend. Everything depends on the oil price. Though it’s also an
interesting time to raise funds in foreign currencies, including
the dollar. The rates are interesting, the ruble rates are very
interesting. Foreign currency rates are extremely low if you
start hedging.”
