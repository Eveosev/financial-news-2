Hoover, the vacuum cleaner maker,
is pulling advertising from ABC to protest the TV network’s
decision to cancel the soap operas “All My Children” and “One
Life to Live,” the Associated Press reported.  The action was taken after the wife and mother of Hoover
marketing executive Brian Kirkendall became upset about the
cancellation of the TV programs, AP reported, citing an
interview with him. A posting by Kirkendall on the company’s
Facebook page spurred messages of support, according to AP.  The company, controlled by  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , had
purchased time for six ads to air on the network this week,
according to AP. ABC is owned by  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
