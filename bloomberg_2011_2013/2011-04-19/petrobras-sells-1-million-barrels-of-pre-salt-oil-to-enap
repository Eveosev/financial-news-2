Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, will export its first cargo from
the country’s second-largest crude field to Chile in mid-May.  Petrobras agreed to sell 1 million barrels of oil from the
offshore Lula field in the so-called pre-salt area to Chile’s
Empresa Nacional de Petroleo, or Enap, the Rio de Janeiro-based
producer said today in an e-mailed statement.  Petrobras aims to double production by 2020 as it develops
Lula and other deepwater oil discoveries lying two miles below
the ocean surface and another two to four miles beneath the
seabed. The field, with recoverable reserves of 6.5 billion
barrels, trails the Brazilian government’s nearby Libra field
that may hold as much as 15 billion barrels.  “The company has a lot of potential to become a major
world exporter,” said Max Bueno, an analyst at Spinelli in  Sao
Paulo . Demand growth in Brazil’s domestic market is unlikely to
outpace production increases, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
