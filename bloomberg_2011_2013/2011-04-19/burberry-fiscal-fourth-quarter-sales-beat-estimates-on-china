Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) , the U.K.’s
largest luxury retailer, reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales
that beat analysts’ estimates and confirmed that adjusted full-
year profit will be near the top end of market expectations.  Excluding Spain, revenue in the quarter ended March 31 rose
32 percent to 390 million pounds ($633 million) from 295 million
pounds a year earlier, the London-based company said today in a
statement. The average estimate of three analysts compiled by
Bloomberg was for sales of 351.3 million pounds.  “While the luxury industry faces global challenges in the
year ahead, we remain confident in our team’s ability to
outperform,” Chief Executive Officer Angela Ahrendts said in
the statement.  Burberry said in January that full-year adjusted pretax
profit would be near the top end of a forecast of between 250
million pounds and 290 million pounds. The quarterly revenue
growth was driven by retail sales in  China , the trench-coat
maker said today.  “Another quarter of industry outperformance,”  Thomas Chauvet , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote in an
April 14 note. He has a “hold” recommendation on Burberry.  Burberry closed a warehouse and stopped making a local
collection in Spain last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
