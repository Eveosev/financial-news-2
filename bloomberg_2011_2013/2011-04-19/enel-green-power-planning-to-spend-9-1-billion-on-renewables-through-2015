Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , a unit of
Italy’s biggest utility, will spend 6.4 billion euros ($9.1
billion) through 2015 on power plants using wind, sun and other
renewable sources, the chief executive officer said.  Part of the funding will go to building a factory to make
solar-energy panels in Catania on the Italian island of Sicily,
Enel Green Power CEO Francesco Starace said at a conference in
Dubai today.  Italy’s state-controlled utility  Enel SpA (ENEL)  sold shares and
listed Enel Green Power on the Milan Stock Exchange in November.
The company, which operates wind, solar, thermal and hydro-
electric plants, is expanding in Europe and the Americas.  Enel Green Power has earmarked about 1 billion euros for
spending on solar plants and the panel factory, Starace said.
The first phase of the Catania project will cost 300 million
euros, and the possible expansion of the facility may bring the
total expense to 800 million euros, he said.  The company aims to expand production in  Italy , Spain,
France, Greece, Turkey, Romania, Starace said. Enel Green Power
may expand to North Africa and the Middle East after 2015, he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
