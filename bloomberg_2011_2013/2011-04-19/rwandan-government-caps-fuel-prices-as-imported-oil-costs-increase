Rwanda capped prices for premium
gasoline and diesel fuel at 1,060 Rwandan francs ($1.76) per
liter, after a more than 12 percent increase in the cost of
imported oil over the past month and a half, according to an e-
mailed statement released by the government today.  Prices at the pump have risen 14 percent during the year to
date due to political instability in the Middle East, Trade and
Industry Minister Monique Nsanzabaganwa said at a meeting in the
capital, Kigali, on April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
