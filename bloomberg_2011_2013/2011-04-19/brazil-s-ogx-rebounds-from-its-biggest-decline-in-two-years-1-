OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes
SA, the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista ,
advanced today in Sao Paulo on speculation that yesterday’s 17
percent plunge was overdone.  OGX gained 4.8 percent to 17.05 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most since March
22. Yesterday’s losses, which wiped out $6.9 billion in market
value and were the biggest in two years, followed a report
showing the company’s oil reserves trailed estimates.  “The market overshot on OGX,” Max Bueno, an analyst at
Spinelli SA in Sao Paulo, said in an interview. “The report
takes into account the data collected through 2010. It doesn’t
take into account the production tests carried out this year.”  The company reported April 15 it had contingent resources
of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent and prospective resources
of 6.5 billion barrels. Deutsche Bank AG, Banco BTG Pactual SA,
Banco Santander SA and Citigroup Inc. each cut their
recommendations on OGX to “hold” from “buy” yesterday.  BTG analysts led by Gustavo Gattass said in a note to
clients they expected OGX to report contingent resources of
about 4 billion barrels. Merrill Lynch analysts led by Frank McGann said the estimate came in “at the low end” of their
expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
