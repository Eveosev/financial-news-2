Nigeria ’s Eurobonds rose to a
record and the nation’s stocks climbed on speculation the
election of incumbent Goodluck Jonathan as president will help
protect oil production in  Africa ’s biggest producer of the
commodity.  Nigeria’s dollar bonds due 2021 added 0.6 percent to
103.450 cents on the dollar as of 5:19 p.m. in London, the
highest level since the debt was issued in January, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield fell eight basis points to
6.27 percent. The $500 million of bonds are Nigeria’s only
international notes. The nation’s All-Share Index added 0.3
percent to 25,384.10 by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, according
to a statement on the bourse’s website, the longest winning
streak since Jan. 6.  Jonathan, 53, a Christian from the oil-rich Niger River
delta region, won 22.5 million, or 57 percent, of the votes
cast, compared with 12.2 million, or 31 percent, for former
military ruler  Muhammadu Buhari , 68, a northern Muslim, the
electoral commission said. Violent protests in the north of the
country killed at least six in Africa’s most populous nation
with 150 million residents, roughly split between a mostly
Muslim north and a largely Christian south, a divide reflected
in voting for the April 16 election.  “Investors are taking a measured view of the risk; the key
is that given Jonathan’s victory oil output is unlikely to be
under any threat,”  Razia Khan , London-based head of Africa
research at Standard Chartered Bank Plc, said in a phone
interview today. “The protests were in the north and of course
the oil comes from the delta and the delta is firmly in support
of Jonathan.”  Jonathan has promised to continue an amnesty for former
militants in the Niger River delta in the south of the nation, a
policy that has helped boost oil output there by 27 percent
since July 2009. Attacks by rebels in the region cut Nigeria’s
oil output by more than 28 percent between 2006 and 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
