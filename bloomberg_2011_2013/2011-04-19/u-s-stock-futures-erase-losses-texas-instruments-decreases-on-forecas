U.S. stock futures pared their
losses as investors awaited a report that may show housing

2.3 percent in early New York trading. Exxon Mobil Corp. and
ConocoPhillips declined in  Germany  as crude oil retreated for a
second day.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in June rose
less than 0.1 percent to 1,301.2 at 10:58 a.m. in  London , after
the benchmark gauge dropped 1.1 percent yesterday. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures climbed 0.1 percent to 12,148 today,
while Nasdaq-100 Index futures advanced less than 0.1 percent to
2,290.75.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
