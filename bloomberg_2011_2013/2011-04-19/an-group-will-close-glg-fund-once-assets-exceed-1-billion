Man Group Plc (EMG) , the world’s biggest
publicly traded hedge fund, plans to close its GLG Market
Neutral Fund to new investors after concluding producing good
returns will be easier if assets are capped at about $1 billion.  GLG portfolio manager Steve Roth decided that limiting the
size of the fund will make it easier to get in and out of
trading positions, Man Group spokesman David Waller said today.
The market neutral fund invests in convertible-arbitrage
strategies, which involves purchasing bonds that can be swapped
for equity when shares of an issuer reach a preset level.  Hedge fund managers and investors have become increasingly
focused on size since 2008, when industry losses and a global
credit crunch triggered a rush by clients to withdraw money.
Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP last year closed its $25
billion master fund and  Paul Jones ’s Tudor Investment Corp.
restricted investments into its $9.5 billion BVI Global Fund.  GLG suspended client redemptions from the market neutral
fund in 2008. The fund’s investment performance was down 54
percent that year and assets under management fell from a peak
of about $3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Market Neutral fund has since rebounded, gaining 82
percent in 2009 and 34 percent last year. The fund oversaw about
$920 million at the end of February, the data show. London-based
Man Group acquired GLG last year.  The decision to close the fund was reported earlier today
by the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
