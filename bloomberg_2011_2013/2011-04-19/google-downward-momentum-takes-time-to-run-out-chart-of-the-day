The slide in  Google Inc. (GOOG)  that began
after it reported first-quarter earnings may not end until the
middle of next month, if history is any guide.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the average decline in Google’s
shares starting two days after a profit report is 8.2 percent
over 30 days, and it’s another 44 days before it climbs back to
the old level, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
Birinyi Associates Inc. Birinyi tracked instances when Google
fell the day after releasing results.  “Buying right after that initial fall, at least
historically, hasn’t been the best entry point,” said Kevin
Pleines, an analyst at Birinyi, who conducted the study. “When
the market reacts negatively to its earnings, it generally
continues down a bit.”  Google’s price-to-earnings ratio has averaged 45.9 since
its initial public offering in August 2004, compared with 16.6
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The owner of the most-used Internet search engine fell 8.3
percent on April 15, the first session after Google posted
earnings that missed the average analyst estimate on the biggest
jump in operating expenses in three years.  Google’s stock declined 0.7 percent to $526.84 yesterday in
 New York . The shares would fall to about $487 next month,
according to Birinyi’s average. The analysis was based on the
average of 10 periods when the stock fell after earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
