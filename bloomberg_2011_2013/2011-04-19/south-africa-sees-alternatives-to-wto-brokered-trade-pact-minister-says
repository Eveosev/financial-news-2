South Africa  sees “alternatives”
to a World Trade Organisation-brokered global trade accord as
the demands of developed nations have become “unreasonable,”
according to Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies.  “The demands of the big players are dominating the process
and it’s led to demands which are frankly not sustainable” and
which are “unreasonable,” he told lawmakers in  Cape Town 
today. “A lot of people are saying the multilateral system will
be in danger. We now have alternatives.”  South Africa, which recently joined the BRIC group of
nations, is now able to build trade relations amongst other
developing countries, Davies said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
