German stocks rose, rebounding from
the biggest drop in a month, as carmakers gained and a report
showed European services and manufacturing growth unexpectedly
accelerated in April.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s second-biggest maker of luxury
cars, advanced 0.9 percent after saying its Mercedes-Benz unit
plans to double Chinese sales by 2015.  SAP AG (SAP)  climbed as Morgan
Stanley recommended the stock.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  rose 0.2 percent to 7,039.31 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt. The measure retreated 2.1 percent
yesterday as  Standard & Poor’s  revised its outlook for the long-
term sovereign credit rating of the U.S. to negative from stable
and concern mounted that  Greece  will need to restructure its
debt. The broader  HDAX Index (HDAX)  also gained 0.2 percent today.  “You can buy large-cap quality names at a reasonable price
at the moment,” Hans van de Weg, who manages about 270 million
euros ($386 million) for ING NV, said at a press conference in
 Frankfurt  today. “People have gradually started to move to
equities. At the moment, I don’t have big positions in
peripheral  Europe .”  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing rose to 57.8 this month
from 57.6 in March, London-based Markit Economics said today.
Economists had projected a drop to 57, the median of 13
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Greek Bonds  Greece sold 1.625 billion euros of 13-week Treasury bills
today. Greece’s two-year bond yield exceeded 20 percent for a
second day, even as officials denied the nation was preparing a
restructuring.  Daimler added 0.9 percent to 49.08 euros. Mercedes-Benz
plans to double  China  sales to 300,000 vehicles by 2015, Klaus Maier, president and chief executive officer of the division’s
business in China, said at the Shanghai Auto Show.  Auto shares had the best performance among 19 industry
groups in the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index today, rising 1.7
percent.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  surged 2.8 percent to 58.79
euros, while  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest carmaker, climbed
1.5 percent to 113 euros.  “We have a positive sentiment for German carmakers
today,” said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, an equity strategist at
Deutsche Postbank AG in Bonn. “China is one of the most
important markets for carmakers. However, I expect a calm
earnings season and I expect the economy to grow at a more
limited pace.”  MAN Gains  MAN SE added 1.5 percent to 88.87 euros. Europe’s third-
biggest truckmaker will start producing trucks in China this
year with partner Sinotruk Hong Kong Ltd. as it vies with
Daimler and Volvo AB.  Leoni AG surged 6.4 percent to 32.99 euros, the largest
advance in more than seven months.  Germany ’s biggest maker of
electrical cables for cars raised its full-year forecast for
earnings before interest and taxes to about 210 million euros.  SAP, the world’s largest maker of business-management
software, gained 1.1 percent to 44.27 euros. Morgan Stanley
raised the shares to “overweight” from “equal weight,”
saying “the acceleration SAP saw in its core business in the
fourth quarter of 2010 is sustainable.”  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH)  surged 2.2 percent to 159.10 euros, ending
the longest falling streak since August, as Credit Suisse raised
its recommendation on the chemicals maker to “outperform” from
“neutral.”  Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI)  climbed 2.6 percent to 10.33 euros as
BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research upgraded shares of the
residential landlord to “neutral” from “underperform.”  Vossloh AG (VOS)  dropped 1.2 percent to 94.06 euros as
Commerzbank AG cut its recommendation on the railroad-equipment
maker to “hold” from “add.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
