The Philippine peso fell to a two-
week low and bonds dropped as investors shunned emerging-market
assets after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. rating outlook.  The currency dropped to its lowest level in two weeks after
the ratings company said the world’s largest economy risks
losing its AAA credit rating unless policy makers agree on a
plan by 2013 to cut budget deficits and the national debt.  “It’s a knee-jerk reaction that pushes investors toward
safe-haven assets,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast
Pte in  Singapore . “The Philippines’ favorable fundamentals”
should limit the drop in the peso, she said.  The peso fell as much as 0.4 percent before closing 0.2
percent weaker at 43.323 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in Manila,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched 43.425, its weakest
level since April 5.  The  Philippines ’ international reserves climbed to a record
$66.2 billion in March and may reach $70 billion by the end of
the year, central bank Deputy Governor Nestor Espenilla said on
April 15. The S&P’s move should serve as a reminder to policy
makers around the region to diversify their reserves, Forecast’s
Rao said.  “More than 50 percent of reserves of Asian economies are
probably in U.S. Treasuries,” said Rao. The nation had a $2.02
billion surplus in the balance of payments in March, the most
since November, the central bank reported today.  The yield on the 9.125 percent bond due September 2016 rose
10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 5.20 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services. The Bureau of the
Treasury didn’t sell additional bills today, Deputy Treasurer
Eduardo Mendiola said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
