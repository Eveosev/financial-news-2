Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl (PMI) 
plans to raise as much as 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 million) by
selling new shares after the Bank of Italy asked the country’s
oldest cooperative bank to strengthen capital.  The Milan-based lender will ask shareholders at a meeting
in June to approve the plan, it said in a statement today.  Popolare di Milano joins other Italian lenders including
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Unione di banche Italiane SCPA, Banco
Popolare SC and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, that this
year asked investors for a total of 11.5 billion euros through
capital-raising plans.  Pop. Milano, which has to reimburse a 500 million-euro
government bond by 2013, received a letter from the  Bank of
Italy  asking it to reinforce its capital, two people familiar
with the situation said April 14. The central bank also
expressed concern about the lender’s governance because of the
presence of labor unions on the board, the people said.  The bank expects to have a core Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.8
percent in 2013 following the capital increase.  It also plans
to sell “non-strategic minority interests,” to further boost
capital, it said today.  Banca Akros SpA and Mediobanca SpA will manage the share
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
