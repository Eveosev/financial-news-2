Keppel Land Ltd. (KPLD) , the property
developer partly owned by the worldâ€™s biggest builder of oil
rigs, posted a 46 percent gain in first-quarter profit from a
year earlier because of higher home sales.  Net income for the three months ended on March 31 was
S$92.1 million ($73.9 million) compared with S$63.3 million a
year earlier, the Singapore-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. Revenue more than tripled to S$357.9 million
from S$106.5 million a year earlier.  Earnings from property trading increased 8.2 percent in the
quarter to S$51.6 million as the developer sold residential
projects in Singapore and Bangalore, Keppel Land said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
