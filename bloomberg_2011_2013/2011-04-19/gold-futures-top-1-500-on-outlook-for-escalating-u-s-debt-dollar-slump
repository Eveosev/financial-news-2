Gold futures rose to a record
$1,500.50 an ounce as  U.S. debt  concerns weighed on the dollar,
boosting demand for the precious metal as an alternative
investment. Silver surged to a 1980 high.  The greenback dropped against the euro on speculation that
the  European Central Bank  will continue to raise borrowing costs
as some nations struggle to contain sovereign debt. Standard &
Poor’s yesterday revised its long-term outlook on U.S. debt to
negative from stable. Gold has climbed 32 percent in the past
year, and silver prices have more than doubled.  “The U.S. credit rating will undoubtedly be lowered in
the next few years,” said  Michael Pento , a senior economist at
Euro Pacific Capital in New York. “This will mean much higher
borrowing costs and a much lower currency. International
investors have been using gold and silver as an alternative
currency and an alternative to the dollar, and this will only
exacerbate and accelerate that process.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $2.20, or 0.1 percent,
to settle at $1,495.10 at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price climbed as much as 0.5 percent to the record.  Gold for immediately delivery rose $1.97 to $1,497.27 at
3:49 p.m. New York time. Earlier, the price gained as much as
0.3 percent to an all-time high of $1,499.32.  Silver Climbs  Silver climbed as much as 2.8 percent to $44.175 in after-
hours trading. The most-active contract settled up 95.7 cents,
or 2.2 percent, to close at $43.913 an ounce.  “Silver is like gold on steroids,” said Jon Nadler, an
analyst at Kitco Inc. in  Montreal .  Euro Pacific’s Pento, who correctly predicted gold’s rally
in the past three years, said the metal will reach $1,600 in
2011. The commodity has gained every year since 2001 on
increased investment demand for raw materials.  “The bullish trend becomes pronounced as more and more
people get out of the dollar to buy hard assets,” said Lim Chae
Myung, a Seoul-based trader with Hyundai Futures Co.  The Treasury Department projected that the government may
reach the $14.3 trillion debt-ceiling limit as soon as mid-May
and run out of options for avoiding default by early July.  The  Federal Reserve  has kept its benchmark interest rate at
zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and has pledged
to buy $600 billion in Treasuries through June to stimulate
growth.  The ECB this month raised its main rate to 1.25 percent
from a record 1 percent to stem inflation.  The Fed probably won’t risk damping economic growth by
raising borrowing costs rapidly, Pento said.  S&P changed its long-term rating, citing “material risk”
that policy makers won’t reach an accord on “medium- and long-
term budgetary challenges.”  “There certainly has always been that lingering concern
over U.S. debt and the S&P people are finally identifying the
threat,” said Stephen Platt, an analyst at Archer Financial in
 Chicago . “The world is awash in liquidity. Gold’s slow,
grinding action upward shows the deterioration in the dollar,
excess liquidity and deficit problems are still in force.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
