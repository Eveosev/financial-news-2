Belle Corp. (BEL)  has delayed the opening
of its casino in Manila because it decided to increase the
gaming center’s floor area by 35 percent and to build more
facilities, Vice Chairman Willy Ocier said.  “We decided to upgrade our plans in light of positive
performance levels” of casinos in Singapore and “its tourism
industry,” Ocier said in a mobile phone text message. The new
target is the second quarter of 2012 instead of the fourth
quarter this year, he said.  Belle shares fell 1.4 percent to 5.52 pesos, set for the
lowest close since April 5.  Leisure & Resorts World Corp. (LR) , which
will operate the casino, decreased 1.8 percent to 10.82 pesos,
bound for the lowest close since April 8.  The delay in the opening of the casino was reported earlier
by BusinessWorld, ManilaStandardToday and BusinessMirror.  To contact the reporter on this story:
