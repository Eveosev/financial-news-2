Malawi ’s foreign affairs
minister summoned Fergus Cochrane-Dyet, the U.K. High
Commissioner in the country, because of comments contained
in a leaked cable to his government, said Lewis Kulisewa, a
spokesman for the commission.  Cochrane-Dyet was called in to see Malawi’s Foreign
Minister Etta Banda yesterday after the cable was published
in the Blantyre-based Nation newspaper on April 16,
Kulisewa said in an e-mailed response to question today.
Cochrane criticized Malawi’s president as being autocratic
in the diplomatic cable sent to U.K. Foreign Secretary
 William Hague , according to the Nation.  The U.K. warned Malawi that there will be consequences
if its envoy is asked to leave.  “If the government of Malawi pursued such action
there would likely to be consequences affecting the full
range of bilateral issues,” Geoffrey Adams, acting
permanent under secretary for the foreign and commonwealth
office, said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
