Wimbledon’s singles champions will
each receive 1.1 million pounds ($1.79 million), the most in the
history of the tennis tournament, the All England Club said.  The 100,000-pound increase for the winners comes as the
event, being held for the 125th time, competes with other
tournaments to compensate top players, Chairman Philip Brook
said.  “It is important that we offer prize money which suitably
rewards the players both for the box-office appeal they bring to
the event and for their supreme performances on the court,” he
said.  Total prize money will rise 6.4 percent to 14.6 million
pounds, the southwest London club said.  The tournament, where  Serena Williams  and  Rafael Nadal  are
defending champions, will be held June 20 through July 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
