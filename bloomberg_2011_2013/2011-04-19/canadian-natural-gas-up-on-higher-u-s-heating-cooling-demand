Canadian  natural gas  rose as late-
season cold in the U.S. Midwest boosts furnace use and warm
weather in the South spurs air-conditioning needs.  Demand for heat in the Chicago area will top normal by 52
percent tomorrow as cold weather lingers over the Midwest,
according to Weather Derivatives. Cooling needs elsewhere will
drive air conditioning use to 66 percent above seasonal norms
for the next week, the Belton, Missouri-based forecaster said.  “There’s a very big split between the North and the South
right now,” said Bob Haas, a meteorologist at MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . “You don’t get that too
often.”  Alberta  gas for May delivery rose 8.25 cents, or 2.4
percent, to C$3.46 per gigajoule ($3.42 per million British
thermal units) as of 3 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX,  a
Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to
users in Canada and the U.S. and is priced on TransCanada’s
Alberta system.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 12.4 cents, or 3 percent, to settle at $4.262
per million Btu.  Spot gas at a Chicago hub where Canadian gas is traded
dropped after touching a three-week high yesterday on forecasts
of colder weather. Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point
fell 3.49 cents to $4.4294 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western  Canada .  Hub Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas gained 0.19 cent to $4.1013, according to ICE. At
Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas was down 0.66 cent to $4.1761.  Volume on  TransCanada Corp.’s  Alberta system, which
collects the output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.2
billion cubic feet as of 1:30 p.m. in New York, about 88 million
below its target level.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.66 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.74 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 668 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.84 billion cubic feet today, about 74 percent of its
capacity of 2.51 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.82
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
