Japanese stocks fell for a third
day, sending the Topix to its lowest level in a month, after
 Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. long-term credit outlook to
negative, fueling concern the global economic recovery will slow.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, slid 3.1
percent. Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the crippled
Fukushima nuclear plant, sank 4.3 percent after the utility said
two of its reactors are still too radioactive to allow workers
inside.  TDK Corp. (6762) , the largest maker of magnetic heads for disk
drives, tumbled 7.6 percent after brokerages said a possible
buyout of one of its customers could hurt sales.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average retreated 1.2 percent to
9,441.03. The Topix lost 1.1 percent to 827.56, falling to its
lowest since March 17.  “If we get down to a point where the U.S. has its debt
downgraded, the deflatory effects will be felt globally,” said
Melbourne-based  Tim Schroeders  of Pengana Capital Ltd., which
manages about $1 billion. “A lot of credit is priced off U.S.
denominated debt, and those effects will be felt.”  The Topix has declined 9.6 percent since a magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami on March 11 devastated Japan’s northeast
coast and disabled a Tokyo Electric atomic power station. In the
same period the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent,
while the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index dropped 0.9 percent.  U.S. Debt Outlook  Stocks in the Topix are valued at 12.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500
and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  Markets from  New York  to  Hong Kong  and  Tokyo  retreated
after S&P’s rating service yesterday said the U.S. government
risks losing its AAA credit rating unless policy makers agree on
a plan by 2013 to reduce budget deficits and the national debt.  “We believe there is a material risk that U.S. policy
makers might not reach an agreement on how to address medium-and
long-term budgetary challenges by 2013,” New York-based S&P
said in a report yesterday. “If an agreement is not reached and
meaningful implementation does not begin by then, this would in
our view render the U.S. fiscal profile meaningfully weaker than
that of peer ‘AAA’ sovereigns.”  Toyota sank 3.1 percent to 3,125 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the
world’s biggest camera maker, slid 1.8 percent 3,555 yen.  Fanuc
Corp. (6954) , a manufacturer of factory robots which earns about 80
percent of revenue overseas, lost 1.8 percent to 12,890 yen.  Yen Gains  Exporters also declined after the yen rose against the
dollar and euro for a fourth day, as investors flocked to safer
assets on concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening and after
the downgrade to U.S. credit-rating outlook.  Japan’s currency appreciated to as high as 82.19 against
the dollar overnight, compared with 82.91 at the close of  stock
trading  in Tokyo yesterday. Against the euro, the yen
strengthened to 116.48 today from 119.16.  Tokyo Electric retreated 4.3 percent to 447 yen after the
utility said robots sent into two buildings at its damaged
Fukushima plant detected radiation levels too toxic for humans.  TDK tumbled 7.6 percent to 3,980 yen, its lowest since July
2009, on speculation a buyer of its drive heads, Samsung
Electronics Co., will sell its hard-drive unit to a competitor
that gets its parts from an internal supplier. The deal could
reduce TDK’s annual sales by as much as 69 billion yen ($840
million), Credit Suisse Group AG said in a letter to clients.  The planned sale of Samsung’s unit was reported by the Wall
Street Journal on April 17.  Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202) , Japan’s largest maker of light trucks,
gained 1.9 percent to 324 yen after Deutsche Bank AG initiated
coverage of Isuzu with a “buy” rating and set the stock price
estimate for 12 months at 450 yen.  To contact the reporters for this story:
