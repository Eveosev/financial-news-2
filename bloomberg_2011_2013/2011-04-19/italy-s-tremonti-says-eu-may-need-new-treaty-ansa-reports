Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti said the European Union’s governing treaty may have
been rendered obsolete by the financial crisis and the impact of
globalization and a new agreement should be considered, Ansa
news agency reported.  “They are products of a previous world,” Tremonti said in
testimony to the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the
European Parliament in Brussels, Ansa reported today. The global
financial crisis is a reason “to think about a new and more
intense European agreement,” he said.  Tremonti said that after the region’s debt crisis is
brought under control, the EU should consider collectively
selling bonds to finance investment, particularly in energy.
Tremonti also said that the EU has been “missing in action” in
terms of dealing with the flood of immigrants fleeing violence
in North Africa and arriving in  Italy , Ansa reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
