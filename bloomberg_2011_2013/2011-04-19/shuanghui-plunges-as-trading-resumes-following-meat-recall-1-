Henan Shuanghui Investment &
Development Co., the publicly traded unit of China’s biggest
food company, fell by the daily limit in Shenzhen trading as
shares resumed trading after being suspended amid a probe into
illegal additives found in its meat products.  Shuanghui slumped by 10 percent to 70.15 yuan as of the
11:30 a.m. break. The stock had been suspended since March 16
after the company confirmed a report by  China Central Television 
that an affiliate of Shuanghui purchased pigs which were fed a
banned additive that induce the growth of lean meat.  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  holds an indirect stake in the parent company
of Shuanghui, Angela Yu, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for the
U.S. bank said today.  “The incident will affect Shuanghui’s sales by between 2
billion yuan and 4 billion yuan ($306 million-$612 million) in
2011,” Tong Xun and Man Zhen, Shanghai-based analysts at
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., said in a report today. They cut
their earnings per-share forecast for this year by 15 percent to
2.88 yuan.  China is tightening food-safety controls after milk powder
tainted with the chemical melamine killed at least six children
in 2008. The government executed at least two people for their
roles in the scandal.  Shuanghui, based in central  China ’s Henan province, spent
31 million yuan in March to recall and dispose of meat products,
the company said in a statement yesterday after the stock market
closed. March sales were reduced by 1.34 billion yuan, according
to the statement.  ‘Leading’ Position  At least 22 people, including seven pig farm managers and
one purchaser at Shuanghui’s affiliate, were detained in
connection with the use of illegal additive, the Xinhua News
Agency reported last month.  Shenyin & Wanguo recommends buying Shuanghui’s shares if
the shares drop below 65 yuan, citing the medium- and long-term
prospects of the meat industry and the company’s “leading”
position. The price of 65 yuan represents 22.6 times estimated
earnings for 2011, according to the brokerage.  First-quarter profit may increase between 10 percent and
12.5 percent from a year earlier to 265 million yuan and 270
million yuan, Shuanghui said in yesterday’s statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
