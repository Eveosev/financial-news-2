Kenya ’s benchmark coffee grade rose
3.5 percent at auction today as buyers replenished their stocks
ahead of a two-month break, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The top arabica AA grade sold for an average of $405.97 for
a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, up from $392.24 at the previous
sale on April 12, the exchange said in an e-mailed report.
Supplies of the grade climbed 13 percent to 1,459 bags, it said.  “Demand was a little bit higher because buyers wanted to
boost their stocks before we break until June 14,” said Kizito
Keya, a trader at Mumba Coffee Ltd., by phone from Nairobi.  Arabica beans are grown in East Africa and Latin America
and are brewed by specialty companies including Starbucks Corp.  Kenya may produce about 40,000 metric tons this season,
James Wahome, quality manager at the  Coffee Board of Kenya , said
on Jan. 17. The nation produced 45,000 tons in the last season.  The East African country is trying to help small-scale
farmers revive output, which dropped from more than 100,000 tons
in 1988-89 because of a slump in global prices and farm
mismanagement.  The average price for all the coffee sold at the auction
declined 1.8 percent to $294.66 a bag, the exchange said. Sales
fell to 9,961 bags valued at $3.59 million, from 10,490 bags
worth $3.87 million last week, it said.  The following are details of the auction in U.S. dollars
for a 50-kilogram bag:  To contact the reporter on this story:
