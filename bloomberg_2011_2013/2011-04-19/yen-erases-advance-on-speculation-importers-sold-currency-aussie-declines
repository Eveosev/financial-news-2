The yen erased gains versus the
dollar and the euro on speculation Japanese importers sold their
nation’s currency after it rose for the past three days.  The yen lost its earlier advance when it strengthened
toward 82 per dollar, a level the currency reached after the
Group of Seven nations jointly intervened in the foreign-
exchange market last month. The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars weakened as losses in commodities and stocks damped
demand for higher-yielding assets.  “Importers were probably glad to see the yen climb back
to this level,” said Takashi Kudo, senior manager of the
foreign-exchange division support center in  Tokyo  at NTT
SmartTrade Inc., a unit of Japan’s biggest telephone company.
“Traders are paying attention to 82 yen” due to the G-7
intervention, he said.  The yen traded at 82.56 per dollar as of 10:05 a.m. in
Tokyo from 82.66 in  New York  yesterday, when it rose to 82.19,
the strongest since March 29. The yen weakened to 81.99 per
dollar when the intervention took place on March 18 from a
postwar high of 76.25 the previous day.  Japan ’s currency was at
117.56 per euro from 117.66. The dollar bought $1.4242 per euro
from $1.4235.  Australia ’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.0489, and New
Zealand’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to 78.78 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
