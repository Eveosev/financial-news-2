Semiconductor Manufacturing
International Corp. (981) , China’s biggest chipmaker, rose the most in
six months in  Hong Kong  trading after saying it may get a $250
million investment from the nation’s sovereign wealth fund.  SMIC jumped 8.2 percent to 66 Hong Kong cents, the biggest
gain since Oct. 19. The stock has advanced 18 percent this year,
compared with the 2.1 percent increase in the city’s benchmark
 Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   China Investment Corp. agreed to buy 360.6 million
convertible preferred shares that may be exchanged for an 11.6
percent stake in SMIC, the Shanghai-based chipmaker said in a
statement yesterday. The transaction is valued at the equivalent
of 53.9 Hong Kong cents a share, a discount of about 11.6
percent to the stock’s closing price yesterday, according to the
statement.  SMIC said the proposed investment from the sovereign wealth
fund will help it finance  capital spending  and repay debt. The
chipmaker said last month it may need to invest $12 billion over
the “next several years” to expand capacity.  Under the agreement, China Investment will also receive
warrants that allow it to subscribe for an additional 2.3
percent stake in SMIC, according to the statement.  SMIC, which posted a profit in 2010 after a run of five
straight annual losses, counts state-owned Datang Telecom
Technology & Industry Holdings Co. and local government-backed
Shanghai Industrial Investment (Holdings) Co., among its
investors.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch was SMIC’s adviser in the
proposed transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
