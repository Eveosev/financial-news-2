Vietnam ’s five-year bonds dropped,
pushing yields to more than a 12-month high, on concern
inflation accelerated in April. The dong gained.  Consumer prices increased 13.9 percent in March from a year
earlier, the most since February 2009, official figures show.
The General Statistics Office is due to report the April numbers
next week.  The yield on the government’s benchmark five-year bond rose
11 basis points to 12.23 percent, the highest level since April
26, 2010, according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Demand is very weak because investors are expecting
yields will reach 13 percent to 14 percent,” said Tran Thi Ngoc
Thanh, deputy manager of the investment banking division at
Sacombank Securities Joint-Stock Co. “There are forecasts in
the market that consumer prices will rise as much as 1.8 percent
this month.”  The dong gained 0.03 percent to 20,923 per dollar as of
2:58 p.m. in Hanoi, Bloomberg data show.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the  reference rate  at
20,733, compared with 20,728 yesterday, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editor: Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
