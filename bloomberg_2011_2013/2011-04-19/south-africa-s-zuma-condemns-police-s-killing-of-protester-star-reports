South Africa ’s President  Jacob Zuma 
condemned the killing of a protestor, Andries Tatane, by police
in the town of Ficksburg, Johannesburg’s Star newspaper
reported.  “The fact that they even kill the person, so many of them
beating one person, it indicates a very strange mentality in
terms of the police force,” Zuma said in an interview, the Star
reported.  Residents of Ficksburg demonstrated yesterday as six police
officers appeared in court for the killing of the protestor, the
Star said. Tatane’s death was filmed and broadcast on national
television, stoking condemnation from groups incluluding
opposition parties.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
