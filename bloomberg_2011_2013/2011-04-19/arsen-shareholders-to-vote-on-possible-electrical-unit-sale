Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) ,  India ’s
biggest engineering company, will seek shareholder approval for
a possible transfer or sale of its electrical and automation
unit as it focuses on project and construction businesses.  The company will hold a postal ballot on the proposal with
a May 23 deadline, it said in a stock exchange statement today.
The result will be announced two days later.  Larsen, based in Mumbai, is in talks to sell the unit,
which makes switchgears, electrical meters and industrial
automation systems, for as much as $3 billion, Reuters said last
week, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. Schneider
Electric SA and Eaton Corp. are among possible buyers, it said.  Three calls to Larsen’s Chief Financial Officer Yeshwant Moreshwar Deosthalee’s mobile phone went unanswered today.  The unit’s gross sales were 36.8 billion rupees ($830
million) in the year ended March 2010, a 15 percent increase,
according to today’s statement. Profit before interest and taxes
climbed 20 percent to 3.9 billion rupees.  Larsen will hold onto the unit’s medical-imaging equipment
business, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
