Hungaryâ€™s government dropped plans
to control prices as part of a comprehensive bill to regulate
the drug market,  Napi Gazdasag  reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  The regulations will require new entrants to the generic
drug market to apply prices 5 percent below the reference price,
the newspaper said.  The government is set to decide on the final measures next
week, according Napi.  To contact the reporters on this story:
