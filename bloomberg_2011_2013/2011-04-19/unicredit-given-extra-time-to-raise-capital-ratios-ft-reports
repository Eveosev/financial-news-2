UniCredit SpA (UCG)  has been given
additional time, until the end of the year, to raise capital to
comply with Italian regulators’ new equity requirements, the
Financial Times reported, citing two people briefed on the
matter.  Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti and Bank of Italy
Governor  Mario Draghi  have indicated UniCredit doesn’t need to
follow peers into rights offerings because of the lender’s
particular circumstances, the FT reported. These may include the
fact that the lender’s two biggest investors, the Libyan
Investment Authority and the Libyan Central Bank which together
own 7.5 percent of the bank’s shares, would be unable to
participate in a capital raising because of the conflict in
Libya, the FT said, citing unnamed bankers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
