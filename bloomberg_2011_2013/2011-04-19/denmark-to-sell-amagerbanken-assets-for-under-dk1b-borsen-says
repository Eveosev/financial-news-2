Denmark plans to sell the best-
placed branches and a 6 billion kroner ($1.14 billion) portfolio
of healthy loans from failed lender Amagerbanken A/S for less
than 1 billion kroner, Borsen reported on Tuesday.  Amagerbanken will not be able to sell a 12 billion kroner
loan portfolio in which all loans are either in default or have
owners unable to make payments, Chairman Niels Heering said,
according to Copenhagen-based Borsen.  Several Danish banks, foreign banks and private equity
funds are interested in buying parts of Amagerbanken, Heering
said, according to Borsen.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
