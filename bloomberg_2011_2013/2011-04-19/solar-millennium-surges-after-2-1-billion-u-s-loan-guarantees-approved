Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  rose as much as
11 percent today after the U.S Department of Energy offered a
$2.1 billion loan guarantee that will underpin financing for two
solar thermal plants in Blythe,  California .  The guarantees, offered as conditional commitment by U.S.
Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, are the precondition for
financing about 75 percent of the construction costs for the
first two of four planned solar-thermal plants, Solar Millennium
said in a statement last night.  The Erlangen, Germany-based solar thermal technology
company surged to as much as 21.65 euros a share, the highest
since Dec. 16.  “In times of restrictive public budgets, I am particularly
pleased that the U.S. government is so clearly committed to the
energy turnaround,” Christoph Wolff, chief executive officer of
Solar Millennium, said in the statement.  The Blythe project uses mirrors to concentrate the sun’s
energy rather than solar panels that convert light directly into
electricity. It’s the world’s largest solar power plant project,
according to Solar Millennium.  The company expects to complete the entire financing late
in the summer after negotiations with institutional investors,
the company said in the statement.  The  power plants  each have a capacity to produce 242
megawatts and will cost about $2.8 billion in total, according
to the statement. Solar Trust of America LLC, Solar Millennium’s
Oakland, California-based unit, started building the parabolic
trough power plants Blythe 1 and 2, at the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
