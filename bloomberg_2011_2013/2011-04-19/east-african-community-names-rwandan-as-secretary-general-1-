The  East African Community 
appointed Rwandan Health Minister Richard Sezibera as its new
secretary-general, replacing  Tanzania ’s Juma Mwapachu, whose
five-year term ends this month.  Sezibera’s deputy will be Enos Bukuku, deputy governor of
the Bank of Tanzania, according to a statement read today at an
EAC summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s commercial capital.  Sezibera is currently a member of the board of the Global
Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, which is co-funded by
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  The EAC post of secretary-general is a rotational position
among Uganda,  Kenya , Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi, the bloc’s
partner states. Rwanda and Burundi, which joined the community
in June 2007, hadn’t previously headed the organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
