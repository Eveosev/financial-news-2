Taiwan ’s dollar dropped for a third
day after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the long-term credit-rating
outlook for the U.S., sapping demand for emerging-market assets.  The island’s Taiex index of shares declined 0.9 percent
after New York-based S&P said there’s a one-in-three chance the
AAA credit rating of the U.S. government might be cut within two
years unless policy makers agree on a plan to reduce budget
deficits and the national debt.  “The cut in the U.S. credit rating is quite worrying and
has damped risk-taking,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-
income trader at Polaris Securities Co.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.125 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It earlier touched NT$29.171, the weakest level since
April 13. The local dollar has rallied 6.1 percent over the past
six months, the best performance among the 10 most-traded Asian
currencies.  The yield on the 1 percent bond due January 2016, the most-
active government security, was little changed at 1.073 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market, the island’s biggest
exchange for bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
