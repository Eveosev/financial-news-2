Officials in South Africa’s Eastern
Cape province identified four plants that may revive agriculture
and create employment in the region, Business Day reported,
citing Sitembele Mase, Chief Executive Officer of the Eastern
Cape Development Corp.  Pineapple, flax, hemp and agave americana have been singled
out for their ability to produce fibre, which can be used in the
textile and construction industries, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper reported. The company plans plants to process
pineapple waste in East London and Bathurst by 2014, while an
Agave factory is planned in the town of Graaff Reinet, Business
Day said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
