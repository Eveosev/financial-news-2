The rand strengthened against the
dollar after a central bank official said food prices posed
“significant upside risks” for inflation, fuelling speculation
the bank may raise borrowing costs as soon as July.  The currency advanced as much as 0.8 percent to 6.8084 per
dollar, and traded 0.5 percent stronger at 6.8284 as of 3:43
p.m. in Johannesburg. It was little changed at 9.7749 per euro
after advancing as much as 0.6 percent to 9.7135 in earlier
trading.  Data show an “accelerating trend” in food prices, Reserve
Bank Deputy Governor  Daniel Mminele  said in a speech in
 Washington  on April 16, published on the Pretoria-based central
bank’s website today. Second-round inflation, where increases in
fuel and commodity prices drive up prices of other goods, would
“need to be monitored very closely,” he said. The bank has
left its benchmark repurchase rate at 5.5 percent, a 30-year
low, since November.  “The bank will not be soft on signs of second-round
pressures, and will start a process of normalizing the repo rate
in the third quarter,” Johannesburg-based Citibank NA analysts
 Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall wrote in a research note.  The Pretoria-based government statistics agency will report
tomorrow that the  consumer price index  in  Africa ’s biggest
economy probably rose 4 percent in March from a year earlier,
compared with 3.7 percent in February, according to the median
estimate of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rate may
increase to close to the upper limit of the central bank’s 3 to
6 percent target range, Myburgh and Fall wrote.  Higher  interest rates  would increase the carry-trade appeal
of rand assets. In the carry trade, investors borrow in the
currency of nations with relatively low interest rates, and
invest the proceeds in high-yielding assets.  The rand pared earlier gains against the euro after a
report showed German manufacturing growth unexpectedly
accelerated, adding to speculation that the European Central
bank will raise interest rates further. The euro gained against
the dollar and yen after the report.  Bonds rallied. The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 added 15
cents to 121.25 rand, cutting the yield five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 7.69 percent. The 6.75 percent bonds
due 2021 gained 24 cents to 88.22 rand, driving the yield 4
basis points lower to 8.53 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
