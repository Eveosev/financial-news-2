Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the
fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, set aside $5.23 billion to
pay employee salaries, bonuses and benefits in the first
quarter, down 5 percent from a year earlier.  The compensation and benefits expense, the firm’s biggest
cost, is enough to pay each employee $147,825 for the quarter,
down 11 percent from $165,952 a year earlier, New York-based
Goldman Sachs said today in a statement. The bank employed
35,400 people at the end of March, up 7 percent from a year
earlier even after the firm cut 300 jobs in the first quarter.  Goldman Sachs has reduced pay since 2007, when Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein was awarded a record
$67.9 million bonus and the firm’s average compensation per
employee was $661,490. Last year average pay per employee
dropped 14 percent to $430,700 as the firm set aside 39 percent
of revenue for compensation. The ratio of compensation to
revenue was 44 percent in the first quarter, up from 43 percent
a year earlier.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, set aside $3.29 billion in the quarter to compensate
employees at its investment bank, or an average $124,300 per
person, according to the New York-based bank’s earnings report
last week.  Blankfein, 56, was awarded $18 million in stock and cash
bonuses for his 2010 performance, double his $9 million all-
stock award for 2009. Blankfein and six other senior officers
received no bonuses for 2008.  Wall Street firms typically set aside a portion of revenue
throughout the year for year-end bonuses, enabling the company
to increase or decrease pay in line with performance. Average
pay is derived by dividing total compensation and benefits by
the number of employees and doesn’t represent what workers
actually receive.  The reduction in compensation in the first quarter was less
than the 7 percent decline in revenue from a year earlier,
according to Goldman Sachs’s earnings statement. The firm’s
total operating expenses rose 3 percent as non-compensation
costs surged 23 percent from the first quarter of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
