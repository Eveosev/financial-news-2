A Tunisian court acquitted a
policewoman accused of attacking Mohamed Bouazizi, the street
trader whose self-immolation inspired a revolution that toppled
the country’s president, the woman’s lawyer said.  Fadia Hamdi was accused of slapping and humiliating
Bouazizi before he set himself on fire outside the governor’s
office on Dec. 17. She denied the charges, her lawyer, Basma
Mnassri, said.  “I was convinced that my client is innocent and I asked
for a fair trial,” Mnassri said today in a phone interview from
Sidi Bouzid. “Fadia Hamdi is a living martyr.” TAP, the state-
run news agency, said that the court threw out the charges after
Bouazizi’s family dropped their complaint.  Bouazizi, 26, who sold fruit and vegetables on a street in
Sidi Bouzid, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the
capital, Tunis, was harassed and heckled by local police for not
having a permit and his cart was confiscated.  The protests triggered by his death culminated in Tunisian
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s Jan. 14 flight to  Saudi
Arabia  and inspired a revolt in  Egypt  that led to the toppling
of President  Hosni Mubarak .  The ruling comes as unrest inspired by the Tunisian
uprising spreads throughout the Arab world, with protests
rocking Yemen and Syria and armed conflict in Tunisia’s eastern
neighbor,  Libya .  To contact the reporter on this story:
