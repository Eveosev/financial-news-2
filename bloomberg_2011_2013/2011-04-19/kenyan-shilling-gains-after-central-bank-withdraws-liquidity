Kenya ’s shilling gained against the
dollar after the central bank drained excess liquidity from the
market by selling repurchase agreements.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
to 83.80 shillings at 2:23 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, from
83.85 at the close yesterday. The shilling initially weakened as
much as 0.3 percent today amid “a bit of demand” from oil
importers purchasing dollars, said Joel Mbuvi, head of Treasury
at African Banking Corp.  “On the supply side, people have created short positions
on the dollar because of the tight liquidity in the market,”
Mbuvi said. A short position is a bet a currency will
depreciate. “We expect the shilling to remain steady, but more
skewed toward a strengthening on the back of the tight
liquidity. By the close of the week, we expect it to be at
around 83.50.”  The Central Bank of Kenya yesterday accepted 1 billion
shillings ($12 million) of bids for eight-day  repurchase
agreements  after offering 8 billion shillings. In these
transactions, Kenya’s central bank sells securities to banks to
withdraw excess funds from the financial system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
