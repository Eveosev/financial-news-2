Colombia’s peso climbed to a six-
month high on increased foreign direct investment flows and
speculation funds from abroad will continue to flow into the
South American country.  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 1,790.32 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:16 a.m. New York time, from 1,799.01 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,788.84, the strongest level since Oct. 13. The
currency has jumped 4.7 percent in the past month, the second-
best performance after the Brazilian real among 25 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Strong FDI flows have been coming in, especially in the
last two to three weeks,” said  Camilo Perez , head analyst at
Banco de Bogota SA, the country’s second-biggest bank.  The higher dollar inflows have increased the dollar cash
positions of financial intermediaries, according to Perez.
Colombian regulations don’t allow banks to have negative dollar
positions.  “You don’t have that technical constraint that was helping
limit gains in the peso,” he said.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
was little changed at 8.27 percent, according to  Colombia ’s
stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.035 centavo to 113.592
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
