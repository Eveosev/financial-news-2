An  Athens  city bus driver was
suspended after he took an unscheduled break yesterday forcing
passengers to disembark.  “Such behavior is incomprehensible particularly at a time
when passengers need public transport to overcome the long
crisis that has plagued them,” according to an e-mailed
statement from Greece’s  Transport Ministry .  Greece’s economy contracted 4.5 percent in 2010 and
unemployment hit a record 15.1 percent in January as the
government cut wages and raised taxes in exchange for a 110
billion-euro ($157.5 billion) bailout last year from the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
