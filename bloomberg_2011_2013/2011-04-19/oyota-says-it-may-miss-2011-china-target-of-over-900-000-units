Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the automaker
most affected by Japan’s record earthquake last month, may not
be able to meet its  China  sales target of over 900,000 vehicles
this year due to the impact of the disaster.  Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker, may have problems
with parts stemming from the March 11 earthquake, and
industrywide supply may fall short of demand in China, Masayoshi
Hori, executive coordinator for the automaker’s China unit, said
at the Shanghai auto show today. The carmaker’s China operation
is monitoring the component situation, he said.  The company based in Aichi, Japan, lost production of
260,000 units in Japan from March 14 to April 8. It has resumed
operations at all of its domestic plants, with output at 50
percent of normal levels. Manufacturing has been reduced at
overseas plants, including those in  North America ,  Europe  and
Australia.  “Toyota is the most vulnerable, as it is more exposed to
suppliers in Japan,” said  Ashvin Chotai , managing director of
Intelligence Asia Automotive.  About 150 components are currently in short supply,
compared with 500 two weeks ago, spokesman Masami Doi said
today. As a result, factories in China are not operating on
weekends, holidays or on overtime, Hori said.  Double China Sales  Separately, Hori said the automaker plans to double China
sales in 2015 from the 846,000 vehicles it sold in 2010.  Toyota fell 3.1 percent to 3,125 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in  Tokyo . The stock has declined 14 percent since March
10, the day before the temblor.  The maker of Prius hybrid cars is studying whether to
produce hybrid parts such as motors, batteries and inverters in
China, Hori said. Toyota will test electric cars in the country
this year, he said.  The Toyota City based company expects the Chinese  auto
industry  to grow by 10 percent to 15 percent this year, Managing
Officer Shinji Kitada said today in Shanghai.  Chinese demand is strongest for compact cars and sports
utility vehicles, he said, adding that Toyota is “able to
secure solid profitability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
