A Muslim group that campaigns
against British military involvement in  Afghanistan  applied for
permission to protest outside Westminster Abbey when  Prince William  gets married there on April 29, London’s police said.  “One of the biggest advocates of British imperialism,
Flight Lieutenant Prince William, wishes to enjoy an extravagant
wedding ceremony, ironically at the expense of the taxpayer,”
 Muslims Against Crusades  said on its website. “His direct
involvement with the murderous British military and eagerness to
inherit the reins of a kingdom built on blood and colonialism
clearly demonstrate what type of legacy he wishes to leave.”  Prince William, the second-in-line to the British throne,
will marry  Kate Middleton  next week in a ceremony that will
attract thousands of spectators in the streets between the Abbey
and  Buckingham Palace , along which the newly-weds will drive in
a horse-drawn carriage. The U.K. government says it expects 2
billion people around the world to watch on television.  The police are in discussions about preventing
demonstrations in London on the day, a spokesman who declined to
be identified in line with the force’s rules said by telephone
today. All protests along the route of the wedding are banned.
The  English Defence League , which campaigns against radical
Islamism in the U.K., also applied to protest against the Muslim
group, the police said.  The Metropolitan force said 5,000 officers will be on duty
on the day of the royal wedding, the Press Association news wire
reported.  To contact the reporter on the story:
