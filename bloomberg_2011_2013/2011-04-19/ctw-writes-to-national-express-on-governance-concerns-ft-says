CTW Investment Group, a union-
backed alliance of investment funds, has written to  National
Express Group Plc (NEX)  Chairman John Devaney to say it is concerned
about the company’s approach to identifying and nominating new
non-executive directors, the Financial Times reported, citing
the letter.  While CTW doesn’t support Elliott Advisors in its dispute
with  National Express , it is “deeply concerned about the
ability of the board’s nominating committee to independently and
thoughtfully execute its responsibilities in the best interest
of the company and its shareholders,” the FT reported.  “There is no lack of procedural coherence as claimed,”
National Express said, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
