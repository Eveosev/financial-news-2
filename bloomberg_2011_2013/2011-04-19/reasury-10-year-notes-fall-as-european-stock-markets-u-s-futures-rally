Treasuries fluctuated as stocks
extended an advance after a government report showed an increase
in U.S. housing starts.  Ten-year note yields were at almost the lowest level in
three weeks as  Europe ’s debt crisis outweighed a cut yesterday
in the U.S. credit-rating outlook by  Standard & Poor’s .  “The market is choppy in a thin environment,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in  New York  at Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group.  Ten-year yields were little changed at 3.37 percent at
10:35 a.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. They fell yesterday to as low as 3.36 percent, the least
since March 24. The 3.625 percent security due in February 2021
rose 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 102 1/8. Two-
year notes yielded 0.66 percent.  The yields are down from 3.80 percent a year ago and below
the average of 5.21 percent over the last two decades even with
the U.S. projected to post a deficit in excess of $1 trillion
for a third consecutive year.  The gain in housing starts failed to make up for ground
lost the prior month. They rose 7.2 percent, Commerce Department
data showed, compared with an 8.6 percent gain forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey and an 18.5 percent drop in February.  Work began on 549,000 houses at an annual pace, the data
showed, compared with a 520,000 estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index advanced 0.5 percent.  Still ‘Attractive’  Treasuries rose earlier as Japanese Finance Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda  said at a press conference in  Tokyo  that the debt
remains “attractive” even after the S&P lowered the U.S.
rating outlook.  The rating company put the U.S. government on notice
yesterday that it risks losing its AAA ranking unless lawmakers
agree on a plan by 2013 to meet medium- and long-term budget
challenges.  Greek bond yields reached euro-era records amid growing
speculation the country will need to restructure its debt as
financing costs mount.  Greece ’s two-year note yield reached
20.64 percent.  The Federal Reserve is buying $5 billion to $7 billion
today of Treasuries due from October 2013 to March 2015 as part
of its program to purchase $600 billion of  U.S. debt  through
June to spur economic growth.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 30-year bonds
instead of two-year notes slipped to 3.79 percentage points,
from 3.80 percentage points yesterday. It closed at a record
4.02 percentage points on Feb. 1.  Inflation Expectations  The difference in yields between 10-year Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities and comparable U.S. notes, a measure of
trader expectations for inflation over the life of the debt,
narrowed for a third day, decreasing to 2.60 percentage points.
The gap, called the break-even rate, reached 2.67 percentage
points on April 11, the widest since March 2008. The average for
the five years before the financial crisis began in 2008 was
2.42 percentage points.  A gauge of inflation expectations that the  Federal Reserve 
uses to help determine monetary policy, the five-year, five-year
forward break-even rate, was at 3.13 percentage points, compared
with 3.28 percentage points on Dec. 15, a 10-month high. The
average for the past five years is 2.78 percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
