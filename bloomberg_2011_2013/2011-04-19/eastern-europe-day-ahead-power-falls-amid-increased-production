Day-ahead power prices in eastern
 Europe  decreased as output rose in the  Czech Republic  and
exports from  Poland  were less profitable.  Polish electricity for tomorrow fell 1.7 percent to 219
zloty ($78.66) a megawatt-hour, according to Polish power
exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.  Czech day-ahead power decreased 3.5 percent to 55 euros
($78.59) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg, as output increased from the nuclear plant Dukovany
which restarted two units after an outage. As result, imports of
electricity from Poland were set to drop, data from the  power
grid  showed.  Hungarian electricity, traded on the Budapest-based power
exchange, lost 2.8 percent to 56.45 euros, according to the
bourse’s website.  The Czech Republic has 17,625 megawatts of capacity
installed, according to Bloomberg data. The country exported
2,246 megawatts of power to  Germany  from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. local
time today, according to  Entsoe , the European Transmission
System Operators transparency platform.  Domestic demand at that time was nearly 8,500 megawatts,
while about 1,400 megawatts of solar electricity was generated,
according to CEPS AS, the Czech power transmission system
operator.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
Group Inc., ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition and Tullett
Prebon Plc. Brokers handle the majority of trading in Europe’s
electricity markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
