Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  and other ethylene
producers will obtain higher prices as China Petrochemical Corp.
cuts chemical output to bolster domestic fuel supplies, said an
analyst at Alembic Global Advisors.  Sinopec Group, as  Asia ’s biggest oil refiner is known, is
halting fuel exports and cutting petrochemical production to
boost output of gasoline and diesel for domestic use, the
Beijing-based company said in its online  newsletter  today. It
has about 6.5 percent of global supply of ethylene, used to make
plastics,  Hassan Ahmed , an Alembic analyst, said today.  Sinopec’s cut will make ethylene markets tighter and help
price increases exceed 1.25 cents per pound in April and 2 cents
in May, the current forecast from Houston-based Chemical Market
Associates Inc., New York-based Ahmed said in a note. Ethylene
is currently about 54 cents a pound, he said.  Beneficiaries include Dow Chemical,  LyondellBasell
Industries NV (LYB) , Westlake Chemical Co., Industries Qatar and  Saudi
Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , he said.  Sinopec may reduce ethylene output by 10 percent in May,
ICIS News reported yesterday, citing an unnamed person close to
the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
