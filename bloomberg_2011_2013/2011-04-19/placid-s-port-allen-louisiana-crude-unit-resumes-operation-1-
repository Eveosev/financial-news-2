Placid Refining Co. LLC’s Port
Allen,  Louisiana , refinery resumed operations at a crude unit
today after completing repairs.  The unit and several other downstream process components
were shut after a fire April 17 at the 59,000-barrel-a-day
refinery, the company said yesterday.  Customer supplies weren’t affected, according to a
statement e-mailed by Rafael Bermudez, an outside spokesman.  The plant supplies jet fuel to the U.S. military, Bermudez
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
