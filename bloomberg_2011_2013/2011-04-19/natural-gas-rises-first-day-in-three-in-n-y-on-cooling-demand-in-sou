Natural gas futures gained the most
in more than three weeks as forecasts showed hotter-than-normal
weather in southern states, lifting demand for gas-fired
electricity for air-conditioning.  Gas rose for the first time in three days as forecasters
including Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland ,
said temperatures may be 14 degrees above normal in the South
through April 28. Scheduled gas deliveries to U.S. power plants
rose to the highest level in almost 10 weeks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s very hot in  Florida  and Texas, unseasonably hot, and
that should lift power demand,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst
with PFGBest in  Chicago . “We’re hanging around the 200-day
moving average. I don’t see anything that’s going to
dramatically move gas south in the short-term.”  Natural gas for May delivery gained 12.4 cents, or 3
percent, to settle at $4.262 per million British thermal units
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the biggest percentage gain
since March 25. The 200-day moving average was $4.1298. The
futures have risen 8.1 percent from a year ago.  The warm weather across the South will spread along the
East Coast into  New York  and  New England  by the end of the
month, according to Commodity Weather Group.  Houston will have a high of 91 degrees Fahrenheit (33
Celsius) on April 27, 10 degrees above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. The high
temperatures in Jacksonville, Florida, will stay above 80
degrees this month.  Hottest April  “The South is expected to experience one of the hottest
Aprils in history, which should generate incremental increases
in power loads,” Shiyang Wang, an analyst at  Barclays Capital 
in New York, said in a note to clients today.  Scheduled gas deliveries to power plants increased 4.2
percent today to 14.4 million dekatherms (14.1 billion cubic
feet), the highest level since Feb. 10, according to Bloomberg
data based on a sampling of gas pipeline nominations.  Deliveries to Texas for power generation were set to rise
8.4 percent to 2.33 million dekatherms, and planned deliveries
to Florida’s power plants gained 0.9 percent to 2.86 million
dekatherms, the data showed.  Global output of liquefied natural gas reached a record in
March after Qatar increased shipments,  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA said
in a report today.  Production of the fuel climbed to 21.8 million metric tons
last month, Thierry Bros, a Paris-based analyst for the bank,
said in the report.  LNG imports to the U.S. will fall to the equivalent of 1.05
billion cubic feet a day of gas, down from 1.18 billion a year
ago, according to Energy Department estimates.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
254,610 as of 2:37 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 324,000. Volume was 320,315 yesterday. Open interest was a
record 983,802 contracts, according to the exchange. The three-
month average open interest is 913,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
