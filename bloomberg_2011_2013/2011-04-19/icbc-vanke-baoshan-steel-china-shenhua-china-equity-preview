Shenzhen.  CSC Nanjing Tanker Corp. (600087)  (600087 CH) lost 3.4 percent to
6.01 yuan, the biggest decline since March 4. The stock was cut
to “neutral” at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., which cited
overcapacity in the oil shipping industry and the company’s
“relatively high” price-to-book-value ratio. The previous

Bloomberg.  Hong Yuan Securities Co. (000562 CH) slid 3.1 percent to
17.76 yuan, the most since March 17. The brokerage said first-
