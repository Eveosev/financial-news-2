Rick Adelman won’t return as coach
of the  Houston Rockets  next season, ending a four-year tenure
during which he had the best winning percentage in franchise
history.  Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey said in a  statement 
that the team and Adelman agreed to part ways after missing the
National Basketball Association playoffs the past two seasons
even though they had a winning record.  “He is a Hall of Fame coach who earned the respect and
admiration of our entire organization during his time here,”
Morey said. “These situations are always difficult, but we
would like to personally thank Rick and his staff for their
efforts the past four seasons.”  Adelman, 64, had a 193-135 record with Houston for a
franchise-best .588 winning percentage.  The Rockets’ lone  playoff series victory  during the past 14
years came under Adelman after the 2008-09 season, when they
beat  Portland  in the first round before losing to the  Los
Angeles Lakers  in the conference semifinals.  All-Star center Yao Ming was injured in that playoff series
and has played in five games over the past two NBA seasons. The
Rockets have since transitioned from a team that was built
around the 7-foot-6 Yao and fellow All-Star Tracy McGrady, who
was traded in February 2010.  Houston went 43-39 this season, finishing three games
behind  Memphis  for the final playoff spot in the Western
Conference. The Rockets are the first team to miss the playoffs
in consecutive years with a winning record since the  Phoenix
Suns  in 1971-72, the Houston Chronicle said.  “We accomplished quite a bit, despite overcoming numerous
obstacles during the past few years,” Adelman said in a
statement. “I especially enjoyed coaching this group of players
the past two seasons. Despite difficult circumstances, they
never gave in and they never quit.”  Adelman has a career coaching record of 945-616 and his win
total ranks eighth in NBA history. He also coached the  Portland
Trail Blazers  from 1988 to 1994, the Golden State Warriors from
1995 to 1997 and the  Sacramento Kings  from 1998 to 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
