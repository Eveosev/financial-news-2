Tesco Plc (TSCO)  Chief Executive Officer
Philip Clarke told Sky News in an interview he expects the
retailer will create 24,000 jobs globally this year, about one-
third of which will be in the U.K.  The U.K. jobs will be created across the company’s
operations in the country, Clarke said, adding that 8,000 is a
realistic prediction because it includes “banking services,
online businesses and our stores, and we’re opening new stores
that will create new jobs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
