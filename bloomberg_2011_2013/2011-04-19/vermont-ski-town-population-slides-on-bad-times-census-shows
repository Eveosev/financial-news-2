Business leaders in  Vermont ’s
Deerfield Valley promote the area with the slogan “It’s More
Vermont Here.” Trouble is, there are fewer Vermonters. Dover,
the heart of the valley and home to one of the closest ski
resorts to  New York  and  Boston , lost a fifth of its population
over the last decade.  Battered by a  collapse  in the second-home market and a slow
tourist economy, residents fled southern Vermont’s ski region
from 2000 to 2010, census figures show. Three other resort towns
-- Killington, Ludlow and Wilmington -- collectively lost 1,119
residents, or 19.4 percent of their population, even as the
state  gained 2.8 percent  to 625,741.  “I’ve had good times, and I’ve had bad times,” said
Richard Moore, owner of a Killington-based construction company.
“Right now, I’m having really bad times.”  Killington, which has the state’s largest ski resort, lost
25.9 percent of its population, falling to 811 full-time
residents. Census figures show the number of new housing permits
dropped from 20 in 2000 to three in 2009. The town now has 2,609
housing units, or more than three for every resident.  Dover, home to Mount Snow and one of five towns in
Deerfield Valley, lost 20.3 percent of its population over the
decade, falling to 1,124 residents from 1,410, the census shows.
The five towns combined lost 9 percent.  Caribbean Looks Cheaper  Art Woolf , a University of Vermont economist, said the
population declines may have long-term consequences.  “Full-time residents are leaving, which is going to make
it harder for the ski industry in those areas (the mountain,
inns, restaurants, etc.) to find workers,” he said in an e-
mail. “That will drive up wages, which will drive up costs.
That Caribbean cruise will look cheaper than the Vermont ski
vacation.”  The exodus hasn’t yet affected local ski operations, said
Sarah Thorson, a spokeswoman for  Killington Resort .  She said
the mountain relies heavily upon workers from nearby Rutland, a
city of 16,495 that lost 4.6 percent of its population over the
decade. The resort, which has about 1,500 workers during peak
winter ski season, also uses exchange students from  Peru ,
 Jamaica  and  South Africa .  Vermont’s government has been aggressive in pushing the
state as a four-season destination for tourists, who made 13.4
million visits in 2007, the last figures available.  Economic Pillars  Tourism and real estate are economic pillars because
Vermont’s industry is limited: Its biggest brands include  Green
Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) ,  King Arthur Flour Co.  and Ben &
Jerry’s, a subsidiary of London-based Unilever.  Housing construction permits fell statewide to 1,367 in
2009, the lowest since 1966, from a 2004 peak of 3,588, census
figures show. Taxable receipts on hotel rooms dropped in January
2010 to $32.1 million, down 4.5 percent from January 2008,
according to the Vermont Department of Taxes.  Tourism accounted for 12 percent of the state’s jobs in
2007, according to the Vermont Department of Tourism.  People are attracted to Vermont by its natural beauty and
quality of life. Pedestrians have the right of way. Billboards
are outlawed. Mobile-phone service is sporadic. There are just
four Starbucks stores in the state,  all around  Burlington.  Families Head Out  Still, families are leading the exodus from many towns.  Dover’s elementary school, which sits on a hilltop with a
view of the Green Mountains, has seen enrollment drop to 88 this
year from 125 in 1990-91. School officials said they expect to
honor eight sixth-grade graduates on the town common at a June
graduation ceremony.  Census figures show the number of Dover residents younger
than 18 plunged 40.3 percent, falling to 187 from 313.  The population loss is masked every winter, when thousands
of people come to stay at condominiums and hotels that dot the
slopes around Mount Snow. Dover records show 87 percent of
property tax bills are mailed to out-of-state residents.  The loss of people doesn’t trouble everyone.  Bill McKibben ,
a writer, climate-change activist and scholar-in-residence at
Middlebury College, said he’d “rather have quality than
quantity.”  The population gains Vermont did have were driven by
Burlington, the state’s largest city, and its suburbs.
Burlington grew 9.1 percent to 42,417 people. Essex, home to an
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  plant, gained 5.2 percent
to 19,587.  Rockwell’s Town Loses  Other towns near tourist destinations lost residents or had
flat growth. Arlington, a town on the west side of the Green
Mountains and a former home to the artist Norman Rockwell, fell
to 2,317 people from 2,397. Woodstock, once named “The
Prettiest Small Town in America” by Ladies’ Home Journal, saw
its population drop 5.5 percent to 3,048. The number of people
in Brattleboro, a clothing-optional, small-town doppelganger for
Berkeley,  California , rose to 12,046 -- a gain of 41 residents
over a 10-year period.  Unemployment has remained low, relative to the rest of the
country. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in February
that 5.6 percent of Vermont residents were unemployed, compared
with 8.9 percent nationwide that month.  Philip K. Dodd , a Montpelier lawyer who publishes the
bimonthly Vermont Property Owners Report, said things could be
worse. The state added 28,157 homes over the decade.  “We went less overboard than other places,” he said.
“But some sold, and some didn’t.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
