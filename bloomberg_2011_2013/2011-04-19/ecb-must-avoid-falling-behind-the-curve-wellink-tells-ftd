European Central Bank Governing
Council Member Nout Wellink said policy makers must stay “very
alert” to avoid being “behind the curve,” Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing an interview.  “We’re not behind the curve yet, but we’re also not much
ahead,” the newspaper quoted Wellink as saying. “There are
many reasons to monitor the situation closely and act
immediately if necessary.”  Wellink also said debt sustainability analyses for  Greece 
show that the country can restore its public finances without a
restructuring. Countries such as Greece made mistakes in the
past and owe it to themselves to solve their problems, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
