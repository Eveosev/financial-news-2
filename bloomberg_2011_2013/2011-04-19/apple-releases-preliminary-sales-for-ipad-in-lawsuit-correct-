Apple Inc. (AAPL) , scheduled to disclose
financial results tomorrow, released some preliminary sales
numbers for the iPad tablet computer and iPhone in a lawsuit
last week.  In an intellectual property complaint Apple filed on April
15 against Samsung Electronics Co., the company said it had sold
more than 19 million iPads by March 2011. Based on unit sales in
earlier quarters, that indicates at least 4.21 million iPads
sold during the fiscal second quarter, less than the 6.1-million
average estimate of 13 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple has had trouble keeping the iPad 2 in stock at stores
since it was released on March 11. At the same time, iPhone
sales may have exceeded estimates, based on figures in the
lawsuit. The complaint says Apple had sold more than 108 million
iPhones by March, which would mean at least 18 million sold in
the second quarter, more than the 16.3 million estimated by
analysts. Apple also said it had sold more than 60 million of
its iPod Touch media players.  The lawsuit doesn’t say when in March the sales figures run
through. The company’s second quarter ended on March 26. Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based Apple,
declined to comment. Apple reports financial results tomorrow
after U.S. markets close.  The computer maker’s iPhone became available on the Verizon
Wireless network for the first time during the second quarter.
In the quarter, analysts predict Apple will report profit of
$5.03 billion on sales of $23.4 billion, according to the
average of 35 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple rose $6.01, or 1.8 percent, to $337.86 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have risen
4.7 percent this year.  The sales figures in the lawsuit were earlier reported by
the website  Asymco.com .  To contact the reporter on this story:
