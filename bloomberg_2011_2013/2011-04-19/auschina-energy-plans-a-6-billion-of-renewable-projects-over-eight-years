AusChina Energy Group, a venture
between  Australia ’s  CBD Energy Ltd. (CBD)  and two Chinese companies,
plans to develop A$6 billion ($6.3 billion) of renewable-energy
projects over the next eight years.  The venture between CBD, China Datang Renewable Power Co.
and Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co. aims to get a third of
Australia’s renewable-energy market by investing in wind farms,
solar-thermal and energy-storage projects, CBD said in a
statement to the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday.  AusChina Energy has an initial 1,500 megawatts of projects
on which it plans to spend A$3 billion to develop by 2014. The
Chinese partners will provide equipment and funding to the
venture, according to the statement.  China Datang, based in Beijing, holds a 63.75 percent stake
in the venture, while Double Bay-based CBD has 23.75 percent and
Hebei-based Baoding Tianwei holds 12.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
