Oceanic Bank International Plc (OCEANIC) , a
Nigerian lender bailed out by the central bank in 2009, fell the
most in a week after saying recapitalization talks between it
and First Bank of  Nigeria  Plc had ended.  The stock lost 10 kobo, or the maximum 5 percent daily
limit, to 1.90 naira by 2:02 p.m. in Lagos, its biggest intraday
decline since April 12.  Both sides decided to discontinue the talks because they
were unable to agree on the terms of the consideration, they
said in an e-mailed statement today. Oceanic said it is
“working at concluding other recapitalization plans and details
of such will be unveiled in the next couple of weeks,”
according to the statement.  A debt crisis arising from loans to speculators on the
local stock market and operators in the oil and gas industry
threatened the banking industry with collapse, prompting the
 Central Bank of Nigeria  to use 620 billion naira ($4 billion) to
bail out some lenders in 2009, and fired the chief executives of
eight of the lenders.  The  central bank  set up the Asset Management Corp. of
Nigeria to buy bad debts from the lenders and recapitalize the
bailed-out banks, before matching them with potential investors.  First Bank ended the talks to purse an “organic growth,”
Group Managing Director Bisi Onasanya said in an interview with
Johannesburg-based CNBC Africa television yesterday.  “We had always been clear from the beginning that we would
only do a deal that would bring value to our shareholders,”
Onasanya said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
