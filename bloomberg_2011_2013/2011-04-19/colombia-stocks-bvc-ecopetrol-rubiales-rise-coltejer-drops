The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.8 percent to 14,052.65, while the
Colcap Index gained 0.5 percent to 1,661.23, its biggest gain in
two weeks.  Bolsa de Valores de Colombia (BVC)  SA, the operator of
the country’s main securities exchange, rose 0.8 percent to 40
pesos. Colombia’s Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in
an interview yesterday that a victory by Peruvian presidential
candidate Ollanta Humala is unlikely to threaten Colombian
assets or a planned merger of the two nations’ stock exchanges.  Coltejer SA (COLTEJ)  , the Medellin-based clothing maker
and exporter, fell 1.2 percent to 86 centavos as Colombia’s peso
climbed to an almost three-year high on increased foreign direct
investment flows, reducing revenue for exporters.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL CB) and  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp (PRE) 
, the two most weighted stocks on the Colombian bourse,
gained as oil increased for the fourth time in five days as
speculation that the  European Central Bank  will further raise
interest rates strengthened the euro against the dollar,
boosting commodities’ appeal as an alternate investment.  Ecopetrol, Colombia’s largest oil producer, rose 1.8
percent to 3,670 pesos, its largest increase in three weeks.
Pacific Rubiales, the Toronto-based  oil company  with fields in
Colombia, rose 2.1 percent to 52,440 pesos, its biggest jump in
two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
