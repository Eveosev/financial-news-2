Portugal ’s port of Sines is
scheduled to receive a shipment of liquefied natural gas from
 Nigeria  on April 22.  The LNG Sokoto is sailing from Bonny in Nigeria, according
to the website of  Administracao do Porto de Sines SA , the port’s
management company.  The Sines LNG terminal, with a capacity of 5.26 billion
cubic meters of natural gas a year, is managed by REN-Redes
Energeticas Nacionais SA, the nation’s power and gas grid
operator. LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for shipment by
tanker and then converted back to a gas at terminals for
distribution to users.  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s biggest oil and gas
company, receives LNG at Sines as well as gas from  Algeria 
through a pipeline crossing Morocco and  Spain . Galp also
operates Portugal’s largest refinery at Sines. EDP-Energias de
Portugal SA, the country’s biggest power utility, runs a coal-
fired electricity plant at the site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
