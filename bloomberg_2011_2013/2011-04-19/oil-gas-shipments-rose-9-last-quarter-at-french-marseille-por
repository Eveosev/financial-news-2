Crude, oil-product and natural-gas
cargoes handled by  Marseille port ,  France ’s largest, increased 9
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.  Volumes rose to 15.3 million metric tons compared with 14.1
million tons a year ago, the port authority said today in an e-
mailed statement. Shipments of liquefied natural gas climbed 46
percent to 1.9 million tons, it said.  In March, hydrocarbon shipments fell 3.7 percent from a
year earlier to 4.9 million tons because of lower crude imports
from  Libya , according to the port.  “The 20 percent drop in crude oil traffic with Libya, the
number one client of the port in 2010, was apparently filled by
diversification of supply sources by importers,” the port said.  Crude imports destined for  Europe  climbed by 6 percent, led
by Petroplus Holdings AG’s Cressier refinery in Switzerland,
which increased volumes by 17 percent in the quarter versus a
year earlier, the port said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
