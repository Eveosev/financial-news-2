U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains after housing starts exceeded estimates, building on an
earlier advance spurred by higher-than-estimated earnings at
companies from Johnson & Johnson to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index futures expiring in June rose
0.3 percent to 1,304.4 at 8:44 a.m. in  New York , after the
benchmark gauge dropped 1.1 percent yesterday. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures advanced 0.3 percent to 12,179 today
and Nasdaq-100 Index futures gained 0.2 percent to 2,295.25.  Work began on 549,000 houses at an annual pace, up 7.2
percent from the prior month and exceeding the 520,000 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, figures from
the Commerce Department showed today in  Washington . Starts fell
19 percent in February to the lowest level in almost two years.
Building permits, a proxy for future construction, rose 11
percent to a 594,000 pace. They were projected to rise 1.1
percent to a 540,000 annual pace.  U.S. stocks tumbled yesterday after Standard & Poor’s cut
the nation’s long-term sovereign credit outlook to negative from
stable, citing rising budget deficits and debt. The  S&P 500  had
rallied 4.9 percent from the start of this year through April
15, boosted by higher-than-estimated corporate earnings and
government stimulus measures.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may keep
reinvesting the proceeds of maturing debt into Treasuries to
maintain record stimulus even after pledging to complete $600
billion in bond purchases by the end of June.  Bernanke’s top two lieutenants said this month that the
economy and inflation are too weak to start reversing monetary
policy. Investors and economists including  David Kelly  at
JPMorgan Funds see that as a signal the Fed will keep its
balance sheet at current levels by replacing about $17 billion a
month in maturing mortgage debt with Treasuries.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
