The Teacher Retirement System of
 Texas  needs an annual return of 21 percent in the year ending
Aug. 31 to maintain an 80 percent funded ratio, the level
actuaries consider adequate to cover liabilities, said its
deputy director.  “We’d have to have remarkable investment returns for the
rest of the year to reach 80 percent,” Brian Guthrie, the
fund’s executive director-designate, said at a Texas House
hearing today in Austin.  The fund’s investment return was 14.7 percent in 2010, the
best among large public pension funds, Chief Investment Officer
Britt Harris said at an April 7 board meeting. The fund had
about $109 billion on April 1, up from $95.7 billion in
September.  Even with the gains, the pension’s funded ratio -- the
portion of promised benefits covered by current assets --
dropped to 81.3 percent as of Feb. 28 from 82.9 percent on Aug.
31, 2010, because of trading losses in 2008 and 2009 included
through a process called smoothing, Executive Director Ronnie Jung said April 7.  Public pensions nationwide are grappling with about $3.6
trillion in unfunded liabilities, according to a  2010 study  by
 Joshua Rauh  of  Northwestern University  and Robert Novy-Marx of
the University of Rochester.  Texas Teachers’  annualized return  for the decade ended Dec.
31 was 4.8 percent, below the fund’s assumption of an 8 percent
annual return.  Texas legislators are considering reducing the state’s
contribution to the fund, which is now 6.64 percent of
employees’ salaries. The Texas House earlier this month passed a
budget that would  cut  general revenue spending by $4.6 billion,
or 5.2 percent, during the 2012-2013 biennium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
