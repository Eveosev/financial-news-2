Inflation in  Nigeria , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s second-biggest economy, is accelerating amid rising
global costs for food and energy, said Lamido Sanusi, the
governor the country’s central bank.  Increasing costs of building materials and household items
are adding pressure to the inflation rate, Sanusi said in a
phone interview late yesterday.  Nigeria’s inflation rate rose to an annual 12.8 percent in
March from 11.1 percent a month earlier, the Abuja-based
 National Bureau of Statistics  said yesterday. The  Central Bank
of Nigeria  raised its benchmark interest rate by one percentage
point, the second increase this year, on March 22 in an effort
to slow the rate of inflation.  “We had anticipated, in the light of rising global food
and energy prices, that structural pressures would impact on
inflation,” said Sanusi. Fuel costs, specifically for kerosene
and diesel that are not covered by government subsidy, are
particularly “susceptible to rising prices,” he said.  Nigeria ’s government guarantees a price per liter of
gasoline at 65 naira ($0.42) and pays the difference when oil
costs climb. Kerosene is commonly used for cooking and diesel is
used in generators that are needed to combat the country’s
frequent power cuts.  Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil producer, boosted spending
ahead of this year’s elections, adding to pressure on inflation.
The parliament approved a 4.97 trillion-naira expenditure plan
for the 2011 fiscal year, which is “unduly expansionary,”
Sanusi said on March 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
