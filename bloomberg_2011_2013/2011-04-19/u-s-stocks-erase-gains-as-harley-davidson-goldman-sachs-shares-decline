U.S. stocks erased an early advance
as Harley-Davidson Inc. led consumer shares lower after earnings
trailed analysts’ estimates and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. slumped
as an analyst cut his rating on the shares.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,304.57 at 11:25 a.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  climbed 4.28 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,205.87 after rallying as much as 48 points
earlier.  Earlier gains came after housing starts increased and
earnings beat estimates at companies from Johnson & Johnson to
Zions Bancorp.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
