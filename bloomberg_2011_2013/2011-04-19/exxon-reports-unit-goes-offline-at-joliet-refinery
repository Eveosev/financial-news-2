Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  reported that a
fluid catalytic cracker at its Joliet refinery in  Illinois  had
an upset yesterday.  A mechanical failure caused the unit to trip, according to
a  filing  with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. Workers
were investigating what caused the incident at the time of the
filing, late yesterday.  Kevin Allexon, an Exxon spokesman, said in an e-mail that
in a filing to the National Response Center the company
identified the unit as a fluid catalytic cracker and that the
unit was involved in an operational upset. “There is no impact
on production,” he said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 1.5 cents to 3.75 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:50 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
1.39 cents to $3.1864 a gallon.  The 248,000-barrel-a-day refinery processes Canadian crude
delivered by pipeline by Enbridge Energy Partners LP. The
refinery produces gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and
asphalt among other products, according to Exxon Mobil.  The Joliet refinery is 42 miles (68 kilometers) southwest
of Chicago on the Des Plaines River.  To contact the reporter on this story:
