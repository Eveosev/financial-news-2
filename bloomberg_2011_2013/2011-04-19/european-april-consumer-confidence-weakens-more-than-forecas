European  consumer confidence 
weakened more than economists forecast in April as surging
energy costs sapped households’ spending power and countries
from Ireland to Spain cut spending to lower budget deficits.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
fell for a second month to minus 11.4 from minus 10.6 in March,
the Brussels-based European Commission said in an initial
estimate today. That’s the lowest since August. Economists
forecast a drop to minus 11, the median of 22 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  The commission is scheduled to publish its monthly report
on euro-area economic confidence, which includes the consumer-
confidence gauge, on April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
