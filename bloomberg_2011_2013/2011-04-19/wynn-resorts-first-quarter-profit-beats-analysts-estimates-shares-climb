April 2010, doubling its presence in the world’s biggest
gambling market, where casino betting surged 58 percent last
year and 43 percent in the first quarter. The 30 percent win
rate at tables in Vegas in the quarter surpassed the expected
range of 21 percent to 24 percent.  “Business in Las Vegas has improved,” founder and Chief
Executive Officer  Steve Wynn  said today on a conference call.
“From time to time the casino gets a little lucky, and that was
the case this year during Chinese New Year in Las Vegas.”  First-quarter  cash flow , measured as adjusted property
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
climbed 67 percent to $405 million, beating the $309.7 million

percent in the first quarter, with occupancy down 1.5 percentage
