OAO Novolipetsk Steel, owned by
Russian billionaire  Vladimir Lisin , rose the most in almost two
months in Moscow after saying its preliminary results show an
advance in first-quarter sales.  The shares climbed 3.2 percent to 109.48 rubles at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest jump since Feb. 25.  Sales are expected at $2.4 billion for the first quarter,
up 41 percent from $1.7 billion a year earlier, the company said
in a statement today.  “We expect sequential growth in second-quarter sales
volumes as market conditions improve,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
