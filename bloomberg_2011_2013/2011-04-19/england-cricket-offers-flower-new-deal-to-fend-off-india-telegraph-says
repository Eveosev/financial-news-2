England  cricket coach Andy Flower
has been offered a new three-year contract in an attempt to
stave off any moves from  India  to hire him, the Daily Telegraph
reported.  India has Flower on its shortlist to replace coach Gary Kirsten, who left after the April 2 World Cup final win over Sri
Lanka, the newspaper said. Flower is scheduled to meet Hugh
Morris, the managing director of the England team, at the end of
this month to discuss his future and the direction of the
England setup, the newspaper added.  Flower, 42, guided England to two Ashes series wins and the
2010 ICC World Twenty20 title since being appointed in April
2009. The team is currently ranked No. 3 in elite Tests and
fifth in one-day internationals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
