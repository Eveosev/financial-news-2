NewPage Corp. is working with
advisers to help restructure its debt as owner Cerberus Capital
Management LP seeks to fend off distressed investors, including
Apollo Global Management LLC.  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) ,  FTI Consulting Inc. (FCN)  and law firm Dewey &
LeBoeuf LLP are advising Miamisburg, Ohio-based NewPage,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private.  Leon Black ’s Apollo and Avenue Capital Group, run by  Marc Lasry , hold more than $400 million of NewPage’s $806 million of
second-lien bonds, which may be converted to equity if the
company can’t meet debt payments, two of the people said.
NewPage is attempting to cut costs and reduce debt by selling
assets after demand for coated-paper declined since 2008.  “The second-liens are definitely in distressed territory
and indicate a restructuring needs to happen,” said  Rahul Gandhi , an analyst at debt-research firm CreditSights Inc.  Amber Garwood, a spokeswoman for NewPage, and
representatives for Cerberus, Apollo, Avenue, Lazard, FTI and
Dewey & LeBoeuf declined to comment.  NewPage’s 10 percent second-lien notes due May 2012 fell
0.8 cent to 57.4 cents on the dollar as of 9:55 a.m. in  New
York , according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt has declined
3.6 cents since April 15 when NewPage said it was replacing its
chief financial officer. The securities are down from 70 cents
in March, Trace data show.  Paper Demand  The company’s $1.77 billion of 11.375 percent bonds due in
December 2014 dropped to 99.4 cents from 100.75 cents on the
dollar since NewPage announced the management change, Trace data
show.  Volatility will continue in the bonds until Apollo “gets
its chance to force” NewPage “into a restructuring and gain
control of the equity through the process,” London-based Gandhi
wrote in an April 19 report.  NewPage’s capital structure is “stressed” and about $1
billion over-levered, said Ed Sustar, a credit analyst for
Moody’s Investors Service.  “The issue is that overall demand for paper dropped in
2008 and there continues to be a long-term sector decline with
the migration from print to digital,” said Sustar, who is based
in Toronto. “Companies are shutting down mills to keep supply
and demand in balance, but prices are not yet at levels to allow
them to generate enough money to make a profit.”  Cerberus took control of NewPage in 2005 when it bought
MeadWestvaco Corp.’s paper business for $2.3 billion. An
affiliate of Cerberus provided $415 million to NewPage,
according to a statement at the time.  “Cerberus may try to preserve value and appease Apollo and
Avenue through a rights offering for the second-lien,” said
Amer Tiwana, an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “Given that their equity is relatively worthless,
Cerberus’s only way of keeping control may be through ownership
of the second-lien which could be converted into new equity.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
