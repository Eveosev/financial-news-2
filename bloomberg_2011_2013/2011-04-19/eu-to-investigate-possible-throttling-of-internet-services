The European Union’s Internet chief
threatened to ban companies from unfair “blocking or
throttling” of Web traffic if efforts by regulators to ensure
open access to services are shown to fail.  Internet regulators should start “a rigorous fact-finding
exercise” into practices including possible “abusive Internet
traffic management,” the European Commission, the EU’s
executive arm, said in an e-mailed statement today. The move
coincides with  new telecom rules  that come into force across the
27-nation bloc next month.  “If I am not satisfied, I will not hesitate to come up
with more stringent measures,”  Neelie Kroes , the EU
commissioner in charge of the digital agenda, said in the
statement. “If this proves to be insufficient, I am ready to
prohibit the blocking of lawful services or applications.”  Regulatory authorities in the EU’s member nations will be
obliged from May 25 to promote the ability of  Internet users 
“to access and distribute information or run applications and
services of their choice.”  Examples of “blocking” include restrictions by mobile-
phone operators that prevent customers using alternative voice
over Internet services to make phone calls. “Throttling,”
which seeks to reduce Internet traffic congestion, can be abused
to slow down the quality of content such as video streaming
provided by rivals, the  commission  said.  The Brussels-based EU agency plans to publish the results
of the investigation by the Body of European Regulators for
Electronic Communications at the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
