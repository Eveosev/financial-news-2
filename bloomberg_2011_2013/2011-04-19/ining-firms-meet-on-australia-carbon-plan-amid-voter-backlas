Australia ’s government said a group
of mining companies including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto
Group will meet today to suggest changes to Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s plan to introduce carbon trading.  The discussions come amid industry and voter opposition to
the proposal to begin an emissions trading system next July.
Support for the ruling Labor party fell to a 15-year low in a
Nielsen opinion survey published in the Age newspaper yesterday,
which showed 59 percent of voters oppose carbon trading.  Under the system, companies would be charged a fixed cost
per ton of carbon for the first three to five years before
trading begins. The government, which is yet to announce the
starting price, has said more than 50 percent of the carbon
revenue would be used to assist households, with the rest to
help companies adjust and to fund clean energy projects.  A Multiparty Climate Change Committee, proposed by the
Australian Greens, will also meet today in Canberra as Gillard
tries to get support for climate laws. The committee includes
Greens leader  Bob Brown  and his deputy Christine Milne along
with government lawmakers and independents  Tony Windsor  and Rob Oakeshott.  The government needs support from four non-party lawmakers,
including the independents and Greens, to pass laws in
parliament. Windsor told Sky News today he still needed to be
convinced to support the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
