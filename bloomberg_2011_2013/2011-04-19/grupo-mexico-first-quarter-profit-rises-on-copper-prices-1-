Grupo  Mexico  SAB, the countryâ€™s
largest mining company, said first-quarter profit rose 47
percent on increased copper prices and production.  Net income gained to $531.7 million, from $361.9 million in
the year-earlier period, the Mexico City-based company said
today in a statement to the Stock Exchange. Sales climbed 26
percent to $2.5 billion. No per-share figure was given.  Copper futures averaged $4.377 a pound in the quarter, 33
percent higher than in the year-earlier period. Output rose 5.2
percent after the company resumed production at its Buenavista
and Cananea copper mines. Still, the mining group, controlled by
billionaire German Larrea, is grappling with higher electricity
and fuel costs, and the appreciation of the Mexican peso.  Grupo Mexico fell 54 centavos, or 1.4 percent, to 37.4
pesos as of 11:01 a.m. on the Mexico Stock Exchange. The stock
has dropped 11 percent in the past five trading days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
