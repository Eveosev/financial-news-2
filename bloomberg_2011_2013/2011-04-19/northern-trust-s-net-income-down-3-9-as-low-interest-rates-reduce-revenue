Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) , the third-
largest independent U.S. custody bank, said first-quarter profit
fell 3.9 percent as low  interest rates  reduced lending and
money-market revenue.  Net income decreased to $151 million, or 61 cents a share,
from $157.2 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier, the
Chicago-based company said today in a statement. Excluding some
items, analysts had expected earnings of 65 cents, according to
the average of 23 estimates surveyed by Bloomberg.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has held its benchmark lending
rate at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008, cutting the
income Northern Trust earns when investing or lending out
securities and client deposits. Low interest rates also have
forced the company to waive some of the fees it collects for
running money-market funds so that yields stay positive. When
rates are depressed for a long period, more investments and
loans are affected.  Assets under custody rose 17 percent to $4.36 trillion.  The earnings were announced before the start of regular
U.S. trading. Northern Trust lost 6.7 percent this year through
yesterday, including reinvested dividends. The 17-member
 Standard & Poor’s  index of asset managers and custody banks was
little changed.  (Northern Trust is scheduled to hold a conference call for
investors at 9 a.m. New York time. The call can be accessed at
