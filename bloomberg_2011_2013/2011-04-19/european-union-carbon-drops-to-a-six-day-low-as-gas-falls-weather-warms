European Union carbon permits
advanced after reaching their lowest price in six days as
natural gas erased losses.  Carbon futures for December rose 0.9 percent to 16.82 euros
($24.10) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London  as of 5:40 p.m. They declined earlier as low as 16.53
euros. U.K. gas for the six months through September next year,
the summer contract, was little changed after yesterday’s 1.7
percent decline.  Carbon fell 2.6 percent yesterday, its biggest drop in a
month, after Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service revised its long-
term sovereign credit rating outlook for the U.S., the world’s
largest economy, to negative from stable. Power utilities are
buying emission permits as they sell power forward through 2014.  A decision by  Germany  to phase out nuclear power may add
some upside pressure to emission permits this week, said
 Emmanuel Fages  and Carine Hemery, Paris-based analysts for
Orbeo, the carbon venture of Rhodia SA and Societe Generale SA.  “Downside risks will cap the increase of carbon prices,”
which probably won’t move beyond 17.25 euros a ton this week,
they said yesterday in an e-mailed research note. This week’s
minimum should be 16.50 euros, according to Orbeo.  Warmer weather will curb energy demand for heating, Fages
and Hemery said. High temperatures in  Frankfurt  are forecast at
23 degrees Celsius (73 Fahrenheit) tomorrow, compared with a 30-
year median maximum of 14 degrees, according to weather data on
Bloomberg. They will rise as high as 26 degrees on April 21.
London temperatures may be as low as 7 degrees tomorrow,
compared with a median minimum of 5 degrees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
