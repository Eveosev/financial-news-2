Saudi Arabian Airlines said
passenger numbers rose 8.9 percent in the first quarter after
increasing the size of its fleet and adding more flights.  The kingdom’s national carrier, based in Jeddah,  Saudi
Arabia , said in a statement today that it carried 4.54 million
passengers in the first quarter compared with 4.17 million for
the same period a year earlier.  The airline is planning to add more than the 70 planes it
already has on order from  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS as it seeks
to replace older Boeing models to reduce maintenance costs,
Khalid al-Molhem, the airline’s director general, said in an
interview last May.  The carrier said yesterday that 44 new airplanes entered
service in the last 17 months with another five due by the end
of this year. SAA will keep adding planes until the end of 2014
when it should have acquired all 70 of the new airplanes on
order, al-Molhem added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
