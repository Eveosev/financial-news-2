Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  said it’s
restarting units after a  power outage  at the Corpus Christi West
refinery in Texas.  “Units have power again and are restarting, so there
should be no material impact on production,” Steve Lee, a San
Antonio-based spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail
today. The outage was caused by a problem with an off-site
electrical provider, he said.  Flaring associated with the restart was expected to start
today at 4 p.m. local time and last for 24 hours, the company
said in a  filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality. Flaring associated with the outage began at 2:30 p.m.,
according to a separate filing.  The refinery consists of east and west plants a mile apart,
which have a combined capacity of about 315,000 barrels a day,
according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
