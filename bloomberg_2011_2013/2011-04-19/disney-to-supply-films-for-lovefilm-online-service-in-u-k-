Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  agreed to supply
films online to U.K. customers of Lovefilm, the  Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) .-
owned company that operates a subscription-based movie-rental
service in  Europe .  Lovefilm will add more than 50 Disney titles including
“Bedknobs and Broomsticks” and “Dead Poets Society” to
movies it offers online to U.K. subscribers paying 5.99 pounds
($9.74) and up per month, according to a statement today. The
company, which claims 1.6 million customers, also offers DVDs by
mail, like  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  in the U.S., as well as video games.  The Disney agreement also provides Lovefilm with newer
movies like “Tron: Legacy” to offer for a pay-per-view fee,
the company said. Seattle-based Amazon, which acquired Lovefilm
in January, started a  U.S. service to compete with Netflix in
February with 5,000 movies and TV shows. The subscription
service is an add-on to Amazon Instant Video, which offers more
than 90,000 movies and TV shows to buy or rent.  Lovefilm’s U.K. subscribers pay as much as 19.39 pounds a
month for unlimited mail and streaming viewing of films, TV
shows and games. The company also operates in Germany, Sweden,
Denmark and Norway.  Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, fell $1.67 to
$178.34 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares
have lost less than 1 percent this year. Disney, based in
Burbank, California, declined 32 cents to $41.20 on the New York
Stock Exchange and has added 9.8 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
