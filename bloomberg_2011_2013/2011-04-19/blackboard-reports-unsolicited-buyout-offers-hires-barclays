Blackboard Inc. (BBBB) , a maker of online
educational courseware, said it hired Barclays Capital as its
financial adviser after receiving unsolicited buyout offers. The
shares surged 29 percent, the biggest gain since June 2004.  The sources of the buyout offers weren’t disclosed.
Blackboard is evaluating the bids as well as interest from other
potential acquirers, the company said in a statement.  “Our board is committed to fulfilling its fiduciary duties
to act in the best interests of shareholders,” said Chief
Executive Officer Michael Chasen in the statement. “We remain
focused on our company’s strategic plan and are committed to
delivering the highest quality products and sustained client
satisfaction.”  Blackboard makes software that lets teachers post course
materials, conduct discussions and make assignments online. Its
customers include  California State University, Chico , and the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock.  In January,  Pearson Plc (PSON)  paid $127 million to boost its
stake in test-preparation service TutorVista, based in India.
Last November, News Corp. paid $360 million for closely held
Wireless Generation, a maker of Web-based tools for the
classroom.  Blackboard, based in Washington, rose $10.75 to $47.91 at
4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The gain was
the stock’s biggest since June 18, 2004, the day the shares
began trading after an initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
