U.R. Bhat, managing director of
Dalton Capital Advisors India Pvt. in Mumbai, comments on the
forecast for normal monsoon rainfall in the South Asian nation.  Rainfall will be 98 percent of the 50-year average in the
June-September season, a level considered normal, the  India
Meteorological Department  said today after the markets closed.  Bhat spoke in a telephone interview in Mumbai.  “As far as gross domestic product growth is concerned,
agriculture growth is a swing factor. If agriculture growth is
zero or negative then GDP tends to be lower. If agriculture is
higher, GDP swings higher and approaches 9 percent. A good
monsoon is a precursor for good aggregate demand, and therefore
good growth in the economy and the manufacturing sector.”  “Derived demand from agriculture for automobiles, cement
and consumers goods will be higher. If agriculture does well,
then the non-performing assets of lenders will come down.”  “Consumer goods companies are dependent on raw materials,
which mostly come from agriculture. If there’s a bountiful
harvest, they might even be able to maintain their margin and
pass on some of the benefits to consumers.”  The rain forecast may help ease inflationary expectations,
Bhat said. He favors shares of non-state lenders, automakers,
and software and consumer goods companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
