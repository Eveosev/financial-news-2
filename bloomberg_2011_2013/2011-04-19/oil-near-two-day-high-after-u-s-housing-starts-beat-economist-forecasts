Oil advanced for a second day in
 New York , climbing more than $1 a barrel, as signs of an
improving economy in the U.S., the world’s biggest consumer of
crude, stoked speculation demand for fuel may increase.  Futures for June delivery gained as much as 1.2 percent,
extending yesterday’s 0.6 percent increase, before a report
forecast to show an improving U.S. housing market. Oil also rose
as earnings at companies from  Intel Corp . to  South Korea ’s LG
Chem Ltd. bolstered confidence in the economic recovery.  “We could expect more of an upbeat reporting season, and
that may feed through to optimism,” said  Jonathan Barratt ,
managing director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney.  Crude oil for June delivery rose as much as $1.32 to
$109.60 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It was at $109.55 at 9:38 a.m. London time.
Yesterday, it added 59 cents to $108.28, the highest since April
15. The May contract, which expired yesterday, gained $1.03 to
settle at $108.15.  Brent crude  for June settlement climbed
$1.37, or 1.1 percent, to $122.70 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange. Yesterday, it slipped 28 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $121.33.  Purchases of existing U.S. homes climbed 2.5 percent in
March after dropping 9.6 percent in February, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before the National Association of
Realtors report today. A Commerce Department report yesterday
showed work began on 549,000 houses at an annual pace, up 7.2
percent from the prior month and exceeding the 520,000 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Weaker Dollar  The Dollar Index, a measure of the currency versus those of
six U.S. trading partners, slid for a second day to 74.69,
Bloomberg data showed. It is down 5.5 percent since the start of
the year. A decline in the dollar makes commodities priced in
the U.S. currency more attractive for investors.  “The weaker  U.S. dollar  and stronger equities offset
concerns over European sovereign debt and slowing demand from
high  oil prices ,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in
a note today.  U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose 667,000 barrels last week to
356.1 million, according to the industry-funded American
Petroleum Institute. An Energy Department report today may show
supplies increased 1.3 million barrels from 359.3 million,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  Gasoline supplies fell 1.8 million barrels to 212.7 million
and distillate fuels, including diesel, declined 3.4 million
barrels to 146.8 million, the API said.  Housing Starts  The Commerce Department said work began on 549,000 houses
at an annual pace, up 7.2 percent from the prior month and
exceeding the 520,000 median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.6
percent to 1,312.62 at the 4 p.m. close in New York.  Oil traded at the highest since 2008 last week as fighting
in  Libya  threatened to prolong supply cuts from  Africa ’s third
largest producer.  Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa has toppled
leaders in Egypt and Tunisia and spread to Libya, Algeria,
Bahrain, Iran, Oman, Syria and Yemen. Libyan crude output, which
averaged 1.6 million barrels a day last year, shrank to 390,000
barrels a day in March, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
producers, analysts and companies.  Syrian activists said at least 18 protesters have died in
clashes in the three days since President Bashar al-Assad
ordered the Cabinet to make changes aimed at calming dissent.
The government blamed terrorists for the violence, saying a
general and three relatives were killed.  Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan  suspended his interior
minister after protests against his election victory killed at
least six people in Africa’s biggest oil producer. Clashes
between Christians and Muslims broke out for a second day in the
northern city of Kaduna, Shehu Sani, head of the Civil Rights
Congress, said April 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
