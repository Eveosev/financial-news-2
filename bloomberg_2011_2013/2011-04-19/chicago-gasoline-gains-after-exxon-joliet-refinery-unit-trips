Chicago  gasoline strengthened after
Exxon Mobil Corp. had an upset associated with a fluid catalytic
cracker at its Joliet refinery in Illinois.  The unit tripped yesterday because of a mechanical failure,
according to a filing with the Illinois Emergency Management
Agency.  “It was the FCC that was involved in the operational
upset,” said Kevin Allexon, an Exxon spokesman.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 1.5 cents to 3.75 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:50 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
1.39 cents to $3.1864 a gallon.  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  reported a unit upset yesterday at its
Robinson refinery in  Illinois , according to a  filing  with state
regulators.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the Midwest, or Group
3, narrowed its discount 0.63 cent to 9 cents a gallon.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 1 cent to 13.5 cents a gallon. Prompt
delivery fell 3.33 cents to $3.0945 a gallon.  The discount for the same fuel in  New York  Harbor increased
0.5 cent to 9.75 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
