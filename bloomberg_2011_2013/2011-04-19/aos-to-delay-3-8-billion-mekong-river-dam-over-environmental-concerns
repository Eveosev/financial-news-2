Laos agreed to delay construction
of a $3.8 billion hydropower dam because of concerns among
neighboring Mekong River countries that the project would
disrupt fish catches and rice production downstream.  The group “agreed that a decision on the prior
consultation process for the proposed Xayaburi hydropower
project be tabled for consideration at the ministerial level, as
they could not come to a common conclusion on how to proceed
with the project,” it said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
