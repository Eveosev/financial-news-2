Barcelona has appealed a proposed
suspension for  Andres Iniesta  after the midfielder allegedly got
a yellow card on purpose during a recent Champions League match
against  Shakhtar Donetsk .  UEFA’s disciplinary committee will rule on the matter
tomorrow, Barcelona said on its  website . A ban would keep
Iniesta out of next week’s first semifinal game against
archrival Real Madrid.  Iniesta was booked in the first half of the 5-1 opening
quarterfinal game on April 6, earning him a mandatory one-game
ban for the return match, which Barcelona won 1-0. The
midfielder’s disciplinary slate was then wiped clean for the
next game.  “The proposed sanction comes as a result of a report from
UEFA match officials at the game, who have alleged that the
yellow card was deliberately incurred so that the player would
be suspended for the return leg,” Barcelona said on the
website. “FC Barcelona believe that the arguments outlined in
their appeal, based on the good faith of the player and the
disproportionate nature of the proposed sanction, will be
sufficient to rebut these allegations.”  Real  Madrid  hosts the first semifinal game April 27, with
the return match six days later at the Nou Camp Stadium. The
winner will meet Manchester United or Schalke in the final May
28 at London’s Wembley Stadium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
