Japan ’s 10-year bond rose, pushing
yields to the lowest level in three weeks, after a report showed
exports fell for the first time in more than a year.  The nation’s government debt handed investors a 0.6 percent
return in the three months ended yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, outperforming an 11
percent slump in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average during the period.
Investors demanded the lowest 20-year yields in more than a
month relative to five-year rates before a 1.1 trillion-yen ($13
billion) auction of the longer-maturity bonds tomorrow.  “With the outlook still in a haze, we have to be rather
bearish on the economy,” said Toru Suehiro, a market analyst in
 Tokyo  at Mizuho Securities Co., one of the 24 primary dealers
obliged to bid at government debt sales. “Ten-year yields are
likely to try a range of between 1.1 percent and 1.2 percent.”  The benchmark 10-year yield declined one basis point to
1.23 percent at 3:47 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The yield dropped
to as low as 1.225 percent, the least since March 29.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery were unchanged at
139.54 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Twenty-
year yields dropped one basis point to 2 percent. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Japan’s overseas shipments declined 2.2 percent in March
from a year earlier, the  Finance Ministry  said in Tokyo today.
The median estimate of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
was for a 1.1 percent drop.  20-Year Auction  The yield spread between 20-year debt and five-year notes
narrowed to 1.51 percentage points, the least since March 11.  The prior 20-year debt auction on March 16 drew bids valued
at 4.13 times the amount on offer, compared with the average of
3.82 for the past 10 sales. Primary dealers often reduce
holdings of bonds in case prices decline before they can pass on
the new securities to investors.  Bond futures earlier slid as much as 0.16 as Asian stocks
extended gains in global shares. The  Nikkei 225  rose 1.8 percent
after the MSCI World Index advanced 0.6 percent yesterday.  “Bonds are being sold a bit ahead of tomorrow’s auction,
especially after yields dropped rapidly over the past few
days,” said Makoto Noji, a senior debt and foreign-exchange
strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “Stocks also
turned to positive, hurting bonds.”  Ten-year yields are likely to drop to 1.20 percent by the
end of September, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists and analysts. Should the predictions prove accurate,
investors who buy the debt today would make a 0.8 percent return,
Bloomberg calculations showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
