Advertising on mobile devices in
 China  will more than double to $1.16 billion in the next three
years, growing faster than the U.S. market, according to a
report by  EMarketer Inc.   Mobile advertising in China will grow 158 percent by 2014,
EMarketer predicted in a report to be published today. In the
U.S., mobile ad sales will grow 131 percent to $2.55 billion
over the same period, the report said.  Advertisers are boosting spending on text and graphic
display ads for handheld devices in China as portions of the
world’s largest Web market increasingly migrate to mobile
phones. The country will add almost 200 million mobile  Internet
users  over the next three years, bringing the total to 568
million in 2014, according to EMarketer.  “Because mobile devices are often the primary way that
consumers access digital content” in China and other emerging
markets, advertisers enjoy a “heightened appeal relative to a
more mature market, where you have higher PC penetration
rates,” said Noah Elkin, principal analyst at EMarketer in  New
York .  Emerging markets for mobile advertising such as India,
Brazil and Russia are growing at even faster rates than China.
India’s mobile ad spending will total $190 million in 2014, up
more than threefold from this year. Brazil’s mobile ads will
grow almost fivefold to $117 million in the same period. Mobile
advertising in Russia will more than triple to $72 million in
2014.  In the U.S., competition for mobile ad dollars has drawn
large technology companies to make acquisitions in the industry.
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  purchased mobile ad provider AdMob last year for
about $700 million. The same year,  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  acquired Quattro
Wireless, another startup selling ads placed on mobile devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
