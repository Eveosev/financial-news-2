Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and
Liechtenstein’s LGT Group ended talks on the sale of BHF-Bank AG
because LGT feared that BaFin,  Germany ’s financial services
regulator, would veto the transaction, the  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing finance circles.  LGT took insufficient action in the Liechtenstein tax
affair and gave BaFin false information on its use of
foundations to help clients profit from tax advantages, the
newspaper said.  In December, LGT, which is owned by Liechtenstein’s
princely family, and about 45 of its employees settled criminal
proceedings by German prosecutors over charges of abetting  tax
evasion .  To contact the reporter on this story:
