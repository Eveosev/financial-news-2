Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest
U.S. coal producer, said first-quarter profit rose 32 percent on
higher prices for the utility-plant fuel and steelmaking
component.  Net income climbed to $176.5 million, or 65 cents a share,
from $133.7 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier, St. Louis-
based Peabody said today in a statement. The company was
expected to earn 61 cents a share, according to the median of
seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 15
percent to $1.74 billion from $1.52 billion.  Peabody, led by Chief Executive Officer Gregory Boyce, 56,
benefitted from rising metallurgical coal prices and an increase
in shipments. The company’s Australia operations were helped by
higher prices that partly offset the effects of record rains.  Metallurgical prices surged 74 percent to $225 a ton from a
year earlier, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  “Everyone’s got some impact from the floods, but the flip-
side is that on a year-over-year basis, pricing is still
better,” said Jim Rollyson, an analyst in Houston at Raymond
James Financial Inc.  Peabody fell $1.65, or 2.5 percent, to $63.92 yesterday in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
fallen 0.1 percent this year.  Metallurgical coal is used to produce steel, while the
thermal form of the fuel is consumed by utilities to generate
electricity.  Earnings Forecast  Peabody expects to ship between 245 million and 265 million
tons of coal, 28 million to 30 million of which will come from
 Australia , and 195 million to 205 million tons from its U.S.
mines, it said. The remainder will come from its trading and
brokerage operation.  The company said it encountered “difficult geology” at
its Twentymile operation in  Colorado  that reduced output and
that it’s working with the U.S.  Mine Safety and Health
Administration  to develop a new operating plan.  “The range of options could lead to significantly reduced
longwall production from the mine in the quarter,” Peabody
said.  Second-quarter Ebitda will be in a range of $525 million to
$625 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share may range
between 85 cents and $1.10, according to the statement.  For the full year, Peabody said it expects Ebitda to be
$2.1 billion to $2.5 billion, with adjusted diluted earnings per
share of $3.50 to $4.50.  (Peabody scheduled a conference call with analysts and
investors to discuss results at 11 a.m. in  New York . To listen,
