Gold may climb 1.6 percent to a
record $1,520 an ounce in two to four weeks, according to
 technical analysis  from  Barclays Capital .  The level is an initial resistance area and prices may
pause there before extending gains to $1,560 to $1,600 an ounce
in three to six months, Dhiren Sarin, an analyst with Barclays,
said by phone from Singapore today.  “If you look across different markets right now, investor
sentiment is such that they are a little bit risk-averse, so in
that environment gold catches a safe-haven bid,” Sarin said.
“Inflationary expectations” helped push gold higher since the
third quarter of last year, he said.  Gold futures climbed to a record $1,498.60 an ounce
yesterday as Standard & Poor’s revised its U.S. credit-rating
outlook to negative, boosting the metal’s lure as an alternative
to the dollar. Gold jumped 32 percent in the past year and
silver has more than doubled on concern that global inflation
will accelerate and  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis worsen.  Bullion for June delivery gained 0.2 percent to $1,495.8 an
ounce at 6 p.m. Singapore time today on the Comex in  New York .
Support levels are at $1,430 and $1,440 an ounce, Sarin said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A resistance level is where sell
orders may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
