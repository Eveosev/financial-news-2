TPG Capital, the U.S. private-
equity firm that manages $48 billion, said it plans to invest as
much as HK$1.17 billion ($150 million) for a 21 percent stake in
Hong Kong-listed  Comtec Solar Systems Group Ltd. (712)   TPG will buy five-year convertible bonds and warrants in
the Shanghai-based solar wafer maker for HK$780 million and may
invest an additional HK$390 million if the warrants are fully
exercised, according to a statement from the companies today.  Comtec Solar marks TPG’s second acquisition of a China-
focused energy company since October. China, the world’s largest
power consumer, should double its solar targets for 2015 after
the nuclear crisis in  Japan , Li Junfeng, deputy director general
of the Beijing-based Energy Research Institute at the National
Development and Reform Commission, said last week.  Fort Worth , Texas-based TPG agreed in October to buy HK$195
million preferred shares of  Hong Kong Energy Holdings Ltd. (987)  with
an option to buy a further 260 million preferred shares. The U.S.
fund also bought a stake in  China  International Capital Corp. in
December with KKR & Co., and a stake in Wumart Stores Inc.,
Beijing’s biggest supermarket chain, in 2009.  The unsecured, zero-interest convertible bonds can be
converted at HK$3.90 a share in 2016, according to the statement.
TPG will also receive 95 million warrants that give it the right
to additional stock at HK$4.10. Comtec Solar shares fell 2.2
percent to HK$4.06 at 3:04 p.m. local time today.  TPG will own 295 million Comtec shares if the bonds are
fully converted and all warrants exercised, equivalent to 21
percent of the enlarged share capital, according to the
statement. Comtec will use the proceeds from the convertible
bond sale to expand production capacity, it said in the release.  Comtec Solar plans to use the proceeds to boost wafer
production to 1,400 megawatts this year from 1,000 megawatts as
it previously targeted, Chief Executive John Zhang said in a
press conference today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
