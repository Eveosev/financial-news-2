HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) , Europe’s
largest bank by market value, hired  Bertrand Delgado  as an
emerging-markets strategist, luring him away from Roubini Global
Economics LLC.  Delgado, 43, is working in  New York  as a cross-asset
strategist for emerging markets, said Rob Sherman, an HSBC
spokesman. Delgado, who started at HSBC on April 11, reports to
Pablo Goldberg, head of global emerging markets research for
HSBC Global Banking and Markets.  Roubini Global Economics, a consulting firm founded by
Nouriel Roubini, the New York University economist who predicted
the global financial crisis, hired Delgado in 2009 as a senior
economist covering emerging markets.  Delgado previously served as an economist and currency
strategist at the research firm IDEAglobal for three years. He
holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from  University of
Wisconsin  and a master’s degree in international finance and
economics from Columbia University.  Emerging markets from Asia to Latin America accounted for
most of HSBC’s net income last year. Pretax profit in Asia
jumped 26 percent to $11.6 billion in 2010, compared with the
7.3 percent increase to $4.3 billion in Europe, HSBC said in
February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
