Rising commodity prices, which
reflect the shift of economic power from west to east, are a
permanent feature of the global economy, said  Stephen King , the
chief economist at  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   Writing in the Financial Times, he said China and India are
still relatively poor countries; their rapid growth is
associated with high levels of investment and demand for raw
materials.  Historically, European countries met this need through
colonization and slavery, but China and India need other
options, hence Chinaâ€™s negotiation of bilateral agreements with
commodity-rich nations such as Iran, King said.  Western countries need to forge stronger trade links with
emerging ones, supplying products and services appropriate to
aspirational citizens, rather than highly complex and expensive
items, King said.  If advanced countries do that, they can benefit from the
success of the emerging world, he concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
