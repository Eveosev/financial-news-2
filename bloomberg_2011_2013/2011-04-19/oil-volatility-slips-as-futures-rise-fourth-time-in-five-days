Oil options volatility slipped on
the fourth front-month futures increase in five days as
speculation that the  European Central Bank  will further raise
 interest rates  strengthened the euro against the dollar.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.8 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 27.7 percent yesterday.  Oil for May delivery rose $1.03, or 1 percent, to expire at
$108.15 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 33 percent from a year ago. June futures increased 59 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $108.28. The May contract expired at the
close of floor trading today.  The most active contracts in electronic trading were June
$90 puts with 2,381 lots changing hands. They fell 3 cents to 8
cents a barrel. December $200 calls, the next most active
contract, slipped 2 cents to 41 cents a barrel with 2,114
contracts trading. One contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.  May options expired April 14.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $100 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 9,959 lots changing hands. They rose 25
cents to 79 cents a barrel. The next most active option, June
$105 puts, gained 63 cents to $2.13 a barrel on 5,452 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $150 calls with 44,086
contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 43,312 and
