Germany  will regain its place as
the world’s second-biggest goods exporter in 2011 after being
overtaken by the U.S. last year due to exchange-rate movements,
the  Ifo economic institute  said.  “Since the beginning of the year, the dollar has clearly
depreciated vis-a-vis the euro,” Steffen Elstner, an economist
at the Munich-based institute, said in an e-mailed statement
today. “If it remains at this level, Germany, on the basis of
our export forecast, should overtake the U.S. again.”  The euro has gained 7 percent against the dollar this year,
while the global recovery is boosting demand for goods from
 Europe ’s largest economy. German factory orders and exports rose
more than economists forecast in February, indicating economic
growth gathered pace in the first quarter.  Chinese goods exports amounted to $1.58 trillion last year,
Ifo said, followed by the U.S. at $1.28 trillion and Germany at
$1.27 trillion. Calculated in real prices, German goods exports
increased 15 percent in 2010, exceeding the U.S.’s 14.7 percent
gain, according to the  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
