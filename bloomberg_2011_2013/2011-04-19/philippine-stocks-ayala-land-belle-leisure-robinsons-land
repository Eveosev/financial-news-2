had unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the noon close in  Manila .  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 0.6 percent to
4,245.21, snapping a four-day, 1.7 percent rally.  Developers:  Ayala Land Inc. (ALI)  , the largest
developer, sank 3.1 percent to 16.44 pesos, the sharpest loss
since Feb. 22, after central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said
“upside risks to inflation remain” and authorities “will
implement further monetary action as and when necessary.”  Robinsons Land Corp. (RLC)  , the nation’s second-largest
builder of shopping malls, decreased 1 percent to 13.40 pesos.  Belle Corp. (BEL)  , which is building an entertainment
complex in Manila, fell for a fourth day, losing 3.9 percent to
5.38 pesos, the lowest level since March 21. Vice Chairman Willy
Ocier said the company delayed the opening of its casino because
it decided to increase the gaming center’s floor area by 35
percent and to build more facilities.  The company aims to open the casino in the second quarter
of 2012, from the fourth quarter this year previously, Ocier
said.  Leisure & Resorts World Corp. (LR)  , which will operate
the casino, decreased 4 percent to 10.58 pesos, the lowest since
April 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
