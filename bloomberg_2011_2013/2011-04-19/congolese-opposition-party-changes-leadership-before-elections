The political party led by former
Democratic Republic of Congo presidential candidate Jean-Pierre
Bemba, who is under indictment at the  International Criminal
Court , changed its leadership ahead of elections this year.  Thomas Luhaka, a lawmaker, took over as secretary-general
of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo, or MLC, from
Francois Mwamba, who ran the party after Bemba’s transfer to The
Hague, Luhaka said in a phone interview today.  “We need to restructure the party before the upcoming
deadlines for the elections,” Luhaka said from Kinshasa, the
capital. The MLC hasn’t yet decided whether it will nominate its
own presidential candidate or support one from another party in
a vote currently scheduled for November, he said.  Bemba was runner-up to Joseph Kabila in Congo’s 2006
presidential elections, the country’s first in more than four
decades. Supporters of the former rebel leader clashed with
Kabila’s soldiers in the streets of Kinshasa in 2007, leaving
hundreds dead. Bemba is facing charges at the ICC of leading
militias who murdered and raped civilians in neighboring Central
African Republic in 2002 and 2003. He has pleaded not guilty.  The MLC informed Bemba of the leadership change “and he is
in agreement,” Luhaka said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
