International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , the world’s largest computer-services provider, boosted
its full-year profit forecast as companies buy more software and
equipment.  Operating earnings will be at least $13.15 a share this
year, higher than a previous projection of at least $13 and the
$13.08 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
First-quarter services signings fell 14 percent from a year
earlier, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today, erasing a gain
in the shares in extended trading.  The contract signings were “a blemish,” although they
aren’t a good indicator of future revenue, said Chris Whitmore,
an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in  San Francisco  who recommends
buying the stock. For the first quarter, IBM reported “a solid
revenue beat, driven by improvement in services and strength in
hardware.”  Sales last quarter climbed 7.7 percent to $24.6 billion,
topping projections, as software, hardware and services revenue
jumped. Equipment sales climbed for the fifth straight quarter
as customers continued to upgrade after IBM released its Power7
server-computer system and a new mainframe last year.  IBM slid $4 to $161.40 at 6:17 p.m. after rising to $170 in
extended trading. Before the earnings’ release, the stock fell
54 cents to $165.40 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 13 percent this year.  ‘Volatile’ Signings  Signings -- the value of new contracts signed during a
specific quarter -- declined to $10.5 billion. It’s the fourth
time in five quarters that a drop in new contract signings
overshadowed an improved profit forecast.  The signings figure is “volatile” and not as accurate a
predictor of sales as the backlog, which includes contracts
accumulated over time, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said on a conference call today. Backlog climbed 5.6 percent to
$142 billion last quarter.  First-quarter net income rose 10 percent to $2.86 billion,
or $2.31 a share, from $2.6 billion, or $1.97, a year earlier.  Profit on an operating basis was $2.41 a share, compared
with analysts’ average estimate of $2.30. This is the first year
IBM is reporting on an operating format, which excludes
acquisition and some retirement costs.  Hardware sales climbed 19 percent to $4.02 billion, the
largest jump of any segment. Software revenue rose 5.8 percent
to $5.31 billion. Sales from emerging markets, which IBM expects
to make up almost 30 percent of revenue in 2015, advanced 18
percent.  Gross profit margin expanded to 44.1 percent last quarter,
from 43.6 percent a year earlier. The company had about $220
million in workforce restructuring costs, Loughridge said.  ‘Limited’  Japan  Effect  IBM, which gets about 11 percent of its sales from Japan,
saw a limited effect from last month’s earthquake, Loughridge
said on the call. The company’s infrastructure in the country,
which is in “very good shape,” had about $20 million in
damages. The company doesn’t expect “appreciable impact” on
its supply chain, he said.  Operating earnings will be at least $20 a share in 2015,
IBM said last month, reiterating a forecast from a year ago.  The company is investing in cloud-computing and analytics-
software businesses, which the company predicts will generate $7
billion and $16 billion in revenue, respectively, by 2015. Those
initiatives, along with investments in emerging markets and
Smarter Planet -- IBM’s plan to digitize physical infrastructure
-- will help add on about $20 billion in sales through 2015, the
company said last month.  Chief Executive Officer  Sam Palmisano  also plans to make
about $20 billion in acquisitions in the same period, a
projection he first gave last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
