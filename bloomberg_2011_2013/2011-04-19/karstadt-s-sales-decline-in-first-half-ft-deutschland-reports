Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH’s sales
fell in the first half of the company’s business year by almost
4 percent to 1.78 billion euros ($2.6 billion),  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing documents it obtained.  The figures are not adjusted for the closure of 13
department stores, and a Karstadt spokesman said the results had
been expected, and the company had planned accordingly, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
