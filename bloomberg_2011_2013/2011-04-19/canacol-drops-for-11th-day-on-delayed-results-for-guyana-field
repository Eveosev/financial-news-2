Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE) , the Calgary-
based  oil company  that operates fields in  South America , headed
toward the lowest closing price in seven months on delayed
results of drilling at an exploratory well in Guyana.  The shares fell for the 11th consecutive day, sinking 1.7
percent to 2,320 pesos in Bogota trading at 12:40 p.m. New York
time. A close at that level would be the lowest since Sept. 30.  The company continues to drill and test the Apoteri K-2
well in Guyana, Kevin Flick, head of  investor relations  for the
company, said in a phone interview. Exploration began in
December and was interrupted in January because of the late
arrival of some equipment, according to a statement March 7.
Canacol hasn’t given further details on plans for a second well
in the Takutu block, which had been slated for next month.  “The stock is probably being hit due to a lack of
information about that project,” said Santiago Melo, an analyst
at brokerage Alianza Valores SA in Bogota. “The Colombian
market has also been weak in general, but Canacol is out of the
ordinary.”  Flick said Canacol will release information about the well
as soon as possible.  “Until drilling and testing is done, I’ve been instructed
to stay quiet,” he said. “I realize the market is skittish
with the stock.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
