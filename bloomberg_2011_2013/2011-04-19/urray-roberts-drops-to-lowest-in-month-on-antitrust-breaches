Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) , a
construction company, extended declines to the lowest intraday
level in a month after saying it may have transgressed  South
Africa ’s antitrust laws.  The shares slipped 44 cents, or 1.7 percent to 24.84 rand
at 9:29 a.m. in Johannesburg. That is the lowest level since
March 17 and follows yesterday’s 4.4 percent loss.  Murray & Roberts identified a “relatively small number”
of projects in which its executives transgressed the Competition
Act, necessitating an application for leniency with the
Competition Commission of South Africa, the company said
yesterday in a regulatory statement.  The commission may levy fines equivalent to a maximum 10
percent of the revenue in the offending business unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
