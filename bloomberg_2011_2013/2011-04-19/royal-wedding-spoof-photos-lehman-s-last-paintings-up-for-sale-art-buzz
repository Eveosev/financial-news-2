London  art dealer Ben Brown puts
photos of the Royal Wedding up for sale today. In one,  Prince William  is leading a conga dance, followed by his bride Kate and
 Elton John . In another, the happy couple cut the cake while
Corgi dogs forage for food and  Queen Elizabeth  looks bored.  The spoofs of the April 29 wedding feature lookalikes
photographed by  Alison Jackson , who has fooled many people with
her paparazzi-style photos of celebrity doppelgangers, often in
compromising situations.  “This is a last-minute pop-up event,” gallery director
Brown said. “It’s poignant to exhibit these before the
wedding.”  Large photographs, from editions of three, will be priced
at 15,000 pounds ($24,480). Smaller images, issued in editions
of five, will start at 2,500 pounds.  The “Up the Aisle” show runs through May 7 at  Ben Brown 
Fine Arts, 12 Brook’s Mews, London W1K 4DG. Information: +44-20-

today got one more chance to buy artworks from the corporate
collection of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)   Edinburgh auction house  Lyon & Turnbull  offered 22
contemporary pieces from the bankrupt bank’s European offices
with a total estimate of as much as 47,000 pounds at hammer
prices. The sale raised 45,425 pounds with fees. Six of the lots
failed to sell.  Many of the works on offer were large scale, Nick Curnow,
Lyon & Turnbull’s managing director, said. Estimates ranged from
300 pounds to 8,000 pounds.  The top lot was the 2006 photographic piece, “Picture Made
by Hand With the Assistance of Light,” by the U.K.-born artist
 Walead Beshty , who now lives in  Los Angeles . This sold for
18,750 pounds, beating a high estimate of 8,000 pounds. The
work, which is 6 feet (1.8 meters) high, was made by bending
photographic paper into a sculpture and then exposing it to
light.  A 2001 watercolor of a landscape seen through prison bars
by the German painter Guenther Foerg sold for 1,875 pounds,
below an estimate of 3,000 pounds.  Once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank,  New York- 
based Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on
Sept. 15, 2008, with assets of $639 billion. More than $830
billion in claims have been filed against Lehman, which has said
many are duplicates.  Sales at  Freeman’s Auctioneers  in Philadelphia,  Sotheby’s (BID) 
in  New York  and Christie’s International in London raised $1.35
million, $12.3 million and 1.6 million pounds, respectively, for
creditors in 2009 and 2010.  Pearson Family  Paintings and antiques belonging to members of the family
that founded media group  Pearson Plc (PSON)  are expected to fetch at
least 10 million pounds in auctions this summer.  Lord Cowdray will be offering five British portraits at
Christie’s International’s July 5 London auction of Old Master
paintings.  Thomas Gainsborough’s “Portrait of Miss Read, Later Mrs.
William Villebois,” is estimated at a record 4 million pounds
to 6 million pounds. A further 1,000 lots -- including pieces
from  Dunecht , the Scottish home of Lord Cowdray’s brother,
Charles Pearson -- will be auctioned at Cowdray Park, West
Sussex, on Sept. 13-15, the London-based auction house said
today in an e-mailed statement.  A 1611 portrait of the Countess of Hertford may fetch 1.5
million pounds. Lord Cowdray will also be selling silver valued
at more than 1 million pounds at Christie’s London on July 7.  Cowdray Park , which is now itself up for sale for 25
million pounds, was acquired by Weetman Dickinson Pearson, the
first Lord Cowdray, a Yorkshire-born engineer and oil magnate,
in 1908. The present family is moving to a more manageable house
on the estate, said Christie’s.  “This is the most important group of British portraits to
come on the market for 50 years,” the London-based dealer  Mark
Weiss  said. “The collection was put together in the 1920s and
’30s when a lot of country houses were being sold and the rich
were able to Hoover up the best things.”  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
