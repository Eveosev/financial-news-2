Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund, known
as Sofaz, increased 13 percent in the first quarter as fuel
prices rose.  Assets rose to $25.8 billion as of April 1 from $22.8
billion at the start of the year, Sofaz said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Sales of oil and natural gas from the ACG and Shah Deniz
projects in the  Caspian Sea , led by  BP Plc (BP/) , provided the bulk of
the fund’s wealth, Shahmar Movsumov, the head of the fund, told
reporters today in Baku, the capital.  Sofaz said about 55.3 percent of its investment portfolio
is in U.S. dollars, 39.7 percent is in euros, and almost 5.1
percent is in pounds, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
