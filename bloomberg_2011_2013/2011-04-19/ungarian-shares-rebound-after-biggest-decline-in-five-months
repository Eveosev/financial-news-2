Hungarian shares rebounded from
their biggest retreat in five months after global markets
dropped yesterday as  Standard & Poor’s  revised the U.S.
government’s long-term credit-rating outlook to negative.  The benchmark BUX index added 1.4 percent to 23,600.7 by
the 5 p.m. close in Budapest. It fell 3.8 percent yesterday, the
most since Nov. 10. OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest lender,
gained 2.3 percent to 6,080 forint. The forint strengthened 0.8
percent to 265.82 per euro.  S&P cited concern the White House and Congress will fail
to reach agreement on cutting medium- and long-term debt,
threatening the country’s top AAA rating. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index of equities, which fell 1.7 percent yesterday as
investors pared holdings of risky assets, rose 0.4 percent
today.  “The general view is that the rating downgrade can be
avoided, a deal will be struck,” Zoltan Reczey, an analyst at
Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt. in Budapest, said in a telephone
interview today. “The negative reaction from the markets was
natural but it only generated a temporary deterioration in
sentiment. There is a rebound from yesterday’s panic.”  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said in a Bloomberg
Television interview today he’s confident U.S. political leaders
will bridge their differences and move toward a long-term plan
to narrow record budget deficits and reduce the debt. U.S.
stocks rebounded from the biggest drop in a month today as
results beat analysts’ estimates at companies from Johnson &
Johnson to Burberry Group Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
