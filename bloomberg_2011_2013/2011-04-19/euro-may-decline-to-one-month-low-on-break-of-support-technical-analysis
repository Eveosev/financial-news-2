The euro may decline to a one-month
low against the dollar after dropping below two levels of so-
called major support yesterday, Forecast Pte said, citing
trading patterns.  The single currency slid below $1.4275, which was on an
ascending trend line connecting the lows of Jan. 10, March 11
and April 1, and it also dropped past $1.4267, which was the 20-
day moving average, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.
Daily momentum indicators such as the moving average
convergence/divergence, or MACD, also suggest the euro will fall,
said Pak Lai Ng, a technical analyst at Forecast in  Singapore .  “The euro is in a corrective downtrend,” Ng said. “The
first downside target would likely be the $1.40 level,” he said,
referring to the March 28 low of $1.4021 and the 50-day moving
average of $1.4003.  The euro traded at $1.4231 as of 9:33 a.m. in  Tokyo  after
falling to $1.4158 yesterday, the lowest level since April 5.
The last time the currency traded at $1.40 was on March 18. The
common currency has weakened 2 percent since reaching a 15-month
high of $1.4520 on April 12 and 13.  The MACD for the euro was 0.0104 today, below the so-called
signal line of 0.0125, Bloomberg data show. A reading below the
signal line indicates the currency will weaken.  MACD is a gauge of momentum and is calculated by
subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average from the 12-
day average. The signal line is a nine-day exponential moving
average of the MACD, and provides buy and sell signals. Support
is where buy orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
