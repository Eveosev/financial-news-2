Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  is scheduled to begin
restarting a reformer at its Philadelphia refinery tomorrow
after maintenance, according to a person with knowledge of the
work.  Repairs have also been completed on a joint associated with
a fluid catalytic cracker that was damaged during a flange fire
April 13 at the plant, according to the person, who declined to
be identified because the information isn’t public. The unit
hasn’t returned to service yet, the person said.  The reformer and associated units were shut in mid-March
for work, according to the person.  Joe McGinn, a spokesman for the company, declined to
comment on operations.  The Sunoco refinery has a capacity of 355,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
