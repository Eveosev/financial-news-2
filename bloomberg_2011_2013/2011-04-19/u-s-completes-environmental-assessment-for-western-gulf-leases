The U.S. completed a draft
environmental assessment for an oil and gas lease sale as soon
as this year in the western  Gulf of Mexico , the  Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement  said.  The analysis includes information collected after  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
oil spill last year, the agency said today in an e-mail. It will
be updated to reflect comments gathered at hearings in May,
according to the agency.  The sale of leases off the Texas and Louisiana coasts is
tentatively scheduled for late 2011, the regulator said.  “We’re glad to see this positive step forward,” said Erik
Milito, the American Petroleum Institute’s director of upstream
and industry operations. “We hope it will allow  Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management  to proceed with plans for a lease sale later
in 2011.”  The institute, the industry’s largest trade group, had
expressed concerns that the environmental reviews after the BP’s
record offshore spill might push the lease sales into 2012 or
later.  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management also issued a permit
for  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  to drill in the Alaminos Canyon of the
Gulf. The well will be the 11th in deep water since exploration
resumed after the BP disaster, the agency said today on its
website. The permit was approved yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
