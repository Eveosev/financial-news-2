Serbian inflation should start
slowing in the third quarter, reaching the central bank’s target
range in the first half of next year, policy makers said today.  Food costs have fueled consumer prices, which rose at an
annual rate of 14.1 percent in March, the biggest jump since
June 2008, the Belgrade-based  Narodna Banka Srbije  said today in
a letter to the government. Inflation has exceeded the central
bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target for six consecutive months.  “The pace of bringing inflation down toward the target
will largely depend on the success of the 2011-2012 farming
season,” the central bank said in the letter on its website.  The National Bank of  Serbia  raised its benchmark interest
rate to 12.5 percent, the highest in  Europe , from 8 percent over
the past eight months to curb prices. The bank said it expects
the rate increases to begin slowing inflation in coming months,
and it will “assess in the coming period if any additional
tightening is necessary.” The bank holds its next rate-setting
meeting on May 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
