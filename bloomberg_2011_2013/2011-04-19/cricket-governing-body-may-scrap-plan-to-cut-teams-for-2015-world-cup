Cricket’s governing body will
consider reversing its decision to limit participants for the
2015  World Cup  to its 10  full members  after complaints from
national associations.  The International Cricket Council’s executive board voted
earlier this month to reduce the event’s participants to only
the 10 Test-playing members. The 2011 World Cup, won by  India  on
April 2, had the 10 teams and four lower-ranked squads that
don’t play the longer form of the game.  While none of the lower-ranked nations made it to the
quarterfinals, Ireland had one of the biggest upsets in World
Cup history. It beat England after chasing down a record victory
target of 327. The other second-tier members at the tournament
were Canada, Kenya and the Netherlands.  “I have given this matter further serious thought and will
request the board consider this topic once more,” ICC President
 Sharad Pawar  said in a statement. “I can understand the views
of the associates and affiliates and ICC will seek to deal with
this issue in the best way possible.”  The ICC said a final decision about the composition of the
teams for the tournament in  Australia  will be taken at its
annual conference in  Hong Kong  in June.  It also agreed to have a 10-team competition at the 2019
World Cup in England, although it’s unclear whether that will
change. The ICC had said participants for that event would be
determined through the results of qualification matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
