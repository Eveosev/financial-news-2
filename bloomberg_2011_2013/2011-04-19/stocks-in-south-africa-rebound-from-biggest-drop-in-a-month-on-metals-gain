South African stocks rebounded from
the biggest drop in a month as copper rose, boosting mining
companies including  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL) , and as  SABMiller Plc (SAB) 
reported sales that beat estimates.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index snapped two days of
losses, adding 1.4 percent to 31,837.06 at the 5 p.m. close of
trading in Johannesburg. The gauge declined 2.6 percent
yesterday after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S.’s long-term
credit outlook to negative and commodity prices fell.  “What you’re seeing is the paring of yesterday’s losses
following the aggressive selloff,” sSobantu Modise, an equities
trader at Metropolitan Asset Management in  Cape Town , said in a
phone interview. “The commodity story is still real.”  Copper snapped six days of losses, rising as much as 1.8
percent to $9,393 a metric ton in  London , after Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc. said it suspended operations at a mine in
Indonesia. Builders in the U.S. broke ground on 549,000 homes at
an annual pace in March, beating the 520,000 median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  BHP Billiton , the world’s largest mining company, gained
for the first time in three days, rising 1.1 percent to 276.25
rand.  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , a diversified mining company that
makes up 11 percent of the measure, advanced 2.9 percent to
342.70 rand, paring yesterday’s 4.6 percent decline.  SABMiller, the world’s second-biggest brewer by volume,
advanced after reporting fourth-quarter beer sales rose 3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
