Ineos Group Holdings Plc reported
an upset at the ethylene unit at its Chocolate Bayou chemical
plant in Alvin,  Texas , according to a filing with state
regulators.  “The olefins 1 unit experienced an upset when the p-rich
feed was lost to two of the furnaces resulting in flaring off
spec ethylene product,” Ineos said a  filing  with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.  “Operations stabilizing the unit to bring ethylene product
back on spec and decreased feed to the furnaces,” the
Lyndhurst, United Kingdom-based company said in the filing.  The Chocolate Bayou plant includes two olefins units and
has one of the largest hydrocarbon crackers in the U.S.,
according to the company  website . The plant is located in Alvin,
about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Houston.  To contact the reporters on this story:
