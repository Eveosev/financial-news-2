Deutsche Bahn AG, which bought
Arriva Plc for 1.5 billion pounds a year ago, may spend 2
billion pounds ($3.3 billion) on acquisitions and contracts in
the next three years and aims to grow to “three or four times”
its present size in five years, the Financial Times reported,
citing Arriva Chief Executive Officer  David Martin .  The group may be interested in bidding for five U.K. rail
franchises in the next 18 months, including the state-owned East
Coast service, as well as for contracts in  Europe  and the Middle
East, the FT said, citing Martin, who is responsible for the
combined group’s expansion outside Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
