Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  advanced after U.S. housing starts increased and
earnings beat estimates at companies including Johnson & Johnson,
signaling the world’s biggest economy is recovering.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, rose 0.7 percent from the closing share
price yesterday in Tokyo. Those of Advantest, Japan’s largest
maker of chip-testing equipment, gained 0.9 percent after Intel
Corp. forecast quarterly sales that may top estimates. ADRs of
 Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s No. 2 oil producer, climbed
0.5 percent in Sydney as crude prices gained.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,495 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,440
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,500 in
 Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index rose 0.7 percent today.  “You’re seeing signs the U.S. and Europe are still on
track for recovery,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager
in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “That’s helped to ease
nerves.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.1 percent
today. In New York, the index advanced 0.6 percent yesterday
after the Commerce Department said housing starts increased 7.2
percent in March from the previous month. Work began on 549,000
homes, exceeding the 520,000 median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Results Top Estimates  Companies in the U.S. and Europe also reported results that
beat projections, helping boost confidence in the global
recovery.  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the biggest chipmaker, forecast second-
quarter sales that may top analysts’ estimates as demand for
processors for high-powered machines that handle Web services
overcame slower personal computer growth.  Johnson & Johnson, the world’s second-biggest seller of
health products, forecast full-year earnings $4.90 to $5 a share,
better than an outlook for $4.80 to $4.90 in January, boosted by
new drugs.  Japan’s currency also weakened, giving a relief to the
country’s exporters. The yen depreciated to as low as 118.44
against the euro today in Tokyo, compared with 117.24 at the
close of stock trading yesterday on speculation the  European
Central Bank  will raise interest rates further. Against the
dollar, Japan’s currency weakened to 82.76 last night from 82.44.  Commodity producers were boosted by higher crude and metal
prices. Crude oil for May delivery gained $1.03 to settle at
108.15 a barrel yesterday in New York. The London Metal Exchange
Index of six metals including copper and aluminum increased 1
percent, the biggest gain in almost two weeks.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.4 percent by the  S&P
500  and drops of 0.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500
and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
