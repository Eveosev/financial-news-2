OAO Russian Railways approved plans
to sell 75 percent minus two shares of its OAO Freight One unit
and 25 percent plus one share of OAO TransContainer, said Deputy
Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov, the state-owned company’s
chairman.  The rail monopoly seeks at least 115.5 billion rubles
($4.1 billion) and 10.7 billion rubles for the stakes in Freight
One and TransContainer, respectively, Zhukov told reporters
today in Moscow, adding that Freight One will be auctioned off
in the third quarter. The company’s board approved the plans
today. It would keep about 25 percent in each unit after the
sales.  In October, Russian Railways CEO Vladimir Yakunin said in
an interview with Vedomosti newspaper that Globaltrans
Investment Plc and companies affiliated with billionaires
 Vladimir Lisin  and Gennady Timchenko were potential buyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
