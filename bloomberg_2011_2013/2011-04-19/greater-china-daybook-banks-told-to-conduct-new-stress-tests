China ’s banking regulator  Liu
Mingkang  told the nation’s commercial banks to start a new round
of stress tests on their property loans. Banks should strengthen
the management of property lending and credit to local
government financing vehicles, Liu said after a meeting of th
China Banking Regulatory Commission, according to a statement
posted on the agency’s website.  Yuan forwards strengthened the most in a week after
People’s Bank of China adviser Xia Bin said China will not rule
out a one-off revaluation of the currency. In an interview
published on the Sina.com website, Xia also said China should
widen the yuan’s trading band.  China Vanke Co., the country’s biggest developer by market
value, said its first-quarter net income rose 7 percent from a
year earlier to 1.21 billion yuan ($185 million). The impact of
the government’s curbs on the real-estate industry is “clear”
as transactions in the market have slowed, the company said in a
statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
