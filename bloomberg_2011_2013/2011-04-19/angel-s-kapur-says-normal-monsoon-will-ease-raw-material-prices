Chitrangda Kapur, an analyst at
Angel Broking Ltd., comments on  consumer goods  companies and
stock market after the  India Meteorological Department  forecast
a normal monsoon rainfall for a second year for the country, the
world’s second-biggest producer of sugar, rice and cotton.  Rainfall will be 98 percent of the 50-year average in the
June-September season, the weather bureau said in a statement
today in  New Delhi . The bureau defines normal precipitation as
96 percent to 104 percent of the long-term average.  Kapur spoke in a phone interview from her office in Mumbai.  On raw material prices:  “Normal monsoons will increase the farm output, including
certain key raw material prices, which will help tame the food
inflation and help ease out the inflationary pressures that most
of the consumer goods companies are facing.  ‘‘It will also increase the income for rural  India , which
comprises almost two-third of the country’s population. That
will trigger demand not only for consumer goods, but also other
sectors like automobile and farm equipment.  ‘‘Overall it is very good news, which should reflect in the
market and it will drive positive sentiment.’’  In the consumer goods sector, stocks like Dabur India Ltd.,
Britannia Industries Ltd. and Nestle India Ltd. may react
positively immediately to this news as these companies have a
huge rural population to cater and they also use a lot of
agriculture commodities as raw materials, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
