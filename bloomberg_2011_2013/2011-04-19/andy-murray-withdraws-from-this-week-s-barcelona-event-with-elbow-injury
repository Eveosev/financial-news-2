Andy Murray , the fourth-ranked
men’s tennis player, withdrew from this week’s clay-court
tournament in Barcelona because of an elbow injury, he said on
his website.  The Scot was given a cortisone injection during his
semifinal loss against top-ranked Rafael Nadal at the  Monte
Carlo Rolex Masters  three days ago. He will now take four to
five days’ rest following advice from medical experts.  Murray had reached the last four on the clay courts of
Monte Carlo following a slump in form after losing to second-
ranked Novak Djokovic of Serbia in the final of the Australian
Open in January.  The 23-year-old lost his opening rounds in tournaments in
Rotterdam,  Indian Wells ,  California , and Miami, all to lower-
ranked players. His form improved in Monte Carlo, where Murray
took a set off eventual seven-time champion Nadal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
