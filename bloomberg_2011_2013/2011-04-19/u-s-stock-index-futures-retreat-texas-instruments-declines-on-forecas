U.S. stocks rose, as benchmark
indexes rebounded from the worst declines in a month, after
housing starts increased and earnings beat estimates at
companies from Johnson & Johnson to  Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD)   A gauge of homebuilders in S&P indexes gained 2.2 percent
as all of its 12 stocks advanced. Johnson & Johnson, the second-
biggest seller of health products, rallied 3.7 percent, the most
in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average . Steel Dynamics added 5.7
percent as its profit also beat projections. Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc. rose 2.2 percent, pacing gains in raw-
material producers, as gold touched a record $1,500.50 an ounce.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.6 percent to
1,312.62 at 4 p.m. in New York. Yesterday, the benchmark gauge
slid 1.1 percent as S&P Ratings Service cut the long-term U.S.
credit outlook. The Dow average advanced 65.16 points, or 0.5
percent, to 12,266.75 today.  “Buy the dips, sell the rips,” said Burt White, who helps
oversee $284 billion as chief investment officer at LPL
Financial Corp. in  Boston . “This market has been very
resilient. Things are better than people think as far as the
economy goes. Today’s housing numbers were pretty good. You’ve
got a bellwether such as  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  coming out with good
news. The market is excited to see that.”  Corporate Profits  The S&P 500 has risen 4.4 percent in 2011, extending last
year’s 13 percent rally, amid government stimulus measures and
corporate earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. Earnings-per-
share beat analysts’ estimates at about 76 percent of the 33
companies in the S&P 500 that reported results since April 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges,
compared with the average over the past 50 days of 7.6 billion,
as trading slowed for the Passover holiday.  Stock futures extended gains before the open of regular
trading as Commerce Department figures showed that work began on
549,000 houses at an annual pace, up 7.2 percent from the prior
month and exceeding the 520,000 median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Starts fell 19 percent in February
to the lowest level in almost two years.  Homebuilders rallied. PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue, gained 5.1 percent to $8.24.  Lennar
Corp. (LEN)  added 2.5 percent to $18.79.  “The economy is in a sustainable recovery,” said  Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist at Raymond James & Associates
in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida , who helps manage $275 billion. “The
market is trading on fundamentals. Earnings are going to
continue to surprise on the plus side.”  Record Streak  Investors counting on a record streak of higher-than-
forecast profits to keep driving share prices may get clues from
79 companies reporting this week with the best history of
earnings surprises.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , maker of the iPhone, and  General Electric Co. (GE) ,
the world’s biggest builder of  jet engines , are among companies
that have topped analysts’ projections in the last four quarters
and had estimates boosted since February, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  S&P 500  companies will probably report
average net income growth of 10 percent in the period, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “You can call it momentum, progress or improvement, but
there’s always interest in companies that can do better and
better each quarter, come up with something new, pull a rabbit
out of the hat,” said John Carey, a Boston-based  money manager 
at Pioneer Investments, which oversees about $250 billion. “At
the same time, there were some unusual, striking events in the
first quarter that upset and distracted investors.”  Earnings  Companies in the S&P 500 have beaten analyst earnings
estimates for eight straight quarters, the most since at least
2006, helping propel the index as much as 99 percent from the
market bottom on March 9, 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Johnson & Johnson rallied 3.7 percent to $62.69. Earnings
excluding one-time items of $1.35 topped the $1.26 average
estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. J&J forecast
full-year earnings of $4.90 to $5 a share, more than an outlook
for $4.80 to $4.90 in January as results were boosted by new
drugs and a weaker dollar. Twenty-one analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg estimated an average of $4.85.  A gauge of raw-material producers had the biggest gain in
the S&P 500 within 10 industries, rallying 1.8 percent. Gold
futures for June delivery rose $2.20, or 0.1 percent, to settle
at $1,495.10 an ounce in  New York  after topping $1,500 during
the day.  Debt Concerns  U.S. debt concerns weighed on the dollar, boosting demand
for the precious metal as an alternative investment. The
greenback dropped against the euro on speculation that the
 European Central Bank  will continue to raise borrowing costs
even as some nations struggle to contain sovereign debt.  Steel Dynamics climbed 5.7 percent to $18.46. The producer
of the metal posted a first-quarter profit of 46 cents a share,
exceeding the average analyst estimate by 5 cents.  Zions Bancorporation rose 3.9 percent to $23.85. The Salt
Lake City-based bank reported first-quarter profit of 9 cents a
share, excluding certain items. Analysts had estimated a loss of
15 cents a share on average.  Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG)  declined 5.3 percent to $37.61. The
biggest U.S. motorcycle maker reported first-quarter earnings
from continuing operations were 51 cents a share, missing the
55-cent average estimate by analysts.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  fell 1.3 percent to $151.86. The
fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  was cut to “neutral” from “buy” at
Rochdale Securities LLC.  Goldman posted a 21 percent drop in first-quarter profit, a
smaller decline than analysts estimated, as fixed-income trading
revenue more than doubled from a weak fourth quarter. Net income
fell to $2.74 billion from $3.46 billion a year earlier, Goldman
Sachs said in a statement. Earnings per share, which includes
the cost of preferred dividend payments to  Warren Buffett ’s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., dropped to $1.56 from $5.59. The
average estimate of analysts was for 81 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
