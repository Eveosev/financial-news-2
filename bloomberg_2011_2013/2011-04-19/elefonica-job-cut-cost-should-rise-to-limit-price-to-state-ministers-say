Telefonica SA (TEF)  and other profitable
Spanish companies should pay more costs when they eliminate
jobs, reducing the burden on state benefits, Finance Minister
Elena Salgado said.  “Any profitable company will have the right to reorganize
itself but that same company must bear the cost,” Salgado said
in a radio interview with  Cadena Ser  today. She was responding
to a question about Madrid-based Telefonica, which has said it
plans to cut about 20 percent of its workforce in  Spain  within
the next three years as it targets growth in Latin America to
make up for declining sales at home.  Profitable companies such as Telefonica, Spain’s former
phone monopoly, should contribute to the costs borne by the
state unemployment-protection system, Labor Minister Valeriano Gomez said yesterday in an interview with state-owned radio
station  RNE . Telefonica’s job cuts aren’t appropriate for a
socially responsible company as it also announced a
multimillion-euro bonus plan for senior executives, Gomez said.  “When a company of a sufficient size has a sufficiently
high level of profit and carries out job cuts that include
firings with the use of  unemployment benefits , the company
should contribute to reducing the cost to the unemployment-
protection system, with the company itself paying the cost of
the unemployment benefit,” Gomez said.  -- with assistante from Emma Ross-Thomas. Editors: Robert Valpuesta, David Risser.  To contact the reporters on this story:
