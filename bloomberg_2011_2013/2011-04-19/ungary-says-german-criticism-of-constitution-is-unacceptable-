German criticism of  Hungary ’s newly
adopted constitution was rejected as “baffling and
unacceptable,” by the Hungarian foreign ministry.  Remarks by Werner Hoyer, German deputy foreign minister,
“evaluate an internal political matter,” the ministry said in
a statement on its  website  today. It said the German government
was briefed several times on the constitutional plans.  The constitution, approved by parliament in the face of
protests and a boycott by two opposition parties, adds to
concerns about the policies of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s
government, particularly on minority rights, Hoyer said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. Fears fueled by the adoption of a
controversial media law have been sharpened, he said.  The ministry said the constitution strengthens minority
rights and reinforces rather than curbs the rule of law. It’s
“especially unacceptable” that Hoyer’s statement refers to the
media law, which the government modified in line with European
Union requirements, the ministry said.  Orban, who won a two-thirds majority in parliament last
year, says the constitution completes the transition to
democracy that began after the collapse of communism. Opponents
claim it amounts to a “constitutional coup.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
