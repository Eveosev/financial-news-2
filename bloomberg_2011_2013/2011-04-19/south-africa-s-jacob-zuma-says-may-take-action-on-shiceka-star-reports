South Africa ’s President  Jacob Zuma 
said allegations reported in the media that Sicelo Shiceka,
minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs,
misused public funds are “too serious,” Johannesburg’s Star
newspaper reported.  “There will be no hesitation if these things that are
being said are true,” he said in an interview with the
newspaper. “Here there is going to be action.”  Vuyelwa Qinga, a spokeswoman for Shiceka, didn’t immediately
respond to a message left on her mobile phone by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
