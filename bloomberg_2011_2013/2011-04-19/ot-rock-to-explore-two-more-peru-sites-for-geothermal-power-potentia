(Corrects location in first paragraph of April 19 story.)  Hot Rock Ltd. (HRL) , an Australian
geothermal developer, won permission to explore two sites in the
south of Peru for potential to support  power plants  as the South
American country seeks to diversify its power supply.  The sites, called Chocopata and Quella Apacheta, together
cover 295 square kilometers (115 square miles), the Brisbane-
based company said in a statement today.  Peru gets 52 percent of its electricity from fossil fuels
and 48 percent from hydroelectric plants, according to the
statement. The country’s power grid will need to grow 6.2
percent a year to meet demand that may reach 10.5 gigawatts in
10 years, Hot Rock said, citing a report from grid operator
Comite de Operacion Economica del Sistema.  “The Peruvian government supports the development of
geothermal energy through legislation that provides a mechanism
for setting feed-in tariffs, tax incentives and guaranteed
connection to the grid and sale of all power produced,”
Executive Chairman Mark Elliott said in the statement.  With the awards, Hot Rock now owns the rights to explore
three sites in  Peru  and eight in Chile, according to the
statement. The company expects to get five more Peruvian
concessions in the next few months, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
