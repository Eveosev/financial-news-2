Zhejiang Glass Co., which has been
suspended from trading in  Hong Kong  for almost a year, denied a
report by news website Hexun.com that it may declare bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy is “impossible,” Tao Haipin, a Zhejiang Glass
investor relations official, said by telephone today. “We are
looking for partners for restructuring.” The company’s stock
was suspended May 2010 pending the release of its 2009 earnings.  Hexun reported yesterday that Zhejiang Glass may declare
bankruptcy or be acquired by a state-owned company, citing banks
and the local government of the region where the company is
based. The glassmaker owes banks 7 billion yuan ($ billion),
Hexun reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the
company’s accounts.  “Basically, the company is now under the control of the
local government and the future is all based on the government’s
decision,” Zhejiang Glass’s Tao said today by telephone.  Zhejiang Glass was the first company from  China  founded by
private individuals to list shares in Hong Kong, Hexun reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
