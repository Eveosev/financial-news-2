The World Food Program has moved
wheat, flour and other food aid into western  Libya  for the first
time since conflict erupted in the nation in February.  The Rome-based  United Nations  agency said eight trucks
crossed into Libya from  Tunisia  yesterday and that the Libyan
Red Crescent would deliver the supplies to the “crisis-affected
population, particularly women and children,” in Tripoli,
Zintan, Yefrin, Nalut, Mezda, Al Reiba and Al Zawia.  The trucks carried enough food to feed 50,000 people for 30
days, the WFP said today.  The opening of what the agency called a “humanitarian
corridor” into western Libya was made possible by the agreement
on April 17 between the UN and the regime of  Muammar Qaddafi  to
allow access to Tripoli and other areas under government
control.  “Securing this humanitarian corridor is a first vital step
in reaching thousands of hungry people affected by the conflict,
in particular women, children and elderly people, whose food
supplies are running alarmingly short,” WFP Executive Director
Josette Sheeran said in a statement.  Unicef, the UN Children’s Fund, said a ship carrying first
aid kits, drinking water and hygiene material for up to 25,000
people would arrive in Misrata tomorrow.  “Fifty days into the fighting in Misrata, the full picture
of the toll on children was emerging,” the UN said in a summary
of a briefing to reporters in Geneva. “It was far worse than
Unicef had feared and certain to get worse unless there was a
cease-fire.”  The  World Health Organization  said Misrata Hospital was
“overwhelmed” with patients needing emergency surgery and that
120 require immediate evacuation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
