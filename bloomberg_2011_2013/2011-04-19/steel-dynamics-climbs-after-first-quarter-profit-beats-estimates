Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) , a recycler of
steel scrap, climbed to the highest level in 10 months in Nasdaq
trading after reporting first-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates.  Net income rose 59 percent to 46 cents a share from 29
cents a year earlier, the  Fort Wayne , Indiana-based company said
in a statement after the close of regular trading yesterday.
That beat the 41-cent average of eight analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. Steel shipments climbed 4 percent to 1.5
million tons.  Steel Dynamics is “optimistic” about 2011 and expects
higher steel use in industries including energy and
transportation, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Keith Busse
said in the statement. Margins at the company’s steel division
increased to $132 a ton, said  Michelle Applebaum , managing
partner at Steel Market Intelligence, a Chicago-based industry
consultant.  “Steel Dynamics remains our top pick in the sector,”
Applebaum said in a note.  Net income climbed 63 percent to $105.9 million from $65
million and sales gained 30 percent to $2.02 billion.  The shares rose $1, or 5.7 percent, to $18.46 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the biggest intraday
gain since June 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
