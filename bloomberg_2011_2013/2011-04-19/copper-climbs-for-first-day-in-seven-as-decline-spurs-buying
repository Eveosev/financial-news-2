Copper in  London  climbed for the
first time in seven days as a drop to a one-month low attracted
buyers. Zinc and lead also advanced.  Three-month-delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
rose as much as 1.3 percent to $9,345 a metric ton and was at
$9,340 at 9:07 a.m. Singapore time. The contract dropped to
$9,207 a ton yesterday, the lowest since March 17.  “The drop close to $9,000 is considered quite attractive
to physical buyers in  China  these days so that’s been keeping
prices supported above $9,000,” Lin Jihan, a manager at Shanli
Futures Co., said from Wenzhou.  July-delivery copper on the Comex in  New York  gained as
much as 0.8 percent to $4.2525 a pound. The metal for June-
delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell as much as 1.8
percent to 69,800 yuan ($10,685) a ton.  “The  U.S. dollar  has also been driving direction
recently,” said Lin. “Even if the rest of the world tightens,
we’ll still face the problem of excess liquidity if the U.S.
doesn’t.”  The dollar was little changed against a basket of six
currencies after rising the most since January yesterday. The
currency gained even as Standard & Poor’s put a “negative”
outlook on the long-term AAA credit rating of the U.S., sending
the S&P 500 down by the most in a month.  China boosted banks’ reserve requirements this week for the
fourth time this year, two weeks after it hiked  interest rates 
to help contain inflation and limit the risk of asset bubbles.
Central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said April 16 that monetary
tightening will continue for “some time.”  European Tightening  The  European Central Bank  raised rates this month for the
first time since July 2008 as consumer prices accelerated. In
the past week, Governing Council members  Ewald Nowotny  and Luc
Coene signaled the ECB will keep tightening monetary policy this
year to curb inflation as the economy strengthens.  The  Federal Reserve  on the other hand has kept the
benchmark interest rate close to zero since 2008. Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke will hold his first press conference following the
Federal Open Market Committee statement on April 27 after a two-
day meeting in Washington.  Zinc in London advanced 0.3 percent to $2,331.25 a ton,
lead increased 1.3 percent to $2,560 a ton and tin climbed 0.8
percent to $32,600 a ton. Aluminum dropped 0.4 percent to
$2,664.75 a ton, and nickel fell 0.4 percent to $25,407 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
