Piotr Bujak, an economist at Bank
Zachodni WBK in Warsaw, comments on Polish industrial output and
producer price data, which were released today in Warsaw.  Industrial output rose an annual 7 percent in March, the
slowest rate since October 2009 and below the median estimate of
22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg for an increase of 9.6
percent.  Producer prices increased by 9.3 percent in March from the
year-earlier period, compared with a median estimate of 8.3
percent in a survey of 19 economists.  “This is a pretty significant slowdown and we’ll have to
expect further weakening in the output figures as the economies
of our main trading partners slow. German growth is likely to be
weaker, for example, which will hurt our exports.  “The disappointing output figures will be an argument for
Monetary Policy Council members who want to wait with the next
rate increase.  On the other hand, the  producer price index  was very
strong, which could raise fears this will transfer to retail
prices. The price pressures are an argument for the hawks in the
central bank.  “The May rate-setting meeting could be a very close call.
I don’t expect a rate increase next month, though. The central
bank won’t want to give the impression that it’s just reacting
to current data.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
