Cantor Fitzgerald LP, the bond
broker working to transform itself into a full-service
investment bank, sold $635 million of bonds backed by commercial
mortgages in its first sale of the securities.  The pool of loans includes a $52.4 million mortgage on the
Hudson Valley Mall in Kingston, New York, and $41.4 million in
debt on Tribeca West in  Los Angeles , according to a person
familiar with the transaction who declined to be identified
because terms aren’t public.  Cantor started its real-estate finance business in
September as issuance revived after freezing up in 2008. Banks
have arranged about $8.6 billion of commercial-mortgage backed
securities this year, compared with $11.5 billion for all of
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  is planning a $1.5 billion sale.  The largest AAA slice of New York-based Cantor’s deal, a
$304.7 million portion maturing in 4.77 years, yields 125 basis
points, or 1.25 percentage points, more than the benchmark swap
rate, the person said. A $153.6 million portion of top-rated
securities maturing in 9.64 years yields 140 basis points over
the benchmark.  Top-rated securities tied to commercial property loans are
yielding 1.93 percentage points more than Treasuries, compared
with 2.28 percentage points on Dec. 31, according to a Barclays
Plc index. Relative yields on the debt were as low as 1.88
percentage points on Feb. 18, the data show.  Issuance may climb to $45 billion this year, according to
JPMorgan. Sales plummeted to $3.4 billion in 2009 during the
financial crisis from a record $234 billion in 2007, Bloomberg
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
