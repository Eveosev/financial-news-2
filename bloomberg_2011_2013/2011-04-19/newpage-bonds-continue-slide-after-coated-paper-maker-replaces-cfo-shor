Bonds of NewPage Corp. continued to
decline after the coated-paper maker replaced its chief
financial officer last week.  Its $806 million of 10 percent notes due in May 2012 fell
three cents to 56.5 cents on the dollar as of 8:50 a.m. in  New
York , according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The debt has declined from 61 cents on the dollar on April
15, when the Miamisburg, Ohio-based company said that Curtis
Short, its controller and chief accounting officer, will become
CFO on an interim basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
