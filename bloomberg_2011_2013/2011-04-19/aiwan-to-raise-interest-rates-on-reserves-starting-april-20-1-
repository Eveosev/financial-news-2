Taiwan ’s central bank said it will
increase the interest rates it pays banks for money held in
reserve starting April 20 to reflect higher funding costs.  The interest the central bank pays on lenders’ reserves
that come from  demand deposits  will rise to 0.233 percent from
0.203 percent, while the rate for funds from  time deposits  will
climb to 1.043 percent from 0.986 percent,  the Central Bank of
the Republic of China (Taiwan)  said in an e-mailed statement.  The interest is paid on 55 percent of the lenders’ reserves,
the central bank said in today’s statement.  The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by
0.125 percentage point to 1.75 percent in March, adding to
increases of the same amount each in June, September and
December from a record low.  The monetary authority today reiterated that it won’t pay
lenders interest on reserves held for Taiwan-dollar deposits
from foreigners. The measure came into effect on Jan. 1.  The  central bank  on Dec. 30 increased the reserve
requirement on some local-currency deposits by foreigners to as
much as 90 percent, also effective Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
