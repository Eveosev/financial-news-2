Hungarian wages rose at a slower
annual pace in February than economists forecast.  The average monthly gross wage climbed 4.8 percent to
202,654 forint ($1,076), the biggest increase since March 2010,
the Budapest-based  statistics office  said in a statement today.
The median estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for
wage growth of 5.1 percent.  Public wages rose 4.6 percent after dropping 12.5 percent
in January while salaries at private companies increased 4.3
percent. Regular private wages excluding bonuses, one of the
 central bankâ€™s  most closely watched indicators for determining
inflation expectations, rose an annual 3 percent in February.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
