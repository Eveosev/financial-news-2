Zain  Saudi Arabia , a unit of
 Kuwait ’s Mobile Telecommunications Co., said its first-quarter
loss narrowed as the kingdom’s third-largest phone company by
market value attracted customers with new services.  The loss fell to 532 million riyals ($141.9 million), or
0.38 riyal per share, from 662 million riyals, or 0.47 riyal, a
year earlier, the Riyadh-based company said in a statement on
the Saudi  bourse website  today. First-quarter revenue rose 36
percent to 1.48 billion riyals.  Saudi telecom companies, including  Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) , are
competing for mobile-phone and Internet customers with
advertising campaigns and pricing promotions. Mobile-phone users
rose 15 percent to 51.6 million by the end of 2010 from a year
earlier and  Internet users  increased 11 percent to 11.4 million,
the Saudi Communication and Information Technology Commission
said on its Web site.  The quarterly loss narrowed “due to the success of the
company in expanding its customer base by offering new
services,” Chief Executive Officer Saad al-Barrak said in the
statement.  Zain Saudi Arabia’s share price declined 11 percent during
the first quarter. The share price closed unchanged at 6.95
riyals yesterday in  Riyadh .  $600 Million Refinancing  Zain Saudi Arabia said on April 12 it signed an accord with
a group of banks on refinancing $600 million of debt. The two-

to the Saudi bourse.  Zain Saudi’s net debt rose to 14.68 billion riyals by the
end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Zain signed an agreement with Bahrain Telecommunications
