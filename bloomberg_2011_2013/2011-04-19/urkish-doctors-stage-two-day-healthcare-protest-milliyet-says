Turkish doctors will work reduced
hours today and tomorrow to protest against the changes the
government is making in the country’s healthcare system,
Milliyet newspaper reported.  The Turkish Medical Association, the biggest group of
doctors, will cover  emergency services  and no more, reducing
their level of  service  to that of a public holiday, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said, citing association head Eris
Bilaloglu.  The government’s new health system deprives doctors of job
and wage security, sufficient training, and professional
independence, Bilaloglu said, according to the newspaper.
Doctors aren’t given enough protection against violence at work,
he said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
