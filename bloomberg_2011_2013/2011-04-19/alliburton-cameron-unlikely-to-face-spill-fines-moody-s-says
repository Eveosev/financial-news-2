Halliburton Co. (HAL)  and  Cameron
International Corp. (CAM) , which provided cement work and equipment
involved in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, are less likely to
face fines than other companies, Moody’s Investors Service said.  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , stake-owners in the
blown-out Macondo well, as well as  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , which owned
the drilling rig, may face “severe monetary penalties,” the
ratings agency said today in a report. The legal cases
surrounding the spill will last at least another year, it said.  The credit implications from the spill are still
“uncertain” a year after the explosion on the Deepwater
Horizon rig killed 11 workers and started the worst U.S. spill,
Moody’s said. BP, the operator of the well, has provisioned $41
billion for the spill and has yet to receive payment from its
partners for clean-up costs.  “Authorities have yet to determine and apportion blame or
impose legal and financial penalties,” said  Steven Wood ,
managing director for oil and gas at Moody’s. “Our analysis
suggests that the accident may result in financial penalties of
between $40 and $60 billion.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
