The German government may consider
paying utilities including  RWE AG (RWE)  and  E.ON AG (EOAN)  capacity payments
to boost construction of new  power plants  after events in Japan
closed nuclear plants, analysts said.  Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition plans to expand
offshore wind parks and build more gas plants to plug a
potential gap in power generation that will likely follow a
retreat from nuclear power. Merkel, who plans to accelerate
Germany’s exit from nuclear power, last month ordered the
operators of the country’s seven oldest atomic plants to idle
the reactors for a safety check after the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami crippled Japan’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station.  “We believe that targeted capacity payments to incentivize
the construction of flexible fossil fuel generation are a
possible outcome, similar to what the U.K. government is
proposing,” Barclays Capital analysts including Peter Bisztyga
and Monica Girardi said in a note to investors yesterday.  Seeking to meet climate change targets and replace aging
power stations, the British government is considering reforms
including capacity payments. The payments would reward low-
carbon generators, like nuclear reactors and offshore windfarms,
for providing low carbon power, regardless of the price of
electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
