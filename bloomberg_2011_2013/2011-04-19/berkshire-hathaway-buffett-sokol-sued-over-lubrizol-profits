Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  and Chief
Executive Officer  Warren Buffett  were sued by a shareholder over
trades in  Lubrizol Corp. (LZ)  by former Berkshire manager David Sokol.  Berkshire investor Mason Kirby, suing to recover damages
for the company, contends that Sokol, also a defendant, hurt the
firm by taking a stake in Lubrizol before recommending to
Buffett that Berkshire buy the company, according to papers made
public today in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington.  “Sokol knew that Buffett would closely consider and likely
take his recommendation,” Kirby said. “As a result of Sokol’s
unethical behavior, Berkshire suffered significant reputational
losses and other damages.”  Sokol bought 96,060 shares of Lubrizol in early January
before recommending that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire acquire
the company, Buffett said in a March statement announcing
Sokol’s resignation.  Buffett didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment
e-mailed to his assistant,  Carrie Kizer .  Ann Thelen, a spokeswoman for Berkshire’s MidAmerican
Energy Holdings Co., where Sokol remains  chairman  until April
21, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment from Sokol.  Kirby alleges that Buffett and Sokol, “working in
concert,” violated duties to shareholders “and put the company
at risk for a potential adverse SEC action and negative credit
rating.”  The case is Kirby v. Sokol, CA6392, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
