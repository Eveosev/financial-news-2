Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has called for an immediate ceasefire in  Libya  and said
the  United Nations ’  Security Council  is not pushing for regime
change in Libya or any other country in the region.  “The Security Council has never put a change of regime in
Libya or any other country as its goal,” Lavrov, on a one-day
official visit to Belgrade today, told reporters, adding that
those “who use the Security Council resolutions to change
regimes are violating the mandate of the United Nations.”  Lavrov said opposition parties in Libya, backed by some
western countries, were refusing to “sit at the negotiating
table” and that the international community should be
supporting “dialogue, not confrontation.”  Opposition parties in other countries, including Yemen,
“seem to think they can reject sitting at the negotiating table
because they expect assistance from abroad,” he said. “That is
a very dangerous logic which can cause chain reactions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
