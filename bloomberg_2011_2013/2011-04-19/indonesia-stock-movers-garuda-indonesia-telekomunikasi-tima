Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  rose 5.58 points, or 0.2
percent, to 3,732.65.  PT Garuda  Indonesia  (GIAA IJ), the nation’s largest
airline, rose 1.9 percent to 540 rupiah, the steepest gain since
April 1. Crude oil for May delivery fell 2.3 percent to $107.12
a barrel in  New York  yesterday, the first decline in four days,
and was at $105.98 a barrel in after-hours trading. A lower oil
price reduces the risk of higher fuel costs for the carrier.  PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TLKM IJ), Indonesia’s biggest
telephone company, jumped 4.1 percent to 7,650 rupiah, the
steepest increase since March 24. Telkom, as the company is also
known, said today it may spend as much as 3 trillion rupiah
($345 million) to buy back shares.  PT Timah (TINS IJ), Indonesia’s largest tin producer, fell
1.8 percent to 2,800 rupiah, the biggest drop among mining
companies. Tin futures retreated 2.3 percent to $32,350 a metric
ton in  London  yesterday, the sharpest drop since March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
