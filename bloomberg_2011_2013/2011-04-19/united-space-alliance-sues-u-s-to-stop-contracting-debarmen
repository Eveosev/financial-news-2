United Space Alliance LLC , a joint
venture equally owned by  Boeing Co. (BA)  and  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ,
sued the U.S. in a bid to prevent being barred from government
contracts over a dispute involving pay data.  United Space Alliance, the largest U.S. space shuttle
contractor, asked a federal court in Washington today to block
an April 11 Labor Department order requiring the company to turn
over detailed compensation data within 30 days or face
debarment.  “Debarment of United Space from receiving future
government contracts will subject United Space to irreparable
harm because its primary government contract is winding down
based on completion of the Space Shuttle program,” said the
company, which had $1.81 billion in government contracts last
year according to Bloomberg Government data.  The Houston-based company said the Labor Department order
stems from a probe into gender pay disparity.  Tracy Yates, a United Space spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.  United Space announced April 15 that after the final
mission of the U.S. Space Shuttle Program this year, the company
will cut its workforce by up to 50 percent. The company
currently employs 5,600 people in  Florida , Texas and Alabama.  The case is United Space Alliance v. Solis, 11-cv-00746,
U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
