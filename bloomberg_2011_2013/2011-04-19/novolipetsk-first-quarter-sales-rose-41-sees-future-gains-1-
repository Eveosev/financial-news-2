OAO Novolipetsk Steel, owned by
Russian billionaire  Vladimir Lisin , reported a 41 percent gain
in first-quarter sales to $2.4 billion, and forecast further
increases in revenue and output in the following three months.  The margin on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization was 20 percent to 25 percent in the first
quarter, it said in a statement, from 23 percent a year ago.  Crude steel production rose 1.8 percent in the quarter from
a year before and fell 2.8 percent from the prior three months.  “We expect sequential growth in second-quarter sales
volumes as market conditions improve,” the company said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
