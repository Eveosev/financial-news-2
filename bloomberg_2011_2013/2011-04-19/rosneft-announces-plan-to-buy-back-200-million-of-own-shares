OAO Rosneft will buy back as much
as $200 million of its shares in the “coming months,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Rosneft said its RN-Development unit bought $104 million of
shares on April 13.  The shares Rosneft is acquiring will probably be used for
its management compensation program,  Luis Saenz , the London-
based director of international sales at Otkritie Securities
Ltd., which has a "buy" recommendation on Rosneft stock, said in
an e-mail.  Rosneft increased its holding of own shares to 9.5 percent
from 9.4 percent on April 13, it said today in a regulatory
filing. That was a a day before it extended the deadline on a
stalled share swap with BP Plc to May 16. The Moscow-based oil
producer agreed in January to swap 9.5 percent of its stock for
5 percent of BP stock.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
