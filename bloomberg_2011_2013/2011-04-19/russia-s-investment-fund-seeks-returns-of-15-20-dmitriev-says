Vladimir Dmitriev, chairman of
Russia’s state development bank VEB, comments on the country’s
planned sovereign investment vehicle, the Direct Investments
Fund. Dmitriev spoke to reporters in  Washington , where he
participated in International Monetary Fund meetings on April 16
and April 17. Russia plans to complete registration of the fund
as soon as May, he said.  On returns:  “Co-investors will invest 5 rubles per ruble of
investments from the fund. The sectors that matter for investors
are those that are understandable, where they are able to secure
good returns on their investment. We expect that won’t be below
15 percent. Overall, we’re talking about 20 percent. That’s what
is attractive to the investors with whom we are in talks.”  On the size of the fund:  “This year, we’re talking about $2 billion. We plan that
the Russian share of the fund will be formed at $10 billion over
five years.  “We have to show a pipeline of projects and only then ask
for money. It makes no sense to ask for $2 billion if we only
have projects for $1 billion. We presume that this $1 billion
will generate $5 billion in private investments.”  On sectors of the economy that the fund will invest into:  “Agriculture, food-processing industry, pharmaceutical
industry, anything that has a good potential for growth in
