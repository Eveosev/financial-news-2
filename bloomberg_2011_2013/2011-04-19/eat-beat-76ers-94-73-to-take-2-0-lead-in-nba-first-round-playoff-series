The  Chicago Bulls  used a late rally
to beat the Indiana Pacers 96-90, while the Miami Heat never
trailed in routing the Philadelphia 76ers 94-73 in their
National Basketball Association playoff series.  The Bulls and Heat, the top two seeds in the Eastern
Conference, hold 2-0 leads in their best-of-seven first-round
series.  “We just wanted to protect home court,”  LeBron James , who
led the Heat with 29 points last night, said in a televised
interview. “We did what we’re supposed to.”  The New York Knicks visit the Boston Celtics in Game 2 of
their Eastern Conference series tonight after losing the opener
87-85 on Ray Allen’s 3-pointer with 11 seconds left.  The Knicks may be without point guard  Chauncey Billups 
because of a knee injury suffered during Game 1 in Boston.  “I’m disappointed. This is the worst time, getting hurt in
the first round of the first game of a tough series,” Billups
told reporters after sitting out yesterday’s practice. “I know
the team really needs me.”  The Orlando Magic host the Atlanta Hawks in Game 2 tonight
after losing Game 1 at home 103-93 three days ago.  The  Portland Trail Blazers  visit the  Dallas Mavericks  in
today’s final game. The Mavericks won the opener of the Western
Conference series.  Rose Lifts Bulls  Derrick Rose  scored 14 of his game-high 36 points in the
fourth quarter last night at the United Center in  Chicago  as the
Bulls pulled away from the Pacers, who were the only team to
make the playoffs with a losing record.  “We knew it was going to be tough,” Rose said in a
televised interview. “We’re just happy that we won.”  Carlos Boozer  added 17 points and 16 rebounds for Chicago,
which had the NBA’s best record during the regular season.  The Bulls, who have won 11 straight games, made their final
15 free throws and outscored the Pacers 29-23 in the fourth
quarter. They took the lead for good on a 3-point play by Rose
with 5:43 remaining. Danny Granger scored 19 points to lead
Indiana.  The best-of-seven series moves to Indianapolis for Game 3
on April 21.  “We’re standing toe to toe with this team. I’m very proud
of our guys,” Pacers coach Frank Vogel said during a news
conference. “We’ll take it back to Indy and see what happens.”  At AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami, the Heat rolled to the
first win of more than 10 points this postseason.  Chris Bosh 
added 21 points and 11 rebounds for Miami, while  Dwyane Wade 
played through migraine headaches to score 14 points.  Heat Roll to Win  The Heat, the second favorite to win the NBA title after
the  Los Angeles Lakers , outscored the 76ers 30-18 during the
second quarter to open a 49-31 halftime lead. Miami stretched
its advantage to 28 points during the fourth quarter and limited
the seventh-seeded 76ers to 34 percent shooting.  “If they’re playing on top of their game, they’re a better
team,” 76ers coach Doug Collins said. “That doesn’t mean we’re
not going to play, compete and fight. It’s going to be very
difficult to beat them.”  Miami has won nine straight games against Philadelphia
dating back to the 2009-10 season.  The teams shift to Philadelphia for the next two games,
with Game 3 scheduled for April 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
