Malaysia’s ringgit fell to a four-
week low as sovereign debt concerns in the U.S. and  Europe 
prompted investors to favor safer bets than emerging-market
assets.  The currency dropped the most in a week after  Standard &
Poor’s  cut the outlook on its AAA rating for the U.S. to
negative from stable and the yield on  Greece ’s two-year bonds
exceeded 20 percent. Asian stocks fell for a third day and gold
climbed for a third day to record on safe-haven demand.
 Government bonds  declined.  “People will sell and remain on the sidelines for a while
given the uncertainty and knee-jerk aversion to risk,” said Lam Chee Mun, a  fund manager  in Kuala Lumpur at TA Investment
Management Bhd. “It’s a timely reminder that countries will
need to consider how they will pay up when the bills come due.”  The ringgit weakened 0.1 percent to 3.0260 per dollar as of
4:08 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched 3.0365, the weakest level since
March 22.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks dropped 1.1 percent,
tracking declines in U.S. and European equities. S&P put a one-
in-three chance of a U.S. credit-rating downgrade within two
years, saying policy makers need to agree on a plan by 2013 to
reduce budget deficits and the national debt. The cost of
insuring Greek government debt rose to a record yesterday.  The additional yield on developing nations’ debt over U.S.
Treasuries increased eight basis points to 273 yesterday, the
highest level since March 18, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s EMBI+ Sovereign Spread. It fell 6 basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, as of 9:08 a.m. in  London .  Inflation Survey  Five-year notes declined, snapping a six-day rally and
lifting yields from a one-month low, before a government report
on inflation tomorrow.  The yield on the 4.262 percent note due September 2016
increased 3 basis points to 3.57 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia. The price dropped 0.12, or 1.2 ringgit per 1,000
ringgit face amount, to 103.38.  Consumer prices probably rose 3.1 percent in March from a
year earlier, matching the biggest increase since April 2009,
