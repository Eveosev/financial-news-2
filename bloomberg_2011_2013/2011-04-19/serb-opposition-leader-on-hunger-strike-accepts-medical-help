Tomislav Nikolic, the  Serbian
Progressive Party  leader who has been on hunger strike for three
days to appeal for early elections, accepted medical help today.  “I am not suicidal and I have not decided to step out of
the Serbian Orthodox Church. Treat my strike as a fast,”
Nikolic told reporters from his hospital bed, adding that the
church has not understood “correctly” the motives for his
strike.  The Serbian Patriarch said yesterday that food-and-water
strikes were non-Christian and called on Nikolic to end it.  Nikolic, who wants elections to be held on Dec. 18, is the
former deputy leader of nationalist Serbian Radical Party, whose
leader Vojislav Seselj is standing trial at the United Nations
war crimes tribunal in The Hague.  Serbia  is trying to become an European Union candidate by
the end of the year and get a date for the start of membership
talks. The ruling  Democratic Party  of President  Boris Tadic 
wants elections once this goal has been achieved. Elections in
Serbia are due in March 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
