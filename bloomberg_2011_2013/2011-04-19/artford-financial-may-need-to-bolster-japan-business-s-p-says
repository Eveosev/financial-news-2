Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer that repaid a $3.4 billion bailout, may have
to bolster its Japan unit as last month’s earthquake cuts the
value of securities tied to client guarantees.  “The company may need to increase the capital it holds to
support its Japanese annuity business, but we believe it
maintains appropriate capital redundancy to withstand this,”
 Standard & Poor’s  said today in a statement on Hartford, based
in the Connecticut city of the same name. S&P raised its outlook
on Hartford’s BBB credit rating to “stable” from “negative”
last month.  Hartford’s obligations in Japan stem from guarantees made
to clients that bought variable annuities, the equity-based
retirement products. In 2009, the company halted new sales in
Japan while retaining liabilities tied to annuities sold before
the financial crisis. When Japanese stocks fall, those
liabilities may increase.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Index has dropped 9.5 percent since March
10, the day before the earthquake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
