Ghana ’s central bank will sell its
second three-year bond of 2011 as it seeks to raise funds to pay
off maturing debt, said Collins Antwi, assistant director at the
 Bank of Ghana ’s treasury department.  The Accra-based bank will offer 320 million cedis ($212
million) in an auction April 27, according to a statement
published on its website.  “As much as 200 million cedis worth of existing bonds will
mature in the early week of May,” Antwi said by phone today.
“The excess will be used for government payments.”  Sales of the cedi-denominated bond, the shortest duration
of domestic-currency issues open to investors outside the
world’s second-biggest cocoa producer, will settle on May 2, the
central bank said on its website.  The last sale of the same duration, on Feb. 16, sold 401.2
million cedis at a 13.45 percent yield and was oversubscribed by
88 percent, the Bank of  Ghana  said.  The cedi strengthened for the first day in three, trading
at 1.5090 per dollar at 4:36 p.m. local time, from a close
yesterday of 1.5150, as foreign investors brought dollars into
the country to convert to cedis before the bond sale, according
to Chris Nettey, a currency trader at Stanbic Bank Ghana Ltd.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
