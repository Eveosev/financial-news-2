Savola (SAVOLA)  Azizia United Co., a Saudi
Arabian food producer, said first-quarter profit declined 58
percent after a 2010 capital gain wasn’t repeated and global
commodity prices hurt margins.  Net income dropped to 165.2 million riyals ($44 million),
or 0.33 riyal a share, from 394 million riyals, or 0.79 riyal a
share, a year earlier, the company said in a statement to the
 Saudi bourse today . That fell short of the mean estimate of
186.3 million riyals by three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Jeddah-based Savola has expanded its retail business to
meet rising demand in the Arab world’s biggest economy. Savola
has 113 outlets in the kingdom and it also refines sugar in
 Egypt , the Arab world’s most populous nation.  First-quarter profit retreated because of capital gains of
196 million riyals from the initial public offering of  Herfy
Food Services Co. (HERFY)  during the first quarter of 2010, the company
said in its statement, citing Managing Director Abdul Raouf Mannaa. First-quarter revenue increased 17 percent to 5.6
billion riyals from a year earlier, it said.  Savola shares lost 2.2 percent, the biggest drop since
March 15, to 26.7 riyals at 12:29 p.m. in Riyadh.  Commodity Prices  Higher global commodity prices have “impacted negatively
on the margins,” Savola said in the statement.  First-quarter operating profit fell 13 percent to 288.3
million riyals, the company said in the statement. This drop was
“mainly due to the increase in selling, marketing and
administrative expenses for the retail stores opened by the
group during last 12 months,” the company said.  The company will pay a dividend of 0.25 riyal a share, or
125 million riyals, for the first quarter. Savola forecasts net
income before capital gain of 225 million riyals for the second
quarter of 2011, according to the company statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
