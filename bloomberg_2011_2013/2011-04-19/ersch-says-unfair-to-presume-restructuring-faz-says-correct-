(Corrects comment in fourth paragraph to say  Spain  has
lower public debt than others instead of deficit.)  European Central Bank Governing
Council member Yves Mersch said presuming countries like Greece
will not honor their debt obligations is an “unfair”
assumption, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported, citing an
interview.  Countries receiving aid “have parliamentary resolutions to
stick to the program,” Mersch was cited as saying when asked
about Greek debt restructuring speculation. “To deny these
democracies the will to honor their obligation is an unfair and
blanket assumption.”  Asked if the Greek troubles would derail the ECB’s timeline
for interest-rate increases, Mersch said the central bank has a
“mandate to secure  price stability  over the medium term and
there are no ifs and buts about it,” according to the
newspaper.  Mersch also said that Spain is “different” to  Greece ,
Portugal and Ireland and has lower public debt, FAZ said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
