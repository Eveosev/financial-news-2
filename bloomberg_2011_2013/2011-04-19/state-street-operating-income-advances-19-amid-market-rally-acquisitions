State Street Corp. (STT) , the third-
largest custody bank, said first-quarter net income on an
operating basis climbed 19 percent, as rising markets and
acquisitions increased the assets it oversees for clients.  Profit rose to $439 million, or 88 cents a share, from $369
million, or 75 cents, a year earlier, the Boston-based company
said today in statement. Operating profit beat the 86-cent
average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The main driver is the rebound in the markets,”  Marty Mosby , a Nashville, Tennessee-based analyst for Guggenheim
Securities LLC, said in an interview before results were
announced. “Markets activity is rising to more normal levels
and valuations are moving higher.”  The average value of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the
three months ended March 31 rose 16 percent from the first
quarter of 2010. Revenue increased 2.8 percent to $2.36 billion.  State Street raised its quarterly dividend to 18 cents a
share on March 18 and said it would buy back as much as $675
million in common stock this year, a step toward restoring the
way it used free  cash flow  before the financial crisis. The
company slashed its dividend from 24 cents a share to 1 cent on
Feb. 5, 2009, in an effort to preserve capital as client assets
shrank and its own investments plunged in value.  Stock Performance  Results were announced before the start of regular U.S.
trading. State Street has declined 3.6 percent this year. The
Standard & Poor’s 17-member index of asset managers and custody
banks was little changed.  Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
both based in New York, are the two biggest custody banks.  Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend
securities for institutional investors including mutual funds,
pension funds and  hedge funds . State Street also manages
investments for individuals and institutions.  (State Street is scheduled to hold a conference call for
investors at 9:00 a.m. New York time. The call can be accessed
