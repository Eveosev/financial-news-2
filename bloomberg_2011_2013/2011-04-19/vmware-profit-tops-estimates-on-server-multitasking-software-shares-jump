VMware Inc. (VMW) , the biggest maker of
programs that let computers run multiple operating systems,
reported first-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates as
it benefited from a foray into storage and desktop software.  Profit excluding certain costs was 48 cents a share,
exceeding the 42-cent average of projections compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 33 percent to $843.7 million, the  Palo
Alto , California-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts on average estimated $814.5 million. The company’s
shares surged as much as 12 percent in extended trading.  Clients are using VMware software to turn more of their
servers -- computers used to run websites and networks -- into
multitasking machines that can operate several different
applications, said Brian Freed, an analyst at Wunderlich
Securities Inc. The company has been adding staff and spending
more on research and development as it ramps up new businesses
including security and storage.  “They released 18 new products last year, and here we are
almost six months later,” Robert Breza, an analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets  in  Minneapolis , said in an interview. “You’re
starting to see the new products penetrate the customer base.”  VMware, majority-owned by EMC Corp., climbed as high as $96
in late trading after the earnings report. The shares fell 53
cents to $85.97 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock has declined 3.3 percent this year.  Sales Forecasts  Sales in the second quarter will be $860 million to $880
million, the company said. That’s greater than the $846.6
million average estimate of analysts. VMware expects full-year
2011 revenue to be $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion.  First-quarter net income rose 60 percent to $125.8 million,
or 29 cents a share, from $78.4 million, or 19 cents, a year
earlier.  VMware has added almost 400 employees since the beginning
of the year and will keep hiring at a “brisk pace” throughout
2011, Chief Financial Officer Mark Peek said on a conference
call. The company will continue to invest to take advantage of
“a lot of very strong long-term growth opportunities,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
