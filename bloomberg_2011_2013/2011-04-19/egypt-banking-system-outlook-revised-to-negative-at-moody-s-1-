Moody’s Investors Service revised
the outlook for the Egyptian banking service in the next 12 to
18 months to “negative” from “stable.”  The change reflects the “elevated political uncertainty”
in  Egypt  following an uprising that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in February and the weakened macroeconomic outlook,
Nondas Nicolaides and Yves Lemay, wrote in a statement today.  “Even though Egypt’s ruling military regime has committed
to holding democratic elections in order to meet people’s
demands, Moody’s believes that there are still elevated risks
involved in an orderly transition toward democratic rule,”
Limassol, Cyprus-based Nicolaides was cited as saying.  Moody’s expects the country’s economy to slow, growing
around 2 percent in the next 12 to 18 months due to a decline in
tourism, and direct foreign investment.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
