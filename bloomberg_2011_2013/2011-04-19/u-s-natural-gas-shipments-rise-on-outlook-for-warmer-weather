Scheduled natural gas shipments to
U.S.  power plants  rose to the highest level in almost 10 weeks
on forecasts for warmer weather that may boost air conditioning
demand. Shipments to the Southeast increased for a second day.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to power generators in the
U.S. and Canada rose 4.2 percent to 14.4 million dekatherms
(14.1 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg as of 11:30 a.m. in New York. That level was the
highest since Feb. 10.  Power plants in the Southeast were to receive 2.87 million
dekatherms of gas, 5.7 percent more than yesterday, Bloomberg
data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences declined 4.7
percent to 26.8 million dekatherms.  Forecasters including  Commodity Weather Group LLC  in
Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted that temperatures in the South
would be as much as 14 degrees above normal through April 28.  Wholesale gas delivered at the Sonat-T1 hub, where gas is
transported to the Southeast from Texas and Louisiana, rose 7.43
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $4.2406 per million British thermal
units yesterday on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
advanced 2.25 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $4.233 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
