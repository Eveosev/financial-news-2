Commercial International Bank Egypt
SAE (COMI)  advanced the most this month, leading gains among Egyptian
lenders after the country’s central bank eased requirements for
booking provisions on non-performing loans.  Commercial International, the nation’s biggest publicly
traded lender, rose 2.2 percent to 28.63 Egyptian pounds at the
2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. National Societe Generale Bank, the
country’s second-largest, gained 3.4 percent, the most in three
weeks, to 37.24 pounds. The EGX 30 Index climbed 2.5 percent.  Banks can extend the period to classify a retail loan as
non-performing to three months from the time payment was due,
the central bank said yesterday. Previously, lenders were
required to move the loans to the non-performing portfolio after
30 days. That gives banks more time before having to book
provisions against defaulted loans.  "The previous strict rules would have required the banks to
raise provisions especially for retail clients who had a drop in
business recently," said Monette Doss, banking analyst at Cairo-
based  Prime Holding (PRMH)  who had forecast an increase in Commercial
International provisions to 80 million pounds ($13 million) this
year from 6 million pounds in 2010. “This will help their
bottom lines.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
