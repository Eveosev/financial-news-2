TNK-BP,  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Russian oil
venture, sees the collapse of the U.K. company’s Arctic
exploration deal with state-run OAO Rosneft as the “least
interesting outcome,” said Alexander Shokhin, an independent
director on TNK-BP’s board.  TNK-BP, equally owned by BP and a Russian group of
billionaires, wants an opportunity to expand into the Arctic
offshore, Shokhin said today in an interview in Moscow. TNK-BP
has little chance of developing such a project on its own
because it lacks the technology, he said.  The billionaire partners have held up BP’s plan to swap 5
percent of its stock for about 9.5 percent in Rosneft and to
explore for resources in the Kara Sea, claiming TNK-BP has
exclusive rights to pursue opportunities in  Russia  for BP.  BP asked arbitrators to allow it to carry out the share
swap on its own, and Rosneft extended the deadline by a month to
May 16.  TNK-BP wants to either join the alliance or seek as much as
$10 billion in compensation from BP, Shokhin said. No resolution
to the dispute has been found yet, he said.  AAR rejected a $27 billion buyout offer from BP last week,
a person with knowledge of the proposal said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
