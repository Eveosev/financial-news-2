Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, named Brazil’s Deputy Finance Minister Nelson Barbosa as a member of its board after announcing earlier this
month the replacement of its chief executive officer.  Barbosa, 41, will be one of four new members joining  Vale ’s
board, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a regulatory
filing after a shareholders meeting today. Seven other board
members had their mandates renewed until 2013, Vale said.  The announcement comes two weeks after Murilo Ferreira was
nominated to replace Chief Executive Officer  Roger Agnelli 
following two years of government calls for the company to
invest more in domestic steel output and fertilizers. Ferreira,
who was president of Vale’s Canadian operations until 2008, will
take over May 22 after Angelli’s mandate expires, Vale said
April 4.  Barbosa, an economist trained at the New School for Social
Research in  New York , occupied several positions at Brazil’s
Finance Ministry since 2006 until being named deputy finance
minister by President  Dilma Rousseff . Barbosa is also chairman
of state-controlled Banco do Brasil, Latin America’s biggest
bank by assets, and a director at insurance company
Brasilveiculos Cia de Seguros SA, according to an earlier
regulatory filing by Vale.  Vale gained 53 centavos, or 1.2 percent, to 45.73 reais in
Sao Paulo trading today. Before today, Vale shares lost 6.8
since since the start of the year, more than the 5.6 percent
decline for the benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
