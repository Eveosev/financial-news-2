Wheat rose for a third day in
Chicago as worsening winter-crop conditions in the U.S., the
largest exporter, and delayed spring-crop plantings fueled
supply concerns amid strengthening demand.  About 38 percent of the winter-wheat crop was in poor or
very poor condition as of April 17, up from 36 percent a week
earlier and 6 percent a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday. Dry weather in the past week from
central  Kansas  to  Texas  hurt crops. About 5 percent of the
spring-wheat crop was  sown , against 18 percent a year earlier
and the prior five-year average of 12 percent, the USDA said.  “Wheat prices rose sharply on the news of the slow spring-
wheat planting and on the further news that the condition of the
current winter-wheat crop is really quite bad,” economist
 Dennis Gartman  said in his daily Gartman Letter.  Wheat for July delivery gained 12.75 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $8.235 a bushel by 10:54 a.m. London time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Prices reached a one-week high of $8.2475 after
jumping 3.9 percent yesterday. Milling wheat for May delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris climbed 6.25 euros, or 2.5
percent, to 252.25 euros ($360.01) a metric ton.  Wheat output in Texas, the fifth-largest U.S. grower, may
plunge 61 percent to 50 million bushels as the dry spell damages
plants and farmers abandon fields, said Mark Welch, a grain-
marketing economist at  Texas A&M University . About 68 percent of
the Texas winter-wheat crop was in poor to very poor condition,
the USDA said yesterday.  Lowest Since 2006  Yields in the U.S. may drop to 38 or 39 bushels an acre,
the lowest since 2006, without improved weather conditions, said
Dennis Delaughter, owner of Progressive Farm Marketing Inc. in
Edna, Texas. The national yield has been below 40 bushels only
twice in the past 13 years, USDA data show.  Wheat inspected for export at U.S. ports rose 24 percent
from a week earlier to 35.7 million bushels in the week to April
14, the USDA said yesterday.  Corn for July delivery rose for a second day in  Chicago ,
advancing 1.75 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $7.6125 a bushel.
Sowing of the grain in the U.S., the largest grower and
exporter, fell behind last year’s pace.  About 7 percent of the corn crop was planted as of April
17, down from 16 percent a year  earlier , the USDA said
yesterday. At least a third of the crop should be sown by May 1
or yield potential may be diminished, said Greg Grow, director
of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  Soybeans for July delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.2 percent,
to $13.5325 a bushel after two advances in a row. China’s
soybean crushers canceled more than 10 cargoes of the oilseed
this month to cut growing losses for processing, state-
affiliated researcher Grain.gov.cn said in a report today.  Crushers have also delayed shipments of more than 20
cargoes, it said. The cancellations and delays will likely lower
 China ’s imports in the year through Sept. 30 to about 53 million
tons, compared with 57 million tons estimated by the USDA, the
researcher said. The Asian country is the world’s biggest
soybean importer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
