Two people were killed and 43
injured in violence that erupted among high-school students from
two tribes in southern  Tunisia , the Interior Ministry said.  About 2,000 people, most of them students armed with
hunting rifles, stones and other weapons, were involved in the
unrest that took place in the southern town of Snad, resulting
in the deaths of a young man and woman, the ministry said in a
faxed statement today, without giving a reason for the fighting.  Authorities imposed a curfew on Snad from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m.
