EDF Energies Nouvelles SA (EEN) , a French
renewable energy developer, has agreed to buy two wind projects
totaling 324 megawatts in the south of Mexico as it seeks to
expand into the Americas.  The first project, Eoliatec del Istmo, will have a capacity
of 164 megawatts, and the second, Eoliatec del Pacifico, will
have a capacity of 160 megawatts, the Paris-based company said
in a statement distributed by Business Wire today. The purchase
price wasn’t disclosed.  EDF Energies Nouvelles generated 34 percent of its revenue
from power plants in the Americas and 66 percent from  Europe  in
2010, according to information compiled by Bloomberg.  “This operation strengthens EDF EN Group’s position in
 North America  and accelerates its development in  Mexico , a
country with abundant wind resources and promising future for
solar,” according to the statement.  The company already operates a 67.5-megawatt wind farm in
Oaxaca, the same state where the projects will be built, EDF
Energies Nouvelles said.  Bought from Madrid, Spain-based wind and solar developer
 Eolia Renovables de Inversiones  through EDF’s Mexican unit, the
projects are expected to start generating power by 2013,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
