Ethanol futures declined in  Chicago 
as corn and gasoline fell on concern that higher prices will
reduce demand.  The biofuel slid 0.4 percent on speculation that gasoline
pump prices, which averaged $3.835 a gallon yesterday according
to AAA, will crimp demand and that corn prices, which have
gained 19 percent this year, will curtail export. Ethanol is
made from corn in the U.S. and blended with gasoline.  “Gasoline and corn were both lower and ethanol just
followed along,” said Matt Janney, a broker at Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. in Chicago. “People are trying to talk waning
demand right now.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery slipped 1 cent to $2.621
a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have risen 10
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.735 a gallon, and in  New York  the additive rose 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.70, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast dropped 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.71 a gallon and in Chicago the alternative fuel
increased 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.615.  Corn futures for July delivery decreased 2.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to close at $7.57 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel
distills into at least 2.75 gallons of the fuel.  Gasoline for May delivery fell 1.97 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to settle at $3.2331 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, or RBOB,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are breaking even on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
