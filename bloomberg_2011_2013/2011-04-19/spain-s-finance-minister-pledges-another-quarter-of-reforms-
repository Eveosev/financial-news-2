Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado pledged to push ahead with “another quarter of
reforms” as the government seeks to win the confidence of
investors.  “We have improved a lot in terms of the perception of the
markets in recent months during which we have carried out big
reforms,” Salgado said in an  interview  with Cadena Ser radio
station today in  Madrid . “This quarter will also be a quarter
for reforms.”  The euro had its steepest decline in almost four months
yesterday and Greek and Portuguese bonds tumbled on speculation
 Greece  may default, sending risk premiums for Spanish debt
soaring. The “fundamentals” of the Spanish economy are
unchanged from last week and the government will press ahead
with cutting the deficit and forcing struggling lenders to
bolster capital, said Salgado.  The spread between Spanish and German 10-year borrowing
costs narrowed to 228.5 basis points from 230.6 basis points
yesterday. The spread soared from 175 basis points a week ago
after comments by German officials speculating that Greece may
run out of alternatives to restructuring and the outcome of a
Finnish election underscored the risk that political opposition
to the European Union’s rescue of  Portugal  may grow.  “We are on the path toward correcting these imbalances and
we have to keep on doing reforms, reducing our public deficit
and restructuring our financial system,” Salgado told Ser. “In
the end, it’s the fundamentals of the economy that the markets
judge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
