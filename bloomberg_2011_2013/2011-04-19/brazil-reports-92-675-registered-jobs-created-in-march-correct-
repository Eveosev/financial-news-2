(Corrects revised jobs number in February in second
paragraph.)  Brazil â€™s economy created 92,675
government-registered jobs in March, the Labor Ministry said.  The figures compare with a revised 315,315 registered jobs
created in February, the ministry said in a report distributed
today in Brasilia.  Government-registered  job creation  is a balance of posts
created minus job eliminated. Registered jobs, so-called formal
work, assure employees a range of benefits such as unemployment
insurance, bonuses and retirement payments by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
