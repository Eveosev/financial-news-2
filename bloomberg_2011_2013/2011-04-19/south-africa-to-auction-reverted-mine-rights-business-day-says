South Africa ’s Department of
Mineral Resources will set up a bidding system allowing
investors to compete for mineral rights that have reverted to
the state before June, Business Day reported, citing Director-
General Sandile Nogxina.   The department will ensure that no outstanding litigation
affects the properties and that previous owners don’t have legal
claims to them before putting them on auction, the Johannesburg-
based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
