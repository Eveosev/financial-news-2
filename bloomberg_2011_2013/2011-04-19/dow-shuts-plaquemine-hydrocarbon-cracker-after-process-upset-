Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemical maker, shut the light hydrocarbon cracker 3 after a
“process upset” at its Plaquemine plant in Louisiana, said
Gregory Baldwin, a company spokesman.  The cracker was safely shut down and there were no
injuries, Baldwin, who is based at company headquarters in
Midland,  Michigan , said today in an e-mail. It was taken offline
after a process upset April 16. A restart date is being
assessed, according to Baldwin.  A cracker split oil products like naphtha and liquefied
petroleum gases through pressure and heat. Outages can increase
prices for ethylene and propylene as companies turn to spot
markets to help them meet supply contracts.  The company shut an ethylene plant at Plaquemine for over
two weeks on Feb. 16 to make repairs, Baldwin said at the time.  Plaquemine is 94 miles (151 kilometers) northwest of  New
Orleans .  To contact the reporter on this story:
