Serbia’s new, precautionary credit
with the  International Monetary Fund  may be negotiated within
the coming months and start in September,  Danas  reported, citing
Mission Chief Albert Jaeger.  The new loan program, size is yet to be determined, will
help Serbia reduce the number of public workers, make the
pension system more sustainable and the economy more export-
oriented, Jaeger was quoted as saying by the newspaper. Funds
from the credit would be drawn only in case of “external
shocks” such as soaring energy prices, according to the report.  Serbia’s initial 3 billion-euro ($4.26 billion) bailout
loan with the IMF expired last week. The country drew only about
a half of the amount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
