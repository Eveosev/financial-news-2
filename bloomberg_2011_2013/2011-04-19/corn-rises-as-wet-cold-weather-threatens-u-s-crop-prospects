Corn futures rose for the second
straight day on speculation that cold, wet Midwest weather will
delay planting, threatening prospects for crops in the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer.  Fields will get frequent storms in the next two weeks with
occasional flooding expanding across the southern growing
region, where crops need to be planted early to avoid summer
heat,  World Weather Inc . said today in a report. About 7 percent
of the crop was planted as of April 17, down from 16 percent a
year ago, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.  “The forecasts will continue to make farmers nervous and
support corn,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. West  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “The market will
continue to focus on the weather until planters start to roll
actively” across the Midwest, he said.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 0.5 cent to $7.60 a
bushel at 10:39 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Yesterday,
the price climbed 1.3 percent. The most-active contract has
doubled in the past year after adverse weather reduced the size
of last year’s U.S. crop and demand for livestock feed and
grain-based fuel rose.  U.S. corn inventories before this year’s harvest are
forecast at 675 million bushels, down from 1.708 billion a year
ago and the lowest since 1996, the USDA said on April 8.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
