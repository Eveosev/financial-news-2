Serbia  will ask the United Nations
Security Council to start an international probe into
allegations of organ trafficking in Kosovo in the 1990s, Foreign
Minister Vuk Jeremic said.  The Balkan nation is seeking the investigation after a
December report by Dick Marty, a Swiss member of the 47-member
 Council of Europe  and its lead investigator, that implicated
Kosovo Premier Hashim Thaci in organ trafficking and drug
smuggling, Jeremic told reporters in Belgrade today.  Kosovo, a nation of 2 million, mostly ethnic-Albanians,
declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, a move
Serbia has vowed never to accept. Most Western powers have
recognized Kosovo as a state, including 22 out of 27 members of
the European Union and the U.S.  The  Kosovo  government, led by Thaci who was a guerrilla
leader of Kosovo’s separatist ethnic Albanians in the 1990s, has
dismissed Marty’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
