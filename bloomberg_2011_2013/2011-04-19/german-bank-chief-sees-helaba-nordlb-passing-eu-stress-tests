Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen and
Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale will probably pass a new
round of European stress tests this year after their owners find
a way to meet  capital requirements  that are tougher than under
German rules, the head of Germany’s state-owned bank association
said.  “My hope is that Helaba and NordLB will pass the test,”
Christian Brand, head of the Association of German Public Sector
Banks, said at a press club event in Frankfurt late yesterday.
“The owners have an interest in finding a solution.”  The two state-owned German lenders risk falling below the
threshold of a 5 percent core Tier 1 capital ratio set by the
European Banking Authority if funds received from savings banks
and state governments aren’t recognized. The non-voting capital,
which is permitted by German bank supervisors, will only be
counted if it was provided as aid during the financial crisis,
according to measures laid out by the EBA this month.  Helaba and NordLB have said they are looking at how to
convert the so-called silent participations into core capital
that will meet the criteria. They are among banks rushing to
strengthen the quality of their capital after the EBA on April 8
said it will apply a tougher measure to 90 lenders across
 Europe . Today is the deadline for German lenders to submit data
to the financial regulator Bafin and Deutsche Bundesbank.  Last year’s tests, which allowed national regulators to use
their own capital definitions, weren’t deemed strict enough by
bank analysts. Lenders in the 27-nation region were shown to
need 3.5 billion euros ($5 billion) of additional capital, about
a 10th of the lowest analyst estimate.  ‘Certain Affront’  Brand criticized the EBA’s decision not to count the silent
participations of German state-owned lenders, also known as
Landesbanken. While capital provided to Helaba and NordLB won’t
be counted, aid to the country’s second-largest commercial
lender,  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , provided by Germany’s Soffin bank-rescue
fund will be recognized under the EBA’s criteria.  “Treating banks with different legal forms differentially
is discriminatory,” said Brand.  Under German rules, silent participations are recognized as
core capital until 2018.  “I don’t think it’s fair to change the parameters,” said
Brand. “I would have to understand this as a certain affront
against  Germany  and German banks.”  Brand also said German banks could absorb a possible
restructuring of Greek debt.  “It wouldn’t be the end of the world,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
