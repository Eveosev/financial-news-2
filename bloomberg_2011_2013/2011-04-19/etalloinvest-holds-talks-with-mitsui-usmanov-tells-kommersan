Metalloinvest,  Russia ’s largest
iron-ore producer, is continuing talks with  Japan ’s Mitsui & Co.
about a possible partnership after a deal stalled, billionaire
shareholder Alisher Usmanov said today in an interview published
today in Kommersant.  Mitsui demanded “excessive” guarantees in talks last year
about buying 15 percent of Metalloinvest’s Lebedinsky iron-ore
processing plant in the Belgorod region, Usmanov said in the
interview, which was confirmed by spokeswoman Yulia Mazanova.  To contact the reporter on this story:
