Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan
says the government will make unpopular budget cuts to deliver a
surplus as natural disasters crimped  tax revenue  and a strong
currency put “immense” pressure on parts of the economy.  Revenue this fiscal year will fall more than A$4.5 billion
($4.7 billion) because of two months of flooding and a tropical
cyclone in the northeastern state of Queensland, Swan will say
today in Brisbane, according to excerpts of prepared remarks
given to reporters.  The Australian dollar’s 13 percent gain in the past year is
hurting tourism, education and manufacturing, according to the
e-mailed notes of the speech. Voters oppose rushing to bring the
budget into surplus, with 61 percent in a Nielsen  opinion survey 
published in the Age newspaper April 18 saying the government
could delay its efforts.  “We will withstand the impacts of natural disasters just
like we withstood the global financial crisis and our economic
fundamentals remain very strong,” Swan will say. “We take no
joy in announcing cuts to this budget.”  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  has pledged to achieve a
surplus in the year ending June 30, 2013. Swan in November
forecast a A$41.5 billion deficit in the current fiscal year,
followed by A$12.3 billion shortfall the following year. The
budget, due to be presented to parliament on May 10, will
deliver a A$3.1 billion surplus in 2012-13, those forecasts said.  Mining companies will increase investment and attract more
workers, stretching the economy’s capacity in coming years, Swan
will say.  To contact the reporter on this story:
