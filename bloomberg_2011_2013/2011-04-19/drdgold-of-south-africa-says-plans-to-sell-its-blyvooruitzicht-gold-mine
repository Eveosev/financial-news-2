DRDGold Ltd. (DRD) , a producer of the
metal in  South Africa , said it plans to sell its Blyvooruitzicht
mine near Johannesburg after a review of operations.  “Blyvoor no longer fits the core strategic focus of the
company,” Johannesburg-based DRDGold said in a statement today.
“It has therefore resolved to sell the mine and has appointed
Royal Bank of Canada as well as Beijing Axis to advise on the
transaction.”  Blyvooruitzicht accounted for about half of DRD’s total
production in the quarter ended March 31, yielding 30,511 ounces
of the total output of 67,387 ounces, DRD said today.  DRD snapped three days of gains, falling 6 cents, or 1.6
percent, to 3.60 rand in Johannesburg yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
