Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , the
world’s largest brewer, had its long-term debt ratings raised
one step to A- at Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, which
cited the company’s cash generation and debt reduction.  AB InBev’s corporate credit and senior unsecured debt
ratings were increased to A-, the fourth-lowest investment
grade, from BBB+ and the outlook on the rating is stable, S&P
said today in a statement. Moody’s Investors Service rates the
senior unsecured debt of Leuven, Belgium-based AB InBev at Baa1,
the third-lowest investment grade.  The brewer of  Bud Light  and Stella Artois cut net debt by
$5.47 billion to $39.7 billion last year, or about three times
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
based on S&P metrics. The brewer last year also refinanced
the final portion of the $54.8 billion in bank loans it obtained
in 2008 to fund its purchase of Anheuser-Busch Cos. for $52.5
billion in cash.  “The stable outlook reflects our view that ABI will
continue to use its strong earnings to moderate its debt
leverage over the short to medium term,” Anna Overton, a credit
analyst at S&P in  London , said in the statement. “Further
rating upside is conditional, in our view, on the group’s
willingness to maintain a ratio of fully adjusted debt to Ebitda
of close to two times.”  AB InBev’s 750 million euros ($1.07 billion) of 4 percent
notes due in April 2018 fell 0.29 cent to 100.41 cents on the
euro as of 1:46 p.m. in Brussels. The bonds traded as high as
106.92 cents on the euro on Aug. 30, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
