Peru’s sol held at a four-month low
as concern former military rebel Ollanta Humala may win a
presidential runoff led foreign investors to sell the local
currency.  The sol was little changed at 2.8233 per  U.S. dollar  at
4:12 p.m. New York time, from 2.8225 yesterday. That’s its
weakest level on a closing basis since Dec. 13. The sol has
dropped 2 percent in the last month, the second-biggest decline
after the Japanese yen among world currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  “Foreigners have been buying dollars in the  spot market  as
they cut back on their Peru holdings,” said Gonzalo Navarro,
head trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima. “Humala is the reason
behind the uncertainty. The market doesn’t believe his moderate
stance.”  Humala, who has pledged to renegotiate contracts with
foreign companies and the country’s trading partners if he is
elected, finished first in the April 10 vote, winning 32 percent
of the ballots. The second round of elections will be held on
June 5.  Peru ’s central bank sold 50 million soles ($17.7 million)
worth of six-month certificates of deposit today. The bank last
week sold dollars for the first time since 2009 to ease the
currency’s slide. Banco Central de Reserva del Peru didn’t buy
or sell dollars in the  currency market  today, it said on its
 website .  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 was little changed at 7.25 percent,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. It has increased 95
basis points, or 0.95 percentage point, from 6.30 percent a
month ago. The bond’s price today remained at 104.08 centimos
per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
