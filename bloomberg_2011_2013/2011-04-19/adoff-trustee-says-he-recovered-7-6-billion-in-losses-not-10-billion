The trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff’s defunct investment firm said he has recovered more than
$7.6 billion for investors in the  Ponzi scheme  against fees of
$175.5 million requested since Madoff’s arrest.  Irving Picard , who has filed more than 1,000 suits seeking
money for the con man’s investors, said in February he was
halfway to recovering the $20 billion in principal lost when
Madoff was arrested in 2008. In a court filing April 18, he put
the recovery $2.4 billion lower, at about 44 percent of
principal lost. Most of the difference is the amount of
forfeited funds held by the U.S. Attorney, which has been
disputed in court.  Picard gave the new numbers as part of a fee request to a
bankruptcy judge, seeking approval for $43.2 million for four
months’ work by himself and his law firm, Baker & Hostetler LLP.
Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard, declined to comment.  Picard’s biggest recovery was a $7.2 billion settlement he
and U.S. prosecutors reached in December with the estate of
Jeffry Picower, a Madoff investor who died in 2009. Of that
amount, about $5 billion went to Picard, and $2.2 billion to the
U.S., he said in the filing in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
 Manhattan .  Picard said in March he had recovered $2.6 billion for
Madoff customers, with $5 billion to be added from his share of
the Picower settlement as well as the money forfeited to the
government, pending the outcome of court challenges to both
agreements.  Unpaid Money  “We anticipate that our position will ultimately
prevail,” Picard said.  Counting all those amounts, he said he
had recovered “approximately one-half of the monies that we
estimate were stolen in the Madoff fraud and remain unpaid.”  Recoveries could rise if Picard’s suits against feeder
funds succeed, the trustee said in March.  A settlement with Boston philanthropist  Carl Shapiro 
brought in $550 million, and a deal with  Switzerland ’s Union
Bancaire Privee fetched $470 million.  Picard’s law firm said it spent 7,086 hours on
investigations at a cost of $3.1 million from Oct. 1 to Jan. 31.
Administration consumed 7,033 hours, and cost $2.1 million. The
trustee’s case against  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  took 1,971 hours,
while a case against the owners of the  New York Mets  required
1,660 hours and customer claims took 4,837 hours, according to
the filing.  In all, the Madoff case took almost 955 hours of Picard’s
time during the period, charged at $748 an hour, and 116,399
hours of his firm’s time at $371 an hour, according to the
filing.  The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
