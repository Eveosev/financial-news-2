Kazakhstan will consolidate state
stakes in BTA Bank, Temirbank and Alliance Bank, three of the
four Kazakh lenders that defaulted in 2009, in a new management
company, central bank Chairman Grigori Marchenko said.  Yelena Bakhmutova, former chief of the disbanded Agency for
Financial Supervision, will head the new company, which will be
under management of the National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna,
Marchenko told reporters in Almaty today.  The state-owned Samruk-Kazyna bought a stake in BTA in
early 2009 and the government later took over Temirbank and
Alliance after credit markets froze and the countryâ€™s property
bubble burst.  BTA, Temirbank and Alliance Bank have reached restructuring
deals with creditors, allowing them to write off about $11
billion of debt. The government owns 81.48 percent of ordinary
shares in BTA, 67 percent in Alliance and 79.9 percent in
Temirbank, according to the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange  website .  Kuat Kozhakhmetov, former deputy chief of the Agency for
Financial Supervision, was appointed acting head of a new
financial supervision committee in the central bank, Marchenko
said. The regulator was disbanded, with its functions
transferred to the central bank, according to Marchenko.  To contact the reporter on this story:
