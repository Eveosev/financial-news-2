Stocks rebounded from the biggest
drop in a month after companies from  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  to
 Burberry Group Plc. (BRBY)  reported results that beat analyst
estimates. Gold futures touched $1,500 an ounce for the first
time as the dollar weakened. Treasuries rose.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6 percent to
1,312.62 at 4 p.m. in New York as higher-than-forecast housing
starts also drove gains. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased
0.5 percent as Burberry rallied 6 percent. The euro climbed 0.7
percent to $1.4332. Canada’s dollar strengthened versus 14 of 16
major peers as accelerating inflation triggered bets the central
bank will boost  interest rates .  Johnson & Johnson, the world’s second-biggest seller of
health-care products, led gains in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  after increasing its full-year forecast. Burberry,
Britain’s biggest luxury retailer, said quarterly sales jumped
32 percent and  SKF AB (SKFB) , the world’s largest maker of ball
bearings, posted record profit. Stocks slid yesterday as S&P cut
the long-term U.S. credit outlook to negative.  “This market has been very resilient,” said Burt White,
who helps oversee $284 billion as chief investment officer at
LPL Financial Corp. in Boston. “Things are better than people
think as far as the economy goes. Today’s housing numbers were
pretty good. You’ve got a bellwether such as Johnson & Johnson
coming out with good news. The market is excited to see that.”  Earnings Season  The  S&P 500  rebounded after yesterday dropping 1.1 percent,
the most since March 16. J&J climbed 3.7 percent after new drugs
and a weaker dollar boosted results. Steel Dynamics Inc. added
5.7 percent as its profit also beat projections. Newmont Mining
Corp. helped pace gains in raw-material producers, rising 1.3
percent as gold and copper prices increased.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  rallied as much as 1.5 percent
after earnings topped estimates, before erasing gains and
retreating 1.3 percent after Rochdale Securities LLC reduced its
rating to “neutral” from “buy.”  About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges,
15 percent less than the three-month average as trading slowed
on the Passover holiday.  A gauge of homebuilders in S&P indexes gained 2.2 percent
as all 12 of its stocks advanced. A report today showed building
permits, a proxy for future construction, rose 11 percent to a
594,000 pace. They were projected to rise 1.1 percent to a
540,000 annual pace. Housing starts increased 7.2 percent to
549,000, exceeding the 520,000 median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  About three shares gained for each that fell in the Stoxx
600. SKF rallied 6.4 percent.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
SA (MC) , the world’s largest luxury-goods maker, advanced 4.7 percent
as sales beat analysts’ estimates.  Novartis AG (NOVN) , the third-
biggest stock in the index, gained 3.5 percent after the
drugmaker’s sales and profit surpassed projections.  AAA Rating  The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped two
basis points to 3.36 percent and the 30-year yield lost three
basis points to 4.43 percent.  President  Barack Obama  began a tour promoting his proposal
to cut long-term budget deficits with a new urgency after S&P
said yesterday that the nation’s AAA credit rating is in peril.
The divide between Republicans and Democrats in Congress over
combating the nation’s debt was spotlighted by S&P’s lowering of
the long-term U.S. credit outlook to “negative,” with each
side saying the alert bolsters their competing arguments.  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said he’s confident
U.S. political leaders will bridge their differences and move
toward a long-term plan to narrow record budget deficits and
reduce the debt.  ‘Strong Targets’  “We have an opportunity now over the next two months to
make some real progress,” Geithner said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television today. “What we agree on is putting in
place strong targets for savings, deficit reduction over a
specific time frame with enforceable limits,” he said.  Gold for June delivery settled up 0.1 percent at $1.495.10
after earlier reaching $1,500.50.  The dollar weakened against 12 of 16 major peers, losing at
least 1 percent versus Norway’s krone and Sweden’s krona. The
euro appreciated against 11 of its 16 major counterparts amid
speculation the  European Central Bank  will raise interest rates
further.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is nicknamed,
strengthened 0.8 percent to $1.0455 after the  consumer price
index  advanced 3.3 percent in March from a year earlier,
compared with a 2.2 percent pace of increase in the previous
month, Statistics  Canada  reported. The median forecast of 25
economists was for a 2.8 percent annual rate.  Commodities Gain  Crude oil for May delivery increased for the fourth time in
five days, rallying 1 percent to $108.15 a barrel as the weaker
dollar lifted commodities.  Oil traders have turned $80 crude into the second-biggest
bet in the options market as a surge in futures to the highest
level since 2008 spurred concern that demand may tumble.  Open interest, the number of contracts held by traders, has
more than doubled since January for $80 put options for December
2011 and 2012 as New York futures last week touched a 30-month
high of $113.46 a barrel. The two puts, bets that prices will
fall, account for 21 percent of the open interest among the top
10 contracts traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.  Commodities, Emerging Markets  The S&P GSCI index of 24 commodities gained 0.3 percent,
recouping some of yesterday’s 1.2 percent slide. Cotton
retreated 3.9 percent. Wheat futures rose 1.3 percent, a third
straight gain, as weather conditions in the U.S. worsened and
 Germany ’s crop estimate was lowered amid a dry spell.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index increased 0.6 percent as
benchmark gauges in  Russia , Turkey,  South Africa , Egypt and
Hungary rallied more than 1 percent. The Shanghai Composite
Index led declines in  Asia , sliding 1.9 percent, on concern the
U.S. debt outlook may deteriorate further and speculation that
 China  will further tighten monetary policy.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1 percent to the lowest
level this month as S&P’s downgrade of the U.S. credit outlook
fueled concern that a recovery in the global economy may slow.  Greece’s two-year yields jumped as much as 39 basis points
to a record 20.73 percent as the government sold 1.625 billion
euros ($2.33 billion) of bills.  To contact the reporters on this story:
