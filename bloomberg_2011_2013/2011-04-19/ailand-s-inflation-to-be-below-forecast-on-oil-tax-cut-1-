Thailand ’s inflation rate this year
will be lower than initially forecast because of the
government’s plan to reduce taxes on fuel, central bank Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul said.  Inflation will be 0.7 percentage point lower than the
current forecast of 3 percent to 5 percent, and  core inflation 
will be 0.3 percentage point lower than the existing forecast of
2 percent to 3 percent, Prasarn said in Bangkok.  Prime Minister  Abhisit Vejjajiva  said yesterday the
government planned to cut taxes on diesel to help cap the retail
price at less than 30 baht per liter and ease the burden on the
state oil fund, which is used to subsidize fuel. The measure,
which the government expects will last until September, will
cost about 45 billion baht ($1.5 billion).  “The tax cut can suppress inflation only in the short term
as it can’t stay forever,” Deputy Governor Atchana Waiquamdee
said at the same event today. “Once the program ends, inflation
will spike up. This will distort  oil prices  and also distort the
behavior of oil users. The government should use this money to
develop infrastructure projects.”  Oil prices will remain high this year, before easing next
year, Prasarn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
