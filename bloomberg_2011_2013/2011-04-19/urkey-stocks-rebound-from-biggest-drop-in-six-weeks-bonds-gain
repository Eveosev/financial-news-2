Turkey’s main stock index rebounded
from the biggest drop in six weeks and bonds strengthened as
global investor sentiment improved on better-than-expected
earnings in Europe and the U.S.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  climbed the most since April 4,
gaining 134.49, or 1.7 percent, to 67,742.07 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Istanbul. The measure slumped 2.7 percent yesterday.
A rally in bonds pushed yields on two-year benchmark debt down
11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 8.58 percent, the
lowest level in more than a month, the RBS Istanbul benchmark
bond index showed.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index, a broad gauge of western
European equities, and  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index in  New York 
advanced after earnings from companies including LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, Johnson & Johnson and Burberry Group
Plc beat analysts’ estimates. Global markets tumbled yesterday
after Standard & Poor’s revised its long-term sovereign credit
outlook for the U.S. to negative from stable.  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM) , Turkey’s largest phone company by
sales, climbed 0.8 percent to 8.04 liras after the company said
first-quarter profit increased to 608.8 million liras, beating
the average estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The
stock has a 3.3 percent weighting in the ISE 100.  To contact the reporter on this story:
