WikiLeaks , condemned by the U.S.
government for posting secret data leaked by insiders, may have
used music- and photo-sharing networks to obtain and publish
classified documents, according to a computer security firm.  Tiversa Inc. , a company based in Cranberry Township,  Pennsylvania , has evidence that WikiLeaks, which has said it
doesn’t know who provides it with information, may seek out
secret data itself, using so-called “peer-to-peer” networks,
Chief Executive Officer Robert Boback claimed. He said the
government is examining evidence that Tiversa has turned over.  The company, which has done investigative searches on
behalf of U.S. agencies including the FBI, said it discovered
that computers in Sweden were trolling through hard drives
accessed from popular peer-to-peer networks such as LimeWire and
Kazaa. The same information obtained in those searches later
appeared on WikiLeaks, Boback said. WikiLeaks bases its most
important servers in  Sweden .  “WikiLeaks is doing searches themselves on file-sharing
networks,” Boback said in an interview, summing up his firm’s
deductions from the search evidence it gathered. “It would be
highly unlikely that someone else from Sweden is issuing those
same types of searches resulting in that same type of
information.”  ‘Completely False’  Tiversa’s claim is “completely false in every regard,”
said Mark Stephens, WikiLeaks’ London attorney, in an e-mail.
Stephens regularly represents media organizations, including
Bloomberg News.  Tiversa declined to say who its client was when it noticed
the Swedish downloads. Howard Schmidt, a former Tiversa adviser,
is cybersecurity coordinator and special assistant to U.S.
President  Barack Obama .  Tiversa researchers said the data-mining operation in
Sweden is both systematic and highly successful.  In a 60-minute period on Feb. 7, 2009, using so-called
Internet protocol addresses that every computer, server or
similar equipment has, Tiversa’s monitors detected four Swedish
computers engaged in searching and downloading information on
peer-to-peer networks. The four computers issued 413 searches,
crafted to find Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and other
information-rich documents among some of the 18 million users
the company estimates are on such file-sharing networks at any
given moment.  Those searches led to a computer in  Hawaii  that held a
survey of the Pentagon’s Pacific Missile Range Facility in that
state. Tiversa captured the download of the PDF file by one of
the Swedish computers. The document was renamed and posted on
the WikiLeaks website two months later, on April 29, 2009,
according to a  mirror image  of the site.  Navy Systems  A product of the U.S. Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare
Systems Center, the document exposed sensitive details of
infrastructure changes for outfitting the base with a new sensor
system. The mirror site said only that the file “was first
publicly revealed by WikiLeaks working with our source.”  Boback said the retrieval and posting follows a pattern his
researchers have tracked over and over. They estimate that as
much as half of the postings by the group could originate from
information siphoned from peer-to-peer users, he said.  “There are not that many whistleblowers in the world to
get you millions of documents,” Boback said. “However, if you
are getting them yourselves, that information is out there and
available.”  Tiversa provided its findings to U.S. agencies to aid what
Boback called the early stages of an investigation into the
matter. A separate criminal probe is being conducted by a U.S.
grand jury in  Virginia  regarding tens of thousands of diplomatic
cables and other secret material allegedly provided by U.S. Army
private Bradley Manning, Stephens said in December.  Swedish Allegations  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is in the U.K. fighting
extradition to Sweden, where he faces allegations of sexual
molestation and rape. Lawyers for Assange have said the
accusations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the
actions of WikiLeaks.  The U.S.  Justice Department  declined to comment on whether
there was an official investigation regarding the downloads
Tiversa concluded were done by WikiLeaks, said Dean Boyd, a
spokesman.  Lime Group, which owns the rights to LimeWire software,
shut its operations in December and an e-mail to Tiffany
Guarnaccia, a spokeswoman, couldn’t be delivered. The network
can be used by anyone who previously downloaded the software,
peer-to-peer experts said. Sharman Networks, which owns Kazaa,
referred inquiries to ICON Communications in Sydney,  Australia ,
which didn’t return e-mails seeking comment.  U.S. Probes  The U.S. investigations could provide authorities an
alternate path for prosecuting WikiLeaks and Assange, said Paul
Ohm, an expert in cyber crime at the University of  Colorado  in
Boulder.  Boback, whose firm has made such searches for the  Federal
Bureau of Investigation  and the  Internal Revenue Service  to
trace unauthorized downloads, argued that such conduct is just
information scavenging, not illegal hacking.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Warma in  Seattle , who
successfully prosecuted similar cases of unintended searching,
said the systematic pillaging of computer contents through peer-
to-peer networks could be pursued under federal anti-hacking
statutes.  Even if not criminal, such conduct, if traced to WikiLeaks,
would contradict its stated mission as a facilitator of leaked
material by insiders, whose identities, Assange has said, the
group takes measures not to know. The group provides an
encrypted drop box on its website that it said prevents any
tracing back to the source of documents.  Receptacle for Leaks  “If their information gathering doesn’t consist simply of
being a receptacle for leaks but of this more aggressive effort
to go out and cull this information, then you’re moving a clear
step further from anything that resembles traditional
journalistic practice,” said Mark Jurkowitz, the associate
director for the Washington-based Project for Excellence in
Journalism.  The evidence could also be used by congressional
committees, which Boback said are pursuing a separate inquiry to
undermine WikiLeaks’ claim that it’s a legitimate media
organization with protections under the First Amendment.  “There is a difference between being given information
that may have been obtained in violation of some agreement or
law versus the media itself violating the law or an agreement in
order to obtain information,” said Sandra Baron, the executive
director of the Media Law Resource Center in  New York . “The
media is not allowed to steal.”  Thousands of Documents  The WikiLeaks site has posted hundreds of thousands of
documents in the past four years. With the exception of
classified material allegedly provided by Manning, the source of
its leaked documents has never been publicly identified.  On Jan. 17, a former Swiss banker, Rudolf Elmer, turned
over information to Assange on almost 2,000 account holders
Elmer claims are guilty of  tax evasion  and other crimes. The
data has yet to be published by WikiLeaks.  Assange based the group’s primary servers in Sweden because
of the strength of that country’s media laws, which prohibit
authorities from inquiring about journalistic sources, he has
said. The group said in 2010 that the  Swedish Pirate Party ,
which aims to reform copyright law and ensure citizens’ right to
privacy, would host some of the group’s servers as well.  Assange has told interviewers he aims to make leaks
untraceable to avoid retaliation against providers by
governments or others harmed by the information.  Sourcing Information  “We cannot comply with requests for information on sources
because we simply do not have the information to begin with,”
WikiLeaks has said on its website.  The vulnerability of vast amounts of confidential and
secret information on peer-to-peer networks is a risk well-known
to researchers and security experts, as well as to information
scavengers and foreign intelligence agencies, according to  Eric
Johnson , an expert on peer-to-peer technology at Dartmouth
College’s Tuck School of Business in Hanover,  New Hampshire .  The networks are popular with U.S. soldiers in Iraq and  Afghanistan , who use them to download music and videos, as do
teenagers who sometimes download material on their parents’
computers, Johnson said. A Congressional subcommittee held
hearings in 2007 and 2009 on inadvertent sharing on such sites.  In 2009, Tiversa found the entire blueprints and avionics
package for Marine One, the presidential helicopter, on a
computer linked to  Iran , according to Boback’s 2009 testimony at
the hearings. His firm also found a leak of a file of a LimeWire
user that showed the safe-house location of the president’s
family.  Terrorism Targets  In late 2009, WikiLeaks published a spreadsheet detailing
vulnerable, potential terrorist targets in Fresno County
compiled by State of California security officials and the U.S.
Department of  Homeland Security . It noted locations for caches
of bomb-grade fertilizers; the location of large gasoline and
propane reserves; and the coordinates of key military and law
enforcement sites and their functions.  Asked to aid in the investigation of the leak by U.S.
authorities that the company declined to identify, Tiversa found
the spreadsheet was inadvertently exposed by a California state
employee using a peer-to-peer network in August 2008, more than
a year before WikiLeaks posted it.  A WikiLeaks post of Army intelligence documents in 2009
included reports on Taliban leaders and their movements, as well
as confidential notes of meetings where complaints were voiced
about the performance of Iraqi police. Those documents were
exposed to unauthorized searching on peer-to-peer networks more
than eight months earlier in September 2008, Tiversa
investigators found after they were asked to investigate the
matter by a client the company declined to identify.  Order of Battle  The Pentagon’s 58-page Afghanistan Order of Battle was
exposed in a file-sharing network in January 2009 and posted on
WikiLeaks four months later. For a downloaded list of every
Chevron Corp. property in the U.S. and  Canada , the posting gap
was two months -- from March to May 2009, the firm found.  Confidential documents can be mined from peer-to-peer
networks using malicious software that sucks out information
unrelated to the song, photo or other material users want to
share. In most cases, Johnson said all that is needed is weak
security settings or user mistakes that allow searchers to dig
into the computers of users who don’t realize that confidential
files on their hard drives can be tapped.  Congressional Legislation  The U.S. House of Representatives last year approved a bill
that would prohibit peer-to-peer file sharing software on any
U.S. government computer.  If federal prosecutors can definitely link the theft of
confidential information directly to WikiLeaks and its core of
paid staffers and volunteers, they would still face significant
challenges. The legal tools available to them for a criminal
prosecution aren’t firmly tested, according to lawyers and peer-
to-peer experts.  “It’s not a slam dunk either way” said Ohm, a former
Justice Department prosecutor.  In 2008, a  federal court  in  Oklahoma  found that removing
pornographic pictures from a computer by an FBI agent using
LimeWire didn’t constitute an illegal search. In contrast, Warma
successfully prosecuted two Seattle cases recently involving
individuals who retrieved financial information through LimeWire
“in excess of authorization.” Warma said retrieving
confidential information through peer-to-peer networks could be
prosecuted under the federal  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .  “I can almost guarantee you there is a task force at the
Department of Justice that’s been tasked with creatively coming
up with theories to use against WikiLeaks,” Ohm said. “I’m
sure that in those conversations the Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act has come across the board, especially with this new twist of
peer-to-peer networks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
