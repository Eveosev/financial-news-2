The ruble strengthened for the first
time in four days as crude, Russia’s biggest revenue-earner,
rose.  The ruble advanced 0.5 percent to 31.35 per dollar and less
than 0.1 percent to 40.63 per euro by the 7 p.m. close in
Moscow. The currency was 0.3 percent up at 35.526 versus the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket.  Oil gained 0.5 percent to $86 a barrel in New York, while
Urals, Russia’s main export blend, added 0.8 percent to $108.59,
reversing yesterday’s losses. Crude and natural gas account for
about 50 percent of Russia’s state revenue. The U.S. securities
industry canceled equity trading for a second day as  Hurricane
Sandy  swept across New York City.  “On this thin market the basket may follow solely oil
dynamics,” Nordea Bank AB’s analysts Dmitry Savchenko and
Aurelija Augulyte said in an e-mailed note today.  The ruble weakened 7.5 percent since this year’s peak of
28.9925 versus the dollar on March 26 when oil traded just $2.74
from the high of $109.77 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Russia’s currency lost 1.8 percent last week, the biggest
weekly decline since June.  Bank Rossii is due to review interest rates in the first
ten days of November. The central bank is likely to leave the
refinancing rate on hold at 8.25 percent, according to a median
estimate of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.8165 per
dollar in three months.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries was unchanged at 188, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index of five-year
government bond yields declined seven basis points to 7.07
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
