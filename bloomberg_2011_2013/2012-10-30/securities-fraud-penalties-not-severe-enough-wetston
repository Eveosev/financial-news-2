Penalties for  securities fraud  have
not been severe enough to deter repeat offenders, said the
chairman of Ontario’s securities regulator.  “Repeat offenders are unwilling to accept responsibility
for their actions, it tells me our penalties may not have been
an effective deterrent,” Howard Wetston said today at the
Ontario Securities Commission’s annual conference in Toronto.
“We need to continue to reevaluate our approach to more
aggressively seek jail terms and to strengthen our
settlements.”  The regulator secured 10 jail sentences in its last fiscal
year, resulting in a total of 16 years in jail for rule
breakers, according to the OSC’s annual  report .  Financial markets have become more complex and that
increases the need for the regulator to ensure investors are
informed when financial products are “comprehensive but not
always comprehensible,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
