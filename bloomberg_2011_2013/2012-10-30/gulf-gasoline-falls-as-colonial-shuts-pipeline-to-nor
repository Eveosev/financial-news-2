Gasoline weakened in the U.S. Gulf
Coast on speculation the area will see a boost in  fuel supply 
after Colonial Pipeline Co. shut a line that carries products to
the U.S. Northeast.  Colonial yesterday shut the 825,000-barrel-a-day Line 03,
which runs from Greensboro,  North Carolina , to Linden Junction,
 New Jersey . The pipeline operator asked in a bulletin to
shippers that deliveries on cycles 58 though 60 to Linden be
diverted to Line 04 to Maryland or to southern markets.  “There is a lot of supply that’s going to be backing up
because that’s not open,” Carl Larry, president of Oil &
Outlooks, LLC, said by phone from Houston today. “Until it’s
open it’s just sitting there but can’t go anywhere so we’ll feel
it in the market.”  Reformulated gasoline  on the Gulf Coast dropped 4 cents to
20.5 cents a barrel under futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 3:42 p.m.  Prompt delivery  fell 6.4 cents to $2.4121.  U.S. stockpiles of the motor fuel will probably decline by
500,000 barrels in the week ended Oct. 25, according to the
median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
