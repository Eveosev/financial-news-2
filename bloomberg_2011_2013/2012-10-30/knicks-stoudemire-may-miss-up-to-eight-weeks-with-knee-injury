Amar’e Stoudemire will probably miss
the first six to eight weeks of the National Basketball
Association season as he recovers from a left knee injury.  The 29-year-old  New York Knicks  forward will have surgery
to remove debris, damaged cartilage and bone from around the
joint, the team said in an e-mailed release yesterday. No date
was provided for the procedure.  Stoudemire hurt his knee during an Oct. 19 preseason game
against the Toronto Raptors and originally was expected to miss
two to three weeks, according to ESPN. The 6-foot-11 forward had
microfracture surgery on the same knee in 2005.  The Knicks will open their season tomorrow on the road
against the Brooklyn Nets in the new $1 billion Barclays
Center’s first NBA regular-season game.  The timing of the game was in doubt because of the effects
of  Hurricane Sandy , which shut down  New York  City’s public
transportation system.  A six-time All-Star, Stoudemire has averaged 22.4 points
and 8.0 rebounds per game in his two years with the Knicks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
