Serbian police said they filed
charges against 12 people, including two unidentified  England 
soccer players, after a brawl following an under-21 match on Oct
16, the  Associated Press  reported.  Police in Krusevac, where the match took place, said those
charged “committed an act of violence during a sports event,”
the AP added. Five unidentified Serbia players, and assistant
coaches from both teams, were also charged. Some spectators are
accused of lighting flares.  The day after the game, England’s Football Association
complained to European soccer’s governing body UEFA that its
team was subjected to racial abuse and stone-throwing from
Serbia fans. UEFA then said it started disciplinary proceedings
against the F.A. and the Serbian soccer federation for the
“improper conduct” of their players, and against the Serbian
body over alleged racist chanting by spectators.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
