A day after getting swept from the
 World Series , the  Detroit Tigers  were installed as betting
favorites to win  Major League Baseball ’s championship in 2013.  The Tigers, who eliminated the  New York  Yankees in four
straight games in the  American League  Championship Series to
reach the World Series, have 7-1 odds of winning next year’s
title, RJ Bell, president of handicapping information website
Pregame.com, said yesterday in an e-mail.  The Yankees, who led the American League with 95 victories
during the 2012 regular season, are second at 8-1. The  San
Francisco Giants , who won their second World Series title in
three years, are 10-1 to make it back-to-back championships.  The  Los Angeles Angels  are at 12-1 and the  Texas Rangers 
and Washington Nationals, who had the best record in baseball
this season at 98-64, have odds of 13-1 to win the 2013 World
Series. The Rangers must decide whether to re-sign free agent
 Josh Hamilton , who led Texas with 43 home runs and 128 runs
batted in last season.
