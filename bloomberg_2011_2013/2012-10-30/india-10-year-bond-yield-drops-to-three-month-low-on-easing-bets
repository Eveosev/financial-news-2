India ’s 10-year bonds declined the
most in three months as the central bank kept the repurchase
rate unchanged for a fourth policy meeting today.  Fourteen of the 33 economists in a Bloomberg survey had
predicted the Reserve Bank of India will cut the  repurchase  rate
from 8 percent, while the rest expected it to be unchanged. The
central bank cut the cash reserve  ratio  to the lowest level in
36 years to boost funds in the banking system and counter an
economic slowdown. Some investors believe the reserve
requirement cut may delay debt purchases by the central bank,
according to N.S. Venkatesh, head of treasury at  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)   “The lack of a rate cut has disappointed some investors,
who had taken long positions before the review,” said Mumbai-
based Venkatesh. “Demand may also fall if the RBI puts off
buying debt.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022
rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.18
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao last cut the repurchase rate
by 50 basis points in  April (APR)  after raising the rate by a record
375 basis points, or 3.75 percentage points, from March 2010
through October 2011 to tame inflation that has averaged 8.6
percent in the past three years.  The cash reserve ratio was reduced by 25 basis points today
to 4.25 percent. Twenty three of 33 economists in the Bloomberg
survey had predicted the cut.  Venkatesh forecast the central bank will purchase as much
as 700 billion rupees ($13 billion) of notes in the remainder of
the fiscal year ending March.  Quarterly expansion in Asia’s third-largest  economy 
averaged 5.4 percent in the first half of 2012, compared with
7.5 percent in the whole of 2011.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose 14 basis
points to 7.72 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
