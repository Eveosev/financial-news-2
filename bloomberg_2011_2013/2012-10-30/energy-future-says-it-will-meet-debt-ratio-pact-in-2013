Energy Future Holdings Corp., the
biggest power-generation owner in  Texas , will comply with its
leverage ratio and credit agreement for next year, Chief
Financial Officer Paul Keglevic said during a conference call
with investors today.  The company’s Texas Competitive Electric Holdings unit
expects a reduction of $660 million to $820 million to its 2013
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization from lower prices on contracts to lock in power-
generation margins and lower retail electricity sales, according
to the Dallas-based company’s investor  presentation slides .  Faced with power rates that have fallen by half since the
company was taken private in 2007 in the largest buyout in
history, Energy Future has sought to reduce its risk of default
by extending debt maturities and asking bondholders to swap
their holdings at discounted prices for new securities. Energy
Future has protected itself from a plunge in natural gas prices
with hedging contracts that begin to roll off next year.  “If low natural gas prices continue, they pose a
significant challenge to the company’s cash flows as we become
less hedged to natural gas prices,” Chief Executive Officer
 John Young  said during the conference call.  Secured Debt  The projected decrease in earnings will not threaten the
competitive unit’s covenant ratio in which secured debt must not
be more than 8 times adjusted EBITDA, Keglevic said. The
company’s secured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.59 to 1 as
of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing.  The company, formerly known as TXU, reported its third-
quarter loss narrowed to $407 million yesterday, from $710
million a year earlier. Sales fell 25 percent to $1.75 billion
on lower power prices and weaker demand due to milder summer
weather.  The company may need to restructure its balance sheet next
year as low gas prices, which help set the price of electricity,
have cut into the company’s cash flow, Moody’s Investors Service
said in a research note on Aug. 9.  Gas for December delivery fell 11.2 cents, or 2.9 percent,
to $3.691 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement price for the
contract month since Oct. 5. Gas has climbed 23 percent this
year.  The company’s $1.83 billion of 10.25 percent bonds due
November 2015 traded at 23 cents on the dollar on Oct. 25 from a
high of 88.5 cents in January 2010, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Energy Future was sold to a group led by  KKR & Co. (KKR)  and TPG
Capital in 2007, in a $43.2 billion cash transaction.  Energy Future’s units include Oncor, a regulated power-line
business; TXU Energy, a retail electricity seller with about 1.8
million customers; and Luminant, which owns more than 15,400
megawatts of generation capacity in Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
