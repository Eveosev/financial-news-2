Boeing Co. (BA)  won a commitment from
Aviation Capital Services LLC for 35 737 Max jets, marking the
first accord with a Russian company for the latest variation of
the world’s most widely flown  passenger jet .  Aviation Capital, a unit of State Corporation Russian
Technologies that is known as Rostech, is an aircraft leasing
company established in February 2011, and the commitment with
Boeing has a value of more than $3 billion, the companies said.  Boeing’s Max will feature more fuel-efficient engines and
will compete with Airbus SAS’s upgraded A320neo series after a
commercial debut now scheduled for 2017. Boeing, based in
 Chicago , has 858 orders for the 737 Max, after dominating this
year’s Farnborough Air show with the airliner.  “Russian airlines will gain an advantage on global markets
and will be able to increase their activity both within the
country and internationally,” the leasing company said in a
release.  The companies didn’t say which of two Max models were being
sold. The Rostech order will be added to Boeing’s official tally
once firm. The 737 Max 8 lists for $100.5 million, and the Max 9
for $107.3 million.  Purchase rights for 35 737s were part of a 2010 agreement
between Chicago-based Boeing and Rostech in which the Russian
company agreed to buy 50 single-aisle planes. Plane buyers
typically don’t pay catalog prices. The statement didn’t provide
information about Aviation Capital’s existing fleet.  To contact the reporters on this story:
