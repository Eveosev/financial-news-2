Chinese stocks  rose, sending the
benchmark index higher for the first time in four days, as an
advance by property developers overshadowed declines by auto-
related companies.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048)  and  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  led gains for
real-estate shares after the companies reported increased net
income for the third quarter. Liquor maker  Xinjiang Yilite
Industry Co. (600197)  jumped by the 10 percent daily limit after profit
surged in the third quarter. BYD Co., the automaker part-owned
by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., lost 1.2 percent
after saying full-year profit may tumble 98 percent.  “The market will probably stabilize at this level given
losses over the past few days and inexpensive valuations,” said
 Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Jingxi
Investment Management Co., which manages $120 million.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.2 percent to 2,062.35
at the close, snapping a three-day, 2.7 percent retreat. The  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 0.2 percent to 2,239.88. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong  fell
0.9 percent. Equity trading on U.S. exchanges will be canceled
for a second day as  Hurricane Sandy  bore down on  New York  City.  The Shanghai gauge is now within 2.8 percent from this
year’s closing low set on Sept. 26. The index has lost 6.2

median estimate of 24 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Fifty is
the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  Bank of America Corp. raised its China 2012 gross domestic
product growth forecast to 7.7 percent from 7.6 percent,
according to an e-mailed report from Lu Ting and Larry Hu,
economists at the  U.S. bank . It also raised the 2013 GDP growth
forecast to 8.1 percent from 7.6 percent.  A  gauge  tracking property stocks on the Shanghai Composite

market value, rose 2.5 percent to 10.98  yuan  after saying third-
quarter profit jumped 95 percent from a year earlier.  Gemdale, the fourth biggest, advanced 2.2 percent to 5.11
yuan after net income rose to 418 million yuan ($67 million) for
the three months ending on Sept. 30 from 1.54 million yuan a
year earlier.  Auto Earnings  Xinjiang Yilite surged 10 percent to 13.09 yuan. Third-
quarter profit jumped 297 percent from a year earlier, the

290 billion yuan of seven-day reverse repurchase agreements at a
yield of 3.35 percent and 105 billion yuan of 28-day contracts
at 3.6 percent, according to a trader who participates in the
auctions.  BYD slipped 1.2 percent to 14.18 yuan. The company said
yesterday that net income this year may fall as much as 98
percent, as a slowing global economy damps demand for its cars.
Third-quarter profit declined 94 percent.  Pang Da Automobile Trade Co. (601258) , China’s biggest listed auto
dealer, sank 7.4 percent to 5.10 yuan after posting a net loss
of 516 million yuan.  Cautious View  Some 706 companies in the Shanghai Composite have reported

Publicly traded companies are required to release results by the
end of the month.  Essence Securities Co, which was ranked No. 2 for equity
strategy research by New Fortune magazine last year, is cautious
on China’s stocks in November and December.  The securities regulator may resume a normal pace of share
sales after next month’s Communist Party Congress while small-
company equities and growth stocks may decline before the expiry
of so-called lock-up periods, Cheng Dinghua, an analyst at the
brokerage, wrote in a report dated yesterday.  More than 190 billion yuan worth of shares in 74 listed
companies will become tradable on the markets next month, the
