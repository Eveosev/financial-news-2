The Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association recommended a full open market
tomorrow in dollar-denominated fixed-income securities in the
U.S. after  Hurricane Sandy  closes the market for a day and a
half.  The suggestion followed the halting of trading of
government securities, mortgage- and asset-backed debt, over-
the-counter investment grade and high-yield corporate bonds,
municipal bonds and secondary money-market trading in bankers’
acceptances, commercial paper and Yankee and Euro certificates
of deposit that began at noon on Monday, the New York-based
 trade group  said in a  statement .  Sandy, the Atlantic’s largest-ever tropical storm, struck
the East Coast yesterday with a life-threatening surge, emptying
the streets of the nation’s largest cities and lashing a region
of 60 million with gales and rain. The storm, 900 miles across,
may cause as much as $20 billion in economic damages, according
to Eqecat Inc., a risk-management company in Oakland,
 California .  Sifma’s decision followed the announcement that U.S. equity
markets will reopen tomorrow after the longest weather-related
shutdown in more than a century. The decision was announced in
statements by NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and Bats
Global Markets Inc.  Editor: Kenneth Pringle  To contact the reporter on this story:
