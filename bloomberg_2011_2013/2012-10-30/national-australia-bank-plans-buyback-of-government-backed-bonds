National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the
nationâ€™s fourth-largest bank by market value, is seeking to buy
back bonds it sold with government backing in 2008 and 2009 amid
a global credit freeze.  The Melbourne-based bank offered to repurchase three lines
of Australian dollar-denominated notes comprising a combined
A$4.16 billion ($4.3 billion) of outstanding securities,
according to an e-mailed statement from HSBC Holdings Plc, which
is helping to manage the transactions. The lender is also
seeking to buy back $2.75 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated
guaranteed notes, according to a separate HSBC statement.  Australian banks including Westpac Banking Corp. and
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. have repurchased
government-backed notes as credit markets recovered, giving the
banks access to cheaper funding. There were A$82.9 billion of
outstanding bonds as of last month that still carried the
guarantee, which was announced by then-Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd 
in October 2008, according to a  federal website .  National Australia Bank is offering to buy back the
Australian dollar bonds at a spread of 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, below swap rates, according to the statement.
The offer applies to its 5.75 percent December 2013 securities,
floating-rate notes due January 2014 and 4.75 percent February
2014 debt.  The lender is seeking to repurchase the U.S. dollar fixed-
rate debt at a yield of 5 basis points less than the 0.25
percent Treasury due Oct. 31, 2014, while floating-rate
noteholders can sell their securities back to the bank for
$1,009.82 per $1,000 face value.  The Australian government charges a fee of 70 basis points
to 150 basis points a year to guarantee debt under its program,
depending on the credit rating of the borrower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
