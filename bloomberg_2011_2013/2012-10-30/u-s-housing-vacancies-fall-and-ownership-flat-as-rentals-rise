U.S. residential vacancy rates fell
in the third quarter as the growth in households outpaced
construction, the Census Bureau reported.  The rate for  rented homes  declined to 8.6 percent from 9.8
percent a year earlier while vacancies for  owner-occupied  houses
dropped to 1.9 percent from 2.4 percent a year earlier.
Homeownership was 65.5 percent, down from 66.3 percent a year
earlier and unchanged from the previous quarter.  Home starts jumped to an annual pace of 872,000 in
September as demand resurfaced following the worst housing
market crash since the 1930s, Commerce Department figures showed
on Oct. 17. The level was a four-year high. Residential prices
climbed in August by the most in two years as low  interest
rates , a diminishing supply of discounted foreclosed properties
and a growing economy spurred demand.  The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property values in 20 cities
rose 2 percent in August from a year earlier, the biggest annual
gain since July 2010, the group said today in  New York . The
median forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg survey projected
a 1.9 percent gain.  The total number of households increased by 1.15 million
over the past year to 114.7 million, according to the Census.  The U.S. homeownership rate peaked at 69.2 percent in July
2004, spurred by easy credit. It dipped to 65.4 percent in the
first quarter of 2012, the lowest since 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
