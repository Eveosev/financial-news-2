Fitch Ratings  cut Argentina’s credit
outlook to negative after a U.S. court ruling in favor of
holders of the country’s defaulted bonds increased concern the
government may not honor its debt.  Argentina’s B rating on its long- and short-term foreign
currency debt, which is five levels below investment grade, was
placed on credit watch negative, according to a statement today.
The local currency debt rating was affirmed at B.  The action “reflects increased uncertainty about
Argentina’s ability to service its international securities
issued under New York Law on a timely basis using the U.S.
financial system following the recent U.S. Appeals court
ruling,” analysts Lucila Broide and Santiago Mosquera wrote.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit in  New
York  ruled on Oct. 26 that Argentina can’t make payments on
restructured sovereign debt while refusing to pay holders of its
defaulted bonds because doing so would discriminate against
bondholders. The decision upheld orders issued by U.S. District
Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
