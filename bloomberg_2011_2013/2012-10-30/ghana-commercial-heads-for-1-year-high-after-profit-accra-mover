Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd. (GCB) , the
biggest lender by branch network in the West African nation,
headed for the highest in more than a year after saying profit
more than doubled in the nine months through Sept. 30.  The stock gained 1 percent to 2.05 cedis as of 2:34 p.m. in
the capital, Accra, the highest intraday level in almost two
weeks. A close at this price would be the highest since Oct. 10,
2011.  Net income rose to 87.6 million cedis ($47 million) from
38.3 million cedis a year earlier, the company said in a
statement e-mailed by the Ghana Stock Exchange today. Net
interest income, the money banks make from loans, increased 36
percent to 213.1 million cedis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
