The Detroit Tigers have extended
manager  Jim Leyland ’s contract through next season, two days
after being outscored 16-6 in a World Series sweep by the San
Francisco Giants.  Leyland, 67, will return for his 22nd season as a Major
League Baseball manager and eighth in Detroit, the team said in
an e-mailed release. His 1,676 wins are most among active
managers and 15th all-time.  “Jim is as fine a manager as there is in baseball, he has
done a fantastic job for the organization and we are thrilled to
have him back,” Tigers President and Chief Executive David Dombrowski said in the statement. “I am confident that you will
not find a harder working or better prepared manager in the
game.”  The Tigers have been to the playoffs three times since
Leyland took over before the 2006 season, and have won the
American League Central division each of the past two years.
Leyland also took the Tigers to the  World Series  in 2006, when
the team lost in five games to the St. Louis Cardinals.  The Tigers have also invited all six members of Leyland’s
coaching staff to return next season, the release said.  Leyland managed the 1997  Florida Marlins  to the World
Series championship.  To contact the reporters on this story:
