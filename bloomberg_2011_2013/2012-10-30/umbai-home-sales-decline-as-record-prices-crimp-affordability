Home sales in  Mumbai ,  India ’s most
expensive  property market , fell in the quarter ended September
as record prices crimped affordability, according to Liases
Foras Real Estate Rating & Research Pvt.  Sales slid 1.2 percent to 9.75 million square feet in the
three months ended Sept. 30 from the previous quarter, said
 Pankaj Kapoor , founder of  Liases Foras , a Mumbai-based real
estate research company. Prices in Mumbai rose 1.9 percent to a
record 11,385 rupees ($211) per square foot, he said.  “The Mumbai market has become inefficient, high prices are
hurting affordability,” Kapoor said in a telephone interview
from Mumbai yesterday. “Supply has increased but sales haven’t
kept pace.”  Mumbai’s efficiency index, which measures the impact on
demand given the increase in property prices, fell 6 percent to
11.66 in the quarter from the previous three months, Kapoor
said. The index is near a record low and compares with the high
of 85 in June 2009, he said.  India’s central bank left  interest rates  unchanged at 8
percent to fight price pressures while cutting lenders’ reserve
requirements to back a policy revamp by the government aimed at
reviving growth. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao reduced the  cash
reserve ratio  to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent, adding about 175
billion rupees to the banking system, the  Reserve Bank  of India
said in Mumbai today.  Sales in Hyderabad gained the most, increasing 46 percent
to 4.06 million square feet in the quarter after dropping to
their lowest levels in more than three years, data compiled by
Liases Foras showed. Prices in the city climbed 3 percent from
the previous quarter. Sales in the western Indian city of Pune
gained 27 percent to 11.31 million square feet.  Sales in the National Capital Region, which includes  New
Delhi  and its surrounding areas, rose 22 percent to 25.94
million square feet in the quarter, Liases Foras’s data showed.
The weighted average selling price rose to 4,123 rupees a square
foot, 11 percent higher than the previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
