CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL) , Southeast Asia’s
biggest developer, said third-quarter profit rose 85 percent as
it sold more homes and booked gains from the sale of serviced-
apartment buildings in  China .  Net income  climbed to S$148.5 million ($122 million) in the
three months ended Sept. 30, from S$80.2 million a year earlier,
it said in a statement to the Singapore stock exchange today.
That’s lower than the S$191 million mean estimate of three
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 13 percent to
S$686.9 million, the Singapore-based developer said.  “CapitaLand had a strong quarter,” Lau Wei Chong and
Sarah Wong, Singapore-based analysts at AmFraser Securities Pte,
said in a note today, maintaining their buy rating on the stock.
“Strong earnings were buoyed by divestment gains.”  The developer posted portfolio gains of $79.8 million from
the sale of its service residences Ascott Guangzhou and Ascott
Raffles Place to  Ascott Residence Trust (ART) , and the sale of its
entire 20.75 percent stake in United Malayan Land Bhd. Sales
from Singapore projects rose 7 percent to S$220.1 million,
mainly from the Interlace and Urban Resort Condominium, the
company said. Revenue from China accounted for $67.9 million, a
67 percent increase over the previous year, it said.  “China residential sales remained buoyant,” the analysts
said, adding that they expect the developer to deliver about
1,300 units in China in the fourth quarter, which could boost
profit.  CapitaLand Shares  The shares were unchanged at S$3.27 at the close of trading
in Singapore, after falling as much as 0.6 percent and rising as
much as 0.9 percent. The stock has gained 49 percent this year,
compared with the 15 percent advance in Singapore’s benchmark
 Straits Times Index. (FSSTI)   “Although global economic conditions have been volatile
and uncertain, we continue to explore and seize opportunities,”
Liew Mun Leong, president and chief executive officer of the
group, said in the statement. “Having invested substantially
over the past few years, we expect these investments to bear
fruits in the coming years.”  CapitaLand earlier this month named Chief Operating Officer
Lim Ming Yan as president and CEO when Liew retires next year
from the company he helped create almost 12 years ago.  Under Liew, CapitaLand expanded beyond the limited
Singapore market with a population of 5.3 million. China made up
38 percent of the company’s S$34.1 billion of assets as at Sept.
30, exceeding Singapore’s 32 percent, according to data from the
company.  Australia  contributed 17 percent.  Singapore Homes  CapitaLand’s Singapore home sales climbed to 329 units
valued at S$633 million in the nine months to Sept. 30, it said.
Residential sales in China gained 67 percent to about 2,000
units in the nine month period.  The developer has about 2,500 homes under development and
expects to sell as many as 1,000 units a year over the next two
to three years, it said in its annual report. Its three core
markets of Singapore, China and Australia accounted for 88
percent of the group’s revenue in the nine months ended Sept. 30.  CapitaLand committed a total of S$11 billion for new
investments last year, an 83 percent increase from the S$6
billion worth of investments made in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
