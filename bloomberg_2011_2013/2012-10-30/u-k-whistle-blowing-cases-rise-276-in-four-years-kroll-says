Whistle-blowing cases reported to
Britain’s financial regulator increased 276 percent in four
years, due partly to rising crime in developing markets, the
corporate investigations company Kroll Advisory Solutions said.  The Financial Services Authority received 3,733 calls to
its whistle-blowing helpline between June 2011 and May 2012,
compared to 994 such communications during the 2007-2008 period,
Kroll said in a statement today, citing information the company
obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.  Kroll said 18 percent of the company’s investigations in
the past year were started as a result of whistle-blowing. The
company blamed the increase on less-stringent controls in
overseas markets, the ease of creating fraudulent online
identities and better reporting capabilities for whistle-
blowers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
