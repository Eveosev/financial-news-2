Russian farmers harvested 48.5
million metric tons of grains and legumes as of Oct. 1, the
Federal State Statistics Service said.  That compares to 64.9 million tons a year earlier, the
service, known as Rosstat, said in an e-mailed statement today.
The figures exclude corn, it said. The crop was harvested from
25.3 million hectares (62.5 million acres), or 82 percent of the
sown area, the statement showed.  Yields dropped to 1.92 tons a hectare from 2.41 tons a
hectare a year earlier, Rosstat said. The figures are for
leading agricultural producers and exclude smaller farms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
