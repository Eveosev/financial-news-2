South  Korea ’s won strengthened to a
13-month high on speculation exporters sold the dollar to
convert overseas earnings. Government bonds advanced.  The won recovered from a loss of as much as 0.2 percent
earlier after official data showed today the current-account
surplus widened to $6.07 billion in September on increased
exports of cars and electronics. That was the second-biggest
excess on record. The Bank of Korea said today it is discussing
plans to review banks’ currency forward positions with the
Financial Supervisory Service, which may lead to regulation.  “There were some investors taking long positions on the
dollar after the central bank’s forward-position review
report,” said Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency dealer at
Daegu Bank. “Exporters selling the greenback supported the won
and triggered investors to cut their long positions.” A long
position is a bet an asset will rise in value.  The won appreciated 0.4 percent to 1,091.50 per dollar at
the close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 1,090.50 earlier, the strongest level since
Sept. 13, 2011. One-month implied volatility for the won, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.75 percent.  One of seven board members at the Bank of Korea opposed
cutting the benchmark interest rate to 2.75 percent from 3
percent on Oct. 11, according to minutes of the meeting released
today after financial markets had closed.  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent bonds due
September 2017 slipped one basis point to 2.85 percent, Korea
Exchange Inc. prices show. The one-year interest-rate swap was
little changed at 2.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
