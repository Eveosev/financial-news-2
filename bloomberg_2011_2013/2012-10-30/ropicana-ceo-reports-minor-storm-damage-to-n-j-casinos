Atlantic City  casinos sustained only
minor storm damage and could reopen by Nov. 1, according to
Anthony Rodio, president and chief executive officer of
 Tropicana Entertainment Inc. (TPCA)   Reopening will depend upon the lifting of mandatory curfew
and evacuation orders, Rodio said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television. As authorities assess the damage, casino operators
need a notice of about 24 hours to get staffs in place, he said.  “Even though none of the casinos sustained any significant
damage, we obviously are not in a position to reopen until the
state of emergency and evacuation orders have been lifted,”
said Rodio, who also heads the local casino operators’ group.
“The real question is the surrounding areas and infrastructure
and roads, and everything the state has to do in terms of
getting power back to the citizens and the streets and the roads
cleared.”  Gary Thompson, a spokesman for  Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR) ,
said some of the company’s four Atlantic City properties
incurred extensive wind damages to their roofs and local teams
were working to complete assessments and repairs. Caesars, based
in  Las Vegas , is the largest casino owner in Atlantic City.  Rodio said it was too early to assess the financial effect
on casino operators.  “There’s going to be a financial blow,” Rodio said. “But
it’s a one-time occurrence, and I think the investment community
and  Wall Street  understands that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
