Egypt  will receive two 60,000 metric
ton Ukrainian wheat shipments early to avoid any possible delays
in case the country introduces an export ban, the North African
nation’s state grain buyer said.  The vessels are supposed to load the grain and set off from
the export ports between Nov. 11 and Nov. 30, Nomani Nomani,
vice chairman of the North African country’s state-run General
Authority for Supply Commodities, said by phone in Cairo today.
The ships will now leave earlier, he said, without providing
further details.  Drought may cut harvests in Ukraine this year. The
agriculture ministry there has not yet decided whether to ban
wheat exports, a spokesman for Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said
on Oct. 24.  “Ukraine has exported 3.8 million tons of wheat so far but
all in all 5.4 million has been already contracted,” the
ministry said on the same day. “Those contracts can be
fulfilled.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
