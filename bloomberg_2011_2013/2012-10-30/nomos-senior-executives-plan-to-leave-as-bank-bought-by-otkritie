Four senior bankers at Nomos,
Russia’s second-biggest private lender, said they intend to
leave as the company is acquired by Otkritie Financial Corp.  Roman Pivkov, head of  investment banking , Artem Gavrilov,
head of foreign exchange,  interest rates  and money markets, and
Andrey Orlyanskiy, head of  portfolio management , all said by
phone that they plan to quit. Alexei Tretyakov, head of Nomos’s
financial operations department, said by e-mail that he plans to
leave by the end of the year.  Otkritie, which is 20 percent owned by state-run VTB Group,
plans to increase its holding in Nomos to 100 percent within two
years from 19.9 percent, the Moscow-based banks said in
statements on Aug. 31. VTB is providing Otkritie with a $1
billion loan for the deal, which may “indirectly” point to an
interest in acquiring Nomos, according to analysts at OAO
Sberbank.  Pivkov said his plan to leave was “related” to the bank’s
coming integration into Otkritie. Tretyakov said it would be
“difficult” to repeat the investment bank’s “strong”
performance once it’s integrated into Otkritie.  Alexander Dmitriev, a Moscow-based spokesman for Nomos,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
