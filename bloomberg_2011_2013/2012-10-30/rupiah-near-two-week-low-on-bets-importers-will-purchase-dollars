Indonesia ’s rupiah fell the most in
two weeks on speculation importers will step up dollar purchases
to meet month-end payments.  A decline in the currency is probably being curbed by fund
inflows into the nation’s bond market, said Veni Kriswandi, head
of trading at PT Bank Commonwealth. Indonesia plans to raise 500
billion rupiah ($52 million) by offering Islamic securities
today, after a debt auction last week drew bids for three times
the amount offered.  “The rupiah is going to be in a tight range,” said
Jakarta-based Kriswandi. “We have some offers coming because of
the sukuk auction going on today and we have the usual month-end
buyers of dollars.”  The rupiah dropped 0.2 percent to 9,630 per dollar as of
3:17 p.m. in Jakarta, compared with 9,609 yesterday, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The currency reached 9,656 yesterday, the weakest level
since Oct. 11. It has lost 5.8 percent this year, the worst
performance among Asia’s 11 most-active currencies. The rupiah
will probably trade between 9,615 and 9,630 today, she predicted.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, declined two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 6.23 percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
held at 5.72 percent today, according to prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
