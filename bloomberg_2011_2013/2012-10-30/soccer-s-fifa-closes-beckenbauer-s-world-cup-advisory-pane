Soccer’s governing body FIFA is
closing down an advisory group that was set up to suggest ways
of making the sport more attractive.  The FIFA Task Force Football 2014, led by World Cup-winning
captain and coach Franz Beckenbauer, was established last year
after the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. That tournament was
criticized for not matching the level of performances seen in
competitions such as the Champions League, and the group’s aim
was to improve matters before the World Cup in  Brazil  in 2014.  FIFA today said the group has concluded its work following
discussions on possible reforms. Beckenbauer and several other
members will now be amalgamated into the FIFA Football
Committee, a permanent standing body which will continue to
present proposals to improve the game, the governing body said.  FIFA’s Task Force 2014 was one of the core planks of Sepp Blatter’s bid to secure a fourth term as the organization’s
president, which he achieved in June last year. His only rival,
Mohamed Bin Hammam, withdrew shortly before the vote and has
since been suspended by the governing body.  In all, four FIFA task forces have concluded their mandates
to propose reforms, FIFA said. These resulted in measures
including the creation of a two-chamber ethics committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
