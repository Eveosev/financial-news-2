The level of hedging of power sales
by Vattenfall AB advanced to the highest in more than four
years, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The level hedged rose about 3 percentage points from the
previous quarter to 65 percent in the three months through
September, the most since New Energy Finance began tracking data
in the fourth quarter of 2007. The London-based research company
cited data published today on Vattenfallâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
