Bunge Ltd (BG) , the world’s second-
largest oilseed processor, has invested in Cobalt Technologies
Inc. and may install the biotechnology company’s equipment at
one of its Brazil sugar-cane mills to boost returns.  Bunge Global Innovation LLC has joined Cobalt’s series E
preferred stock round, Mountain View, California-based Cobalt
Technologies said today in a statement without disclosing the
size of the investment.  Cobalt has developed technology that produces n-butanol, a
four-carbon alcohol used in products like paints and lacquers
with a global market worth more than $5 billion. Several other
sugar-cane producers in Brazil including  Sao Martinho SA (SMTO3)  have
teamed up with biotechnology companies to turn crops into
specialty chemicals that achieve higher margins than ethanol
fuel.  “Cobalt’s promising technology presents the opportunity to
leverage Bunge’s sugar-cane processing assets to produce new
high-value products that diversify our revenue streams and
enhance returns,” Ben Pearcy, Bunge’s managing director, sugar
& bioenergy and chief development officer, said in the
statement.  The two companies are already working with specialty
chemical maker Rhodia SA to produce n-butanol from sugar-cane
waste at a pilot plant in Campinas, Brazil, according to the
statement.  Bunge, based in White Plains, New York, is developing a
plant with  Solazyme Inc. (SZYM)  that will turn cane into 100,000 tons
of oils a year that may be processed into detergents, according
to Bunge’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
