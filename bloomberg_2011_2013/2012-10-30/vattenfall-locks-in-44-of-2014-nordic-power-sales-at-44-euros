Vattenfall AB, the Nordic region’s
biggest utility, locked in 44 percent of its 2014 Nordic power
generation volumes at 44 euros ($57) per megawatt-hour at the
end of September, the company said.  Some 63 percent of power sales for  Germany  and the
Netherlands in 2014 had been sold in advance at 53 euros per
megawatt-hour, the company said in its earnings statement.  “We hedge less in the Nordic region due to volatility in
rain and snow volumes,” Oystein Loseth, CEO said in a
conference call. “When it comes to the weather in Scandinavia,
we never know what will happen.”  The Nordic region gets half its power needs from running
water through turbines. There is now 10 terawatt-hours more
water available for electricity production than on average for
this time of year, according to Markedskraft AS data on
Bloomberg.  For next year, 73 percent of Vattenfall’s projected Nordic
power sales were sold in advance at 46 euros a megawatt hour,
while 77 percent of sales for October through December this year
were locked in at 47 euros, the report said.  “We are relatively well hedged at reasonable prices for
this year and next in the Nordic region,” Loseth said.  The hedges show that Vattenfall has secured earnings above
prices of power derivatives on the Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s
energy exchange in Oslo, where the 2013 contract traded at 37.50
euros a megawatt-hour at 10:36 a.m., and the 2014 contract
traded at 38.80 euros yesterday.  For continental  Europe , the company had sold all of its
projected output in advance for this year and next, at 55 euros
a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
