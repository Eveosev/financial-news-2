Vietnam ’s central bank has drawn up
a plan to tackle non-performing loans at lenders as it attempts
to revamp the financial system which is saddled with the highest
level of bad debt in  Southeast Asia .  “In order to resolve banks’ bad debts, we need
determination and the solid will of the entire political
system,” central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh told legislators
at the National Assembly meeting in Hanoi today. The monetary
authority will submit its plan to the Communist Party’s
Politburo, Binh said, without giving a time frame.  Moody’s Investors Service cut Vietnam’s government bond
rating on Sept. 28, citing risks to the state’s balance sheet
from “weaknesses” in the banking system and lower growth
prospects. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung told the National
Assembly last week the government aims to complete a basic
restructuring of struggling lenders by the end of next year.  The ratio of non-performing loans in the banking system
stands at about 8 percent to 10 percent, according to a posting
on the central bank’s website last week. The monetary authority
aims to lower this number to below 3 percent by 2015, Binh said
today, adding that bad-debt growth has slowed since June.  The central bank plans to examine the accounts of 26
lenders as part of the restructuring process, Binh said.The
outcomes will be announced later, he said, without giving a time
frame.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
