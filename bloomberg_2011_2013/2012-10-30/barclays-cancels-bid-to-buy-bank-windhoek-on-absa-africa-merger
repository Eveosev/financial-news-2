Barclays Plc (BARC)  postponed a bid to buy
a controlling stake in Namibia’s Bank Windhoek from  Capricorn
Investment Holdings Ltd. (MRI)  until it completes a transaction that
will combine its African business with that of Absa Group Ltd.  Barclays and Johannesburg-based Absa announced talks on
Aug. 21 to merge their African units and complete a plan that
started seven years ago. The combination will affect assets in
Kenya, Botswana, Zambia, Tanzania and Ghana, the companies said.
Barclays, based in London, bought 54 percent of Absa in 2005 for
$4.5 billion to expand in emerging markets.  “Barclays and CIH have agreed to terminate negotiations
about Barclays acquiring a controlling stake in Bank Windhoek,”
the lender said in an e-mailed statement. “Barclays remains
open to possible future discussions with CIH once the proposed
combination of the majority of Barclays African businesses with
Absa is further progressed.”  Namibia ’s central bank approved Barclays’ acquisition of a
stake in Bank Windhoek in June, after declining a bid for the
lender by Absa last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
