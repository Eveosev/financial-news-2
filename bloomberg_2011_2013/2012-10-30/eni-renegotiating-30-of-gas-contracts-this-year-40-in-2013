Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest utility, is
renegotiating 30 percent of its natural gas contracts with
suppliers this year and a further 40 percent in 2013, according
to Chief Financial Officer Alessandro Bernini.  The company’s aim of improving operating profit compared
with 2011 relies a lot on the result of its renegotiations with
OAO Gazprom, he said on a conference call with investors
following the release of earnings today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
