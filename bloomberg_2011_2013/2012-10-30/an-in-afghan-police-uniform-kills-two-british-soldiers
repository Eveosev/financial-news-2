A man wearing an Afghan police
uniform shot dead two British soldiers in  Afghanistan ’s volatile
Helmand province, a local police official said today.  Col. Abdul Nabi Ilham, the police chief for the province,
said in a phone interview that an individual dressed in an
Afghan police uniform “opened fire on British soldiers in Nahr-
e-Seraj district of Helmand province, killing two British
soldiers.” The attacker managed to flee from the area, he said.  NATO’s International Security Assistance Force confirmed in
an e-mailed statement that two of its soldiers were killed by a
man in a police uniform. ISAF didn’t provide more information
about the attack or the nationality of the dead soldiers.  It wasn’t known immediately whether the killer had obtained
the uniform or was in the police, which would make it a so-
called green-on-blue attack. ISAF said earlier this month that
37 attacks by Afghans working alongside international partners
have claimed the lives of 51 coalition forces or contractors
this year, with a spike in such incidents in August. In all of
last year, 21 attacks killed 35 ISAF partners. In 2010, six
insider attacks killed 20 coalition members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
