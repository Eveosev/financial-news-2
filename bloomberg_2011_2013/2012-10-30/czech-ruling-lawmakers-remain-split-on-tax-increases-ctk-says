Czech Premier Petr Necas’s lawmakers
failed to agree today on backing a government bill that includes
tax increases ahead of a parliamentary debate on the proposal,
 CTK  newswire reported, citing deputy Marek Snajdr.  Six deputies from Necas’s Civic  Democratic Party , including
Snajdr, joined the opposition on Sept. 5 and voted against a
bill that included raising sales-tax rates and the introduction
of a new  tax rate  for high earners. The government submitted the
same bill to parliament again, tying its approval to a
confidence vote.  Talks among Necas’s lawmakers will continue before the
lower house of the legislature votes on the tax package, which
may take place as early as tomorrow, CTK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
