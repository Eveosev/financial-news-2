Latvia has filed legal-assistance
requests to countries including Lithuania, Russia and Ukraine
over the collapse of Latvijas Krajbanka AS, the  Baltic News
Service  reported, citing the state police.  The investigation into the bank, which was the country’s
sixth-biggest by deposits when it was seized by regulators in
November, may take a few years, said Gatis Gundermanis, chief of
the state police’s economic crimes division, according to BNS.
The police have also filed legal assistance requests to other
European countries, Gundermanis said, without identifying them,
BNS reported.  Latvian police have still not been able to question
 Vladimir Antonov , who controlled Krajbanka, Gundermanis said,
according to the Riga-based newswire.  -- Editors: Andrew Langley, Alan Crosby  To contact the reporter on this story:
