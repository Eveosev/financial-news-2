INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , a
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , said its
profit declined 35 percent in the first nine months of the year
after the refiner closed its Syrian operations in February.  Net income through September dropped to 1.54 billion kuna
($264 million), INA officials said at a press conference in
Zagreb today. Revenue was unchanged at 22.6 billion kuna, while
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
fell 30 percent to 3.69 billion kuna.  INA, whose profit almost doubled in 2011, is suffering from
the decision to pull out of its profit-driving gas and oil plant
in  Syria  on Feb. 27 to comply with European Union policy on the
Middle Eastern country, wracked by civil war.  Mol owns 49.1 percent of the Zagreb-based refiner, while
the government holds a 44.84 percent stake.  Croatia  in the last
two years has attempted to increase its influence in INA, after
Mol won controlling rights to Croatia’s largest refiner in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
