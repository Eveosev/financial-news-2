Taiwan ’s dollar gained for a second
day, trading near the strongest level in more than five months,
before an official report tomorrow that’s forecast to show the
island’s economy rebounded.  Government bonds  were steady.  Gross  domestic  product rose 1.5 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, after contracting 0.18 percent in
the previous three months, economists  predicted  in a Bloomberg
survey. Export orders, an indication of demand for shipments in
one to three months, rose 1.9 percent in September, the first
increase since February, figures showed on Oct. 19.  “Taiwan’s economy probably started recovering in
September,” said said Ma Tieying, an economist at DBS Group
Holdings Ltd. in  Singapore . “I expect a stable  Taiwan dollar 
looking forward as exports just recovered. The central bank
might want a more stable currency.”  Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.05 percent to NT$29.278 versus its
U.S. counterpart, data from Taipei Forex Inc. showed. It touched
NT$29.142 on Oct. 17, the strongest level since May 2.  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent to
NT$29.19 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, declined 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 3.51 percent.  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022 was
little changed at 1.14 percent in the secondary market,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.386
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
