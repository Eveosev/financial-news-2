The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 1 basis point to 125.5 basis
points as of 8:12 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge, which has traded between 112.6
basis points and 175.3 since June 30, is set for the highest
close since Oct. 15, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 1 to 147 as of
11:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking Corp. The
measure has traded between 132.4 basis points and 186 in the
second half, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 0.5 to 206.5 as of 9:11
a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The benchmark,
which has traded between 168.5 basis points and 229.5 since June
30, is on track for its lowest close since Oct. 25, according to
CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
