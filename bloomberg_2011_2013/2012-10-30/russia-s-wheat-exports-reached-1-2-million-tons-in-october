Russia , the world’s third-largest
 wheat exporter  last season, shipped almost 1.2 million metric
tons of the cereal in the first 24 days of October, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  Total grain exports reached almost 1.8 million tons in the
period, including 277,200 tons of barley, 257,100 tons of corn
and 57,800 tons of other grains, the ministry’s press service
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Grain exports for the season, which started July 1, reached
9.8 million tons, the ministry said.  Russia’s crops have been seared by drought this year.
Farmers harvested 72 million tons of grain before drying and
cleaning from 98 percent of the sown area as of Oct. 23, down 24
percent from a year earlier, according to the statement.  Yields fell 19 percent to 1.88 tons a hectare (2.47 acres)
compared with a year earlier, it said.  Grain stocks dropped about 27 percent to 35.8 million tons
as of Oct. 1 compared with a year earlier and are almost 14
percent down from the same date in 2010, it said.  Wheat for December delivery was down 0.3 percent at $8.555
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 8:50 p.m. Moscow time.
The price has advanced 31 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
