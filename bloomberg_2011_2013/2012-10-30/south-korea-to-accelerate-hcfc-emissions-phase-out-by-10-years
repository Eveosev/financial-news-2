South Korea  plans to phase out
emissions of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, by 2030, 10
years faster than agreed to under the  Montreal Protocol  on the
reduction of ozone-depleting substances.  The Korean government, adhering to the ozone-protection
rules of the Montreal Protocol, will next year start imposing
ceilings on the production and consumption of HCFCs, gases that
gained favor in the early 1990s as an alternative to
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, the  Ministry  of  Knowledge Economy 
said in an e-mailed statement.  While Korea was asked to phase HCFCs out by 2040, the
government will scale down the amounts companies are allowed to
use or import to zero by 2030, according to the statement.  The more than 190 states that ratified the Montreal
Protocol on ozone-depleting substances agreed in 2007 to a total
phase-out of the gases by 2030 in developed countries and by
2040 in poorer nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
