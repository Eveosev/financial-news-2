The U.K. Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards, which is examining the 2008 collapse of HBOS
Plc, appointed a legal counsel, David Quest, to act as a
specialist adviser with the power to examine witnesses.  “This commission panel will, for the first time, be using
counsel in a public evidence-gathering session today to cross-
examine witnesses,” chairman of the commission,  Andrew Tyrie ,
said in an e-mailed statement today. “This should help us to
get to the bottom of what went wrong and why. By doing so we
will be better placed to make recommendations for remedy.”  The decision to ask for legal counsel at a public inquiry
follows the appointment of lawyer Robert Jay by Judge Brian Leveson to examine witnesses in public over the culture,
practices and ethics in the press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
