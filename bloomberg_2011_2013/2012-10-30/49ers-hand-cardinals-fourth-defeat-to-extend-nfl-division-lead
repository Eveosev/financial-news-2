The  San Francisco 49ers  won 24-3 to
hand the division-rival Arizona Cardinals their fourth
consecutive defeat in the National Football League.  San Francisco quarterback  Alex Smith  threw two first-half
scoring passes to  Michael Crabtree  last night and also found
 Randy Moss  for a touchdown at University of Phoenix Stadium in
Glendale, Arizona.  “Crabtree made great plays, Randy on that touchdown made
me look good,” Smith said in a televised interview. “We
executed well tonight.”  San Francisco improved to 6-2 atop the National Football
Conference West Division. The Cardinals, who opened the season
with four straight wins, are tied for second place at 4-4 with
the Seattle Seahawks.  San Francisco led 17-0 at halftime as Smith found Crabtree
for three- and nine-yard touchdowns either side of a 43-yard
field goal by  David Akers .  It was 24-0 midway through the third quarter after Smith
tossed a pass to the 35-year-old Moss, who sprinted for a 47-
yard touchdown. It was the 155th career scoring reception for
Moss, tops among active players.  “Randy made a great play on the corner out there just to
get the first down,” Smith said. “All of a sudden he cut back,
broke a couple of tackles and took it to the house. He’s still
got it.”  Jay Feely completed the scoring with 58 seconds to play in
the third quarter with a 28-yard field goal for Arizona.  Smith completed 18 of his 19 pass attempts to finish with
232 yards. Cardinals quarterback John Skelton went 32-for-52 for
290 yards and one interception. Each quarterback was sacked four
times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
