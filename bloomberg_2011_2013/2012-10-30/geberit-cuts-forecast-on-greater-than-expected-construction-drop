Geberit AG (GEBN) , the Swiss maker of
toilets and bathroom piping systems, cut its revenue forecast
and said it expects “cloudy conditions” for the rest of the
year as sales dropped in  Italy  and at home.  The company cut the full-year target of currency-adjusted
sales growth to 3 to 4 percent, from an earlier prediction of 4
to 6 percent. Geberit, based in Rapperswil in  Switzerland ,
maintained its goal of earnings before interest, taxes,
amortization and depreciation in proportion to sales of 23
percent to 25 percent. Geberit fell as much as 8.5 percent.  Geberit “witnessed a decline in many markets and
regions,” the company said in a  statement . “Although expected,
this decline turned out to be much larger in magnitude than
forecast.”  The Swiss company said it predicts a drop in government-
financed construction amid slowing growth and continued
political and economic uncertainties in the next 12 months.  Net income fell 11 percent in the third quarter to 101.2
million francs ($108.2 million) missing the 125.5 million-franc
estimate of four analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg. Sales rose to
543.5 million francs from 533.3 million francs.  Geberit fell as much as 17.3 francs to 186.10 francs, the
most in more than a year, and traded at 186.1 francs as of 9:03
a.m. in Zurich. The stock has gained 2.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
