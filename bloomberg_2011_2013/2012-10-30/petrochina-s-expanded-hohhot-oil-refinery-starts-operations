PetroChina Co. (857)  started operations at
its expanded refinery in Hohhot in northwestern China with
annual crude-processing capacity of 5 million metric tons.  A cracking unit at the refinery with capacity of 2.8
million tons a year was started Oct. 28, China National
Petroleum Corp., the parent company,  said  on its website today.  Construction on the expansion started in August 2010 and
the plant was in a trial run since Sept. 8, CNPC said. The
initial operating rate will be around 60 percent when commercial
operations begin, Oilchem.net said last month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
