E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR) , a Hungarian
energy supplier, recorded the biggest three-day rally in more
than three years after buying back more of its overdue bonds.  The shares rose 15 percent to 435 forint by the close in
Budapest. The stock advanced 38 percent in the past three days,
the biggest gain since the three days through May 25, 2009.  E-Star bought back notes which expired on Oct. 24, with a
nominal value of 3.7 million forints ($17,000) at a gross rate
of 35 percent, the company said in a  statement  to the Budapest
Stock Exchange late yesterday. E-Star’s shares have rallied
since the company said last week it will use payments received
from the state to help buy back the overdue bonds.  “The question mark is whether remaining bondholders are
willing to accept” the 35 percent of nominal value, Peter Szentirmai, a Budapest-based analyst at  KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s broker
unit, wrote in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
