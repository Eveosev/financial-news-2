Vietnam ’s government bonds gained,
with the five-year yield sliding to a three-week low, after
interest rates fell at auctions. The dong was stable.  The State Treasury sold 2 trillion dong ($96 million) of
two-year notes at 9.7 percent, and 940 billion dong of three-
year securities at 9.85 percent yesterday, the Hanoi Stock
Exchange said in statement on its website. The rates compare
with 9.8 percent and 10 percent for similar-maturity debt at an
auction on Oct. 19.  “Declining interest rates at the bond auctions and in the
interbank market spurred investors to buy debt in the secondary
market, which dragged yields down,” said Hoang Thanh Tam, head
of the fixed-income department at Vietnam Maritime Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi.  The benchmark  five-year  yield fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 10.15 percent, the lowest since Oct.
5, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in Hanoi,
compared with 20,850 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
