Japan  shut down  Sendai airport  in
the northeast after construction workers found an undetonated
bomb believed to be from World War II near a runway.  A total of 92 domestic and international flights were
canceled after the 250-kilogram (550-pound) explosive was found
around 10:15 p.m. yesterday by workers at the southern end of
one of two runways, according to a statement from the Sendai
airport.  “Most of the unexploded bombs found were from the U.S. air
raids or left by the Japanese military during World War II,”
said Tomohiro Nozawa, a spokesman from  the Ground Self-Defense
Forces . The ministry has special teams throughout the country to
dispose of the explosives, he said.  Sendai airport is undergoing repairs after it was flooded
in the March 11, 2011, record earthquake and tsunami. Japan’s
Ministry of Defense handled 1,578 incidents involving bombs in
the fiscal year ended March 2012, amounting to 38.2 tons of
explosives, according to the government.  Japan Airlines Co. (9201) ,  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) ,  Air China Ltd. (753) ,
 China Southern Airlines Co. (1055) ,  Asiana Airlines Inc. (020560)  and Japan’s
Airdo serve Sendai airport.  To contact the reporters on this story:
