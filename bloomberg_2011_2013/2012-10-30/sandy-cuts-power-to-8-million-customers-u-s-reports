Superstorm Sandy knocked out power
to about 8 million homes and businesses in the U.S. Northeast
and forced three nuclear power units to shut, the Energy
Department said.  New Jersey today reported about 2.5 million customers
without electricity, the most in the region, and New York said
about 2 million customers lacked power, according to the
department.  The  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  said three nuclear units
were shut down, including  Entergy Corp. (ETR) â€™s Indian Point power
plant north of New York City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
