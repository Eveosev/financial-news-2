U.S. 10-year Treasury futures are
poised to decline to the lowest level in six months after
failing to climb above a key level of so-called resistance,
according to Credit Suisse AG said, citing trading patterns.  A “significant” hurdle is seen at 133 5/32 which
represents a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the slide
from the record-high 135 1/2 reached July 25 and the Oct. 25 low
at 131 22/32, the bank said in an emailed report today. The
contract will find support at 132 1/2, it said.  “We look for this to provide a ceiling, and to see a fresh
turn lower from here,” wrote Credit Suisse analysts including
London-based  David Sneddon , head of technical analysis research.  The Treasury 10-year note contract expiring in December
fell 0.1 percent to 132 20/32 as of 2:01 p.m. London time, after
rising to 133 2/32, the highest level since Oct. 16.  A break below 132 1/2 may target a move toward 131 19/32,
the analysts wrote. That’s the April 26 low, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Resistance refers to an area on a graph where analysts
expect sell orders may be grouped. Support is an area where buy
orders may be clustered. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a new high or low.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
