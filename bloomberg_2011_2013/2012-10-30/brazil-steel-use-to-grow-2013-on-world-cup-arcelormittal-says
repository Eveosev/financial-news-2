Brazil ’s steel demand will grow at
least 5 percent next year as the government prepares Rio de
Janeiro for the 2014 soccer World Cup and the 2016 Olympic
Games, according to  ArcelorMittal. (MT)   There is pent-up demand for steel used in stadiums and
other public works because some projects are behind schedule for
the two sporting events, Benjamin Baptista, who heads the Brazil
unit of the world’s largest steelmaker, said in an interview in
Santiago today.  “Things are this point are somewhat delayed,” Baptista
said. “We will see better volumes next year.”  Brazilian steel consumption will grow between 5 percent and
6 percent in 2013 after almost stagnant growth this year,
Baptista said.  ArcelorMittal (MT) , based in Luxembourg, continues to
maintain expansion projects in the South American country on
hold and may boost shipments in the domestic market by reducing
exports, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
