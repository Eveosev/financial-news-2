Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose to
their highest level in three weeks after the central bank left
borrowing costs unchanged last week, citing eased risk of a
global economic slump.  The yield on the 10 percent peso-denominated bonds due in
July 2024 climbed seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point,
to 6.16 percent, according to the central bank. That is the
highest level on a closing basis since Oct. 4. The bond’s price
fell 0.678 centavo to 131.333 centavos per peso.  “The tone of the central bank’s statement is much less
pessimistic,” said Pedro Ospina, an analyst at Interbolsa, the
nation’s biggest brokerage. “That reduces the chances of
another cut, which some had been expecting.”  Banco de la Republica, led by Jose Dario Uribe, held the
target lending  rate  at 4.75 percent on Oct. 26, matching the
forecasts of 28 of 35 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Seven
projected a reduction of a quarter-percentage point.  Uribe said the decision to keep borrowing costs unchanged
for a second month wasn’t unanimous. Policy makers have cut the
target rate twice since June from 5.25 percent.  Colombia will announce today the proposed tax rate foreign
holders of local peso bonds will pay if a bill sent to Congress
is approved, Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told reporters
yesterday.  The peso erased an earlier gain, declining 0.1 percent to
1,831.30 per dollar. The currency extended its drop this month
to 1.7 percent, the worst performance among the greenback’s six
major Latin American counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
