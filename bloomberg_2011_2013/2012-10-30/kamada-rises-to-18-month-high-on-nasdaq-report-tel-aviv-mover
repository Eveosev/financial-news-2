Kamada Ltd. (KMDA) , the biopharmaceuticals
producer, soared to the highest level in almost 18 months after
a newspaper reported the company is in talks with underwriters
for a share sale in the U.S.  The shares of the company that makes treatments for
hereditary lung diseases gained 6.3 percent to 30.81 shekels at
the close in Tel Aviv, the highest level since May 2011. The Nes
Ziona, Israel-based business may raise “tens of millions of
dollars” in the sale on the Nasdaq stock exchange, the Globes
reported without saying where it obtained the information.  “We don’t comment on rumors,” Chief Executive Officer
David Tsur said in a telephone interview. “The company has been
approached by investment bankers numerous times in the past and
once a decision is made we will update the market.”  The stock has gained 50 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 879 million shekels ($226 million).
Volume today was 752,168 shares, compared with the three-month
daily average of 78,324.  The company announced on Aug. 5 an agreement with Chiesi
Farmaceutici SpA for the exclusive distribution of the inhaled
version of its AAT medicine. Kamada said at the time it could
get $60 million if regulatory conditions and sales targets are
met and estimates sales potential of “hundreds of millions of
dollars.” The inhaled version is undergoing Phase II-III
testing in  Europe  and results are expected in 2013.  The company already sells an intravenous version of the
compound, used to treat patients with a genetic condition called
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency that can lead to liver and lung
damage, with  Baxter International Inc. (BAX)  Kamada expects 2012 sales
to rise to about 257 million shekels from  213 million shekels 
last year, the company  said  on April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
