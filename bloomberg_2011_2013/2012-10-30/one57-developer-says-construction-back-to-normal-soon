The developer of One57, the
Manhattan building where a construction crane partially
collapsed yesterday, expects to resume work on the tower in a
few days.  Sandy, the Atlantic superstorm that flooded parts of New
York City, will “delay things for a few days, and then
hopefully the situation will be back to normal,”  Gary Barnett ,
president of Extell Development Co., said in a telephone
interview.  Buildings near the site at 157 W. 57th St. were evacuated
and nearby streets were closed. The crane can’t be fully secured
until winds die down, New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  said at a
news conference today.  “The procedure will be to get the boom and strap it to the
building,” Bloomberg said, according to the New York Times.
“Then we can reopen the streets.”  He is the founder and
majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News .  Barnett declined to say how the crane, which is dangling
from near the top of the 90-floor tower, will be repaired.
That’s being handled by city officials, he said.  One57, set to be the tallest residential building in New
York, is scheduled to open for occupants in the middle of next
year. An 11,000-square-foot (1,000-square-meter) unit, spanning
the 89th and 90th floors, sold for about $90 million in May,
setting a record for a single residence in Manhattan.  Barnett said the storm shouldn’t change anyone’s plans for
development in Manhattan.  “We don’t usually have hurricanes in  New York City ,” he
said. “The city has to have new buildings built.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
