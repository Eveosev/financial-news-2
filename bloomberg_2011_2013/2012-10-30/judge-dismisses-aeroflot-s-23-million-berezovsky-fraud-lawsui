A U.K. judge threw out OAO
Aeroflot’s attempt to force  Boris Berezovsky , the self-exiled
former billionaire adviser to the late President  Boris Yeltsin ,
to re-pay money Russian prosecutors say he stole in the 1990s.  Aeroflot lacks jurisdiction to enforce payment of 720
million rubles ($23 million) by Berezovsky and Nikolai Glushkov,
a former executive at the carrier also living in the U.K., Judge
 Christopher Floyd  said in a written judgment today.  The lawsuit follows Berezovsky’s 2007 conviction by a
Russian court, in absentia, on allegations he used a Swiss
company, Andava SA, to embezzle money from state-controlled
Aeroflot, Russia’s largest airline. Berezovsky fled Russia in
2001 and didn’t return to fight the charges, which he says are
politically motivated.  Berezovsky “was pleased with the judgment,” his lawyer,
Garbhan Shanks, said in a telephone interview. Representatives
at Aeroflot didn’t return calls and an e-mail seeking comment.  Berezovsky has spent much of the year embroiled in disputes
with former business partners, fellow countrymen and friends
before British tribunals. In October, he lost one of the largest
civil suits ever in U.K. courts to Roman Abramovich, the owner
of Chelsea Football Club Ltd.  In a separate suit, Berezovsky agreed to drop a four-year-
old claim against the estate of his old business partner,  Badri Patarkatsishvili , who died in 2008.  The case is: Joint Stock Company “Aeroflot-Russian
Airlines” v. Boris Berezovsky & Anr, High Court of Justice,
 Chancery Division , HC12C00787.  To contact the reporter on this story:
