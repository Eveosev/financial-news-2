Ashaka Cement Plc (ASHAKACE) , a Nigerian unit
of  Lafarge SA (LG) , advanced the most in almost three weeks after
reporting a 50 percent jump in third-quarter profit.  The stock gained 5 percent to 17.91 naira at the close in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, the most since Oct. 10.
More than 500,000 shares changed hands, about 44 percent of the
three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The stock has risen 59 percent this year, compared
with a 29 percent rally in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  Net income for the period through September rose to 3.7
billion naira ($23.6 million) from 2.46 billion naira a year
earlier, the Gombe, northern Nigeria-based company said
yesterday. Revenue rose to 16.5 billion naira from 15.8 billion
naira.  “The stock is on full bid because of the impressive third-
quarter result,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of
Lambeth Trust and Investment Co. Ltd., said by phone from Lagos
today.  Ashaka’s earnings were buoyed by “other incomes” of 1.9
billion naira, “which we believe is largely from interest on
the company’s healthy cash position,” Pabina Yinkere, head of
research at Vetiva Capital Management Ltd, wrote in an e-mailed
note today. Profit was in line with Vetiva’s estimates,
according to Yinkere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
