U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron’s
spokesman said it is not “realistic” to expect a deal next
month at the European Union summit on its next seven-year
budget.  “We need to be realistic about the upcoming European
Council,” Steve Field told reporters in  London  today. “It’s
going to be challenging to get agreement at the forthcoming
European Council. We’re going into that negotiation with good
intentions. We want to try and reach a deal, but it needs to be
in our country’s interests.”  EU leaders will negotiate during a summit Nov. 22-23
in a 27-nation echo of the clashes over burden sharing that have
marked the 17-nation euro region’s effort to contain the debt
crisis.  Cameron says the budget should be frozen in real terms and
has repeatedly said he’d be prepared to use the British veto
unless he gets a “good deal.” At home, more than 30 lawmakers
from his own Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party
are calling for a real-terms budget cut.  Asked by reporters what would happen if a budget was not
agreed at the summit, Field replied, “The day afterwards,
nothing. The day after that? Not a great deal. The week after?
Not much.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
