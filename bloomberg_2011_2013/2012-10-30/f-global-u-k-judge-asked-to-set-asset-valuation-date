MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) ’s U.K.
administrators asked a judge to decide whether customer assets
held by the brokerage should be valued as of the day of its
collapse, a year ago tomorrow, or when they were liquidated.  KPMG LLP said it needs court guidance because about 700
customers would gain or lose on their trading positions,
depending on which method was applied, according to a  statement 
on its website.  At a two-day trial in London that began today, two
investors with claims in the administration were selected to
argue for and against the so-called hindsight principle.  Attestor Value Master Fund LP, a distressed-debt fund
registered in the  Cayman Islands , would see its claim increase
by about $3 million if valued on Oct. 31 of last year. On the
other side, Schneider Trading Associates Ltd.’s claim would lose
about $500,000 in value if tied to that date and not when the
securities were liquidated days later.  MF Global filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy when it
got margin calls and bank demands for money from its brokerage
after the company invested in distressed European sovereign
debt. KPMG, appointed to wind up its U.K. unit, by March had
recovered about $900 million of funds frozen in customer
accounts.  E-mails to Attestor’s lawyer and Schneider seeking comment
weren’t immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
