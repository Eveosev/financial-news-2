Rich Ross , the former head of  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) ’s film studios, was named chief executive officer of
Shine America, a TV production unit of News Corp. overseen by
Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth.  Ross succeeds Carl Fennessy, who is returning to Australia
after serving two years in the role, Shine America said today in
a  statement  on its website.  The 51-year-old Ross rose through the ranks of children’s
television programmers  Viacom Inc. (VIA) ’s Nickelodeon and Disney
Channel. His 2 1/2-year tenure as chairman of Disney’s film
studios ended in April shortly after the release of the science
fiction flop “John Carter.”  Shine, the maker of reality TV shows such as “Master
Chef” and “The Biggest Loser,” will  produce  drama series
pilot “The Bridge” for  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s FX cable network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
