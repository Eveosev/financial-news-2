Thailand ’s government  bonds  rose,
pushing the five-year yield to a nine-month low, as foreign
funds boosted holdings on concern global economic growth will
remain sluggish. The baht was little changed.  Overseas investors bought $1.4 billion more Thai government
debt than they sold this month, while reducing holdings of local
shares by a net $533 million, according to data from the Thai
Bond Market Association and the stock exchange. Thailand’s 10-
year yield is 3.3 percent, compared with 1.72 percent for
similar-maturity Treasuries. The Bank of Thailand cut its growth
forecast for 2013 to 4.6 percent last week from 5 percent,
citing falling demand for exports.  “With the weak external conditions, the outlook for
corporate profits and stocks is not so bright, while Thai bonds
still offer higher yields,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist
at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 dropped
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.05 percent as
of 3:07 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That was the lowest level since Jan. 10.  The baht traded at 30.72 per dollar from 30.73 yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 4.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
