Corp. (IBM)  increased its stock repurchase fund by 75 percent to $11.7
billion and said it plans to ask the board to authorize more in
April as it seeks to improve shareholder returns.  The company may buy shares in the open market or in private
transactions, according to a statement today. Armonk,  New York- 
based IBM spent more than $3 billion on share repurchases in
each of the first two quarters of this year, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is using record
income this year from the company’s shift to more profitable
software and services to reward shareholders whose stock has
been outpaced by the broader market. While the  Standard & Poor’s 
500 index has increased at more than double the rate of IBM
shares this year, the company’s  total return  including dividends
and buybacks is 14 percent, compared with 16 percent for the  S&P
500 .  IBM rose 0.9 percent to $193.27 on Oct. 26, the most recent
trading day. The stock market has been closed since yesterday
because of superstorm Sandy. The shares have climbed 5.1 percent
this year, compared with a 12 percent gain for the S&P 500.  IBM is  projected  to record net income of $17 billion this
year, up 7 percent from 2011, according to the average of
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The board also declared a quarterly dividend of 85 cents a
share to be paid Dec. 10, the company said. IBM last increased
its  dividend  in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
