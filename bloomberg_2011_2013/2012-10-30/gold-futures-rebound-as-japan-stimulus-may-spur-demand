Gold advanced for the first time in
three sessions on speculation that plans announced by  Japan  to
stimulate economic growth will boost demand for the precious
metal as an inflation hedge.  The  Bank of Japan (8301) , after a policy meeting today, announced
an expansion of its asset-purchase program by 11 trillion yen
($138 billion) to 66 trillion yen. Gold surged 11 percent in the
third quarter as central banks from  Europe  to  China  to the U.S.
pledged more stimulus to boost economies.  “News about more money printing in the system is perking
up gold,” Michael Smith, the president of T&K Futures & Options
in Port St. Lucie,  Florida , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,712.10 an ounce at 1:34 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, extending this year’s gain to 9.3 percent.  CME Group Inc., the owner of Comex, said the New York
trading floor was closed today for the second day after Sandy,
the Atlantic superstorm, slammed into the East Coast, driving
floodwaters to life-threatening levels and leaving millions of
people without power. The exchange’s Globex electronic trading
system remained open.  Silver futures for December delivery increased 0.2 percent
to $31.816 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for January delivery gained 1.3 percent to
$1,553.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery advanced 1.1
percent to $596.15 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
