An indicator of stress in short-
term, unsecured euro loans between banks rose, extending its
first weekly increase since June.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was 11.2
basis points, or 0.112 percentage point, at 10:02 a.m. in
 London , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s up from
10.4 on Oct. 26, which signalled the least stress in lending
markets since August 2007.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars increased.
The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks pay to
convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 25 basis points
below Euribor, from minus 24 at the end of last week.  The one-year basis swap increased to 25.5 basis points
below Euribor, from minus 24.5.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals increased to 0.089
percent from at 0.086 percent. The Eonia swap, an estimate of
average overnight borrowing costs over the next three months,
was at 9.1 basis points, from 9 basis points yesterday.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank  to 273 billion euros ($353 billion) from 267
billion euros on the final day of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
