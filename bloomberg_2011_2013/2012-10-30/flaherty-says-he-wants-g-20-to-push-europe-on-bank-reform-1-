Group of 20 officials meeting in
Mexico City this weekend should push European leaders to make
structural reforms, according to Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty.  The G-20 should hold discussions to “encourage our
European colleagues to get on with the structural reform that
needs to be accomplished in  Europe , including the banking
union,” Flaherty told reporters today in Ottawa.  G-20 officials should also urge U.S. lawmakers to address
the so-called fiscal cliff of $607 billion in federal spending
cuts and tax increases scheduled to take effect in January
unless Congress acts, Flaherty said. The finance minister was
speaking today to reporters in Ottawa.  “We want to certainly encourage our American friends to
get on the issue of the fiscal cliff as soon as possible after
the U.S. election,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
