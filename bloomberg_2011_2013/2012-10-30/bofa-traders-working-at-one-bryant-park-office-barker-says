Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, said trading personnel are
working at its main  New York  office at 1 Bryant Park today to
help clients coping with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.  “We do have a trading organization that needs to function
as long as markets are open somewhere in the world and we are
able to accommodate them,” Jeff Barker, New York City market
president for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company, said
in a Bloomberg Television interview. “There is a group working
there today.”  The bank’s charitable arm will donate $1 million to
disaster-relief efforts, including an immediate $500,000 for the
American Red Cross, Barker said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
