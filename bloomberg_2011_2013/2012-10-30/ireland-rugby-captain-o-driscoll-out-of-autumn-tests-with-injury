Brian O’Driscoll  will miss the
Ireland rugby team’s autumn Test schedule with an ankle injury
that requires surgery.  Captain O’Driscoll damaged ligaments playing for his club
Leinster against the Cardiff Blues last weekend and will be
sidelined eight to 12 weeks after the surgery, the Irish Rugby
Football Union said on its  website .  Rory Best will also miss the series after spraining neck
ligaments playing for Ulster against the Dragons. The hooker
faces up to six weeks of rehabilitation before the injury is
reassessed.  Ireland hosts Test matches against South Africa on Nov. 10
and Argentina on Nov. 24, while an Ireland XV hosts Fiji on Nov.
