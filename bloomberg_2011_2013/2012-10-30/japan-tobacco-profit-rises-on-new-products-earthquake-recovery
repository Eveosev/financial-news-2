Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) ,  Asia ’s largest
cigarette maker by market value, reported an 18 percent rise in
first-half profit, aided by new domestic products and a recovery
from last year’s earthquake.  Net income rose to 168.8 billion yen ($2.1 billion) for the
six months ended September, from 143.6 billion yen a year
earlier, according to a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange
yesterday. The company maintained its profit forecast of 318
billion yen for the full year to March 2013.  The Tokyo-based cigarette maker has introduced  new products 
such as “Pianissimo Precia Dia’s Menthol” as it faces a
shrinking domestic market. Japan Tobacco’s market share
increased to 60 percent during the six-month period from 51
percent a year earlier as sales recovered from the March 2011
earthquake, it said yesterday.  Japan  Tobacco shares closed 2.4 percent lower to 2,239 yen
ahead of the earnings announcement yesterday. The stock climbed
24 percent for the year, compared with a 0.7 percent gain for
the broader Topix index. The company cut its full-year sales
forecast by 1.3 percent to 2.1 trillion yen, according to the
statement.  Domestic tobacco sales rose 14 percent to 350.7 billion yen
during the first half, while international sales increased 3
percent to 490.2 billion yen, the company said yesterday.  Europe Slowdown  Sales volume in south and west Europe fell 4.8 percent in
the three months to September, as markets in  Italy  and  Spain 
continued to shrink on slowing economies, the cigarette seller
said in a statement yesterday.  “We should watch for the sales volume in  Europe  in terms
of the current European economic situation,” said Junichi Kanamori, analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities
Co.  Japan Tobacco in August said it will change the name of
Japan’s best-selling “Mild Seven” cigarettes to “Mevius.” It
would be the first time the company changed the name since it
started selling the product in 1977.  A law passed last year allowed the Japanese government, the
cigarette maker’s biggest shareholder, to sell one-third of its
entire holding to help pay for earthquake rebuilding. The
government owns 50 percent of Japan Tobacco, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan Tobacco is considering buying back as much as 250
billion yen of its shares if the government sells its shares
this fiscal year, the company has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
