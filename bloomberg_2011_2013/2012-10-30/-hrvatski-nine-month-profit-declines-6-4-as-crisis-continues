T-Hrvatski Telekom d.d. , the
Croatian unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , said net income for the
first nine months declined 6.4 percent to 1.39 billion kuna
($239 million) as  Europe ’s crisis erode business.  Revenue decreased 7.1 percent to 5.66 billion kuna, while
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
or Ebitda, declined 6.7 percent to 2.61 billion kuna, the
country’s biggest communications services provider said in a
statement on the Regulatory News Service today.  “The economic environment in  Croatia  remains sluggish,”
increasing “unemployment and higher inflation,” Chief
Executive Officer Ivica Mudrinic said in the statement. “At the
same time, competition remains intense and the regulatory regime
remains tight.”  The phone company faces increased pressure on disposable
income by rising unemployment and faster inflation, forcing it
to “somewhat decrease” its financial expectations for the
year.  “Results were weaker than expected and the trends are not
encouraging either,” Attila Gyurcsik, an analyst at Concorde
Securities Ltd., said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
