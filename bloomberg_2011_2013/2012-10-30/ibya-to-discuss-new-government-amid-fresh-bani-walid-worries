Libyan lawmakers will today discuss
the Cabinet nominees to be presented by Prime Minister-elect Ali Zaidan, whose predecessor twice failed to win parliament’s
backing for his proposed government.  The meeting, announced by parliament spokesman Omar
Hamaidan in remarks carried on the Libya News Agency, comes as
authorities struggle to contain unrest and violence a year after
Muammar Qaddafi’s death.  Reflecting the unease in the country, Defense Minister
Osama Jweli said late yesterday the government had no control
over Bani Walid, a pro-Qaddafi stronghold about 190 kilometers
(118 miles) southeast of Tripoli, where thousands of people have
been displaced amid heavy fighting.  Jweli said he objected to the use of militias in the
operation in Bani Walid to capture those wanted in connection
with the death of a former rebel credited with Qaddafi’s capture
last year. Militias from the Libya Shield, an umbrella group of
government-allied fighters, were involved in the operation.  Jweli said he and troops accompanying him had been denied
access to the town on Oct. 28, showing that “the chief of staff
of the Libyan army has no control over Libya Shield forces.”  Days earlier, authorities said they had secured control
over Bani Walid in an operation that left dozens of troops and
fighters dead or wounded.  Zaidan was appointed premier on Oct. 14 by the National
Congress. His predecessor, Mustafa Abushagur, held the post for
less than a month before he was pushed out by lawmakers who
refused to give approval to his proposed Cabinet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
