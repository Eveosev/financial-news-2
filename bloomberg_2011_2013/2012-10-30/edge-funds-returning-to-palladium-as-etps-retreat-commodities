Hedge funds are siding with analysts
predicting decade-high palladium prices even as investors cut
holdings in exchange-traded products backed by this year’s
worst-performing precious metal.  The funds’ wagers on a rally more than doubled since August
as ETP holdings slumped to a seven-month low this month, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices for the metal used mostly in
catalytic converters will average $800 an ounce in the third
quarter, 34 percent more than now and the highest since 2001,
based on the median of 13 analyst estimates.  Speculators that slashed bets to the lowest level since
2009 in May as growth slowed are now more bullish after central
banks from the U.S. to Europe to  China  pledged additional
measures to boost economies. Palladium’s 9 percent retreat this
year contrasts with a 10 percent advance in platinum, driven by
mine strikes and violence in South Africa, the biggest producer
of the metal also used in autocatalysts.  “Platinum got the South Africa boost but palladium didn’t
enjoy that,” said Jeffrey Sica, the Morristown, New Jersey-
based president of SICA Wealth Management, who helps oversee
more than $1 billion of assets. “I do anticipate higher prices
because of the global liquidity push. At some point there will
be growth revival.”  Annual Shortage  Palladium is retreating for a second year and traded at
$596.50 in  London  today. Gold gained 9.4 percent and silver 14
percent since the start of January. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
gauge of 24 commodities fell 1.3 percent and the MSCI All-
Country World  Index (MXWD)  of equities gained 9.8 percent. Treasuries
returned 1.9 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Demand will rise 1.4 percent to 9.67 million ounces next
year, the second-highest ever, as supply gains 3.2 percent to
9.59 million ounces, Barclays Plc estimates. Morgan Stanley is
also predicting a second consecutive annual shortage in 2013.  That may grow as South African strikes spread. Police shot
34 protestors at Lonmin Plc’s Marikana mine on Aug. 16 amid the
worst violence in the mining industry since the end of apartheid
in 1991. The country produces 75 percent of the world’s platinum
and 35 percent of its palladium. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. and Gold
Fields Ltd. began firing more than 20,000 workers this month as
ultimatums passed for employees to return for duty.  The Federal Reserve said Sept. 13 it will buy $40 billion
of mortgage debt a month and central banks in  Europe  and  Japan 
have also pledged to buy more assets. China, the biggest
palladium user, approved a $158 billion subways-to-roads
construction plan. The nation’s growth will accelerate in this
and the next three quarters, after slowing since the start of
2011, based on the median of as many as 31 economist estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Central Banks  The central bank stimulus may bolster demand for cars,
which account for 40 percent of platinum demand and 66 percent
of palladium consumption. Worldwide sales of cars and light
commercial vehicles will rise 5.3 percent to a record 85.3
million units next year, according to LMC Automotive Ltd., a
research company in Oxford,  England .  Hedge funds and other large  speculators  held a net-long
position of 7,723 palladium futures and options by Oct. 23, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. While that’s
down from 10,536 contracts on Oct. 9, the most since March, it
compares with 2,436 contracts held in May, the least according
to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to December 2009.  That reversal has yet to be reflected in ETPs, which fell
4.2 percent to 59.5 metric tons valued at $1.14 billion since
mid-June. They rose for the first time since September
yesterday. Holdings in platinum products jumped 12 percent,
those in silver expanded 5.1 percent and gold rose 8.7 percent
since mid-June, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  World War  The drop in palladium reflected mounting concern about
growth. Demand contracted in 2008 and 2009 as the global economy
endured its deepest slump since World War II. The International
Monetary Fund cut its forecast for next year to 3.6 percent from
3.9 percent on Oct. 9. The 17-nation euro area will contract 0.4
percent in 2012, the Washington-based group estimates.  “If we see another recession, or if growth rates won’t be
as high as forecasts are, you could see smaller demand,” said
 Thorsten Proettel , an analyst at Landesbank Baden Wuerttemberg
in Stuttgart,  Germany . “We’ll need more demand or supply
interruptions for higher prices and I wouldn’t expect both for
the next year.”  While analysts expect another year of shortages in 2013, it
will be smaller than in 2012, with Barclays predicting a
narrowing to 78,000 ounces from 234,000 ounces. There may be 6
million to 9 million ounces stockpiled globally, according to
Standard Bank Plc, with the higher figure equal to almost 16
months of mine production.  Norilsk Nickel  About 150,000 to 200,000 ounces of palladium production may
be lost this year because of unrest in South Africa, as well as
300,000 to 400,000 ounces of platinum, said Anton Berlin, deputy
chief executive officer of the sales unit of OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel. The Moscow-based company is the world’s biggest
palladium producer.  Sales from Russian state stockpiles, which reached 1
million ounces as recently as 2010, will decline to 150,000
ounces next year, Barclays estimates. The reserves, a state
secret, are probably almost depleted, according to London-based
Johnson Matthey Plc, the maker of one in three autocatalysts.  Palladium is trading 47 percent below its 2001 record of
$1,125 and 61 percent below the price of platinum. That’s
spurring carmakers to use more in autocatalysts, canisters that
have honeycomb-like surfaces converting emissions into less
harmful substances. Palladium accounted for about 30 percent of
the metal in catalytic converters for diesel vehicles last year,
from 20 percent in 2009, Johnson Matthey estimates.  Rhodium Market  Rhodium, another precious metal used in autocatalysts, fell
20 percent this year to $1,125 an ounce, Johnson Matthey data
show. The rhodium market is about 10 percent of the size of
palladium, based on demand. Deutsche Bank AG introduced ETPs
backed by rhodium in May 2011 and they now hold 46,900 ounces
valued at about $50 million, according to data from the
Frankfurt-based bank.  Carmakers will use a record 6.54 million ounces of
palladium next year, Barclays estimates. Demand from other
industrial applications including dental, electrical and glass
manufacturing will rise 3.7 percent to 2.64 million ounces, the
bank predicts.  Norilsk Nickel  Shares of Norilsk Nickel fell 3.4 percent this year and
will gain 25 percent to 5,951 rubles ($190) in the next 12
months, according to the average of 10 analyst forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg. The company will report a 7.9 percent
gain in profit to $3.24 billion in 2013, the mean of five
estimates shows.  “If you are a little bit more long-term orientated and not
just focused on the next two or three months, then it is a good
buying opportunity,” said  Daniel Briesemann , a commodities
analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “Lower supply from
 Russia  and recovering demand from the auto industry in at least
Asia and America should be the main driving factors behind
rising prices.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
