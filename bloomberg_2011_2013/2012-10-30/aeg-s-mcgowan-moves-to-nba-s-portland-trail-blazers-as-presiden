Chris McGowan is moving from AEG
Sports to the National Basketball Association’s Portland Trail
Blazers as president and chief executive officer.  McGowan was chief operating officer of Los Angeles-based
AEG Sports, which owns the Los Angeles Kings of the National
Hockey League and the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer.  “It’s a great day for the Portland Trail Blazers as we
welcome Chris to the northwest,” team owner  Paul Allen  said
yesterday in a news release. “With his demonstrated leadership
with the Kings and Galaxy, I’m confident he’ll find ways to
improve the Blazers’ business performance, which is key to the
team’s overall success.”  McGowan replaces  Larry Miller , who resigned as the team’s
president in July to return to  Nike Inc. (NKE)  McGowan will manage all
business operations of the team and the Rose Garden, the Trail
Blazers’ arena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
