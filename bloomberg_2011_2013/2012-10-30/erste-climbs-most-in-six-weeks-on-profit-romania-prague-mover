Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  jumped the most
in more than six weeks after the company said it returned to
profit, helped by “stabilization” in its Romanian business.  The stock rose 4.8 percent to 472.50 koruna by the close in
 Prague , the steepest gain since Sept. 14. It was the best
performer in the Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  equity index today, where
Erste has a 23 percent weighting. Turnover in the lender’s
shares was 146 percent of its three-month daily average volume,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income for July to September swung to 143.7 million
euros ($186 million) from a 1.5 billion-euro loss a year
earlier, the bank said today. Erste posted its first loss last
year since at least 1988 on account of bad loans, writedowns and
losses related to credit default swaps in Romania and Hungary.
The Romanian unit will return to profit in 2013 after margins
and non-performing loans improved in the third quarter, the
company said.  “They are trying to push the Romania story, the outlook is
a bit better than what I expected,” said  Ronny Rehn , an analyst
at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London, who rates Erste market
perform. “It looks like it might get better a little quicker.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
