Takahiro Sekido, who worked at the
 Bank of Japan (8301)  for more than a decade before becoming a
strategist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., said the
central bank will become more receptive to political pressure
for monetary easing.  The BOJ and Japanese government said in a joint  statement 
today that they will work together to overcome deflation. BOJ
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank aims to achieve
its 1 percent inflation goal through “powerful monetary
easing,” while Economy Minister Seiji Maehara and Finance
Minister Koriki Jojima said the government will formulate
measures to counter downside risks to the economy.  The central bank today added 11 trillion yen ($139 billion)
to its 55 trillion-yen asset-purchase program, its main policy
tool. The government “strongly” expects the BOJ to continue
powerful monetary easing, the statement said.  The yen rose after the central bank’s decision, and was up
0.5 percent to 79.42 per dollar as of 9:15 a.m. in  London .  “It’s significant for the BOJ and government to make a
written commitment to cooperation” in overcoming deflation,
Sekido said.  “Political pressure will remain strong on the central bank
to ease policy further, but today’s statement confirms that the
BOJ will become more receptive to that pressure.”  “It means the BOJ will take a more accommodative stance.”  “Once markets fully digest the implications of today’s
announcement, the BOJ’s policy will lead to mild weakness in the
yen.”  “Today’s move will limit the upside risk to  Japan ’s
government bond yields.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
