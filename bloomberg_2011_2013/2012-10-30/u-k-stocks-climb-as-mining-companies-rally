U.K. stocks  advanced the most in two
weeks as  BP Plc (BP/)  reported earnings that exceeded analysts’
estimates and mining companies rebounded with metal prices.  BP jumped 4.2 percent after  Europe ’s second-largest oil
company also increased its dividend payout. Rio Tinto Group rose
2 percent as copper climbed from an eight-week low.  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)  gained 1.8 percent after announcing a plan to expand its
Australian iron-ore operations.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index added 54.8 points, or 1 percent, to
5,849.9 at the close in  London , its biggest rally since Oct. 16.
The benchmark measure fell yesterday as Hurricane Sandy prompted
the U.S. to suspend all equity trading. The volume of shares
changing hands on the FTSE 100 has been at least 40 percent
lower than the 30-day average for the last two days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’ve seen strength in the mining companies as well as BP
earnings, so you are looking at a good 30 percent of the index
moving higher today,” Richard Hunter, head of U.K. equities at
Hargreaves Lansdown Plc said in a telephone interview from
London. “Stepping back from that, volumes are extremely light.
With the U.S. closed for a second day, there is an element of
the market that is not taking part. I don’t think today
represents a return to risk on.”  The broader FTSE All-Share Index climbed 0.8 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 1.1 percent. The U.S. canceled
stock trading for a second day after  Hurricane Sandy  struck the
east coast.  BP, Shell  BP jumped 4.2 percent to 442.85 pence after the oil company
reported an 8 percent increase in  third-quarter net income  to
$5.4 billion as underlying earnings in its refining and
marketing unit rose to a record. Adjusted profit of $5.2 billion
compared with earnings of $5.5 billion a year earlier. The
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey had called for
profit of $4 billion on the same basis. BP also raised its
 dividend  by 12.5 percent to 9 cents a share.  Royal Dutch Shell Group Plc,  Europe’s biggest oil company ,
rose 1.6 percent to 2,140.5 pence  A gauge of mining companies increased 1.1 percent after
copper rallied from its lowest price since Sept. 4 on the London
Metal Exchange.  Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest mining company,
climbed 2 percent to 3,142.5 pence.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  also
gained 2 percent to 1,150 pence, while  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  rose 1.4
percent to 981.8 pence.  BHP Billiton  BHP added 1.8 percent to 2,010 pence. The  world’s largest
mining company  plans to spend more than $6 billion to increase
production of iron ore to more than 175 million metric tons in
the year ending June 30, according to Marcus Randolph, the
Melbourne-based company’s chief executive officer of ferrous and
coal. BHP allocated about $4.5 billion to expand ore production
in fiscal 2012.  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT)  gained 1.6 percent to 2,370
pence.  Europe’s second-largest cigarette maker  reported full-
year adjusted operating profit of 3.16 billion pounds ($5.1
billion), compared with 3.1 billion pounds a year earlier. The
average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had
called for profit of 3.19 billion pounds.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  gained 3.4 percent to 238.8 pence before the
 bank reports  earnings tomorrow morning. Britain’s second-biggest
bank may say pretax profit rose 25 percent to 1.67 billion
pounds in the third quarter, according to the  median analyst
estimate , as revenue from the fixed-income arm of its securities
unit jumped.  The results will be the first for  Antony Jenkins , who took
over as chief executive officer in August after Barclays was
fined a record 290 million pounds for manipulating Libor.  Quintain Gains  Quintain Estates & Development Plc (QED)  climbed 1.9 percent to
54 pence. The company’s biggest shareholder, Laxey Partners
Ltd., sold a 10 percent stake in the British property developer,
according to a person familiar with the transaction. Numis
Securities Ltd. placed 53 million shares at 53 pence apiece on
behalf of Laxey, a separate person said.  Standard Chartered Plc slid 0.9 percent to 1,483.5 pence.
The shares fell as much as 2.7 percent after the bank said
operating profit in the first nine months rose by a “mid-
single-digit” rate as growth in Asia slowed.  The lender also said that revenue grew at a “high-single-
digit rate, maintaining the trajectory seen in the first half.”
In August,  Standard Chartered (STAN)  forecast full-year revenue growth
of at least 10 percent.  Centamin Plc (CEY)  plunged 35 percent to 63.8 pence before the
shares were suspended from trading. The stock slumped the most
since its initial public offering in 2001 after  Egypt ’s
Administrative court annulled the company’s contract to extract
gold from the Sukari mine. The state-run Egyptian Mineral
Resources Authority failed to exercise sufficient oversight of
the facility, the court said in a faxed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
