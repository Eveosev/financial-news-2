CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s largest
electricity producer, asked Czech Coal AS and Energeticky and
Prumyslovy Holding to submit new bids for its coal-fired power
plants,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing Alan Svoboda, CEZ
trading director.  Existing bids by Czech Coal and EPH, which expire on Oct.
31, didn’t conform to tender documentation, Hospodarske said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
