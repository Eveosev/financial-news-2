Nigeria’s naira headed for its
highest level in three weeks on speculation of increased
portfolio inflows and oil company dollar sales.  The naira strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 156.975 a
dollar by 11:05 a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, poised
for the highest close since Oct. 8. The currency of  Africa ’s
largest oil producer has increased 3.4 percent this year, the
second-best performer on the continent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The trend in naira strengthening since mid-June mainly
reflects robust capital inflows seeking to buy high yielding
government securities,” Ecobank Transnational Inc. strategists,
led by Paul-Harry Aithnard in Paris, wrote in a note to clients
today. The naira is also receiving some support from “dollar
supplies by oil companies,” the strategists wrote.  Borrowing costs for Nigeria’s federal government dropped
after JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced in August that it will add
the country’s bonds to its GBI-EM index series from Oct. 1. The
yield on the 16.39 percent naira debt due 2022 has dropped 280
basis points to 13.33 percent since the start of August,
according to yesterday’s prices compiled by the Lagos-based
Financial Markets Dealers Association.  The yield on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 declined two basis points to 4.55 percent today.  Reserve Requirements  The central bank, led by Governor Lamido Sanusi, has left
the benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record 12 percent
this year. The regulator increased reserve requirements for
banks to 12 percent of assets from 8 percent after its monetary
policy committee meeting on July 24. A week later, it limited
access to twice-a-week foreign-exchange auctions to stop dealers
from buying foreign currency using naira purchased from the
central bank at a discount.  Nigeria’s  foreign reserves  increased 28 percent this year
to $42.2 billion by Oct. 23, according to data compiled by the
Central Bank of Nigeria. The West African nation’s benchmark
 Bonny Light crude  has advanced 22 percent to $110.08 a barrel
since hitting its lowest this year in June.  Ghana ’s cedi strengthened for a second day, appreciating
less than 0.1 percent to 1.8765 a dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
