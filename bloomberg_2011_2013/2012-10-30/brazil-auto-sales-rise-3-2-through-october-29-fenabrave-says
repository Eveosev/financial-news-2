Sales of vehicles excluding trucks
and buses in  Brazil  have risen 3.2 percent in October from a
month earlier and 8.6 percent from a year earlier, according to
preliminary data from Brazil’s car dealership association
 Fenabrave .  Sales of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles were
286,483 units through yesterday, compared with 277,614 units
sold in September and 263,819 at the same month last year,
according to Fenabrave’s website.  President  Dilma Rousseff  announced on Oct. 24 a decision to
extend until the end of the year the tax cuts on car purchases,
which were scheduled to expire at the end of October.  The measure has helped fuel a rebound in car sales and
economic growth in the third quarter, after purchases fell 31
percent in September from a record 420,080 in August.  “We don’t want any price increases at the end of the
year,” Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told reporters on Oct.
24. “If we suspend the exemption, companies are probably going
to increase prices in November and December. We want prices to
remain low.”  This extension of the IPI tax cuts is “probably” the last
one, Mantega said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
