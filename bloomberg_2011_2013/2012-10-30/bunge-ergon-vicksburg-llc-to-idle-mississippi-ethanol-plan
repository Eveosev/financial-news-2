Bunge-Ergon Vicksburg LLC plans to
idle its  Mississippi  ethanol plant by Nov. 30 because of poor
margins to make the biofuel.  The mill in Vicksburg, Mississippi, can produce 54 million
gallons of the fuel annually and may be closed until next year,
Jim Temple, a spokesman for Ergon, said in a telephone
interview.  Corn prices have surged 15 percent this year, increasing
the cost of producing the biofuel, as the worst U.S. drought in
56 years baked crops.  Abengoa SA (ABG)  idled its plant in Madison,
Illinois, this month and  Biofuel Energy Corp. (BIOF)  shut its 115
million-gallon-a-year plant in Fairmont,  Minnesota , citing poor
margins on Sept. 24.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery gained 2.1 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $2.406 a gallon at 11 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Futures have gained 9.2 percent this year.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 30 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Ethanol  production  in the U.S. has fallen 17 percent this
year to 801,000 barrels a day in the week ended Oct. 19, Energy
Department data shows.  The Vicksburg distillery is a joint venture between Ergon
Inc. and  Bunge Ltd. (BG)   To contact the reporter on this story:
