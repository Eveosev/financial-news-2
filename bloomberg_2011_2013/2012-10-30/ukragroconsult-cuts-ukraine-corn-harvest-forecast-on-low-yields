Ukraine’s corn harvest forecast was
reduced by 1 percent on low yields after more than half the
country’s corn was harvested, according to researcher
UkrAgroConsult.  The forecast was cut to 18.8 million metric tons from 19
million tons on Oct. 9 after more than 60 percent of the crop
was harvested, the researcher, which is based in the capital
Kiev, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. This is its
second corn forecast reduction this month by UkrAgroConsult.  To contact the reporter on this story:
