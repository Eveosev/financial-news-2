Rory McIlroy is ending his
relationship with Acushnet Co.’s Titleist and FootJoy brands
after the 2012 season, the company and the world’s No. 1-ranked
golfer announced.  Neither McIlroy, who holds the No. 1 spot in the Official
World Golf Ranking over No. 2 Tiger Woods, nor the company
disclosed a reason for the split in a press release.  The Irish Times reported on Oct. 20 that McIlroy, who
captured his second major title with an eight-stroke win at the
PGA Championship in August, could sign a 10-year agreement with
 Nike Inc. (NKE)  worth as much as $250 million. The report didn’t cite
a source for its information.  Conor Ridge, McIlroy’s agent, declined to comment on the
golfer’s equipment sponsorship in an e-mail.  “I have enjoyed five very exciting and successful years
with the company and I will always appreciate the contribution
Titleist has made in helping me become the player I am today,”
McIlroy, 23, said in a statement released by the Fairhaven,
Massachusetts-based company.  McIlroy, who also won the 2011 U.S. Open and defeated Woods
in a head-to-head exhibition match in  China  on Oct. 28, has been
sponsored by Titleist and FootJoy since turning professional in
2007 at age 18.  Beth Gast, a spokeswoman for Nike’s golf division, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
