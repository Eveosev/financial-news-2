Manchester City defender Micah Richards said he expects to be out for up to four months after
surgery on a torn knee cartilage.  Richards, 24, was injured toward the end of the Premier
League champion’s 1-0 home win over Swansea City three days ago.
He was stretchered off wearing an oxygen mask.  “The positive thing is that the injury has been repaired
so the knee will be as good as new,” he told  City’s website .
“I have a brace on it and I am using crutches. I can’t do
anything at all for the next four to six weeks and I am probably
looking at 12-16 weeks before I am back in action.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
