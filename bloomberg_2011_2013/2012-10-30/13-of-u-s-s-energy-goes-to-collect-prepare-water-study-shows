Energy used for treating, heating,
pumping and cooling water in the U.S. accounted for almost 13
percent of the nation’s total annual consumption, according to a
 University of Texas  at Austin study.  The amount, about 12.3 quadrillion BTUs, is equivalent to
the annual energy usage of about 40 million Americans, the study
published in the journal Environmental Research Letters showed.
That makes water one of the largest energy consumers in the
U.S., according to the study’s authors, Kelly Twomey Sanders and
 Michael Webber .  “Energy and water security are achievable and, with
careful planning, we can greatly reduce the amount of water used
to produce energy and the amount of energy used to provide and
use water,” said Webber, associate professor of mechanical
engineering at the university who directed the research project.  About 40 percent of water-related energy in 2010 went to
producing electricity for water-treatment plants, water heaters
and devices such as appliances, which is “about the same amount
of energy consumption for electric lighting in the commercial
and residential sectors,” Twomey Sanders told
environmentalresearchweb. Despite this, more policy attention is
focused on replacing lighting fixtures than “mandating more
efficient water heaters or fixing leaky pipes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
