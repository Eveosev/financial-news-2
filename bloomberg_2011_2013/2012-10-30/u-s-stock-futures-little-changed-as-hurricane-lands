U.S. stock-index  futures  rose as
investors assessed the impact of  Hurricane Sandy  and prepared
for the reopening of equity markets tomorrow.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  expiring in
December added 0.2 percent from Friday’s close, as of 6 p.m.  New
York  time. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 2 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 13,056.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission canceled equity
trading yesterday and today as the 900-mile wide storm caused
flooding and blackouts. The New York Stock Exchange said it
plans to open tomorrow.  The Labor Department is striving to issue its monthly
report on employment in the U.S. in three days as scheduled, a
spokesman said today. The jobs report is the last before the
presidential election, and may help sway voters trying to decide
between giving President  Barack Obama  another four years in
office or to change course with Republican challenger  Mitt
Romney .  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 125,000 workers in October
and the jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent, the report on Nov. 2
will show, according to median forecasts of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  The S&P/Case-Shiller Index of property values in 20 cities
rose 2 percent in August from a year earlier, after a 1.2
percent advance in July, a report showed today. The average
estimate by economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a
1.9 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
