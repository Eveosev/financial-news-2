Canadian  stocks  rose for a fourth
day as  Petrobank Energy & Resources Ltd. (PBG)  posted its biggest gain
since March and factory prices climbed for the first time in
five months. U.S. equity markets were shut for a second day.  Petrobank surged 8.1 percent after the company said its
shareholders will receive the company’s stake in  PetroBakken
Energy Ltd. (PBN)  under a reorganization.  Westport Innovations Inc. (WPT) , a
maker of natural gas engines, plunged 14 percent for its biggest
loss in more than 16 months after yesterday reducing its 2012
revenue outlook to between $340 million and $350 million from
$400 million to $425 million.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  climbed 64.30
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,377.05 in Toronto. Raw materials
companies and banks contributed most to gains on the benchmark
Canadian equity gauge. Eight of 10 industries advanced and
trading was 50 percent lower than the 30-day average at this
time of the day.  “With the U.S. market closed, our market is thin and it
can become very volatile to say the least,” said  Irwin Michael ,
 fund manager  with ABC Funds in Toronto. His firm manages C$1
billion.  The TSX is taking some direction from European markets
which have moved broadly higher, as well as better-than-expected
U.S. housing and Canadian factory price data this morning,
Michael said.  “Any bit of good news is a positive but once you get a
string of palpable positive developments that will help give
people more confidence to spend money,” he said.  Home Prices  Canadian manufacturers’  prices  rose in September for the
first time in five months on metals such as copper and aluminum.  The  S&P/Case-Shiller index  of property values in 20 U.S.
cities rose 2 percent from August 2011, the biggest year-to-year
gain since July 2010, after climbing 1.2 percent the prior
month, the group said today in  New York . The median forecast of
25 economists in a Bloomberg survey projected a 1.9 percent
gain.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest producer of the
metal, added 1.7 percent to C$40.27 and Goldcorp Inc. climbed
1.5 percent to C$45.30. Gold for December delivery rose 0.2
percent to settle at $1,712.10 an ounce in New York, its first
advance in three days.  Petrobank jumped 8.1 percent to C$13.19 after the oil and
gas explorer said it will give shareholders the company’s 57
percent stake in its subsidiary PetroBakken by the end of the
year.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil producer,
increased 0.5 percent to C$33.27 and  Canadian Natural Resources
Ltd. (CNQ)  gained 0.9 percent to C$30.04 as oil rose from a four-month
low. Crude for December delivery climbed 14 cents to settle at
$85.68 a barrel in New York.  Westport Falls  Westport dropped 14 percent to C$24.19, the most since June
2011, after the company said it now expects revenue to grow
about 30 percent this year, in a statement after the market
close yesterday. The company blamed “uncertainty in the economy
and delayed availability of liquefied natural gas
infrastructure” that caused customers to delay ordering.  Vancouver-based Westport also announced today a deal with
Tata Motors to develop engines for light- and medium-duty trucks
and buses. The value of the deal was not disclosed.  Banro Corp. (BAA) , a gold explorer working in the  Democratic
Republic  of Congo in  Africa , slumped 5.8 percent to C$4.35,
paring earlier losses of as much as 13 percent.  A report obtained by the country’s business association
investigating an update to Congo’s 10-year-old mining code said
the country may increase state participation in mining projects
to 35 percent from 5 percent and raise royalties on minerals
exports.  A spokeswoman with Banro said in an interview with
Bloomberg the company was not subject to the possible changes to
the Congo mining code as it has a “mining convention” in the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
