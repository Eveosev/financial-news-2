South Africa ’s first census in a
decade shows wealth disparities between race groups that persist
18 years after the end of apartheid.  While incomes for black households increased an average 169
percent over 10 years, their annual earnings are 60,613
rand ($6,987), or a sixth of that for whites, Statistics South
Africa said in a report released in  Cape Town  today. About 80
percent of South Africa’s 51.8 million population is black.  “These figures tell us that at the bottom of the rung is
the black majority who continue to be confronted by deep
poverty, unemployment and inequality,” President  Jacob Zuma 
said at the release of the results. “Great strides have been
made. However, much remains to be done to further improve the
livelihoods of our people especially in terms of significant
disparities that still exist between the rich and poor.”  Under white segregationist rule, black South Africans were
disadvantaged by poor education that confined many to unskilled,
low-paying jobs. Zuma’s  African National Congress  has struggled
to rectify the inequality gap since coming to power in 1994 even
as it boosted access to electricity and water.  South Africa’s population increased 16 percent since the
last census was conducted in 2001 and compares with 50.6 million
estimated in mid-2011, the statistics agency said. About 9
percent of the population is of mixed race, 8.9 percent white
and 2.5 percent Asian, it said.  Incomes for white households increased 88 percent to
365,134 rand in the past decade, the data shows.  AIDS Orphans  Population growth and life expectancy have been curbed by
one of the world’s worst AIDS epidemics. About one in nine
people in  South Africa  are infected with HIV, the virus that
causes the disease, according to the government. The census
found 3.37 million children under the age of 17, or 19 percent
of the total, had lost one or both parents, with AIDS cited as a
major contributor.  Sixty-six percent of the population are between 15 and 64
years old, and 29 percent are younger than 15.  Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and  Pretoria ,
has a population of 12.3 million people, overtaking eastern
KwaZulu-Natal province, where 10.3 million people live, as the
most populous province.  South Africa has 14.45 million households, 78 percent of
which are formal dwellings, the census shows. About 85 percent
of households have electric lighting, up from 51 percent in
2001, while 91 percent have access to piped water, up from 85
percent. Just 35 percent of households have  Internet access .  To contact the reporter on this story:
