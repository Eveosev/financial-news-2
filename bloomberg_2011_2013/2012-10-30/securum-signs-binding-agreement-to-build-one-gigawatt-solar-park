Securum Equity Partners &
Associates , a venture management company, said it signed a
definitive agreement with  Serbia  on building the “largest solar
park in the world” in the Balkan country.  The one-gigawatt park will cost 1.28 billion euros ($1.66
billion) to build and enable production of 1.14 terawatt hours a
year from panels provided by MX Group Southeast  Europe  with
technology from Italy’s  MX Group SpA , the company said in an e-
mailed statement today. Electricity will be exported “mainly to
the markets in western Europe that need green energy,” said
Ivan Matejak, Securum’s manager for Serbia, in a phone
interview.  The so-called OneGiga  project  will occupy 3,000 hectares in
southern Serbia, “in the vicinity of  power lines ,” Matejak
said, without specifying a location, pending an agreement for a
long-term land lease. Construction work is to begin in April and
the park should be completed by the end of 2015, he said.  Developing the park will create 800 jobs, while 120 will be
employed for maintenance once production begins. Serbia’s
government said in May it would provide land free of charge for
the project.  Securum estimated the maintenance cost at 475 million euros
over the park’s expected service life of 25 years.  Italy ’s Fimer
SpA is providing technology for inverters, the devices that
convert the power from photovoltaic panels for use in the grid.  The binding agreement with Serbia’s government was signed
on Oct. 25, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
