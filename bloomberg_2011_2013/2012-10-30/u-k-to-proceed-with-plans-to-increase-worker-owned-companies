The U.K. government said it will
press on with plans to stimulate employee ownership of companies
as it seeks to create a more sustainable economic model in the
wake of the financial crisis.  Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  and Cabinet Secretary
Francis Maude welcomed recommendations by government-appointed
adviser  Graeme Nuttall , a partner at London law firm Field
Fisher Waterhouse, to create a government-led working group to
foster worker ownership. They also backed the creation of an
independent body to support companies in transition to a new
ownership model and the creation of legal templates for
companies to speed up the process.  “Businesses that are owned by their employees produce
more, grow faster, keep their workforce happier and pay staff
more fairly,” Clegg said in an e-mailed statement in London
today. “Our economy suffered a massive heart attack –- now we
have to build our strength back up.”  The government will consult on changes to amend company law
until Nov. 16 and on plans to give workers the right to request
ownership. The U.K. has about 250 worker-owned companies with
sales of about 30 billion pounds ($48 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
