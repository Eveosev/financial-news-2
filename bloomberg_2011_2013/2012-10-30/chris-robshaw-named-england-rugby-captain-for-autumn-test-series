Chris Robshaw was named captain for
the England rugby team’s autumn international series, the Rugby
Football Union said in a statement.  The Harlequins flanker has captained England in seven of
the eight Tests played under coach  Stuart Lancaster , including
this year’s Six Nations championship and the tour of South
Africa.  “It’s a real honor to be asked again,” Robshaw, 26, said
in the RFU statement. “We are lucky to have some good leaders
in the squad who I know I can work well with and count on their
support.”  England opens its autumn Test series by hosting Fiji on
Nov. 10, followed by games against Australia (Nov. 17), South
Africa (Nov. 24) and world champion New Zealand (Dec. 1).  To contact the reporter on this story:
