China’s  yuan  gained, approaching a
19-year high, after the Bank of Japan announced fresh stimulus
and on speculation its trading band may be widened.  Most Asian currencies rose after the BOJ said today it
would expand its asset-purchase program for the second time in
two months. The People’s Bank of China may widen the yuan’s
trading limit from 1 percent to 2.5 percent after the U.S.
presidential election and the 18th Communist Party Congress next
month, the China Daily reported today, citing Lu Zhengwei, chief
economist at Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai.  “The yuan has followed the rebound in Asian currencies
after the BOJ decision,” said Patrick Cheng, a foreign exchange
analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong Kong.
The trading band report also supported the currency, he said.  The yuan gained 0.05 percent to close at 6.2405 per dollar
in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. It touched 6.2398 earlier, close to yesterday’s high of
6.2371 that was the strongest level since the government unified
the official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s  reference rate 
0.06 percent weaker at 6.3028 per dollar today, the first
reduction in four days. One-month implied volatility for the
onshore yuan, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
1.65 percent.  The currency has advanced 0.7 percent in October, and is
headed for a third straight monthly gain. The rapid appreciation
isn’t sustainable and poses a threat to the financial system,
according to a front-page commentary in today’s  China  Securities
Journal newspaper.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.03 percent
to 6.2450 versus the greenback, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.03
percent to 6.3555, a 1.8 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
