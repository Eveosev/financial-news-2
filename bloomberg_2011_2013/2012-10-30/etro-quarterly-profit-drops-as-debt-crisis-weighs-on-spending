Metro AG,  Germany ’s biggest
retailer, reported a decline in third-quarter earnings as
 Europe ’s debt crisis weighed on  consumer spending  and the
retailer realized less income from real estate assets.  Earnings before interest and taxes before special items
fell 35 percent to 398 million euros ($513 million), the
Dusseldorf-based company said today in a statement. That missed
the 415.3 million-euro  average estimate  of 14 analysts compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Metro Group’s earnings in particular reflect the impact
of the general economic situation in southern Europe and parts
of eastern Europe” Metro said in a statement today. “Roughly
half of the decline in earnings is attributable to significantly
lower income from real estate divestments.”  The retailer lowered its 2012 Ebit forecast to about 2
billion euros on Oct. 5, saying that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis is weighing on sales in the south and east of the region.
Metro said at the time that consumer electronics are
particularly affected by a worsening economic environment.  Metro reported  net income  of 77 million euros compared to
190 million euros in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 0.6
percent to 15.9 billion euros. That was in line with the 15.87
billion-euro average estimate of 16 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 2 percent adjusted for the disposal of
Makro UK, the company said.  Metro AG (MEO)  agreed to sell its Makro U.K. wholesale unit to
 Booker Group Plc (BOK)  for 139.7 million pounds in cash and shares in
May to concentrate on its main businesses.  The shares have slumped 24 percent this year, and the stock
left Germany’s benchmark DAX index last month. Metro fell 2.9
percent to 21.43 euros yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
