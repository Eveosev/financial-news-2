Corn rose, snapping the longest
losing streak since March 2011, on signs that a slump in prices
may have boosted demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s
largest grower. Soybeans also gained.  The amount of corn  inspected  for export at U.S. ports
increased 49 percent in the week ended Oct. 25, compared with a
week earlier, to 15.5 million bushels, the Department of
Agriculture said yesterday. The grain slid 3.1 percent last week
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, and is down 13 percent since
concerns about U.S. drought sent prices to a record $8.49 a
bushel in August.  The U.S. had “quite an impressive inspections result” for
corn, Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said
by phone from  Singapore  today. “It’s one of the factors that
will support prices.”  Corn for December delivery advanced 0.5 percent to $7.4075
a bushel by 7:54 a.m. in Chicago, after falling for six straight
days. Soybeans for January gained 0.4 percent to $15.365 a
bushel, after losing 2.7 percent in the past three days.  A rebound in corn production in  South America , following
dry weather in the past season, may send prices lower in the
next 12 months, analysts led by Tobias Merath said today in an
e-mailed Credit Suisse AG private banking report.  Brazil ’s
growing areas will receive rain this week, benefiting planting,
weather consultant Somar Meteorologia said in an e-mailed report
yesterday.  Wheat for December delivery gained 0.7 percent to $8.64 a
bushel in Chicago, the first advance in four days. In Paris,
January-delivery milling wheat rose 0.3 percent to 265 euros
($343) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
