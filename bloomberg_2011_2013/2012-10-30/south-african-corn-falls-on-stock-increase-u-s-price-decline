South African white corn fell for a
fourth day on speculation there is sufficient local supply of
the grain and after the price in the U.S. had the longest losing
streak since March 2011.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, decreased 0.3 percent to 2,472 rand ($285) a metric
ton by the close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg, the lowest closing level since Oct. 17. The yellow
variety declined 0.5 percent to 2,530 rand a ton.  Corn stocks in  South Africa , the continent’s biggest
producer, rose 9.3 percent in September from a year earlier, the
nation’s grain information service said on Oct. 24. Prices slid
3.1 percent last week on the Chicago Board of Trade and are down
13 percent since concern about drought in the U.S. sent the
grain to a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10. An increase in corn
output in  South America , following dry weather in the past
season, may reduce prices in the next 12 months, Credit Suisse
AG analysts said in a report today.  “There is abundant supply of corn at the silos,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes
Ltd., said by phone. “Our market is not anxious about the
supply of maize, not unless they export a lot of white corn.”  Corn gained 0.8 percent on the Chicago Board of Trade today
on signs that a slump in prices may have boosted demand for
supplies from the U.S., the world’s largest grower.  South African wheat for delivery in December fell 0.4
percent to 3,613 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
