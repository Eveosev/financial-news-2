Serbia, which is restructuring
state-owned drugmaker Galenika AD and may offer a stake to the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  The Zemun, Serbia-based  company , whose 2011 loss widened to
20 million euros ($26 million), may return to profitability this
year or next after the “restructuring that is both financial
and operational,” and includes efforts to collect 90 million
euros owed by drug wholesalers Velefarm AD and  BG Farm , General
Manager Zivomir Novakovic said in a phone interview today.  A minority stake may be offered to the London-based EBRD or
another international financial organization after the overhaul
as the government will probably want to keep a controlling stake
in the company, Novakovic said.  The government said last week it will no longer back
liquidity loans for its unprofitable companies. Earlier this
year, Galenika received guarantees to borrow 70 million euros
($91 million) to service debt and pay suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
