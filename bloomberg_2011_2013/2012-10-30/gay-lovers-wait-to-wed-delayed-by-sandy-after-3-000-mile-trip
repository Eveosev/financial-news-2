For Gabrielle Mecham and Ashley
Saverino,  Hurricane Sandy  meant the delay of a wedding that was
impossible in their home state.  The women had planned to be married in New York’s Central
Park after flying from California, where voters had halted
court-sanctioned gay unions. Saverino’s sister was even
ordained, which would allow her to preside over the ceremony.
The storm meant they were unable to get the required paperwork
in New York.  “We traveled 3,000 miles just to participate in that type
of matrimony and it’s just been kind of deflected,” Mecham, 27,
said today. “We’re hoping that the courthouse will open up
tomorrow,” the day they’re scheduled to return.  The couple said they underestimated the strength of the
storm, which they knew about before leaving  San Diego . Sandy
flooded tunnels of the  subway system , shut government offices
and left more than 750,000 customers in New York without power.  “We thought everything would be settled by Monday but it
just got worse and worse,” said Mecham, a student at  San Diego
State University , while standing outside a Duane Reade store in
Manhattan where Saverino was buying socks.  “My feet are soaked through,” Saverino, 28, a massage
therapist, said. “When you’re from California you don’t have
really good footwear.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
