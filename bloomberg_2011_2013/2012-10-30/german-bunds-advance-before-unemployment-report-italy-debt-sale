Italian government bonds rose, with
10-year yields falling from the highest level in two weeks, as
the country met its maximum target as it sold 7 billion euros
($9.1 billion) of five- and 10-year debt.  Italy ’s five-year notes gained for the first time in more
than a week after borrowing costs fell at the auction. Spanish
10-year bonds fell as the country’s recession deepened in the
third quarter and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said yesterday he
would request external aid only when he judges it’s in the
nation’s interests. German 10-year bunds declined as a report
showed unemployment increased.  “Overall the auction went well,” said Gianluca Ziglio, a
strategist at UBS AG in London. “It is a decent auction and so
Italian yields are lower. Spain remains in limbo. It is evident
that they are not going to ask for aid any time soon.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5 percent at 4:30 p.m. London time after
rising to 5.02 percent yesterday, the  highest  since Oct. 12, The
5.5 percent bond due in November 2022 rose 0.14, or 1.40 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 104.40. The five-year yield
dropped seven basis points to 3.82 percent.  Italy sold bonds maturing in November 2022 at an average
yield of 4.92 percent, compared with 5.24 percent at the
previous sale on Sept. 27. Five-year notes due in November 2017
were auctioned at an  average yield  of 3.80 percent, down from
4.06 percent on Oct. 11.  Spanish Economy  Spain’s  gross domestic product  declined 0.3 percent in the
three months through September, compared with 0.4 percent the
prior quarter, the Madrid-based National Statistics Institute
said. That compared with the Bank of Spain’s estimate on Oct. 23
of a 0.4 percent contraction.  Spanish 10-year bonds dropped for a second day, with the
yield rising one basis point to 5.67 percent.  The extra yield, or  spread , that investors demand to hold
Spanish 10-year bonds instead of their Italian counterparts
widened three basis points to 67 basis points. The Spanish
securities yielded less than their Italian counterparts as
recently as March.  “Italy looks relatively safer than Spain,” Andrew Balls,
London-based head of European portfolio management at Pacific
Investment Management Co., which runs the world’s biggest bond
fund, said on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with  Francine Lacqua . “There’s a lot of political risk in Italy but much less
of an adjustment risk. Spain has got to try and do a big fiscal
adjustment.”  German Unemployment  The number of Germans out of work rose a seasonally
adjusted 20,000 from September to 2.94 million, the Federal
Labor Agency said in Nuremberg. Economists forecast an increase
of 10,000, the median of 31 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey 
showed. The  adjusted jobless rate  was 6.9 percent in October,
matching the revised reading in September, which was the first
gain in more than three years.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose two basis points to 1.48
percent after falling to 1.44 percent, the least since Oct. 4.  Volatility on  Finland ’s bonds was the highest among euro-
area markets today, followed by those of the Netherlands and
 Austria , according to measures of 10-year debt, the spread
between two-and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  The Finnish 10-year yield increased three basis points to
1.72 percent.  Dutch Bonds  Dutch 10-year bonds fell for the first time in three days
after the Liberal and Labor parties reached an agreement
yesterday to form a government and cut the budget by about 16
billion euros in the next four years.  The 10-year yield climbed two basis points to 1.74 percent.
It has dropped 14 basis points since the Sept. 12 elections.  “This package will affect everyone,” caretaker Prime
Minister Mark Rutte told journalists in the Hague yesterday as
he announced the deal. “Economic growth is on a structurally
lower level in the Netherlands and we can’t pass on the bill to
future generations.”  German bonds returned 3.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities gained 2.6 percent, while Italy’s rose 16 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
