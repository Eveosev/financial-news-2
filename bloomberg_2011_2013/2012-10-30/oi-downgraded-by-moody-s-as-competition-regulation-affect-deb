Oi SA (OIBR4) ’s credit rating was lowered by
Moody’s Investors Service, which said intensifying competition
and regulatory pressure will delay attempts by Brazil’s largest
phone company to reduce debt.  Moody’s reduced Oi one level to Baa3, the lowest
investment-grade rating, according to a statement yesterday.
 Standard & Poor’s  has had a similar rating of BBB- on Rio de
Janeiro-based Oi since at least September 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brazil’s market is so competitive that any savings Oi gets
from lower operating costs must immediately be passed on to
consumers, Moody’s said. The government is pushing carriers to
invest more to improve service and expand their networks,
sapping  cash flow , the ratings company said.  “Oi’s ability to deleverage significantly in the near term
will be limited,” Nymia Almeida, a Moody’s analyst, said in the
statement.  Oi fell 2.5 percent to 8.14 reais at the close in  Sao
Paulo . The shares have dropped 25 percent this year.  The company’s board approved a plan Oct. 24 to open a
credit line of 5.4 billion reais ($2.7 billion) with state
development bank BNDES to finance its network investments
through 2014, according to a filing yesterday in Brazil.  Oi’s press office declined to comment on the downgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
