Asian currencies strengthened, led
by South Korea’s won, after the  Bank of Japan  announced
additional stimulus and U.S. consumer spending topped estimates.  The BOJ increased its asset-purchase program today by 11
trillion yen ($138 billion) to 66 trillion yen, hours after a
report showed the biggest decline in industrial output since
last year’s earthquake. U.S. personal spending rose by the most
since February, official data showed yesterday. Chinese
manufacturing expanded for the first time in three months in
October, according to a Bloomberg survey before a report due Nov.
1.  “Aggressive global easing plus improving data from the U.S.
and China adds up to a strong outlook for Asian currencies,”
 Nizam Idris , head of Asian fixed income and foreign-exchange at
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore, wrote in an e-mailed response
to questions. “We could get confirmation on Thursday that the
Chinese economy is gradually recovering.”  The won appreciated 0.4 percent to 1,091.50 per dollar at
the close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Malaysia’s ringgit advanced 0.3 percent to 3.0517, while
Taiwan’s dollar and the  Philippine peso  gained 0.1 percent to
NT$29.278 and 41.213, respectively.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, rose 0.2
percent and touched 117.84, near the 117.93 level reached on Oct.
25 that was the highest since February.  Korean Surplus  U.S. Household purchases rose 0.8 percent in September from
a year earlier, beating the 0.6 percent forecast in a Bloomberg
survey and a 0.5 percent increase in August. A survey of
economists by  Bloomberg News  showed China’s  Purchasing Managers ’
Index may rise to 50.2 this month, the highest since June.  The won strengthened to a 13-month high as data showed the
nation’s current-account surplus widened to near a record. The
 excess  was $6.07 billion last month, just shy of the $6.14
billion in July. The central bank said today it will conduct a
review of banks’ currency-forward positions next month, which
may lead to regulation.  “There were some investors taking long positions on the
dollar after the central bank’s forward-position review
report,” said Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency dealer at
Daegu Bank. “Exporters selling the greenback supported the won
and triggered investors to cut their long positions.” A long
position is a bet an asset will rise in value.  Yuan Rallies  The ringgit reversed an earlier decline after the BOJ
announcement, which followed the  Federal Reserve ’s decision in
September to buy $40 billion of mortgage debt per month.  “It adds further stimulus into the whole global system and
the immediate reaction is riskier currencies will get a further
boost,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange
research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore.  China’s  yuan  advanced 0.05 percent to 6.2405 even as the
People’s Bank of China set the currency’s daily fixing 0.06
percent weaker, the first reduction in four days. The yuan has
rallied 2 percent since the end of July. The rapid appreciation
isn’t sustainable and poses a hidden threat to the financial
system, according to a front-page China Securities Journal
commentary today.  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht strengthened 0.1 percent to
30.71 per dollar, India’s rupee was little changed at 54.0550
and Indonesia’s rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,618. The
Vietnamese dong was steady at 20,848.  To contact the reporter on this story:
