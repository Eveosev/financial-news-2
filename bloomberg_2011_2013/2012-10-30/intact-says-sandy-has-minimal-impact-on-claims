Intact Financial Corp. (IFC) , Canada’s
largest property and casualty insurer, said it’s had “minimal”
claims from damage related to superstorm Sandy.  “The impact has been quite minimal,” Gilles Gratton, a
spokesman, said today in an interview.  “We have had a higher
volume of calls.”  Parts of Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces were
buffeted with high winds and rains from  Hurricane Sandy , which
hit southern New Jersey yesterday at about 8 p.m.  New York  time.  Intact, based in Toronto, would have exposure through its
insurance business if the storm caused damage in Canada, RBC
Capital Markets analyst Andre-Philippe Hardy said yesterday in a
note. As many as 150,000 customers in Ontario were without power
today after heavy winds and rains knocked out lines.  Bank of Montreal (BMO) , which has a reinsurance business, also
said the storm has had little impact on Canada’s fourth-biggest
bank.  “Based on current estimates of insured industry claims
related to Hurricane Sandy, we expect that any impact on BMO
would be nominal,” said Paul Deegan, a spokesman for the
Toronto-based bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
