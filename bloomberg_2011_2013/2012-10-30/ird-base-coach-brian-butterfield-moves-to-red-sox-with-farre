New  Boston Red Sox  manager John
Farrell has hired Brian Butterfield from his Toronto Blue Jays
staff to coach third base, the Red Sox said in a news release.  Butterfield, 54, who previously coached with the  New York 
Yankees and  Arizona  Diamondbacks, spent the past 11 of his 34
seasons as a player, coach and manager with the  Blue Jays . He
was Toronto’s third-base coach the past three seasons, two of
them under Farrell.  Butterfield, a second baseman who was signed by the Yankees
in 1979, spent five seasons as a player in the minor leagues and
never made a Major League Baseball team roster.  He then got into coaching and later managed parts of six
minor-league seasons in the Yankees’ system, compiling a 300-293
mark.  He is the son of the late Jack Butterfield, who worked as
the Yankees’ vice president of player development and scouting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
