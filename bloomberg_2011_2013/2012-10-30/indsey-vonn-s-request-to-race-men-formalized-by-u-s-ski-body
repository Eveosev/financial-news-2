The U.S. Ski and Snowboard
Association said it has sent a letter to the International Ski
Federation, asking the governing body to consider a request by
U.S. skier  Lindsey Vonn  to race against men.  Olympic downhill champion Vonn had approached the FIS in
early October with her request to race compete in a men’s World
Cup downhill on Nov. 24 in Lake Louise,  Alberta .  Bill Marolt, president and chief executive of the U.S. Ski
and Snowboard Association (USSA) has written to FIS president
Gian Franco Kasper, asking for Vonn’s request to be considered
by the FIS Council which is scheduled to meet in Switzerland on
Nov. 3, USSA said in a statement on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
