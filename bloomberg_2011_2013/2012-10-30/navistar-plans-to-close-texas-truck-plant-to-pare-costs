Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the
truckmaker trying to end losses, said it plans to close a Texas
factory next year.  Navistar said the the shutdown will reduce operating costs
by $25 million to $35 million annually. The Garland, Texas,
factory employs about 900 people, the Lisle, Illinois-based
company said in a statement.  Navistar’S four largest investors hold about 50 percent of
the shares, including a  14.95 percent  stake held by  Carl Icahn .
Navistar averted a proxy fight this month with Icahn by agreeing
to accept three new directors.  The company said production at the Texas plant will be
shifted to other North American factories building similar
models starting in January. The Garland plant will close in the
first half of next year. Navistar also said it expects to record
pretax costs of no more than $10 million for benefits to
employees who lose their jobs and other costs in fiscal 2013 of
$30 million to $50 million.  The company’s shares have tumbled 51 percent this year to
$18.51 through Oct. 26, the last day before  Hurricane Sandy 
caused New York trading to be suspended.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
