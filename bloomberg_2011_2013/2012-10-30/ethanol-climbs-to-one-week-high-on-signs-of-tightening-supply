Ethanol futures in  Chicago  climbed
to the highest price in a week on speculation that plant
shutdowns will help soak up a supply glut.  Prices jumped for a third day after producers including
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , Bunge-Ergon Vicksburg LLC,  Abengoa SA (ABG)  and
 Biofuel Energy Corp. (BIOF)  idled output starting in late September,
citing poor margins to manufacture the fuel from corn. Ethanol
 stockpiles , which totaled 18.8 million barrels in the week ended
Oct. 19, were 8.5 percent higher than a year ago, Energy
Department data showed.  “My feeling is that stocks would be lower,” said  Ian
Jackson , an ethanol trader at SCB & Associates in Chicago.
“Certainly, you’ve seen some tightness in the physical
market.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 2.8 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.413 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since Oct. 22. Futures have gained 9.5 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in New York
at $2.47 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf at $2.46, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol on the West Coast plunged 7 cents, or 2.8 percent,
to $2.46 a gallon and in Chicago the additive increased 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.395.  Corn Prices  Corn for December delivery gained 4.75 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $7.4175 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 30 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Gasoline for November delivery decreased 2.8 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.7288 a gallon in  New York . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s  discount  to the motor fuel narrowed to 31.58
cents from 37.18 cents yesterday. Gasoline traded at a premium
of 99.8 cents to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
