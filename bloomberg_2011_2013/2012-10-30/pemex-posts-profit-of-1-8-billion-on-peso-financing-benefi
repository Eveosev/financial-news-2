Petroleos Mexicanos posted its first
quarterly profit since March after the world’s fourth-largest
crude producer benefited from accounting adjustments on its
financing costs.  Third-quarter net income was 23.9 billion pesos ($1.83
billion), compared to a loss of 81.5 billion pesos a year
earlier, the Mexico City-based company known as Pemex said
yesterday in a stock exchange filing. The state-owned producer’s
revenue rose 4.3 percent to 409 billion pesos, from 392 billion
pesos the previous year. Operating income increased 10 percent
to 221 billion pesos.  Pemex registered a third-quarter “comprehensive
financing” income of 94.3 billion pesos, the state-owned
producer said. The benefit was caused after the peso
strengthened about 4 percent and interest income rose, the
company said.  The oil producer also profited from higher sales after the
company posted its highest crude production in 17 months as the
Tsimin field came online and unleaded gasoline prices rose 12
percent compared to a year ago.  Chief Executive Officer  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  is counting
on production from new wells to drive Pemex to its first annual
output gain in eight years. The company said it will boost
production this year to more than 2.6 million barrels a day.
While output rose in September to 2.566 million barrels a day,
the daily average for the quarter was little changed at 2.541
million barrels, compared to 2.525 million barrels a day in the
year earlier period.  Taxes and royalties to the government rose 5 percent to 223
billion pesos, Pemex said. Total debt rose to 744 billion pesos
as of Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
