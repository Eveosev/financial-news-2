Australian sales of newly built
homes declined for a third straight month in September,
underscoring the central bank’s decision to resume lowering
 interest rates .  Sales decreased 3.7 percent to 5,186 from August, when they
dropped 5.3 percent, the Canberra-based Housing Industry
Association said, citing a survey of the nation’s largest
builders. Detached house sales fell 3.5 percent, while
apartments were down 4.2 percent, it showed.  “Interest-rate cuts should help foster a recovery in new
home sales” in the final quarter, said  Harley Dale , HIA chief
economist. “The  Reserve Bank  of Australia needs to play its
part by cutting rates again next Tuesday -- a renewed easing of
rates in October that is not followed up could add to household
uncertainty and, perversely, further damage confidence.”  The RBA reduced its overnight cash-rate target by a quarter
percentage point to 3.25 percent this month, ending a three-
meeting pause, as it seeks to revive industries outside a
resource boom. Traders are pricing in a 64 percent chance the
central bank will cut by a quarter percentage point to 3 percent
