  Shanghai Aerospace Automobile
Electromechanical Co. (600151) , a maker of car air conditioners and
solar-power parts, secured approval from the Gansu Provincial
Development and Reform Commission to develop solar farms in the
northwestern Chinese province.  Its unit Gansu Zhangye Shenzhou Photovoltaic Power Co. will
build the two plants, each with a capacity of 9 megawatts at
Zhangye city in Gansu, Shanghai Aerospace said today in a  filing 
to the Shanghai stock exchange. The cost of the projects and
other financial information weren’t disclosed.  The Shanghai-based company said in August it secured
approval to develop an additional three projects totaling 27
megawatts in Gansu’s Jiayuguan city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
