 About 100 people stormed the
chamber of  Libya ’s parliament, the National Congress, today in a
protest against the proposed new government cabinet members,
state television reported.  Live television coverage went off the air shortly after the
protesters appeared in the chamber during an evening session.  The 200-strong congress had been debating whether to
approve a 32-member cabinet proposed earlier in the day by Prime
Minister-elect Ali Zidan.  After the session was interrupted, the protesters were
persuaded to leave and there were no casualties, state
television reported.   Parliament Speaker Mohammed Magariaf declared the session
closed for the day “because with this psychological situation
we cannot continue.”  It is the third time that the national congress, housed in a
Tripoli conference center, has been attacked by protesters this
month.   On Oct. 22, 500 protesters from the town of Bani Walid, 90
miles southeast of Tripoli, objecting to a national army attack
on their town, entered the grounds and broke the glass on the
front entrance.  On Oct. 6, about 100 people from the town of Zawiya, 40
miles west of Tripoli, occupied part of the building objecting
to the lack of anyone from their town being on the proposed
cabinet list, later rejected, of then-Prime Minister-elect
Mustafa Abushagur.  To contact the reporters on this story:
