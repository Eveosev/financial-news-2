TNK-BP, the Russian oil venture OAO
Rosneft plans to acquire, said profit rose 53 percent as it
benefited from a lag in export duties and the ruble’s strength.  Net income grew to $2.73 billion from $1.79 billion a year
earlier, TNK-BP International Ltd. said today in a statement.  “Export duties and taxes other than income tax decreased
by 10 percent quarter-on-quarter primarily due to a comparative
positive effect of duty lag,” according to TNK-BP’s statement.
Foreign exchange gains also boosted profit, the company said.  TNK-BP is benefiting from a cut in export duties in October
last year as Russian leader Vladimir Putin, then prime minister,
seeks to maintain output at more than 10 million barrels a day
for at least a decade. The 50-50 venture is the first of
 Russia ’s oil and gas companies to publish third-quarter
financial results to international standards.  State-run Rosneft, the country’s largest producer, said
last week it plans to buy the 50-50 venture from  BP Plc (BP/)  and its
billionaire partners for almost $55 billion.  Revenue gained 2.8 percent from a year earlier to $15.7
billion, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization climbed $4.31 billion from $3.46 billion, according
to the statement. Oil and gas output advanced 0.4 percent to
2.003 million barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
