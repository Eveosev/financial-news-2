One Bank of Korea board member
opposed the decision to cut  interest rates  for the second time
this year in October, while another stressed the economy is
expected to recover next year, a report today showed.  The BOK reduced the benchmark rate on Oct. 11 to 2.75
percent from 3 percent. Lim Seung Tae was the only dissenter in
the meeting, according to the minutes released today on the
central bank’s  website .  “Korea may see an extended period of low growth and then
we should review how far the rate should be cut,” said Lim, who
called for no change, according to the report. “In case
economic conditions may deteriorate further, we’d better
preserve monetary policy room now.”  One board member, whose name was not identified, said in
the report that the central bank needs to “study” the effects
of this year’s easing.  South Korea ’s economy is expected to
recover next year along with the global economy, the member
said.  Another board member called for new policy measures to
prevent excessive capital inflows from global monetary easing,
while another said in the minutes that efforts in emerging
countries to make their currencies more competitive may harm
South Korea’s economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
