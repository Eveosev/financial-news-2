Jason Atherton, the chef who won a
Michelin star within months of opening Pollen Street Social in
Mayfair, plans to open a bistro and bar in  London ’s Soho.  The new venue on Poland Street, called the Social Eating
House, will seat 60 to 65 diners, with space for as many as 70
in the upstairs bar. There will also be 10-12 seats in the
kitchen, with a range of tasting menus. The opening is scheduled
for March next year.  “We want to create a beautiful space where people can have
a good meal that is good value, especially in a recession,”
Atherton said in an interview. Starters will be priced between
six pounds ($9.64) and eight pounds, and mains 12-18 pounds.  The venue will be run and part-owned by Paul Hood, the head
chef at Pollen Street Social. Hood worked at Maze with Atherton,
who created that restaurant for  Gordon Ramsay . The venture will
be backed by Atherton and his business partner, Mavis Oei.  Atherton, 41, and Oei have previously opened establishments
in  Shanghai ,  Hong Kong  and  Singapore .  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
