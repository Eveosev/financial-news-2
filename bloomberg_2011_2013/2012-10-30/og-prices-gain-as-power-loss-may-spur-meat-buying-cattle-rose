Hog futures climbed on speculation
that electricity losses from  Hurricane Sandy  will prompt U.S.
consumers in the Northeast to increase meat purchases in the
coming weeks to replace spoiled food. Cattle also rose.  The Atlantic superstorm came ashore in southern  New Jersey 
at 8 p.m. local time yesterday and drove floodwaters to life-
threatening levels in a region with 60 million residents. At
least 3.6 million homes and businesses were without power
yesterday, the government said.  “Without power out there, those people are going to have
to restock their freezers here in the next few weeks,” Lou Arens, a broker at PCI Advisory Services, said in a telephone
interview from Waucoma,  Iowa . “That may boost product value
over the next few days.”  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.4 percent to
settle at 78.1 cents a pound at 3 p.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange. The commodity is down 7.4 percent this year.  Wholesale  pork  increased 0.1 percent to 85.26 cents a pound
yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Meatpackers
processed 845,000 hogs in the first two days of this week, down
2.8 percent from a week earlier, government data show.  Cattle futures for December delivery gained 0.7 percent to
settle at $1.262 a pound in Chicago. Prices are up 3.9 percent
this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 1.4
percent to $1.495 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
