UniCredit SpA (UCG)  recommended that
companies in the European Union emissions-trading system swap EU
allowances into international  carbon offsets  after the spread
between those two widened to a record.  The cost of pollution in the European cap-and-trade system
is likely to fall and the difference in price between EU
emission permits and United Nations offsets is likely to narrow
again, UniCredit analysts wrote in a research note yesterday. UN
Certified Emission Reduction credits and Emission Reduction
Units can be used by companies in the EU market for compliance
with their pollution quotas.  “We therefore recommend participants in the EU Emissions
Trading System to realize swapping activities now within their
allowed quota,” the bank’s research team said. “However, it is
important for installation operators to ensure that the received
CERs/ERUs are eligible for compliance.”  The European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, proposed
earlier this month in a draft regulation that ERUs from
countries without new emission-reduction targets in place until
2020, and whose greenhouse-gas cutting projects are approved by
UN regulators, would be allowed for use in the EU as long as
they were issued before the end of April 2013, and covered
emissions reductions achieved before the end of 2012, according
to two people with knowledge of the matter.  CERs, generated under another UN mechanism, are not subject
to any restrictions under the commission’s proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
