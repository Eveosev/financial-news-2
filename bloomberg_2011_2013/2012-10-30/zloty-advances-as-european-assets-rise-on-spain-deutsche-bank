The zloty advanced after stronger
earnings results from Deutsche Bank AG and a Spanish report
showing the economy shrank less than forecast boosted demand for
European assets.  The zloty appreciated 0.5 percent to 4.1286 per euro as of
5:38 p.m. in Warsaw, the strongest gain among more than 20
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Yields on five-
year Polish notes rose one basis point to 4.13 percent.  Deutsche Bank,  Germany ’s largest lender, said profit
unexpectedly rose as investment-banking revenue exceeded
targets. Italian borrowing costs dropped at an auction of five
and 10-year debt today while the Spanish economy shrank 0.3
percent in three months to September, compared with the Bank of
 Spain ’s estimate of a 0.4 percent contraction. The euro area is
Poland’s largest export market.  “Slightly better data on Spanish GDP have improved the
sentiment a bit,” Joanna Bachert, an analyst at PKO Bank Polski
SA, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  The zloty weakened 0.4 percent yesterday after Andrzej
Raczko, a member of the central bank’s management board, said
short-term depreciation of the currency was “desirable” as it
would help boost  Poland ’s exports. It has gained 8.1 percent
this year, the third-best among emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg after the Hungarian forint and Chilean
peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
