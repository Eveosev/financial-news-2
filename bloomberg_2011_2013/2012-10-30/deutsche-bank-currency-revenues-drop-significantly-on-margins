Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  UBS AG (UBSN) , the
first- and fourth-placed currency dealers as ranked by Euromoney
Institutional Investor Plc, said foreign-exchange income fell in
the third quarter from a year earlier.  “Foreign-exchange revenues were significantly lower than
the prior-year quarter, due to compressed margins,” Deutsche
Bank said in an earnings report released today. Revenues from
rates trading were “significantly higher” on “strong client
activity, particularly in Europe, and less volatile markets,”
the Frankfurt-based company said.  Money-market revenues were “significantly lower” as
volatility declined, Deutsche Bank said.  UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank, said in its earnings
report also released today that foreign-exchange revenue
declined due to lower volumes and reduced volatility.  Fixed income, currencies and commodities revenues were
broadly unchanged, as a credit-market rally was offset by
subdued foreign-exchange and interest-rate markets, the Zurich-
based company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
