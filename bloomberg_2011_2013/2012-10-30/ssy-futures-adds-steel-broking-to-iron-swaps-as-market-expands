SSY Futures Ltd., a unit of the
worldâ€™s second-largest shipbroker, said it will start brokering
steel swaps as the market for iron-ore derivatives expands.  SSY is adding staff in  London  and Singapore and will cover
swaps on U.S. and European hot-rolled coil, steel billet and
reinforcement bars, the company said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. The  Singapore Exchange (SGX) , the largest clearer of iron-
ore contracts, handled swaps totaling 17.7 million metric tons
in September, compared with a monthly average of 7.2 million
tons last year, SSY said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
