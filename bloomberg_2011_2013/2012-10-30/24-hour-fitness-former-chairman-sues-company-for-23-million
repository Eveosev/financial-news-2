Chris A. Davis, the former chairman
of the 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide Inc. gym chain, sued the
company for $23 million, contending she’s owed payments for a
promised “phantom stock” award.  Davis, of  West Palm Beach ,  Florida , said she has served the
company faithfully as a board member since 2006, and as a result
of circumstances including the cost of commuting and renting an
apartment, she’s “impoverished” and was depending on the award
from the  San Ramon , California-based firm, a unit of Forstmann
Little & Co., which isn’t named in the suit.  Davis “has demanded payment in full, but defendant has
refused to make payment,” which she “believes exceeds $23
million,” her lawyers said in a complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  The lawyers said in court papers that Davis’s award might
soon be worth more, because 24 Hour Fitness “is currently
actively seeking a buyer,” which could boost its value.  They said the company wrote to Davis in September advising
her the award “is not a valid obligation of the company.”  A phantom stock award is a long-term benefit plan in which
the recipient holds the rights to the value of shares, not the
actual shares, until payout.  Forstmann, based in  New York , bought 24 Hour Fitness in
2005 as the world’s largest fitness center company, it said in a
statement at the time.  Wendy Yellin, a spokeswoman for 24 Hour Fitness, didn’t
immediately return a phone call and e-mail seeking comment on
the lawsuit.  The case is Davis v. 24 Hour Fitness, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
