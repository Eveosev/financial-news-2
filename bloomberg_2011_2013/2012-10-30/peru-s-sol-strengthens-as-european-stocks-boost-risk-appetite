Peru ’s sol rose for the first time
in more than a week as a rally in European stocks spurred demand
for emerging-market assets.  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5970 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  European stocks and the euro rose after companies from BP
Plc to Deutsche Bank AG reported earnings that exceeded
analysts’ estimates. The sol rebounded from a 0.8 percent fall
last week after the financial regulator proposed regulations
tightening restrictions on dollar sales.  “Holdings from banks were high and with the U.S. markets
closed,” there was less demand for the greenback, said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima.  U.S. exchanges are in the second day of a suspension called
to safeguard workers as  Hurricane Sandy  halted public transit
and forced evacuations in New York City.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 4.26 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The price rose 0.14 centimo to 123.32 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
