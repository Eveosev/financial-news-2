Former Anheuser-Busch Inc. Chairman
August Busch IV agreed to pay $1.75 million to the family of a
woman who died in his home in 2010 to resolve a wrongful death
lawsuit.  Most of the money will go to the son of Adrienne Martin,
according to a judge’s order approving the agreement filed
yesterday in state court in Cape Girardeau,  Missouri . Busch was
accused in a lawsuit last year of carelessness and negligence in
the death of Martin, who died while a guest at Busch’s home. Her
son was 8 at the time.  Busch denied the claims and allegations that he contributed
to her death, according to court filings.  “Mr. Busch cared deeply for Adrienne’s son, Blake Martin,
and is happy this long and at times bitter legal dispute is
finally over,” Maurice Graham, Busch’s attorney, said in an e-
mail. “The only remaining issue was the division of the total
settlement of $1,750,000. August’s concern was that Blake
receive as much of the total settlement as possible.”  John Heisserer, an attorney for Martin’s relatives, didn’t
return a voice-mail message yesterday seeking comment on the
agreement.  The  St. Louis  County prosecuting attorney, Robert
McCullough, called Martin’s death an accidental overdose at a
Feb. 10, 2011, press conference.  In 2008, InBev NV bought Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch
Cos., based in St. Louis, for $52 billion.  Anheuser-Busch InBev
NV (ABI) , based in Leuven,  Belgium , is the world’s biggest brewer.  The case is Martin v. Busch, 11SL-001294, Circuit Court of
St. Louis County, Missouri, 21st Judicial Circuit (Cape
Girardeau).  To contact the reporter on this story:
