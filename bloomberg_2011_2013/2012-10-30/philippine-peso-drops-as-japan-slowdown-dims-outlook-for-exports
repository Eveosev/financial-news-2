The  Philippine peso  advanced,
heading for a second monthly gain, after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
expanded its asset-purchase program to shore up economic growth,
supporting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The currency erased earlier losses after BOJ increased the
fund today by 11 trillion yen ($138 billion) to 66 trillion yen.
An earlier report showed factory output in  Japan  slumped 4.1
percent in September from August.  “The capital flows are favoring not only the peso but
other Asian currencies,” said Patrick Ella, an economist in
Manila at Security Bank Corp. “The central bank wants to
protect the export sector but it isn’t averse to peso
appreciation, just the speed of the gain.”  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 41.213 per dollar in  Manila ,
according to data from Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency has
appreciated 1.2 percent since Sept. 30, the second-best
performance among the 11 most-traded Asian currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. It reached 41.120 on Oct. 18, a level last seen in
March 2008, and may reach 41 by year-end, Ella said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose to 4.9 percent from 4.85
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Interest Rates  The  Philippines  shipped $687 million of goods to Japan in
August, a 4.6 percent gain from a year earlier that followed a
27 percent slump in July, official data showed. Growth in
shipments to Japan averaged  6.9 percent  so far this year, versus
14 percent in 2011 and 28 percent in 2010. Japan was the biggest
buyer of Philippine goods in August.  The nation’s economic peformance, growth prospects and
 interest-rate  advantage are pulling in capital from overseas,
central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said today.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has cut its benchmark interest
rate four times this year to a record-low  3.5 percent , partly to
curb the peso appreciation to help protect exporters. Tetangco
said on Oct. 26 lower rates would discourage capital inflows and
curb gains in the currency.  The yield on the 5.875 percent bonds due March 2032 climbed
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.73 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services. The treasury plans to
auction 9 billion pesos ($218 million) of five-year notes on
Nov. 6, according to its sales calendar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
