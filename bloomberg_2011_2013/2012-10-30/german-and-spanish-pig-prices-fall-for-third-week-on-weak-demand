Pig prices fell for a third week in
 Germany  and Spain and a fourth week in France on weak demand and
lower exports, German industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V. reported.  German pig prices dropped to 1.776 euros ($2.31) a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) from 1.796 euros last week and 1.876 euros three
weeks ago, Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in a  report  on its
website today.  Germany is the EU’s biggest pork producer, followed by
Spain and France, Eurostat data show. The EU has forecast output
of pig meat in the bloc will decline 3.2 percent next year on
higher feed costs and new animal welfare rules.  “The reasons for the Europe-wide price decline are broadly
similar factors: an adequate supply of slaughter pigs, weaker
demand for meat, slower exports,” ISN wrote.  French pig prices fell to 1.724 euros a kilogram from 1.777
euros last week, while those in  Spain  slipped to 1.873 euros
from 1.923 euros. Prices in the Netherlands,  Belgium ,  Italy  and
Denmark also declined, according to ISN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
