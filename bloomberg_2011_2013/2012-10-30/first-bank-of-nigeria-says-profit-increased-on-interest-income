First Bank of Nigeria Plc , the West
African country’s third-biggest lender by market value, said
nine-month earnings rose 49 percent as net interest income
jumped.  Profit after tax rose to 66.26 billion naira ($420 million)
from 44.64 billion naira in the year ago period, the Lagos-based
lender said in a statement published on the website of the
Nigerian Stock Exchange today. Revenue rose to 267.69 billion
naira from 225 billion naira, while interest income increased to
205.5 billion naira from 163.2 billion naira.  First Bank’s earnings are rising after  Nigeria  overhauled
its banking system following the debt crisis in 2008, with the
central bank firing the chief executive officers of eight of the
country’s lenders. It also set up Asset Management Corp. of
Nigeria, which bought non-performing loans from the lenders.
Companies listed on the Nigerian stock exchange converted to the
International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, from this
year following a government directive.  “The figures are pretty in line with my estimates, having
expected that the transition impact to IFRS on earnings would
moderate further in the third and fourth quarters,” Abiola Rasaq, a Lagos-based analyst with Vetiva Capital Management
Ltd., said by phone today.  First Bank fell 1.2 percent in Lagos trading, paring this
year’s gain to 83 percent. The  Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share
Index has increased 29 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
