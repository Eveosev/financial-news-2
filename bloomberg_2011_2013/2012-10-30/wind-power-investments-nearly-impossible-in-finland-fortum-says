It is nearly impossible to carry out
wind power investments in Finland because a patchwork of
environmental regulation thwarts projects, the country’s biggest
utility  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  said.  “When you’ve invested a lot of money and time to prepare
three or four wind farms, but not been able to build a single
turbine due to environmental regulation, you stop pushing for
new projects,” Peter Tuominen, public affairs manager for the
company’s nuclear operations, said today at an interview in
Helsinki.  Burdensome regulation may lead to Finland missing its wind-
power target of 6 terawatt-hours by 2020 from 220 megawatts in
June. The European Union requires member states to increase the
proportion of renewable energy production in gross final energy
consumption to an average 20 percent by 2020.  The country obtained 0.5 percent of its electricity use
from wind last year, the least in  Europe  except for three
countries with a zero share, according to the  European Wind
Energy Association .  Finland  may fall short of its wind power target since the
only viable projects are big offshore wind farms, which are
ineligible for a feed-in tariff subsidy of as much as 105.30
euros ($136) a megawatt-hour, Tuominen said.  “Regulatory issues and environmental aspects make onshore
wind power investments in Finland even more challenging than
constructing nuclear plants, indeed almost impossible,”
Tuominen said. “It’s a dilemma, since the areas with the best
wind conditions are the most sensitive environment-wise.”  After failing to develop onshore wind, the company will not
invest in offshore projects either, since it “lacks the
competence and technical knowledge,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
