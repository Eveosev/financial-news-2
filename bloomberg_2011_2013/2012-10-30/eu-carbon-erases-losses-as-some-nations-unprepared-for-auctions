European Union carbon permits rose,
erasing earlier losses as the European Energy Exchange AG said
some nations in the bloc were not yet ready to sell allowances
at auctions starting Nov. 13.  EU carbon for December advanced 0.9 percent to close at
8.15 euros ($10.57) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London .  They earlier today fell as much as 2.1 percent after EEX
said it would begin a program of sales amounting to 120 million
tons. About 40 million of the volume is subject to nations being
ready to make sales, the exchange said.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for the same
month increased 6.2 percent to 1.03 euros a ton. Emission
Reduction Units gained 5.5 percent to 77 cents a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
