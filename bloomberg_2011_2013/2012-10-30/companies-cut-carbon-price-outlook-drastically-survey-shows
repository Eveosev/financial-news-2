Companies in the European Union’s
emissions market lowered their expectations for carbon prices
“drastically,” according to a survey by  Germany ’s KfW
Bankengruppe and ZEW Center for European Economic Research.  The companies surveyed expect an average EU permit price in
December 2013 of about 14 euros ($18.16) a metric ton, or 36
percent lower than they expected last year, ZEW and KfW said in
their annual CO2 Barometer publication e-mailed today.  “As recently as last year companies had expected an
average price of about 22 euros for one ton of carbon dioxide by
the end of 2013,” the report said.  Two key factors that drive European Union carbon prices are
outlook for economic performance and policy regulation,
considered as important by respectively 85 percent and 75
percent of companies and carbon experts in the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
