The National Basketball Association
is assessing whether the Brooklyn Nets will open their season as
scheduled Nov. 1 at Barclays Center against the  New York  Knicks,
spokesman Tim Frank said in an e-mail.  New York is recovering from the effects of  Hurricane Sandy ,
which caused flooding and blackouts in the metropolitan area.  The opener was scheduled to be the first regular-season NBA
game for the Nets in the new arena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
