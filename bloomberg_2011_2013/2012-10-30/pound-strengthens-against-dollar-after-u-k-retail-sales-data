The pound advanced for the first
time in three days against the dollar as a report showed an
 index  of U.K. retail sales rose to a four-month high in October.  Ten-year  government bonds  fell as the Debt Management
Office sold 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) of three-year
gilts. Sterling dropped 0.5 percent in the past two days versus
the U.S. currency amid speculation the  Bank of England  would
boost stimulus measures after policy maker  Charles Bean  said the
economy has been “bumping along the bottom.” A report last
week showed U.K. gross domestic product expanded 1 percent in
the third quarter, emerging from a double-dip recession.  “The GDP number was strong enough to rule out further
monetary stimulus at the November BOE meeting and some of that
is in the price for sterling already,” said  Valentin Marinov ,
head of European Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in  London . “More resilience from upcoming U.K.
data releases would help sterling consolidate.”  The pound gained 0.3 percent to $1.6081 at 4:19 p.m. London
time after falling to $1.5914 on Oct. 23, the lowest level since
Sept. 6. Sterling weakened 0.2 percent to 80.66 pence per euro.  The gauge of annual retail-sales growth increased to 30
from 6 in September, the London-based  Confederation of British
Industry  said in a report today. Data tomorrow will show U.K.
 consumer confidence  held at minus 28 in October after rising to
a 15-month high in September, according to the median estimate
of 19 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Quantitative Easing  Bank of England policy makers, led by Governor  Mervyn King ,
voted 9-0 to maintain their asset-purchase  target , or
quantitative easing, at 375 billion pounds on Oct. 3-4,
according to minutes of the meeting released on Oct. 17.  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc.
have all switched their view on further quantitative easing in
the U.K. in the past week and no longer expect the Bank of
England to expand stimulus at its next policy meeting on Nov. 8.  An index based on a survey of  purchasing managers  will show
the U.K. manufacturing sector shrank in October when the  data  is
released on Nov. 1, according to the median forecast of 27
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The pound gained 1.6 percent this year according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro dropped 2.1 percent and
the dollar fell 2.2 percent.  Gilts Fall  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.82 percent after falling to 1.79
percent yesterday, the  least  since Oct. 16. The 1.75 percent
bond maturing in September 2022 dropped 0.22, or 2.20 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 99.34.  The Debt Management Office sold 4.75 percent gilts maturing
in September 2015 at an average yield of 0.304 percent.
Investors bid for 2.11 times the amount of securities allotted.  The U.K. last sold three-year gilts on May 19, 2011, at an
average yield of 1.456 percent.  The euro has so-called support around 80 pence from the 55-
day moving average and so-called resistance at 81.10 pence, its
200-day moving average,  Michael Hewson , a markets analyst at CMC
Markets Plc, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Resistance refers to an area where technical analysts
anticipate sell orders to be clustered. Support is where they
expect buy orders to be grouped.  Gilts returned 3 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
3.2 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
