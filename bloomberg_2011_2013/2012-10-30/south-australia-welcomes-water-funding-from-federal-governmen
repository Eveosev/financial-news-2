An A$265 million ($275 million)
funding commitment from the federal government for water
recovery projects in River Murray communities has been welcomed
by  South Australia â€™s premier.  Funding announced by the federal water minister yesterday
includes $180 million for the sustainable rural water use and
infrastructure program. South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill
said irrigators would benefit from the projects as would the
tourism, fishing and horticulture industries along the river.
The funding will be available over six years starting in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
