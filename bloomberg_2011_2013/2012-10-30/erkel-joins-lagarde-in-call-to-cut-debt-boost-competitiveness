The recovery of the global economy
is fragile and “unsustainably high” debt in major economies
requires  deficit reduction , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and
the leaders of the world’s top international economic
organizations said.  The euro region must implement economic-policy changes to
enhance growth and competitiveness, and the U.S. has to embark
on a path of credible fiscal consolidation, Merkel and leaders
including International Monetary Fund chief  Christine Lagarde 
said in a joint statement e-mailed after talks in Berlin today.  “Decisive action has to be taken to ensure fiscal
consolidation at an appropriate pace coupled with structural
reforms,” the leaders said in the statement distributed by the
Chancellery in Berlin. “Policy action will need to maximize
synergies between macroeconomic and structural instruments.”  The IMF earlier this month warned that the risk of a deeper
slowdown in the world economy would increase without a solution
to problems in the U.S. and  Europe . Growth in the world economy
will hardly accelerate, to 3.6 percent in 2013 from 3.3 percent
this year, according to today’s statement.  The release was issued on behalf of Merkel, Lagarde,
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Secretary-
General  Angel Gurria , World Trade Organization Director-General
Pascal Lamy, International Labor Organization Director-General
Guy Ryder and World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
