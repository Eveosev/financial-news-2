Lonmin (LMI)  Plc, the third-largest
platinum producer, has selected HSBC Holdings Plc and  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  to manage its planned $800 million share sale, two people
familiar with the plans said.  Lonmin also picked JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Standard Bank
Group Ltd. for the sale, the people said, asking not to be named
as the process is private. Officials at the banks declined to
make any immediate comment. Lonmin declined to comment, saying
it will release details of the transaction later.  The mining company needs the funds to avoid breaching debt
conditions set by lenders. A six-week wildcat pay strike at its
Marikana mine in South Africa cut output, curbing income from
sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
