Mark Sanchez will remain the  New
York  Jets’ starting quarterback even after the team’s 30-9 home
loss two days ago to the Miami Dolphins, keeping Tim Tebow as
the backup.  “Mark gives us the best chance to win,” coach Rex Ryan
told reporters yesterday on a conference call. “Can Tim be
successful? Yes, absolutely, and I think we need to look at that
as well.”  The Jets (3-5), who are in last place in the American
Football Conference’s East Division, don’t play again until Nov.
11 at the Seattle Seahawks.  Sanchez completed 28 of his 54 passes for 283 yards against
Miami, with one touchdown and one interception. He also lost a
fumble on one of his four sacks and ranks 30th in the 32-team
National Football League with a 72.8 quarterback rating.  “Mark’s our guy, I don’t think there’s any doubt about
that,” Ryan said. “I’m confident in Mark. We just have to look
as a whole what we can do. Are there things we can do to help?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
