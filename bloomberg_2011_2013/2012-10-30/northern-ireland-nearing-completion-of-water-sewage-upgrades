Northern Ireland  is nearing the
completion of $12 million of water and sewage upgrades at the
Clay Lake Water Treatment Works and a sewer facility at Keady in
County Armagh.  Completion of the Clay Lake Water project is expected in
March. Regional development minister Danny Kennedy last week
viewed the works, saying both projects “will bring significant
benefits to water and wastewater services for customers in Keady
and the surrounding area.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
