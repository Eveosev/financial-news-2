Coffee fell in London and  New York 
on signs of ample supplies. Cocoa and sugar gained.  Arabica coffee bean  inventories  in warehouses monitored by
the ICE Futures U.S. exchange in New York were little changed
yesterday at 2.4 million bags, near the highest since May 2010.
Exports from  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, may rise 23
percent in October from a month earlier, according to Rio de
Janeiro-based broker Flavour Coffee. World production may reach
160 million bags in the 2012-13 season, as output increases in
Honduras and  Mexico , INTL FCStone Inc. said Oct. 25.  “After the harvest from a high-yield year in Brazil had
already put pressure on prices of arabica coffee, this effect is
now being compounded by rising shipments from Central American
countries,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said in an e-mailed report today. “This is having a
dampening effect on price performance.”  Robusta coffee for January delivery slid 1 percent to
$1,995 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London by 10:39 a.m.
Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to $1.615
a pound on ICE.  Yesterday, coffee jumped 2.6 percent in New York on
speculation that Sandy, the Atlantic Ocean superstorm, would
damage coffee in warehouses in the northeast U.S. About 38
percent of U.S. green-coffee inventories were stored around the
New York area, including  New Jersey , the Green Coffee
Association said on Oct. 15.  “Concerns that coffee warehouses could be flooded by the
storm were partly behind the rise in coffee futures,” said
David Maloni, the president of the American Restaurant
Association, a Sarasota, Florida-based commodity researcher.
“Assuming no major damage has occurred, we anticipate coffee
prices to once again drift lower over the coming days,” he said
in an e-mailed report today.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery gained 0.3
percent to $525 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for March
delivery rose 0.6 percent to 19.53 cents a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for March delivery advanced 0.7 percent to 1,543
pounds ($2,478) a ton in  London . Cocoa for December delivery was
up 1 percent to $2,374 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
