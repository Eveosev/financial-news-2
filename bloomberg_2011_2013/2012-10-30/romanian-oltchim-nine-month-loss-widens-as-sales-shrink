Oltchim SA (OLT) ,  Romania ’s state-owned
chemical company, said its net loss widened in the first nine
months to 308.5 million lei ($88 million) from a loss of 179.8
million lei in the same period last year, according to a
statement sent to the Bucharest Stock Exchange today.  The company’s total sales declined to 693.7 million lei
from 1.26 billion lei, according to the statement.  Romania’s government may resume the sale of a majority
stake in Oltchim next year after it failed to sign a sale
contract with media entrepreneur Dan Diaconescu before a
deadline expired on Oct. 1, according to Prime Minister Victor Ponta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
