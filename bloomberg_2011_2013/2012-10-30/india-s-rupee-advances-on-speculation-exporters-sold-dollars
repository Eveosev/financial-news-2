India ’s rupee strengthened, after
fluctuating through the day, on speculation exporters sold
dollars to benefit from the best  exchange rate  in more than five
weeks.  The currency had earlier dropped as the central bank
maintained its key policy rate to fight price pressures, while
lowering lenders’ reserve requirements to revive growth. The
monetary authority also lowered its economic growth estimate for
the year through March 2013 to 5.8 percent from 6.8 percent and
lifted the inflation forecast to 7.5 percent from 7 percent.  “We saw some dollar sales towards the end of the
session,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a trader at  Development
Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “The monetary policy review was on
expected lines, and now we have to see what steps the government
takes to attract flows.”  The rupee rose 0.2 percent to 53.9675 per dollar in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
54.1975 earlier, the weakest since Sept. 21. One-month implied
volatility, a gauge of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, rose 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to
10.20 percent.  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao reduced the  cash reserve ratio  to
4.25 percent from 4.5 percent, the  Reserve Bank  of India said in
Mumbai today. The cut to a 36-year low, the fourth this year,
was predicted by 19 of 33 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey,
while four forecast 4 percent and the rest no change.  “Such an outcome is in line with consensus, but there was
a strong minority expecting a cut in the repurchase rate, so its
lack should hit the rupee,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “Growth will
take longer to rebound with high rates.”  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 54.92 per dollar
compared with 54.88 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were unchanged at
54.89. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set
price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
