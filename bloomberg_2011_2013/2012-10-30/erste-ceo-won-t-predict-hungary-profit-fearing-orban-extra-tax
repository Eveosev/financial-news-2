Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , the Austrian
owner of Hungary’s second-biggest lender, won’t predict when it
will return to profit in the country because that may give the
government an excuse to come up with a new tax to take it away.  “Quite frankly, if we would now announce a return to
profitability in 2013, we would just trigger some form of action
from the Hungarian government,” Erste Chief Executive Officer
Andreas Treichl told analysts in a conference call today. “It
would say, ‘Erste has just announced it will return to profits
in 2013, that’s why we increase taxes to make sure they will
not.’”  Erste had two consecutive quarters of profit in  Hungary ,
reporting net income of 8.6 million euros ($11 million) in the
three months through September today, helped by lower bad debt
charges. That followed seven periods of losses peaking at 480
million euros in the third quarter of 2011 due to Hungary’s
banking levy and to a law that forced lenders last year to
swallow currency losses on Swiss-franc denominated mortgages.  The quick succession of policy changes that is a trademark
of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s administration made
forecasting earnings difficult at any rate, Treichl said.  “There are so many open questions,” he said. “The
government is changing its taxation and economic plans on a
biweekly basis. This isn’t an environment where we want to
predict something.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
