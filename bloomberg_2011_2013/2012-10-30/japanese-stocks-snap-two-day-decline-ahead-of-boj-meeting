Japanese  stocks  declined for a third
day, reversing gains after the  Bank of Japan  today expanded its
asset-purchase program to 66 trillion yen ($830 billion) and the
yen climbed against all of its major counterparts.  Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that gets almost a third of
its sales in  North America , slid 2.5 percent after rising as
much as 0.8 percent.  Fujikura Ltd. (5803)  sank 4.6 percent after the
cable manufacturer halved its profit forecast. Sharp Corp.
jumped 6.2 percent on a report the electronics company is in
investment talks with Apple Inc., Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 1 percent to 8,841.98 at
the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, reversing gains of as much as 0.7
percent after the central bank expanded its asset-purchase fund
by 11 trillion yen. Volume on the gauge was more than 15 percent
above the 30-day average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index fell 0.9
percent to 733.46, with more than three shares dropping for each
that gained.  “Most people had forecast and priced in further easing
this time,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-
based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which manages the equivalent of
about 5 trillion yen ($63 billion). “Investors are selling to
lock in profit after the announcement, learning lessons from
September, when a rally lasted for only a few hours.”  The Topix rose 2 percent from Sept. 6 after the  European
Central Bank  started a global wave of monetary policy easing to
boost growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of
Japan following suit. Shares on the stock gauge traded at 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Easing Expectations  All but one of 27 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  had
predicted easing, with the majority expecting a 10 trillion yen
expansion. The central bank last eased policy on Sept. 19, when
it surprised markets by expanding its asset-purchase fund by 10
trillion yen.  The yen climbed after the Bank of Japan’s second round of
easing in two months disappointed some investors expecting more.
The yen appreciated to as high as 79.46 against the dollar today
in Tokyo, compared with 79.78 when  stock trading  opened today.
Japan’s currency strengthened to 102.37 against the euro from
102.97. A stronger yen cuts overseas income at Japanese
companies when repatriated.  Nissan slid 2.5 percent to 653 yen. Nintendo Co., a gaming
console maker that gets 34 percent of its sales in the Americas,
fell 1 percent to 10,040 yen, reversing earlier gains of as much
as 2.3 percent.  Hurricane Sandy  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.6 percent in New York. U.S.
equities trading was halted a second day as  Hurricane Sandy 
lashed the East Coast. Exchanges are planning to reopen tomorrow
if weather permits, according to statements from NYSE Euronext
and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.  Japan’s current earnings season peaks this week, with 571
of 1,672 Topix companies reporting results. Of the 400 companies
on the gauge that have reported quarterly revenue since Oct. 1
and for which Bloomberg News has estimates, 63 percent have
fallen short of expectations.  Fujikura lost 4.6 percent to 226 yen after cutting its
full-year net-income forecast 50 percent to 2 billion yen ($25
million), citing rising competition both in Japan and abroad.  Mitsumi Electric Co. (6767)  plunged 12 percent to 388 yen, the
biggest decline on the Nikkei 225 and the stock’s lowest level
since 1983, after the electronic-parts maker said it expects
loss of 12.5 billion yen in the year ending March 31.  Sharp soared 6.2 percent to 172 yen after  Kyodo News  said
the maker of liquid-crystal displays is in talks with Apple,
Google and Microsoft to jointly develop tablet computers and
supply the companies with panels. Miyuki Nakayama, a spokeswoman
for Sharp, declined to comment on the report of the tie-up talks.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 1.9 percent
to 19.99, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.7 percent
on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
