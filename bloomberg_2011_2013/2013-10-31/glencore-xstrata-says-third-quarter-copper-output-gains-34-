Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) , the mining
company created in a $29 billion deal five months ago, said
quarterly production of copper increased 34 percent as African
mines added to volumes.  Output from its own mines was 412,900 metric tons in the
three months through September, Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore
said today in a regulatory statement. Total copper production
including feed from third-party sources was 695,600 tons. The
figures include operations acquired from Xstrata Plc.  Glencore completed a 15-month takeover of Xstrata in May to
create the fourth-largest mining company, now valued at $74
billion. Copper and coal sales are the biggest contributors to
earnings. The trader and minerals producer last month trimmed
its spending budget for the three years through to 2015 by $3.5
billion from $29 billion to combat declining demand and prices.  The group has interests in more than 35 coal mines in
Colombia, Africa and  Australia , accounting for about 10 percent
of global seaborne supplies of the fuel. Glencore teamed up
 Japan ’s  Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  last week to buy a $1 billion controlling
stake in an Australian  coal mine .  Total coal output gained 9 percent to 36.8 million tons in
the quarter, it said. Zinc production dropped 12 percent to
332,200 tons, lead increased 5 percent to 80,700 tons and nickel
retreated 6 percent to 22,500 tons.  The  stock  climbed 0.8 percent to close at 345.05 pence in
London trading yesterday. It’s up 1.3 percent this year.  Project Review  In September the company estimated cost savings of $2
billion next year through combining with Xstrata. The forecast
included $1.4 billion saved by closing 33 Xstrata offices,
firing workers and cutting costs at existing operations.  A review of 88 projects acquired from Xstrata resulted in
activities at 44 of them being suspended, Glencore said in
September. A month earlier the company wrote down the value of
assets acquired in the takeover by $7.7 billion to reflect the
“broader negative mining industry environment.” Glencore, the
world’s biggest exporter of power-station coal, reported a
first-half net loss of $8.9 billion on the writedowns.  The group employs about 190,000 people in more than 50
countries across its industrial and trading divisions. The
takeover of Xstrata was completed almost two years after
Glencore’s $10 billion initial public offering, which ended more
than three decades of it operating as a closely held company.  Peter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent of
 Bloomberg News , is a non-executive director of Glencore Xstrata.  To contact the reporter on this story:
