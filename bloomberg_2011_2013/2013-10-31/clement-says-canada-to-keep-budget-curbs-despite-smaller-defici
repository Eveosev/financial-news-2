Canada won’t change its spending
restraint policy even though it’s recording budget deficits that
are smaller than forecast, Treasury Board President  Tony Clement 
said.  Speaking to reporters in Toronto, Clement said “the
success of our economic future is directly tied to our ability
to balance our budget so we are rock-solid in our view that we
are on track and we will continue to restrain spending.”  Last week, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  announced that the
budget deficit for the fiscal year that ended in March was
C$18.9 billion ($18.1 billion), C$7 billion less than had been
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
