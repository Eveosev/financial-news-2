Schroders Plc (SDR) , the U.K.’s biggest
 fund manager  by assets, agreed to rent an office complex in the
City of London financial district being built by  Brookfield
Office Properties Inc. (BPO)  and the Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System’s real estate unit.  Schroders reached a deal with Brookfield and Oxford
Properties Group Inc. to lease all of One London Wall Place, a
12-story, 310,000-square-foot (28,800 square meter) development
due to be completed in the second half of 2017, the fund manager
said in an e-mailed statement today. Schroders said it currently
operates out of five locations in the City.  “Schroders has grown substantially in recent years and One
London Wall Place offers us a unique opportunity to consolidate
all  London  employees under one roof,” Schroders Chief Executive
Officer Michael Dobson said in the statement.  U.K. companies are increasingly moving to new offices as
the nation’s economy improves. More than 7.4 million square feet
of central London office space was leased in the first nine
months of 2013, more than was leased in all of last year, broker
Cushman & Wakefield Inc. said in a report last month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
