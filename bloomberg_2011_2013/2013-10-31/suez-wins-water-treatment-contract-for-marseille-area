Suez Environnement (SEV) , Europe’s second-largest water company, won a wastewater-treatment contract for
the Marseille metropolitan area that’s worth 1.2 billion euros
($1.63 billion) over 15 years.  The order will generate an average of 80 million euros a
year in revenue over the period, the Paris-based utility said
today in a statement. Suez will handle the operating contract
through Lyonnaise des Eaux’s subsidiary Seram.  Suez and bigger rival  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  compete in
France and abroad for municipal and industrial water and waste
contracts. The utilities are facing pressure in French cities
where agreements are up for renewal at lower prices than past
contracts.  Veolia earlier this month reached an agreement to renew a
water contract for the greater Marseille region, France’s third-most populous metropolitan area, that will reduce prices by
about a fifth.  Suez’s Marseille contract will be governed by a specially-created company and calls for construction of a stormwater pond
aimed at reducing the amount of untreated pollution that goes
into waterways during heavy rainfall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
