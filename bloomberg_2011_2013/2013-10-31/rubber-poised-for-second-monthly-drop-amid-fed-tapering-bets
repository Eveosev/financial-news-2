Rubber declined for the first time
in four days as speculation the  Federal Reserve  may cut stimulus
sooner than previously expected weighed on investor sentiment.  The contract for delivery in April, the most active by
volume on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, lost as much as 1.3
percent to 261 yen a kilogram ($2,651 a metric ton) and was at
261.3 yen at 11:34 a.m. local time. Futures fallen 1.7 percent
this month.  The Fed maintained its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases yesterday, saying it needs to see more evidence that
the economy is improving while noting signs of “underlying
strength.”  “Speculation on Fed tapering was negative for rubber,”
said Megumi Saito, a trader at commodity broker Yutaka Shoji Co.
in Tokyo. “An increase in stockpiles also puts pressure on
prices.”  Crude rubber stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses rose 21
percent to 5,314 tons on Oct. 20, according to data from the
Rubber Trade Association of Japan.  The market will remain in a surplus this year and next year,
though below 250,000 tons, Macquarie Group said in a report
dated Oct. 29. Consumption will grow 2.8 percent this year and
3.4 percent in 2014, the bank said.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell 1.9 percent to 19,685  yuan  ($3,231) a ton. Thai rubber
free-on-board rose 0.3 percent to 78.35 baht ($2.52) a kilogram
yesterday, recovering from a three-week low, according to the
Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
