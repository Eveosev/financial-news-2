Germany ’s 10-year government bonds
fell, snapping a seven-day gain, after the  Federal Reserve  said
yesterday it sees signs of “underlying strength” in the
world’s largest economy.  Benchmark bunds were set for their second monthly advance,
with 10-year yields about one basis point from the lowest level
since August as a report showed retail sales fell in September.
Separate data showed German  consumer confidence  slipped from the
highest level in six years. The Fed yesterday maintained its
monthly bond purchases at $85 billion while it evaluates more
data to see if the U.S economy will continue to strengthen.  “The Fed is not as dovish as many might have hoped as they
didn’t suggest tapering is off the table,” said  Michael Leister , a senior rates strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London .
“That pushed bond yields higher. You may argue that data in
Germany is a mixed bag, but overall confidence is still
robust.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.70 percent as of 8:08 a.m. London time.
The yield fell to 1.69 percent yesterday, the  lowest  since Aug.
12. It has dropped seven basis points this month. The 2 percent
security due in August 2023 fell 0.125, or 1.25 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,370) face amount, to 102.665.  German  retail sales  dropped 0.4 percent last month after
declining a revised 0.2 percent in August, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said.  Consumer confidence  will
fall to 7 in November from 7.1 this month, GfK AG said in a
separate report. October’s reading was the highest since
September 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German bonds lost 1.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s returned 11
percent, while Italy’s gained 6.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
