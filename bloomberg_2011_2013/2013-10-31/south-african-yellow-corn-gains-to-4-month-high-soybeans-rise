South African yellow corn futures
gained to the highest level in more than four months by the noon
close in Johannesburg. Soybeans also rose.  Yellow corn for delivery in December rose 1.1 percent to
2,311 rand ($232) a metric ton, the contract’s highest since
June 27, by the close on the South African Futures Exchange. The
white variety for delivery in the same month, increased 0.6
percent to 2,399 rand a ton.  South Africa is the continent’s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  Soybeans gained 1.4 percent to 5,860 rand a ton, the
highest since Sept. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
