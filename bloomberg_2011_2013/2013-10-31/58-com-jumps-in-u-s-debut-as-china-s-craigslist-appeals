58.Com Inc. (WUBA) , a Craigslist-like
Chinese online marketplace, jumped on its first day of trading
after raising $187 million in the biggest U.S. debut by a
Chinese company this year.  American depositary receipts of the Beijing-based
classifieds website surged 50 percent to $25.43 at 1:52 p.m. in
New York. The company sold 11 million ADRs for $17 apiece,
according to its statement, higher than its initial target range
of $13 to $15, which was later raised to $15 to $16. Morgan
Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. were lead
managers of the sale.  The sale became the fourth and biggest initial public
offering by a Chinese company in the U.S. this year, after web
retailer  LightInTheBox Holding Co. (LITB)  raised $78.9 million in June,
followed by China Commercial Credit Inc. and Montage Technology
Group Ltd. The number of offerings has rebounded from a low of
three in 2012 and is down from the 13 in 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “The market favors companies like us, so that we had to
raise price targets twice before the IPO completed,” Jinbo Yao,
58.Com’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said in a phone
interview in New York. “I don’t like this jump in price right
at the start of trading because that will put excessive pressure
on our performance. I’d rather see our future business
improvements reflected in gradual price appreciation.”  Qunar, 500.com  58.Com posted net income of $285,000 for the first half
this year, compared with a net loss of $19.3 million a year
earlier, its prospectus showed. The company’s revenue, mainly
from merchant membership charges and sales from customers’
online marketing, jumped 51 percent to $58.8 million in the six
months through June.  The company, founded in 2005 by CEO Yao, had grown its
average quarterly paying business members 16 times since 2010 to
273,000 in the first half of this year.  Travel-booking website Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd. increased
its IPO target price by as much as 26 percent yesterday, while
online sports lottery operator 500.com Ltd. filed for a $150
million IPO Oct. 22.  The number of share sales have dropped from 38 in 2010, as
allegations by short sellers such as Muddy Waters LLC against
Chinese targets have deterred companies from selling shares in
the past two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
