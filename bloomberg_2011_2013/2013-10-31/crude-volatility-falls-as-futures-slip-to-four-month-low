Crude options volatility fell as the
underlying futures slipped to a four-month low.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
19.36 percent at 3:35 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
down from 19.92 percent yesterday. Puts protecting against a 10
percent drop in prices were 27.99 percent compared with 28.02 in
the prior session.  “People are still bearish, realizing supply levels are
still overwhelming,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “Today was the end of the month
and expiration of products, and there weren’t a lot of new bets
put on.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery
declined 39 cents to $96.38 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest
level since June 26. Prices dropped 5.8 percent this month.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for five of
the six most-popular options and 51 percent of electronic
trading volume today.  The most-active options were December $100 calls, which
fell 15 cents to 29 cents a barrel with 3,774 lots trading as of
3:40 p.m. December $90 puts declined 2 cents to 17 cents with
volume of 2,975 lots.  In the previous session, the two most-active options were
puts, which accounted for 57 percent of the 102,498 lots traded.
December $95 puts rose 32 cents to 94 cents a barrel with 7,589
contracts trading. December $90 puts advanced 6 cents to 19
cents on volume of 7,201 lots.  Open interest in the prior session was highest for December
$90 puts, with 43,233 contracts. Next were December $80 puts
with 42,309 lots and December $85 puts with 36,874.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
