Pork stockpiles in the U.S.
fell 10.2 percent at the end of September from a year
earlier, the government said, as animal weights increased.  Warehouses held 566.367 million pounds of pork, down
from 630.446 million on Sept. 30, 2012, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said today in a report. Inventories rose 3.2
percent from the end of August.  Carcass weights rose 1.6 percent in September, and
have increased 1.3 percent this month through Oct. 29,
government data show. The price of corn, the main feed
ingredient, fell 8.4 percent in September. U.S. exporters
shipped 3.254 billion pounds (1.48 million metric tons) of
pork in the eight months through Aug. 31, down 8.6 percent
from a year earlier, the latest USDA data show.  “The export pace has slowed down,”  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines,
 Iowa , said in a telephone interview before the report.
“The weights from the end of August through September have
been higher too. That could add to” inventories, he said.  As of Sept. 30, stockpiles of pork bellies, which are
cured and sliced to make bacon, rose 45.3 percent from a
year earlier to 22.761 million pounds, according to today’s
report. Warehouse supplies of ham climbed to a record
221.231 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of September were
1.3 percent larger than a year earlier at 658.975 million
pounds, the USDA said. Beef supplies rose 4.7 percent to
445.047 million pounds during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
