Shares of Shanghai Chaori Solar
Energy Science & Technology Co., a Chinese maker of solar
panels, are poised to be suspended after the company said it
expected a net loss this year.  The Shenzhen stock exchange told the company that its stock
would be suspended from trading and its bonds delisted if it
reported a net loss in 2013, Shanghai-based Chaori Solar said in
a statement dated yesterday. It had a net loss of 534 million
 yuan  ($88 million) in the first nine months, the company said.  Chaori Solar forecast in the statement an annual loss in
2013, its third straight yearly loss, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It comes as a global oversupply cut profits of
solar-energy component makers in the past two years.  Trading of Chaori’s March 2017 bonds were halted July 8.
The bonds will have 89.8 million yuan of interest payments due
on March 7, the company said in yesterday’s statement.  The company plans to sell 52 megawatts of solar farms in
Bulgaria and  Greece  to pay the bond interests, it said.  Shunfeng
Photovoltaic International Ltd. (1165)  may be interested in buying the
assets worth about 119 million euros ($163 million), it added.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
