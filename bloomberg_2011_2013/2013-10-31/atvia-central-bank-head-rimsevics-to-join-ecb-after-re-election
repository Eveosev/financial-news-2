Latvian lawmakers re-elected central
bank Governor Ilmars Rimsevics two months before the Baltic
nation becomes the euro area’s 18th member.  The 100-seat legislature in the capital, Riga, voted 76-3
today to give him a third six-year term. Rimsevics will become a
voting member of the  European Central Bank  after Latvia adopts
the euro on Jan. 1.  Rimsevics championed the common currency even after the
government missed targets to switch in 2008 and 2012 and as more
than half of Latvians opposed the move. The country’s economy
shrank the most in the world in 2009. It may expand 4.2 percent
this year and next, the European Union’s fastest pace, after
growing more than 5 percent in 2011 and 2012, according to the
 Finance Ministry .  Rimsevics, 48, became deputy central bank governor in 1992
and has led the regulator since 2001. He got a master’s degree
in business administration in 1992 from Clarkson University in
Potsdam,  New York . He graduated from the Riga Technical
University as an engineering economist in 1990, according to the
Latvian central bank.  About 52 percent of Latvians opposed euro adoption in
September, according to pollster SKDS. Twenty-four percent were
in favor of the currency switch and 22 percent had a neutral
view, its survey showed. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
