Codelco, the world’s biggest copper
producer, is poised to raise the fee it charges Chinese buyers
to the highest since 2005 as demand increases in the world’s
biggest user of the metal, a survey shows.  The surcharge added to the price of copper for immediate
delivery on the  London  Metal Exchange may climb 38 percent to
$135 per metric ton in 2014 from $98 this year, according to the
median of 14 estimates from company executives, traders and
analysts contacted by Bloomberg this week. Codelco has already
increased the premium it charges European buyers by 32 percent.  Higher fees would shore up profit at the Chilean miner that
earns more than 90 percent of its revenue from the metal and
faces an 8.8 percent slump in futures prices in London this
year. China’s copper imports surged to a 19-month high in
September as economic growth accelerated and demand is set to
increase 6.5 percent in 2014, Barclays Plc estimates.  “The premium is sure to go up,” said Li Chunlan, an
analyst in Beijing for London-based researcher CRU. Any
potential easing in demand for copper for Chinese industry and
construction would be offset by imports of the metal to use as
collateral to get funding for other business ventures, said Li.  The probable higher fees add to signs of strength in the
Chinese economy after concern of a slowdown earlier this year
when gross domestic product growth slowed in the first and
second quarters. The odds of a credit crisis are decreasing on
expectations a Communist Party summit in November will take
steps to scale back local-government debt and shadow banking, a
Bloomberg survey indicated.  LME Prices  Officials at Santiago-based Codelco declined to comment on
the fees.  China  accounts for about a third of the company’s
annual sales.  The premium is added to LME spot prices to cover costs
including shipping and insurance. It was as high as $138 in
2005, according to CRU.  The metal for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.6 percent to 51,760  yuan  ($8,494) a ton at 2:37
p.m. local time while the contract for delivery in three months
on the LME fell 0.8 percent to $7,232.50 a ton.  The price Codelco will charge European buyers next year has
been raised to $112 a metric ton, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the matter. The new fee is the highest since
2008, according to data from CRU.  Chinese users may sign more annual contracts with Codelco
and other miners and make fewer purchases from the  spot market 
due to the risk of volatility in prices, CRU’s Li said.  Mine Disruptions  Mine disruptions may return to near the nine-year average
of 990,000 tons in 2014 and 2015, from an estimated 460,000 tons
this year, Deutsche Bank said Oct. 16.  The  premium  for imported copper under spot contracts, an
indication of the metal’s availability, was at $195 per ton,
compared with a record $210 in early August, according to data
provided by SMM Information & Technology Co.  Pan Pacific Copper Co.,  Japan ’s biggest producer, increased
its premium for China by 45 percent for 2014 to $123, reflecting
higher spot surcharges.  China’s refined copper consumption may increase 6.5 percent
to about 8.7 million tons in 2014 while imports remain
relatively stable compared with recent years, said Yang Changhua, a researcher with Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. There’s likely to be a deficit of about 1.9
million tons in China next year, Yang said.  The Asian nation will keep leading the world’s consumption
growth in 2013 at a rate of 6.2 percent, Codelco said at an
investor presentation this month.  While China is the world’s largest copper producing nation,
it doesn’t produce enough to meet its own needs.  Inventories in  Asia  tracked by the LME and the Shanghai
Futures Exchange slumped 31 percent from an all-time high
reached June 24.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
