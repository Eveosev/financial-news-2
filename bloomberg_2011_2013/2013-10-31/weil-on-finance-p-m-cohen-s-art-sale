Welcome back, View fans. Time for more fun with annotated afternoon links. Wall Street  celebrity  art  watch Steven Cohen is selling about $80 million worth of blue-chip art at auction, the New York Times reports. The sales come just as his hedge fund SAC Capital has reached a deal to plead guilty to securities fraud, according to unidentified people who spoke to the Times reporters. Coincidence? Cohen's art adviser says we're in a robust market, and that’s probably right. The works include two Warhols. Of course, how could financial-scandal aficionados forget that Dick Fuld and his wife sold a nice slug of their art collection shortly after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy?  Financial Times op-ed writer to JPMorgan:  Go to trial ! I'm all for it. We might actually find out if any of the government's allegations are true. But Jacob Frenkel of the Shulman Rogers law firm goes a step too far in my book when he asks: "Why should a bank bother fighting a winnable case when it can just write a check and make it go away?" My question back is: How does he know that JPMorgan has a winnable case? We don't know what evidence the prosecutors have. Bank of America thought it had a winning case before it lost a civil trial against the Justice Department last week. Still, I dig the fire in the belly: "Many of us experienced former prosecutors would gladly take it to court. It would be a trial lawyer’s dream: cross-examine all the senior government officials who groveled on the marble floors of JPMorgan, begging it to save the U.S. and take over Bear Stearns and WaMu." Dr. Doom sees  bubbles  in the broth From Nouriel Roubini, writing about the Federal Reserve's easy-money policies: "All of this excess liquidity is flowing to the financial sector rather than the real economy. Near-zero policy rates encourage “carry trades” –- debt-financed investment in higher-yielding risky assets such as longer-term government and private bonds, equities, commodities and currencies of countries with high interest rates. The result has been frothy financial markets that could eventually turn bubbly." Worth a read. Bil l Gross can't stop making  news The Pimco co-founder wrote in his monthly investment outlook that the top 1 percent should pay higher taxes. Here's the speed read: "1) Growth depends on investment and investment in part depends on an equitable rebalancing of personal income taxes, capital gains and carried interest. 2) The era of taxing `capital' at lower rates than `labor' should end. 3) Investors in the U.S. and elsewhere must look for investment in the real economy, not share buy-back maneuvers that artificially elevate stock prices." Also worth a read. Weird  statistic  of the day The biggest air-crash danger? Flying into a hillside. Who knew?  (Jonathan Weil is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
