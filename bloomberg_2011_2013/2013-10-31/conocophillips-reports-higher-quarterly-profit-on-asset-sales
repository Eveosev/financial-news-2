ConocoPhillips (COP) , the largest U.S.
independent oil and natural gas producer, increased third-quarter profit 38 percent after selling assets.  Net income advanced to $2.5 billion, or $2 a share, from
$1.8 billion, or $1.46, a year earlier, Houston-based
ConocoPhillips said in a statement today. Excluding certain one-time items, per-share profit was 2 cents higher than the $1.45
 average  of 22 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  ConocoPhillips has been overhauling its business since
announcing in 2009 a plan to sell assets and boost returns. It
had a gain of $749 million in the quarter from disposals
including the Clyden oil-sands lease in  Canada  and a midstream
holding in  Trinidad and Tobago . Today it said it closed the sale
of its stake in the Kashagan project in  Kazakhstan  for about
$5.4 billion.  “The company just continues to execute well on its
strategy of reducing the risk profile and refocusing back on the
U.S.,” Brian Youngberg, an analyst at  Edward Jones  in  St. Louis 
who has a hold rating on ConocoPhillips shares and owns none,
said in a phone interview today. “They’re moving forward with
that strategy.”  The explorer is looking to areas such as the Eagle Ford and
Bakken formations in the U.S. to increase oil output, and it has
projects planned in locations such as Canada and the North Sea.
ConocoPhillips spun off refining, chemical and pipeline assets
as  Phillips 66 (PSX)  in April 2012.  Output Forecast  Third-quarter production from continuing operations was the
equivalent of 1.47 million barrels a day, the same as a year
earlier. The company trimmed its daily forecast on that basis
for all of 2013 to a range of 1.505 million to 1.515 million
barrels, compared with an earlier estimate of as much as 1.53
million.  ConocoPhillips said its fourth-quarter production forecast
is unchanged, except for about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent
a day in disruptions in  Libya .  Revenue  rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier to $15.5
billion in the quarter.  Oil futures traded in New York rose 15 percent from a year
earlier to average $105.81 a barrel in the third quarter. Gas
futures traded in New York averaged $3.555 per million British
thermal units in the quarter, a 23 percent rise from a year
earlier.  The earnings statement was issued before the opening of
regular trading on U.S. markets. ConocoPhillips rose 1.1 percent
to $74.05 by 8:28 a.m. in premarket trading in New York.  Independent producers don’t own refineries or chemical
businesses.  (ConocoPhillips is scheduled to hold an earnings conference
call at 1 p.m.  New York  time, accessible at
