58.Com Inc. (WUBA) , a Craigslist-like
Chinese online marketplace, jumped on its first day of trading
after its U.S. initial public offering exceeded target.  NQ
Mobile Inc. (NQ)  rebounded for a third day to pare a monthly slump.  58.Com’s American depositary receipts surged 42 percent to
$24.12 in New York. The Beijing-based company raised $187
million in the IPO for $17 apiece, higher than its initial
target range of $13 to $15. NQ Mobile jumped 18 percent,
rebounding after a 62 percent tumble that followed Muddy Waters
LLC’s Oct. 24 report alleging it inflated sales. The Bloomberg
China-US Index of the most traded Chinese stocks in the U.S.
fell 0.7 percent, paring its fourth monthly gain to 1 percent.  The share offering of the classifieds website became the
fourth and biggest IPO by a Chinese company in the U.S. this
year. NQ Mobile surged 64 percent in the past three days after
the company took steps to make its cash deposits more
transparent and issued documents to refute  Muddy Waters ’
allegations that the  software company  inflated sales and
misrepresented cash balances.  The deal “really benefits from indiscriminate demand for
small to mid-cap IPOs in specialty industries, such as
technology and Internet related,” Josef Schuster, founder of
IPOX Schuster LLC in Chicago said in e-mailed comments. “It
looks like the scrutiny surrounding NQ Mobile has not had an
effect.”  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 0.1 percent to $37.57 in
New York, for a 1.3 percent gain for the month. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.4 percent, capping a monthly rally of
4.5 percent.  Membership Growth  58.Com, founded in 2005 by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Jinbo Yao, raised its IPO price target range to $15-$16
before the completion, its filings showed. Morgan Stanley,
Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. were the lead-managers
of the sale.  The company posted net income of $285,000 for the first
half this year, compared with a net loss of $19.3 million a year
earlier, its prospectus showed. Its revenue, mainly from
merchant membership charges and sales from customers’ online
marketing, jumped 51 percent to $58.8 million in the six months
through June. Average quarterly paying members had grown 16
times since 2010 to 273,000 in the first half of this year.  “The market favors companies like us, so that we had to
raise price targets twice before the IPO completed,” CEO Yao,
said in a phone interview in  New York . “I don’t like this jump
in price right at the start of trading because that will put
excessive pressure on our performance. I’d rather see our future
business improvements reflected in gradual price appreciation.”  Qunar IPO  Travel-booking website Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd., which is
planning an IPO today, increased its target price by as much as
26 percent Oct. 30, while online sports lottery operator 500.com
Ltd. filed for a $150 million debut Oct. 22.  The number of Chinese IPOs in the U.S. this year has
rebounded from a low of three in 2012 and is down from the 13 in
2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chinese web retailer LightInTheBox Holding Co. raised $78.9
million in June, followed by China Commercial Credit Inc. and
Montage Technology Group Ltd.  NQ Mobile’s ADRs surged to $14.40, the highest close since
its 47 percent plunge on Oct. 24, after Muddy Waters said
investors should sell the stock.  TAL Education Group, a private tutoring service provider
based in Beijing, retreated 2.1 percent from a record high to
$19.19 in New York. Its 32 percent surge for the month was the
biggest on the China-US gauge.  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) , an online
retailer of clothing based in  Guangzhou , climbed 2.4 percent to
$68.93 for a monthly rally of 21 percent.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in  Hong Kong  advanced
3 percent in October to 10,627.02, its fourth month of advances.
The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  retreated 1.5 percent for the month
to 2,141.61, snapping three months of increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
