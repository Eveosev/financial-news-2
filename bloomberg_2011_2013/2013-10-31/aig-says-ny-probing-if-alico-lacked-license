American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
said regulators in New York are probing whether former
subsidiaries lacked proper licenses and provided misleading
information.  The insurer is responding to requests from the New York
Department of Financial Services and Manhattan District
Attorney’s Office for information about Alico and Delaware
American, which were sold to  MetLife Inc. (MET)  in 2010, AIG said
today in a regulatory filing.  “The inquiries relate to whether Alico, DelAm and their
representatives conducted insurance business in New York over an
extended period of time without a license, and whether certain
representations by Alico concerning its activities in New York
were accurate,” according to the filing.  Jon Diat, a spokesman for New York-based AIG, declined to
comment as did  Matt Anderson  of the Department of Financial
Services and Joan Vollero of the District Attorney’s Office.  MetLife has previously said it was contacted by regulators
about whether the operations did business without a license.
John Calagna, a spokesman for New York-based MetLife, declined
