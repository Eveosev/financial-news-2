Iran  may be forced to impose water
rationing in Tehran should the capital’s residents fail to cut
consumption by about 20 percent, Iranian Energy Minister Hamid
Chitchian said.  Water rationing is under consideration in part as levels of
reservoirs outside Tehran have fallen due to a sharp decline in
rainfall this year, Chitchian told reporters after a Cabinet
meeting yesterday, according to the  Tehran Times  newspaper.  His comments follow those by President Hassan Rouhani, who
this week called for a national water-conservation plan to
address Iran’s “historic” water shortage. Overuse of city tap
water should be curbed, the farm industry must become more
efficient and use irrigation, and protecting underground sources
and preventing illegal drilling of wells is needed, said
Rouhani, who took office in August.  Iran, holder of the fourth-largest proven oil reserves
whose population has grown to 77 million amid recent dry spells,
will struggle to meet its water needs in coming years, the
Ankara-based  Center for Middle Eastern Strategic Studies’ Water
Research Programme  said in a July report.  Chitchian said at least 100 billion cubic meters of water
have been extracted from strategic underground waters in recent
years, causing wells in farmlands to turn salty, the Tehran-based paper said. About 12 million people reside in the Tehran
metropolitan area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
