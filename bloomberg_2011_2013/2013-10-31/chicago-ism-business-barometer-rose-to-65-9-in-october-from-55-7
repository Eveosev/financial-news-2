Business activity expanded in
October at the fastest pace since March 2011 as orders and
production surged, indicating U.S. manufacturing is gaining
traction and will help fuel the world’s biggest economy.  The MNI Chicago Report business barometer jumped to 65.9
from 55.7 in September, the biggest monthly increase in more
than three decades. Readings above 50 signal expansion. The
index exceeded the most optimistic estimate in Bloomberg survey,
in which the median projection was 55. A gauge of orders
advanced to the highest level in nine years.  The figures show demand strengthened through the budget
impasse that resulted in a partial federal government shutdown
for half the month. Recovering overseas markets, along with
gains in the U.S. auto and housing industries, will help keep
factory floors humming.  “Manufacturing in the Midwest is getting a lift from
autos, which have been a driving force for manufacturing over
the past year or so,” said  Ryan Sweet , senior economist at
Moody’s Analytics Inc. in  West Chester ,  Pennsylvania . Still,
“anytime you get a big swing of this magnitude, you always want
to take it with a grain of salt, particularly with the slowing
in the domestic economy and the heightened policy uncertainty.”  Stocks dropped as investors assessed corporate earnings.
The  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index declined 0.3 percent to 1,757.79
at 10:31 a.m. in  New York .  The 10.2-point surge in the Chicago gauge was the biggest
since July 1983. Estimates of 54 economists in the Bloomberg
survey ranged from 51 to 58.3. The index averaged 54.6 in 2012
and 62.8 in 2011.  Jobless Claims  Another report today showed fewer Americans filed
applications for  unemployment benefits  last week as a backlog in
 California ’s reporting cleared.  Jobless claims  decreased by 10,000 to 340,000 in the week
ended Oct. 26 from 350,000 the prior period, the Labor
Department reported in  Washington . The median forecast of 49
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a decrease to
338,000. California said no claims last week represented
applications from prior weeks, a Labor Department spokesman said
as the figures were released.  The Chicago group’s gauge of new orders increased to 74.3
this month, the highest since October 2004, from 58.9 in
September. The production index rose to 71.1, the highest since
February 2011, from 58 last month, according to today’s report.
A measure of employment rose to a four-month high of 57.7 from
53.2.  Order Backlogs  An index of order backlogs climbed to 61 in October from
46.7, the highest since March 2011.  Economists monitor the Chicago index and other regional
reports for an early reading on the national manufacturing
outlook. The Chicago group includes goods producers and service
providers with operations in the U.S. and abroad, making the
gauge a measure of overall growth.  Other regional indexes have been mixed. The Federal Reserve
Bank of New York’s general economic index fell to a five-month
low of 1.5 in October from 6.3 in September. Readings greater
than zero signal growth in New York, northern  New Jersey  and
southern  Connecticut .  Factory activity gauged by the  Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia ’s expanded more than projected in October. The
index fell to 19.8 this month from 22.3 in September.  Government Shutdown  The government was partly closed Oct. 1 through Oct. 16
after Congress failed to break a deadlock over whether to tie
changes to the 2010 Affordable Care Act to a short-term
extension of funding. The closing resulted in at least $24
billion of lost economic output, according to Standard & Poor’s.  The budget impasse and debt-ceiling debate took a toll on
confidence. Sentiment among U.S. consumers declined in October
by the most since August 2011, the Conference Board in New York
said this week.  While budget issues in Washington are hampering progress,
some companies such as  Kennametal Inc. (KMT) , which produces tools and
tooling systems, see signs of sustained growth in the global
economy.  “In the U.S., there have been various concerns about the
economy as well as the fiscal budget issues and tax increases as
well as the federal spending sequester,” Carlos Cardoso,
chairman and chief executive officer at Latrobe, Pennsylvania-based Kennametal, said on an Oct. 24 earnings call. “Business
conditions continue to be tentative” Still, “the foundation of
a recovery remains strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
