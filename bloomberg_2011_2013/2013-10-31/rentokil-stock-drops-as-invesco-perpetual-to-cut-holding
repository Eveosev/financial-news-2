Rentokil Initial Plc (RTO)  dropped the
most in 4 1/2 years after  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  said it’s selling
almost 193.7 million shares in the U.K. pest-control and
hygiene-services company on behalf of Invesco Perpetual Ltd.  Rentokil  fell  6.9 percent, the steepest decline since March
2009, to 104.5 pence at the close in London. The disposal could
raise as much as 209 million pounds ($335 million), according to
a person familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be
identified because the terms are private.  Invesco, Rentokil’s biggest shareholder, is reducing the
holding after its  fund manager , Neil Woodford, said on Oct. 15
that he was leaving the firm after 25 years. The U.K. hedge
fund’s  stake  totals about 25 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Shares in Rentokil, which has headquarters at
Gatwick Airport outside London, fell 2.9 percent after Woodford
announced his departure.  “Woodford’s leaving means there will be redemptions, and
they will sell some of their holdings,” said David Greenall, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC. “If the stock’s placed at
106, which it was, and it’s a big placing affecting 11 percent
of the company, then the shares are going to hover around that
kind of level.”  Deutsche Bank said in a statement that it will be the sole
manager in the sale. A spokesman for Rentokil Initial declined
to comment on the share sale.  Trading volume in Rentokil shares were about seven times
the three-month daily average. The stock has gained 9 percent
this year, valuing Rentokil at 1.9 billion pounds. Today’s
decline was the biggest on the FTSE 250 Index.  Of 21 analysts who follow Rentokil and share their findings
with Bloomberg, 10 recommend holding the stock, six suggest
selling and five advise buying. The average 12-month stock-price
projection is 101.79 pence, based on 14 estimates, implying a
potential decrease of about 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
