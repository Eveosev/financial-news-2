Ethanol declined a day after a
government report showed that production last week jumped to the
highest level in 16 months.  The additive’s discount to gasoline widened 0.09 cent to
84.97 cents a gallon a day after the Energy Information
Administration said production rose 1.6 percent to 911,000
barrels a day, the highest since June 8, 2012.  “Things are still tight, there’s no doubt about it, but
eventually this all works out,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “It’s a big
production rate and the trader’s job is to try to look ahead.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery fell 1.8 cents, or
1 percent, to $1.784 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures are down 19 percent this year.  Gasoline for November delivery sank 1.71 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.6337 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Implied demand for ethanol jumped to the highest this year,
according to data from Bloomberg Industries.  Stockpiles of the additive last week dropped 3.5 percent to
15 million barrels, an all-time low, data showed from the EIA,
the Energy Department’s analytical arm.  The U.S. hasn’t made any  foreign purchases  of the biofuel
since Sept. 27, the longest streak since May, according to EIA.  Blackford said he expects production levels to increase
from current levels and that the industry would have to increase
exports in order to buoy prices.  Ethanol Exports  A separate EIA  report  yesterday showed ethanol exports in
August, the most recent month data is available, jumped to
38,000 barrels a day, the highest since March.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. Farmers have
 harvested  59 percent of crops as of Oct. 27, compared to 39
percent a week earlier, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on
Oct. 28.  Corn for December delivery slipped 2 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $4.2825 a bushel in  Chicago . The December crush spread of
corn to ethanol was 10 cents, down from 11 cents yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  RINs, certificates attached to each gallon of  corn-based 
ethanol that are submitted to the government and can be traded
among companies, gained 2 cents to 25 cents a gallon. Advanced
RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, rose 3 cents to 32 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast dropped 7
cents to $2.005 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Prices in the U.S. Gulf rose 3.5 cents, also reaching $2.005,
while in Chicago the additive lost 6.5 cents to $1.825, and in
 New York  the biofuel gained 5 cents to $2.055 a gallon.  Chicago’s discount to New York widened 10.5 cents to 23
cents, while the West Coast traded at parity to the Gulf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
