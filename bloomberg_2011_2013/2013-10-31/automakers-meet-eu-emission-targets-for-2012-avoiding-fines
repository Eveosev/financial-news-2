The European Union said no car
manufacturer is likely to face EU fines for its carbon-dioxide
emissions in 2012, the first year in which caps took effect.  The European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, said
automobile makers ranging from  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  to  General Motors
Co. (GM)  either met their targets last year, including by exercising
the right to form pools among producers, or have possible
derogations that would permit an overshooting.  The EU decided in 2008 to phase in caps on CO2 from autos
as of 2012 to help fight climate change, imposing emission curbs
on 65 percent of the new fleet last year, 75 percent in 2013, 80
percent in 2014 and 100 percent beginning in 2015. The
legislation, backed by penalties, aims to cut average car CO2
emissions to 130 grams a kilometer in 2015 through varying
targets for individual manufacturers.  “All the main carmakers have met their 2012 targets,”
Isaac Valero-Ladron, the commission’s climate-policy spokesman,
said today by e-mail from Brussels. “Carmakers’ rate of
progress indicates that future objectives are certainly
attainable. Targets work.”  The commission published today in the EU’s  Official Journal 
the 2012 CO2 performance of automakers under the legislation.
The data come as EU lawmakers negotiate over a proposed average
car-emissions cap in 2020 of 95 grams of CO2 a kilometer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
