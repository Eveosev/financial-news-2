Colorado Avalanche goaltender Semyon Varlamov was arrested on charges of domestic violence and
kidnapping, according to the Denver Police Department.  Varlamov, a 25-year-old from  Russia , turned himself in
yesterday evening and was being held without bond on a charge of
second-degree kidnapping, a felony, and third-degree assault, a
misdemeanor, Denver Police Sergeant Steve Warneke said in a
telephone interview.  Varlamov was being held in the Downtown Detention Center
and had a 10 a.m. local time appearance scheduled in Denver
District Court, according to the Denver Sheriff Department
website. Police would offer no details of the alleged incident.  “The Colorado Avalanche organization is aware of the
allegations concerning Semyon Varlamov,” the National Hockey
League team said in a statement on its website. “At this time,
and until the conclusion of this investigation, the Avalanche
organization will have no further comment on this situation.”  Paul Theofanous, Varlamov’s agent, said in an e-mail that
his client “is completely innocent of all of these charges.”  Varlamov is also a candidate for the Russian hockey team
for the Winter Olympics in Sochi, which begin Feb. 7.  Igor Ananskykh, head of Russia’s State Duma for Physical
Culture, Sport and Youth Affairs, called his arrest “an effort
to weaken our national team,”  according to The Voice of
Russia ’s website.  Varlamov, in his sixth NHL season, is 7-1 this year,
helping the Avalanche (10-1) to the Western Conference Central
Division lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
