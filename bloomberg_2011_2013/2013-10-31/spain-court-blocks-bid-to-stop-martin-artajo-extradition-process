Spain’s  Supreme Court  rejected a bid
by former  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  trader Javier Martin-Artajo to
thwart efforts to extradite him to the U.S.  Martin-Artajo’s lawyers had sought a ruling suspending a
cabinet decision allowing his extradition case to proceed to
court, arguing that under a 1985 law he couldn’t be sent abroad
because he’s a Spanish national. The Supreme Court rejected the
request and ordered the proceedings to continue, according to a
copy of the ruling sent by the tribunal by e-mail today.  The National Court in  Madrid  said on Oct. 29 it had
received papers requesting Martin-Artajo’s extradition to the
U.S. following the cabinet’s decision. Judge Santiago Pedraz has
ordered Martin-Artajo to court on Nov. 8 to ask him if he
consents to extradition as proceedings get under way.  Martin-Artajo turned himself in to police in August and was
released by the National Court pending an extradition request.
The Spanish citizen, who oversaw synthetic credit trading at
JPMorgan’s chief investment office in London, was indicted in
the U.S. last month for engaging in a  securities fraud  to hide
losses stemming from trades by Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman at the
center of the case who became known as the London Whale.  Martin-Artajo’s lawyer, Lista Cannon at Norton Rose
Fulbright LLP in London, wasn’t immediately available to comment
when contacted by phone and e-mail by  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
