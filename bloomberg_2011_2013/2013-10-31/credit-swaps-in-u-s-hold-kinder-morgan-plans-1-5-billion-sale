A measure of U.S. company credit
risk held at about the highest in two weeks as business activity
in October recorded the biggest monthly increase in three
decades.  Kinder Morgan  Inc. issued $1.5 billion in notes.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps gauge that investors use to hedge against
losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 0.1 basis
point to 72.9 basis points at 5:12 p.m. in  New York , according
to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The measure ended yesterday at
73 basis points, the highest since Oct. 16.  The MNI Chicago Report business barometer jumped the most
this month since July 1983, after the Fed fueled bets yesterday
that it may begin to cut stimulus in the coming months. The
central bank maintained $85 billion in monthly bond purchases,
saying that while the economy shows signs of “underlying
strength” it needs to see more evidence of sustainable
improvement.  “With the Fed yesterday, everything ramped up and now it’s
the usual buy the rumor, sell the fact,” Matthew Duch, who
helps oversee $12 billion as a  money manager  at Bethesda,
Maryland-based Calvert Investments Inc., said in a telephone
interview. “Credits are pretty stable because they can find
liquidity now. There’s a tremendous amount of money being put to
work out there.”  The gauge of business activity increased to 65.9 from 55.7
in September, to the index’s highest reading since March 2011.
Readings above 50 signal expansion. The measure exceeded the
most optimistic estimate in a Bloomberg survey, in which the
median projection was 55.  Kinder Morgan  The swaps index typically falls as investor confidence
improves and climbs as it deteriorates. Credit swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Kinder Morgan, a Houston-based pipeline operator, issued
equal $750 million portions of 5 percent notes due February 2021
that yield 306.1 basis points more than Treasuries and 5.625
percent bonds maturing November 2023 that yield an extra 307.3,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sale was boosted
from an earlier estimate of $1 billion. The debt is rated Ba2 at
Moody’s Investors Service, Bloomberg data show.  Santander UK Plc, a unit of Spanish lender  Banco Santander
SA (SAN) , sold $1.5 billion of 5 percent, 10-year subordinated notes
that yield 250 basis points more than Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show.  The  risk premium  on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, a credit-swaps benchmark tied to speculative-grade
bonds, decreased 0.8 basis point to 353.9 basis points,
Bloomberg prices show.  The average extra yield investors demand to hold dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate bonds rather than
similar-maturity Treasuries rose 0.2 basis point to 124.7 basis
points, Bloomberg data show.  Investment-grade debt is rated Baa3 or higher at Moody’s
and at least BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
