Allen Iverson retired as a member of
the Philadelphia 76ers of the  National Basketball Association ,
nearly four years after playing his last game.  “I’m going to always be a Sixer ’til I die,” Iverson, 38,
said during a news conference at the Wells Fargo Center.  His No. 3 will be retired March 1 in the 76ers’ game
against the  Washington Wizards .  During his 14-year career with Philadelphia, Denver,
 Detroit  and Memphis, Iverson amassed 24,368 points to rank 19th
on the league’s career scoring list.  “I thought that once this day came, it would be basically
a tragic day,” Iverson said. “I never imagined the day coming,
but I knew it would come. I feel proud and happy to say that I’m
happy with my decision and I feel great.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
