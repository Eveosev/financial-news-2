Centar, a company founded by former
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  merger adviser Ian Hannam, has won
regulatory permission to mine in  Zimbabwe  in a venture with
Meikles Ltd.  Approval from the Competition and Tariff Commission was
received this month, Andrew Lane-Mitchell, company secretary for
Harare-based Meikles said in a written response to questions.
The venture will be established by the end of March, he said.  “The two mining ventures will be concluded by the end of
the group’s financial year end,” Lane-Mitchell said. “At this
stage we cannot comment any further,” he said, without
specifying what the company will be mining.  Centar, based in Guernsey, was founded in 2011 to mine gold
in  Afghanistan . Hannam, who advised on the combination of
 Xstrata Plc (GLEN)  and Glencore International Plc, left JPMorgan last
year.  Hannam, JPMorgan’s chairman of equity capital markets,
stepped down in April 2012 to appeal a decision by the U.K.’s
Financial Services Authority to fine him 450,000 pounds
($721,000) for market abuse. He e-mailed a potential customer in
2008 with details of a bid for his client Heritage Oil Plc, as
well as news of an oil find, the FSA said. Hannam said in a
statement at the time that he would appeal and planned to
continue his financial career after the dispute was over.  Zimbabwe has the world’s second-biggest reserves of
platinum and chrome as well as deposits of coal, gold, iron ore
and nickel.  Meikles runs hotels and supermarkets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
