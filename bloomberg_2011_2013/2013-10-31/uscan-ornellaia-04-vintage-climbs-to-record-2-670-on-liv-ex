Twelve bottles from the 2004 vintage
of Tuscan estate Ornellaia sold on Liv-ex in  London  for a record
1,660 pounds ($2,670) this month as investors diversified away
from  Bordeaux  into regions such as northern  Italy  and the Rhone.  The trade on Oct. 2 was 2.5 percent up from 1,620 pounds
paid for two half-cases in late September and was followed by
six bottles selling for the equivalent of 1,640 pounds a case on
Oct. 21, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  Ornellaia now regularly sells for more than $2,000 a case
as demand at auction for wines from Italy, Burgundy and
 California  has picked up in recent months and appetite has eased
from Asian collectors for top Bordeaux. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50
Index, a Bordeaux benchmark, has fallen more than 5 percent
since the end of March.  Top Tuscan wines, along with Champagne and Burgundy,
“haven’t been subject to the ups and downs of the more
speculative investor market we’ve seen in Bordeaux,”  Miles Davis , partner of London-based Wine Asset Managers LLP, said in
an interview. “They have been much steadier investments.” The
fund has $20 million under management.  This month’s high is 34 percent above the level of 1,240
pounds a case at which 18 bottles traded on Liv-ex in November
2010, and almost triple the 560 pounds a case at which 60
bottles sold in April 2007, according to Cellar Watch data.  Tuscan Coast  The Ornellaia Estate was set up in 1981 outside the village
of Bolgheri, close to the Tuscan coast west of Florence. Planted
with vines the following year, its first vintage was in 1985.
Known for Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux-style grapes, it
also produces a single-vineyard premium Merlot, Masseto, which
is sold separately through French merchants.  A case of Ornellaia 2004 sold for $3,369 at a  Sotheby’s (BID) 
auction in  New York  on Sept. 21, beating its pre-sale estimate.
Earlier in the year a case of the same vintage sold for $2,214
at  Acker Merrall & Condit  in New York on May 22, while six
bottles of Ornellaia 2005 fetched 1,112 Swiss francs ($1,240) at
Christie’s International Plc in Geneva in May, the equivalent of
$2,480 for a full case, according to data on the auction houses’
websites. On July 27, a case spanning six vintages back to 1993
fetched 1,547 pounds at Bonhams in London.  “If you look at auctions, there seems to be much more
diversity” compared with the traditional Bordeaux focus, said
Stephen Mould, head of Sotheby’s European wine department.
“There’s definitely been a shift in dynamic.”  Cabernet Sauvignon  The flagship brand from the main estate, Ornellaia Bolgheri
DOC Rosso, is made from Bordeaux grapes  Cabernet Sauvignon ,
Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, under the direction of
winemaker Axel Heinz.  The winery has been marketing the 2010 vintage, a quarter-century after its first, and marked the occasion with a charity
auction held by Sotheby’s at London’s Royal Opera House in May.  That sale raised 238,500 pounds from bids on large-format
bottles incorporating designs by artist Michelangelo Pistoletto,
and followed a similar auction held in New York in February
which raised $55,250.  Since 1997, it has also produced a second wine, Le Serre
Nuove dell’Ornellaia, using grapes selected out of the main
wine, and now also makes Le Volte dell’Ornellaia, blending 50
percent Merlot and 20 percent Cabernet Sauvignon with 30 percent
native Italian Sangiovese.  Its vineyards cover 99 hectares (245 acres). According to
Ornellaia’s  website , Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot vines cover
38 hectares each, with Cabernet Franc on 12 hectares and Petit
Verdot on 7. There are also smaller quantities of white
Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Petit Manseng.  Ornellaia was founded in 1981 by Lodovico Antinori.
Bordeaux-based wine consultant Michel Rolland began his
association with the vineyard in 1991 and it has been owned
since 2005 by Tuscan wine group  Marchesi de’ Frescobaldi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
