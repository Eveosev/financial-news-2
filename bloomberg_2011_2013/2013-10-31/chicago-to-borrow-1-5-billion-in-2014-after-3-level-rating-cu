Chicago  plans to issue at least $1.5
billion in municipal debt next year, offering the securities
with a Moody’s Investors Service rating three levels lower than
when it sold bonds in 2012.  The third-most-populous U.S. city expects to pay an extra
$1 million annually for each $100 million of general-obligation
bonds because of the Moody’s rating cut, according to Kelley
Quinn, a spokeswoman for Mayor  Rahm Emanuel . The New York-based
company dropped its rank in July to A3, the fourth-lowest
investment grade, citing pension burdens and the costs of crime.  Emanuel, a 53-year-old Democrat, last week proposed raising
the city cigarette tax by 75 cents to help close a deficit of
$339 million. Its annual pension obligation would jump from $467
million in 2014 to $1.2 billion a year later if state lawmakers
don’t restructure the retirement system, according to Moody’s.
The Chicago pension funds were created by the state, and
changing them requires legislative approval.  The cost of fighting crime has added to Chicago’s fiscal
stress. Chicago recorded 506 homicides in 2012, the most in four
years. The city cut its homicide rate this year by 18 percent
through Oct. 20, partly by paying 400 officers overtime to
police crime-ridden neighborhoods.  The extra yield that investors demand to own tax-exempt
Chicago general obligations due in January 2033 rose to 1.67
percentage points above benchmark munis yesterday, close to the
highest in a month, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chicago has about $8.2 billion in general-obligation and
sales-tax bonds outstanding, according to Moody’s, which has a
negative outlook on the city’s credit rating. A portion of the
$1.5 billion of bonds will refinance some of that, Quinn said.  Editors:  To contact the reporters on this story:
