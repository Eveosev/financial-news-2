Gasoline retreated after a report
that an East Coast refinery restarted a production unit.  Futures fell from a seven-day high after Delta Air Lines
Inc.’s Monroe Energy LLC subsidiary said it is operating the
fluid catalytic cracker at its Trainer,  Pennsylvania , refinery
after unplanned repairs. The 185,000-barrel-a-day plant serves
the Central Atlantic, which includes the  New York  Harbor
delivery point for Nymex product futures.  “These refinery issues aren’t as bad as people thought
they would be,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gasoline for November delivery fell 2.83 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.6225 a gallon at 10:33 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 35 percent below the
100-day average for the time of day.  The more actively traded December contract fell 2.64 cents,
or 1 percent, to $2.5906 a gallon. November gasoline and diesel
contracts will expire at the end of floor trading today.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 90 cents to $12.43 a barrel. The
fuel’s  spread  versus Brent slipped 44 cents to a 19-cent
discount.  U.S. retail  pump prices , averaged nationwide, were
unchanged at $3.279 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said
today on its website. Prices are 24.9 cents below a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery fell 1.63
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.9623 a gallon on trading volume
