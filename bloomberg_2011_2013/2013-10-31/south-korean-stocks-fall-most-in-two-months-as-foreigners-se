South Korean stocks fell, sending
the benchmark  index  to its biggest loss in two months, as
foreign investors cut holdings for the first time in 45 days
amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  may soon pare stimulus.  The Kospi gauge retreated 1.4 percent to 2,030.09 at the
close in  Seoul , the biggest loss since Aug. 20.  Korean Air Lines
Co. (003490)  sank 11 percent, the most in two years, after saying its
shipping affiliate has a “temporary” liquidity shortage.
 Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. (011200)  declined 7.7 percent, while Naver
Corp. dropped 5.2 percent.  International investors snapped a record stretch of inflows
into Asia’s fourth-largest stock market, selling a net $80
million of shares as of 3:28 p.m. in Seoul, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Economists at Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc
said yesterday’s Fed policy statement left open the possibility
of reduced bond purchases as soon as December.  “Selling of South Korean stocks by foreigners after a
record streak of purchases seems to have had negative impact on
the market,” said Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based  money manager  at
Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees about
$28 billion. “Foreigners had held up the Kospi.”  International ownership of Kospi index companies climbed to
more than 35 percent of outstanding shares this month, the
highest level since July 2007, according to data from the
Financial Supervisory Service. They purchased $4.8 billion in
October through yesterday, lured by the fastest economic growth
in two years, the nation’s strengthening currency and its
current-account surplus.  The Kospi reached a two-year high yesterday and has climbed
1.7 percent in October, its fourth-straight monthly gain. The
gauge is up 1.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
