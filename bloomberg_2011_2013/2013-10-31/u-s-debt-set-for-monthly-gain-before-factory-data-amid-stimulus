Treasury 10-year note yields touched
the highest level in more than a week after business activity
expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years, adding to
speculation the Federal Reserve’s stimulus is working.  The benchmark  securities  trimmed their first back-to-back
monthly advance since April. Yields rose yesterday as Fed policy
makers said the economy showed signs of “underlying strength”
even as they continue the $85 billion in monthly bond purchases,
known as quantitative easing. They next meet Dec. 17-18. The MNI
 Chicago Report (CHPMINDX)  business barometer jumped a day before the
Institute for Supply Management releases its factory gauge,
which rose to a two-year high last month.  “The little less-dovish Fed and the PMI resulted in a
little higher rates,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate
strategist in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “People had been
looking to the 2.40s on 10s, and it’s just not there yet.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.55 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices showed, after touching 2.57
percent, the highest since Oct. 22. It earlier fell four basis
points to 2.50 percent. The 2.5 percent note maturing in August
2023 dropped 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 17/32.  Ten-year note  yields  have fallen six basis points this
month after sliding 17 basis points in September.  Dealer Holdings  Primary dealers reduced their  holdings  of Treasuries by the
most in 14 months for the five-day period ended Oct. 23,
according to Bloomberg data. The dealers cut their holdings by
$37.7 billion, or 26 percent, to $108.3 billion, the biggest
reduction since the period ended Aug. 1, 2012.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, rose to $403 billion, the
highest level since Oct. 10. Volume reached a 2013 high of $662
billion on May 22 and a low of $147.8 billion on Aug. 9.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the MOVE index rose
to 61.68. It touched 58.54 on Oct. 28, the lowest level since
May. It climbed on Sept. 5 to 114.2, the highest level in two
months. It touched a record low 49 on May 9.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 48.4 today, from 43.4 yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data. It closed at 31.3 on Oct. 29. A
reading lower than 30 or above 70 suggests the security may be
poised for a change in direction.  Benchmark Indexes  The rise in yields today may have been limited by month-end
buying. Funds that manage portfolios against benchmark indexes,
including the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, typically buy
longer-maturity Treasuries near month-end to align the interest-rate sensitivity of their holdings with the indexes.  The Barclays index, which many funds use to measure their
performance, will extend its duration, the measure of rate-sensitivity, by 0.08 year on Nov. 1, compared with 0.10 year in
October.  Treasuries have gained 0.5 percent this month, cutting
their decline this year to 1.9 percent, according to Bloomberg
World Bond Indexes. They have jumped 1.7 percent since Sept. 17,
the day before the Federal Open Market Committee unexpectedly
refrained from reducing stimulus, saying it needed more evidence
of lasting improvement in the economy.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is pushing unprecedented
accommodation into the final months of his tenure as he seeks to
shield the four-year economic expansion from the impact of
higher borrowing costs and the government shutdown. The closure
resulted in the furlough of as many as 800,000 federal workers
and delayed release of data the Fed says it needs to evaluate
the economy.  March Taper  “Growth is going to be slow for the next six months so
they will not have an opportunity to taper,” said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasury trading in New York at primary dealer
 Bank of Nova Scotia. (BNS)  “It’s going to be more difficult for them
to get out” of the program.  The Fed’s  monthly purchases  will remain divided between $40
billion a month of mortgage bonds and $45 billion in Treasury
securities. The central bank purchased $927 million in
securities maturing between November 2024 and May 2030 today as
part of the program. A Bloomberg survey of analysts taken on
Oct. 17-18 forecast a March taper.  Treasury yields climbed after the MNI Chicago Report
business barometer rose to 65.9 in October from 55.7 a month
earlier, the fastest pace since March 2011. Readings above 50
signal expansion. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of
economists was 55. The index averaged 54.6 in 2012 and 62.8 in
2011.  Notes Auctions  “The Chicago PMI was meaningfully better than expected,”
said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist in New York at
broker-dealer BTIG LLC. “We seem to be settling into the 2.5-to-2.55 percent level. As the year progresses, the bias may be a
touch to the upside in yields.”  Jobless claims  decreased by 10,000 to 340,000 in the week
ended Oct. 26 from 350,000 the prior period, the Labor
Department reported in  Washington . The median forecast of 49
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a decrease to
338,000.  The Institute for Supply Management  factory gauge  was at 55
in October, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, compared with 56.2 last month, which
was the highest since April 2011. Readings greater than 50
signal growth.  The Treasury auctioned two-, five- and seven-year notes
this week at the highest demand in six months as the Fed
maintained its bond-buying program.  Investors bid $2.88 for every dollar of the $96 billion in
debt sold, the highest since similar sales of the maturities in
April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bid-to-cover
ratio was 2.85 for all sales of U.S. coupon securities in
October, the highest since May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
