Three  federal home loan banks 
dropped their opposition to  Bank of America Corp .’s $8.5 billion
settlement in a  New York  state court lawsuit over Countrywide
residential mortgage backed securities.  Lawyers for the Federal Home Loan Banks of  Boston , Chicago
and Indianapolis yesterday told New York Supreme Court Judge
Barbara Kapnick they are withdrawing from the case.  Also yesterday, lawyers for Cranberry Park LLC and
Cranberry Park LLC II, funds which in August said they owned
Countrywide securities with an original principal value of more
than $1 billion, asked the judge for permission to withdraw
their previous objection to the settlement.  The settlement between  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , as
trustee for the securities, and Bank of America’s Countrywide,
resolves claims the mortgage lender breached its contractual
obligation to repurchase delinquent mortgages that were pooled
for the securities.  Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment on the 
filings.  The case is In the matter of the application of the Bank of
New York Mellon, 651786-2011, New York State Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
