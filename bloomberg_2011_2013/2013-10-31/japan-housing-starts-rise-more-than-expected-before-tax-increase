Japan ’s  housing starts  rose for a
13th month in September, the longest streak since the period
ended February 1994, ahead of the government’s planned
consumption tax increase next year.  Construction companies broke ground on 19.4 percent more
homes last month than a year earlier, according to a report
released today by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism in Tokyo. Housing starts were expected to
rise 12 percent, based on the median  estimate  of 24 economists
in a  Bloomberg News survey .  Demand for homes is increasing as the government plans to
raise the  sales tax  to 8 percent from 5 percent next April and
amid concerns that  interest rates  will start to rise as the
central bank moves to stem deflation.  Daiwa House Industry Co. (1925) 
and  Sekisui House Ltd. (1928) , Japan’s two-biggest homebuilders, have
forecast better-than-expected earnings citing strong orders.  Housing starts  rose to an annualized 1.04 million units in
September, the highest since September 2008, the report showed.
They were expected to rise to 983,000 units, according to the
median estimate of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Daiwa House said on Sept. 24 it will report a high-than-forecast profit of 73 billion yen ($742 million) for the year
ending March 2014. Sekisui House on Sept. 5 raised its net
income forecast by 22 percent to 77 billion yen for the year
ending January 2014. Orders gained 16 percent for the first six
months from a year earlier, the company said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
