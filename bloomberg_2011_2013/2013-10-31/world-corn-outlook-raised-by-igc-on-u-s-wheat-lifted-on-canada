World corn production will be more
than predicted last month as the forecast for the U.S. was
raised, while wheat output will be higher on  Canada , the
International Grains Council said.  Farmers across the world will harvest a record crop of
948.4 million metric tons of corn in the 2013-14 season begun
July 1, up 5.2 million tons from a Sept. 26 forecast, the
London-based council wrote in a report today. Thatâ€™s up from
862.7 million tons in the previous season.  The global harvest of wheat may jump to 696.4 million tons
from 654.9 million tons a year earlier, it said. The forecast
was raised from the previous month by 3.8 million tons as
production in Canada will be more than the council estimated a
month ago.  Wheat futures slipped 1 percent in  Chicago  this month after
rising 3.8 percent in September on concern adverse weather may
curb production in the Black Sea region and  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
