Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  reported third-quarter profit that missed analysts’ expectations as revenue
declined 3.6 percent.  Earnings excluding some costs and gains fell to $165
million, or 9 cents a share, from $173 million, or 9 cents, a
year earlier, Montreal-based Bombardier said today in a
statement. That missed the  10-cent average  of 21 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue dropped to $4.06 billion from
$4.21 billion.  Bombardier, based in Montreal, is striving to ready its
biggest plane ever, the CSeries jetliner, for entry into service
next year after being delayed three times. The company
successfully completed the plane’s first flight last month and
raised the program cost estimate to $3.9 billion.  Bombardier’s widely traded Class B  shares  fell 0.8 percent
to C$5.28 in Toronto yesterday. That cut their gain this year to
40 percent, compared with a 8.2 percent climb for  Canada ’s
benchmark Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
