Boeing Co. (BA)  plans to speed the
monthly production tempo of its best-selling 737 jets by 24
percent to 47 a month by 2017, the highest rate ever for the
world’s largest planemaker.  Boeing, based in Chicago, is on a production tear. Last
week, the company announced plans to speed production of its 787
Dreamliner to 14 a month by the end of the decade. The 737
program announced today will build more than 560 of its narrow-body jetliner a year, increasing output by about 50 percent
since 2010. It’s also ramped up production on the wide-bodied
777.  The faster production tempo will help Boeing more quickly
reap the cash benefits of a large backlog of jet orders. The
planemaker currently has more than 3,400 unfilled orders for 737
models that include its Next Generation series and the new Max
variants expected to debut by 2017.  “We’re taking this step to make sure our airplanes get
into the hands of our customers when they need them,” Beverly
Wyse, a Boeing vice president and general manager of the 737
program, said in a statement.  Boeing said it currently builds 737s at rate of 38 planes a
month at its factory in Renton,  Washington , and is in the
process of increasing production to 42 a  month by the first
half of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
