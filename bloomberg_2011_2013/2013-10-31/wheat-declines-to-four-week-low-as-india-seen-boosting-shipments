Wheat futures dropped to a five-week
low on speculation that exports will increase from  India , the
world’s second-largest grower. Corn and soybeans also declined
as rains aid crops in South America.  India’s cabinet approved a cut in the minimum price for
sales of state reserves to $260 a metric ton from $300, to
reduce inventories that are more than double normal needs, Food
Minister K.V. Thomas said yesterday. State stockpiles totaled
36.1 million tons at the start of this month.  Chicago  wheat
futures are down 14 percent this year, and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture is predicting global  output   will rise 8.2
percent to a record. The U.S. is the largest exporter.  “With India now back looking to sell wheat, that will take
a toll on sales by other exporters, including the U.S.,” Jim Gerlach, president of A/C Trading Co. in Fowler,  Indiana , said
in a telephone interview. “World wheat supplies will be
adequate.”  Wheat futures for delivery in December fell 1.1 percent to
close at $6.675 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $6.67, the lowest since Sept. 25. The
most-active contract dropped 1.6 percent in October after
gaining 3.7 percent last month.  Prices also fell on speculation that  rain  this week may aid
development of crops in the U.S. Great Plains and Midwest before
going dormant in December, Gerlach said. The USDA estimates 86
percent of the winter-wheat crop was planted on Oct. 27, and 61
percent was  rated  in good or excellent condition, up from 40
percent a year earlier.  Corn and soybeans fell on speculation that rain this week
in Argentina will help ease drought conditions and accelerate
planting, Gerlach said. Wet, warm weather is aiding early crop
growth in  Brazil , where farmers are planting, he said.  Corn futures for delivery in December slid 0.5 percent to
$4.2825 a bushel in Chicago. The grain fell 3 percent this month
and earlier today touched $4.27, the lowest since August 2010.  Soybean futures for delivery in January fell 0.8 percent to
$12.6625 a bushel on the CBOT, capping a second straight monthly
decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
