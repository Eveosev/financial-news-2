Starwood Property Trust Inc. (STWD)  said it
will spin off its single-family rental-home unit into a real
estate investment trust headed by Waypoint Real Estate Group’s
management division, which is being acquired in the deal.  The spinoff, Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust, held $750
million in 4,268 homes and non-performing loans on 1,549
properties as of Sept. 30, Starwood Property said in a statement
today. The new REIT will receive $100 million in cash from its
parent, a $400 million line of credit and no debt, which will
position it to be the second-largest publicly traded single-family rental REIT by portfolio value, according to Starwood
Property Chairman  Barry Sternlicht .  “We’re buying $50 million to $60 million homes a month and
the baby is getting a little large -- like Moby-Dick,”
Sternlicht said in a telephone interview today. “With Waypoint,
we’ll have best-in-class management that has capability proven
to get to scale.”  Wall Street-backed investors have been racing to buy houses
as  prices , which fell as much as 35 percent from their 2006
peak, are rising at their fastest pace in seven years. Demand
for rental homes is growing from millions of households that
went through  foreclosure  or can’t qualify for a mortgage.  Sternlicht, 52, will be chairman of the new company, which
he expects to begin trading publicly on the  New York  Stock
Exchange under the ticker SWAY in February. Gary Beasley and
Doug Brien, Waypoint’s current co-chief executive officers, will
serve as co-CEOs of the new company.  Sternlicht, whose Greenwich, Connecticut-based Starwood
Capital Group has $26.3 billion under management, began
investing in distressed real estate after the 1980s savings-and-loan crisis. Starwood Property is a REIT managed by a Starwood
Capital affiliate.  Starwood’s Strength  Waypoint, an Oakland, California-based landlord with about
5,000 properties, filed for an initial public offering as a REIT
in May, just as investor interest in housing-related stocks
suffered following a spike in  mortgage rates . The new company is
a way for Waypoint to go public using Starwood’s strength as a
source for capital, Beasley said.  “We’ve always wanted to find a way to build a big
platform,” he said in a telephone interview. “Really, the only
thing that’s been missing for us is capital.”  Beasley and Sternlicht declined to say how much Starwood
paid for Waypoint.  Shares of three publicly traded single-family rental REITs
-- American Homes 4 Rent, the largest publicly traded house REIT
with 20,000 homes, American Residential Properties Inc. and
Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. -- are trading below their initial
prices.  Market ‘Wrong’  “Our bet here is that the public market is wrong,”
Sternlicht said. “Long-term we can create in-scale, lasting
assets in the public market that will pay a current yield higher
than those of other REITs and will have home price appreciation
at least equivalent to that in other commercial real estate.”  Private-equity firms,  hedge funds  and REITs have raised
more than $20 billion in the past two years to acquire as many
as 200,000 rental homes.  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the largest
landlord with about $7.5 billion spent on 40,000 houses, started
shopping the first-ever U.S. bonds backed by rental homes to
investors this week.  Waypoint started in 2009 as one of the first investors in
single-family homes, developing software and management
attractive to Starwood. Waypoint will continue to manage its
properties, which are owned by 11 different funds, after the
acquisition, Beasley said.  Waypoint has “techno wizards” who have developed systems
to value properties being considered for acquisition and manage
them more efficiently than Starwood’s current set-up, which
relies on outside companies, Sternlicht said.  “I knew to go to  Florida  and I knew more or less where we
wanted to go,” Sternlicht said. Waypoint “can tell me what
street I should buy in  Orlando .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
