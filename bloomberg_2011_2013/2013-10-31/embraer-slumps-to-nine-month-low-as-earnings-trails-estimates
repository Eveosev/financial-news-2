Embraer SA (EMBR3)  fell to a nine-month low
after the Brazilian planemaker posted quarterly earnings that
trailed analysts’ estimates as jet deliveries declined.  The shares  tumbled  4.8 percent to 15.70 reais at 12:44 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo . A close at that level would be the lowest since
Jan. 23. It was the worst performance on the MSCI
Brazil/Industrials index, which  dropped  1.4 percent.  “The low number of deliveries of commercial aircraft is
still reflecting last year’s poor backlog impacted by worries
about global macroeconomic conditions,”  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) 
analysts led by Edigimar Maximiliano Jr. wrote in a research
note to clients today.  Embraer’s adjusted net income fell 57 percent to 81.2
million reais ($36.7 million) in the third quarter from a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg after the
company released results today. That compares with an average
estimate of 171.2 million reais among 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The company delivered 19 commercial jets, compared
with 27 in the prior period, according to the filing.  The  Sao Jose dos Campos , Brazil-based planemaker has
slumped 13 percent in the past week as  JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU) 
delayed the delivery of 24 Embraer jets to trim expenses.
Embraer’s backlog reached $17.8 billion in the third quarter,
the highest level since 2009, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
