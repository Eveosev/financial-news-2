Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
6.9 percent to the lowest level in more than three months,
according to a unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Onshore supplies including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen dropped by 1.4 million barrels to
19.2 million in the week to yesterday,  International Enterprise 
Singapore said in an e-mailed statement today. Stockpiles
declined for a fourth week to the least since the seven days
ended July 17.  Middle-distillate inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene rose by 95,000 barrels, or 1.1 percent, to 9.1
million, according to the data. Supplies rebounded from an
eight-week low.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha,
reformate and gasoline climbed by 395,000 barrels, or 3.9
percent, to 10.5 million, the data show. That’s the third weekly
gain in four.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
