The Canadian dollar extended gains
after a report showed the nationâ€™s economy expanded more than
forecast in August.  The currency strengthened from a seven-week low versus its
U.S. counterpart as the Federal Reserve maintained its $85
billion in monthly bond purchases yesterday, while leaving open
the possibility for future reductions by saying economic growth
persists. The Canadian economy  grew  0.3 percent in August,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, topping forecasts for a
0.1 percent gain.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, rose 0.4 percent to C$1.0438
per U.S. dollar at 8:34 a.m. in Toronto. Yesterday it touched
C$1.0497 per U.S. dollar, the weakest since Sept. 5. One loonie
buys 95.80 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
