Korean Air Lines Co. (003490)  dropped the
most in two years in  Seoul  trading on concerns the company may
provide further funding to its affiliate Hanjin Shipping Co.  South Korea ’s biggest carrier fell as much as 9.9 percent,
the most since September 2011, to 34,600 won and traded at
34,750 won as of 12:13 p.m. in Seoul. The stock is the worst
performer on MSCI Asia Pacific Index today. Hanjin Shipping
gained 1.9 percent to 7,960 won, after earlier surging as much
as 4 percent. The benchmark Kospi Index fell 0.7 percent.  Korean Air said yesterday it will provide 150 billion won
($142 million) to Hanjin Shipping to help ease the company’s
“temporary” liquidity shortage. Excess shipping capacity and a
slump in freight rates have caused shipping companies including
Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. and STX Pan Ocean Co. to lose money
in the first half of the year. The announcement came after
 Korean Air  last week posted a  loss  in the first nine months due
to weak  travel demand  on its Japan services.  “While it’s not a lot of money, the  airline industry  isn’t
doing all that well,” Um Kyung A, an analyst at Shinyoung
Securities Co. in Seoul, said by phone. “Korean Air also has a
lot of debt coming due next year.”  Korean Air is the biggest  shareholder  of Hanjin Shipping
Holdings Co., the holding company that owns the largest stake in
Hanjin Shipping Co. Both are members of Hanjin Group.  Hanjin Shipping is considering raising 300 billion won
through share sale and loans, Korea Economic Daily reported,
citing a company official it didn’t identify. The company is
considering a share sale and loans, said Sonya Cho, Hanjin
Shipping spokeswoman. Details haven’t been finalized, she said.  Korean Air Loss  The company has about 745.1 billion won in bonds and loans
maturing next year, compared with 47.7 billion won in 2013,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hanjin Shipping may post a loss in the third quarter,
typically the best period for shipping companies, Daishin
Securities Co. said in a Sept. 30 report. The company is
expected to announce its earnings as early as next week.  Korean Air lost 328.7 billion won in the January-September
period, compared with net income of 105 billion won a year
earlier. The airline last week finalized an order to buy 12
aircraft from Boeing Co. at a list price of $3.72 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
