The  Boston  Red Sox will celebrate
their third World Series title in 10 years with a parade
tomorrow through the city and then into the Charles River using
amphibious vehicles known as duck boats.  The Red Sox captured their eighth Major League Baseball
championship two nights ago at Bostonâ€™s Fenway Park with a 6-1
win against the St. Louis Cardinals. It was the first time in 95
years that the Red Sox, who won the best-of-seven series four
games to two, had clinched the World Series at home.  Boston finished last in the American League East a year
ago. The only other team to win a World Series title the year
after a last-place finish was the 1991 Minnesota Twins.  The parade will start near Fenway Park at 10 a.m. local
time. The  duck boats , which usually ferry tourists around the
city, will drive down Boylston Street, past Boston Common and
through the downtown area to the Museum of Science, where they
will go into the Charles for a celebratory lap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
