China’s stocks  fell, capping the
benchmark index’s first monthly loss since June, as  earnings (SHCOMP)  at
banks and consumer-staple producers disappointed investors.  China Minsheng Banking Corp. slid 2.4 percent after net
income trailed estimates. Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group
Co. and Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings Co. both
slumped by the daily 10 percent limit after posting earnings.
Poly Real Estate Group Co. led  property stocks  higher.  The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.9 percent to 2,141.61
at the close. The gauge slid 1.5 percent in October, taking its
annual decline to 5.6 percent. Earnings at the 252 companies in
the measure tracked by Bloomberg that reported results this
quarter have trailed analyst estimates by 6.1 percent.  “Earnings were generally worse than expected, which has
dampened sentiment,” said Zeng Xianzhao, an analyst at
Everbright Securities Co. in Chongqing.  The CSI 300 Index fell 1.4 percent to 2,373.72, while the
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  dropped 0.4 percent. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index gained 0.5 percent in  New York 
yesterday. The Shanghai index trades at 8.5 times projected
profits for the next 12 months, lower than the seven-year
average of 15.4.  China Minsheng Banking slid 0.22  yuan  to 8.96 yuan. The
company reported third-quarter net income of 10.4 billion yuan
($1.7 billion), trailing the 10.7 billion yuan estimate of
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Bad Loans  The nation’s top four  banks  posted their biggest increase
in soured loans since at least 2010. Nonperforming loans at
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (1398) , China Construction
Bank Corp., Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of China
Ltd. rose 3.5 percent in the three months to Sept. 30 from June
to a combined 329.4 billion yuan, Bloomberg data showed.  Money-market rates fell and  interest-rate swaps  retreated
from the highest level since June as the central bank added cash
to the financial system for the second time this week.  The People’s Bank of China conducted 16 billion yuan of 14-day reverse-repurchase contracts today at a yield of 4.3
percent, according to a trader at a primary dealer required to
bid at the auctions. That followed an injection of 13 billion
yuan via seven-day reverse repos at 4.1 percent on Oct. 29.
Commercial banks hoard cash toward month-end to meet liquidity
requirements set by the central bank and corporate tax payments
fell due in October, tying up funds.  Company Earnings  Gauges tracking consumer-staple producers and health-care
companies tumbled at least 2.4 percent.  Inner Mongolia Yili
Industrial (600887)  dropped 4.57 yuan to 41.13 yuan. The company’s third-quarter net income growth of 28.6 percent was below market
consensus of more than 60 percent, according to Ping An
Securities Co.  Baiyunshan fell 3.42 yuan to 30.82 yuan. Third-quarter net
income was 141 million yuan, compared with an estimate of at
least 200 million yuan at Capital Securities Corp.  “Health-care earnings are much lower than expected,
leading to the sector’s sell-off today,” said  Li Ying , an
analyst at Capital Securities.  A gauge of developers in the Shanghai index rose 0.2
percent. Poly Real Estate advanced 1.8 percent to 9.51 yuan, the
highest close since Oct. 23. Gemdale Corp. increased 1.7 percent
to 5.84 yuan.  A government statement yesterday, about an Oct. 29 study
session on housing by the ruling party’s decision-making
Politburo, didn’t mention  home prices , triggering speculation
policy makers won’t impose further property curbs, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
