New Zealand Post, the government-owned mail service, said it may reduce its workforce by almost a
fifth over the next three years to cut costs as letter volumes
slump.  Between 1,500 and 2,000 workers will lose their jobs, the
Wellington-based company said in a statement on its  website 
today. It employs 10,600 people currently. The company will also
reduce the frequency of letter delivery from 2015 and review its
ownership of retail outlets.  NZ Post is responding to a decline in letter volumes that
is projected to gather momentum, leaving it with excess capacity
in its network. The number of items mailed with NZ Post each
year is forecast to drop to less than 500 million within five
years from 770 million currently, it said.  “The postal business is rapidly heading into loss-making
territory,” the company said, adding that raising prices
wouldn’t be a sustainable solution.  The company will reduce urban letter delivery to not less
than three days a week from mid-2015, with five-day delivery in
rural areas, it said. An overnight priority service will be
offered.  A review of the company’s 139 retail stores will be
undertaken, with NZ Post saying it considers ownership of about
50 outlets to be appropriate. The remainder will be replaced by
agencies or self-service kiosks located within other retail
stores, it said.  NZ Post plans to increase its focus on parcel delivery,
reflecting forecast growth in volumes as more consumers shop
online. This includes deployment of more motorized delivery
vehicles replacing cycles, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
