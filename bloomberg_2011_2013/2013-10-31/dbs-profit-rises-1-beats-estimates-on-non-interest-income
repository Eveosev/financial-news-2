DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) ,  Southeast
Asia ’s largest lender, posted a 1 percent gain in third-quarter
profit on higher non-interest income.  Net income rose to S$862 million ($694 million) from S$856
million a year earlier for the quarter ended Sept. 30, the
Singapore-based lender said in a statement to the stock exchange
today. That beat the S$839 million  average  of seven analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Singaporean banks including DBS are looking for growth in
overseas markets including China and Indonesia as they combat
the lowest loan profitability in Southeast Asia. The lenders are
also expanding fee-generating businesses such as  wealth
management  at home and abroad.  “We expect fees and commissions, especially from wealth
management, to gain good traction and to continue to grow,” Ken Ang, a Singapore-based analyst at Phillip Securities Pte,  said
ahead of the results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
