Shui On Land Ltd. (272) , the developer
controlled by billionaire Vincent Lo, said  Brookfield Property
Partners (BPY)  agreed to invest $500 million into its China Xintiandi
entertainment complex unit.  Brookfield, a New York-based commercial real estate
operator, will invest into China Xintiandi in return for
convertible perpetual securities of $500 million and 415 million
warrants to be issued by Shui On exercisable at HK$2.85 per
share, according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Brookfield may invest as much as $250 million in addition within
24 months after the completion of the transaction, it said.  Shui On is seeking to pay down debt and improve its cash
position with the transaction, while using part of the proceeds
to fund the unit’s operations and future acquisitions, the
Shanghai-based developer said. Having Brookfield as a strategic
investor will also help bring China Xintiandi more opportunities
in the country’s commercial real estate market as well as better
financial management, according to the statement.  China Xintiandi developed projects including the Xintiandi
restaurant and bar district in  Shanghai . The name means New
Heaven and Earth in Chinese.  Shui On shares  jumped  as much as 4.1 percent before falling
0.7 percent to HK$2.67 as of 3:47 p.m. in Hong Kong.  The developer’s net income jumped 27 percent to 1.1 billion
 yuan  ($181 million) in the first half of this year from a year
earlier, the company said last month. Cash and bank deposits
rose 40 percent to 12.1 billion yuan as of June 30 from the end
of last year.  Shui On, which has been preparing for a share sale by the
unit, said in January it would spin off China Xintiandi to focus
on development.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
