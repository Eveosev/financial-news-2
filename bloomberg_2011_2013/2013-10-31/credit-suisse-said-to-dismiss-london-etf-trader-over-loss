Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Switzerland ’s
second-biggest bank, dismissed a  London  trader saying that he
lost $6 million on unauthorized transactions, according to a
person briefed on the situation.  Rohit Jha, who traded exchange-traded funds, was dismissed
on Oct. 28 and his supervisor, Matthew Tagliani, has been
suspended due to the losses, which occurred in December, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because personnel
matters are confidential. The Zurich-based bank notified
regulators promptly and has been cooperating with them, said
Jack Grone, a spokesman.  “No clients were impacted,” Grone said yesterday. “We
are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has
been contained.”  Jha and Tagliani didn’t reply to requests for comment sent
to their Credit Suisse e-mail addresses and the bank declined to
provide alternate contact details. Tagliani didn’t reply to a 
message sent to him through LinkedIn.  Grone declined to elaborate on the nature of the
unauthorized trade, which was first reported yesterday by the
Wall Street Journal. Jha joined Credit Suisse in 2009, U.K.
regulatory records show.  The loss amounts to a fraction of the Swiss company’s
profit. Credit Suisse’s investment bank took in about $30
million of revenue per day in the  third quarter , according to
its website.  UBS AG, Switzerland’s biggest bank, lost $2.3 billion on
unauthorized trades in 2011 by Kweku Adoboli, an ETF trader in
London. He was sentenced to seven years in jail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
