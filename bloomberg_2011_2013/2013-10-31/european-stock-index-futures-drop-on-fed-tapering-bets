European stocks  advanced to the
highest level in more than five years, with the Stoxx Europe 600
Index gaining for a second month, as better-than-estimated
earnings outweighed speculation the  Federal Reserve  may trim
bond purchases sooner than forecast.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  climbed 3.4 percent after posting an
unexpected increase in third-quarter net income. Alcatel-Lucent
surged the most in five years after reporting a narrower-than-forecast loss. Royal Dutch  Shell (RDSA)  Plc declined the most more than
two years after posting a 32 percent profit slump. Novo Nordisk
A/S slid 7.4 percent after earnings missed projections.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.5 percent to 322.37, its highest level
since May 22, 2008. The gauge rallied 3.8 percent in October,
its eighth monthly increase this year, as U.S. lawmakers
resolved a fiscal impasse.  “We have to keep an eye on Fed tapering,” Neil Veitch,
investment director at SVM Asset Management in Edinburgh, said.
“The rally in the last three to four years has been led by
unconventional monetary policy. That has obviously dominated the
investment landscape for a prolonged period of time. As a
consequence, many assets have become mis-priced. So as a
portfolio manager, it’s imperative you keep an eye on any
structural developments regarding quantitative easing.”  National benchmark indexes rose in 11 of the 18 western
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX advanced 0.3 percent to a
record, and  France ’s CAC 40 gained 0.6 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE
100 slid 0.7 percent.  Dropped Warning  The Federal Open Market Committee yesterday kept its
monthly bond purchases at $85 billion and said that while it
sees signs of strength in the  U.S. economy , it would wait for
more evidence of sustained improvement before slowing stimulus.
In a statement released after a two-day meeting, the FOMC
dropped its warning from last month that tighter financial
conditions could impair recovery.  The odds for the Fed to start reducing bond purchases in
January rose to 45 percent from 25 percent before the statement,
Citigroup Inc. said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Oct. 17-18
predicted the Fed would wait until March to begin the cuts.  A release today showed fewer Americans filed  first-time
applications  for jobless benefits last week. Economists in
another poll predict the  Institute for Supply Management  will
say tomorrow its  manufacturing index  fell in October.  In the euro area, the inflation rate unexpectedly dropped
in October, fueling speculation the  European Central Bank  will
cut  interest rates  to boost recovery. The ECB holds its next
policy meeting on Nov. 7.  BNP Paribas  BNP Paribas rose 3.4 percent to 54.54 euros after France’s
largest bank posted an unexpected increase in earnings as it set
aside fewer provisions for bad debts and pared costs. Net income
climbed to 1.36 billion euros ($1.85 billion) from 1.33 billion
euros a year earlier, beating the 1.19 billion-euro average
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Alcatel-Lucent surged 19 percent to 2.82 euros. The French
network-equipment maker said its third-quarter net loss fell to
200 million euros from a 316 million-euro loss a year earlier.
Analysts had predicted a 274 million-euro loss, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also said it will exceed
its full-year target for cost savings.  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV gained 2.8 percent to 76.60 euros.
The world’s biggest brewer said consolidated earnings before
interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization rose 10.5
percent in the three months through Sept. 30. The median
estimate of nine analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  had called
for growth of 5.7 percent.  Ingenico Guidance  Ingenico (ING)  advanced 5.6 percent to 55.46 euros, climbing the
most since September 2012. The provider of payment terminals and
services said  third-quarter revenue  rose to 348 million euros
from 311 million euros a year ago. The French company also
boosted its full-year forecasts.  Geberit AG rose 7.4 percent to 271.30 Swiss francs, a
record. The maker of toilets and pipes reported better-than-projected third-quarter profit and confirmed full-year
forecasts. Ebitda rose to 170.1 million francs ($188 million),
beating the 153.9 million-franc estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Shell declined 4.9 percent to 2,076.5 pence in  London , for
its largest retreat since August 2011. Europe’s biggest oil
company said third-quarter earnings dropped as refining gains
shrank and Nigerian output suffered disruption. Profit excluding
one-time items and inventory changes fell to $4.5 billion from
$6.6 billion a year earlier. That missed the $5.3 billion
average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Novo Nordisk dropped 7.4 percent to 914 kroner. The world’s
biggest insulin maker reported third-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates on slower-than-expected growth of its
Victoza diabetes treatment.  Croda International Plc lost 7.6 percent to 2,436 pence,
falling the most since December 2008. The second-biggest maker
of cosmetics ingredients said it expects fourth-quarter profit
to stagnate compared with the third quarter because of subdued
market conditions and weaker currencies.  Technip SA tumbled 10 percent to 77.15 euros, its sharpest
decline since December 2008.  Europe ’s largest oilfield-services
provider by market value reduced full-year targets after missing
estimates for third-quarter profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
