Panasonic Corp. (6752)  won a contract to
supply cells to  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) ’s electric vehicles in a deal
that may generate $7 billion in revenue.  The biggest supplier of lithium-ion batteries used in
electric cars will supply 2 billion lithium-ion battery cells to
the  Palo Alto , California-based automaker in the four years
through 2017, the Osaka-based company said in a statement
yesterday. That compares with about 200 million units shipped
for Tesla in the past two years, according to Chieko Gyobu, a
Panasonic spokeswoman.  The company is considering moving workers from personal
computer and mobile phone divisions into units developing
rechargeable batteries for cars and industrial uses, Megumi
Kitagawa, a Panasonic spokeswoman, said in a phone interview.
The Tesla contract to supply Model S and Model X vehicles may
add about $7 billion in sales and cement Panasonic’s position as
the largest supplier for electric cars, said Ali Izadi-Najafabadi, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst.  Panasonic shares  rose  3.5 percent to 982 yen, headed for
the highest close since July 2011, as of the midday break in
Tokyo trading, extending an 88 percent gain this year. That
compares with a 40 percent year-to-date rise for the benchmark
Topix index.  Tesla, led by billionaire Elon Musk, plans to sell 21,000
Model S sedans this year, priced from $70,000 to more than
$100,000. The Model X sport-utility vehicle is set to be offered
in late 2014.  Panasonic’s Gyobu declined to comment on battery revenue
from Tesla.  To contact the reporters on this story:
