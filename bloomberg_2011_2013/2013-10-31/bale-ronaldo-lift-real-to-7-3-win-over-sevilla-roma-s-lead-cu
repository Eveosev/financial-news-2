Gareth Bale scored twice in his
first home start for Real Madrid before Cristiano Ronaldo added
a hat trick in a 7-3 win against Sevilla in  Spain ’s La Liga.  Bale opened the scoring after 13 minutes at Real’s Bernabeu
stadium last night and doubled the lead 14 minutes later. The
Welsh forward then provided two assists as Ronaldo got three
goals and  Karim Benzema  netted twice.  Bale completed 90 minutes for the first time since joining
Real last month for a fee the Spanish soccer club said was 78
million pounds ($125 million). Real’s victory moved it within
six points of league leader Barcelona.  “I have to keep improving and working hard to be one
hundred percent as soon as possible,” Bale told Real’s website.
“It was a great night and important to my fitness.”  Roma’s lead atop  Italy ’s Serie A was cut to two points as
nearest rivals Napoli and Juventus both won last night. Dries
Mertens got Napoli’s winner in a 2-1 victory at Fiorentina,
while Juve routed Catania 4-0 at home.  Roma, which has the maximum 27 points from nine matches,
hosts last-place Chievo today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
