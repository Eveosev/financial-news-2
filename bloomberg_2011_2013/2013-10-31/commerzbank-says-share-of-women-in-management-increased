Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-largest bank, said the proportion of women in leadership roles
at the company rose last year.  Women accounted for 25.7 percent of the four levels of
management below the executive board at the end of 2012,
compared with 24.2 percent a year earlier, the Frankfurt-based
company said in a  statement  on its website. Commerzbank wants
female staff to make up 30 percent of managers in 2015, the
document shows.  Germany, unlike some countries in  Europe , hasn’t set quotas
to improve the balance of female representation in corporate
management. In 2011, Commerzbank and peers included in the DAX
Index of Germany’s 30 largest publicly traded companies pledged
to meet individual  voluntary  gender diversity targets.  Deutsche Bank AG, Germany’s largest bank, wants to increase
its proportion of female senior executives to 25 percent and
that of women in management to 35 percent by the end of 2018.
The firm’s share of female directors and managing directors,
excluding its Postbank unit, rose to 18 percent in 2012 from
17.1 percent in 2011, the lender said in a  report  earlier this
year.  Neither Commerzbank, which employed 53,601 people at the
end of last year, nor Deutsche Bank, with its 98,219 full-time-equivalent staff, employ women on their executive boards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
