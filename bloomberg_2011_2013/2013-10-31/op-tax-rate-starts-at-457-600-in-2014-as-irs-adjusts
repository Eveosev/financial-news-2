The top U.S. marginal tax rate of
39.6 percent will apply to taxable income of married couples
exceeding $457,600 in 2014, up 1.7 percent from this year, the
 Internal Revenue Service  said today.  The top rate will start at $406,750 for individuals, up
from $400,000 this year. Taxpayers will start having taxes
withheld from paychecks at those rates in January 2014 and will
pay them when they file their tax returns in 2015.  The tax agency released brackets and inflation adjustments
for dozens of tax provisions that are automatically changed
annually. The inflation adjustments are the first since Congress
created a seven-bracket income-tax structure in January.  The per-person standard deduction will rise to $6,200 from
$6,100 and the personal exemption will be $3,950, up from
$3,900.  The per-person estate-tax exclusion, which is now pegged
permanently to inflation, will be $5.34 million, up from $5.25
million.  Inflation didn’t increase enough to spur increases in some
thresholds. For example, the tax-advantaged contribution limit
for 401(k) retirement plans will remain at $17,500.  Other tax provisions, such as the $1,000  child tax credit 
and the $3,000 ordinary income deduction for capital losses,
aren’t tied to inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
