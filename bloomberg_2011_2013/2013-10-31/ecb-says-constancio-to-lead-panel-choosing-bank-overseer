European Central Bank Vice President
 Vitor Constancio  will take charge of selecting the head of
Europe’s upcoming common bank supervisory board.  Constancio will be joined by ECB Governing Council members
Klaas Knot and Luc Coene, as well as former executive board
member Sirkka Haemaelaeinen from  Finland  and former Danish
central-bank governor, Bodil Nyboe Andersen, on a panel to
select the chairperson of the ECB Supervisory Board, an ECB
spokeswoman said in an e-mail. All have considerable experience
in financial markets, the spokeswoman said.  Applications for the post closed on Oct. 21, with Daniele Nouy, an official at the Bank of  France , named by four euro-area
central-bank officials as being the leading candidate. After a
row between the Frankfurt-based ECB and the European Parliament
over the dearth of women in top management jobs at the central
bank, the post is expected to go to a woman.  Sharon Bowles, chairwoman of the parliament’s Economic and
Monetary Affairs Committee, said this month that “if a very
good woman is put forward, all else being equal, the parliament
will choose her.”  The ECB is setting up four new departments, each under a
director general, for bank supervision. The role is part of a
Europe-wide banking union that aims to prevent a repeat of the
financial-sector turmoil that set off Europe’s worst recession
since World War II. ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen
said on Oct. 15 that the bank will hire approximately 1,000 new
staff to carry out supervisory tasks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
