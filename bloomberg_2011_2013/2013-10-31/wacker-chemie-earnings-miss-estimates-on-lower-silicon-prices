Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) ,  Europe ’s largest
polysilicon maker, reported third-quarter earnings that missed
analyst estimates as prices for semiconductor wafers and solar
silicon fell amid heightened competition from  Asia .  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization declined 19 percent to 167.9 million euros ($230.1
million), the Munich-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts had estimated EBITDA of 183.2 million euros.  Wacker reiterated its forecast that full-year sales will
drop about 3 percent to 4.5 billion euros amid a decline in
earnings. While a compromise in a solar dispute between the
European Union and  China  boosted polysilicon demand, selling
prices for the solar panel components stayed low, Chief
Executive Officer Rudolf Staudigl said.  “Demand for polysilicon continued to surge in the third
quarter,” Staudigl said in the statement. “The prices for
solar silicon remain a challenge. They were about one third
lower than a year ago.”  Third-quarter sales fell 3 percent to 1.17 billion euros,
also missing a 1.19 billion-euro analyst estimate. Net income
plunged 81 percent to 5.4 million euros.  Wacker Chemie is majority-owned by the founding family’s
holding company, Dr. Alexander Wacker Familiengesellschaft mbH.  To contact the reporter on this story:
