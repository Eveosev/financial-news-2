U.K. stocks  fell from their highest
level since May, trimming a monthly gain, as  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  and AstraZeneca Plc reported declines in quarterly profit.  Shell fell 4.6 percent, contributing the most to a decline
in the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index. (UKX)  AstraZeneca lost 2.5 percent as
third-quarter earnings and sales missed analysts’ estimates.
 Croda International Plc (CRDA)  tumbled 6.6 percent after forecasting
that profit will stagnate in the fourth quarter.  BG Group Plc (BG/) 
rose 1 percent after earnings surpassed analysts’ predictions.  The FTSE 100 Index slid 25.27 points, or 0.4 percent, to
6,752.43 at 9:02 a.m. in London. The gauge has still gained 4.5
percent this month as U.S. lawmakers ended a 16-day government
shutdown and agreed to extend the borrowing authority until
early 2014. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also lost 0.4
percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated 0.3 percent.  The Federal Reserve announced late yesterday that it would
maintain its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases until “the
outlook for the labor market has improved substantially.”
Still, the Fed committee dropped its warning from last month’s
meeting that “tightening” financial conditions could impair
the economic recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
