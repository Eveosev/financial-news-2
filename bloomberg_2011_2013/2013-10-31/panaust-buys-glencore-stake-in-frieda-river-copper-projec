  PanAust Ltd. (PNA) , the Australian
operator of copper, gold and silver mines in  Laos , agreed to pay
as much as $125 million for  Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) ’s majority
stake in a Papua New Guinea project to add long-term production.  Frieda River could produce 100,000 metric tons of copper
and 160,000 ounces of gold a year and have a mine life of 18
years, the Brisbane-based company said today in a presentation
on the deal. It will need development capital of $1.5 billion to
$1.8 billion, it said.  “The acquisition of Frieda River will be consistent with
PanAust’s strategy to ensure that it has access to sufficient
mineral resources,” the company said in the statement. The
project is “one of the largest undeveloped copper and gold
deposits in the world,” according to PanAust.  Producers from Mongolia to  Chile  are developing new copper
mines or expanding existing pits to boost output after prices
more than tripled in the past decade on demand from  China , the
biggest consumer of the metal. While purchases of the metal in
the world’s second-largest economy are projected to slow, demand
is poised to rise in the U.S. and Europe, UBS AG analyst Tom Price said Oct. 30 at a Melbourne conference.  Glencore Xstrata, which completed the takeover of Xstrata
Plc in May to create the fourth-largest mining company, is
suspending and selling Xstrata projects as it seeks to make
estimated cost savings of $2 billion in 2014.  PanAust will pay $75 million in two installments by Dec.
2015 and as much as $50 million once the project has been
developed, Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore said in a separate
statement. PanAust dropped 2 percent to A$1.98 at 10:09 a.m. in
Sydney trading, giving it a market value of A$1.2 billion
($1.1 billion).  The Australia producer will also take a 7.5 percent stake
in Highland Pacific Ltd., which holds a 20 percent interest in
Frieda River, PanAust said in its statement. Highlands jumped 39
percent to 8.5 Australian cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
