Kenya ’s armed forces said they
bombed a training camp of more than 300 recruits of the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab Islamist group in the Dinsoor region
Somalia.  The camp at Hurguun was used by al-Shabaab to train
operatives including some of those who carried out an attack on
the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, on Sept. 21,
killing at least 67 civilian and security personnel, the Kenya
Defence Forces, known as the KDF, said in an e-mailed statement
today. Four combat vehicles and a weapons store at the base were
destroyed, according to the KDF.  Many recruits “are believed to have perished, with many
others suffering injuries,” the KDF said. “Operations of this
nature will be sustained into the future.”  Kenya deployed more than 4,000 troops to  Somalia  in 2011,
blaming the Islamists for a series of kidnappings and the murder
of a British tourist at a Kenyan beach resort. Those forces
joined African Union troops from  Uganda  and Burundi as well as a
military deployment from  Ethiopia  in pushing Al-Shabaab out of
Somalia’s major population centers including Mogadishu, the
capital.  The Islamists threatened retaliation against Kenya and
other countries with troops in Somalia, bombing a bar in Uganda
in 2010 and claiming responsibility for the Westgate attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
