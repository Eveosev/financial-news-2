Leonard M. Leiman, who led the securities-law practice at New York-based Reavis & McGrath when it merged in 1988 with Fulbright & Jaworski in what was then among the largest such marriages in history, has died. He was 82.  He died yesterday at his home in  Manhattan  following a brief illness, his son, Alan Leiman, said today in an interview.  Leiman (pronounced LY-man) was, until his death, of counsel in the New York office of London-based Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, the successor to the firm he joined in 1956. His last financial-services client was Siebert Financial Corp., the firm founded by Muriel Siebert, the first woman to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. She died in August.  The 1988 merger of Houston-based Fulbright & Jaworski with Reavis & McGrath created the seventh-largest firm in the U.S., with more than 575 lawyers, according to an article in the  New York  Times. The Times said it was the biggest law-firm merger at the time; the Wall Street Journal called it “among” the largest.  Leiman took part in the first exploratory meeting of leaders of the two firms late in 1987, according to Steven B. Pfeiffer, who last year finished a 10-year term as chairman of Fulbright & Jaworski’s executive committee.  Consolidation Trend  “If they hadn’t hit it off at the very beginning and had a shared vision,” the merger “wouldn’t have gone anywhere,” Pfeiffer said today in an interview.  The merger, which took effect on the first day of 1989, was part of a wave of consolidations driven by mid-size firms, with 100 to 200 lawyers, that needed to compete with bigger partnerships offering more service at lower prices, the Times  said .  Fulbright & Jaworski, the larger partner, with 475 lawyers, sought the merger to take advantage of Reavis & McGrath’s presence in New York and  Los Angeles . Leiman was among the best-known lawyers at Reavis & McGrath, along with Frederick R. Adler, who headed its venture-capital practice.  Reavis & McGrath had suffered along with the rest of the finance industry following the Black Monday stock-market crash of October 1987. Still, Leiman insisted to the Times that the firm didn’t agree to merge out of weakness.  “It was not done out of economic necessity,” he was quoted as saying. “We are enjoying a good year.”  Watergate Link  The combined firm carried the name of Fulbright & Jaworski, which had been  founded  in 1919 by Houston lawyers R. Clarence Fulbright and John H. Crooker and renamed in 1974 to highlight the role of Leon Jaworski, who had gained fame as the second special prosecutor in the investigation of the Watergate scandal that brought down the presidency of  Richard Nixon .  The combined firm completed a new merger with London-based Norton Rose LLP in June to form Norton Rose Fulbright, one of the 10 biggest law firms in the world by revenue. The Fulbright & Jaworski name continues for the U.S. unit of the U.K. firm.  Leonard Morris Leiman was born on July 2, 1931, in Maspeth, part of the New York City borough of Queens. He was one of two children of Jacob Leiman, an attorney, and his wife Sally.  He graduated from  Wesleyan University  in Middletown,  Connecticut , in 1951 and Harvard University Law School in 1954, serving as an editor of the Harvard Law Review.  Making Partner  He worked as a law clerk for Judge Learned Hand of the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit, and Justice John Marshall Harlan of the U.S. Supreme Court.  He joined Reavis & McGrath in 1956, when it had 18 lawyers, his son said. He became a  partner  in 1963. From 1964 to 1966 he worked in  Washington  as executive assistant to Manuel Cohen, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under President  Lyndon Johnson .  He was a member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the Legal Affairs Committee of the New York Stock Exchange.  In addition to his son, a partner with Leiman & Johnson LLC in Eugene,  Oregon , survivors include his wife of 58 years, the former Joan Maisel; a daughter, Elizabeth; his sister, Joan Leiman Jacobson; and three grandchildren.
