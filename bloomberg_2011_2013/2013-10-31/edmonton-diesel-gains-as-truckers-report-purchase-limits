Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  Edmonton 
reached its highest level since February this month as truckers
reported restrictions on purchases at Alberta gas stations.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ’s 140,000-barrel-a-day refinery in
Edmonton had an upset on Oct. 28, the company reported, and fuel
suppliers have restricted sales of diesel citing “minor
unplanned maintenance” at the refinery, according to the
Alberta Motor Transport Association. Suncor representatives
didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment today.  “They’re getting notes from the refinery saying they’re
being limited,” said Don Wilson, executive director of the
organization, which represents companies with fleets of trucks.
“They made it sound like it was no big deal, we do it every
season, and no, that’s not what I’m seeing.”  Suncor raised its price today for No. 2 ultra-low-sulfur
diesel 2.9 cents to $3.414 a gallon at the wholesale rack in
Edmonton, where distributors buy and load product, data compiled
by  Schneider Electric ’s DTN show. The price reached an eight-month high of $3.4597 a gallon on Oct. 17.  Gas stations are limiting diesel sales to certain hours on
some days of the week, Wilson said. Suncor hasn’t communicated
any information about the maintenance directly to the transport
association, Wilson said, and the group may take the matter to
to Albertan officials including Transportation Minister Ric McIver.  To contact the reporters on this story:
