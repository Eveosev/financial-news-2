Harris Corp. (HRS)  lost its challenge of a
$3.5 billion contract awarded to  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  to run the
U.S. Navy’s communications network.  The  Government Accountability Office  today upheld HP’s
five-year agreement, according to a company e-mailed statement.
Harris had challenged the June 27 award. GAO, which confirmed
the decision, hasn’t released its findings.  “The Navy has selected the right team for the challenges
ahead, bringing to sailors and marines new and innovative
thinking coupled with more than a decade of experience building
and operating the network,” Marilyn Crouther, senior vice
president and general manager for an HP unit, said in a
statement.  Jaime O’Keefe, a Harris spokeswoman, declined in an e-mail
to comment on the decision.  Palo Alto, California-based HP has operated the 800,000-user network since 2008. The company is the 26th largest federal
contractor, receiving $2.6 billion in contracts in fiscal 2012,
according to  Bloomberg Government .  Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC)  withdrew its protest of the award
in August. The  Falls Church , Virginia-based company declined to
give a reason.  HP’s team for the so-called Next Generation Enterprise
Network includes  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , International Business
Machines Corp., AT&T Inc. and  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)   -- Editors: Elizabeth Wasserman, Bernard Kohn  To contact the reporters on this story:
