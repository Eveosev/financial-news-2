Asian  stocks  fell, trimming the best
two-month rally for the regional benchmark gauge since the start
of 2012, after the  Federal Reserve  fueled bets it may start
paring stimulus sooner than previously forecast.  Alacer Gold Corp. sank 4.1 percent in Sydney as the price
of the precious metal declined.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  lost 1.3 percent
after  Japan ’s third-largest carmaker reported second-quarter
profit that missed analysts’ estimates amid slowing motorcycle
sales in Southeast Asia.  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  retreated
2.5 percent as expenses climbed at the country’s largest lender
by assets.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.6 percent to 142.36
as of 6:34 p.m. in Hong Kong, with eight of the 10 industry
groups on the measure retreating. While the Fed said fiscal
policy is “restraining economic growth,” policy makers see
signs of “underlying strength.” The  Bank of Japan  kept its
policy unchanged at a meeting today.  “Tapering is inevitable, and that’s what you read from
last night’s statement,” said  Donald Williams , Sydney-based
chief investment officer at Platypus Asset Management Ltd.,
which oversees about A$1.6 billion ($1.5 billion). “The timing
is still unsure, but the market is going to price in the
likelihood of tapering in the next six months at the latest.”  The odds of the Fed starting to taper its stimulus in
January rose to 45 percent from 25 percent before yesterday’s
statement, Citigroup Inc. said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
Oct. 17-18 predicted the Fed would begin paring stimulus in
March.  Regional Gauges  Japan’s  Topix index  lost 0.9 percent as the Bank of Japan
maintained its campaign of unprecedented monetary stimulus.
Governor  Haruhiko Kuroda ’s board kept a pledge to expand the
monetary base by between 60 trillion yen and 70 trillion yen
($712 billion) a year, in a decision released in  Tokyo  today.
That matched the forecasts of all 34 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  China ’s Shanghai Composite declined 0.9 percent after the
nation’s top four banks posted their biggest increase in soured
loans since at least 2010.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  retreated
0.4 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index slipped 0.6 percent
and Taiwan’s Taiex Index lost 0.2 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
Index slid 1.4 percent.  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.9 percent after the
central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  at a record low.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.1 percent.  U.S. Futures  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 2.7 percent in October,
for its second monthly increase. That pushed its  price-earnings
ratio  to 13.7 times estimated earnings from 12.7 at the end of
August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with 15.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 14.9 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.3 percent today after the
equity gauge yesterday lost 0.5 percent, halting a four-day
winning streak.  The Fed maintained its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases yesterday as expected by strategists, saying it needs
to see more evidence that the economy is improving.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is pushing unprecedented
accommodation into the final months of his term as he seeks to
shield the four-year economic expansion from the impact of
higher borrowing costs and this month’s partial U.S. government
shutdown. The 16-day closing resulted in the furloughs of as
many as 800,000 federal workers and delayed release of data the
Fed says it needs to evaluate the economy.  Earnings Season  Of the companies on the Asia-Pacific gauge that have
reported quarterly results this season and for which Bloomberg
compiles estimates, 48 percent have exceeded analysts’ estimates
on profit, while 53 percent posted better-than-expected revenue.  Gold lost 0.7 percent to $1,334.66 an ounce, dragging
producers of the metal lower. Alacer fell 4.1 percent to A$3.02
and Perseus Mining Ltd. declined 6.5 percent to 43.5 Australian
cents.  Honda dropped 1.3 percent to 3,915 yen. Net income climbed
46 percent to 120.4 billion yen in the three months ended Sept.
30, trailing the 139 billion yen average estimate of seven
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  National Australia Bank declined 2.5 percent to A$35.31.
The bank’s cost-to-income ratio climbed 130 basis points to 42.6
percent in the year reflecting compensation paid to U.K.
customers, a restructuring of its Australian businesses and
costs related to a reduction in U.K. and Australian employees,
the bank said.  Chinese developers jumped after the Xinhua News Agency
reported China will accelerate the process of public housing
construction, citing President  Xi Jinping  at a study session of
Communist Party’s politburo.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813)  added 5.5 percent to
HK$19.52. Country Garden Holdings Co., controlled by China’s
richest woman Yang Huiyan, rose 3.9 percent to HK$5.30.
Guangzhou R&F Properties Co., a builder in the southern Chinese
