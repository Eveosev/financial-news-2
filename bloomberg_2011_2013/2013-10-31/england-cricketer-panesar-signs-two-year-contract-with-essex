England cricketer Monty Panesar
signed a two-year contract with Essex following his loan spell
with the second-tier county side at the end of last season.  The spin bowler joined Essex in August when Division One
side Sussex released him following an investigation into a
drunken incident outside a nightclub.  “I loved playing for Essex last season,” Panesar said
according to a statement on the team’s  website . “In the short
time I was there I was made to feel very welcome, both in the
team and around the club.  “It helped me to feel respected and loved as a cricketer
after experiencing a challenging time in my life,” he added.  The left-armer, who had recently divorced before the
nightclub incident, took 14 wickets in six appearances for
Essex. The county side narrowly missed out on promotion to the
top tier.  “We are delighted that Monty has decided to join our
club,” Derek Bowden, Essex’s chief executive officer, said.
“He was on top of our list for new players and it’s great to
finalize his signing in good time for next season.”  Panesar, 31, is currently in  Australia  as part of the
England squad which is bidding for a fourth successive Ashes
series victory. The first of five Tests gets under way in
Brisbane on Nov. 21. Panesar has taken 164 wickets in his 48
Tests.  His Sussex contract was to expire after the 2015 campaign.
