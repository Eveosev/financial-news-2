Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP) , a Spanish
bank forced to sell shares last year to cover a capital
shortfall, surged in  Madrid  after Chief Executive Officer
Francisco Gomez said new loan defaults will ease significantly
next year.  Banco Popular  climbed as much as 7.3 percent to 4.19 euros,
the biggest increase in three months. The shares rose 5.8
percent at 1:59 p.m., valuing the company at 7.4 billion euros
($10.1 billion). Gomez told analysts on a webcast today that he
was also optimistic about lending margins.  Gomez spoke as Banco Popular reported net income falling 25
percent to 56.9 million euros in the third quarter from a year
ago. That beat the 40 million euros estimated by analyst Ignacio Ulargui at  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA)  Popular is
targeting annual  earnings  of 1.4 billion euros by next year as
it rebuilds profit after a balance-sheet cleanup that caused a
2.46 billion-euro loss in 2012.  “We count on a model that’s sustainable, profitable and
well-prepared to gradually generate greater returns than our
competitors and in a sustained way,” Gomez said.  The bank will take a decision on whether to reinstate its
dividend before year-end and aims to resume a policy of
distributing 50 percent of profit to shareholders, said Gomez in
a news conference in Madrid today. The bank, which suspended its
dividend a year ago, is on course to meet a target of earning
500 million euros this year, he said.  Bad Debt  Non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending rose
to 11.8 percent from 10.8 percent at the end of the second
quarter, Popular said. The bank has reclassified 2.4 billion
euros of refinanced loans as non-performing so far this year and
expects the total amount reclassified during 2013 to reach 3.2
billion euros, said Gomez.  Banco Popular’s shares jumped by two thirds since the end
of June as investors bet the stock was oversold even as the
company faced rising bad loans and weak credit demand.  Net interest income fell to 603.7 million euros in the
third quarter from 659.9 million euros in the previous three
months and 667.7 million euros in the same quarter a year ago,
the bank said.  The lender said it cut its use of emergency borrowing under
the  European Central Bank ’s LTRO program by 5.2 billion euros to
8.5 billion euros during the quarter and its total use of ECB
funding by 9.9 billion euros to 8.9 billion euros.  Banco Popular also reduced its bond portfolio to 19 billion
euros from 23.6 billion euros. Gross  lending  fell 4 percent from
a year ago, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
