Henderson Group Plc (HGG)  said it
increased assets under management by 2.9 billion pounds ($4.6
billion) in the third quarter as as the company reported its
first net inflows into equities in 2 1/2 years.  Assets climbed to 70.8 billion pounds from the second
quarter, boosted by net inflows of 1.2 billion pounds, the dual
London and Sydney-traded fund said in a statement today. Net
inflows into equities were 900 million pounds, the first
positive period since the first quarter of 2011.  “The business is performing strongly,” Henderson Chief
Executive Officer Andrew Formica said in the statement. “All
our geographies have seen substantial increases in net flows
during the period. This momentum and strong cash generation
allow us to continue to invest in the business whilst
strengthening our balance sheet further.”  The retail business, which had inflows of 1.3 billion
pounds in the period, “continued to maintain the momentum seen
in the third quarter.” The institutional business reported
“marginal outflows,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
