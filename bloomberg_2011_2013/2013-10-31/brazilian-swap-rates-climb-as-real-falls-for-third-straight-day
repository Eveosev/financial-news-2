Brazil ’s swap rates rose as the
central bank limited rollovers of foreign-exchange swaps,
weakening the real and adding to speculation that policy makers
will raise the target rate to 10 percent to curb inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2017 jumped 10
basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 11.40 percent at
10:17 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the biggest increase since Oct. 21.
They are down two basis points for the month. The real fell for
a third straight day, depreciating 0.3 percent to 2.1972 per
dollar, paring its rally in October to 1.1 percent.  Brazil’s currency fell today as the central bank extended
the maturities on only about $6 billion of the $8.9 billion of
foreign-exchange swaps maturing Nov. 1 in rollover auctions over
the past two weeks. The real has rallied 11 percent, the most in
the world, since policy makers announced on Aug. 22 a program of
swaps and credit lines to buoy the currency and curb import
price increases.  “The real is reacting to the fact that the swap rollover
is less than expected,” Paulo Nepomuceno, the chief economist
at Coinvalores CCVM, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Brazil’s currency also weakened as the U.S. Federal Reserve
saw yesterday signs of economic improvement, fueling concern
that it will curtail a stimulus program that has buoyed
emerging-market assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
