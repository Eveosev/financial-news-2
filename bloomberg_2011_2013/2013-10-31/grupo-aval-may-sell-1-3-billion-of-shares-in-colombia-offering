Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores SA ,
the Colombian banking group controlled by billionaire  Luis Carlos Sarmiento  Angulo, said it may sell about 2.4 trillion
pesos ($1.3 billion) of shares in Bogota.  Grupo Aval’s board considered the share sale in a meeting
yesterday and authorized the company to start getting the
necessary approvals, according to regulatory filing late
yesterday. Aval is seeking to raise capital and bolster its
finances after agreeing to make three acquisitions since
December for $1.4 billion.  The shares fell 4 percent to 1,315 pesos at the close of
trading in Bogota, the biggest drop in two years. It was the
worst performance on Colombia’s benchmark  Colcap index , which
declined 0.9 percent.  “The amount was surprising,” Juan C. Dominguez, an
analyst at Credicorp Capital’s  Colombia  unit, said in a
telephone interview. “It seems pretty high if you compare it to
the purchases they’ve made.”  Aval has pledged to buy at least $500 million of shares in
a separate capital raise planned for November by  Banco de Bogota
SA , the biggest of its four banks.  The group said today in a filing that it’s withdrawing a
registration with U.S. regulators to sell shares in  New York .
Chief Executive Officer Luis Carlos Sarmiento Gutierrez,
Sarmiento Angulo’s son, told reporters Sept. 27 that while Aval
was prepared to go forward with the sale in New York, the
markets weren’t cooperating.  To contact the reporters on this story:
