Japan’s  Topix index  swung between
gains and losses as signs the  Federal Reserve  may cut stimulus
sooner than expected weighed on investor sentiment while a
weaker yen limited declines.  The  Topix (TPX)  slid 0.1 percent to 1,203.44 as of 9:06 a.m. in
Tokyo, after rising less than 0.1 percent. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average lost 0.4 percent to 14,440.09. Japan’s currency held
steady at 98.48 against the dollar after sliding for four
straight days. Today is the busiest day of the country’s
earnings season, with the  Bank of Japan  also scheduled to issue
a policy statement.  The Fed decided to press on with $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases at its meeting yesterday, saying it needs to see
more evidence that the economy is improving amid signs of
“underlying strength.” The central removed a sentence from its
previous policy statement that had said tighter financial
conditions could slow the improvement in the economy, sparking
speculation it might cut stimulus in the coming months.  The odds of the U.S. starting to taper in January rose to
45 percent, from 25 percent before yesterday’s statement,
Citigroup Inc. said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Oct. 17-18
had predicted the Fed will begin paring stimulus in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
