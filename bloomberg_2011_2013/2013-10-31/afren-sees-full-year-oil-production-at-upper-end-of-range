Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K. oil and gas
producer in Africa and Iraq, said higher flows from  Nigeria  will
push 2013 output toward the upper end of its forecast. Shares
jumped to the most in more than two years.  Production will approach the top of a 40,000 barrel to
47,000 barrel-a-day range, the London-based company said today
in a statement. It reported an 18 percent increase in year-to-date output to 48,573 barrels of oil equivalent a day, citing
growth at Nigeria’s Ebok and Okoro fields.  Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil-producing nation, accounts
for most of Afren’s sales, providing the company with cash to
invest elsewhere including in  South Africa  and Kurdistan.  Afren rose 6.6 percent to 157.7 pence at the close in
London trading, the highest price since July 2011. That values
the company at 1.7 billion pounds ($2.7 billion).  Ebok production averaged 35,102 barrels of oil a day in the
nine months through September, a jump of 22 percent from a year
earlier, while Okoro’s output rose 17 percent to average 18,214
barrels a day, Afren said. The company also said it found a
“significant” light-oil accumulation at Nigeria’s Ogo-1 well.  “There are two clear positives today: firstly that
exploration is delivering and secondly that production is
delivering,”  Mark Wilson , an analyst at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in
London, said in an e-mail. “For an exploration and production
company, it’s as much as you can ask for.”  Profit after tax totaled $128.6 million in the third
quarter, a 4.7 percent increase from a year earlier, according
to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
