UBS AG (UBSN)  is teaming with  Wells Fargo &
Co. (WFC)  to provide a $450 million loan on a Manhattan tower as the
bank seeks to maintain its footing in the commercial-mortgage
 bond market  following employee defections in April.  Switzerland’s largest lender plans to package the seven-year mortgage on 11 Penn Plaza into securities, according to two
people with knowledge of the transaction, who asked not to be
identified because it hasn’t been announced. The offering will
be marketed to investors in December, one of the people said.  The transaction would rank among the largest commercial-mortgage bond deals for UBS since a group of bankers including
Ken Cohen, who had run the team since 2011, left earlier this
year after the bank cut bonuses. The Zurich-based lender is
boosting its presence in the $550 billion market, in which
issuance of bonds linked to everything from malls to skyscrapers
poised to double to $70 billion in 2013, according to Credit
Suisse Group AG.  Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for UBS in New York, and Jen
Hibbard of Well Fargo said they couldn’t comment.  Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) ’s 11 Penn Plaza is a 23-floor office
building across the street from Madison Square Garden and  Penn
Station . Macy’s Inc., which operates its flagship department
store two blocks away, renewed a lease for 646,000 square feet
at the property in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
