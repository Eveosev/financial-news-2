Gold posted the biggest loss in
almost three weeks and silver had the largest slump in more than
a month as the  Federal Reserve  fueled speculation that it will
trim U.S. monetary stimulus sooner than anticipated.  The economy shows signs of “underlying strength,” Fed
policy makers said yesterday. The statement pointed to the
possibility of reduced bond purchases as soon as December,
Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc said. The dollar headed for the
longest rally in eight weeks against a basket of 10 currencies.  “The tapering has to come at some point and will be sooner
than later,” David Lee, a vice president at Heraeus Precious
Metals Management in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“The dollar’s strength is working against gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1.9 percent to

This month, the price fell 0.2 percent.  The odds that the Fed will scale back $85 billion in
monthly debt purchases in January rose to 45 percent from 25
percent before the latest statement by policy makers, Citigroup
said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg last week predicted
tapering in March.  This year, gold has slumped 21 percent, heading for the
first annual loss since 2000. Some investors lost faith in the
metal as a store a value amid a U.S. equity rally to a record
