A group led by New Generation Power
LLC, a U.S. clean energy developer, has signed contracts to
build 315 megawatts of solar plants in  India .  The group expects to invest $400 million by the end of 2014
to complete installations at various sites across Andhra Pradesh
state, Chicago-based New Generation said in a statement. The
plants will sell power under 20-year contracts to the local
utility.  Mumbai-based Waaree Group and Hyderabad-based Premier Solar
Group have been selected as contractors to design and build the
plants, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
