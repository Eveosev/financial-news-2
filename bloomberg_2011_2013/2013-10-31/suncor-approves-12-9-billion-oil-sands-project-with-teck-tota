Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest
energy company by market value, will proceed with the C$13.5
billion ($12.9 billion) Fort Hills oil sands project as it seeks
to increase production.  The venture with  Total SA (FP)  and  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)  will
begin producing crude in 2017, adding 180,000 barrels a day of
output in northern  Alberta , the company said yesterday in a
statement. Calgary-based Suncor’s share of the costs will be
C$5.5 billion.  The approval comes after Chief Executive Officer  Steve
Williams  earlier this year canceled another venture with Total
in a bid to reduce costs and boost profitability. Fort Hills,
which had initially been slated to start in 2016, has 3.3
billion barrels of reserves and will produce oil for about 50
years, the company said.  “This project will be a significant source of long-term
 cash flow  for the company and contribute strong returns for our
shareholders,” Williams said in the statement.  Suncor’s shares were little changed at C$37.99 at the close
in Toronto before the approval was announced. The stock has 22
buy recommendations from analysts and three holds, according to
 data compiled  by Bloomberg.  Suncor’s third-quarter  net income  rose to C$1.69 billion,
or C$1.13 per share, from C$1.54 billion, or C$1.01, a year ago,
the company said in a separate statement.  “Overall they’ve been increasing bitumen production and
boosting efficiencies,”  Michael Dunn , an analyst at FirstEnergy
Corp. in Calgary, said in an interview before the earnings were
released.  Production Cut  Suncor also lowered its full-year production target to the
equivalent of between 545,000 barrels of oil a day and 590,000
barrels from an earlier outlook of between 570,000 barrels and
620,000 barrels because of disruptions in Libya, planned outages
at Syncrude Canada Ltd. and the sale of part of its natural gas
business in western Canada.  The price of  Canadian heavy crude  rose 8.3 percent to an
average of $83.10 a barrel in the third quarter from a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brent, the
global benchmark, traded at an average of $109.65 in the third
quarter compared with an average price of $109.42 in the year-earlier quarter.  Suncor operates four refineries in  North America  in
Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Colorado that produce fuels,
solvents and petrochemicals, according to the company’s website.
The company also owns wind farms, a biofuel plant and offshore
oil assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
