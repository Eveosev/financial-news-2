Spot gasoline in  San Francisco 
declined against futures for the first time in three days as
 Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  was said to restart the crude unit at its Golden
Eagle refinery.  Gasoline slipped as Tesoro finished repairs on the crude
unit at the 170,000-barrel-a-day  Golden Eagle plant  in Northern
California following a fire on Oct. 26, according to a person
familiar with operations there who asked not to be identified
because the information isnâ€™t public. The plant was seen
returning to normal rates yesterday, the person said.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
San Francisco narrowed 3 cents to 0.5 cent a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg at 1:50 p.m.  New York  time. Prompt
delivery slid 6.62 cents to $2.5904 a gallon.  Carbob in  Los Angeles  weakened 4 cents versus futures to a
premium of 11.5 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and state-grade diesel in Los Angeles shrank
$3.59 a barrel to $11.24. The spread, a rough indicator of
refining profitability in the region, is at the lowest level in
four weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
