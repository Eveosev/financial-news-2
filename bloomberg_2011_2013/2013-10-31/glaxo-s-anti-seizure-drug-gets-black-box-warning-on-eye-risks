GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s anti-seizure
drug Potiga now carries a black-box warning in the U.S. on risks
including potential vision loss.  The warning, the most serious type the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration issues, underscores risks of abnormalities in the
eye, vision loss and skin discoloration, all of which may become
permanent, the FDA said in a  statement  today. The revised label
comes after the risks were flagged by the FDA in April.  Patients should have eye exams before starting Potiga and
every six months during treatment, the FDA said. The drug
accounted for 7 million pounds ($11 million) of the London-based
company’s sales last year and is projected to bring in 39.5
million pounds this year, according to  analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  “In light of these reported adverse events, we have worked
closely with regulators to update the medicine’s labeling to
restrict its use to those patients where other appropriate
medicine combinations have proved inadequate or have not been
tolerated,” Glaxo said in an e-mailed statement today. “We
review the safety of all our medicines on an ongoing basis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
