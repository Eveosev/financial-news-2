Temperatures across the eastern U.S.
are expected to rise above normal next week while dropping
across the West,  MDA Weather Services  said.  Readings from the  Mississippi River  to the East Coast,
including  Chicago , New York and Washington, are forecast to be 3
to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.8 Celsius) higher than usual
from Nov. 5 to Nov. 9, according to MDA in Gaithersburg,
Maryland. Across the West, temperatures are expected to be 3 to
8 degrees lower than the norm.  “Stronger and a bit longer-lasting warmth is expected from
the eastern Midwest to the East through the middle of the period
before a stronger shot of cold pushes eastward out of the
West,” MDA said today.  Below-normal temperatures, especially in Eastern and
Midwestern cities, tend to increase energy consumption as more
people heat homes and businesses. November marks the start of
the U.S. heating season, when natural gas demand peaks.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas use,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. About 49 percent of all homes use
the fuel for heating.  Even with the threat of colder air coming east, MDA
predicts seasonal temperatures in the U.S. Northeast from Nov.
10 to 14, while the South and lower East Coast stay above-normal.  The normal average temperature in New York for Nov. 6 is
about 52 degrees, MDA said. In  Boston , it’s 48; in  St. Louis ,
52;  Dallas , 60; Chicago, 45; in Burbank, California, 63; and in
Calgary, it’s 32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
