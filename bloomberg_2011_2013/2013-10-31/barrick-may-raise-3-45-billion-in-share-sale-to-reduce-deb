Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
largest producer of the metal, plans to sell shares to raise as
much as $3.45 billion to help reduce its debt, which has
increased this year as the price of the commodity declined.  It agreed to sell 163.5 million shares for $18.35 apiece in
a so-called bought deal that’s being underwritten by a group led
by  RBC Capital Markets , Barclays Plc and GMP Securities LP,
Toronto-based Barrick said today in a statement. There’s an
over-allotment option for the sale of an additional 24.5 million
shares, the company said.  Barrick has come under pressure this year after the price
of gold fell 21 percent. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Sokalsky
has explored cash-raising options including a strategic equity
investment, a sale of a stake in its copper business and selling
a stale in its $8.5 billion Pascua-Lama project to a state-backed Chinese investor, people with knowledge of the matter
said yesterday. Barrick said earlier today it will suspend
construction work at Pascua-Lama to help conserve cash.  The announcement of the share sale was made after the close
of regular trading in  New York , where Barrick fell 5.4 percent
to $18.34 at 6 p.m.  Barrick plans to use $2.6 billion from the stock sale to
buy back bonds. It will use $1.1 billion to repurchase $700
million of 1.75 percent notes due 2014 and $350 million of 4.875
percent notes, also due in 2014.  Asset Sales  A further $1.5 billion will be used to buy back bonds from
10 issues due between 2015 and 2023, with priority given to
notes with shorter maturities, the company said in a separate
statement.  Even before today’s announcement, Sokalsky had chosen a
series of measures to counter the gold decline and rising mining
costs, including the sale of some mining and energy assets.
Barrick took $8.7 billion of writedowns in the second quarter
and cut its  dividend .  Long-term debt was $14.6 billion at the end of the third
quarter, up from $12.1 billion at the end of 2012. Barrick said
in a separate  statement  today before announcing the stock sale
that options to improve liquidity included drawing down $4
billion available on a credit facility, further asset sales, and
selling debt or equity either in the public markets or to
private investors, a course of action that may include the
creation of a strategic partnership.  Barrick said today it’s targeting $500 million of
additional annual savings from measures including an
organizational restructuring, which involves cutting 1,850 jobs.  Project Suspension  Today It reported third-quarter earnings excluding tax
adjustments and foreign-exchange losses of 58 cents a share,
topping the 50-cent average of 20  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales declined 12 percent to $2.99 billion, beating
the $2.91 billion average estimate.  The suspension of work at Pascua-Lama will cut  capital
spending  in 2014 by as much as $1 billion and improve near-term
cash flows.  The project is located more than 12,000 feet (3,657 meters)
up in the Andes mountains on the Argentina-Chile border and was
already partially halted amid concerns from local groups about
potential water contamination. Barrick said all activity except
that needed for environmental protection and regulatory
compliance will cease, with a restart depending on future costs,
 gold prices  and the regulatory and legal outlook.  Barrick has struggled with the project, its sole mine-construction project, amid ballooning costs, delays and
environmental challenges. Pascua-Lama was originally expected to
cost no more than $3 billion when construction was approved in
2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
