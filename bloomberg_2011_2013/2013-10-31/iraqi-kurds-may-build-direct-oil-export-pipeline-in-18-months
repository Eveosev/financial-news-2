Iraqi Kurdistan  plans to build a
million-barrel-a-day oil pipeline to Turkey’s Ceyhan port in as
little as 18 months, providing an export link that totally
bypasses Iraq’s existing network.  “Between 18 months to two years from now the new pipeline
from our region to Ceyhan will be ready,”  Ashti Hawrami , the
Kurdish Regional Government’s natural resources minister, told
reporters at an energy conference in Istanbul today.  A new pipeline running from Iraqi Kurdistan to Turkey would
bypass  Baghdad , with which the KRG is embroiled in disputes over
export revenue, and require Turkey’s approval. No one at the
Turkish energy ministry including Minister  Taner Yildiz  was
immediately available to comment when calls were placed to their
offices today.  Kurdistan will complete a 40-kilometer (25-mile) line by
year-end that will link to Iraq’s main export pipeline extending
from Kirkuk to Ceyhan. With a capacity of 300,000 barrels a day,
it won’t meet export needs, he said.  Kurdistan, whose economy has boomed with oil exploration
since  Saddam Hussein ’s ouster in 2003, expects exports to soar
more than 40-fold to 2 million barrels a day by 2020 after the
pipeline network is completed. Producers including  Genel Energy
Plc (GENL) , the region’s largest, are shipping oil on trucks through
Turkey and  Iran  to international buyers, Hawrami said.  Rising Exports  Mehmet Sepil, president of London-listed Genel Energy, said
at the same conference that the 40-kilometer pipeline from Dohuk
to Fishkabur on the Turkish border will carry 200,000 barrels a
day from its Tawke and Taq Taq fields and the remainder from
other producers.  The main line, controlled by the Iraqi central government,
needs maintenance before it can reach full capacity of as much
as 1.6 million barrels a day after years of disuse because of UN
sanctions against Hussein’s regime.  The Kurdish region, which exports 30,000 to 50,000 barrels
a day of Genel Energy crude by truck to  Turkey , plans to
increase shipments to 1 million barrels a day by the end of 2015
and 2 million barrels a day by 2020 once the pipeline network is
operational, Hawrami said.  The Kurdish region’s oil-production capacity will rise to
400,000 barrels a day by the end of this year from 300,000
barrels a day now, Hawrami said.  KRG also plans to start shipping natural gas to Turkey,
where demand will probably grow 10 percent to 48 billion cubic
meters this year, from 2016 or 2017 at an annual rate of 10
billion cubic meters, Hawrami said. “Turkey is a very important
market for our gas and a very important corridor for our
energy.”  KRG will set up its own metering system near Fishkabur to
monitor oil flow once the Dohuk-Fishkabur pipeline is
operational, Hawrami said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
