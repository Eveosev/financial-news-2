  Weight Watchers International Inc. (WTW) ,
the weight-control program provider endorsed by celebrities
 Jennifer Hudson  and Jessica Simpson, had a record decline in
shares after the company suspended its dividend as it struggles
to recruit members.  Weight Watchers fell 20 percent to $32.11 at the close in
 New York , the biggest drop since the company went public in
November 2001. The shares have retreated 39 percent this year,
compared with a 23 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Declining enrollment in Weight Watchers programs may hurt
2014 sales by a “low double-digit” percentage, the New York-based company said yesterday on a conference call. Directors
elected to suspend the quarterly cash dividend, which will save
$39 million for financial flexibility and growth initiatives,
the company also said in a statement.  Better-than-expected quarterly results were “overshadowed
by weaker-than-expected 2014 guidance and a dividend cut,” Dara
Mohsenian, an analyst for  Morgan Stanley & Co . in New York, said
today in a note. He rates the shares equal-weight, the
equivalent of a hold.  Third-quarter net income fell 11 percent to $60.3 million,
or $1.07 a share, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
