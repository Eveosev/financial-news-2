Central Chile was struck by a 6.6-magnitude earthquake this evening that caused buildings to shake
in the capital of Santiago.  The offshore temblor struck 363 kilometers (226 miles)
outside Santiago in the north-central region of Coquimbo at a
depth of 10.7 kilometers, the U.S. Geological Survey said in a
bulletin posted on its website.  The government has received no reports of injuries or
damage, the official emergency service known as Onemi said in a
bulletin posted on its website. The quake doesnâ€™t pose the
threat of a tsunami on Chilean shores, it said.  Chile was hit by an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in 2010 that
caused the death of more than 500 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
