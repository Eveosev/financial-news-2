Wi-Lan Inc. (WIN) ’s back-to-back trial
losses undermines the Canadian company’s strategy of buying
patents and suing to obtain royalties, reducing its value in a
potential sale.  Wi-Lan said yesterday it was considering a possible sale,
after it lost a trial last week against  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in which it
was seeking $248 million. In July, it lost a trial against
Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson AB, though it later settled with
Alcatel-Lucent.  The patent-buying binge of 2011 and 2012 that resulted in
the purchase of $4.5 billion worth of patents from Nortel
Networks Inc. and Google Inc.’s $12.4 billion deal to buy
Motorola Mobility Inc. has cooled. At the same time, a series of
court rulings and proposed legislation in U.S. Congress have
limited the value of patents owned by companies that don’t make
products.  “They won’t command the price they could have gotten a
year ago,” said JiNan Glasgow, chief executive officer of
patent-research company Neo Patents in Durham,  North Carolina .
“There’s been a trend showing that only the highest quality
patents are standing up in litigation. The most value for
patents is when they are actually making or selling products or
services and they use the patents to keep competitors out.”  Wi-Lan  shares  fell 1.2 percent to C$3.26 at 9:33 a.m. in
Toronto for a market value of C$394.3 million ($378.2 million).
The stock rose 6.5 percent yesterday after the company said it
would also consider a dividend payout, joint ventures and asset
disposals.  Dividend Payout  The company “strongly believes in its current business
strategy,” and its share price doesn’t take into account “its
strong balance sheet, the value of its signed license
agreements, its business prospects or the residual value of its
broad intellectual property portfolio,” Ottawa-based Wi-Lan
said.  Wi-Lan, which reports third-quarter results Nov. 6, had no
further comment beyond its statement, said Tyler Burns, a
spokesman for the company.  Wi-Lan could pay out at least $60 million, or about 50
cents a share, Justin Kew, a Toronto-based analyst with Cantor
Fitzgerald LP, said in a note to clients yesterday.  The company has lost 20 percent since Apple won a patent-infringement trial on Oct. 23, thwarting its demand for
royalties for wireless technology used in mobile devices.  Wi-Lan has lost 28 percent this year, the worst performer of the
S&P/TSX Information Technology  index , which rose 27 percent.  BlackBerry Different  BlackBerry Ltd., the struggling smartphone maker seeking a
buyer, is the only other stock in the seven-member  index  to have
lost value this year, declining 28 percent. Its patent portfolio
could be a central attraction for bidders.  “There is a significant difference between BlackBerry
launching a licensing program, where they can bundle know-how,
industrial specifications, technical consulting, as well as the
patents, and Wi-Lan continuing their patent enforcement
operations,” said Erin-Michael Gill, managing director of MDB
Capital Group, an IP-focused investment bank based in  Santa
Monica ,  California .  MDB has said BlackBerry patents may fetch $2 billion to $3
billion, though much less if they have been widely licensed.  Wi-Lan holds more than 3,000 patents and relies on royalty
payments for all of its sales. The company had revenue of $20
million and a net loss of $7.6 million in the three months ended
June 30.  Potential Buyers  The company, which had $158 million in cash at the end of
the second quarter, will report its third-quarter results Nov.
6. Wi-Lan is forecast to post a net loss of $5.7 million,
according to the  average  of three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Todd Coupland, a Toronto-based analyst at CIBC World
Markets Inc., said the company is worth C$3.67 a share, based on
the licensing deals it’s already signed and the cash on its
balance sheet. Any buyer, he said, would be getting a free
option on any future licensing deals.  “Wi-Lan’s assets would be of interest of any number of
consumer electronics manufacturers, however many of the most
probable acquirers are likely already licensed,” Gill said.  Other patent-licensing companies, like  Acacia Research
Corp. (ACTG)  based in  Newport Beach , California or Wilmington,
Delaware-based  InterDigital Inc. (IDCC) , may be interested, along with
private-equity investors, Coupland said. Apple and Google Inc.,
who were responsible for several of the past big patent deals,
are unlikely to buy the company, he said.  Antennae, Networks  “They essentially have beefed up their patent portfolio so
they’re in a position to defend the products in their pipeline
with the IP they have on the books today,” he said. He rates
Wi-Lan sector underperform, the equivalent of a sell, with a
price target of C$3.  While prices have “plateaued” from a year or two ago,
there’s still a market for buying patents that are then used for
royalties or a competitive advantage, said John F. Martin, chief
executive officer of Austin, Texas-based  Innography Inc.,  a
maker of software programs to analyze patent portfolios.  “We’re seeing more patents for sale than ever before,”
Martin said. “The patent intermediaries are treating patents as
assets and determining how to best monetize those.”  Wi-Lan, which developed some of its own technology and
bought others, owns patents in the area of signals, antennae,
wireless communication and networks, and most last beyond 2020,
according to Innography data. That would make it attractive to
potential buyers, though the recent trial losses will be a
factor in any eventual price, he said.  More Legislation  “Litigation is hugely risky,” Martin said. “You never
know what’s going to happen when you put a technical patent
claim in front of a jury.”  A series of U.S. court rulings since 2006 have made it
easier to invalidate patents, and lessened the amount that can
be collected in damages. The  U.S. Congress  is considering even
more legislation that could further reduce the value of patents
owned by licensing companies.  In a July interview, Wi-Lan Chief Operating Officer Michael Vladescu said the legislative proposals were aimed at curbing
abusive litigation tactics, like companies that blanket entire
industries with letters demanding cash to avoid a lawsuit. More
than 90 percent of its licensing details didn’t require a
lawsuit, Vladescu said.  Martin said companies need ways to access patented
technology, and licensing firms will remain a popular business
model.  Apple Power  “I think it’s more a question of what Wi-Lan is deciding
to bring forward in terms of its patent-licensing program, as
opposed to all of a sudden the patent-licensing market’s going
to go away,” Coupland said. “I think it’s more a Wi-Lan
issue.”  All the legal changes have made it harder to win against
big companies like Cupertino, California-based Apple, which can
afford the costs of going to trial so they don’t have an
incentive to settle, Glasgow said.  “It’s been declining in terms of overall wins and returns
on investment that would cause funds to want to buy as many
patents as possible,” she said.  Apple has done this before. It fended off a patent case
that Eastman Kodak Co. said could have meant $1 billion in new
royalties. After Kodak filed for bankruptcy last year, Apple
joined with a group that included Google  and  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  to
buy the patents for $525 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
