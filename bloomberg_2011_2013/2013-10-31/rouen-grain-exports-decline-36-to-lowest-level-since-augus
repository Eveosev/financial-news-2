Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen, Europe’s biggest wheat-shipping hub, fell 36 percent
in the latest week to the lowest since August’s first week as a
barley delivery to Saudi Arabia wasn’t repeated.  Loadings declined to 96,100 metric tons in the Oct. 24-30
period from 150,060 tons in the prior week, according to data
today from the Seine River port. Algeria was the biggest
destination with 75,500 tons of soft wheat and feed barley, from
71,250 tons in the previous week, while no shipments went to
Saudi Arabia, which took 49,150 tons of barley a week earlier.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s soft-wheat
exports in 2012-13, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the North Sea, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
