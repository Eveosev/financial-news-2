The pound jumped more than 1 percent
against the euro, the biggest gain in six months, after euro-area inflation slowed and the jobless rate climbed to a record,
boosting demand for alternatives to  Europe ’s shared currency.  Sterling advanced for a second day versus the euro as the
reports spurred speculation the  European Central Bank  will cut
 interest rates  as soon as its meeting next week to revive
growth. The pound may extend gains, according to UBS AG. U.K.
government bonds fell as an index of U.S. business activity
expanded at the fastest pace since March 2011, damping investor
appetite for safer assets.  “There’s a very sharp decrease in the euro-region
inflation rate and the market is pricing in the ECB might take
some more action,” said  Lutz Karpowitz , a senior currency
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “That’s reflected in
a weaker euro.”  The pound advanced 1.1 percent to 84.70 pence per euro at
4:42 p.m.  London  time, the biggest gain April 25. The rally came
after the U.K. currency slipped to 85.85 pence on Oct. 29, the
weakest since Aug. 29. Sterling was little changed at $1.6047.  The ECB will cut its refinancing rate by a quarter
percentage point to 0.25 percent at its Nov. 7 meeting,
according to a research note from UBS. BNP Paribas SA, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Scotiabank also changed their ECB calls today
and now predict officials will lower rates in December.  Further Gains  There’s room for the pound to extend gains versus the euro
because of the outperformance of the U.K. economy, said  Geoffrey Yu , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at UBS in London.  Sterling will appreciate to 84 pence in three months and to
81 pence by the end of 2014, Yu said.  The euro area’s annual  inflation rate  fell to 0.7 percent,
the lowest since November 2009, from 1.1 percent in September,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists was for
it to stay at 1.1 percent. The data marks the ninth month the
inflation rate has been less than the ECB’s 2 percent ceiling.  The pound has fallen 1.1 percent in the past month, the
worst performer after the Canadian dollar of 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar dropped 0.1 percent and the euro rose 0.8 percent.  The U.K. 10-year yield climbed eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 2.62 percent after declining to 2.52
percent, the lowest level since Aug. 13. The 2.25 percent bond
due in September 2023 fell 0.655, or 6.55 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 96.825.  Business Barometer  The MNI Chicago Report business barometer jumped to 65.9
from 55.7 in September, the biggest monthly increase in more
than three decades. Readings above 50 signal expansion. The
index exceeded the most optimistic estimate in Bloomberg survey.  U.K.  home values  rose 1 percent in October from the
previous month when they climbed 0.9 percent,  Nationwide
Building Society  said. GfK NOP Ltd. said its index of U.K.
consumer sentiment declined to minus 11 from minus 10 in
September. The economy grew 0.8 percent in the third quarter,
the most since 2010, the government said last week.  “Gilts look pretty rich given the improving U.K.
economy,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at
broker RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The rally has
probably gone as far as it can go.”  Ten-year yields will probably rise to 2.70 percent or 2.75
percent by year-end, Stamenkovic said. The rate will climb to
2.90 percent by Dec. 31, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Gilts returned 1.4 percent in the month through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries rose 0.5
percent and German bonds advanced 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
