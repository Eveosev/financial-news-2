Sweden ’s krona slid the most in four
weeks versus the dollar as investors bet euro-area inflation at
the slowest in almost four years will weigh on the Swedish
economy and prompt the central bank to cut  interest rates .  The currency dropped against all except one of its 16 major
counterparts after a European Union estimate showed the annual
rate of inflation in the 17-nation region fell to 0.7 percent,
the lowest since November 2009. Riksbank policy makers have held
their benchmark rate at 1 percent since December, while the
 European Central Bank  cut its key refinancing rate to a record-low 0.5 percent in May.  “What the market is concluding is that if you have low
inflation in the euro zone then you’ll see the same pattern in
Sweden,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, head of foreign-exchange
research at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. “It could put further
pressure on the Riksbank to actually cut rates and that will
have a market impact that’s much bigger than the refi rate cut
from the ECB.”  The krona tumbled 1.2 percent to 6.4697 per dollar as of
4:14 p.m.  London  time, the steepest decline since Oct. 4.
Sweden’s currency fell 0.2 percent to 8.7941 per euro after
depreciating to 8.8194, the weakest level since Oct. 10.  The Swedish currency has tumbled 0.8 percent over the past
week, the worst performer among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
rose 1.2 percent, while the euro declined 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
