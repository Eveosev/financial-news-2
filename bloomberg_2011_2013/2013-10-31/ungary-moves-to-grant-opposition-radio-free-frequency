Hungary’s media regulator will take
steps to grant opposition radio station Klubradio a free
frequency, in a move that may ease concern over press freedom
after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s consolidation of power.  The Media Council “will take the necessary steps to grant
the radio a community broadcast license, which will allow for
free broadcasts,” the regulator said today in an e-mailed
statement. The decision was backed by Monika Karas, the
watchdog’s new head who took over in August after the death of
her predecessor.  Orban has extended his influence over independent
institutions since winning a two-thirds parliamentary majority
in 2010, including by overhauling the media regulator, which is
led exclusively by ruling-party appointees. The European
Commission and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe have criticized the country’s new media law, questioning
the Media Council’s “unusually broad powers.”  The watchdog reassigned Klubradio’s frequency in 2011,
which the station then said was a “de facto ban” of the
opposition radio. Court rulings later scrapped the decision,
prompting the regulator to give Klubradio a temporary license
and then a long-term commercial license.  Hungary has implemented “only a fraction” of the Council
of  Europe  recommendations on protecting media freedom, European
Union Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in March, after Klubradio
was given its commercial license.  To contact the reporter on this story:
