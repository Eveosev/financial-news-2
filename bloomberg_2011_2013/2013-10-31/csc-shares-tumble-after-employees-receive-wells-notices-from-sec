Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) , a provider
of technology consulting to governments and companies, fell the
most in more than five months after signaling that an accounting
probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission is escalating.  As part of an almost three-year investigation by the SEC,
former U.S. executives, along with some current employees
outside the country, have received Wells notices from the
commission, CSC said today in a filing.  The SEC sends a Wells notice to notify that investigators
may recommend an enforcement action. Typically, the company or
individual under investigation has a chance to respond to the
allegations before regulators seek authorization from the SEC’s
five-member commission to pursue sanctions.  CSC shares fell 4.5 percent to $49.26 at the close in New
York. The stock has climbed 23 percent this year.  John Nester , an SEC spokesman, declined to comment.  Chief Executive Officer Mike Lawrie, who took the reins
last year, has been leading a turnaround effort at the  Falls
Church , Virginia-based company, which has struggled with years
of declining sales.  The accounting probe initially involved the company’s
former Managed Services Sector division and focused on the
Nordic region. Eventually CSC’s auditors expanded their internal
investigation to include operations in Australia, its Americas
outsourcing business and a contract with the U.K.’s  National
Health Service . As part of the effort, CSC wrote down its
investment in the U.K. contract last year by almost $1.5
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
