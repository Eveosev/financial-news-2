PT Astra International (ASII) ,  Indonesia ’s
biggest automotive retailer, posted a 6.3 percent drop in third-quarter net income as rising car sales failed to offset declines
in its heavy equipment and palm oil businesses.  Net income in the three months to Sept. 30 fell to 4.68
trillion rupiah ($415 million) from 4.99 trillion rupiah a year
earlier, beating the median estimate for 4.3 trillion rupiah of
three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The earnings were derived
by subtracting first-half figures from nine-month results, which
Astra announced today.  Astra, which sells  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  cars and  Honda Motor
Co. (7267)  motorcycles, is headed for its first annual profit decline
in eight years as a slowdown in the global economy saps demand
for coal and palm oil. The company’s heavy equipment, mining
contracting and agriculture businesses made up about 32 percent
of its revenue and 21 percent of its earnings in the first nine
months, it said.  “Automotive sales are on track for this year,” Robertus
Yanuar Hardy, an analyst at Jakarta-based PT Batavia Prosperindo
Sekuritas, said before the earnings were announced. “It’s the
commodity-related side that’s causing the decline in Astra’s
financial performance.”  Third-quarter sales rose to 47.5 trillion rupiah from 47.2
trillion rupiah the previous year. Rising costs depressed
earnings with nine-month selling expenses gaining 6 percent to 6
trillion rupiah, Jakarta-based Astra said. General and
administrative expenses rose 8.3 percent to 6.9 trillion rupiah,
it said. Business may slow down this year, Astra’s President
Director Prijono Sugiarto said on May 1.  Wage Costs  Astra’s full-year  net income  will probably fall to 18.72
trillion rupiah from 19.42 trillion rupiah in 2012, its first
profit drop since 2006, according to the median estimate of 24
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The company’s shares, which have
dropped 13 percent this year, fell 3.6 percent today ahead of
the results to close at 6,650 rupiah.  “Although automotive sales volume was in good shape, the
company’s revenue was affected by tight competition in the car
market, rising labor costs and falling commodity prices,”
Sugiarto said in a statement. “We predict the business
conditions until the end of 2013 will not change
significantly.”  Astra owns 59.5 percent of  PT United Tractors (UNTR) , the nation’s
biggest heavy equipment seller, whose businesses include mining
contracting and coal mining. Astra also owns 79.7 percent of
Indonesia’s largest publicly listed palm oil company,  PT Astra
Agro Lestari. (AALI)  United Tractors reported yesterday a 23 percent
drop in third-quarter net income, while Astra Agro had a 73
percent profit decline.  Thermal coal at  Australia ’s Newcastle port, the benchmark
grade for  Asia , dropped 11 percent this year to $80.55 in the
week ended Oct. 25, according to IHS McCloskey, a provider of
coal data.  Palm Oversupply  Palm, the world’s most-used cooking oil, may slump to the
lowest level since 2009 by January as global supplies of edible
oils expand and crude oil weakens,  Dorab Mistry , director at
Godrej International Ltd., said Sept. 22. World palm stockpiles
will surge 17 percent to a record 9.2 million tons in 2013-2014
as demand expands 4.5 percent, the least in 12 years, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates.  Indonesia’s January to September domestic automotive sales
rose 11 percent from a year earlier to 908,279 units, while
motorcycle sales climbed 8.6 percent to 5.79 million units.
About half of the cars and motorcycles in Indonesia are sold by
Astra. The company said in April it forecast car sales of 1.05
million units this year, down from 1.1 million in 2012.  Going forward, demand for vehicle sales may weaken on
higher borrowing costs, according to Batavia’s Hardy, who has a
“buy” recommendation on Astra.  Bank Indonesia  has raised its
 benchmark interest rate  by 150 basis points since early June to
7.25 percent, as it tries to curb inflation and bolster the
rupiah.  To contact the reporters on this story:
