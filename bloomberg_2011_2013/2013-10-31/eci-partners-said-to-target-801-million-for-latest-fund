ECI Partners LLP, the U.K.-based
private-equity firm, is planning to raise as much as 500 million
pounds ($801 million) for a new fund next year, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter.  ECI, which was established in 1976, is interviewing
advisers to help with the new pool of capital, with investment
banks  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  and  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  among those bidding
for the job, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the talks are private. The fundraising could begin in
the first quarter of 2014, the person said.  The effort will be the largest attempted by the London and
Manchester, England-based firm, which typically buys companies
valued between 10 million pounds and 150 million pounds,
according to its website. ECI’s previous fund, ECI 9 LP, closed
on 437 million pounds in 2008 and is about 70 percent invested,
the person said.  Thirty-one buyout funds closed in the third quarter of 2013
globally, securing $27.9 billion, down from the $57.5 billion in
the previous quarter, according to London-based data provider
Preqin Ltd. The average time a firm spends raising a fund is now
18.4 months, compared with 17.8 months in 2012 and 11.3 months
in 2006, Preqin said.  Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension
plans and endowments with a mandate to buy companies within five
to six years, then sell them and return the money and a profit
after 10 years. They usually charge a management fee of as much
as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from
investments.  Spokesmen for ECI and Lazard declined to comment. An
Evercore spokesman didn’t respond to an e-mail request seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
