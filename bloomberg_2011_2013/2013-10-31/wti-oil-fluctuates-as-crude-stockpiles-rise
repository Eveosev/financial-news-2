West Texas Intermediate crude
dropped to the lowest level in four months as U.S. stockpiles
increased and the dollar strengthened against the euro.  Prices fell for a third day. Inventories rose to 383.9
million last week, the highest level since June, the Energy
Information Administration said yesterday. The euro declined the
most in six months versus the dollar as inflation in the euro
region unexpectedly dropped. WTI’s discount to Brent shrank from
the widest in seven months as Libya boosted output.  “The U.S. is swimming in oil and it looks like we are
firmly below $100,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “If
there’s weak demand data over the next few weeks, we could soon
be testing $90.”  WTI for December delivery slid 39 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$96.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement since June 26. The volume of all futures traded was
4.9 percent below the 100-day average at 3:23 p.m. Prices
retreated 5.8 percent in October.  Brent for December settlement dropped $1.02, or 0.9
percent, to $108.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume was 4.1 percent above the 100-day
average. Brent gained 0.4 percent this month.  The European benchmark’s premium to WTI was $12.46, up from
$13.09 yesterday, the most since April. WTI weakened $6.42
against Brent in October, the most in at least 10 years.  Supplies Climb  Nationwide crude supplies jumped 7.9 percent in the six
weeks ended Oct. 25, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. The U.S. will account for about 21
percent of global oil demand this year, almost double the
estimate for  China , the second-largest consumer, according to
forecasts from the International Energy Agency in Paris.  “We are having continued reaction to the build in
supplies,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price
Futures Group in Chicago. “After the big inventory gain, it’s
just hard to find anything bullish. The dollar being stronger is
definitely putting some pressure on WTI.”  Crude  stockpiles  at Cushing,  Oklahoma , where WTI is
delivered, climbed 2.18 million barrels to 35.5 million last
week, a two-month high, the EIA said. The refinery utilization
rate was 87.3 percent, compared with as much as 92.8 percent in
July.  “You are seeing this continuing trend of large builds in
the U.S., which is depressing WTI prices,” said Tariq Zahir, a
New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.  Euro Decline  The European currency fell as much as 1.1 percent to
$1.3584 as euro-area inflation cooled to the slowest in almost
four years in October, fueling speculation the European Central
Bank will cut interest rates to boost the recovery. A stronger
dollar and weaker euro reduce oil’s investment appeal.  “Oil is moving with the dollar,” said Bill Baruch, a
senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in  Chicago .  WTI’s discount to Brent narrowed after widening $4.01 in
the first three days of this week as supplies in Libya, holder
of  Africa ’s largest reserves, were cut by half amid protests.  “I don’t expect it to widen any further,” said Julius Walker, global energy markets strategist at UBS Securities LLC
in New York, who forecast WTI will average $95 this quarter.
“It should be self-correcting.”  Libya, North Africa’s largest oil producer, is pumping
350,000 to 400,000 barrels a day, Ibrahim Al Awami, the oil
ministry’s head of measurement and inspection, said by phone
today.  Libyan Output  Output fell as low as 250,000 to 300,000 barrels a day,
Mohamed El Harari, spokesman for the state-run National Oil
Corp., said Oct. 28. The Sharara field in western Libya may be
able to restart within 10 days, said Salah A. Ben Ali, manager
of international cooperation office at the oil and gas ministry.  The country’s  output  climbed 150,000 barrels a day to
450,000 in October, a Bloomberg survey showed. Production last
month was at the lowest level since September 2011.  Crude output by the 12-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries increased 38,000 barrels to an average
30.621 million barrels a day this month from a revised 30.583
million in September, the survey of oil companies, producers and
analysts showed.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
December was 19.4 percent, up from 19.9 percent yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 518,077
contracts as of 3:22 p.m. It totaled 637,985 contracts
yesterday, 9.8 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.76 million contracts, the least since June 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
