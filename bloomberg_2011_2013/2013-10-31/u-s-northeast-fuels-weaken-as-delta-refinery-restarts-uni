Spot gasoline and diesel fuel
weakened in the U.S. Northeast relative to futures in  New York 
as  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  returned a unit to planned rates at a
Pennsylvania refinery.  Conventional, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in New York
slipped 0.25 cent to 0.75 cent a gallon above futures on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:28 p.m. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel
fell 0.13 cent to reach parity with futures after yesterday
climbing to a premium of 0.13 cent.  Delta, the only airline operating a U.S. refinery,
restarted a fluid catalytic cracker at the 185,000-barrel-a-day
Trainer refinery after shutting the unit Oct. 18 for unplanned
maintenance. An FCC remains shut at Irving Oil Corp.â€™s Saint
John refinery in  New Brunswick .  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a measure of refining
margins for gasoline and diesel based on Brent oil in Europe,
gained 35 cents to $6.51 a barrel, a second consecutive advance,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The spread  on the  Gulf
Coast , based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
dropped $1.66 to $10.66 a barrel.  Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  on the Gulf added 0.75
cent to 20.75 cents a gallon under Nymex futures, ending a four-day decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
