Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  U.S. Chief
Executive Officer  Bill Simon  said that the U.S. should reform
the corporate tax system to encourage companies to invest in the
nation.  “There can’t be an incentive not to bring your money back
to the U.S. or not to invest in the U.S. for American
companies,” Simon said today in an interview with Bloomberg
Television's Trish Regan in Washington. He said that current 
rates haven’t deterred Wal-Mart from spending in the U.S.  Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest private employer, said
earlier today that three of its suppliers would offer 385 new
manufacturing-related jobs in the U.S. as part of its push to
buy an additional $50 billion in domestically made products in
the next 10 years. The vendors produce footwear, curtains and
glassware.  Simon was in Washington for the SelectUSA 2013 Investment
Summit, a gathering to promote investment that was held by the
 Department of Commerce .  Wal-Mart fell 0.2 percent to $76.75 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 12 percent this year, compared with
a 23 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
