Expedia Inc. (EXPE) , an online travel
agency, gained the most since July 2012 after third-quarter
earnings beat analysts’ estimates.  The stock rose 18 percent to $58.97 at the close in New
York, following yesterday’s release of the company’s quarterly
results.  Profit excluding some items rose to $1.43 a share, or $201
million, from $1.32, or $188 million, the year earlier. Analysts
had expected $1.36. Revenue climbed to $1.4 billion, compared
with the $1.38 billion analyst estimate.  Expedia was helped by more people using the service to book
hotel rooms, and by an increase in media and advertising
revenue, the company said in a  statement .  “Earnings were very good and the outlook was very good,”
said Michael Millman, an analyst at Millman Research Associates,
who added that Expedia’s stock is making up for a decline after
the previous quarter’s earning report.  The Bellevue, Washington-based company competes with  Orbitz
Worldwide Inc. (OWW) ,  Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN)  and  TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP)  for
travelers seeking to book trips online.  To contact the reporter on this story:
