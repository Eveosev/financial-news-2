Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,  Colombia ’s largest oil
company, said third-quarter profit rose 20 percent as output
rose to a record even amid a surge in guerrilla attacks.  Consolidated net income rose to 3.86 trillion pesos ($2.05
billion), from 3.23 trillion pesos a year earlier, the Bogota-based company said today in a filing after the market closed.  “We achieved our best financial results of the last six
quarters,” Chief Executive Officer Javier Gutierrez said in the
report. “However, we continue to face a challenging
environment, particularly due to the attacks on transport
infrastructure.”  Production averaged a record 800,400 barrels of oil
equivalent a day in the quarter, mainly due to higher output at
the Chichimene, Apiay, Quifa and Rubiales fields, Gutierrez
said. Ecopetrol is targeting an average daily production of
798,000 barrels in 2013.  Ecopetrol also reported a discovery at the Guainiz-1 well
in the CPO-10 block in the province of Meta, central Colombia.  The company’s oil infrastructure has seen increased rebel
attacks in recent weeks, including several on the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline. There were 147 attacks on Colombia
pipelines January-September 2013, an 18 percent increase from
2012, according to Colombia’s Ministry of Defense website.  Brent crude  averaged $109.65 a barrel in the third quarter,
little changed from $109.42 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
