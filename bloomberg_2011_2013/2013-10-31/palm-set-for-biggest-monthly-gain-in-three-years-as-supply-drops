Palm oil  rose to match an eight-month high, heading for the biggest monthly gain since 2010, on
speculation that rain will disrupt harvests in Malaysia and as a
low-production cycle starts next month.  The contract for delivery in January advanced as much as 1
percent to 2,573 ringgit ($816) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives. That matched yesterday’s intraday peak,
which was the highest level for most-active futures since
February. Futures traded at 2,549 ringgit by 12:02 p.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Palm for physical delivery in November was at 2,540
ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Prices are heading for a 9.9 percent gain this month, the
most since December 2010, on expectation that the monsoon season
that usually begins in November would slow production. While
palm oil is produced year-round,  output  peaks from July to
October in  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest supplier.  “The adverse weather in Malaysia is likely to hamper
production in the upcoming months it may cause some disruption
to harvesting as well as complicate logistics,” Tan Chee Tat,
an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, said by phone in  Singapore .
“Because of the kicking in of the monsoon season and the end of
the high-production cycle, we’re expecting production to slow.”  Isolated showers and thunderstorms are predicted over
Sabah, Sarawak and Johor, the biggest palm oil producing states,
according to a seven-day outlook on the Malaysian Meteorological
Department’s  website . The 14-day relative strength index for
futures was at 73.8, the highest since Aug. 28. Some traders see
readings above 70 as a sign that a drop is imminent.  Refined palm oil for May delivery lost 0.6 percent to 6,294
 yuan  ($1,033) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and  soybean
oil  was unchanged at 7,214 yuan.  Soybeans for delivery in January were little changed at
$12.7575 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean
oil for December fell 0.2 percent to 41.54 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
