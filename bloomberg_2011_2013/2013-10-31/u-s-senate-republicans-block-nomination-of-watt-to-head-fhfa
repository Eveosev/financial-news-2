The  U.S. Senate  voted not to
consider the nomination of Representative Mel Watt, a North
Carolina Democrat, to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency
following resistance from Republicans over his qualifications.  That opposition led to a 56-42 vote against a proposal to
move the nomination to a final debate and floor vote on
President Barack Obamaâ€™s choice to replace Edward J. DeMarco,
who has been acting director since 2009 of the agency that
oversees  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac .  To contact the reporter on this story:
