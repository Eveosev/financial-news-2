Following are comments from Peter Sand, an analyst at the Baltic and International Maritime
Council, a Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based group whose ship-owner
members control about 65 percent of the merchant fleet.  Sand commented by e-mail yesterday about the leaking of
waste into the sea following the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
power station disaster in April 2011:  “Right now, if we can trust the reports we see, hear and
get, shipping is not at risk. However, as the Fukushima accident
has still to come to a stop, it still develops unfortunately.”  “Bimco members were very alert and protected themselves
when the accident happened back in 2011. We received a lot of
requests back then. This time around, owners have dealt with it
as a part of daily operations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
