Boyd Gaming Corp. (BYD) , the operator of
casinos in eight states, fell the most in more than a decade
after reporting an unexpected third-quarter loss and projecting
lower profit this period than analysts estimate.  Boyd declined 19 percent to $10.56 at the close in New
York. That was the  most  since Sept. 17, 2001.  Results deteriorated in many markets last month, Chief
Executive Officer  Keith Smith  said in a statement today. The
loss, excluding some items, totaled 8 cents a share, Las Vegas-based Boyd said. Analysts  expected  profit of 1 cent.  Smith cited improvement in October and encouraging signs in
Las Vegas and  Atlantic City , New Jersey. Still, on a conference
call today, company officials projected a loss this quarter of
15 cents to 20 cents a share. Analysts estimate a loss of 4
cents, the average of 16 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
