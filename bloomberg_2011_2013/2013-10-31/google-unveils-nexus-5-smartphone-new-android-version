Google Inc. (GOOG)  unveiled a new
smartphone using the latest Android operating system designed
for a more global user base, seeking to curtail fragmentation
caused by different versions of the software.  The Nexus 5, made by  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , will be available
for $349 to $399, depending on memory,  Sundar Pichai , senior
vice president, said at a press event in San Francisco today.
The new KitKat version of Android features better search,
improved security and more immersive displays, he said. The
mobile operating system is also easier to use on lower-end
phones that are popular in  emerging markets  such as India,
Indonesia and Brazil.  Google, operator of the world’s most-popular search engine,
is stepping up efforts to promote Android-enabled devices around
the world as people turn to smartphones and tablets to check e-mail, browse the Web and find entertainment. The new version
includes improvements to Google Now, which anticipates
information that users may want or need, and has improvements in
voice search that make it more interactive and accurate.  “For 2014, our goal is how do we reach the next billion
people,” Pichai said. “That’s a major theme of KitKat.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
