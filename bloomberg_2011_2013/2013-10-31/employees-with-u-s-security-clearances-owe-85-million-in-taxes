Thousands of federal employees and
contractors approved for security clearances from 2006 to 2011
owed $85 million in unpaid federal taxes, according to a  report 
released today by congressional investigators.  The Government Accountability Office said half of the 8,400
individuals who owed taxes had made arrangements with the
Internal Revenue Service to settle their tax debts. About 4,700
were employees and the rest worked for contractors.  Debts ranged from $100 to more than $2 million. The money
was owed as of June 2012.  The GAO looked at individuals who were approved for
clearances from April 1, 2006, to Dec. 31, 2011, and those who
held the designation before then. Three-fourths of those who
owed taxes didn’t become delinquent until after they received
their clearances, the report said.  Senator Tom Coburn of  Oklahoma , the ranking Republican on
the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, said
action is needed to prevent those owing back taxes from getting
security clearances.  “Giving security clearances to individuals that fail to
follow the law is unwise and unnecessarily puts our nation’s
classified information at risk,” Coburn said in a statement.
“Federal tax cheats with security clearances are double threats
that jeopardize both our national and economic security.”  Almost 700 IRS contractor employees owed $5.4 million in
taxes, according to a report released Oct. 23 by the  Treasury
Inspector General for Tax Administration . The report said 339 of
the 691 contractors that owed taxes had agreed to plans to erase
their debts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
