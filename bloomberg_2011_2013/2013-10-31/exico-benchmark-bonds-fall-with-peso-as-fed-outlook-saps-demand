Yields on  Mexico ’s peso bonds rose
for a fourth day on speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve
may move sooner than some investors expected to curtail monetary
stimulus that has boosted demand for emerging-market assets.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.02 percent at 9:20 a.m. in Mexico
City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The move left the
yield down 0.06 percentage point for the month. The currency
fell 0.4 percent to 12.9862 per  U.S. dollar , paring its gain
this month to 0.9 percent.  While the Fed pledged yesterday to maintain the pace of its
$85 billion a month of securities purchases, policy makers said
they saw signs of “underlying strength” in economic activity.
The selloff began last week when  Banco de Mexico  signaled it
wouldn’t cut rates further.  The Fed was “less dovish than expected,” said Alejandro Urbina, who helps oversee $800 million including Mexico
government peso bonds at Silva Capital Management in  Chicago ,
said in a e-mailed response to questions.  Mexico policy makers said Oct. 25 that more cuts weren’t
advisable as they lowered the target lending rate by 0.25
percentage point to 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
