Roma became the first team to win its
opening 10 games in Italian soccer’s Serie A as Marco
Borriello’s header secured a 1-0 victory over last-place Chievo.  Borriello scored his first league goal since May 2011 last
night to restore Roma’s five-point lead atop the standings over
Napoli and Juventus, who both won two days ago.  Roma, which has scored 24 goals and allowed one in taking a
perfect 30 points from 10 games, had matched the nine wins in a
row to start a campaign set in 2005-06 by Juventus. The Turin-based club was later stripped of that championship and the
previous season’s for its role in a match-fixing scandal.  Midfielder Alessandro Florenzi set up Roma’s goal in the
67th minute after coming on as a substitute. His volleyed center
from the left was headed in by Borriello from six yards.  In  Spain , Diego Costa and  David Villa  each scored with a
penalty kick as  Atletico Madrid  won 2-1 at Granada to move back
to within a point of Barcelona at the top of La Liga.  Brazil-born Costa, who this week declared his intention to
play for the Spanish national team, opened the scoring from the
spot for his league-leading 12th goal of the season. Villa made
it 2-0 with 12 minutes remaining before Odion Ighalo pulled a
goal back for Granada.  Defending champion Barcelona, which has 31 points from 11
games, hosts city rival Espanyol today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
