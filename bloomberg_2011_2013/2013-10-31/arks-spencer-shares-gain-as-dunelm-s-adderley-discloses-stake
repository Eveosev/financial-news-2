(Corrects to show Bill, not Will, Adderley bought the
stake and removes references to Will.)  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , Britain’s
largest clothing retailer, gained in  London  after disclosing
that a founder of the Dunelm homeware chain took his stake in
the company above 3 percent.  The  shares  advanced 2.1 percent to 503.5 pence, the highest
closing price since Sept. 24.  Bill Adderley owns about 48.5 million Marks & Spencer
shares, the London-based retailer said today. The stake, worth
about 247 million pounds ($396 million) at current prices, makes
him the company’s  seventh-largest investor .  Adderley has held a stake in M&S for at least 18 months and
his holding recently breached the 3 percent disclosure
threshold, said a person familiar with the matter, who asked not
to be identified because the information isn’t public. An M&S
spokesman declined to comment beyond the statement.  Dunelm has a market value of about 1.8 billion pounds.  “He’s brave to take such a big punt on an M&S recovery,”
 Nick Bubb , an independent retail analyst in London, said in an
e-mail.  Marks & Spencer’s general-merchandise sales have fallen for
eight straight quarters. Chief Executive Officer  Marc Bolland  is
expanding the company’s food and online offering, while adding
international stores as clothing sales struggle at home. The
retailer is due to report first-half earnings Nov. 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
