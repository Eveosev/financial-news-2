Saracens center Joel Tomkins was
selected to make his  England  rugby debut against  Australia  at
Twickenham this weekend.  London Irish wing Marland Yarde will make his second
appearance, his first at Twickenham, while Billy Vunipola, who’s
played twice for England, was chosen at No. 8. Lee Dickson was
picked ahead of Ben Youngs at scrum-half for the Nov. 2 game.  “I’m delighted for Joel,” England coach  Stuart Lancaster 
said on the  Rugby Football Union website . “He has had a great
week’s training and is ready for his chance. He has played in
many high-profile games in his career so far and has a great
temperament for the big occasion.”  For Australia, Ben Mowen takes over as captain from  James Horwill . The selectors said they made the decision so that lock
Horwill “can focus entirely on bringing his ‘A’ game.”  Matt Toomua was chosen ahead of Christian Lealiifano at
inside center while wing Nick Cummins and flanker Scott Fardy
return from injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
