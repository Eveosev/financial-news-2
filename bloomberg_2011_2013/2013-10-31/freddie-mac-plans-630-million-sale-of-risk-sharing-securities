Freddie Mac , the government-controlled mortgage-finance company, is planning its second sale
of notes tied to the risk of homeowner defaults.  The deal will include $245 million of securities that Fitch
Ratings plans to assign BBB- rankings, the credit grader said
today in a presale report. A riskier $385 million portion will
be unrated. Both have floating rates and mature in 10 years.  U.S. regulators see sales of the debt by McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  and competitor  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  as a way to reduce
the roles of the two taxpayer-backed companies and assess
whether they are charging enough to guarantee their traditional
mortgage bonds. The latest transaction will be tied to $35.3
billion of loans originated in the fourth quarter of 2012 and
this yearâ€™s first quarter that have already been packaged into
other Freddie Mac securities, according to Fitch.  The risk-sharing deals also resemble provisions in
legislation introduced this year that would overhaul the $9.3
trillion U.S. mortgage-finance system. The bill, by Senators  Bob Corker , a Republican from Tennessee and Democrat Mark Warner of
Virginia, was praised by President Barack Obama.  Freddie Mac sold $500 million of similar debt in July and
Fannie Mae completed its inaugural, $600 million deal this
month. Relative yields on the bonds have since declined,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG analysts.  Patti Boerger, a Freddie Mac spokeswoman, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
