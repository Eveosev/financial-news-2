One person died and five people are
missing after a tunnel operated by Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.
collapsed near Ladysmith, South Africa, the state-owned utility
said in an e-mailed statement.  A rescue operation is underway at the site in the coastal
KwaZulu-Natal province, Eskom said in the statement. About 15
people were working at the power utility’s Ingula pumped storage
project when scaffolding collapsed early today, Eskom spokesman
Andrew Etzinger said by phone.  “A working platform failed and several people were
injured,” the company said in a statement. “We have five
people unaccounted for, with one confirmed fatality.”  The Ingula hydro-power project is currently under
construction and was expected to start operations next year.
It’s one of three new facilities that will expand Eskom’s
production by more than 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
