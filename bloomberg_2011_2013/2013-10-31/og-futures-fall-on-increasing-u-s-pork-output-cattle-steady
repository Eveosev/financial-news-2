Hogs fell for the third straight day
on concern that climbing U.S. pork supplies will outpace
domestic and overseas demand. Cattle were little changed.  Meatpackers slaughtered 1.29 million hogs in the first
three days this week, 1.5 percent more than a year earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  Exporters  shipped 3.254
billion pounds (1.48 million metric tons) of pork in the eight
months through Aug. 31, down 8.6 percent from a year earlier,
the latest USDA data show. Carcass  weights  have increased for
two straight months, according to government figures.  “The slaughter numbers are starting to grow,”  Don Roose ,
the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa ,
said in a telephone interview. “Weights are up.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.8 percent to
89.675 cents a pound at 10:55 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Through yesterday, prices climbed 4.4 percent this
month.  Cattle futures for December delivery dropped 0.1 percent to
$1.3305 a pound on the CME. The most-active contract increased 1
percent this month.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement slid 0.3
percent to $1.645 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
