Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) , owner of the Invesco,
Perpetual and PowerShares funds, said third-quarter profit rose
34 percent as clients deposited money and a stock-market rally
lifted assets.  Net income increased to $228.1 million, or 51 cents a
share, from $170.6 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier,
Atlanta-based Invesco said today in a statement. Excluding
certain items, earnings of 55 cents a share beat the average
 estimate  of 52 cents in a Bloomberg survey of 20 analysts.  Chief Executive Officer Martin Flanagan, 53, has invested
in distribution outside the U.S. and made acquisitions to
diversify the mix of products and client base. That helped
shield the firm as investors pulled $14 billion from the
nation’s mutual funds in the third quarter, driven by a flight
from bonds, according to estimates from the  Investment Company
Institute . Invesco attracted a net $9.1 billion in the quarter,
and gathered another $3 billion in October, Chief Financial
Officer Loren Starr said today in a telephone interview.  Client deposits were “better than expected in the quarter
as active equity flows continue to gather momentum,” Daniel Fannon, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in  San Francisco , wrote
today in a note to clients.  Invesco rose 3.2 percent to $33.97 at 10:15 a.m. in  New
York . The shares had risen 26 percent through yesterday,
compared with a 36 percent gain by Standard & Poor’s 20-company
 index  for asset managers and custody banks.  Excluding money-market funds, Invesco gathered $5.8 billion
in new client money in the quarter, including $4.8 billion to
actively managed products. Equity investments took in $4.6
billion, while alternatives led by  bank loan  and real estate
products attracted $1.4 billion. Bond products lost $1.1 billion
to withdrawals.  ‘Strong Quarter’  “It was a very strong quarter, and we think the trends are
still in place for increasing margins,” Invesco’s Starr said
today.  Revenue in the third quarter climbed 16 percent to $1.17
billion, driven by an equivalent rise in investment management
fees. Expenses rose at a slower pace, increasing 10 percent to
$886 million, as employee compensation rose 4.8 percent.  Invesco’s assets increased 5.7 percent in the quarter to
$745.5 billion and 12 percent in the year ended Sept. 30. The
MSCI ACWI Index of global stocks rose 7.4 percent in the quarter
and 15 percent in the year through Sept. 30.  Invesco’s board of directors authorized management to
repurchase $1.5 billion of additional shares with no expiration
date. The company didn’t repurchase any shares in the third
quarter.  Atlantic Trust  Assets under management exclude money run by Atlantic Trust
Private Wealth Management, the unit Invesco agreed in April to
sell to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,  Canada ’s fifth-largest bank, for $210 million. Atlantic Trust managed $21.7
billion as of June 30. The companies said at the time they
expected to complete the deal in the second half of 2013.  Invesco may see client defections next year with the
departure of 25-year veteran fund manager Neil Woodford, Kim
said. The company said Oct. 15 that Woodford, 53, who oversees
the U.K.’s largest equity fund, will leave its Invesco Perpetual
unit in  London  on April 29 to set up his own company.  Woodford oversees about 33 billion pounds ($53 billion),
including the 14 billion pound  Invesco Perpetual High Income
Fund. (INVHIIA)  The fund has returned 14 percent annually in the past
three years, outperforming 76 percent of competitors.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest asset manager, said
Oct. 16 its third-quarter net income rose 14 percent to $730
million. Investors deposited a net $25 billion, driven by flows
to equity exchange-traded funds.  T. Rowe Price Group Inc. said Oct. 24 its third-quarter net
income rose 9 percent to $267.7 million after clients withdrew a
net $7.4 billion, marking the second straight quarter of
redemptions for the Baltimore-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
