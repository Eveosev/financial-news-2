The U.K. will make public a central
register on beneficial ownership of companies as part of a
government drive to crack down on tax evasion, Prime Minister
David Cameron will say today.  The measures aim to prevent keeping ownership of companies
secret through the use of nominees, Cameron will say in a speech
to the Open Government Partnership Summit in  London , according
to extracts released by his office. The existence of shell
companies has led to a “cloak of secrecy” that hides ownership
and money flows, he will say.  “To keep corporate taxes low, you’ve got to  keep corporate
taxes coming in,”  Cameron will say. “We need to shine a
spotlight on who owns what and where money is really flowing.”  The Institute of Directors lobby group welcomed the
decision, with Director of Corporate Governance Roger Barker
adding that challenges remain to make the register accurate and
robust.  To contact the reporter on this story:
