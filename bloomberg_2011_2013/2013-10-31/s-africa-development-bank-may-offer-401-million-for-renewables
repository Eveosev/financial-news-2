The Development Bank of South Africa
may offer as much as 4 billion rand ($401 million) in additional
funding for the government’s renewable energy program.  “It is early to tell, but we are looking at an addition of
about 3 to 4 billion rand for the third and subsequent rounds,”
Cyprian Marowa, general manager for infrastructure finance at
DBSA, said in an interview at a biogas conference in Midrand
yesterday. The bank supplied 6.7 billion rand for the first and
second rounds, he said.  South Africa began awarding contracts to build wind, solar
and biomass plants after chronic electricity shortages led to
the suspension of mines and factories in 2008. The renewable-energy drive seeks to cut reliance on coal, which fires 80
percent of power generation.  “There are two kinds of citizens, those with an option to
just hit the switch and get power and then there are those
without an option in rural areas,” Marowa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
