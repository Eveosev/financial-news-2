U.S. stocks were little changed as
consumer-discretionary and technology shares led gains, helping
the market recover from early losses triggered by concern the
 Federal Reserve  may taper monetary stimulus in coming months.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up less than 0.1
percent at 1,763.76 at 11:37 a.m. in  New York  after slipping as
much as 0.4 percent earlier.  The  S&P 500  fell 0.5 percent from a record yesterday,
halting four days of gains, as the Fed fueled bets it may begin
to cut stimulus in the coming months. The central bank
maintained $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, saying that
while the economy shows signs of “underlying strength” it
needs to see more evidence of sustainable improvement.  Economists at Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc said
yesterday’s Fed policy statement opens the possibility of
reduced bond purchases as soon as December. The odds of a taper
in January rose to 45 percent, from 25 percent before the
decision, according to Citigroup. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg Oct. 17-18 had predicted the Fed would begin paring
stimulus in March.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
