The U.S. Treasury Department changed
the rule for health flexible spending arrangements to permit a
carry-over of $500 in unused balances remaining at the end of a
plan year.  The Treasury issued a notice modifying the “use-or-lose”
rule for health flexible spending arrangements to make the
program “more consumer-friendly,” according to an e-mailed
statement from the department today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
