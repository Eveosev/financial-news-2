Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802) , Japan’s
biggest developer by market value, said net income rose 76
percent as profit margins improved in its residential business.  Net income gained to 43.6 billion yen ($443 million) in the
six months ended Sept. 30 from 24.8 billion yen a year earlier,
the company said in a statement to the  Tokyo Stock Exchange (1345) 
today. Sales climbed 10 percent to 481 billion yen.  Mitsubishi Estate is enjoying last-minute buying demand
ahead of a consumption tax increase in April. The number of
apartments offered for sale in Tokyo and surrounding areas will
rise to as many as 55,000 units this year, the highest level
since 2007, according to an estimate by the Real Estate Economic
Research Institute Co.  The Tokyo-based developer kept its profit forecast at 58
billion yen for the year ending March 31, on sales of 1.07
trillion yen.  Japan  plans to double the sales tax rate to 10 percent from
5 percent by 2015, with the first increase to 8 percent
scheduled in April next year to tackle the nation’s swelling
debt.  The developer sold 1,852 apartments in the first half,
compared with 1,847 units sold in the same period last year,
according to the statement. Operating profit, or sales minus the
cost of goods, at its residential business gained 47 percent to
4.3 billion yen in the period from 2.9 billion yen a year
earlier, it said.  Office Business  Mitsubishi Estate said last month that it sold all 22
apartment units that cost as much as 542 million yen near the
Imperial Palace.  Operating profit at the sales and office leasing businesses
fell 9.9 percent to 53.2 billion yen, the company said.  Mitsubishi Estate’s shares were 1.4 percent lower at 2,797
yen at the close of trading in  Tokyo , following the earnings
announcement.  Mitsubishi Estate is in its second 10-year redevelopment
plan for the Marunouchi business district, which helps generate
more than 90 percent of the company’s profit.  Marunouchi is Tokyo’s most expensive office area and home
to companies such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
