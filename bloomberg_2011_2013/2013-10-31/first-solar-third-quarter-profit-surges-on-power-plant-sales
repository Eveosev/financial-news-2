First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest U.S.
solar-panel manufacturer, said third-quarter profit almost
doubled on sales of power plants and revenue from new projects.  Net income rose to $195 million, or $1.94 a share, from
$87.9 million, or $1, a year earlier, Tempe, Arizona-based First
Solar said today in a statement. The company was expected to
earn 83 cents, the average of 12 analystsâ€™ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 51 percent to $1.27 billion.  Profit rose as First Solar recorded about half the revenue
it expects to receive from its Desert Sunlight project in
 Southern California  and sold plants that it built in  Canada , the
company said in a statement. The company in August said it
expected to record about a third of the 550-megawatt Desert
Sunlight project revenue this year.  For the year, First Solar reduced its sales guidance to
$3.4 billion to $3.6 billion from an August expectation of $3.6
billion to $3.8 billion. Cost reductions will help boost 2013
net income to $4.25 to $4.50 a share, up from a prior estimate
of $3.75 to $4.25.  First Solar rose 9 percent to $54.81 at 5 p.m. in  New York .
The shares have more than doubled in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
