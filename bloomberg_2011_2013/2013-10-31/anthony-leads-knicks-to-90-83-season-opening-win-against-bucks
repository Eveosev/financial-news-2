Carmelo Anthony scored 19 points as
the New York Knicks opened their National Basketball Association
season with a 90-83 victory at home against the Milwaukee Bucks.  The defending-champion Miami Heat lost to the Philadelphia
76ers 114-110, and the revamped Brooklyn Nets lost to the
Cleveland Cavaliers 98-94.  The Knicks had a 56-31 halftime lead last night in New York
before they were outscored 52-34 in the second half. It was the
first regular-season NBA game in Madison Square Garden since the
completion of a $1 billion renovation that took three years.  Elsewhere in the NBA, it was Toronto 93, Boston 87; Detroit
113, Washington 102; Houston 96,  Charlotte  83; Minnesota 120,

Bucks, followed by Caron Butler with 14 points and Zaza Pachulia
with 13 points and 11 rebounds. O.J. Mayo also scored 13 points.  In Philadelphia, the 76ers defeated the Heat behind rookie
Michael Carter-Williams, who had 22 points, 12 assists and nine
steals. LeBron James had 25 points and 13 assists for Miami.
Nevada sports books predict a historically bad season for the
76ers, listing their win total at 16.5, as they vie for the top
pick in the next NBA draft. The Heat won the past two NBA
titles.  The Nets, who acquired All-Stars Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, lost in  Cleveland  as Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving
had 15 points and nine assists. Pierce had 17 points, while
