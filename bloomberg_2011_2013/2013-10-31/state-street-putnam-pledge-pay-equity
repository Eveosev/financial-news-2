State Street Corp. (STT) , the third-largest custody bank, and Putnam Investments LLC were among 39
companies that pledged to report pay-equity data to  Boston  as of
way of assessing the earning gap between men and women.  “We are doing this because it is important to the city,”
Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democrat, said today at a  City Hall  news
briefing. “We haven’t shied away from big issues in the past.
Boston started the American Revolution.”  The voluntary compact requires the firms to assess pay
equity and report those findings every two years to the Women’s
Workforce Committee at City Hall, said Cathy Mineham, the
chairman of the committee. The data will be reported
collectively, so it won’t be clear what the pay gap is at an
individual company, she said.  In Boston, women earn 85 percent of what their male peers
take home, according to Menino’s office. Over 40 years, a woman
will earn $380,000 less than a man on average, according to the
city.  In his state-of-the-city address in January, Menino, 70,
pledged to make 2013 the “year of the woman.” He announced in
March that he won’t seek an unprecedented sixth year and will
leave office in January.  Other companies pledging to participate include  Vertex
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX) ; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts;
 Raytheon Co. (RTN) ; and Finagle a Bagel, a local eatery, according to
Menino’s office.  --Mark Schoifet, William Glasgall  To contact the reporter on this story:
