Bega Cheese Ltd. (BGA) , the under bidder in
a three-way contest for an Australian peer, rose to a record in
Sydney trading after  New Zealand ’s Fonterra Cooperative Group
acquired a 6 percent stake.  Bega jumped as much as 12 percent, before trading 8.6
percent higher at A$4.79 at 10:17 a.m. local time. Fonterra, the
world’s largest dairy exporter, said it paid A$4.95 a share for
a 6 percent stake in New South Wales state-based Bega after the
market closed yesterday.  The purchase raised the value of Bega’s cash and share
offer for  Warrnambool Cheese & Butter Factory Co. (WCB)  to a peak of
A$7.93, just 7 cents less than the current highest bid from
Montreal-based  Saputo Inc. (SAP)  Murray Goulburn Cooperative Co. is
also bidding for Warrnambool.  “There has recently been a lot of consolidation activity
in the Australian  dairy industry ,” Fonterra Chief Executive
Officer Theo Spierings said today in a statement. “It is
important that Fonterra participates, and we have confidence in
Bega and the strategy it is pursuing.”  Bega’s board is meeting next week to discuss raising its
offer for Warrnambool after its proposal was cleared yesterday
by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Chairman
Barry Irvin said in an interview yesterday. Bega had climbed 40
percent at the close of trading yesterday since it made a
takeover bid on Sept. 12 for the maker of brands including
Sungold milk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
