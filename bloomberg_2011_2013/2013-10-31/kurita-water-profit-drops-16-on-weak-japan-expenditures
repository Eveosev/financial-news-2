Kurita Water Industries Ltd. (6370) , a
Tokyo water-systems provider, said profit fell 16 percent in the
first half, hurt by weak  capital expenditures  among
manufacturers in  Japan .  Net income declined to 4.1 billion yen ($41.8 million) in
the six months ended Sept. 30 from 4.9 billion yen a year
earlier, the company said today in a filing. Revenue fell 8.3
percent to 82.8 billion yen.  Kuritaâ€™s major products and services suffered from a slow
recovery in capacity utilization and weak expenditure among
Japanese manufacturers, its main customers, the company said.
Capital expenditures on water-treatment facilities were canceled
or postponed in the electronic industry overseas.  The company on Oct. 11 reduced its forecast for full-year
net income and revenue to 9 billion yen and 176 billion yen.
Kurita makes and sells water-treatment equipment and products
including water-purification and soil remediation systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
