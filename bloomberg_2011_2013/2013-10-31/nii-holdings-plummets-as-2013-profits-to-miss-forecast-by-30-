NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , which sells
Nextel wireless service in  Latin America , fell to a 10-year low
after saying it will miss its forecast for 2013 profit by 30
percent or more.  Weaker-than-expected results and the depreciation of
currencies in Latin America will cause the shortfall, Reston,
Virginia-based NII said today in a statement. The company will
miss its target for $600 million to $650 million in operating
income by at least $200 million, it said.  NII is struggling to hold on to subscribers as competitors
such as  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  and  Telefonica SA (TEF)  offer faster
download speeds for smartphones. The company lost 178,000
customers in the third quarter to end with 9.7 million.  Bond prices also sank following the report. The company’s
$800 million of 10 percent senior unsecured notes due August
2016 dropped 7 cents to 78 cents on the dollar, the lowest
closing level since the securities were issued in April 2010,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Yields on the notes
climbed to 20.8 percent, up from this year’s low of 8.4 percent
in May.  The third-quarter net loss from continuing operations
widened to $293.1 million, or $1.70 a share, from $61.7 million,
or 36 cents, a year earlier. Sales slumped 22 percent to $1.1
billion, missing the $1.22 billion average estimate of analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  NII shares fell 29 percent in  New York  trading, the biggest
one-day drop on record, to $3.43. That’s its lowest closing
price since March 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
