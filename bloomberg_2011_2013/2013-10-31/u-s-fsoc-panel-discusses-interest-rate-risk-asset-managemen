 The U.S. Financial Stability
Oversight Council discussed interest-rate risk and asset
management at a meeting in  Washington  today, Treasury Department
spokeswoman Suzanne Elio said in an e-mailed statement.  The council’s discussion of asset management follows a
study by the Office of Financial Research on the industry. Asset
managers are among the companies that the council, led by
Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, can evaluate to determine
whether they need to be supervised by the Federal Reserve.  The council also “received an update on analyses related
to interest rate risk,” according to the statement. The FSOC
was created by the Dodd-Frank law to coordinate policies among
regulators to help avoid another financial crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
