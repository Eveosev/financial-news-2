Two of America’s best known
investors are moving in opposite directions in the stock market,
with Laszlo Birinyi predicting more gains as  David Einhorn  takes
a more cautious approach.  Holdings that profit if stocks gain at Einhorn’s Greenlight
Capital Re Ltd.’s exceeded short bets by 35 percentage points as
of Sept. 30, compared with about 42 percentage points three
months earlier, he said today on a conference call.Birinyi,
president of Birinyi Associates Inc., said the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index will reach 1,820 by February and bought calls that
profit from a rally in equity benchmark.  The divide is widening between Birinyi, whose bullish
forecasts have proved prescient during a 4 1/2-year bull market,
and Einhorn, who gained fame betting against Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. Stocks in the U.S are in the midst of their
broadest advance on record, a rally that has burned short
sellers and pushed valuations to the highest levels since 2010
as the  S&P 500 (SPX)  reaches all-time highs.  “As the market continued its relentless climb, we’ve
become more conservatively positioned,” said Einhorn, a hedge-fund manager and chairman of Greenlight Re, a Cayman Islands-based reinsurer.  Stocks climbed this year as earnings exceeded analyst
forecasts, unemployment declined and the  Federal Reserve 
continued its economic stimulus program. The  S&P 500  has gained
4.9 percent in October, bringing the advance for the year to 24
percent, the most since 2003. The advance has pushed the price-earnings ratio up almost 20 percent to 16.7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Call Options  Birinyi predicts a 3.2 percent advance to 1,820 in the next
three months, according to a report today. His firm purchased
calls on the  SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)  with a strike price at $182
that expire in January 2014. The exchange-traded fund closed at
$176.29 yesterday. The S&P 500 was little changed at 1,764.73 at
1:47 p.m. in  New York .  Einhorn said most of the portfolio gain in the third
quarter was from long holdings in companies including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
He said he was sticking with his short positions, or wagers that
a stock will decline, including one on Green Mountain Coffee
Roasters Inc.  “The losses in the short book were broad-based, and we
continue to be short most of the companies that contributed to
the loss,” he said. “These include a variety of companies
which tend to have conventional valuations, rather than
speculative story stocks that have caused excessive pain for
other short sellers.”  Investment Returns  Greenlight Re’s investment portfolio returned 4 percent in
the third quarter and 12 percent in the first nine months of the
year, the company said yesterday in a filing. That compares with
 5.2 percent  and 20 percent for the S&P 500, including dividends.
The reinsurer’s portfolio was valued at $1.15 billion as of
Sept. 30.  Einhorn, 44, has sounded alarms about the climb in asset
prices for months. Last year he compared excessive stimulus by
central bankers with eating too many jelly donuts, a habit that
can be a threat to long-term health, according to an article
that quoted him in Grant’s Interest Rate Observer.  Birinyi’s 1,820 forecast comes after he said in August the
S&P 500 would reach 1,740 by the end of the year. He projected
in January that the index had more than a 50 percent chance of
reaching 1,600 in 2013. The gauge surpassed 1,600 in May and
1,740 this month.  Unexpected Obstacles  “We took it on a step-by-step basis expecting some detours
and unexpected obstacles, which did occur,” Birinyi wrote.  The S&P 500 has a 51 percent chance of reaching the new
forecast by Jan. 31 and a 75 percent chance of doing so by March
31, according to today’s note.  Birinyi has stuck to his bullish projections since the
rally began. He said the  bull market  was intact in August 2011
when S&P’s downgrade of the U.S.’s AAA credit rating helped send
the index down almost 20 percent.  He cautioned investors not to “get shaken out” in May
2012, as stocks lost 9.9 percent. This year represents the
fourth and final phase of the rally, during which gains
accelerate as investors pile in, Birinyi said.  The index will drop to 1,718 by year’s end, according to
the average of 19 Wall Street strategist projections compiled by
Bloomberg, whose estimates range from 1,440 to 1,800.  To contact the reporters on this story:
