Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai headed for a monthly loss amid concern that demand for
the building material will be weak in winter ahead.  Rebar for delivery in May, the most-active contract by
volume on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, fell as much as 0.4
percent to 3,630  yuan  ($596) a metric ton, before trading at
3,638 yuan at 10:16 a.m. local time. The contract lost 1.4
percent this month.  “Seasonality dictates that demand for rebar is usually
weak in the winter, although some people might hope that could
be partly offset by inventory replenishing,” said Wu Zhili, an
analyst at Shenhua Futures Co. in Shenzhen.  Iron ore  futures for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange fell 0.2 percent to 922 yuan a ton.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port, tracked by
the Steel Index, was little changed yesterday at $131.20 a dry
ton.  The spot price of rebar advanced 0.2 percent to 3,489 yuan
a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
