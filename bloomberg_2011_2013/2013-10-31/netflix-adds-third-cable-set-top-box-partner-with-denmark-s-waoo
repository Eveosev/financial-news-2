Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  added Denmark’s Waoo!
to the pay-television partners that offer the world’s largest
subscription streaming service on set-top boxes.  Waoo!’s pay-TV customers will gain on-screen access to
Netflix through their existing video service, the companies said
today in a statement. The company, operator of an fiber-optic
network, has a total of 270,000 customers.  Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, has already signed
up cable-TV operator Virgin Media and Sweden’s Com Hem to offer
access to its films and television shows on their pay-television
services. The company also wants to sign up U.S. cable
operators, Chief Financial Officer  David Wells  said last month
at an investor conference in New York.  Netflix rose 1.4 percent to $322.48 at the close in New
York. The shares have more than tripled this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
