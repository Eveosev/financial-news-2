Mitsui & Co. (8031) , a Japanese trading
company, bought a 20.6 percent stake in a $1 billion power
station in New York City from GDF Suez of  France .  The project will supply electricity from the 575-megawatt
gas-fired power plant to a unit of  Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED) 
until May 2016, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement on
its website. After that, it will sell power to the city’s
electricity market.  The deal is part of an effort to deepen its global alliance
with GDF Suez in electricity and liquefied natural gas, Mitsui
said. The Japanese company is also expanding in U.S. shale gas
production, LNG exports and petrochemicals manufacturing.  The Astoria power plant in New York started commercial
operation in May 2006, Mitsui said.  GDF Suez (GSZ)  will now hold a 38
percent stake in the project and three local investors the
remaining 41.4 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
