The ruble pared a second month of
gains as investors speculated the U.S. will reduce stimulus
sooner than expected, curbing demand for riskier assets.  The Russian currency weakened less than 0.1 percent to
37.3714 against Bank Rossii’s basket of dollars and euros by
2:27 p.m. in Moscow. The yield on government bonds due February
2027 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.54
percent.  Emerging-market assets dropped after the Fed maintained $85
billion in monthly bond purchases yesterday, saying that while
the economy shows signs of “underlying strength” it needs to
see more evidence of sustainable improvement. The ruble headed
for a 0.4 percent monthly gain against the basket, extending its
1.5 percent advance in September and paring the year-to-date
decline to 6.8 percent.  “The ruble’s performance in November will to a large
extent depend on the evolution of the Fed’s tapering
expectations,” Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief economist for  Russia 
at Bank of America in Moscow, said in e-mailed comments.  The yield on government bonds due 2027 declined 10 basis
points for the month after dropping 37 percent in September. The
Finance Ministry sold out four out of five auctions it held this
month, issuing 139 billion rubles ($4.3 billion) of notes in
total.  Russian central bank policy makers will meet on Nov. 8 to
discuss policy rates. On Oct. 14 the regulator left its main
lending rate unchanged for a 13th month and removed a signal
that it will keep monetary policy on pause as inflation dropped
into its target range for the first time since August 2012.  Rate Cuts  “The ruble can also come under pressure if the central
bank responds to the surprising economic weakness and starts
cutting policy rates,” Osakovskiy said. “We expect at least
one 25 basis-point cut before the year-end.”  The ruble fell 0.2 percent against the dollar to 32.0695
and advanced 0.1 percent against the euro to 43.8550.  Oil, Russia’s main export earner, declined 0.3 percent to
$109.52 a barrel in  London . An index of the 20 most-active
emerging-country currencies fell for the fourth day, losing 0.2
percent to 94.9643, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The excessive decline in Russian assets has already been
bought out,” Vladimir Kolychev, chief economist for Russia at
VTB Capital in Moscow, said by e-mail. “The most probable
scenario is the sideways trading in the next month with a little
strengthening drift.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
