William Eggers, the research 
director at Deloitte and co-author with Paul MacMillan of "The 
Solution Revolution: How Business, Government, and Social 
Enterprises are Teaming Up to Solve Society's Toughest 
Problems", says in today's era of fiscal constraints and 
political gridlock, government alone cannot tackle towering 
social problems.  He outlines ways private citizens and 
companies are engineering real change.  Eggers talks with 
Bloomberg's  Kathleen Hays  and Vonnie Quinn on Bloomberg Radio's 
"The Hays Advantage."  (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 17:18
