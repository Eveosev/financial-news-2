MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said it will weigh challenging any designation as a
systemically important financial institution after smaller rival
Prudential Financial Inc. abandoned its fight over the label.  “We are not ruling out any of the remedies available under
Dodd-Frank to contest a SIFI designation,”  Steven Kandarian ,
chief executive officer of New York-based MetLife, said today in
a conference call.  Prudential this month opted against filing a lawsuit
seeking to overturn the label as a non-bank SIFI. The tag was
imposed by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which
counts Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew as chairman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
