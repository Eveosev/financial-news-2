BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc., the
retailer which was taken private by  Leonard Green  & Partners LLP
and  CVC Capital Partners  in a 2011 buyout, is refinancing debt
and increasing borrowings to pay a $450 million dividend,
according to  Standard & Poor’s .  A $1.45 billion first lien loan will pay interest at 3.75
percentage points or 4 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, with a 1 percent floor on the lending
benchmark, according to a person with knowledge of the offering,
who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set. A $650
million second-lien portion will pay interest at 7.75 percentage
points or 8 percentage points more than Libor, also with a 1
percent floor on the benchmark, the person said.  The new debt will have the same maturity as the  existing
covenant-light loans  coming due in 2019 and 2020, which totaled
$1.625 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BJ’s  credit rating  was cut to six levels below investment
grade to B- from B by S&P, and down to an equivalent B3 by
Moody’s Investors Service.  The Westborough, Massachusetts-based company, which was
taken private for about $2.8 billion, is paying a higher rate to
refinance its first-lien debt, Bloomberg data show.  Its 2019 $1.3 billion loan pays interest at 4.25 percent,
Bloomberg data show. The interest on the second-lien portion may
be reduced by 1 percentage point.  Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, Morgan
Stanley and Jefferies Group Inc. arranged the financing, the
person said.  Michael Gennaro, a spokesman for Los Angeles-based Leonard
Green, didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking a
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
