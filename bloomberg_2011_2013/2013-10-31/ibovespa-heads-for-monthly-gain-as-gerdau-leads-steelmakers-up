The Ibovespa headed for a fourth
monthly advance, its longest winning streak since 2009, as
 Gerdau SA (GGBR4)  led steelmakers higher after reporting quarterly
earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA  climbed after HSBC
Holdings Plc raised its recommendation on the steelmaker to the
equivalent of buy. Retailer  Magazine Luiza SA (MGLU3)  jumped after
reporting third-quarter net income that was 52 percent more than
Banco Itau BBA SA had forecast. Plane builder  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  dropped
after its earnings trailed analysts’ estimates.  The Ibovespa was up 3.7 percent this month as of 4:37 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, with the equity gauge climbing 0.2 percent to
54,295.83 today. The real slumped 1.8 percent to 2.2310 per  U.S.
dollar . Steelmakers gained as a weaker currency made imports
more expensive and the industry more competitive.  “A weaker real is giving a boost to some stocks, such as
steelmakers,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, a strategist at Futura
Corretora brokerage in  Sao Paulo , said in a phone interview.
“Steelmakers fell quite a lot in the first half of the year,
but the latest news about them has been more positive, and
there’s probably room for further gains.”  Gerdau added 4.5 percent to 17.64 reais. The company posted
adjusted net income of 595.1 million reais, which compares with
the average estimate of 441.4 million reais, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Usiminas, as Usinas de  Minas Gerais  is also known, advanced
1.6 percent to 11.87 reais, extending this month’s increase to
13 percent.  OGX Removal  Embraer dropped 0.8 percent to 16.36 reais. Magazine Luiza
jumped 6.6 percent to 9.59 reais.  The Ibovespa  dropped  earlier today as much as 1.1 percent
after oil company OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA plunged on
its bankruptcy protection filing. Shares sank 24 percent,
extending this year’s slump to 97 percent. While the stock will
still trade in Sao Paulo, it will no longer be a  member  of the
Ibovespa benchmark starting tomorrow, BM&FBovespa said in a
statement. The index will be rebalanced after OGX’s removal.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 6.87 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.61 billion
reais this year through Oct. 22, according to the latest data
available from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
