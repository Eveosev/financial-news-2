Senator  Rand Paul , a Republican from
Kentucky, said the National Security Agency has overreached by
listening to the phone conversations of foreign leaders such as
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and it’s conceivable, though
unlikely, the agency is tapping President  Barack Obama ’s phone.  “I say that a bit facetiously, but at the same time, the
warrants that are coming out of the FISA court are so expansive
and without limit and non-specific that they apply to all
cellphones,” Paul said today, referring to the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act.  “So conceivably the NSA could be spying on the president’s
phone,” Paul said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Political Capital with  Al Hunt ” airing this weekend.  “The definition of overreach is everything the NSA has
been doing over the last several years,” Paul said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
