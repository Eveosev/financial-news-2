SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. is being
investigated by  Japan ’s  Securities and Exchange Surveillance
Commission  for a possible insider trading violation by an
executive, the brokerage said in an e-mailed statement.  The executive allegedly told an acquaintance that
management of Enoteca Co., a Japanese wine importer, were
preparing to buy the company’s shares through a tender offer,
the Asahi newspaper reported earlier, without saying where it
got the information. The acquaintance traded the stock before
the  management buyout  was announced, the newspaper said.  “We are fully cooperating with the commission’s
investigation,” SMBC Nikko said in the statement, declining to
comment further. The brokerage is a unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest banking group by
market value.  The SESC searched SMBC Nikko’s office and the executive’s
house, and will continue the probe before determining whether to
recommend charges by prosecutors, the newspaper said. An SESC
spokesman, who didn’t want to be identified, citing the
commission’s policy, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
