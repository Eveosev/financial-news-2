Peru ’s central bank will probably
leave borrowing costs unchanged for a fifth month as the threat
of recession in Europe and the U.S. outweighs concern about
accelerating inflation.  The seven-member board, led by central bank President
Julio Velarde, will keep the overnight rate at 4.25 percent
today, according to 17 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
One analyst predicts a 0.25-point cut to 4 percent. The board
will announce its decision at about 7 p.m.  New York  time.  The threat of stagnation in Europe and the U.S. has dimmed
the outlook for Peru’s commodity-dependent economy and led the
government to announce what it has called “preventive”
stimulus measures. Though the central bank has indicated it will
cut rates if global risks intensify and domestic activity slows,
rising prices and stronger-than-expected domestic growth
indicate there’s no need for laxer policy yet, said Juan Pablo Fuentes, a Latin America economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc.  “There’s a risk of a hard landing, so the government is
preparing its tools for a negative scenario,” Fuentes said in a
telephone interview from  West Chester ,  Pennsylvania . “The
central bank will be paying attention to the very fluid global
situation and change its stance if necessary.”  Stimulus, Sentiment  The Andean nation is tapping its first fiscal surplus in
three years to finance stimulus measures worth about $470
million as it seeks to reverse a decline in public
infrastructure spending in the first half of this year.  The stimulus will become more “aggressive” should a
global slowdown cause exports and company spending to ease,
Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said Sept. 22.  The  International Monetary Fund  on Sept. 20 cut its 2011
growth forecast for Peru to 6.2 percent from 6.6 percent
previously. Growth will slow to 5.6 percent next year, the
Washington-based lender said.  The central bank’s latest  survey  shows companies are less
optimistic about domestic demand and hiring prospects because
the global outlook has darkened, said Carlos Durand, president
of the Lima Chamber of Commerce, in a Sept. 27 interview.  Investor caution on the global outlook and “political
uncertainty” following Peru’s presidential election is
affecting medium and long-term investment, Luis Castellanos,
chief executive of Banco Internacional del Peru, told reporters
Sept. 29. Demand for consumer loans remains “vigorous,” he
said.  Policy, Trade, Growth  President  Ollanta Humala  on Oct. 3 confirmed Velarde’s
appointment to serve a second five-year term, which  Pedro Tuesta , a former Peruvian central bank analyst and current
economist at 4Cast Inc. in  Washington , said indicated policy
continuity.  Growth in retail and services helped offset a slowdown in
manufacturing and construction in July and fuelled a 6.5 percent
rise in gross domestic product, beating analysts’ and the
central bank’s expectations.  Cement demand rose for the first time in three months in
August while electricity output climbed at the fastest annual
pace in six months, which suggests growth is accelerating,
Tuesta said.  Peru’s trade surplus will probably fall to $4.3 billion
next year from $7.4 billion this year because of lower copper,
zinc, gold and silver prices, Velarde said Oct. 4.  China ’s growth will remain “strong” this year and next,
which “will guarantee that the price of exports will remain
relatively high,” he said.  Gross domestic product growth will slow to 5.7 percent in
2012 from 6.3 percent this year, the central bank chief said
Sept. 16.  Europe , Precautions  Economic activity will slow in the next few months amid
weaker construction and manufacturing output even though
consumer demand remains “very strong” Velarde told congress
Oct. 4. “In investment, there isn’t a lot of pessimism, but nor
has there been such a strong recovery yet.” Investors “are
waiting to see what will happen with the global outlook.”  Policy makers will probably give more weight to the fall-
out from Europe’s debt crisis, which led global stocks and
commodity prices to tumble since their last meeting, said
 Roberto Melzi , at strategist at Barclays Capital Inc. in New
York.  “Risks to economic activity haven’t dissipated anywhere by
any means,” said Melzi, who forecasts a 0.25-point rate cut
today to be followed by similar cuts at the bank’s November and
December meetings. “The global crisis is deepening.”  Higher fuel costs pushed Peru’s consumer prices up 0.33
percent in September from 0.27 percent in August, driving the
annual inflation rate to 3.73 percent, a two-year high. The
central bank targets annual inflation in a range of 1 percent to
3 percent.  Monthly inflation may slow to close to zero before year-end
as some prices reverse recent increases, Velarde said Sept. 16.
The annual inflation rate will converge toward the central
bank’s target range next year, he said.  Peru’s sol posted the steepest quarterly decline since 2008
in the July-through-September period as copper prices fell and
concern about slowing world growth wiped $10 trillion from
global equities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
