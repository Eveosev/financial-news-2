U.S. state revenue may fall short of
forecasts, which may lead to “widespread” budget cuts,  Fitch
Ratings  said.  Most states projected fiscal 2012 revenue before national
economic forecasts were revised downward, which may reduce tax
collections, Fitch said in a report today. Year-over-year growth
didn’t improve in 32 states in August, compared with the
previous month, Fitch said.  “Although state revenues have shown signs of recovery in
2011, employment performance is far from robust, and trends are
not positive,” Fitch said. September’s revenue results “will
be a helpful indicator of whether widespread budget adjustments
will be needed,” the ratings company said.  California Comptroller John Chiang  warned  in September that
the state would need to decide by December whether to “pull the
trigger to cut more program funding,” after revenue for the
first two months of the fiscal year came in $403.8 million under
projections. Florida will likely lower its revenue forecast this
month because of slower-than-expected growth and a faltering
housing market,  Amy Baker , the Legislature’s chief economist,
said in an interview Sept. 9.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg in September forecast that
the  U.S. economy  would grow 2.2 percent in 2012, down from
January expectations of 3.2 percent, according to the median
estimate. The  Federal Reserve  in June cut its expectations for
2012 growth to a range of 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent from a
range of 3.5 to 4.4 percent in  January .  To contact the reporter on this story:
