ICAP Plc (IAP) , the world’s largest broker
of transactions between banks, cut about 50 jobs in  Brazil  this
week after two years of losses, said two people familiar with
the matter that asked not to be named because there was no
public announcement.  The broker had about 240 staff in the South American
country before the cuts, one of the people said.  ICAP Chief Executive Officer  Michael Spencer  said on a
Sept. 29 conference call the company expects to break even in
Brazil in 2012 after two years of losses.  The staff reduction is part of a broader restructuring,
Alan Gandelman, the firm’s country head, said today in a
telephone interview.  “We’re in the middle of an internal and external
restructuring process, which in fact involves job cuts and
hasn’t ended yet,” Gandelman said, without providing the number
of job cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
