Russia ’s central bank is ready to
provide “a lot” of liquidity if needed, First Deputy Chairman
 Alexei Ulyukayev  said today in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in Moscow.  Ulyukayev said the bank sought to stem the ruble’s
volatility and not defend the currency with $8 billion of sales
last month on the domestic market. More interventions are
“possible but not most probable” as pressure on the ruble goes
down, Ulyukayev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
