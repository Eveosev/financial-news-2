Agco Corp. (AGCO)  said it’s in talks to buy
a manufacturer of sugar-cane harvesters in Brazil as it expands
in the South American nation, the world’s top sugar producer.  Agco, the world’s third-largest farm-equipment maker, will
likely reach an accord next month, Chief Executive Officer
Martin Richenhagen said yesterday in an interview, declining to
identify the acquisition target. The company would be absorbed
by Agco’s Valtra brand, he said.  “The deal should be closed within four to six weeks,”
Richenhagen said at Bloomberg’s  Sao Paulo  office. The target
company “has a more comprehensive product line than we have
today and our development and their existing products are a very
good fit.”  Duluth, Georgia-based Agco is looking to acquire companies
that will expands its products and geographic reach. A deal in
 Brazil  would follow the company’s announcement earlier this week
that it will buy GSI Holdings Corp. from closely held
Centerbridge Partners LP for $940 million.  “Today they do about 10 percent of their sales in Brazil
only, and we think they can do much better because the market
demand is very high,” Richenhagen said about GSI.  Richenhagen said the company is also developing its own
sugar-cane harvester, which it will introduce by the end of next
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
