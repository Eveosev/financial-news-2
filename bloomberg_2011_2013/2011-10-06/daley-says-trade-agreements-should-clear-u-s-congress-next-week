The U.S. Senate may vote on pending
free-trade agreements as soon as Oct. 12, Majority Leader  Harry
Reid  said after White House Chief of Staff  William Daley  urged
lawmakers to finish work on the pacts next week.  Passing the accords as well as Trade Adjustment Assistance
for workers who lose their jobs to foreign competition is an
“essential piece of the president’s jobs agenda,” Daley said
last night in Washington.  Reid, a Nevada Democrat, outlined his
chamber’s planned voting schedule today in a speech on the
Senate floor.  President  Barack Obama  sent Congress legislation for the
trade accords reached four years ago on Oct. 3 after House
Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said he would consider
the worker assistance in tandem with the trade deals. Action by
both chambers would send the accords to Obama on the eve of a
state visit by South Korea’s President  Lee Myung Bak .  “We need to get all four elements of this package -- the
three trade deals and TAA -- across the finish line next week,”
Daley told representatives of companies including  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  at a fund-raising dinner for the
National Foreign Trade Council’s educational foundation.  The Senate Finance Committee today scheduled an Oct. 11
hearing on the trade accords. House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor ,
a Virginia Republican, said on Oct. 3 that his chamber also
plans to vote next week.  Plea Against Bickering  Daley said he expects the worker-aid program, which has
been opposed by some Republicans, to receive a House vote on
Oct. 12 and that “we hope to see continuing bipartisan support
for a good plan and that we do not see the sort of bickering and
partisanship that seems to have taken over this town on so many
issues.”  The  South Korea  deal, the biggest since the North American
Free Trade Agreement, would boost U.S. exports by as much as
$10.9 billion in the first year in which it’s in full effect,
according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. The accord
with Colombia would increase exports by as much as $1.1 billion
a year.  The House Ways and Means Committee voted to advance the
pacts yesterday.  Obama spent two years after taking office seeking to
broaden Democratic support for the trade accords. He negotiated
new terms for auto tariffs in the South Korea agreement that won
over the United Auto Workers union, a deal on exchanging tax
information with Panama and labor-rights assurances from
Colombia. Companies from  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  to  General Electric
Co. (GE)  have lobbied for the agreements to increase market access.  Job Gains, Losses  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says the trade agreements will
prevent the loss of 380,000 jobs. The pacts will destroy 159,000
jobs by encouraging companies to send work overseas, according
to the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor federation.  While Daley said the South Korea agreement will support
70,000 U.S. jobs and open markets to boost American
competitiveness, he said businesses should push for Congress to
approve the worker assistance to help people who lose jobs
because of trade deals. Business groups such as the Chamber have
backed the renewal of worker aid.  “Those of us who believe trade is worth fighting for must
fight equally hard for the program of TAA,” Daley said. “I
hope we can continue to work together to break through this
ridiculous gridlock in  Washington .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
