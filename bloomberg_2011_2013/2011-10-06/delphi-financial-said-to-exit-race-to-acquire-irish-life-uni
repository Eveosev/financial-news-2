Delphi Financial Group Inc. dropped
out of the race to acquire  Irish Life  & Permanent Plc’s life
assurance unit as bidders prepare second-round offers within the
next two weeks, according to two people with direct knowledge of
the matter.  The Wilmington, Delaware-based insurer, which specializes
in employee benefits for companies, was among five parties
short-listed by the Irish Life and its advisers Deutsche Bank AG
for the business, three people with knowledge of the situation
said Aug. 19. The others were a joint bid by U.S. leveraged-
buyout firms JC Flowers & Co. and Apollo Global Management LLC
as well as offers from CVC Capital Partners Ltd., the London-
based private-equity firm, U.S. insurer Unum Group and Great-
West Lifeco Inc.’s Canada Life Ireland, they said.  Ireland’s government is forcing the breakup of Irish Life
to recoup some of the cost of bailing out the Dublin-based
lender’s unprofitable banking unit. The life unit had an
embedded value, an estimate of a life insurer’s worth based
future profits of existing policyholders, of 1.59 billion euros
($2.1 billion) at the end of June, according to the company.  Bernard Kilkelly, vice president of  investor relations  at
Delphi Financial, declined to comment yesterday. Irish Life
spokesman  Ray Gordon  wasn’t available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
