(Corrects to remove statement that the official advocated a
higher franc cap.)  The Swiss State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs, part of the  Economy Ministry , said capping
the Swiss franc against the euro at 1.20 has brought stability,

Anzeiger reported, citing an interview with Marie-Gabrielle Ineichen-Fleisch, who heads the secretariat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
