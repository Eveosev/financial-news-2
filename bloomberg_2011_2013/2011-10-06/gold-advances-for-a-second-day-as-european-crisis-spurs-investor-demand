Gold futures rose for the second
straight day and silver surged as commodities and equities
rallied amid optimism that European officials were making
progress in taming the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials gained
as much as 2.6 percent, led by gains in copper and silver. The
 European Central Bank  will resume covered-bond purchases and
reintroduce yearlong loans for banks, President  Jean-Claude
Trichet  said.  “Gold is back to behaving like a classic commodity,”
 Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “Physical demand is providing support to
gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $11.60, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $1,653.20 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The precious metal is heading for the first
weekly gain in five.  Futures reached a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6 as investors
sought alternatives to equities and some currencies. The metal
has climbed 16 percent this year. Spot gold is in the 11th year
of a bull market, the longest rally since at least 1920.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed $1.653, or 5.4
percent, to $32.005 an ounce, the biggest jump since July 13.
The price has advanced 39 percent in the past 12 months.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery gained $25.20, or 1.7 percent, to $1,508.10 an
ounce.  Palladium futures for December delivery climbed $28.45, or
5 percent, to $598.80 an ounce, rising for the second straight
day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
