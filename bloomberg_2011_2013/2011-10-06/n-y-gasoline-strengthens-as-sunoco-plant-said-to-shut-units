Gasoline in  New York  gained as  Sunoco
Inc. (SUN)  was said to shut a reformer and low-sulfur gasoline unit
for planned work at the Marcus Hook refinery in Pennsylvania.  The units are expected to be offline for 11 to 15 days,
said a person with direct knowledge of the maintenance who
declined to be identified because the information isn’t public.
Another person said the units would be offline between two and
four weeks.  The premium to New York-traded futures for reformulated,
87-octane gasoline in the New York Harbor region rose 1.25 cents
to 13.75 cents a gallon at 11:37 a.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained 6.63 cents to
$2.7605 a gallon.  The Marcus Hook reformer converts naphtha to feedstock for
a UDEX unit. The equipment is collectively known as the 17-
Plant, according to state’s Department of Environmental
Protection.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  Bayway refinery in  New Jersey  reported
flaring yesterday, according to a filing with state regulators.  Imports of gasoline to the region fell 124,000 barrels to
397,000 barrels a day last week, the Energy Department reported
yesterday. The shipments were the lowest since at least 2004,
when the department began showing regional data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
