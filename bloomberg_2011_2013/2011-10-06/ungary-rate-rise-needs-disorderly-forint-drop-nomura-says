Hungary ’s central bank may only raise
 interest rates  if there is a “disorderly deterioration” in the
currency, Nomura Plc said after meeting Magyar Nemzeti Bank
President Andras Simor in London.  “We maintain our core view that it is difficult to see the
triggers for the central bank hiking without a significant and
disorderly deterioration in the currency and risk premia”
rising because of domestic factors, London-based Nomura
economist Peter Attard Montalto said in a research report today.
“As such we maintain our baseline of rates on hold through the
end of next year but with risks much more skewed to the next
rate being a hike rather than a cut.”  Raising the benchmark interest rate would probably take
precedence for the central bank over intervention in the
 currency market  to bolster the forint, Nomura said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
