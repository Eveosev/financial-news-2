Calls give the right to buy.  “While there are good prospects for the main crop in West
Africa, there is still a lot of uncertainty associated with the
mid-crop,” Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank International,
said by phone from London today. “The move in calls could be
playing a role in the market retracing recent losses.”  Cocoa fell to $2,540 a ton on Oct. 4, the lowest price
since July 9, 2009. The price slid on speculation crops in West
Africa would be larger than initially estimated, leaving a small
surplus in 2011-12 after supplies exceeded demand by a record
325,000 tons in the 2010-11 season, according to the
International Cocoa Organization.  Bean supplies will exceed demand by 12,000 tons in the
2011-12 season which started this month, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 11 traders, brokers and analysts published
on Sept. 23. The market will have a small surplus in the season
started October, Jean-Marc Anga, ICCO executive director, said
at a press conference in  London  on the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
