MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said it will take a charge of $115 million to $135
million for the third quarter to adjust reserves as it uses
additional data to identify cases where it hadn’t paid claims.  The review involves the use of Social Security
Administration death records, the New York-based insurer said
today in a regulatory filing.  MetLife and smaller rivals have been pressed by regulators
to move more swiftly to identify dead policyholders. The
insurance departments in Florida and  California  have
investigated whether life insurers failed to pay benefits. The
firms are generally required to pay claims after being notified
of a policyholder’s death and receiving a valid death
certificate.  MetLife is using Social Security data “to identify certain
group life insurance certificates, individual life insurance
policies and other contracts where the covered person may be
deceased, but a claim has not yet been presented to the
company,” the insurer said in the filing.  Third-quarter results include $80 million to $100 million
in catastrophe losses, and the company will take a charge of
about $40 million related to supporting policyholders of
Executive Life Insurance Company of  New York . Regulators turned
to healthy insurers to help fund Executive Life’s obligations
after it was put into rehabilitation about 20 years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
