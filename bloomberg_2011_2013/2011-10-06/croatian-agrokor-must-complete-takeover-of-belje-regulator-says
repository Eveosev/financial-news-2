Agrokor d.d.  Croatia ’s largest
private company, must complete the takeover of its agricultural
facility, Belje d.d., following the 2005 acquisition of a
majority stake, the country’s market regulator said.  Agrokor, which bought more Belje shares in 2007, now owns
67 percent of the eastern Croatian agricultural plant. The
regulator’s decision has an immediate effect, while Agrokor can
file a complaint to the administrative court, the regulator said
today in a statement on its website in Zagreb.  The purchase, which may cost Agrokor as much as 100 million
euros ($134 million), may present an obstacle to Agrokor’s plans
to acquire a majority stake in Slovenia’s  Mercator Poslovni
Sistem (MELR)  d.d., said Petar Brkic of Abacus Brokeri d.d.  “This decision probably signals the end of Agrokor’s plan
to take over Mercator,” Brkic said by phone. “It affects
Agrokor’s stability and the banks that have supported the plan
concerning Mercator will have to take this obligation into
account.”  Agrokor will probably have to offer about 300 kuna per
share, the price of Belje’s stock when Agrokor’s “obligation
originated in 2007,” according to the regulator. Belje’s shares
closed at 70 kuna per share today.  Mercator Interest  Agrokor repeatedly said it is interested in submitting an
offer for a majority stake in Llubljana-based Mercator, the
region’s largest supermarket chain.  Agrokor has already secured about 700 million euros ($951
million) in a syndicated loan from a group of European banks,
including Deutsche Bank AG, Societe Generale SA, UniCredit SpA,
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Erste Group Bank AG, Raiffeisen Bank
International AG and UBS AG, the Ljubljana-based newspaper
Finance said on Sept. 28.  Slovenian banks and other Mercator investors in August
appointed ING Bank NV to advise on the sale of just more than 50
percent of Mercator with the process likely to be completed by
the end of the year.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story:
