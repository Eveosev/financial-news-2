Chile â€™s central bank sold $38 million
of 10-year bonds denominated in pesos at a yield of 4.97
percent, the first time it has paid less than 5 percent since at
least July 2004.  The bank also sold $84 million of inflation-linked 10-year
bonds at a yield of 2.24 percent, the lowest since February
2009. The inflation-linked bond sale had been rescheduled after
an auction on Sept. 20 was declared void.  Demand for the inflation-linked bonds totaled more than
twice the amount offered, while demand for the fixed-rate bonds
was more than three times the amount offered.  Banks bought 45 percent of the fixed-rate peso bonds and 20
percent of the inflation-linked bonds, the central bank said.
Pension funds and others took the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
