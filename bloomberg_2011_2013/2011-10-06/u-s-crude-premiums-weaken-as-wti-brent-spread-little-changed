U.S. Gulf crude premiums weakened
after the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent was
little changed.  The gap between WTI and Brent November contracts increased
9 cents to settle at $23.14 a barrel in  New York . The spread
settled Sept. 6 at a record margin of $26.87.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 45 cents to
$26.50 a barrel at 2:57 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost 35
cents to $26.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend decreased 65 cents to $22.75 a barrel while Poseidon
weakened 15 cents to $22.50 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed 80 cents to $21.45
a barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 90
cents a barrel below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium decreased 65
cents to $26.10 above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $10 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$9.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
