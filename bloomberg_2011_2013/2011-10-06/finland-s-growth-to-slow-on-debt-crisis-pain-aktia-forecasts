Finland’s economic growth will slow
and a recession is possible if  Europe ’s debt crisis spirals out
of control,  Aktia Oyj (AKTAV)  said.  Gross domestic product will expand 2.8 percent this year
and 1.4 percent in 2012, Aktia said, cutting its forecasts from
3.8 percent and 2.4 percent respectively. The likelihood of a
recession in Europe is “high” at 40 percent, Chief Economist
Timo Tyrvaeinen wrote in an e-mailed report today.  “If the debt crisis becomes unmanageable, we’re headed for
a banking crisis,” Tyrvaeinen said. “A recession caused by
freezing credit markets and lack of confidence will most likely
be deep.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
