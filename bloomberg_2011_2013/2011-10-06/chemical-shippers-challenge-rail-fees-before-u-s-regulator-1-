CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF)  and  PPG
Industries Inc. (PPG)  are among companies whose challenge of toxic-
chemical shipping charges will be heard by the Surface
Transportation Board, the U.S. agency that regulates freight
railroads.  The agency announced the hearing today in the Federal
Register. It is consolidating two challenges to tariffs and
handling practices for carrying toxic chemicals that were
brought separately against three subsidiaries of  RailAmerica
Inc. (RA)  and against a fourth holding, Alabama Gulf Coast Railway
LLC.  The legal issues raised “may ultimately affect not only
the parties to the two cases before the board but others within
the industry that transport, handle, receive or ship” these
chemicals, the board wrote in a Sept. 30  decision .  RailAmerica, based in Jacksonville,  Florida , owns 43
regional and short-line railroads that operate in 27 states and
three Canadian provinces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
