German Economy Minister Philipp
Roesler said it is his country’s “emphatic” aim to keep all 17

Roesler said his proposals for the future European Security
Mechanism, called ESM, that are aimed at helping states forced
to tap the rescue fund, underline that goal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
