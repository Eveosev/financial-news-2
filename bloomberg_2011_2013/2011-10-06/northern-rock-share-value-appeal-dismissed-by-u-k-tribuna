A U.K. tribunal rejected an appeal of
a decision that Northern Rock Plc shares had no value following
a government bailout.  Shareholders challenged the valuation of Northern Rock’s
shares at zero when the lender was nationalized during the
financial crisis in 2008, according  the ruling  dated Oct. 4.  The  Bank of England  provided emergency liquidity to
Northern Rock in 2007 when money markets froze, leaving the bank
unable to gain funding by securitizing its mortgages. The
government took ownership of all Northern Rock shares in
February 2008.  “We have before us no evidence that the government damaged
Northern Rock,” Judge Nicholas Warren wrote in the final
decision.  A call and e-mail seeking comment from the Northern Rock
shareholder action group wasn’t immediately returned.  The case is: Northern Rock v. Andrew Caldwell and HM
Treasury, Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber),
NR/001/2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
