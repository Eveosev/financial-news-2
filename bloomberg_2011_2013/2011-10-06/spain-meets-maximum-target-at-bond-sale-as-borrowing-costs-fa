Spain  sold 4.5 billion euros ($6
billion) of bonds, meeting its maximum target, and its borrowing
costs fell as the  European Central Bank  supported the nation’s
debt on the secondary market.  The Treasury sold bonds due in April 2014 at an average
yield of 3.589 percent, compared with 4.813 percent the last
time they was sold on Aug. 4, the Bank of Spain said. Securities
due October 2014 yielded an average 3.495 percent, compared with
4.291 percent in July and bonds maturing in April 2015 yielded
3.639 percent.  Demand for the April 2014 debt was 1.78 times the amount
sold, compared with 2.14 at the August auction. The bid-to-cover
ratio was 2.02 for the October 2014 bonds compared with 2.29 in
July, and 2.07 for the April 2015 securities.  Spain’s borrowing costs have fallen since the ECB started
propping up its bond market on Aug. 8. The ECB bought Spanish
 government securities  yesterday, according to three people with
knowledge of the transactions, helping push the yield on Spain’s
10-year bond to a one-month low.  The yield on Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond, which reached
a 6.3 percent euro-era high on July 18, dipped below 5 percent
to 4.983 percent, and traded at 5 percent at 11:00 a.m. in
Madrid. That narrowed the spread over German bonds to 311 basis
points, from 325 basis points yesterday.  “Sentiment seems to be playing in favor of Spain,” said
Fadi Zaher, a fixed-income strategist at  Barclays Wealth  in
 London . “Spain’s economic outlook is making it more and more
obvious the country is becoming the bridge between the euro
zone’s periphery and core countries.”  Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is trying to
cut a  budget deficit  that’s three times the European Union limit
and avoid following Greece, Portugal and Ireland into a bailout.
His Socialist government has taken the deepest austerity
measures in three decades, and polls say the party will lose the
Nov. 20 next general election to the People’s Party’s leader
 Mariano Rajoy , who has also promised fiscal consolidation.  The government aims to cut the deficit to 6 percent of
gross domestic product this year, from 9.2 percent in 2010, and
Finance Minister Elena Salgado yesterday said that goal takes
“priority” over growth in the “remaining months of the
year.” GDP growth rate slowed to 0.2 percent in the second
quarter from 0.4 percent in the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
