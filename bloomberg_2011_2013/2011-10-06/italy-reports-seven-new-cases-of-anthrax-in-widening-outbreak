Italy  reported seven new cases of
anthrax in livestock since last week as the deadly animal
disease spreads in the country’s south, bringing affected farms
to 26 since the first confirmation in September.  The illness killed cattle, sheep and horses or donkeys on
seven farms across four towns southeast of Naples, Italy’s
Ministry of Health said in an  alert  today published online by
the Paris-based World Organization of Animal Health, or OIE. One
of the towns had no previous occurrence.  Anthrax , which has been used as a biological weapon, is
caused by spores of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis and can
survive in soil years after an outbreak, according to the OIE.
Livestock typically become infected by ingesting spores from the
soil or in feed, according to the group.  Animals died on four farms in Pietrapertosa as well as on
farms in Corleto Perticara and Padula, adding to previously
reported cases, according to the alert. Italy also found anthrax
in Laurenzana, the first case there, it showed.  The outbreak continues, and measures to fight the disease
include animal-movement controls and disinfection of infected
farms, the  animal-health  group said. Livestock is not being
vaccinated, the OIE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
