Israeli Finance Minister Yuval
Steinitz told the Cabinet that tax revenue in 2012 is expected
to be 5 billion shekels lower than planned, as activity in the
real estate and capital markets decline, Calcalist reported,
without saying where it got the information. The finance
minister’s spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for
comment.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
