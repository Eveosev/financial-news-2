Orange-juice futures climbed to a
one-week high on signs of dwindling supplies in the U.S., the
world’s second-biggest producer. Cotton also advanced.  As of Oct. 4, orange-juice inventories monitored by ICE
Futures U.S. fell 46 percent in the past year. Most of the fruit
supplies from  Florida , where the harvest started this month and
runs through July, may take a month to reach processors, said
 Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials rose as much as 2.6
percent today.  “Supplies are down at the end of the harvest,” Tintle
said in a telephone interview from Tampa, Florida. “The whole
commodity sector has been rising the last couple of days, and
that’s been helping.”  Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 1.5 cents,
or 1 percent, to settle at $1.5485 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE in
 New York . Earlier, the price reached $1.566, the highest for a
most-active contract since Sept. 26. In the third quarter, the
price tumbled 20 percent, the most since the end of 2008.  The dollar fell for the second straight day against a
basket of currencies, enhancing the appeal of U.S. commodities.
 Brazil  is the leading orange grower, followed by Florida.  U.S. equities advanced for the third straight day as
European officials presented plans to contain the sovereign-debt
crisis.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.43 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $1.0273 a pound in New York, the third straight
gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
