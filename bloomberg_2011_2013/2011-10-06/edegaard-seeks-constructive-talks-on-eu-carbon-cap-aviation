European Union Climate Commissioner
 Connie Hedegaard  welcomed a court adviser’s opinion on a
challenge to the EU’s planned expansion of a carbon cap-and-
trade system beyond the bloc’s borders.  “I am glad to see that the Advocate General’s opinion
concludes that EU Directive is fully compatible with
international law,” Hedegaard said today in a statement. “The
EU reaffirms its wish to engage constructively with third
countries during the implementation of this legislation.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
