Australian properties listed for sale
climbed 5.6 percent in September from the previous month,
according to data from  SQM Research Pty.   Homes listed for sale jumped to 383,287 in September from
362,793 in August, the Sydney-based research group said in an e-
mailed statement. Listings surged 24.2 percent in September from
a year ago.  The increase “was to be expected given the normal seasonal
rise in listings that occurs this time of year,” SQM Managing
Director Louis Christopher said in the statement. “Nevertheless,
listings are well up on numbers recorded last year.”  Properties listed for sale in  Melbourne  soared 65.3 percent
from a year earlier, the most among  Australia ’s eight capital
cities. Listings in Sydney climbed the most since the previous
month, rising 12.9 percent, SQM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
