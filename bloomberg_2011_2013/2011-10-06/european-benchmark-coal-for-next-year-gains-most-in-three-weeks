Benchmark European coal advanced,
heading for a highest daily gain in three weeks.  Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp with settlement next year increased 0.8 percent to $120
a metric ton as of 10:35 a.m. in  London . That would be the
biggest one-day rise since Sept. 15.  Bloomberg tracks data from information supplied by ICAP
