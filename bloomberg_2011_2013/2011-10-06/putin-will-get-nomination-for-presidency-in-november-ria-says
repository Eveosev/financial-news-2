Russia ’s ruling United Russia party
will nominate Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  next month as its
candidate in 2012 presidential elections, RIA Novosti reported,
citing   Boris Gryzlov , the party’s second-ranking official.  The congress will probably take place on November 20, the
state news service cited Gryzlov as saying today in Tula,
central Russia.  Putin, 58, said Sept. 24 he’ll seek to return to the
presidency in March elections, pushing aside his protégé,  Dmitry Medvedev , who replaced him in the Kremlin for four years because
of a constitutional ban on three consecutive terms. Two more
six-year terms would give Putin 24 years at the helm, making him
the longest-serving leader since  Josef Stalin .  To contact the reporters on this story:
