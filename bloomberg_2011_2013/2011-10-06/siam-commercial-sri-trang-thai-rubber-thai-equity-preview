Shares of the following companies had

The SET Index surged 51.07 points, or 5.9 percent, to 913.72,
the largest gain since Jan. 5, 2009.  Oil companies :  PTT Pcl (PTT)  , Thailand’s biggest energy
company, jumped 10 percent to 275 baht, the steepest increase
since Nov. 3, 2008.  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP)  ,
the nation’s only publicly traded oil explorer, climbed 4.9
percent to 149 baht.  Crude oil rose for a second day in New York as shrinking
U.S. crude supplies, better-than-expected economic data and
signs Europe can control its debt crisis allayed concerns that
fuel consumption will suffer.  Rubber producers:  Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl (STA)  , the
country’s biggest publicly traded rubber producer, increased 9.7
percent to 15.8 baht, the most since Dec. 1. Thai Rubber Latex
Corp. (Thailand) Pcl (TRUBB TB) advanced 7.1 percent to 3 baht.  Rubber in Tokyo advanced for a third day as better-than-
expected U.S. economic data buoyed the outlook for demand, and
Malaysia supported Thailand’s move to set a minimum price for
the commodity used in tires.  Central Pattana Pcl (CPN)  , the nation’s largest shopping
mall operator, rose 7.1 percent to 33.75 baht, the steepest
advance since July 22. The company sold 2 billion baht ($64
million) of bonds yesterday, a person familiar with the deal
said.  Siam Commercial Bank Pcl (SCB)  , the country’s fourth-
biggest lender by assets, climbed 5.9 percent to 103 baht. The
bank maintained its full-year target for lending growth at
between 15 percent and 18 percent, President Kannikar
Chalitaporn told reporters. The Bangkok-based lender’s loan
portfolio expanded about 22 percent in the first eight months of
this year from the same period last year.  Thai Vegetable Oil Pcl (TVO)  , the nation’s largest
soybean supplier, jumped 5.6 percent to 17 baht, the most since
March 3. The company was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at
Bualuang Securities Pcl, which cited the expected increase in
soy bean prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
