OpenLink Financial Inc. will host a
lender meeting on Oct. 11 at 10 a.m. in  New York  to discuss the
financing to support Hellman & Friedman LLC’s acquisition of the
company from Carlyle Group, according to a person with knowledge
of the transaction.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the deal for the
Uniondale, New York-based provider of financial software, which
will include a $325 million  term loan  maturing in six years and
a $50 million revolving line of credit due in five years, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private.  The term loan will be covenant-lite, meaning it won’t carry
any financial-maintenance requirements, the person said.  Judith Peterson, a spokeswoman for OpenLink, didn’t respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  Editors: Pierre Paulden, Mitchell Martin  To contact the reporter on this story:
