Yang Yuanqing, chief executive
officer of  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , comments on the death of  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  Chairman Steve Jobs.  Jobs ensured Apple’s competitors are “pushed even
harder,” Yang said today in an e-mailed statement distributed
by Lenovo, China’s biggest maker of personal-computers.  “Today the world lost one of its greatest innovators and
visionaries with the passing of Steve Jobs. His achievements are
unmatched in our time.  ‘‘Steve led this industry like a beacon for the past
decade. As a competitor, he helped ensure all of us pushed even
harder, and I am confident his legacy will continue to energize
the industry for many years to come.  ‘‘We admired his spirit, his creativity and his passion. He
not only changed the technology industry, he changed the world
and made it better.  ‘‘While we will all feel this enormous loss, I am confident
that this industry will take to heart the lessons Steve taught
us about innovation.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
