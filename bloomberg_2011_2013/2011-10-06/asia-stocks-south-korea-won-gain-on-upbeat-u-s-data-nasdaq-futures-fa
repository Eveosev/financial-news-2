U.S. stocks rallied for a third day,
commodities gained and Treasuries slid as European officials
detailed plans to tame the sovereign debt crisis and reports on
retail sales and jobless claims bolstered optimism in the
economy. The euro reversed an earlier drop versus the dollar.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.8 percent to
1,164.97 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Russell 2000 Index of
smaller U.S. stocks extended a three-day advance to 11 percent,
its best since 2009. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index surged 2.7
percent. Ten-year Treasury yields added 10 basis points to 1.99
percent. The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.3439 after losing 0.8
percent. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities jumped 2.5 percent as
oil increased 3.7 percent to $82.59 a barrel.  American equities extended a global rally after European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the ECB will
resume covered-bond purchases and reintroduce yearlong loans for
banks, while defying calls for an interest-rate cut and
acknowledging “downside risks” to the economy have
intensified. The European Commission is pushing for a
coordinated capital injection for banks to shield them from the
fallout of a potential Greek default.  “People have priced in a Lehman II type of situation,”
Brian Barish, Denver-based president of Cambiar Investors LLC,
which oversees about $8 billion, said in a telephone interview.
“You start to hear some credible stuff on European bank
recapitalization. They will do what they’ve got to do to prevent
a Lehman from happening. There’s a good chance we might’ve had a
bottom in stocks.”  Covered Bonds  The 2.5 trillion-euro market for covered bonds -- assets
backed by mortgages or public-sector loans -- underpins much of
 Europe ’s real estate lending, which almost ground to a halt in
the wake of  Lehman Brothers  Holdings Inc.’s collapse in
September 2008.  U.S. stocks also climbed after claims for  unemployment
benefits  rose less than forecast last week to a level that shows
the pace of dismissals may be slowing. Applications for jobless
benefits climbed by 6,000 to 401,000, Labor Department figures
showed. Economists projected 410,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The monthly average
dropped to the lowest level since the end of August.  Government data tomorrow are forecast to show employers
added 55,000 jobs last month and the  unemployment rate  held at
9.1 percent, according to the median estimates.  Bear Market Averted  The  S&P 500  has rebounded 6 percent since Oct. 3, when it
closed within 1 percent of a level that would have marked a
bear-market plunge of 20 percent from its April peak. The S&P
GSCI commodities gauge is up 5.3 percent in two days, its best
back-to-back advance since May, and has trimmed its drop from
this year’s high to 20 percent. Treasury yields have increased
after demand for safer assets dragged the 10-year note’s rate to
a record low of 1.67 percent on Sept. 23. The Dollar Index has
slipped about 1.1 percent since Oct. 4, when it reached the
highest level since January.  Indexes of financial, commodity and consumer companies rose
at least 2.2 percent today to lead gains in all 10 industry
groups in the S&P 500. Bank of America Corp. jumped 8.8 percent
and Alcoa Inc. rallied 5.4 percent for the top gains in the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average .  The S&P 500 Financials Index has rallied 8.8 percent in
three days, its steepest advance since July 2009, to trim its
year-to-date loss to 23 percent. U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy
F. Geithner  told the Senate Banking Committee today that there
is “absolutely” no chance of another U.S. financial
institution collapsing like Lehman Brothers.  Retail Sales, Apple  Target Corp. climbed 4.3 percent today and Limited Brands
Inc. and Saks Inc. also rose after reporting September sales
that surpassed analysts’ projections. Apple Inc. shares slipped
0.2 percent after co-founder  Steve Jobs  died.  The cost to protect the debt of Morgan Stanley and
Citigroup Inc. declined amid growing speculation Europe’s
leaders will be able to prevent the debt crisis from infecting
bank balance sheets.  Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley, the owner of the
world’s biggest retail brokerage, fell 55 basis points to 475,
the biggest decline since May 2009, and those on Citigroup slid
40.5 basis points to 304.57, the largest drop since Nov. 24,
2008, according to data provider CMA. Swaps on Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. eased 25 basis points to 371, the data show.  Wall Street strategists say the S&P 500 will post the
biggest fourth-quarter rally in 13 years even after they cut
forecasts at a rate exceeded only during the credit crisis.  The benchmark index for U.S. stocks will climb 14 percent
from yesterday to end 2011 at 1,300, according to the average
estimate of 12 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. The last time
they were this bullish in October was 2008, when the group
predicted a 27 percent gain and the index lost 18 percent.  Trading Range  Excluding its dip to a 13-month closing low of 1,099.23 on
Oct. 3, the S&P 500 has mostly traded between about 1,120 and
1,220 for the past two months. Following 14 periods since 1990
when the index was stuck in a range, more than 75 percent
resulted in gains in the next one, three and six months,
according to Birinyi Associates Inc., the Westport, Connecticut-
based money management and research firm. The average trading
range studied lasted about seven months, with the shortest
beginning in March 1998 and lasting three months, Birinyi data
show.  “We’ll need clear economic data or policy movements out of
Europe to break out of that range,” Wasif Latif, vice president
of equity investments at USAA Investment Management Co. in  San
Antonio , which oversees about $50 billion, said in a telephone
interview.  Earnings Season  Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, will mark
the unofficial start of the earnings-reporting season when it
reports results on Oct. 11. Third-quarter profits for S&P 500
companies are projected to have grown 13 percent, according to
analyst forecast compiled by Bloomberg, down from an estimate of
17 percent when the index traded at a three-year high at the end
of April.  Among European stocks, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole SA
and Natixis surged at least 5.3 percent after Le Figaro said the
French government is working on a contingency plan to take
stakes in the country’s lenders. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
biggest mining company, rallied 5.9 percent as metal prices
increased. SABMiller Plc surged 7 percent after a report by
Brazilian news website IG said the brewer is in talks to be
bought by Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. Spokespeople for both
companies declined to comment.  Bonds, Currencies  Ten-year Spanish and Italian bond yields decreased seven
basis points each, while rates on U.K., French and German debt
rose at least four points.  The dollar weakened against 14 of 16 major peers today,
with the Brazilian real surging 2.7 percent to lead gains after
higher-than-forecast inflation spurred bets the central bank may
slow the pace of interest-rate cuts.  The euro strengthened versus 10 of 16 major peers. The
pound slid against all 16 major peers after the  Bank of England 
expanded its bond-purchase program. The Australian and New
Zealand currencies strengthened against most peers.  Copper futures climbed 4.5 percent to $3.2465 a pound in
 New York  and rallied 5.9 percent in  London  to lead gains in 19
of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI Index.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks surged 3.7
percent, extending its rebound from a two-year low on Oct. 4.
Benchmark indexes in  South Korea ,  Brazil  and  Chile  climbed at
least 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
