dollars rose for a fourth day against the U.S. currency after a
government report showed American employers added more jobs in

rally we’ve seen this week and a softer  U.S. dollar ,” said  Mary Nicola , a New York-based currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA,
referring to the U.S. jobs data.  It was the longest winning streak in more than a month for
the two currencies. The Aussie rose against the majority of its
