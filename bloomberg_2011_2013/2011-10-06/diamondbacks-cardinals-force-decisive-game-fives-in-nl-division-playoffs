Ryan Roberts hit a first-inning grand
slam to start the Arizona Diamondbacks toward a 10-6 win against
the  Milwaukee Brewers , forcing a decisive Game 5 in their
National League Division Series.  The Diamondbacks, who won two games in Phoenix to even the
best-of-five series after losing the first two on the road, will
face the Brewers again tomorrow at Milwaukee’s Miller Park.  The other National League first-round series also is headed
for a fifth game. David Freese drove in four runs with
a two-run homer and a two-run double as the  St. Louis Cardinals 
won 5-3 yesterday to even their series against the Phillies. The
teams meet tomorrow night in Philadelphia.  In the American League, the Texas Rangers already have won
their series 3-1 against the Tampa Bay Rays and await the winner
of tonight’s Game 5 in  New York  between the Yankees and the
Detroit Tigers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
