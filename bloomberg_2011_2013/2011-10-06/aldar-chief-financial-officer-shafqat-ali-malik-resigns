Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR) , an  Abu Dhabi 
developer that’s had three chief executive officers in four
years, said Chief Financial Officer Shafqat Ali Malik resigned.  Malik will continue in his role until the end of October,
the company said in a  statement  to the Abu Dhabi bourse today.
Aldar is in the process of selecting a replacement to Malik, who
quit to “pursue other opportunities,” it said.  Aldar, which is building thousands of homes and offices
across the  United Arab Emirates ’ capital Abu Dhabi, in January
agreed to sell assets including a Ferrari theme park and
convertible bonds to the Abu Dhabi government for 19.2 billion
dirhams ($5.23 billion) to pay creditors. Property values and
rents slumped in the U.A.E. after banks curtailed lending and
speculators left the market during the global recession.  Aldar reported a profit of 127.3 million dirhams in the
second quarter after a loss of 475.3 million dirhams a year
earlier. The shares have dropped 51 percent this year, compared
with a 8.3 percent decline in the benchmark  ADX General Index. (ADSMI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
