Treasuries dropped for a third day as
speculation European leaders are stepping up efforts to resolve
the sovereign-debt crisis pared refuge demand.  Yields on 30-year bonds extended their increase from a two-
year low after a report before tomorrow’s U.S. payrolls figures
showed initial jobless claims rose less than forecast and
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said banks have
strengthened. The  European Central Bank  will resume covered-bond
purchases and reintroduce year-long loans for financial
institutions to avoid a freezing of money markets.  “With the slight optimism coming out of  Europe , we are
seeing some glimmers of what we could expect in the Treasury
market if we get some type of reasonable policy response,” said
 Kevin Flanagan , chief fixed-income strategist in Purchase, New
York, at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. “There is still a lot of
global issues to be worked through.”  Yields on 30-year bonds increased 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 2.95 percent at 5:04 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.75 percent
securities maturing in August 2041 fell 2 5/32, or $21.56 per
$1,000 face amount, to 115 25/32. Yields slid two days ago to
2.69 percent, the lowest level since January 2009.  A drop of almost one point in 10-year notes pushed yields
up 10 basis points to 1.99 percent today, compared with a record
low 1.6714 percent set on Sept. 23. Two-year yields rose one
basis point to 0.26 percent.  ‘Bring In Sellers’  “The markets have been pricing in a double dip, and the
possibility of us not going down that route will bring in
sellers,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading
in  New York  at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a brokerage for
institutional investors.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced for a third day,
rising 1.8 percent. Crude oil for November delivery increased
3.7 percent to $82.59 a barrel in New York.  Geithner told the Senate Banking Committee the nation’s
financial firms have strengthened and there’s “absolutely” no
chance of another collapse like the fall of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008.  U.S. government securities surged last quarter on
speculation  Greece  was heading for a default and as the  Federal
Reserve  announced its plan to replace shorter-term Treasuries
with longer maturities to keep borrowing costs low.  Yields on 30-year bonds decreased 146 basis points in the
third quarter, the most since falling 164 basis points in the
last three months of December 2008.  Pimco Performance  Bill Gross ’s Pacific Investment Management Co. Total Return
Fund, the world’s biggest mutual fund, is trailing the Vanguard
Intermediate Term Bond Fund, an index fund, as some of the top
investors were blindsided by the bond rally.  The Fed said on Sept. 21 that it would buy $400 billion of
 U.S. debt  with maturities of six to 30 years through June while
selling an equal amount of securities due in three years or
less. It sold $8.87 billion of notes maturing from January to
July 2012 today under what’s known as Operation Twist.  The central bank has an “implicit target” for 10-year
note yields of 1.50 percent or less, Dominic Konstam, global
head of rates research at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, wrote in
a report sent via e-mail yesterday.  Mortgage rates  in the U.S. have fallen, sending longer-term
borrowing costs below 4 percent for the first time on record.
The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan dropped to 3.94
percent in the week ended today from 4.01 percent,  Freddie Mac 
said in a statement. That’s the lowest in the McLean, Virginia,
company’s records dating to 1971.  Jobless Claims  Applications for jobless benefits rose to 401,000 in the
week ended Oct. 1 from a revised 395,000 in the previous week,
the Labor Department reported. The median forecast of 50
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase to
410,000 from a previously reported 391,000.  Nonfarm payrolls climbed by 55,000 workers last month after
zero growth in August, according to the median forecast of 91
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before tomorrow’s report
from the Labor Department.  “The big event of the week is going to be what we see in
tomorrow’s jobs data,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond
strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“The market doesn’t seem to want to take any big bets before
that.”  The Treasury Department announced today it plans to sell
$32 billion of three-year notes, $21 billion of 10-year debt and
$13 billion of 30-year bonds in auctions next week.  Covered Bonds  The ECB will spend 40 billion euros ($53 billion) on
covered bonds starting next month and will offer banks two
additional unlimited loans of 12- and 13-month durations, ECB
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said at a press conference in
Berlin after policy makers left the benchmark  interest rate  at
1.50 percent. Trichet will be succeeded by Italy’s  Mario Draghi 
when his eight-year term expires Oct. 31.  The  Bank of England ’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee
raised the ceiling for debt purchases known as quantitative
easing to 275 billion pounds ($421 billion) from 200 billion
pounds. That’s the biggest expansion since the first round of
stimulus in March 2009. The central bank last announced an
increase in its bond program in November 2009, and the purchases
ended in early 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
