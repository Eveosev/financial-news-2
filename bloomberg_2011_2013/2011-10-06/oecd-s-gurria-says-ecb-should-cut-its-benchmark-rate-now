The  European Central Bank  should cut
its benchmark interest rate today and authorities should
introduce new bank stress tests that fully take into account a
sovereign default, said  Angel Gurria , secretary general of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  “We believe there is space,” Gurria said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television’s Francine Lacqua in Berlin. “There
can be a reduction in  interest rates  both to signal that the
authorities are vigilant and that there is concern about the
robustness of the recovery.”  Cutting rates today would also “make things easier for
Mario” Draghi, the Bank of Italy governor who will succeed
Jean-Claude Trichet as ECB head on Nov. 1, Gurria said.  Gurria also said that European banks should be subjected to
additional stress tests that “fully take into consideration the
impact of sovereign debt.”  The stress tests conducted earlier this year “did not
provide confidence to markets,” because they did not clearly
gauge the effects of a sovereign default, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
