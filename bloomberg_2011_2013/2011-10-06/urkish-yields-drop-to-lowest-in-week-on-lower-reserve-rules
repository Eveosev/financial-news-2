Turkish bond yields fell to the
lowest in a week after the central bank lowered  reserve
requirements  on some lira deposits and securities.  Yields on benchmark two-year debt dropped 17 basis points
to 8.37 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Istanbul, Bloomberg data
showed. That’s the lowest level since Sept. 29, according to a
Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS index.  The lowered bank reserve requirements will  inject  3.2
billion liras ($1.7 billion) of liquidity into the market,
according to an e-mailed statement by policy makers in Ankara.
The steps are effective as of Oct. 14, it said.  “The bond yields have moved down after the announcement as
the central bank is injecting liquidity into the market with
this move,” Onur Aydogan, head of fixed-income trading at ING
Bank AS, said in e-mailed comments.  The central bank cut yesterday the foreign-currency
reserves that banks must deposit against their liabilities
yesterday, freeing up $1.3 billion in liquidity in a move to
bolster the lira, which depreciated to a record low on Oct. 4.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Turkish dollar
bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries narrowed 24 basis points to
347, compared with a 13 basis-point fall for emerging-market
debt, JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
