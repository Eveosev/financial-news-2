Porsche AG is incurring
“significant” charges over engine and parts purchases from
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  because of the stalled merger with the German
carmaker,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing Chief Executive Officer
 Matthias Mueller .  VW and Porsche are forced to treat each other as
competitors for as long as their planned merger isn’t completed,
the newspaper said, citing Mueller. The CEO said both companies
are charging each other a “profit premium” when buying
components from one another.  To contact the reporters on this story:
