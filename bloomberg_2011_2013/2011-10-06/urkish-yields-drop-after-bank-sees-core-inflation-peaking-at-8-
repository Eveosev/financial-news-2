Turkish bond yields declined after
the central bank said it expected core inflation to peak at 8
percent in the fourth quarter.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt fell 11 basis points to
8.43 percent at 11:29 a.m. in Istanbul.  The central bankâ€™s preferred measure of core inflation,
which excludes energy, food, tobacco and gold prices, jumped to
a 2 1/2-year high of 7 percent in September from 6.2 percent a
month earlier, the statistics agency said on Oct. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
