Greggs Plc (GRG) , the U.K.’s biggest bakery
chain, advanced the most in almost seven months after saying
that sales growth accelerated in the fiscal third quarter as it
sold more meal deals and breakfast items.  Greggs rose 4.8 percent, the most since March, to close at
483.2 pence at 4:30 p.m. in London. Revenue climbed 5.4 percent
in the 13 weeks ended Oct. 1, the  Newcastle Upon Tyne , England-
based company said today in a statement. Sales in shops open at
least a year rose 0.8 percent over the same period. Sales on
that basis increased 0.6 percent in the 39 weeks to Oct. 1.  Britain’s largest supermarket chain  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  and
 Mothercare Plc (MTC)  reported weaker sales yesterday as  consumer
spending  contracts, while inflation accelerates and wages remain
stagnant. U.K. economic growth in the second quarter slowed more
than initially estimated, as consumer spending fell 0.8 percent,
the Office for National Statistics said yesterday.  “Our performance has been resilient in a tough market,”
Chief Executive Officer Ken McMeikan said in a telephone
interview today. “Most items at Greggs tend to be low-priced.”  Consumers are shifting into lower priced baked food such as
sausage rolls which are performing well, he said.  The company will increase investment in promotional
activities, including meal deals and discounts, McMeikan said.
Greggs said it plans to open 80 net new stores this year. The
baker has added a net 53 shops in the year to date, taking the
total number of outlets to 1,540 as of Oct. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
