France  will double a proposed tax on
sugary drinks, including soft drinks, sweetened juices and
waters, raising 240 million euros ($320 million), Le Figaro
reported today, citing Budget Minister Valerie Pecresse.  The additional tax on a 33-centiliter can of soda will be 2
cents rather than 1 cent, costing  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  80 million euros
extra, the newspaper said. The tax wonâ€™t apply to diet sodas or
sugar-free juices, Le Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
