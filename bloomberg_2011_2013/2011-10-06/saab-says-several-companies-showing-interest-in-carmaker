Saab Automobile said companies are
“showing interest” in partnering with the Swedish carmaker as
it works through a court-approved reorganization.  “Several companies are showing interest in Saab right
now,” spokesman  Eric Geers  said by telephone. “We of course
have a binding agreement with Pangda and Youngman.”  Saab expects Chinese authorities to make a ruling on the
proposed partnerships with Pangda Automobile Trade Co. and
Zhejiang Youngman on Oct. 14, Geers said.  Saab, which  General Motors Co. (GM)  sold last year, is going
through a financial reorganization in  Sweden  after first halting
production in late March because suppliers stopped delivering
parts. Assembly at the main factory in Trollhaettan has been
quiet since early June. In August, the carmaker delayed paying
wages for the third consecutive month.  Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., which owns Swedish rival
Volvo Cars Corp., is in talks to acquire  Saab Automobile , Dagens
Nyheter reported today. Geely declined to comment on the story.  Swedish Automobile NV, Saab’s parent, advanced as much as
15 cents, or 18 percent, to 97 cents and was up 9.8 percent as
of 10:33 a.m. in Amsterdam trading. The shares have dropped 74
percent this year, valuing the Zeewolde, Netherlands-based
company at 24.7 million euros ($33 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
