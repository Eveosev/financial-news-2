German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
policy makers need to “look again” at whether European banks
need additional capital.  Experts who say the banks are undercapitalized must be
taken “very seriously” and if it turns out that banks need
more capital “then it’s money well-invested,” Merkel told
reporters in Berlin today. “At that point, we shouldn’t
hesitate.” In the first instance, it’s up to banks themselves
to make sure they are sufficiently capitalized, she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
