Greece â€™s voluntary debt swap, part of
a second financing package for the country, will be completed by
mid-December, state-run Athens News Agency reported, without
saying how it got the information.  Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos told a meeting of
ruling party lawmakers that the debt-swap procedures and the
implementation of the July 21 financing agreement were
effectively frozen until a German proposal for bigger losses for
bondholders is discussed, according to the newswire.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
