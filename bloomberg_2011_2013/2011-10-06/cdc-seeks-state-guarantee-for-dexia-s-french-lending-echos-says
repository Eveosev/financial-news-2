Caisse des Depots et Consignations,
seeking to keep its AAA rating, is asking the French government
to guarantee a portfolio of  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s municipal lending that
the state-owned bank may take over,  Les Echos  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The investment committee of CDC’s supervisory commission,
chaired by lawmaker Michel Bouvard, met yesterday and is
opposing a plan to take over Dexia’s French municipal-lending
business, Les Echos said. The plan would see CDC buying 70
percent of Dexia Municipal Agency, or DexMa, Dexia’s refinancing
unit which carries about 80 billion euros ($107 billion) of
lending to local governments, Les Echos said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
