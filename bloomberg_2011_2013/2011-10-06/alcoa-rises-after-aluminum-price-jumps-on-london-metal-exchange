Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, jumped after the price of the metal rose the most in
10 months in London trading.  Alcoa gained 51 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $9.88 as of 4:15
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. Aluminum for
delivery in three months increased as much as 3.4 percent to
$2,244.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the biggest
intraday increase since Dec. 1.  Alcoa Chief Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  said in July
global aluminum demand will increase 12 percent in 2011 and
double by the end of the decade as Asian countries build more
office blocks and buy more aircraft, cars and trains. Alcoa said
last month it’s spending $300 million to expand its Davenport,
Iowa, rolled-products plant to meet rising demand from
automakers.  “They can talk about aerospace and automobiles all the
time, that’s not going to be what really moves the needle,”
Chuck Bradford, a metals analyst at Bradford Research Inc. in
New York, said in an interview. “It’s the metal price.”  Alcoa, which is based in New York, is scheduled to publish
its third-quarter earnings after the close of trading on Oct.
11. It’s traditionally the first company in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  to report earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
