Pakistan ’s  Muttahida Qaumi Movement ,
which quit Prime Minister  Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani ’s cabinet in
June, returned to the government yesterday, further
strengthening the majority of the ruling  Pakistan Peoples Party .  “The alliance between the MQM and PPP has taken this
decision in the best interests of the country and people,” MQM
chief Altaf Hussain said in a statement issued from the party’s
London office late last night.  The MQM is the fourth-largest party in the country’s 342-
member National Assembly with 25 members.  The third-largest party, the  Pakistan Muslim League  (Quaid)
led by Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, also reaffirmed its support for
the coalition after overcoming differences in a meeting with
President Asif Ali Zardari yesterday, according to Chaudhry
Shahbaz Goshi, a vice president of the party. The group had
threatened to quit the government.  The 125-member Peoples Party needs support from allies to
overcome opposition from the rival  Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ,
the second-largest party with 91 members, according to the
country’s  Election Commission .  To contact the reporter on this story:
