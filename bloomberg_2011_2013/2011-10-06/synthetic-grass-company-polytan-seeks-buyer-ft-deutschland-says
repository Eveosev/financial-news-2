Polytan GmbHâ€™s owners IK Investment
Partners have hired Macquarie to find a buyer for the German
maker of synthetic grass,  Financial Times Deutschland  said,
without saying where it got the information.  Polytan is valued at 300 million euros ($400 million) to
350 million euros including debt, the German newspaper said,
citing unidentified people from the financial industry. The
deadline to submit a bid was about two weeks ago and the auction
is now in the second round, FTD said.  The maker of synthetic grass for football and hockey
stadiums has annual sales of about 300 million euros and
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of
about 40 million euros, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
