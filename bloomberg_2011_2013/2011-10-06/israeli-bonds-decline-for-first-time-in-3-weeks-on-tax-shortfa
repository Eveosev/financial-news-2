Israel ’s benchmark bond fell for the
first time in almost three weeks, lifting the yield from the
lowest since the note was sold, on speculation the government
will raise the amount of debt it issues as tax revenue dropped.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit bond due
January 2022 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
4.54 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. Revenue for the
first nine months of the year are 1.2 billion shekels ($322
million) below target, the  Finance Ministry  said today.  “Investors are afraid of an excess of issues,” Assaf Rosenberg, head of fixed-income sales at Excellence Nessuah
Investment House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan , Israel, said by telephone.  Total-tax revenue fell to 17.2 billion shekels in September
from 17.4 billion shekels a year earlier, the Finance Ministry
said today. The ministry plans to raise 6 billion shekels from
debt auctions in October, the largest monthly amount this year,
according to data from the ministry posted on Bloomberg.  The shekel strengthened for a third day, rising 0.2 percent
to 3.7130 per dollar at 4:52 p.m. It has declined 3.5 percent in
the past 12 months, making it the best performer among 10
emerging markets in  Europe , the  Middle East  and Africa tracked
by Bloomberg.  Foreign currency reserves declined to $76.3 billion in
September, the  Bank of Israel  said today, the lowest level in
six months.  Lower Rates  Two-year  interest-rate  swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, declined four basis
points to 2.68 percent. Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer
cut the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 3 percent
on Sept. 26 as inflation slowed, growth eased and Europe, one of
the country’s key export markets, grappled with its debt crisis.
Goldman Sachs said Sept. 27 the benchmark lending rate may
decline to 2.5 percent by year end, while Citigroup Inc. has
forecast another quarter-point cut this year.  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the period, declined 2 basis
points to 178, implying an average annual inflation rate of 1.78
percent. Inflation-linked bonds due June 2013 rose for a second
day, pushing the yield down three basis points to 1.12 percent.  The Tel-Bond 40 index of corporate bonds declined 0.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
