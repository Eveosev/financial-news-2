Hurricane Philippe formed in the
Atlantic southeast of  Bermuda  while Tropical Storm Irwin
developed in the Pacific off the southwestern coast of  Mexico ,
according to the  U.S. National Hurricane Center .  Philippe’s top winds reached 80 miles (129 kilometers) per
hour 425 miles southeast of the islands on a course to the
north-northeast that will keep it away from land, the hurricane
center said.  “After 49 previous advisories, over 12 days, Philippe has
finally become a hurricane,” the center said in a forecast
analysis. “This peak will likely be short-lived.”  Philippe is the 16th named storm of the June-to-November
Atlantic season and the fifth to grow to hurricane strength with
winds of at least 74 mph. An average Atlantic season produces 11
storms, according to the center.  Tropical Storm Irwin, the ninth named storm of the eastern
Pacific season, is located  855 miles  south-southwest of the tip
of  Baja California  and is forecast to move in a circular pattern
without threatening land through the next five days.  Irwin’s top winds are 40 mph, just above the 39-mph
threshold a storm needs to receive a name from the Miami-based
hurricane center.  Following Irwin is Tropical Depression 10, 540 miles south-
southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, with winds of 35 mph. The
depression is expected to become Tropical Storm Jova today, the
hurricane center said.  According to the center’s  forecast track , Jova may grow
into a hurricane next week and strike Mexico’s Pacific coast
near Puerto Vallarta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
