The rand is poised to weaken against
the lira as  Turkey ’s central bank sells more dollars to curb the
currency’s drop and  South Africa ’s Reserve Bank refrains from
stemming the rand’s decline, Societe General SA said.  Investors should sell the rand for the lira at 4.33 on
anticipation the South African currency will weaken to 4.60,
Guillaume Salomon, a London-based emerging-markets fixed-income
and currency strategist, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Turkish policy makers offered to sell as much as $1.35
billion for liras today, matching yesterday’s offer, the biggest
since daily auctions started on Aug. 5. The lira sank 16 percent
against the dollar this year, the second-worst performance among
more than 20 emerging-market currencies after the rand’s 17
percent decline. South Africa’s central bank doesn’t target a
level for the rand and won’t intervene to weaken or strengthen
the  exchange rate , Governor Gill Marcus said Sept. 22.  “The Turkish central bank has ‘re-engaged’ itself in a
battle with the market to try and stem the lira’s depreciation
and that it stands ready to use additional tools,” Salomon
wrote. “Concerns about foreign bond holdings of rand-
denominated bonds and a central bank generally happy with an
orderly depreciation of the rand make the rand vulnerable,
making a long lira-short rand an interesting offer.”  Investors who sell short hope to profit by borrowing assets,
selling them and then repurchasing them at a lower price before
returning them to the holder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
