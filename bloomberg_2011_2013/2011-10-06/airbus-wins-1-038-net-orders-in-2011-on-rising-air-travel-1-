Airbus SAS said it won 1,038 aircraft
orders so far this year, outselling  Boeing Co. (BA)  and edging within
reach of a record annual intake following introduction of the
A320neo single-aisle plane.  The gross intake was 1,179 new purchase contracts, with 141
cancellations in the first nine months of the year, Toulouse,
France-based Airbus said today in a statement. That includes 918
neos, a version of Airbus’s single-aisle plane with more fuel-
efficient engines. Airbus today won an order for 110 A320s from
 Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) , to be included in the October tally.  Airbus’s record tally for net new orders was in 2007, with
contracts for 1,341. The Qantas order booked today plus the
prospect of additional orders at the Dubai Air Show in November
put Airbus within reach of topping the record.  Boeing won 531 gross orders, or 426 after subtracting
canceled contracts, according to a listing today on the Chicago-
based planemaker’s website. Cancellations, generally for planes
ordered some years ago, are counted against the current year
tally. Net orders are up from 392 a year earlier.  Double-Decker Deliveries  For deliveries, Airbus this year has handed over 374
planes, including 296 single aisle planes, 62 widebodies, and 16
A380s. Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co., is aiming to deliver about 530 planes this year, including
about 25 double-decker A380s. The next A380 delivery is to China
Southern Airlines Co., set for next week.  Airbus’s tally so far is again more than Boeing, which it
has beat in deliveries every year since 2003. Boeing had handed
over 349 aircraft through September, according to a statement
today, and forecasts deliveries of 485 to 495 planes in 2011. In
the third quarter, deliveries rose to 127 from 124 a year
earlier. Planemakers get about 40 percent of their payments from
customers upon delivery.  While Airbus has booked 918 firm orders from 14 customers
for its A320neo since putting the plane on offer last December,
Boeing hasn’t yet won any firm contracts for its 737 MAX. The
company has said it has 496 preliminary commitments from five
customers.  Boeing in August announced its intention to build the plane
and has been working to complete its configuration.  “We continue to work a number of details,” a Boeing
spokesman,  Marc Birtel , said yesterday. “These commitments will
book once those details are finalized, but we are not able to
speculate on when that will be.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
