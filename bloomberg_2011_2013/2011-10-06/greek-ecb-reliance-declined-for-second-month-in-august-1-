Greek banks’ reliance on European
Central Bank financing declined for a second month in August,
the  central bank said .  Greek bank use of European Central Bank liquidity fell to
93.1 billion euros (124.9$ billion) in August from 96.3 billion
euros the previous month, according to a statement posted on the
Athens-based central bank’s website today. The reliance on
emergency liquidity assistance, or ELA, was 6.4 billion euros in
the month, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Greece  has committed to additional measures to secure a
second bailout worth 159 billion euros after the European Union-
led aid package of 110 billion euros agreed in May 2010 failed
to convince investors the country could avoid a default.  The balance of deposits held by businesses and households
in Greek banks rose to 188.6 billion euros in August from 187.2
billion euros in July, according to a separate statement from
the  Bank of Greece (TELL)  today. That was the first rise this year.  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said in August
there was a “clear return” of deposits to Greek banks for the
first time in 2 1/2 years.  Deposits by homes and businesses have declined 20.9 billion
euros since December 2010, or 10 percent, as the economy shrinks
under the weight of government-imposed austerity measures agreed
in exchange for international financing. The economy is forecast
to contract 5.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and
2.5 percent next year, according to the 2012 budget draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
