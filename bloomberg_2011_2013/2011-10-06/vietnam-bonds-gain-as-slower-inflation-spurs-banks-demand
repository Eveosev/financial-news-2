Vietnam ’s  government bonds  advanced,
pushing their yield to the lowest level since May, amid
speculation banks are pouring more funds into the securities as
inflation eases. The dong strengthened.  Consumer-prices increased 22.4 percent from a year earlier
in September following a 23 percent jump in August that was the
biggest since 2008, according to government data released Sept.
24. That was the first decline in the inflation rate since
August 2010.  “Thanks to decelerating inflation, expectations about
decreasing interest rates encouraged banks to purchase more
government bonds,” Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co. said
in a research note today.  The yield on the three-year government bond dropped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.29 percent,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong gained 0.1 percent to 20,828 per dollar as of 3:50
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,648 per dollar today,
according to its website. It adjusted the rate to 20,638
yesterday from 20,628, the first adjustment since Aug. 24. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  “The central bank and commercial banks will continue
selling dollars to intervene in the market, fully meeting the
economy’s necessary demand for foreign currency,” the  State
Bank  of Vietnam said in a statement on its website late
yesterday.  The monetary authority reiterated its determination to
stabilize the  exchange rate  through year-end, saying the
official fixing won’t be adjusted by more than 1 percent during
that time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
