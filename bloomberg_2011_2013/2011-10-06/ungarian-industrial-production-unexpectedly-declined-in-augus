Hungary ’s industrial production
unexpectedly declined in August, adding to evidence that the
economic recovery from the worst recession in 18 years is
petering out.  Production dropped a workday-adjusted 0.4 percent from a
year earlier, compared with a 2.7 percent increase in July, the
statistics office in Budapest said in a preliminary report
today. The median estimate of 14 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for growth of 1.3 percent.  “This fits into the pattern of the past six months in
which exports, which were once the engine of growth, are slowing
because of lower demand abroad,” statistician Miklos Schindele
told reporters.  Exports to the euro region fueled Hungary’s recovery from
its worst recession since 1991 years, propelling the economy to
the fastest growth since 2006 in the first quarter as factories
such as Audi AG and  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  boosted production. Hungary’s
growth halted in the second quarter as the global economic
revival faltered, cutting demand for the nation’s exports.  The government has lowered its growth forecast to 1.5
percent for next year from 3 percent. The central bank estimates
the expansion may slow to 1 percent in 2012 from 1.6 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
