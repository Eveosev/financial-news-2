Vice President  Joe Biden  said  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  and other financial institutions are “tone deaf”
for planning new debit-card fees on consumers.  Biden, answering questions at a forum in  Washington , joined
with other officials, including President  Barack Obama , in
criticizing the charges, saying they have provoked an
“overwhelming, gut reaction” from the public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
