Tanzania’s shilling depreciated for
the third day as manufacturers increased demand for dollars.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy lost
as much as 0.8 percent at 1,687 per dollar, and traded down 0.1
percent at 1,675 by 12:33 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the commercial
capital.  “We have seen demand come in from the manufacturing sector
today,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of Commerce
Ltd., Absa Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone from Dar
es Salaam.  Tanzania exported $242.2 million worth of manufactured
goods in three months through June compared to $206.1 million in
the previous quarter, according to a report e-mailed from Bank
of Tanzania Sept. 19. Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 14.1
percent in August on higher energy and food costs, the National
Bureau of Statistics said Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
