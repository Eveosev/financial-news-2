Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , the South
African retailer controlled by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , plans to
build supply bases in the African nations where it operates,
even as South Africa objects to Wal-Mart’s acquisition of the
company.  Three South African government ministers this week asked
the country’s Competition Tribunal to reconsider Bentonville,
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart’s purchase of Massmart, citing fears
that local jobs may be lost.  “We have a strong belief and confidence in the potential
of the local supplier base,” Massmart Chief Executive Officer
Grant Pattison told reporters in Johannesburg today. “We don’t
disagree with the ministers that the issue of local suppliers is
important, but we disagree that we are the one that is going to
cause” a decline in the local supply base.  Massmart,  South Africa ’s biggest food and general goods
wholesaler, operates in 13 countries, including Botswana,
 Nigeria , Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia.  The Johannesburg-based company will “shortly” ask for a
meeting with South Africa’s competition commission “to align
expectations before meeting with the commission in July,”
Pattison said.  The “review and appeal” requested by Economic Development
Minister Ebrahim Patel, Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies
and Forestry and Fisheries Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson will
be heard by the Competition Appeal Court on Oct. 20 and 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
