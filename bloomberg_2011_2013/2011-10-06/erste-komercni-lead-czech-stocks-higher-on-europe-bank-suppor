Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  jumped a second
day in Prague, the biggest one-day advance in more than a week,
and  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  rose on speculation that the euro-area’s
debt crisis will be contained.  Austria’s Erste climbed 11 percent to 496 koruna, the
steepest jump on a closing basis since Sept. 26, at 11:04 a.m.
in Prague. Komercni, Societe Generale SA’s Czech unit, advanced
3.5 percent to 3,380 koruna. Those movements pushed the PX
equity gauge, where Erste and Komercni have a combined 39
percent of the weighting, 3.6 percent higher to 931.9.  Financial firms were among the biggest gainers as European
shares rose while investors awaited the European Central Bank’s
decision on  interest rates  and amid speculation that policy
makers are working on plans to recapitalize banks. BNP Paribas
SA, Credit Agricole SA and Natixis rose after Le Figaro said the
French government is working on a contingency plan to take
stakes in the country’s lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
