The probability of the  Bank of
England  expanding its so-called quantitative easing program
today is about 40 percent, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  “Our official call remains for no additional QE today,”
London-based Deutsche Bank economist  George Buckley  said in an
e-mailed note to clients. “However, there are sizable risks to
this view.”  “To put a number on this, we’d argue about 40 percent,”
he said. “Market participants probably think that the risks are
even higher than this for more QE today.”  “Assuming no move from the Monetary Policy Committee
today, we expect the bank to sanction 50 billion pounds of QE at
the November meeting, to be conducted over the following three
months,” Buckley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
