South Korea ’s current-account surplus
probably widened in September from August as exports to the
U.S., European Union and Southeast Asian countries increased,
the finance ministry said.  The economy faces high uncertainties due to the global
fiscal crisis and unstable financial markets and the government
will continue efforts to sustain the economic recovery and ease
“still-high” inflation, the ministry said in a monthly
economic report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
