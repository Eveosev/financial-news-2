Crude oil from the  Middle East  for
sale to  Asia  fell to a discount against its benchmark after
producers raised official selling prices.  Lower Zakum, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.,
dropped 6 cents to a discount of 3 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Qatar Land declined 11 cents to a discount of 8 cents a barrel,
Bloomberg data showed.  Both grades had their official prices raised this week to
the highest against benchmark Dubai since May. The increases
came as prompt prices for Dubai have risen compared with later
dated supplies, a market situation known as backwardation that
suggest demand is greater for immediate shipments.  Dubai swaps for December narrowed to a premium of 92 cents
a barrel today over January after reaching a two-week high
yesterday of 96 cents, according to data from London-based
brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Oman crude for immediate loading increased $2.63, or 2.7
percent, to $99.82 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in December rose 2.7 percent to $99.24. Murban for
spot delivery climbed 2.5 percent to $103.85.  Oman futures for December delivery gained 45 cents to
$99.95 a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 4:59 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,246 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $100.14 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The November Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
widened 7 cents to $5.12 a barrel, according to data from PVM.
The exchange for swaps for December rose 11 cents to $4.22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
