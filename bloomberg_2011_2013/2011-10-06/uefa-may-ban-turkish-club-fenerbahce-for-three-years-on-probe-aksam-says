UEFA,  Europe ’s top soccer authority,
may ban Fenerbahce from its competitions for three years if
Turkish authorities find the league champion guilty in a match-
fixing probe, Aksam reported.  Penalties for such crimes range from one to five years, and
because the Istanbul-based club didn’t voluntarily withdraw from
the  Champions League , Europe’s top soccer competition, it missed
an opportunity to disqualify for one year, Aksam said, citing
UEFA regulations. The football association will reach a decision
by May and a three-year ban might cost Fenerbahce more than 100
million euros ($133.5 million) of revenue, Aksam reported.  The Turkish Football Federation withdrew Fenerbahce and
sent runner-up Trabzonspor to the competition. That team and cup
winner Besiktas, which is competing in the UEFA Cup, may be
banned from European competitions for long as five years if
found guilty of rigging matches, Aksam reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
