The Bank of  Thailand  should lower the
nation’s  interest rates  to help business operators coping with
the flooding impact, according to Deputy Prime Minister
and Commerce Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong.  Business leaders have asked the government to offer loans
with low interest rates to help those affected by the floods, he
told reporters today in Bangkok after meeting with
representatives from the Federation of Thai Industries.  “The first thing we should do is the central bank should
cut interest rates,” Kittiratt said. “This is the message I
want to convey to them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
