South  Sudan  expects to earn $2.14
billion from the sale of oil to customers in Asia and  Europe 
since it gained independence in July, the Petroleum Ministry
said.  The East African nation signed contracts for the sale of 22
million barrels of crude for export in the three-month period
through October, the Juba-based ministry said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  South Sudan gained control of about 75 percent of Sudan’s
daily oil production of 490,000 barrels when it became
independent. The crude, pumped mainly by China National
Petroleum Corp., Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd and  India ’s
Oil & Natural Gas Corp., is exported through a pipeline that
runs to Port Sudan on the Red Sea.  Oil earnings accounted for about 98 percent of South
Sudan’s 2010 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
