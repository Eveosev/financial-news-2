AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest drugmaker, plans to eliminate 400 positions in the U.S.
as it prepares for competition from generic medicines.  AstraZeneca will cut the jobs at its Wilmington, Delaware,
location along with some “field-based, nonsales roles,” the
London-based company said today in a  statement  on its website.
About 70 of the positions to be reduced will come from existing
vacancies, the drugmaker said.  The company’s top seller, the cholesterol-lowering pill
Crestor, will face added competition later this year after
generic copies of  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Lipitor come on the market.
Crestor, which generated $5.69 billion in sales last year, will
lose patent protections in the U.S. as early as 2016. The job
reductions come atop 550 AstraZeneca announced for Wilmington
last year.  The move is “part of the company’s strategy to operate its
business more effectively and efficiently to best serve patients
in the  United States ,” AstraZeneca said in the statement. “The
changes will enable the company to compete in a challenging
environment, including pricing pressures and the continuing
growth of generic medicines.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
