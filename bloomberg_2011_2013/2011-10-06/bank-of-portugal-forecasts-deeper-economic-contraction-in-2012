Portugal ’s economy will contract more
than previously forecast in 2012 as export growth slows and
private consumption drops, the central bank said.  Gross domestic product will shrink 1.9 percent this year
and 2.2 percent in 2012 after expanding 1.4 percent in 2010, the
Bank of Portugal said today in its autumn economic bulletin. In
July, the central bank had forecast GDP would shrink 2 percent
this year and 1.8 percent in 2012.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending and
raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($104
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal
followed Greece and Ireland in April in seeking a bailout. The
government has already announced a one-time income-tax surcharge
to help cover a budget shortfall this year.  “The  budget deficit  objective for 2011 will only be met
with significant additional measures,” the central bank said in
the report.  The government doesn’t plan any more tax increases, Finance
Minister Vitor Gaspar said on Sept. 30. The government will rely
on the other measures it already announced to reach this year’s
deficit target, such as the transfer of some Portuguese banks’
pension funds, he said.  The government aims to trim the budget deficit from 9.8
percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.9 percent in 2011 and to within the
EU ceiling of 3 percent in 2013. Debt will reach 100.8 percent
of GDP this year and peak at 106.8 percent in 2013 before
starting to decline, the government predicted on Aug. 31. Debt
was 93.3 percent of GDP in 2010.  Portugal is “on track” to meet its 2011 deficit goal, a
team of EU and IMF inspectors said on Aug. 12. The IMF said in a
Sept. 13 report that the government needs to improve control
over expenditure and cut spending to meet its targets as it
seeks to regain access to bond markets in 2013.  The government forecasts the economy will contract 2.2
percent this year and between 2.2 percent and 2.3 percent in
2012, before expanding 1.2 percent in 2013.  The central bank estimates export growth of 6.7 percent in
2011 and 4.8 percent in 2012. Investment will drop 11.4 percent
in 2011 and 10.8 percent next year, while private consumption
will decline 3.8 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. It
projects inflation of 3.5 percent for this year and 2.4 percent
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
