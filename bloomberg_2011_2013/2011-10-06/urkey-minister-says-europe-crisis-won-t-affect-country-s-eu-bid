Turkey ’s Finance Minister Mehmet
Simsek said his country will maintain its bid to join the
European Union despite the region’s current debt crisis.  “Our desire to join the EU has less to do with short-term
economic gains,” he said at a panel discussion during the
Global Economic Symposium in Kiel,  Germany  today. “The fact
that a few countries on the periphery are struggling doesn’t
make  Europe  less appealing.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
