Greece ’s biggest private sector union
group, GSEE, said it won’t hold talks with European Union,
 European Central Bank  and International Monetary Fund
officials in Athens, the so-called troika, according to an e-
mailed statement from Athens-based GSEE today.  “Our red lines were crossed a long time ago and the
measures being proposed are completely opposed by Greeks,” GSEE
President Yiannis Panagopoulos said in a copy of a letter sent
to the troika in response to an invitation to hold talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
