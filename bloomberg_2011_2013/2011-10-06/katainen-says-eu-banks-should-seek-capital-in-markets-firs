Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen 
said  Europe  must make sure that its banks are sound, urging them
to seek private capital first before falling back on government
aid.  “We have to make sure that in this market pressure the
financial institutions are sound,” Katainen said at a press
conference with European Commission President  Jose Barroso  in
Brussels today. “Europe is full of good and sound banks but
they are suffering from the uncertainty.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
