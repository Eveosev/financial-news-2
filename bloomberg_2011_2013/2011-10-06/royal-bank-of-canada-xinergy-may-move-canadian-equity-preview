Canadian stocks fell, wiping out the
week’s gain, as raw-materials and energy shares dropped after
 Fitch Ratings  downgraded the government debt of  Spain  and  Italy .  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) ,  Canada ’s second-largest
energy company by market value, declined 4 percent as natural
gas futures retreated.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-biggest
gold producer by market value, lost 2.3 percent as precious
metals slipped. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s
largest fertilizer producer by market value, decreased 4.1
percent after a Citigroup Inc. analyst said U.S. ethanol
legislation may weaken grain prices.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index fell 191.71
points, or 1.6 percent, to 11,588.36 at the close in Toronto for
a weekly retreat of 0.3 percent.  “In the last few days, the markets had a bit of an upside,
but the cloud on  Europe  continues to be there,” Sadiq S. Adatia, chief investment officer at Sun Life Financial Inc.’s
Sun Life Global Investments unit, said in a telephone interview.
The unit oversees C$3.2 billion ($3.1 billion) for clients. “I
don’t think anyone is holding stocks for the long term. They’re
all worried about what’s going on in the economy.”  The index jumped 5.4 percent during the previous two days,
the most in a similar period since May 2009. Stocks rose from a
14-month low after the  Institute for Supply Management ’s monthly
index of the U.S. service industry fell less than most
economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast and investors
speculated European officials will reach an agreement to aid the
continent’s banks.  Debt Downgrades  Fitch reduced its ratings on Spain to AA- from AA+ and cut
Italy to A+ from AA-. The agency cited the vulnerability of the
countries to the European debt crisis.  The S&P/TSX Energy Index retreated for the first time in
four days as natural gas dropped to an 11-month low on
speculation U.S. inventories will approach a record.  Canadian Natural declined 4 percent to C$30.20.  Encana
Corp. (ECA) , the country’s largest natural gas producer, lost 4.6
percent to C$19.71. Oil-sands developer  MEG Energy Corp. (MEG) 
decreased 6.6 percent to C$37.74 after jumping 16 percent in the
previous two days.  Gold and silver retreated as investors sold precious metals
to cover losses in other assets, Adatia said. Goldcorp dropped
2.3 percent to C$48.12.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest
producer of the metal, lost 2.1 percent to C$48.44.  San Gold
Corp. (SGR) , which mines in Manitoba, slumped 8.6 percent to C$2.12
after reporting third-quarter production that trailed the
estimate of Andrew Kaip, an analyst at Bank of Montreal.  ‘Clear Negative’  Fertilizer producers fell after David Driscoll, an analyst
at Citigroup, said bills in Congress to reduce ethanol
requirements for gasoline represent “a continued assault on the
ethanol industry and a clear negative.” Corn futures also fell
on forecasts for warm, dry weather in the U.S. Midwest.  Potash Corp. declined 4.1 percent to C$46.40 after surging
11 percent in the previous two days.  Agrium Inc. (AGU) , a fertilizer
producer and farm retailer, lost 3.5 percent to C$71.16.  A gauge of base-metals and coal producers in the S&P/TSX
retreated 4.6 percent after soaring 24 percent, the most since
January 2009, in the previous three days.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest company in the
industry, decreased 4.7 percent to C$33.65.  Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN) ,
a copper and zinc producer, dropped 6.5 percent to C$49.21.
 Uranium One Inc. (UUU) , a mining company controlled by Moscow-based
ARMZ Uranium Holding, lost 6.6 percent to C$2.11.  Financials Retreat  The S&P/TSX Financials Index declined.  Royal Bank of
Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender by assets, slipped 1.4
percent to C$47.30. Bank of Nova Scotia, the country’s third-
biggest bank, fell 1.4 percent to C$51.78.  Manulife Financial
Corp. (MFC) ,  North America ’s fourth-biggest insurer, retreated 2.9
percent to C$11.88.  BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  dropped 4.3
percent to C$24.30 after soaring 19 percent from a seven-year
low in the previous four days. Microsoft Corp. is unlikely to
buy RIM, as Microsoft is reluctant to acquire a hardware
business and RIM’s chiefs would oppose a deal,  Pierre Ferragu ,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said in a note to
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
