The euro stayed lower against the
dollar and the yen after the  European Central Bank  left its
benchmark interest rate at 1.5 percent.  The euro weakened against 13 of its 16 major peers tracked
by Bloomberg. The central bank’s decision to leave the
refinancing rate on hold was in line with the median forecast of
52 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. ECB President Jean- Claude Trichet will hold a press conference at 2.30 p.m. in
Berlin. At the central bank’s previous monetary policy meeting
on Sept. 8, he said downside risks to the euro area’s economic
outlook had intensified.  ``The ECB's decision to leave rates on hold shouldn't
surprise the market,'' said  Jeremy Stretch , executive director
of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce in  London . ``Attention now turns to Trichet's press
conference for any announcement of more non-standard measures
to try to alleviate the depth of the sovereign-debt crisis.''  The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.3290 at 12:48 p.m. in
London. It fell to $1.3146 on Oct. 4, the weakest since Jan. 13.
The 17-nation common currency depreciated 0.7 percent to 101.84
yen. It dropped to as low as 100.76 on Oct. 4, the weakest since
June 2001.  The euro depreciated 1.5 percent to $1.3882 on Sept. 8 when
the ECB kept its main interest rate at 1.5 percent. It fell 1.2
percent to 107.59 yen that day.  The Frankfurt-based central bank raised rates twice this
year, by 25 basis points in April and July. It last reduced
 interest rates  in May 2009, when it cut its key rate to a record
low 1 percent.  The euro-area inflation rate jumped to 3 percent last month
from 2.5 percent in August, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said on Sept. 30 in an initial estimate.
That’s the biggest annual increase in consumer prices since
October 2008. Economists had projected inflation to hold at 2.5
percent. The central bank’s inflation ceiling rate is 2 percent.  “The sharp increase in inflation last month underlines the
difficulties facing the central bank,” CIBC’s Stretch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
