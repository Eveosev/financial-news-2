Israel  posted a budget deficit of 1.6
billion shekels ($430 million) in September as  tax revenue  fell.  Direct taxes, which have shown a “declining trend” since
June, were down 2 percent compared with the same month last
year, the  Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement. While
direct taxes have not fallen short of their estimate for the
first nine months, there is a 1.2 billion shekel shortfall in
overall revenue, it said.  The tax collection data was “disappointing,” said Modi Shafrir, chief economist at Tel Aviv-based I.L.S. Brokers Ltd.
“This is an additional indication that the labor market may be
softening and that growth may be slowing.”  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer , who had been
raising rates for more than two years to battle inflation,
reversed policy on Sept. 26 and cut the key rate by a quarter
percentage point to 3 percent, citing the worsening global
economic outlook. The bank is forecasting that growth will slow
to 3.2 percent in 2012, compared with a Central Bureau of
Statistics estimate of 5 percent growth for 2011.  The September figures brought the deficit for the first
nine months of the year to 9.7 billion shekels, compared with 14
billion shekels during the same period last year, the ministry
said. The 12-month budget deficit, which had been declining
since the beginning of the year, reversed trend and rose in
September, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
