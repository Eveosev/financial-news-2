The  Bank of England  said it saw
severe strains in bank funding markets as it raised its bond-
purchase program to 275 billion pounds.  “The squeeze on households’ real incomes and the fiscal
consolidation are likely to continue to weigh on domestic
spending, while the strains in bank funding markets may also
inhibit the availability of credit to consumers and
businesses,” the bank said in a statement.  “The deterioration in the outlook has made it more likely
that inflation will undershoot the 2 percent target in the
medium term,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
