Bulgaria  filed a 61 million-euro ($81
million) claim against Rosatom Corp. in a dispute over the
construction of a nuclear plant on the Danube.  The state-owned National Electricity Co. applied to an
arbitration court in Geneva to claw back the sum from Rosatom
for unpaid purchases of old equipment, the Sofia-based utility
said today in an e-mailed statement.  In July, Atomstroyexport ZAO, a unit of Rosatom,  Russia ’s
state-run nuclear company, said it had filed a 58 million-euro
claim against Bulgaria to the International Court of Arbitration
in Paris for delayed construction payments.  Atomstroyexport was hired in 2005 to build the plant for an
initial cost estimate of 4 billion euros. The project then
stalled because of a lack of funds and a dispute over new costs
caused by the delay. Rosatom gave a new cost estimate of 6.3
billion euros, while Bulgaria said the construction would cost
about 5 billion euros.  Last month, the two companies agreed to extend an accord to
March next year on the building of the proposed 2,000-megawatt
nuclear power plant, to give them time to complete a feasibility
study and consider ways of financing the project.  “We can’t take decisions to spend such huge amounts with
our eyes closed,” Energy and Economy Minister Traicho Traikov
said today in an interview with Bulgarian National Television in
Sofia. “We need to know the cost of investment, power market
development prospects, estimated electricity prices.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
