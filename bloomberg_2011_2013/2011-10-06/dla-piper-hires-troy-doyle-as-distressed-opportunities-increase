DLA Piper, the world’s third-highest
grossing  law firm , hired  Troy Doyle  from  Norton Rose  to head its
newly created restructuring and distressed investment team in
Asia amid  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “Given the volatility, we’re seeing an increase in
distressed investments across the region,” Doyle, who joined
Chicago-based DLA Piper this month, said in a phone interview
from Singapore today.  The number of companies considered distressed by Standard &
Poor’s in the U.S. increased “significantly” in September as
uncertainty about the European sovereign debt crisis rose and
disappointing economic data from the developed world weakened
investor sentiment.  “Having Troy on board to drive the team regionally allows
us to ramp up our capabilities to counsel clients in this key
area,” DLA Piper’s  Asia  managing partner, Lance Miller, said in
an e-mailed statement.  Lawyers from DLA Piper’s banking and corporate practices
used to advise clients before the firm set up its Asia
restructuring and debt investment group, Doyle, 37, said.  DLA Piper is the third-biggest law firm by revenue, with
$1.96 billion in its latest fiscal year,  according  to the
American Lawyer, a trade publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
