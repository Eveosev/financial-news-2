Latvia ’s gross domestic product will
expand at least 4 percent as the economy weathers the effect of
 Europe ’s debt crisis, said Mark Griffiths, the  International
Monetary Fund’s  mission chief for the Baltic country.  “The economic situation is getting better, GDP could grow
4 percent or even higher this year,” said Griffiths, at a press
conference in Riga today. “The difficulties in Europe will
effect Latvia but to a less extent” than previously in 2008, he
said.  Latvia’s economy grew 5.6 percent in the second quarter,
the quickest pace in 3 1/2 years, after contracting by almost a
quarter since 2008 following the end of credit-fueled real-
estate bubble. The government was forced to turn to a group led
by the European Commission and the IMF for a 7.5 billion-euro
($10 billion) loan in 2008 after the second-biggest bank needed
a state rescue.  The commission and IMF are in Latvia as part of a pre-
review mission to look at the budget and economic estimates, the
effect of a capital increase in airline AirBaltic AS and plans
to split state-owned Hipoteku Banka AS, Griffiths said.  Latvia’s mission with the EU and IMF ends in December. The
IMF forecast the country’s GDP growth at 4 percent this year and
3 percent next year in its European outlook released yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
