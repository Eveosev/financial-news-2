Peru’s sol headed for its biggest
two-day gain in four months as moves by the  European Central
Bank  to shore up the euro region’s money market spurred demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol strengthened 0.5 percent to 2.7485 per U.S. dollar
at 12:31 p.m. New York time, from 2.7630 yesterday. The currency
rose 0.5 percent yesterday.  The ECB will start buying covered bonds and offer banks two
additional unlimited loans, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
said today after policy makers left the benchmark interest rate
at 1.5 percent.  “Overseas investors are buying soles again as
international markets are calmer,” said  Mario Guerrero , an
economist at Scotiabank Peru in Lima. Peruvian banks may seek to
reduce their “heavy” dollar holdings as the sol strengthens,
Guerrero said.  Peru’s central bank will probably leave its benchmark rate
at 4.25 percent for a fifth month today, according to 17 of 18
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The bank will announce its
decision at about 7 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
