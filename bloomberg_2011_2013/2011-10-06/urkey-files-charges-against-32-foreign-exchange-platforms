Turkey ’s  market regulator  filed
charges against 32 web-based platforms that engage in foreign
exchange trading without the required permission.  The request for legal proceedings to be taken against the
companies was made to prosecutors, the  news agency  in Ankara
said. The move follows a probe into their activities, state-run
Anatolia news agency said.  Vedat Akgiray, Turkey’s chief market regulator, said on
Aug. 23 that investors may lose cash invested in foreign
exchange trading even after making a profit, because
unauthorized trading platforms may not pay up.  The regulator started receiving applications for licenses
to offer web-based  currency trading  as it sought to regulate the
industry, Akgiray told reporters on Sept. 13.  Turkey will limit web-based foreign exchange trading to
authorized brokers, Haberturk newspaper said on Aug. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
