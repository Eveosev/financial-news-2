Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King 
said the world economy has slowed down “substantially” in the
past few months.  “That’s affecting our ability to export, it’s affecting
our banks and affecting our recovery,” King said in a
television interview on  Sky News  today. “The impact from the
rest of the world does threaten the U.K.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
