Spain  will make lenders assume any
losses generated from the overhaul of the nation’s savings banks
through a decree law to shield public finances from the cost.  Spain’s industry-financed deposit guarantee funds will be
united into one entity that assumes the losses that may arise
when lenders seized by the state are sold. The funds have
combined equity of 6.59 billion euros ($8.75 billion), Finance
Minister  Elena Salgado  said today.  The measure will shield the  budget deficit  from any losses
as the Socialist government fights to rein in the euro region’s
third-largest shortfall. The changes will be passed by decree
while Parliament is closed just six weeks ahead of a general
election that polls show the ruling Socialists will lose.  “We’re doing it now because it’s now that we perceive the
possibility that the process could produce losses,” Salgado
said at a news conference in  Madrid  today.  Spain’s bank-rescue fund, the FROB, took over three more
lenders on Sept. 30 after they failed to meet a deadline to
bolster their capital in line with new requirements. The Bank of
Spain is also in the process of selling Caja de Ahorros del
Mediterraneo, which it seized in July, and Bank of Spain
Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said last week the
process may generate losses.  The changes will be passed by decree and can be ratified by
Parliament’s permanent committee, Salgado said. She has spoken
to the opposition  People’s Party  about the changes, the minister
said, without giving details on their view.  To contact the reporters on this story:
