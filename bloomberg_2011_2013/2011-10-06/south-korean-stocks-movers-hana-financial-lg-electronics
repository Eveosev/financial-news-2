Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in South Korea trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10:17 a.m. in Seoul. The  Kospi
Index (KOSPI)  rose 4 percent to 1,732.37 following a two-day, 5.8
percent retreat.  Mobile-phone makers: Samsung Electronics Co. (005930 KS),
the world’s second-largest maker of mobile phones, gained 4
percent to 876,000 won.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  (066570 KS), the
world’s third-largest, jumped 6.6 percent to 74,100 won. The
shares rose amid optimism they will gain market share after
Apple Inc.’s former Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs died.  “Even without Jobs as the CEO, people thought he would
have direct and indirect impact on management, and the company
would keep showing its ability to develop new devices,” Choi Do Yeon, an analyst at LIG Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul
said. “His death might weaken such ability. I cautiously think
it could be a chance for Korean companies to regain some of the
leadership they lost to Apple.”  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790)  (086790 KS), whose purchase of
 Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  from  Lone Star Funds  has been pending since
November on a legal dispute, rallied 7.8 percent to 36,100 won,
ahead of today’s court ruling. The Seoul High Court will rule on
a stock manipulation retrial case against Korea Exchange Bank,
Lone Star Funds and the U.S. firm’s former local unit head Paul
Yoo at 2 p.m. local time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
