He was an inventor with more than 300
patents to his name. He was a college dropout. He was a
billionaire who wore jeans to work.  He was one of the world’s great persuaders, coaxing
millions of people to try technology they had never considered
before. He was an angry perfectionist. He was the world’s best-
known corporate chief executive.  He was  Steve Jobs .  More than any other business leader of our time, Jobs
touched our souls. The computers, phones, music players, movies
and software that he and his colleagues devised at  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
weren’t just marvelous creations in their own right. They were
gateways to a future that held genuine promise.  Whether we were eager fans, lining up outside convention
halls to hear Jobs speak, or reluctant converts, muttering about
our children’s infatuations with iPods, we couldn’t help but be
swept up in the Apple founder’s vision. The tributes pouring in
after Jobs’s death Wednesday speak to this extraordinary gift.  Another aspect of Jobs’s time on earth, however, deserves a
moment’s reflection: the way he died. His pancreatic cancer was
diagnosed in 2003, when Jobs was 48. The last eight years of his
life were a series of health crises, partial recoveries and
dashed hopes. It would have been easy for him to turn bitter,
morose or self-destructive about his fate. Yet Jobs rose to new
career heights in those final years, while also gracing others
with as much compassion as they had ever seen. Although Apple
was at times criticized for being closed-mouthed about its
leader’s health, Jobs himself faced mortality earlier and more
bluntly than most.  ‘Life’s Change Agent’  “No one wants to die,” Jobs observed in a 2005
 commencement  speech at  Stanford University . Even so, he
declared, “Death is very likely the single best invention of
life. It’s life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make
way for the new.”  In his final years at Apple, Jobs spearheaded bold
expansions that stretched the company’s identity far beyond
computers. But he also did something that most founders can’t:
He gradually passed operating control of the company to one of
his long-time lieutenants,  Tim Cook . The notion of Apple without
Jobs -- which once must have seemed like a catastrophe to
customers, employees and investors -- is being absorbed with
sadness but also with calm. The lesson -- one that was
reinforced if you spent time with Jobs and could see a failing
body attached to a vibrant, powerful mind -- is that ideas live
on. Hardware gives out; software keeps running.  “Stay hungry, stay foolish,” Jobs declared at the end of
his 2005 Stanford talk. In reality, Jobs was hardly ever
foolish, though he didn’t mind if other people thought he was.
But he remained hungry and in pursuit -- of seismic ideas,
seamless execution and excellence in all its forms.  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:
