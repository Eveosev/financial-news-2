Ethanol futures gained in  Chicago  as
gasoline prices jumped for the second straight day and supplies
of the biofuel in New York Harbor were tight.  Futures have gained 1.4 percent since an Energy Department
report yesterday showed production of conventional gasoline
blended with ethanol rose 2 percent in the week ending Sept. 30,
the most since June 10, to 5.16 million barrels a day, while
gasoline stockpiles declined.  “It’s definitely a fundamental rally here,” Justin Dirico, senior ethanol trader at SCB & Associates LLC in
Chicago, said by telephone. “We’re still a little short in New
York Harbor area for material and product, which has caused the
spread from New York to Chicago to widen and continue to be
well-bid.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 0.22 cent, or
0.9 percent, to settle at $2.492 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the contract’s fourth straight gain.  In cash-market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 1.5
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.775 a gallon, and on the West Coast
the biofuel added 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.705,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 9.5 cents, or 3.7 percent,
to $2.66 a gallon, and in Chicago the additive climbed 7.5
cents, or 3 percent, to $2.575, Bloomberg data show.  Gasoline for November delivery soared 11.68 cents, or 4.5
percent, to settle at $2.686 a gallon in New York. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
