Telemar Norte Leste SA (TMAR5) , Brazil’s
biggest telecommunications operator by revenue, is close to
obtaining a $1 billion syndicated standby revolving-credit line,
according to three people familiar with the matter.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company will pay 90 basis points to
120 basis points over the London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, for the loan that has a maturity of five years, according
to the people who asked not to be identified because the
transaction isn’t public. The leaders are Bank of America Corp.,
Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group PLC, said the people.  Telemar originally wanted to obtain $1.5 billion and reduced
the amount to $1 billion because international loan markets have
deteriorated and the company didn’t want to pay a higher
 interest rate , according to the people. Telemar declined to
comment.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
