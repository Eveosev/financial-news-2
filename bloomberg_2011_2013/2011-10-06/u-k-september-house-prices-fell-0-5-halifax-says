U.K. house prices fell for a second
month in September as a darkening economic outlook and a squeeze
on household incomes curbed demand for homes, Halifax said.  Prices dropped 0.5 percent from August, the mortgage unit
of  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  said in a statement in  London  today.
From a year earlier, prices fell 0.7 percent to an average
161,132 pounds ($248,731).  The  Bank of England  is forecast to keep the benchmark rate
at a record low today after the economy grew less than
previously estimated in the second quarter while the crisis in
the euro area clouds recovery prospects. Consumer spending fell
the most in more than two years in the period as incomes were
eroded by higher inflation and government budget cuts.  “Greater uncertainty about economic and personal financial
circumstances, together with pressure on householders’ finances
from weak earnings growth, higher inflation and increases in
taxes, are likely to be constraining housing demand,” Halifax
economist  Martin Ellis  said in the statement. “We expect little
change over the remainder of this year.”  Gross domestic product rose 0.1 percent in the second
quarter from the first instead of the 0.2 percent previously
published, government data yesterday showed.  Consumer spending 
plunged 0.8 percent.  In the three months through September, home values rose 0.1
percent, the first quarterly increase since the period through
March 2010, Halifax said. They were down 2.3 percent from a year
earlier.  The central bank is also forecast to keep its bond-purchase
plan unchanged at 200 billion pounds, according to the median
forecast of 32 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Eleven
predicted an expansion in the plan.
