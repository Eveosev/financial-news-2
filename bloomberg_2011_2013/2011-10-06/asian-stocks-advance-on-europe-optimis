Asian stocks rose for the first time
in five days as better-than-expected U.S. economic data and
optimism European leaders will contain the region’s debt crisis
boosted the earnings outlook for exporters.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
advanced 4.7 percent in Tokyo.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) ,
Asia’s largest international carrier, jumped 6.9 percent in  Hong
Kong .  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building-materials supplier
that gets almost 70 percent of its sales from the U.S., climbed
8.2 percent in Sydney.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the No. 1 global
mining company, gained 3.3 percent as commodity prices advanced.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 3.2 percent to 110.76 as
of 6:38 p.m. in Tokyo. About eight stocks advanced for each
decliner and all 10 industry groups climbed, led by commodity
producers and banks. The gauge tumbled 16 percent in the third
quarter, the biggest drop since 2008, amid concern that  Europe ’s
debt crisis and a U.S. economic slowdown will drag the world
back into recession.  “The market is a bit more optimistic about prospects for
European policy makers to find a solution, particularly with the
solvency of European banks,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps
manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
Melbourne. The latest U.S. data is “a good sign” that the
economy is stabilizing, he said.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 1.7 percent. South

increase since December 2008.  U.S. Reports  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.6
percent today, erasing losses of as much as 0.4 percent. The  S&P
500  climbed 1.8 percent yesterday in  New York , increasing for a
second day, after a report showed U.S. companies added 91,000
jobs in September. Stocks also rose after the Institute for
Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index fell less than
forecast. Nasdaq-100 Index futures rebounded to rise 0.1 percent
after falling when Apple Inc. said co-founder  Steve Jobs  died
today. He was 56.  “The market sentiment is too pessimistic about the  U.S.
economy , which hasn’t become that bad,” said  Mitsushige Akino ,
who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “We can expect a rebound of stocks.”  The  International Monetary Fund  said European Union
officials are working on plans to boost bank capital. France and
Belgium said a “bad bank” will be set up to hold Dexia SA’s
troubled assets.  Last Resort  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe’s rescue fund
will only be used as a last resort to save banks and that
investors may have to take deeper losses as part of a Greek
rescue.  HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest lender by market value,
gained 4.7 percent to HK$59.30 in Hong Kong, while  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the nation’s largest lender to businesses,

won in Seoul and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  surged 6.3 percent to
73,900 won on optimism South Korea’s two largest electronics
makers will gain market share against Apple.  Commodity Shares  Asian commodity stocks also rallied. BHP Billiton gained
3.3 percent to A$36.30 in Sydney and rival Rio Tinto Group
climbed 4.9 percent to A$63.28. Korea Zinc Co., which produces
metals including zinc, lead and gold, jumped 6 percent to
246,000 won in Seoul.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s largest offshore
energy explorer, surged 8.5 percent to HK$12.30.  Crude oil for November delivery gained 5.3 percent on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday after the U.S. government
reported an unexpected decline in stockpiles in the world’s
biggest crude-consuming country. Oil gained as much as 1.8
percent today. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials advanced 1.9 percent yesterday, while New York-traded
