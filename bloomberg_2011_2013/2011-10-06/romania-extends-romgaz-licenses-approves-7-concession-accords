Romania â€™s government approved a five-
year extension for exploration licenses for eight blocks of
natural-gas producer Romgaz SA, which committed to invest at
least $520 million in the eastern European country.  The government also approved seven oil and gas concession
agreements with companies, including Ireland-based Moesia Oil
and Gas Plc and Blackstairs Energy, the Bucharest-based
 administration  said late yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The
production licenses had been previously held by Romgaz and oil
company  OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , which gave them up because the block
resources are depleting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
