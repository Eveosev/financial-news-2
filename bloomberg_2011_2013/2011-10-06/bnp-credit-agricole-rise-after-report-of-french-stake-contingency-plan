     Oct. 6 (Bloomberg) --  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
and  Natixis (KN)  SA rose in Paris trading after Le Figaro said the
French government is working on a contingency plan to take
stakes in the country’s lenders.  A French government official, who declined to be identified
because he’s not authorized to speak to the press, rejected the
report, calling it false.  Credit Agricole climbed 5.6 percent to 5.45 euros as of
9:44 a.m. in Paris, while BNP advanced 5.7 percent. Shares of
Natixis, the investment-banking unit of France’s second-largest
bank by branches, advanced 8.5 percent to 2.50 euros, the
biggest percentage gain in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The country’s state holding agency is working on the plan,
which would involve two or three unnamed banks, the newspaper
said, citing a person familiar with the matter that it didn’t
identify. Le Figaro added that the country’s economy ministry
denied that any refinancing of banks was being considered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
