German two-year notes rose after the
 Bank of England  expanded its bond-purchase program for the first
time in almost two years.  The advance pushed the yield down three basis points to
0.47 percent as of 12:06 p.m. in London. Ten-year bunds pared an
earlier decline, leaving the yield two basis points higher at
1.86 percent.  Euribor futures rose, pushing the implied yield on the
December contract down six basis points to 1.19 percent.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee led by  Mervyn King  raised the ceiling for so-called quantitative easing to 275
billion pounds from 200 billion pounds. Twenty one of 32
economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast no change, and
the rest predicted increases ranging from 50 billion pounds to
100 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
