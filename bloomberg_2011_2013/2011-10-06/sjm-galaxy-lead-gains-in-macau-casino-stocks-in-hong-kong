SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) ,  Asia ’s biggest
casino operator, and  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  led gains in Hong Kong-
listed gambling stocks on speculation the plunge earlier this
week went too far given growth prospects.  SJM climbed as much as 23 percent, the biggest intraday
gain in almost three years, to HK$13.14 before closing at
HK$12.44 at 4 p.m. Sands  China , controlled by billionaire
 Sheldon Adelson , surged a record 26 percent to HK$18.98.  Today’s gains pared losses from earlier this week, when
Macau casinos plunged amid concern slowing growth in China and
slumping stock markets may damp demand. Gambling revenue in the
former Portuguese colony grew 39 percent last month, data
published Oct. 4 by the city’s government showed.  “The casinos are still quite resilient as shown by gaming
revenue in September,” Teng Yee Tan, an analyst at CIMB
Securities HK Ltd., said in an e-mail reply to Bloomberg News
today. “The market is expecting positive surprises to happen
every month, but that’s not realistic. Growth normalization will
come at some point in time.”  Both Wynn Macau Ltd. and MGM China Holdings Ltd. jumped 20
percent.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  rose 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
