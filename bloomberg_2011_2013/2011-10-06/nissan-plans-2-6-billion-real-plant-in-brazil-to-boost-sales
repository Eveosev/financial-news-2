Nissan Motor Co. is investing 2.6
billion reais ($1.4 billion) to build an auto-assembly plant
near Rio de Janeiro as the carmaker boosts sales in Brazil’s
fast-growing market and shifts output from  Japan .  The factory in Resende, 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of
Rio, will be able to produce 200,000 cars and utility vehicles
based on the company’s compact “V” platform, Chief Executive
Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said at an event in Rio today. It will
employ 2,000 workers and open in 2014, according to Yokohama-
based Nissan, which said it intended to build the plant in June.  “Brazil has a level of motorization that is way below its
potential,” Ghosn said today in an interview in Rio. The sales
“trend over the long term, there’s no doubt in my mind, it’s
going to be up. An average of 5 percent increase a year is
totally reasonable for  Brazil .”  The country’s vehicle sales have risen at least 10 percent
each of the past five years, and the market is now the world’s
fifth-biggest by volume. The country raised taxes last month on
certain vehicles with less than 65 percent of parts and
materials made in the country, the Mercosur free-trade area or
Mexico, to limit imports of low-cost vehicles.  “Brazil is going to be Renault’s second-biggest market in
the world by the end of this year,” Ghosn, chief executive of
both Nissan and  Renault SA (RNO) , said at a press conference in
Brasilia on Oct. 1 after talks with President Dilma Rousseff.
Ghosn was born in the state of  Rio de Janeiro .  The Yen’s Effect  Japanese carmakers are also under pressure to shift vehicle
production abroad as the yen strengthens, eroding earnings from
vehicles shipped overseas. Toshiyuki Shiga, Nissan’s chief
operating officer, said Oct. 4 the strong currency is a “very
severe” situation for the company.  Nissan’s market share in Brazil is 1.7 percent, more than
double the level a year ago, and the company said it aims to
raise it to at least 5 percent by 2016.  “We are building this plant with a larger infrastructure
than the 200,000 cars,” Ghosn said in an interview. “The
200,000 cars are only a first step into what should be a much
bigger plant in the future.”  Renault ranked fifth in Brazil vehicle sales in September
and Nissan 10th, according to the National Vehicle
Manufacturer’s Association in Sao Paulo.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Fiat
SpA (F) ,  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F)  ranked ahead of
Renault.  Renault, based in Boulogne-Billancourt, France, said
yesterday it plans a 212 million-euro ($283 million) expansion
of the Curitiba factory and aims to add 13 new models in Brazil
between 2012 and 2016.  Separately, Volkswagen said Oct. 4 it will spend 3.4
billion euros in Brazil through 2016 as part of a five-year
investment plan announced in September.  Nissan rose 28 yen, or 4.3 percent, to 686 yen today in
Tokyo Stock Exchange trading. Renault rose 1.77 euros, or 7.5
percent, to 25.495 euros today in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
