David Freese drove in four runs with
a two-run homer and a two-run double and the  St. Louis Cardinals 
forced a decisive Game 5 in their National League Division
Series against the Philadelphia Phillies.  The Cardinals’ 5-3 win today at Busch Stadium in  St. Louis 
means the best-of-five Major League Baseball series will come 
down to a game Oct. 7 in Philadelphia.  In the other NL first-round series, the Milwaukee Brewers
take a 2-1 lead into Game 4 tonight at the Arizona Diamondbacks.  In the American League, the Texas Rangers won their series
3-1 against the Tampa Bay Rays and await the winner of tomorrow
night’s decisive Game 5 in New York between the Yankees and the
Detroit Tigers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
