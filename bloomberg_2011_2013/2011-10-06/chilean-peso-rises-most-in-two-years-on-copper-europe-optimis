Chile ’s peso gained the most since
May 2009, leading advances among major emerging-market
currencies, as copper prices surged on optimism European policy
makers will contain the region’s debt crisis.  The peso rose 2.1 percent to 520.1 per  U.S. dollar  from
530.75 yesterday. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American Currency
Index gained 1 percent, rising for the first time in five days.  The price of copper, which accounts for more than half of
Chile’s exports, rose the most in more than a week on
speculation  Europe  will increase support for banks. Copper for
December delivery climbed as much as 5.3 percent on the Comex in
 New York , boosting Chile’s trade prospects.  “We expect the peso to start appreciating again, basically
because of external factors,” said  Osvaldo Cruz , an economist
at Banco de Credito & Inversiones in Santiago. “Some of the
losses in the peso from recent days will revert in part because
of measures from the  European central bank .”  The European Central Bank said today it would resume buying
covered bonds and offer banks unlimited loans for 12 and 13
months.  Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
increased their net bet on the dollar to $6.1 billion on Oct. 4
from $5.3 billion on Sept. 30 and $385 million at the end of
August, according to central bank data.  Chile’s central bank sold $38 million of 10-year bonds
denominated in pesos at a yield of 4.97 percent, the first time
it has paid less than 5 percent since at least July 2004.  Even so, the yield difference between baskets of five-year
and 10-year central bank bonds in pesos increased to 50 basis
points, the most since Jan. 5.  The bank also sold $84 million of inflation-linked 10-year
bonds at a yield of 2.24 percent, the lowest since February
2009. The inflation-linked bond sale had been rescheduled after
an auction on Sept. 20 was declared void.  Demand for the inflation-linked bonds totaled more than
twice the amount offered, while demand for the fixed-rate bonds
was more than three times the amount offered.  Banks bought 45 percent of the fixed-rate peso bonds and 20
percent of the inflation-linked bonds, the central bank said.
Pension funds and others took the rest.  The one-year interest-rate swap rate rose for a second day,
climbing 11 basis points to 4.23 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
