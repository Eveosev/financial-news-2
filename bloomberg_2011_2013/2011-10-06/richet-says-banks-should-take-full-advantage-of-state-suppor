European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet said banks should take full advantage of state
support.  “Where necessary, they should take full advantage of
government support measures, which should be made totally
operational, including the possibility in future for the
European Financial Stability Facility to lend to governments in
order to recapitalise banks,” Trichet said at a press
conference in Berlin today.   To contact the reporter on this story:
