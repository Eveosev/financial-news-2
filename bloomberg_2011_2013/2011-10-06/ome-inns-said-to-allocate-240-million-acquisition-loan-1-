Home Inns & Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN) ,
which runs budget hotels in China, allocated a $240 million
five-year acquisition loan among eight banks, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the
arrangers of the loan, committed $40 million each, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the details are
private. Natixis committed $35 million. BNP Paribas SA,
Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Credit Agricole CIB and Shinhan Asia
Ltd. pledged $30 million each. Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Asia Ltd. loaned $5 million.  The loan pays a margin of 375 basis points over the London
interbank offered rate, the person said. The facility pays a so-
called all-in rate, which includes fees, of about 450 basis
points, a second person familiar with the matter said in
September.  The loan is for Home Inns’ acquisition of budget hotel
chain operator Motel 168. Home Inns agreed to buy Motel 168 in
May for $470 million in cash, debt and shares. The deal “will
create the most geographically diverse economy hotel operation
in  China ,” Home Inns said in a May 27 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
