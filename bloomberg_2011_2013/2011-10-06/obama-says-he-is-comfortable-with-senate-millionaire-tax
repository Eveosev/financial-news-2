President  Barack Obama  said he’s
“comfortable” with a proposal by Senate Democrats to impose a
surtax on people making at least $1 million a year to pay for
his jobs plan.  The administration is “open to a variety of ways to pay
for” the $447 billion package of tax cuts and spending aimed at
spurring hiring, Obama said at a White House news conference.
“I’m fine with the approach they’re taking.”  Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, said
yesterday that the 5 percent tax would generate $450 billion,
enough to cover the cost of the administration’s proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
