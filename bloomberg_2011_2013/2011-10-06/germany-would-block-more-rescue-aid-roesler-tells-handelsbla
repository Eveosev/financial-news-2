German lawmakers would not support
any attempt to further leverage the European rescue fund or its
permanent successor, the European Stability Mechanism, Economy
Minister Philipp Roesler was cited as saying in an interview
with Handelsblatt newspaper.  “Parliament would have to approve that,” Roesler was
cited as saying when asked if he is against any further increase
of the current rescue fund, the European Financial Stability
Facility, or its post-2013 successor, the ESM.  “I don’t see any majority for that in the Bundestag,” he
said. “Leveraging, for instance via a bank license for the
permanent crisis mechanism, the ESM, would exceed the agreed
liability risk of 211 billion euros.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
