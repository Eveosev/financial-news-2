U.K. gilts rallied after the  Bank of
England  unexpectedly expanded its bond purchase program to
stimulate the economy while leaving its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at a record low 0.5 percent.  The gains pushed down yields on 10-year gilts by nine basis
points to 2.27 percent as of 12:07 p.m. in London. Two-year note
yields sank six basis points to 0.52 percent.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee led by  Mervyn
King  raised the ceiling for so-called quantitative easing to 275
billion pounds from 200 billion pounds, the first increase in
the program since 2009. Twenty-one of 32 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey forecast no change, and the rest predicted
increases ranging from 50 billion pounds to 100 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
