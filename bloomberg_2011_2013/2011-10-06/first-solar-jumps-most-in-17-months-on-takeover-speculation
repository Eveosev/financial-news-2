First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest
thin-film solar panel maker, surged the most in 17 months on
market speculation it’s a takeover target.  First Solar climbed as much as 11 percent, the most since
April 29, 2010, and was 8.3 percent higher at $65.93 at 12:21
p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  “It seems I hear this rumor monthly,” Aaron Chew, an
analyst at Maxim Group LLC in New York, said by e-mail. “Though
I don’t ascribe too much validity to it, I admit it is certainly
more possible at these levels than it was when the stock was
north of $100.”  Alan Bernheimer , a spokesman for the Tempe, Arizona-based
company, said in an e-mail that the First Solar doesn’t comment
on market speculation.  First Solar has slumped 60 percent since reaching a high
for the year of $175.45 in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
