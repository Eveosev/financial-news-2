Ukraine’s grain harvest rose by 17
percent to 42 million metric tons as of yesterday compared with
a year earlier, agricultural researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Average grain yields increased to 3.26 tons a hectare (2.47
acres) from 2.66 tons, the Kiev-based researcher said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Winter grains have been planted on 5.7 million hectares,
which account for 69 percent of the targeted area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
