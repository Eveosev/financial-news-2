Asia  fuel oil  sank to the biggest
discount to crude in six days, signaling growing losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products. Gasoil’s crack
spread, a measure of processing profit, fell.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Asian marker Dubai crude widened 9
cents to $3.51 a barrel at 12:45 p.m.  Singapore  time, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s the largest gap
since Sept. 28, when a fire in Singapore prompted Royal Dutch
Shell Plc to shut its largest refinery globally and suspend some
fuel exports.  High-sulfur fuel oil swaps for November added $9.50, or 1.6
percent, to $610.50 a metric ton, PVM data showed. Prices
snapped a five-day losing streak. The premium of 180-centistoke
fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade was unchanged after decreasing
to $7.25. A narrower viscosity spread indicates bunker, or
marine fuel, has gained more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude fell 80
cents to $16.87 a barrel, according to PVM. This crack spread
was the narrowest since Sept. 28.  November gasoil swaps rose 75 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$114.30 a barrel, PVM said. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil climbed
10 cents to $2.60. This regrade has increased 53 percent so far
this week, meaning it is more profitable to make  aviation fuel 
over diesel.  Light Distillates  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
first-half November delivery were bid at $866.50 a ton against
offers at $869.90, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte, a
broker. This signals the petrochemical feedstock may advance
after closing at $856.75 yesterday.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures,
also known as the crack spread, was up $3.16 at $85.95 a ton,
based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday, it dropped to
the narrowest since Aug. 5.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday rallied to $23.40 a
barrel, the highest since May 6, Bloomberg data showed. A
widening reforming margin indicates motor fuel is more
profitable to produce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
