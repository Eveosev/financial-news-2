     Oct. 6 (Bloomberg) --  Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the seller of life insurance and property-casualty
coverage, said market slumps and declines in customer retirement
accounts cost the company about $500 million last quarter. The
stock fell in New York trading.  The sum includes about $110 million tied to the Japan
annuity business, according to a slide  presentation  today from
Hartford, which is based in the Connecticut city of the same
name. Hartford said its so-called core earnings were reduced by
about $230 million from the costs tied to retirement products.
Catastrophe claims cut core earnings by another $130 million.  Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee , hired in 2009, has
curtailed the sale of equity-based retirement accounts called
variable annuities to protect the company when markets decline.
Hartford halted new sales in  Japan  in 2009 while retaining
liabilities tied to annuities sold before the financial crisis.
When stocks fall, Hartford’s annuity liabilities may increase.  “While challenges exist, our risks are significantly
reduced and manageable,” the insurer said in the presentation.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 14 percent in the
three months ended Sept. 30, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock
Average slid 11 percent.  Hartford dropped 36 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $16.59 at
9:39 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest decline in the 24-company KBW Insurance Index. The
company has slumped about 38 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
