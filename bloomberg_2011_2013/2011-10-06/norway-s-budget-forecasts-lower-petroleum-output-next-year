Norway , the world’s seventh-largest
oil exporter that’s struggling to keep up output as fields
mature, forecast petroleum production will decline by 1.3
percent next year.  Output will slip to 226 million standard cubic meters of
oil equivalent from an estimated 229 million cubic meters this
year, the government said today in its 2012  national budget .  The country is basing its budget revenue on  oil prices 
averaging 588 kroner ($100.5) a barrel this year and 575 kroner
a barrel in 2012, according to the document. Gas prices are
estimated at 2.05 kroner per cubic meter in 2011 and 2.10 kroner
in 2012.  “There’s considerable uncertainty regarding gas prices
going forward,” the government said in the budget document.
“While strong growth is still expected from  China  and other
emerging markets, the forecasts for the U.S. and Europe have
been significantly revised down over the summer.”  Norway, which is also the world’s second-biggest gas
exporter, is facing dwindling production due to maturing fields.
Output peaked in 2000 and may drop 6 percent this year to about
1.7 million barrels a day, according to the  Norwegian Petroleum
Directorate . Recent oil discoveries made by  Statoil ASA (STL)  and
 Lundin Petroleum AB (LUPE) , including the Aldous-Avaldsnes find in the
 North Sea  that may be the country’s third-largest, have raised
the prospect of extending production.  Norway’s oil production, including natural-gas liquids and
condensate, is forecast at 120 million cubic meters of oil
equivalent this year, 115 million next year and 109 million in
2015, according to today’s budget bill. Gas output is forecast
to climb from 109 billion cubic meters in 2011 to 111 billion
next year and 112 billion in 2015.  ‘Strong Growth’  Petroleum investments are forecast to reach a record 172
billion kroner next year, from an estimated 152 billion kroner
in 2011, according to a quarterly survey published last month by
Norway’s statistics agency.  “It’s uncertain how much of the strong growth can be
attributed to prices and volume growth,” the government said.
“We anticipate the volume growth in the petroleum investments
to be 12.5 percent this year and 11 percent next year.”  The nation’s petroleum industry, which accounts for about a
quarter of the economy and has shielded the country from the
worst of the credit crisis, is forecast to contribute 341
billion kroner in net  cash flow  to the budget this year and 352
billion kroner in 2012, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
