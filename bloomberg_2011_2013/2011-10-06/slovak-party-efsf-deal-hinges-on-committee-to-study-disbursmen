Slovakia’s ruling-coalition party
Freedom and Solidarity has prepared a proposal that may allow
parliament to approve an overhaul of the euro-area’s bailout
mechanism, said Daniel Krajcer, a party deputy chairman.  The plan will be presented today at a coalition meeting,
Krajcer, who is also Minister of Culture, told reporters today
in the capital Bratislava, without elaborating.  The plan would create a special committee in Slovakia that
would decide on any disbursement of funds from the European
Financial Stability Facility, Most party official Bela Bugar
told reporters today.  SaS, as the party is known, will back the motion in a
parliamentary vote on Oct. 11 if its condition is met, Sme
newspaper reported today, citing Jozef Kollar, the head of
SaS’s parliamentary caucus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
