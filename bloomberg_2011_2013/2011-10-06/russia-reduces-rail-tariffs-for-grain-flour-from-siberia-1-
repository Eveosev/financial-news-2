Russia’s Federal Service on Tariffs
reduced charges on the transportation of grain and flour exports
from the Siberian federal district and Kurgan region, the
service said.  The tariffs will be cut by half for distances that exceed
1,100 kilometers (684 miles), the service said today on its
website, without providing cash amounts. The reduction will run
through June 30 next year for shipments to ports and railway
stations on the borders with  North Korea ,  China  and Mongolia,
the service said. The new rate will apply through Dec. 31 for
shipments to the border with Ukraine, it said.  The same reduction will apply to shipments of soybeans and
soybean oil meal from the Far Eastern federal district to all
destinations through June 30, the service added.  Russia’s government was looking at lowering the cost of
hauling grain by rail to help farmers in the country’s interior
sell their crops, Sergei Sukhov, the  Agriculture Ministry ’s
deputy head of agriculture market regulation, said in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
