Tropical Storm Philippe is nearing
hurricane status in the Atlantic southeast of  Bermuda  though it
poses no threat to land, the National Hurricane Center said.  The storm, about 455 miles (735 kilometers) from Bermuda,
is moving north-northeast at 8 miles per hour with 70 mph winds,
the Miami-based center said in a 5 a.m. East coast time
 advisory . A storm becomes a hurricane when winds reach 74 mph.  Philippe is expected to become a hurricane later today
before “slow weakening starts” tomorrow, the NHC said. Its
forecast path shows the storm may be a hurricane for two to
three days, then dissipate over cooler North Atlantic waters.  In the Pacific off  Mexico ’s west coast, a tropical
depression formed with 35 mph winds that’s about 885 miles
south-southwest of  Baja California . The system may become a
tropical storm later today or tomorrow, the NHC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
