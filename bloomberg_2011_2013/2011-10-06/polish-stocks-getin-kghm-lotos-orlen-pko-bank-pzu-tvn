Poland ’s WIG20 Index advanced for a
second day, adding 32.34, or 1.5 percent, to 2,177.21 at 1:44
p.m. in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, rose
0.52 zloty, or 1.6 percent, to 32.81 zloty, its second day of
gains. PZU SA (PZU PW), the country’s largest insurer, climbed 4
zloty, or 1.3 percent, to 304 zloty.  Getin Holding SA (GTN)  ,
the financial-services group controlled by billionaire Leszek
Czarnecki, rose 0.19 zloty, or 2.6 percent, to 7.49 zloty.  Financial shares extended gains in Europe on continuing
speculation that  Europe ’s leaders will reach an agreement to
contain the sovereign-debt crisis.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, jumped 5 zloty, or 4.1 percent, to
126.4 zloty, extending yesterday’s 3.3 percent increase. Copper
advanced as better-than-expected U.S. economic data and
speculation that Europe will contain the region’s debt crisis
boosted demand for industrial metals.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, gained
0.09 zloty, or 0.3 percent, to 35.64 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) 
, the second-largest refiner, climbed 0.11 zloty, or 0.5
percent, to 23.11 zloty. Oil rose as investors bet that
shrinking crude stockpiles and signs of economic recovery
indicate more demand for fuel.  TVN SA (TVN)   rose 0.22 zloty, or 1.5 percent, to 15.4
zloty, heading for the highest close in two months. ITI Holdings
SA will next week pick one bidder to hold exclusive talks on the
sale of its majority stake in Poland’s largest television
network,  Gazeta Wyborcza  reported, citing three unidentified
people. Vivendi SA and Time Warner Inc. are bidding to buy TVN
after RTL Group SA withdrew, the Warsaw-based newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
