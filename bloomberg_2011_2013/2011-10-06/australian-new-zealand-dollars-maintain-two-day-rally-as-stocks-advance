The Australian and New Zealand
dollars rose for a third day versus the U.S. currency as global
stocks rallied, increasing demand for higher-yielding assets.  Both South Pacific currencies were supported after the
 European Central Bank  said it will reintroduce loans to banks in
an effort to buoy crisis-ridden markets. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rose for a third day and commodities advanced.  “The crazy jigsaw that is the European debt debacle is
starting to see a plan bubbling around in the background and
that should be positive for risk,” said  Chris Weston , an
institutional dealer at IG Markets in Melbourne.  Australia’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to 96.97 U.S. cents at
11:36 a.m. in New York, from 96.59 yesterday, when it rose 0.9
percent. The currency fetched 74.25 yen from 74.17. New
Zealand’s dollar added 0.2 percent to 76.78 U.S. cents after
advancing 0.8 percent to 76.62 yesterday. It rose 0.1 percent to
58.82 yen.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  index of stocks rose 1.8 percent and the  S&P
500 Index (SPX)  climbed 0.8 percent. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of raw materials advanced 0.9 percent.  ECB officials left their benchmark rate at 1.5 percent, as
predicted by 41 of 52 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the ECB will resume covered-
bond purchases and reintroduce year-long loans for banks as the
sovereign-debt crisis threatens to freeze money markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
