ITI Holdings SA will next week pick
one bidder to hold exclusive talks to buy  TVN SA (TVN) , Poland’s
largest television network, Gazeta Wyborcza reported, citing
three unidentified people.  Vivendi SA (VIV)  and  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  are bidding to buy TVN
after RTL Group SA withdrew, the Warsaw-based newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information. Vivendi’s
bid is higher, Gazeta said, citing a person it didn’t name.  The newspaper didn’t give the level of the offers.  Oliver Fahlbusch, a spokesman for RTL, declined to comment
on the possible withdrawal, Wyborcza said. Wojciech Kostrzewa,
the chief executive officer of ITI, said the company hasn’t
picked a “preferred” bidder yet.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
