Brazil ’s  Agriculture Ministry  doesn’t
expect food prices to fall as much during the 2012 harvest as in
previous years, said Deputy Minister Jose Carlos Vaz.  The smaller price drop during the harvest won’t help ease
inflation as much as in the past, Vaz said today at a press
conference in Brasilia. Usually, rising food supplies during the
harvest drive down costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
