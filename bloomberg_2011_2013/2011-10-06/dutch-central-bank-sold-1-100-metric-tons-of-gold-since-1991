The Dutch central bank has sold 1,100
metric tons of gold since 1991 to bring its reserves in line
with that of other important gold-owning nations, Finance
Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  said.  The Dutch central bank stopped lending out gold in 2008, De
Jager wrote today in response to  questions  from a lawmaker.
Former Dutch central bank governor Nout Wellink in March said
the bank holds 612 metric tons of gold and has no plans to sell.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
