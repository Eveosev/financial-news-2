Mochron Ltd., a South African
commodities trader, plans a public share sale within three
years, Chief Executive Officer Julius Steyn said.  “The decision on where to list” has yet to be taken by
Mochron’s board, Steyn told reporters in  Cape Town  today. The
initial public offering “will most likely involve a main
listing, with secondary listings in several other countries.”  Mochron is controlled by 64 shareholders in 20 countries.
It owns the World Trade Center  Africa  Initiative, an affiliate
of the  World Trade Centers Association  network, whose members
operate more than 330 business centers in almost 100 countries.  The grouping aims to facilitate trade for small and medium-
sized companies in the mining, energy, manufacturing and
agriculture industries in sub-Saharan Africa, and earns fees on
successful transactions, Steyn said.  Land worth more than $30 million has been acquired in
 Rwanda , Burundi, Tanzania, Namibia and the  Democratic Republic 
of Congo that will be used to construct new World Trade Centers,
Theo Poggenpoel, the initiative’s vice president for African
relations, told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
