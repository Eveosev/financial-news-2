Thailand â€™s seasonal floods may cause
as much as 130 billion baht of damage and reduce economic growth
by up to 1.3 percentage points, the University of the Thai
Chamber of Commerce said today.  The new estimate includes the cost of flooding in southern
Thailand in April and May, in addition to damage caused by a
deluge that began in July, the university said in a statement.  The university cut its economic growth forecast for this
year to 3.6 percent from a May estimate of 4.4 percent because
of the floods and the faltering global recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
