Canadian natural gas fell as a U.S.
government report showed stockpiles increased more than average
last week, weakening demand for the power-plant fuel.  Prices declined 1.1 percent after the Energy Department
said gas stockpiles rose 97 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Sept. 30 to 3.409 trillion cubic feet. The five-year average
change for the week is an increase of 74 billion, department
data show. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an
expected gain of 98 billion.  Alberta  gas for November delivery fell 3.75 cents to C$3.24
per gigajoule ($2.95 per million Btu) as of 3:05 p.m. New York
time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet market. December gas
dropped 5.5 cents to C$3.485. Gas traded on the exchange is
shipped to users in  Canada  and the U.S. and is priced on
TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  “When you step back, it was still 97 bcf put into storage
when typically we put in about 70 to 75 bcf at this time of
year,”  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst in Houston at Canaccord
Genuity, said in a telephone interview. “There’re still very
robust injections and that’s a reflection of what continues to
be an oversupply condition in this market.”  Gas for November delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 2.8 cents to settle at $3.598 per million Btu.  Gas Prices   Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
dropped 24.49 cents, or 6.6 percent, to $3.4456 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line
that can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest
from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 14.73 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $3.298,
according to ICE.  At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, gas declined 16.01 cents, or 4.5 percent, to
$3.3874 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 834 million above the target, as of 3 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.6 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  Gas Flows  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.93 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 583 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.51 billion cubic feet today, about 72 percent of its
capacity of 2.09 billion.  Volume on  Spectra Energy ’s system, which gathers the fuel
in northeastern British Columbia for delivery to Vancouver and
the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.79 billion cubic feet at 2:05
p.m.  Spectra reported low linepack conditions on the Mainline
North of the British Columbia system. Shippers were asked to
lower accounts toward zero over the next few days because of an
Alberta East capacity constraint on Oct. 11, the company said on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
