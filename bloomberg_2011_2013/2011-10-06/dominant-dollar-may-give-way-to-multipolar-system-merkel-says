The dollar’s dominance may give way
to a “multipolar” currency system as power shifts in the world
economy, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said.  “We all know that the international currency system is a
system in transition, that it will probably move in the future
from a currency system that’s very strongly concentrated in one
currency, that is the dollar, to a multipolar currency system,”
Merkel said in Berlin today after talks on global currencies
with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine
Lagarde, World Bank President  Robert Zoellick  and Angel Gurria,
the head of of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.  The future of the global monetary system, including
monitoring of capital flows, will form part of the discussion at
next month’s Group of 20 summit in Cannes, France, she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
