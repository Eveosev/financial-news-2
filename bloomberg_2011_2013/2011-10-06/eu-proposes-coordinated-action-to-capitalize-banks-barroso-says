The European Commission has proposed
coordinated action to recapitalize the region’s banks, President
 Jose Barroso  said.  “We are now proposing to the member states to have a
coordinated action to recapitalize banks and so to get rid of
toxic assets that they may have,” Barroso said today in a
question-and-answer session broadcast on  YouTube World View .  Barroso said governments have provided “at least 500
billion euros directly to support the banks” since 2008. “If
you count with the guarantees, it’s more than 1 trillion euros.
And if you add all the measures taken to help the real economy,
it’s more than 4 trillion euros, so it’s really a huge amount of
money,” he said.  Those funds come ultimately “from the taxpayers,” Barroso
said, so “it’s only fair now to ask the banking sector to give
a contribution back to society.” He said he will push for a
global financial-transactions tax at the Group of 20 nations.  Preventing business from going to other regions “is the
reason to have it a global tax,” Barroso said. “That’s why at
the G-20 we are going to push for having a global tax, but if
there is no agreement to have it at a global level, at least
someone has to start and why not start it here in  Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
