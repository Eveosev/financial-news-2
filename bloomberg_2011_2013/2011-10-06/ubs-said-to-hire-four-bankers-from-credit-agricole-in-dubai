UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
is hiring four bankers from  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ’s investment
banking unit for its corporate advisory group in Dubai, two
people familiar with the matter said.  UBS is recruiting Kanhaiya Rathi, Kawtar Benkhraba, Pravin Chelluri and Rami Barazi from Credit Agricole, France’s third-
largest bank by market value, one of the people said. A
secretary from Credit Agricole will also join UBS, the person
said.  The bankers will report to Albert Momdjian, previously head
of Credit Agricole’s investment banking for the  Middle East  and
North Africa, one of the people said. Momdjian joined UBS in
August as head of its ultra-high net-worth business and head of
corporate advisory group for the MENA region.  A UBS spokeswoman, declining to be identified because of
company policy, confirmed the moves. A spokesperson for  Credit
Agricole  wasn’t immediately available to comment.  Credit Agricole CIB, the bank’s corporate-and investment-
unit said Sept. 27 that it will guide Gulf-region clients on
mergers and acquisitions from Paris because it doesn’t plan to
keep an advisory team in the area.  Reuters yesterday reported UBS had hired five investment
bankers from Credit Agricole, without giving further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
