The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development is considering a loan of as much as 30 million
euros ($40 million) to ProCredit Bank Serbia to finance small
business clients in the Balkan country, the lender said in a
statement.  The aim of the transaction is to increase medium-term
funding available for Serbian small- and medium-sized
businesses, “who are the main source of private sector
employment and major contributors to the country’s economy,”
the EBRD said, citing ProCredit Bank’s “outreach to rural
areas” as valuable in providing funding to small regional
businesses.  ProCredit Bank Serbia is a mid-sized bank, owned by
ProCredit Holding AG and Commerzbank, with a 2.4 percent market
share. The EBRD will discuss the loan on Nov. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
