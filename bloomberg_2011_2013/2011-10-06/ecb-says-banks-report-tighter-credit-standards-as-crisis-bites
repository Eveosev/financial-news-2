The  European Central Bank  said
financial institutions tightened credit standards
“significantly” in the third quarter and expect to tighten
them further in the fourth.  “The increase in the net tightening of credit standards
reported for the third quarter of 2011 should be seen against
the background of a re-intensification of the sovereign debt
crisis that undermined the perceived soundness of euro-area
banks,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said today, citing its
quarterly Bank Lending Survey.  The ECB also said company demand for loans declined in the
third quarter for the first time in more than a year and banks
expect it to drop further in the fourth quarter.  “This decline points to a significant contraction of loan
demand from the corporate sector over the summer period,
possibly driven by increasing overall uncertainty and a
moderation in the pace of economic activity, notably
investment,” the ECB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
