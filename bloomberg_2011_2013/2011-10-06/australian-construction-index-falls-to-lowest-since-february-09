A gauge of  Australia ’s building
industry showed the weakest reading since February 2009 as new
orders sank to a record low.  The construction performance index dropped 2.1 points to 30
in September, according to a survey by the Australian Industry
Group and the Housing Industry Association released in Sydney
today. The result was the 16th consecutive month under 50, the
dividing line between expansion and contraction.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia this week left its benchmark
interest rate unchanged at 4.75 percent, citing a “softer”
labor market and consumers who are “more concerned about the
possibility of unemployment rising.” The RBA signaled less
concern about wage pressure from a mining investment boom and
said there’s more scope to cut rates if necessary.  “The construction sector continues to struggle in the face
of subdued demand and low levels of investor and consumer
confidence,” said Peter Burn, director of public policy at the
Australian Industry Group. “Lower  interest rates  would assist
in reigniting demand for housing and commercial construction.”  New orders slid 0.6 point to 23.9, the lowest level since
the series began in 2005, and a gauge of employment fell 2.6
points to 32.3 last month, the report showed. Construction of
houses plunged 5.5 points to 24.1 and apartments dropped 4.2
points to 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
