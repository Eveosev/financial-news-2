EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest
discount carrier, plans to open two new bases in  France  next
year, strengthening its challenge to the nation’s flagship
carrier  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group.  EasyJet will base two Airbus SAS A319 narrowbody airplanes
in both Nice and Toulouse for next year’s summer season, taking
the size of its fleet in France to 24 airplanes, it said in a
statement today.  The company estimates the penetration of low-cost carriers
in the French market to be 24 percent, about half the European
average, giving it room to expand. Air France, under pressure in
its home market, is rolling out its own lower-cost regional
operations.  “France is a strategic market for EasyJet, where the
airline -- already the country’s second-largest -- clearly has
room to grow,” Catherine Lynn, the airline’s customer and
revenue director, said in the statement.  EasyJet opened its first French base at Paris Orly in 2003
and added bases at the city’s  Charles de Gaulle  airport and Lyon
in 2008. The airline said it has flown 12 million passengers to
and from France this year.  As a consequence of the new bases, the carrier will add
five additional routes from Toulouse, including Basel and
Brussels, and a further five destinations from Nice, including
Bordeaux and Nantes.  The move will lift the number of routes it flies to from
the two airports by 10 to 37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
