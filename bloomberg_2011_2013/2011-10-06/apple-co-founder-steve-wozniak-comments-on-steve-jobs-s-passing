Steve Wozniak, co-founder of  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) , comments about  Steve Jobs , in an interview with Bloomberg
Television.  Apple issued a statement saying Jobs died Oct. 5. He
stepped down as chief executive officer of the Cupertino,
Calif.-based company in August after combating a rare form of
cancer.  “He was one of those cool guys. He knew technology, he
understood it. We talked about the philosophies of the day, the
hippy movement, words in songs and went to concerts together. It
was a strong friendship.  “‘Technology was happening on the side. Largely I was
building things that I was great at and Steve wanted to have
importance in the world, he wanted to have companies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
