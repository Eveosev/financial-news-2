Business activity in  Canada 
slowed in Sept., according to the Ivey Purchasing Managers Index.  The associationâ€™s monthly index of business activity
fell to 55.7 last month, compared with 56.4 in August. An 
index above 50 means the number of firms who said business
improved was greater than the number saying it deteriorated.
