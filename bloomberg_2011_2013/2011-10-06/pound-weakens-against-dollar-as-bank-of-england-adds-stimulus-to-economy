The pound tumbled against the dollar
and the euro after the  Bank of England  unexpectedly added
stimulus to revive the economy.  Sterling slid 0.9 percent to $1.5326 as of 12:02 p.m. in
 London , and weakened 0.8 percent to 87 pence per euro.  Policy makers will increase their bond-purchase program by
75 billion pounds. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predicted no change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
