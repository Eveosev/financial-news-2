Gannett Co., publisher of newspapers
including  USA Today , promoted Gracia Martore to chief executive
officer after Craig Dubow resigned for medical reasons.  Martore, 60, has been president and chief operating officer
at the company, and had overseen Dubow’s duties during his
recent leave of absence, which was announced on Sept. 15.  Dubow, 56, in recent years had hip and back surgery and has
continued to experience chronic related issues, according to
Robin Pence, a company spokeswoman. Dubow, who had been the
company’s CEO since 2005, took a four-month leave of absence in
2009 following back surgery.  As the newspaper industry has struggled and advertising has
dropped amid the economic decline, Dubow cut costs at McLean,
Virginia-based Gannett, which owns 23 television stations and 82
newspapers including USA Today. Revenue declined in each of the
past four years, for a 32 percent drop to $5.44 billion in 2010.
In June, the company cut 700 jobs at its community-newspaper
group.  Marjorie Magner, 62, a managing director at New York-based
private-equity firm Brysam Global Partners and an independent
director on the company’s board since 2006, was named to replace
Dubow as chairman of the board.  Gannett fell 1 cent to $10.45 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Dubow’s resignation was announced after the market had
closed. The stock has dropped 31 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
