Canadian building permits fell for a
second consecutive month in August, with the province of Ontario
leading declines in residential and non-residential projects.  The value of municipal permits fell 10.4 percent to a
seasonally adjusted C$5.90 billion ($5.67 billion), following a
revised 0.4 percent decline in July,  Statistics Canada  said
today in Ottawa. The drop was larger than any of the 12
responses to a Bloomberg survey of economists, which had a
median forecast for a 0.3 percent advance.  The Canadian economy shrank in the second quarter and
August saw stock prices decline globally after  U.S. government
debt  lost a top credit rating and investors focused on  Europe â€™s
debt crisis. Tighter mortgage rules set out by Finance Minister
 Jim Flaherty  earlier this year have also slowed home purchases.  Permits for non-residential construction dropped 16.6
percent to C$2.27 billion in August, Statistics Canada said.  Commercial projects such as office buildings and
restaurants declined 20.6 percent and institutional work fell
17.1 percent, led by lower intentions for schools. Industrial
work rose 1.8 percent in August, following a drop of 40.6
percent in July.  Residential permits fell 6 percent to C$3.62 billion in
August, Statistics Canada said. Multiple-unit work fell 8.9
percent to C$1.43 billion and single-family permits decreased
4.1 percent to C$2.19 billion.  The value of permits in Ontario, the most populous
province, dropped 21.9 percent to C$1.93 billion, Statistics
Canada said.  The nationwide value of building permits was 3.9 percent
higher in August than the same month a year earlier, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
