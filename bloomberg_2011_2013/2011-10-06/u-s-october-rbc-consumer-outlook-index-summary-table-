U.S. consumer sentiment fell 
in October, according to the RBC Financial Group.  The groupâ€™s index measuring consumer attitudes fell to 
39.2 in October from 40.2 a month earlier. The index was
formulated from a poll of 1,007 adults from Sept. 29 to Oct. 2.  NOTE: In November 2010 the the Outlook Index was rescaled to correspond
with 0-100 scale to maximize interpretability -- a score over 50 represents
above-average  consumer confidence  and a score below 50 indicates below-
average consumer confidence.   To contact the reporter on this story:
