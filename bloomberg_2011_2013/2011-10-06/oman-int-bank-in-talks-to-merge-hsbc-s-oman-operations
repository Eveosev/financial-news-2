HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  is in talks to
merge its operations in Oman with  Oman International Bank SAOG (OIBB) ,
the Gulf country’s fifth-biggest bank by assets.  “These discussions are at a preliminary stage,” HSBC,
Europe’s biggest bank, said today in a statement.  HSBC in August said it would eliminate 30,000 jobs by the
end of 2013, pulling back from some countries, to help control
costs. The London-based bank agreed in July to sell its upstate
New York branch network, comprising almost half its U.S.
outlets, to First Niagara Financial Group Inc. and said it will
close its 10 branches in  Poland .  HSBC offers retail and corporate banking services in Oman.
Its Middle East unit plans to cut 200 jobs in six countries in
the region, according to a memo sent to employees on Sept. 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
