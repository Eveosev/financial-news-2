President  Barack Obama  said  China  has
been aggressive in “gaming the trading system,” including
intervening to keep the value of its currency artificially low.  “China has been very aggressive in gaming the trading
system to its advantage and to the disadvantage of other
countries, particularly the United States,” Obama said in
response to a question at a White House news conference.
“Currency manipulation is one example of it, or at least
intervening in the currency markets in ways that have led their
currency to be valued lower than the market would normally
dictate.”  Still, Obama warned that legislation in the Senate to
penalize China risked triggering trade sanctions against the
