Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s biggest
bank, was sued by Loreley Financing over $440 million worth of
collateralized debt obligations purchased from 2005 to 2007.  The bank is accused of defrauding the plaintiffs into
purchasing CDOs that were “destined -- and indeed, designed --
to fail,” Loreley Financing said in a complaint filed yesterday
in New York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan .  Each of the collateralized debt obligations was “a
fraudulent investment vehicle created and exploited by
defendants for their own benefit and the benefit of certain
preferred Deutsche Bank clients looking to profit from the
imminent collapse of the subprime mortgage market,” Loreley
Financing said in the complaint.  Loreley Financing is a group of special purpose entities
based in Jersey, the largest of the  Channel Islands , a
dependency of the U.K. with its own legislative assembly and
known as a tax haven. The entities were formed for long-term
investing in CDOs, pools of assets such as mortgage bonds
packaged into new securities, Loreley Financing said in the
complaint.  “We believe these claims are unfounded and will vigorously
defend against them,” Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank said in a
statement.  The case is Loreley Financing (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v.
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., 652737/2011, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
