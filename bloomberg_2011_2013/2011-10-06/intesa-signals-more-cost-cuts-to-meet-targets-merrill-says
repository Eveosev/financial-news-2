Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  Chief Executive
Officer Corrado Passera indicated the bank will impose “more
aggressive” cost reductions to offset bad-debt provisions,
according to a note from  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)   “Passera reconfirmed the 2011, 2013 and 2015 targets,
although there looks to be an adjustment between more aggressive
cost cuts offsetting provisions, with evidence of this in the
third quarter,” according to a note obtained by Bloomberg News
and e-mailed to clients by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which
hosted Passera at a conference in  London  today.  An Intesa spokesman declined to comment. The Milan-based
bank, whose stock has lost a third of its value this year as
 Europe ’s debt crisis spread to  Italy , is shedding jobs and
reducing costs to strengthen its finances. Intesa’s five-year
plan, approved in April, targets net income of 4.2 billion euros
($5.6 billion) by 2013 and 5.6 billion euros in 2015.  Intesa isn’t interested in combining with smaller Italian
lenders, Bank of America Merrill Lynch cited Passera as saying.
Passera also confirmed that he expects to maintain a core tier 1
ratio, a measure of financial strength, at 10 percent for the
rest of the business plan, the brokerage said.  Asked about a possible plan to recapitalize European banks,
Passera indicated that “if the problem is sovereign debt, cure
this and not the consequences of the sovereign debt,” the note
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
