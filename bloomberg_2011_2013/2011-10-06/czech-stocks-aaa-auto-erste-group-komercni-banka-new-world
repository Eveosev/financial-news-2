The  Czech Republic ’s PX stock index

Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  AAA Auto Group NV (AAA)   increased 3.3 percent to 17.99

more vehicles between January and September than a year earlier.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   of Austria jumped 10 percent

Societe Generale SA, rose 5.3 percent to 3,439 koruna.  Financial stocks were among the biggest gainers in  Europe

producer in the Czech Republic, increased 6.1 percent, the most
in almost two months, to 131 koruna. Coal futures contracts rose
