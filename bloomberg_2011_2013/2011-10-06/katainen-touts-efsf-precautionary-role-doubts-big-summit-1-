Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen 
said Europe needs to build a firewall to protect healthy
countries from the fallout of  Greece ’s oversized debt, while
playing down expectations of a “big” breakthrough at this
month’s euro summit.  Katainen said the Oct. 18 summit won’t decide on Greece’s
next 8 billion-euro ($11 billion) loan installment, leaving that
judgment to finance ministers on the basis of a Greek economic
assessment due in mid-October.  “We have to talk about the situation, but I don’t expect
big decisions from the meeting,” Katainen told reporters in
Brussels today. “We have to prepare ourselves for safeguarding
the banking sector and ringfencing other countries.”  Drawing lessons from  Finland ’s rescue of its banking system
during the recession of the early 1990s, Katainen said bank-
repair work is primarily a national responsibility.  Only when national funding falls short should  Europe ’s
rescue fund step in as a “lender of last resort,” Katainen
said. The best use of the soon-to-be-upgraded fund, known as the
 European Financial Stability Facility , is to offer credit lines
to otherwise healthy governments, he said.  Katainen portrayed the expanded EFSF, likely to be
operational by mid-month, as an “insurance company” that is
not the “first solution” for bolstering national banking
systems.  He also called for a stronger role for the Brussels-based
 European Commission  in policing euro-area deficit rules and
national competitiveness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
