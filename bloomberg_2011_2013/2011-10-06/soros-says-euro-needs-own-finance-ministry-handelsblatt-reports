The euro-area countries should move
without delay toward establishing a joint finance ministry to
gain control over the debt crisis, according to billionaire
investor George Soros,  Handelsblatt  reported.  Soros told the newspaper the  European Central Bank  should
give major banks in the euro area temporary guarantees and
permanent recapitalization funds. The ECB should also allow
countries including Italy and Spain to refinance their debts at
lower  interest rates , Handelsblatt cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
