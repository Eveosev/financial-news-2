Banks holding a 20 percent of the 4.9
billion-euro ($6.5 billion) loan used by  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) 
to buy 20 percent of  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  wonâ€™t agree to a rollover,
 Expansion  reported, citing unidentified people close to the
matter.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , which holds a 10 percent of the loan, or
about 500 million euros, may head the group of lenders declining
to roll over the loan, the newspaper said.  Other lenders in the group would be  ING Groep NV (INGA) ,  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  or several Portuguese lenders
including  Banco BPI SA (BPI) , Expansion said. More than 40 lenders
participated in the loan, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
