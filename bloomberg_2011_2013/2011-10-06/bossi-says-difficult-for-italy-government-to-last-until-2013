Northern League leader  Umberto Bossi ,
whose party is a key part of the ruling coalition, said it’s
“objectively difficult” for Italy’s government to see out the
end of its term in 2013.  “I think it’s objectively difficult to get to 2013,” he
told reporters in Rome today. “You can’t rip off people and
then get their vote.”  Bossi added that he backs Treasury Director General
Vittorio Grilli to succeed  Mario Draghi  as Bank of Italy
governor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
