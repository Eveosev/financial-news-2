DP World Ltd. (DPW) , Dubai’s state-
controlled port operator, has agreed on a 20-year financing with
a group of international banks to fund its  London Gateway  deep-
sea port.  The company, which said it will invest an additional $1
billion on the project over the next three years, will use an
equal mix of debt and equity to finance the project and plans to
draw down on the debt by mid-2012 after completing equity
investments, DP World said in an  investor presentation  posted on
its website.   DP World, the world’s fourth-largest port operator, revised
its group capital expenditure for 2010-2012 to $2.7 billion
including the additional London Gateway investment, it said. A
further $600 million will be included in group capital
expenditure for  London  Gateway, split between 2013 and 2014 with
the majority coming in 2013, according to the presentation.  The company said on Oct. 4 that the port, on the Thames
river about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of London and adjacent
to a logistics park, will begin operating by the fourth quarter
of 2013 and will have capacity for 1.6 million 20-foot
containers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
