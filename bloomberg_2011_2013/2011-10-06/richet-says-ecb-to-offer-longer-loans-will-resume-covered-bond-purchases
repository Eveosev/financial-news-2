European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet said the ECB will offer banks additional longer-
term liquidity and also restart its covered bond purchases.  The ECB will offer banks one 12-month loan, starting in
October, and a second 13-month loan in December. Both will be
operated as fixed rate, full allotment operations. It will also
start buying 40 billion euros of covered bonds in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
