The government of Baden-Wuerttemberg
violated the state constitution when it authorized 4.7 billion
euros in guarantees as part of the purchase of a 45 percent
stake in  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) , a court ruled.  The Baden-Wuerttemberg constitutional court ruled the
government shouldn’t have authorized the guarantees without
asking the state legislature for approval beforehand. The case
was brought by the Green party and the  Social Democrats , the
court said in an e-mailed statement today. Both parties formed
the opposition when they filed the suit and are now the ruling
coalition in the German state.  “Using an emergency authorization in cases where there is
enough time to ask parliament isn’t backed by the state
constitution,” the court said today. “Volatility in the
capital markets doesn’t justify waiving parliament’s vote which
has the primary say on budgetary issues.”  Electricite de France SA,  Europe ’s biggest power generator,
sold the stake in the utility on Dec. 6. The state of Baden-
Wurttemberg offered 41.50 euros a share, representing a 19
percent premium on the share price at the time. Former state
prime minister Stefan Mappus justified the emergency approval
with regulatory constraints and the need to keep the deal
secret, the court said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
