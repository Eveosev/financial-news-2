Dubai shares rose for the first time
in seven days after  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)  won a contract in India
and on investors’ optimism European policy makers will move to
contain the continent’s debt crisis.  Arabtec, the United Arab Emirates’ biggest construction
company, advanced the most in two months.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) 
surged the most since August 29. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
climbed 0.8 percent to 1,395.43 at the 2:00 p.m. close in the
emirate, trimming this week’s decline to 2.5 percent. About 41
million shares traded today, compared with this year’s daily
average of 111 million shares. The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index,
which tracks the biggest 200 companies in the Persian Gulf
region, rose 0.4 percent.  “Indexes in the U.A.E. are in positive territory due to a
supportive global backdrop,” said  Julian Bruce , equity sales
head at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai. “Arabtec news was well
received but volumes are still light and buyers are still
exercising caution ahead of the weekend.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1.9 percent. European
Union officials are working on plans to boost bank capital to
contain the debt crisis, the  International Monetary Fund  said.
Banks need the region’s regulators to help with financing to
prevent the debt crisis from worsening, said UniCredit SpA Chief
Executive Officer Federico Ghizzoni in an interview.  Arabtec rose 2.3 percent, the most since Aug. 10, to 1.33
dirhams. The Arabtec Construction LLC-Raheja venture won a
