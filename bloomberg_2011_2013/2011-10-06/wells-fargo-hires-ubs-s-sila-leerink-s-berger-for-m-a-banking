Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the lender that’s
expanding investment-banking operations as rivals scale back,
hired two mergers-and-acquisitions bankers.  Bora Sila, previously with  UBS AG (UBSN) , will head consumer and
retail M&A, and Adam Berger will lead health-care M&A, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said today in a statement. Berger,
44, ran M&A for Boston-based Leerink Swann & Co. from 2008 until
earlier this year and has worked on almost $400 billion in deals
during his 22-year career, according to the statement.  “As we continue to strategically expand our capabilities
and add depth to our team, their extensive relationships and
industry knowledge will greatly enhance our ability,” John Laughlin, Wells Fargo’s head of M&A, said in the statement.  Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf , 58, is bolstering the
investment-banking unit acquired as part of Wells Fargo’s 2008
takeover of Wachovia Corp. The lender hired a team of 25 bankers
and analysts from Citadel LLC in August, when the Chicago-based
hedge fund opted to exit the securities business.  Sila, 50, led Americas retail investment banking at UBS,
Switzerland’s largest lender, which has lost at least 50
dealmakers from its U.S. investment bank since 2009. He has
advised Andrew Puzder, 61, the CEO of Carpinteria, California-
based CKE Restaurants Inc., which owns Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s
hamburger chains, according to a 2008 interview.  Sila and Berger are based in New York and report to
Laughlin.  Wells Fargo rose 87 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $25.37 at
4:15 p.m. in  New York  trading. The shares have dropped 18
percent this year, compared with a 29 percent decline for the
24-company KBW Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
