The Philippines’ Bureau of Customs
collected 20.2 billion pesos in September, lower than target due
to “turnover jitters,” Commissioner Ruffy Biazon told
reporters in  Manila  today.  The agency’s targets for this year and next have been
lowered, he said. Its collection goal in 2012 was reduced to 312
billion pesos from 365 billion pesos, he said, without giving
the new target for 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
