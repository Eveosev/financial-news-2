Nissan Motor Co. and  Renault SA (RNO)  plan
to build a second factory in Brazil and upgrade an existing one
to increase market share in the largest Latin American economy,
Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said.  The new plant is to be built in Resende, in Rio de Janeiro
state, said Ghosn today at a news conference in Brasilia after
talks with President Dilma Rousseff. The factory in Sao Jose dos
Pinhais, in Parana state, is to be upgraded. Ghosn said more
details about both plants will be released next week.  “Brazil is going to be Renault’s second-biggest market in
the world by the end of this year,” said Ghosn, who is
Brazilian-born. “We want to be able to go beyond our present 8
percent market share in  Brazil .”  Car sales have been increasing more than 20 percent a year
for the past few years in Brazil, the fifth-biggest auto market
in the world. To keep its market from being flooded by cheaper
foreign cars, Brazil on Sept. 15 raised its tax on autos with
less than 65 percent of their content produced in the country,
Mercorsur or Mexico.  Ghosn said the 65 percent local-content requirement is not
unusual, with it being closer to 90 percent in  China , and it’s
no impediment for investing in Brazil.  He said details about the amount to be invested, the
capacity of the factories and the number of new jobs to be
created will be disclosed Oct. 5 at the Sao Jose dos Pinhais
plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
