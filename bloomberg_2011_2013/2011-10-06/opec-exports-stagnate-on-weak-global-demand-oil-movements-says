The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will keep shipment levels unchanged through
most of this month as the economic slump constrains demand,
according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC will export about 22.72 million barrels a day in the
four weeks to Oct. 22, little changed from the 22.74 million a
day shipped in the month to Sept. 24, the Halifax, England-based
company said today in a report. Shipments usually rise at this
time of year as refiners prepare to boost production of winter
fuels. The figures exclude  Ecuador  and Angola.  “It’s very weak by seasonal standards,” Roy Mason, Oil
Movements’ founder, said by telephone. “Western demand is bound
to be weakened by the economic situation, but the slow growth in
eastbound shipments from the Gulf is more puzzling. The tanker
market is dead and digging deeper.”  Shipments from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will also be little changed at 17.42
million barrels a day, according to Oil Movements estimates.
Crude on board tankers will average 466.16 million barrels in
the four-week period, down 0.3 percent from 467.45 million
barrels in the period to Sept. 24, the researcher said.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by keeping a tally of
tanker-rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on
board ships as floating storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait,  Libya ,  Nigeria , Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The organization will meet next on Dec.
14 in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
