Airbus SAS has delivered more planes
and taken more orders this year than U.S. rival  Boeing Co. (BA) ,
edging within reach of a record after introducing its upgraded
single-aisle jet, the A320neo.  Airbus has won 1,038 net aircraft orders, after 141
cancellations during the first nine months, the Toulouse,
France-based company said today in a statement. That includes
918 neos, which offer more fuel-efficient engines than the
existing A320 family.  Airbus’s record tally for net new orders was in 2007, with
contracts for 1,341. An order today from  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  for
110 A320s, will be included in the October listing. Combined
with the prospect of additional orders at the Dubai Air Show in
November, that put Airbus in reach of topping its previous high.  Boeing has won 426 net orders this year, which are listed
today on the Chicago-based planemaker’s  website  and exclude 105
canceled contracts. Cancellations are generally for planes
ordered some years ago, though they are counted against the
current-year order tally. The net orders are up from 392 in the
same period of 2010.  For deliveries, Airbus has handed over 374 planes this
year, including 296 single-aisle aircraft, 62 widebodies, and 16
A380s. Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co., aims to deliver about 530 planes this year, including about
25 of its double-decker A380s. The next A380 delivery is to
China Southern Airlines Co., set for next week.  Airbus Order Competition  Airbus has topped Boeing’s deliveries every year since
2003, and that trend continued in the first three quarters of
this year.  Boeing handed over 349 aircraft through September,
including 281 single-aisle 737s, 14 767s, 53 of its most-
profitable 777s and its very first 787 Dreamliner, according to
a statement today. The company forecasts deliveries of between
485 to 495 planes in 2011.  In the third quarter, deliveries rose to 127 from 124 a
year earlier. Planemakers get about 40 percent of their payments
from customers upon delivery.  While Airbus has booked 918 firm orders from 14 customers
for its A320neo since offering the plane last December, Boeing
hasn’t yet won any firm contracts for its new 737 MAX. The
company has said it has 496 preliminary commitments from five
customers.  Boeing announced in August that it planned to build the 737
variant, with new engines, and has been working to complete its
configuration.  “We continue to work a number of details,”  Marc Birtel , a
Boeing spokesman, said yesterday. “These commitments will book
once those details are finalized, but we are not able to
speculate on when that will be.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
