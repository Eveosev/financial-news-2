Germany ’s commercial banks are in a
“stable” condition and it’s unlikely that the debt crisis will
deprive a German lender of its ability to obtain funding as
happened to Dexia SA, said  Michael Kemmer , managing director of
bank lobby group BdB on  Deutschlandfunk .  Dexia is probably a “special case” because of its
exposure to European  government bonds , Kemmer said today on the
broadcasting network. Kemmer said the volume of interbank
lending in Germany has declined “markedly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
