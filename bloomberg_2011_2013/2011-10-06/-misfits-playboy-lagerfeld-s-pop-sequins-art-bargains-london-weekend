In “ The Playboy of the Western
World ” a lanky, sweet-talking lad surfaces in a village in
County Mayo declaring that he killed his dad.  So of course, he’s fought over by all the women, including
the hard-nosed daughter of the pub owner. Then his luck turns in
this Irish tragicomedy J.M. Synge wrote in 1907.  The title role is played by Robert Sheehan, a 23-year-old 
from the U.K. TV series “Misfits.”  At the Old Vic until Nov. 26. Information:

to eat at this inexpensive restaurant, which serves classic
dishes from the U.K. and  France . While it’s informal and
unpretentious, the cooking is serious. Information:

featured in the Victoria and Albert Museum’s autumn show.  Lagerfeld is proposed as a power broker in a sweeping
exhibition on Postmodernism (1970-90) -- a potpourri movement
that blended past and future, classic and modern, Versailles and
 Las Vegas , and that curators themselves admit is hard to define.  After a dry start, the show takes off with fun samples of
1980s pop culture: from the tired original turntables of hip-hop
pioneer Grandmaster Flash, to the androgynous checked pantsuit
worn by Annie Lennox and the music videos of Kraftwerk.  Leave with a box set featuring Blondie and Depeche Mode.  “Postmodernism: Style and Subversion 1970-1990” ends Jan.
15, 2012. Information:  http://www.vam.ac.uk  or +44-20-7942-2000.  Saturday Night  It’s been a long time gone since Crosby, Stills & Nash made
“Almost Cut My Hair.” Even so, they still sound harmonious and
fresh. David Crosby and Graham Nash are playing London tonight:
close your eyes when they sing “Marrakesh Express” and it
could -- almost -- be  Morocco  in 1969.  Royal Albert Hall,  Kensington Gore , SW7 2AP. Information:

modern Provencal bistro with a bar that features a menu of
cocktails from the Cote d’Azur. All cocktails are half price
from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. daily, and dishes may include lobster
linguini or herb-crusted rack of lamb. Information:

2008-9 -- and who goes back to his roots with the solo “Desh.” 
Sets are by Oscar winner Tim Yip (who designed “Crouching Tiger
Hidden Dragon”), and the show ends Saturday. Information:

prices from a few hundred pounds. It runs Oct. 6 to 11 at the
Royal Hospital, Chelsea, SW3. Information:

by Clive Arrowsmith and Jillian Edelstein -- whose previous

Saturday in a temporary studio outside the National Theatre. A
total of 400 people, 100 a day, can get their portraits shot for
free in a first-come-first-served basis.  The winners get a photo to take away, with the image
projected onto the theater in the evening. Those who miss out
can still get their photo taken by other roving photographers on
the South Bank or upload their own image for projection via

pounds ($3) to Save the Children for each one used.  (Farah Nayeri writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
