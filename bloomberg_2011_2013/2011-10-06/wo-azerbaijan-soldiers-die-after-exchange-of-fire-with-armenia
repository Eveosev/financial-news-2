Two Azeri soldiers were killed during
an exchange of fire with Armenian troops along the former Soviet
republics’ militarized cease-fire line yesterday, Azerbaijan’s
 Defense Ministry  said.  The servicemen were fatally wounded while “repelling
Armenian attacks” near the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh,
ministry spokesman Teymur Abdullayev said by phone today in the
capital, Baku.  Oil-rich Azerbaijan fought a war with Armenia over Nagorno-
Karabakh, a majority Armenian-populated enclave that broke free
of Baku’s control following the disintegration of the Soviet
Union in 1991. The territory remains a potential flash point in
a region where Russia fought a five-day war with Georgia in 2008
after separatist tensions flared up.  While the hostilities largely ended after a Russia-brokered
cease-fire in 1994, the countries have failed to reach a peace
agreement. Companies led by London-based  BP Plc (BP/)  have invested
more than $31 billion in  Azerbaijan ’s oil and gas fields since
1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
