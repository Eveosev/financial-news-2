the region’s banks and the U.S. reported a smaller increase in

not fundamental demand. It’s the same old culprits: fast-money,
traders trying to make a buck before the next leg comes down.”  The S&P/TSX rebounded 2.5 percent from a 14-month low
yesterday after the Institute for Supply Management’s monthly

benchmark gauge tumbled 20 percent in the six months ending
yesterday on concern about the European debt crisis and the
