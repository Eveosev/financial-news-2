Mironovskiy Hleboproduct SA’s corn
yield will be 20 percent higher than planned this year, helping
the Ukrainian agriculture company meet this year’s grain target,
First Deputy Chief Executive Officer Yuriy Melnyk said.  Average corn yields stand at 10 metric tons per hectare
(2.47 acres) after MHP harvested corn from 12,000 hectares,
Melnyk said in an e-mailed statement in Kiev today. MHP planned
corn yields at 7.8 tons per hectare and has a total 111,000
hectares of corn to be harvested this year, Melnyk said.  Ukraine is counting on a record corn harvest of as much as
18 million tons this year after favorable weather boosted output
and farmers increased corn plantings, Agriculture Minister
Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said last month. The country’s grain harvest
may reach the 2008 record of 53 million tons, the ministry said.  MHP’s average wheat yield totaled 5 tons per hectare, lower
than the plan for 5.6 tons per hectare, Melnyk said. Average
wheat yields in Ukraine totaled 3.47 tons per hectare this year,
according to the  Agriculture Ministry .  Rapeseed yields were an average 2.8 tons per hectare,
compared with a planned 3.4 tons per hectare, Melnyk said.
Sunflower, which will be harvested from 28,800 hectares, so far
has average yields of 2.85 tons per hectare, he said, adding
that sunflower harvesting is near completion.  MHP is planning to increase barley and rapeseed planting
for winter and to seed less winter wheat, Melnyk said. Dry
weather caused a delay in winter grain and rapeseed planting, he
said.  The company planted 13,800 hectares of winter rapeseed,
compared with 10,900 hectares last year, according to Melnyk.
Winter wheat was planted on 23,000 hectares, or 45 percent of
the planned areas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
