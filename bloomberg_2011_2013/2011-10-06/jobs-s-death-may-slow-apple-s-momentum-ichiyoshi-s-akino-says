Mitsushige Akino, chief  fund manager 
at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo, comments on the
death of Steve Jobs, co-founder and former chief executive
officer of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   “It’s possible that the company’s growth will slow down
after losing this charismatic manager. It will be difficult to
keep up its past momentum.  “The product cycle for electronic goods is very short. A
new Apple-like company will probably come along.”  On Apple’s share price:  “Apple’s shares may be sold temporarily, but this news was
expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
