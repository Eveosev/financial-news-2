Venezuela ’s consumer prices rose 1.6
percent nationwide in September as the pace of monthly price
increases slowed, said a government official familiar with the
inflation report to be released later today.  The inflation rate will begin to decelerate and monthly
inflation may be closer to 1 percent in the coming months, said
the official, who isn’t authorized to speak publicly. The
official declined to say how much prices had risen from a year
earlier.  The central bank is expected to release the full consumer
price report later today. Prices rose 2.2 percent nationwide in
August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
