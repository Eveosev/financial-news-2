European stock-index futures climbed,
indicating the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index will extend a
second weekly advance. Asian shares rose, while U.S. futures
were little changed.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Rio Tinto  Group may lead gains by
commodity producers as the mining companies rallied in Sydney.
Ericsson AB may be active amid a report that Sony Corp. is
getting closer to an agreement to buy the Swedish company’s
stake in their mobile-phone venture.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  may move after
Samsung Electronics Co. reported profit that beat analysts’
estimates.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in December
rose 0.2 percent to 2,241 at 7:07 a.m. in  London , while FTSE 100
Index futures expiring the same month gained 0.4 percent. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index jumped 2 percent, while Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index futures slid 0.2 percent.  “The bulls are back in the driving seat -- at least for
now,” said Cameron Peacock, a market analyst at IG Markets in
 Melbourne . “The focus should probably lie more with the
improved economic data as opposed to the central bank
interventions, so it’s going to make the non-farm payrolls which
are due for release later today even more critical and with
markets sporting some healthy gains over recent days, any
disappointment could easily have traders scrambling to book
profits.”  The Stoxx 600 has rallied 1.8 percent this week amid
speculation policy makers will reach agreement to shield banks
from the crisis and as the  Bank of England  expanded its bond-
purchase program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
