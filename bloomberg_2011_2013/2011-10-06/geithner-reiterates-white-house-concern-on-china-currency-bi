U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said Congress needs to address whether a bill that
would penalize China for the value of its currency violates
international agreements.  “If this bill were to advance, then Congress would, or
should, address the concerns that have been raised about the
consistency of some provisions with our international
commitments,” Geithner told the House Financial Services
Committee today.  The Senate today advanced legislation letting U.S.
companies seek duties to compensate for a Chinese yuan that
lawmakers say is undervalued. The senators approved by a 62-38
margin a motion limiting debate on the bill backed by Democrats
Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Charles Schumer of  New York  and
Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and  Jeff Sessions 
of Alabama.  The legislation, opposed by business groups such as the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, may stall in the House. Republican
Speaker  John Boehner  of Ohio said today that the bill could
start a trade war.  White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Oct.
4 that while the Obama administration shares the legislation’s
goal of ensuring “that our workers and businesses have a more
level playing field with the Chinese,” the measure also raises
“concerns about consistency with our international
obligations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
