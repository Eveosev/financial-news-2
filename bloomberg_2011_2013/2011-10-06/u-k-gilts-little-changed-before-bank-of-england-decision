U.K. benchmark government bonds were
little changed amid speculation the  Bank of England  will restart
a bond-purchase program to help revive the U.K. economy.  The 10-year yield was higher for a second day as European
stocks rallied after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
yesterday she supports recapitalizing European lenders “if
there is a joint assessment that the banks aren’t adequately
capitalized.” The pound swung between gains and losses versus
the euro.  U.K. 10-year gilt yields advanced one basis point to 2.37
percent as of 10:27 a.m. in London. The 3.75 percent security
due September 2021 fell 0.115, or 1.15 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,337) face amount, to 112.155. The two-year note yield was
little changed at 0.58 percent.  The pound traded at 86.35 pence per euro and 118.78 yen and
strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.5487 versus the greenback.  The Monetary Policy Committee will leave its key rate
unchanged at 0.5 percent, according to all 53 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Eleven of 32 economists surveyed
separately predict at least a 50 billion-pound increase in its
so-called quantitative easing program.  “There’s a reasonable chance that the Bank of England
could do something as early as today,” said Afseth. “If not
it’s probably a matter of waiting a month, rather than it not
happening. That ought to give a little bit of support to the
gilts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
