(Corrects crop rotation in penultimate paragraph.)  Soybean output in  Brazil , the world’s
second-largest grower after the U.S., will drop for the first
time in three years as last year’s record yields won’t be
repeated, the country’s  Agriculture Ministry  said today.  Brazil will harvest between 72.2 million and 73.3 million
metric tons of the oilseed next year, down from this year’s 75.3
million tons, the ministry’s Conab forecasting agency said today
in its first 2012 crop forecast in an e-mailed report.  Planting of next year’s crop, which started last month,
will grow an average 2.8 percent and yields will fall 6 percent
as last year’s “extremely favorable weather” isn’t likely to
be repeated, Conab said.  Corn output is forecast to be between 57.3 million and 59
million tons, compared with 57.5 million tons in 2011, Conab
said. The planted crop area will expand about 3.6 percent as
rising prices encourage farmers to switch to corn from soybeans.  Corn prices rose 25 percent in the past year, while soybean
gained 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
