Residual-fuel inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
14 percent to the lowest since February, according to a unit of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore supplies including fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen dropped 2.75 million barrels in
the week to yesterday to 17.02 million,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the lowest
since the seven days ended Feb. 16.  Stockpiles of middle distillates including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene declined 1.4 million barrels, or 9.9
percent, to 12.73 million. That’s the lowest in four weeks,
based on the ministry’s data.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate increased 862,000 barrels, or 9.1 percent, to
10.32 million, a 10-week high.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
