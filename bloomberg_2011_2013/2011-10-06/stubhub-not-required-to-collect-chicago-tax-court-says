StubHub Inc., the online ticket
reselling unit of  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , isn’t required to collect a  Chicago 
amusement tax, the  Illinois  Supreme Court said.  Chicago, the third-largest city in the U.S., sued StubHub
in 2008, claiming it had sold tickets for thousands of events in
the city since 2000 without collecting and remitting the tax. A
federal trial court dismissed of the case, and Chicago
challenged that ruling.  A Chicago-based U.S. appellate panel asked the state
Supreme Court whether a municipality could require an Internet
intermediary to act as its taxing agent.  While the state’s highest court agreed that San Francisco-
based StubHub is a ticket reseller’s agent as defined by Chicago
law, the seven-judge panel unanimously decided that only the
state, not its municipalities, can impose a taxing obligation on
online auctioneers.  “The city has overstepped its home rule authority,” the
court said today.  StubHub bills itself as the world’s largest ticket market.
Its website lists as partners the  New York Yankees , the
University of  Texas  and more than 60 major teams in baseball,
basketball, hockey and pro and college football. EBay, based in
 San Jose ,  California , bought StubHub for $310 million in 2007.  Auction Listings  Registered with Illinois as an Internet Auction Listings
Service, StubHub is in compliance with state laws exempting it
from collecting taxes on tickets resold by third parties through
its website, according to today’s  decision .  “We are pleased with the court’s ruling,” Lance
Lanciault, head of legal affairs for StubHub, said in an e-
mailed statement. “The court recognized that there still exists
a viable mechanism for Illinois municipalities to collect taxes
from ticket resellers.”  StubHub charges ticket buyers 10 percent of the purchase
price and sellers a 15 percent fee, the court said. It also
informs sellers of their tax obligations.  The city, which adopted its conflicting ordinance in 2006,
had sought a court order compelling StubHub to submit to an
audit and to pay a judgment in the amount of the municipality’s
claimed tax revenue, plus interest and penalties.  Roderick Drew, a spokesman for Chicago’s law department,
called the  supreme court  opinion “unfair” and said it deprives
the city of revenue.  “For decades, amusement taxes have been a mainstay of local
government funding,” Drew said. “Patrons buying tickets from
online resellers such as StubHub, unlike patrons who purchase
their tickets directly from the venue, will not pay the
amusement tax on the full value of their ticket.”  The case is City of Chicago v. StubHub Inc., Illinois
Supreme Court, 2011 IL 111127. The federal appeal is City of
Chicago, Illinois v. StubHub! Inc., 09-3432, U.S. 7th Circuit
Court of Appeals (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
