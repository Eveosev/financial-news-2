U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  will tell lawmakers that the European financial crisis
is increasing the risks to global growth, according to testimony
prepared for delivery tomorrow.  “Our direct financial exposure to those governments and
their financial institutions is quite small, but  Europe  is so
large and so closely integrated with the U.S. and world
economies that a severe crisis in Europe could cause significant
damage by undermining confidence and weakening demand,”
Geithner says in testimony to the House Financial Services
Committee.  Geithner calls for a more “powerful financial backstop”
for European banks and government borrowers, one that is
“conditioned on policy actions that credibly address the
underlying causes of concern.”  His remarks, obtained by Bloomberg News, come in testimony
for hearings before the House Financial Services Committee and
Senate Banking Committee on the previously released annual
report of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The FSOC
next meets on Oct. 11.  He calls on Congress to take steps to strengthen the  U.S.
economy  and makes a pitch for President Barack Obama’s $447
billion jobs plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
