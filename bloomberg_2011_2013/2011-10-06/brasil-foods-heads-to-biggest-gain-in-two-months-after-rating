BRF- Brasil Foods  SA,  Brazil ’s biggest
maker of microwave dinners and frozen meat products, headed for
its biggest gain in two months after  Barclays Capital  began
coverage of the shares with an “overweight” rating.  Brasil Foods advanced 3.3 percent to 32.04 reais in Sao
Paulo trading at 2:05 p.m. New York time. The shares are up 17
percent this year.  The company, formed from the merger of Perdigao and Sadia
SA, should benefit from “pricing power” and advantages
stemming from a market share that exceeds that of competitors,
Barclays analyst Gabriel Vaz de Lima wrote in a report dated
yesterday.  Brasil Foods’ size will help insulate it from pressure to
offer price discounts, boosting revenue, Barclays said. Net
income will rise in the fourth quarter because of lower grain
prices and a weaker real, which bolsters profit margins on
exports, the bank said.  Barclays assigned a 12-month price target of 43 reais on
the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
