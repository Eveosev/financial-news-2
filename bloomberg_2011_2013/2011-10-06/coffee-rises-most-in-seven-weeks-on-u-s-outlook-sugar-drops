Coffee futures jumped the most in
seven weeks on signs that weakness in the U.S. labor market
eased, bolstering demand for most commodities. Sugar fell.  Claims for  unemployment benefits  increased less than
forecast last week, government data showed. Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week that the central bank
was ready to take more steps to support the economy. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials climbed for the
second straight day. Coffee prices rose to a one-week high.  “There’s follow-through buying from the Bernanke comments,
and a lot of fear has come out of the market,” Fain Shaffer,
the president of Infinity Trading Corp. in Medford,  Oregon , said
in a telephone interview. “Money is starting to flow back into
commodities, and funds are coming back to coffee.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery advanced 6.7 cents, or
2.9 percent, to settle at $2.344 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . The gain was the biggest for a most-
active contract since Aug. 17. Earlier, the commodity reached
$2.361, the highest since Sept. 28.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.16 cent, or 0.6
percent, to 24.64 cents a pound in New York. It was the fourth
decline in five sessions.  In London futures trading, robusta coffee and cocoa rose,
while refined sugar dropped on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
