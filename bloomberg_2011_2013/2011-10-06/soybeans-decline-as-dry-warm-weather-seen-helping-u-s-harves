Soybeans dropped as weather
conditions in the Midwest, the largest U.S. producing region,
are likely to help crop development and advance the harvest.
Corn was little changed.  November-delivery soybeans lost as much s 0.5 percent to
$11.585 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, reversing a 0.3
percent gain. Futures were at $11.62 a bushel at 12:54 p.m.
Singapore time.  Dry and warm weather was forecast across the Midwest and
the Delta regions for several days, favoring maturing soybean
and corn crops, and aiding the harvest, Telvent DTN Inc. said in
a forecast yesterday. Rains may fall in some areas of Brazil and
 Argentina , helping support soybean crop development, it said.  “Weather looks good and harvest is advancing well in most
areas of the Midwest,” Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at Phillip
Futures Pte., said in a report e-mailed today. “Soybeans were
lower on fund and commercial selling.”  December-delivery corn was little changed at $6.05 a bushel,
reversing a gain of 0.6 percent.  U.S. production of ethanol, forecast by the government to
use about 40 percent of the nation’s corn crop, climbed last
week by the most since the week ended Aug. 5, according to an
Energy Department report. Output increased 2.6 percent to
863,000 barrels a day in the week ended Sept. 30, rebounding
from its lowest level since Sept. 24, 2010, the report said.  A  bumper crop  in  China , estimated at 181.5 million metric
tons, will do little to add to inventories with demand estimated
at 181.3 million tons,  Abah Ofon , an analyst at Standard
Chartered Plc, said in a report yesterday.  China will “relish the recent collapse in grain prices”
after the government announced the release of 3.7 million tons
of corn from state reserves to boost domestic supply and cool
inflation amid strong demand for feed grains, Ofon said.  Wheat for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to $6.2625 a
bushel, after gaining as much as 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
