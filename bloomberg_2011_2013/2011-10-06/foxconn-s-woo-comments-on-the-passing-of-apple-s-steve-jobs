Louis Woo, Chairman of Foxconn
Technology Group’s retail unit and an assistant to Foxconn
Chairman and Founder Terry Gou, comments on the passing of Steve
Jobs.  Woo, based in  Shanghai , worked for Apple for 12 years
before moving to Foxconn, the manufacturer of Apple’s iPhone and
iPad. Foxconn trades in Taipei as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.  “As someone who has worked for Apple and has been a fan of
Apple for many years, this is really very saddening news. It’s
like someone from the family has passed away.  “He’s changed the way that we use technology for so many
years, and defined the way technology can better be used, and
better be applied to our day to day use.  “He’s more than a trailblazer. He defined what technology
is supposed to be. We’ll all miss him, and there won’t be
another  Steve Jobs , that’s for sure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
