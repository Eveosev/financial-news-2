Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King 
said he doesn’t think there’ll be so-called global currency wars
as a result of stimulus measures in advanced economies.   “I don’t think that’s right,” King said in a television
interview on  Sky News  today. “Movements in exchange rates are a
safety valve that let the imbalances out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
