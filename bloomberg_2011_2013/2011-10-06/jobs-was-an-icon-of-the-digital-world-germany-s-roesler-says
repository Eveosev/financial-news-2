Steve Jobs , the former chief
executive officer of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  who died yesterday aged 56, was
a model of entrepreneurship and an “icon of the digital
world,” German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said.  “He still is a role model” and his death is a loss that
“extends far beyond the digital world,” Roesler told reporters
in Berlin today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
