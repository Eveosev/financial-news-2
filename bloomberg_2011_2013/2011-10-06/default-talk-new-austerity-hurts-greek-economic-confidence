Greek economic confidence declined in
September as the government announced additional cuts to
pensions and wages amid heightened concerns the country would
default.  An index measuring short-term confidence among households
and businesses fell to 70.6 from 73.7 in August, the Athens-
based  Foundation for Economic & Industrial Research  said in an
e-mailed report today.  Consumer confidence  dropped 2.4 points to
minus 73.6, it said.  Business expectations “remain adverse in all sectors while
consumer confidence reflects the intense pessimism at the
present and future economic juncture,” the foundation said.  Prime Minister  George Papandreou  presented a 2012 budget
with 6.6 billion euros ($8.7 billion) of extra savings this week
as the government struggles to convince international creditors
it can meet targets for receiving an 8 billion-euro loan
instalment, originally due last month, needed to avoid default.  Greeks will be asked to pay a new property tax on all homes
owned, while public-sector workers will see their salaries cut
by a further 20 percent on average and pensions reduced by 4
percent. The plans also include moving 30,000 state workers into
a labor reserve system that will mean reduced pay and eventual
dismissal. The economy is now forecast to shrink 5.5 percent
this year and 2.5 percent next year, according to the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
