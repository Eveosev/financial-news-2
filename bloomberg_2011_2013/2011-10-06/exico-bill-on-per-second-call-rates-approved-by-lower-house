Mexico ’s lower house of Congress
approved legislation forcing telecommunication carriers to let
customers pay for calls per second instead of rounding to the
nearest minute.  With 327 votes in favor, none against and one abstention,
lawmakers amended a bill to require carriers to offer calls
billed by the second. The per-second rates must be competitive
with plans that offer packages of minutes at a flat rate,
according to the legislation.  Mexican lawmakers and regulators are putting pressure on
wireless carriers to reduce prices for consumers. Earlier this
year, the nation’s Federal Telecommunications Commission forced
America Movil SAB and  Telefonica SA (TEF) , the nation’s largest
mobile-phone carriers, to cut rates charged to connect calls
from other carriers.  America Movil , the Mexico City-based company controlled by
billionaire  Carlos Slim , has about 70 percent of Mexico’s
wireless subscribers. Madrid-based Telefonica has 22 percent.  To become law, the bill must also be approved by the Senate
and would require President Felipe Calderon’s signature.  To contact the reporters on this story:
