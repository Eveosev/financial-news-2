World food prices fell for a third
month in September, the longest stretch of declines in more than
two years, after grain prices slumped amid concern demand will
be hurt by an economic slowdown.  An index of 55 food commodities fell to 225 points last
month from 229.5 points in August, the United Nation’s Rome-
based  Food and Agriculture Organization  said. The gauge reached
a record 237.7 points in February.  Corn futures in Chicago had the biggest monthly slide in at
least 50 years last month, dragging down other grains and taking
pressure off rising living costs across the world.  China ’s
fourth-quarter consumer price index probably rose 4.5 percent,
down from 5 percent in the third quarter, according to the
median of nine estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.  “The only reason prices are coming down is the economic
slowdown,”  Abdolreza Abbassian , a senior economist at the FAO,
said by phone before the report. “If we get more bad demand
news, I wouldn’t be surprised to see prices go lower.”  The global economy will expand 4 percent this year and
next, the  International Monetary Fund  said Sept. 20, cutting its
June forecasts of 4.3 percent in 2011 and 4.5 percent in 2012.  The last time the FAO food-price index dropped more than
two months in a row was between July 2008 and February 2009,
when the index slumped 37 percent from its previous peak of
224.1 points in June 2008. The gauge is still 16 percent above
its year-earlier level of 194 points.  Stocks and commodities dropped last month on concern about
a possible Greek default and a spreading debt crisis in  Europe .
The MSCI Index of stocks fell 9.7 percent in September and the
S&P GSCI Index of commodities dropped 12 percent.  Corn Supplies  U.S. supplies of corn were an estimated 1.128 billion
bushels on Sept. 1, the Department of Agriculture said Sept. 30,
about 20 percent more than the average prediction of 24 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey and signaling slower demand for grain used
in  animal feed  and fuel.  “The key to the falling prices is what’s happening on the
demand side,” the FAO’s Abbassian said.  Corn dropped 23 percent on the Chicago Board of Trade in
September, the biggest monthly decline in records going back to
1959. Wheat plunged 23 percent in the month, the biggest such
drop since March 1974.  The FAO Cereals Price Index dropped to 245.1 points in
September from 252.4 in August, the lowest level since January.  The price slide may attract buyers, according to Abbassian.
Countries will spend a record $1.29 trillion on food imports in
2011, 21 percent more than in 2010, the FAO estimates.  ‘Buy Now’  “A lot of people will say this is an opportunity so
they’re going to buy now,” Abbassian said. “All you need is a
couple million tons of purchases and that puts the market back
up. The upside can be very fast.”  The price of corn in  Chicago  is still 26 percent higher
than a year earlier and rough rice has advanced 27 percent.
Wheat has dropped 4.4 percent in the period.  Higher food costs have sent “tens of millions of people”
into poverty since late 2010, and the world’s hungry people may
soon exceed 1 billion again, Oxfam International said Aug. 3.
The number of malnourished people in the world fell last year to
925 million from 1.02 billion in 2009, according to the FAO.  World food output will have to rise 70 percent by 2050 as
the global population climbs to 9.2 billion from an estimated
6.9 billion in 2010, the FAO estimates. The price of staple
foods including corn will more than double in two decades
without action, Oxfam said in May.  Growth to Slow  Growth in agricultural output will slow to 1.7 percent a
year through 2020, compared with 2.6 percent in the previous
decade, the FAO and the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said in a report in June.  World cereal production will climb to 2.31 billion tons in
2011-12, the FAO said in a separate report today, raising its
estimate by 3 million tons on increased forecasts for wheat and
rice production.  The FAO, set up in 1945 as a specialized UN agency, says it
leads international efforts to defeat hunger and helps
developing countries improve farming. Its mandate includes
lifting nutrition levels and agricultural productivity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
