U.S. stock-index futures maintained
gains after initial jobless claims trailed economists’ estimates
last week.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December rose 0.4 percent to 1,139.7 at 8:31 a.m. in  New York .  Applications for jobless benefits increased by 6,000 in the
week ended Oct. 1 to 401,000, Labor Department figures showed
today. Economists projected 410,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The monthly average
dropped to the lowest level since the end of August.  Earlier gains in futures came as European leaders discussed
recapitalizing struggling banks. The European Commission is
“proposing to have a coordinated action to recapitalize
banks,”  Jose Barroso , the body’s president, said in a video
question-and-answer session.  U.S. stocks rallied yesterday, sending the S&P 500 to its
biggest two-day gain in more than a month, as economic data
topped estimates and investors speculated  Europe  will act to
contain the region’s debt crisis.  Wall Street strategists say the  S&P 500 , after falling
within 1 percent of a  bear market  this week, will post the
biggest fourth-quarter rally in 13 years even after they cut
forecasts at a rate exceeded only during the credit crisis.  Analysts from Oppenheimer & Co. to UBS AG and Barclays Plc
say equities will rebound from a decline of 19 percent since
April as policy makers prevent a default by Greece and profit in
the S&P 500 climb to $95.85 a share in 2011. Europe’s worsening
debt crisis and the U.S. government’s loss of its AAA credit
rating led strategists to cut their S&P 500 forecast in the past
two months from an average level of 1,401.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
