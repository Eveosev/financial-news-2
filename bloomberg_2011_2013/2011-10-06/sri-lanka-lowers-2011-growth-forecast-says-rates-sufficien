Sri Lanka’s economy may grow about
8.3 percent in 2011, less than an earlier forecast of 8.5
percent, due to a decline in agricultural activity in the first
quarter, the central bank’s deputy governor said.  The inflation rate will likely fall to less than 6 percent
by December and the central bank won’t immediately cut benchmark
 interest rates , Dharma Dheerasinghe said in  Colombo  today.  “We think the current monetary stance is sufficient,” he
said. “Unless we see some extraordinary development we will
continue with this policy.”  Sri Lanka’s inflation slowed to a one-year low in September,
as increased food supplies and a 0.7 percent rise in the local
currency against the dollar so far this year helped curb price
gains. Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal has left
borrowing costs unchanged since January to support growth as the
global recovery weakens.  The bank will announce its October monetary policy review
on Monday.   Growth in the $50 billion economy accelerated to 8.2
percent in the three months through June, compared with a 7.9
percent pace in the first quarter. The value of  Sri Lanka ’s
agricultural output expanded 1.9 percent in the three months
through June, after shrinking 5.1 percent in the previous
quarter as floods destroyed crops.  Consumer prices in the capital, Colombo, increased 6.4
percent in September from a year earlier after gaining 7 percent
in August, the Department of Census and Statistics said Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
