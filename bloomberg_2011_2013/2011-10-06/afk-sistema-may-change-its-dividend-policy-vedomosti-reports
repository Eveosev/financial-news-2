OAO AFK Sistema may change its
dividend policy,  Vedomosti  reported today, citing Mikhail
Shamolin, the company’s president.  A management plan, which has yet to be approved by the
board, envisages paying shareholders 10 percent of the company’s
net income plus 10 percent of the profit from asset sales, the
newspaper said.  Under Sistema’s current policy, as much as 40 percent of
net income may be paid to shareholders, but the actual figure is
much lower, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
