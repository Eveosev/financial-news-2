The U.K. government will spend an
extra 300 million pounds ($460 million) to subsidize child care
for part-time workers in an effort to increase incentives for
people to find jobs.  An extra 80,000 households will be able to claim as much as
300 pounds a week toward  child-care costs  after the government
said it would change the current rule that support is only given
to those working more than 16 hours a week. The change will take
effect in 2013.  “We are determined to help more parents take their first
steps into work,” Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith
said in an e-mailed statement in  London  today. “Under the
current minimum-hours rule, parents are trapped in state
dependency without the child-care support they badly need --
providing yet another barrier to work.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
