“Opportunity knocks” in the shares
of coal producers because they have fallen far more than the
commodity’s price would justify, according to Frank Holmes,
chief executive officer of U.S. Global Investors Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the performance of the Market
Vectors coal exchange-traded fund, run by Van Eck Global, and
the IntercontinentalExchange’s Newcastle coal futures for the
past two years.  The ETF tumbled 43 percent between July 22 and Oct. 3 as
five of its holdings -- Alpha Natural Resources Inc., Arch Coal
Inc., Patriot Coal Corp., Peabody Energy Corp. and Walter Energy
Inc. -- reduced profit or production estimates. The Newcastle
index lost 0.4 percent in the same period.  “This extreme divergence between coal companies and the
commodity seems unwarranted,” Holmes, based in  San Antonio ,
wrote in an Oct. 3 blog posting that featured a similar chart.  Holmes wrote that producers still stand to benefit from
rising demand from  China , the world’s largest consumer of coal,
as foreseen by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The
agency estimated last month that Chinese coal use will rise by
an average of 2.1 percent a year from 2008 to 2035, exceeding
the U.S.’s projected 0.5 percent growth rate.  Concern that global economic expansion may slow is already
reflected in coal-stock prices, according to Holmes. “Fear is
the driver” that sent the shares tumbling, he wrote. His firm
manages $2.8 billion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
