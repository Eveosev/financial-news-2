OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-biggest
oil producer, may invest as much as $300 million in exploration
blocks off Romania’s  Black Sea  coast,  Ziarul Financiar  reported
today, citing Constantin Tampiza, the local  spokesman  for
Lukoil’s Chief Executive Officer Vagit Alekperov.  The Russian company won licenses together with Vanco
International to explore for oil and gas in the Black Sea
waters, the Bucharest-based newspaper said today, citing
Tampiza. The company needs an approval from the Romanian Justice
Ministry and a final government decision before it can start its
exploration in the Black Sea, according to Tampiza.  To contact the reporter on this story:
