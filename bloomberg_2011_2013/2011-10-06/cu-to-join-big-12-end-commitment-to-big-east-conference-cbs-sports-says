Texas Christian University  has
received an invitation to join the Big 12 Conference and is
expected to accept the offer in time for the start of the 2012-
2013 football season,  CBSSports.com  is reporting, citing people
it didn’t identify.  The Horned Frogs had earlier committed to join the  Big East 
Conference beginning in July 2012. The Fort Worth, Texas, school
will have to pay a $5 million exit fee, but because it wasn’t an
official member, it won’t have to wait 27 months to change
conferences, CBSSports.com said.  TCU, which currently is in the Mountain West Conference,
replaces  Texas A&M University , which will leave the Big 12
Conference for the Southeastern Conference. If the  University of
Missouri  stays in the conference, the Big 12 will probably stay
at 10 teams. If the Tigers leave, the conference will try to add
three more schools to bring the conference back to 12 teams,
CBSSports.com says.  The Big East earlier lost Pittsburgh and Syracuse to the
Atlantic Coast Conference.  CBSSports.com says if the Big 12 were to add three more
teams, leading candidates would be the University of Louisville,
West Virginia University and the University of Cincinnati of the
Big East, and Brigham Young University, an independent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
