Koichi Ogawa, a chief portfolio
manager of Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. in Tokyo, commented on
 Steve Jobs , co-founder of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   Apple issued a statement saying Jobs died Oct. 5. He
stepped down as chief executive officer of the Cupertino,
Calif.-based company in August after combating a rare form of
cancer.  “It’s the loss of a symbol of U.S. entrepreneurship.  ‘‘It won’t affect Apple, since he had already retired. His
successor needs to keep coming up with innovative products just
like Jobs did.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
