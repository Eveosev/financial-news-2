Brazil ’s federal government may agree
to reduce its share of profits from highly productive oil fields
by a further 700 million reais ($382 million) to help reach
agreement on how to share oil royalties with non-producing
states, Folha de S.Paulo reported, citing unidentified
government officials.  The government may cut the so-called special participation
tax on lucrative fields to 42.5 percent from 50 percent,
according to the newspaper. It had previously agreed to reduce
the tax to 46 percent, Folha said.   The extra measure, which would only go ahead if oil-
producing states also agree to give up some of their income,
would lead to a total reduction in the government’s oil revenue
of as much as 2.5 billion reais next year, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
