The Latvian Finance Ministry raised
this year’s economic growth forecast to 4.5 percent from 3.3
percent and warned that 2012’s expansion may be affected by
global weakness.  “Thanks to stronger than estimated growth in economic
activity,  tax revenue  has developed above the planned level,”
said Finance Minister Andris Vilks, in an e-mailed statement.
“Its possible that at the end of the year, slower growth in the
global economy will slow  Latvia ’s pace of expansion.”  The economy grew 5.6 percent in the second quarter, the
quickest pace in 3 1/2 years, after contracting by almost a
quarter since 2008 following the end of the credit-fueled real-
estate bubble. The government turned to the European Commission
and the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10
billion) loan in 2008 after the second-biggest bank needed a
state rescue.  Ministries should not allow spending to rise in the last
few months of the year due to growth risks, he said. The  budget
deficit  stood at 103.7 million lati ($194 million) in the first
nine months, compared with a shortfall of 353.4 million lati in
the same period a year earlier, according to the statement.  To contact the editor for this story:
