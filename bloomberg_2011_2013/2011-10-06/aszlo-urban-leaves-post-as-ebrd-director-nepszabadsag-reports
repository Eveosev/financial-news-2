Laszlo Urban has returned to  Hungary 
after leaving his post as board member of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development,  Nepszabadsag  reported, without
citing anyone.  A successor for Urban, who oversaw Hungary, Croatia,
Slovakia and the  Czech Republic  at the EBRD since March 2010,
has not been found, the newspaper said.  The move by Urban, a former deputy chief executive officer
at Hungary’s largest lender OTP Bank Nyrt., may be connected to
a possible government shuffle which could leave Economy Minister
Gyorgy Matolcsy’s post vacant, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
