Ukraine’s winter-wheat harvest next
year may be 3 million to 4 million metric tons lower than
estimated after dry weather in September delayed sowing,
according to the national Hydrometeorology Center.  An “incomplete harvest is ensured,” Tetiana Adamenko,
head of the agro-meteorology department at the weather center,
said by phone today from Kiev. Dryness caused farmers to leave
about 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) bare, she said.
Around 18 percent of winter wheat was sown after the optimal
period and 20 percent was never planted.  As much as half of the grain sown for winter will be at
risk and dependent on weather, according to Adamenko. Farmers
may seed barley next spring in fields where crops were lost
because of weather, she said.  Temperatures will decline and rain is likely across most of
Ukraine starting Oct. 8, Adamenko said. Wheat and rapeseed will
require warm weather in November to develop sufficiently for
wintering, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
