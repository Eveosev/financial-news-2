PCCW Ltd. (8)  plans to list its
telecommunications business trust in the first week of November
if shareholders approve the deal at a meeting next week, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  The phone company may start gauging investor demand for its
 HKT Trust  in mid-October, pending approval by an extraordinary
general meeting on Oct. 12, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is private.  PCCW, the biggest phone carrier in  Hong Kong , may raise
more than HK$10 billion ($1.3 billion) from the initial public
offering to repay debt and fund investments, the company said in
a statement on Sept. 25. PCCW may sell 36.7 percent of the units
in HKT Trust in the IPO, according to the statement.  Billionaire Chairman  Richard Li  aims to lure investors to
Hong Kongâ€™s first business trust by offering to pay out a higher
proportion of income from PCCW units including fixed-line phone
services and broadband Internet as dividends. A global stock
market rout caused companies including Sany Heavy Industry Co.
to delay or cancel share sales in the past month.  Anita Choi, a spokeswoman at PCCW in Hong Kong, declined to
comment on the listing timetable.  To contact the reporters on this story:
