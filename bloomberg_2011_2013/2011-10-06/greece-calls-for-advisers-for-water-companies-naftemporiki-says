Greece has invited expressions of
interest from technical advisers to assist in the stake sales of
two listed water companies,  Naftemporiki  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The government plans to sell a 40 percent stake in
 Thessaloniki Water Supply & Sewage Co SA (EYAPS)  and a 27 percent stake
in  Athens Water Supply & Sewage Co SA (EYDAP)  in the first half of 2012,
the newspaper said. Advisers will need to submit their
expressions of interest by Oct. 17, Naftemporiki said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
