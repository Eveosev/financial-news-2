John Corrigan , chief executive
officer of Ireland’s National Treasury Management Agency, said
he’s pressing  ratings agencies  to recognize the progress the
nation has made in dealing with its problems.  It would “nice” if the ratings agencies upgraded Ireland
within 12 months, he told a parliamentary committee in Dublin
today. He said Ireland would seek to re-enter long term debt
markets before its aid program runs out, to avoid being held to
“ransom” by investors.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
