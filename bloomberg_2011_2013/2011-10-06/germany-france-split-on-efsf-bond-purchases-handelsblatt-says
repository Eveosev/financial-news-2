Germany  and  France  are at odds over
whether the European Financial Stability Facility should have
limits on government bond purchases, Handelsblatt reported,
citing an unidentified high-ranking European Union diplomat.  France doesn’t want to restrict the EFSF on how much of its
funds it can use for such purchases, the newspaper said in a
preview of an article to appear in tomorrow’s edition. Germany
wants to limit the amount EFSF can spend for bonds per country
and is also considering whether there should be a time limit for
bond purchases, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
