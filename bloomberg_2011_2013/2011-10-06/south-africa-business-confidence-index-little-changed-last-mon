 South African business confidence
was little changed in September as the outlook for the recovery
in  Africa ’s largest economy remained subdued, the country’s
Chamber of Commerce and Industry said.  Its business confidence index fell to a 16-month low of
98.4 from 98.6 in August, the Johannesburg-based chamber, known
as Sacci, said in an e-mailed statement today. The index is
compiled from 13 economic indicators, including retail sales,
inflation and financial gauges, such as the  stock index  and the
currency.  “Global events did, and will even more so, affect the
South African economy negatively in the months to come,” Sacci
said. “Under the present circumstances, businesses will
experience greater strain as they will not be able to pass on
cost escalations.”  The country’s gross domestic product expanded an annualized
1.3 percent in the second quarter, the slowest pace in almost
two years, as manufacturing and mining output plunged, according
to Statistics South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
