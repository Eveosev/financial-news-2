Cattle futures declined for the
second time this week on speculation the global economy is
slowing, signaling reduced demand for U.S. meat. Hog prices
climbed for the third straight day.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index averaged minus 48.4
from July through September, the weakest reading since the first
quarter of 2009. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
this week that the economic recovery is “close to faltering.”
World food prices fell for a third straight month in September,
the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization said.  “Concerns about the economic outlook are weighing on the
markets,” Dan Vaught, the owner of Vaught Futures Insights in
Altus, Arkansas, said in a telephone interview  Cattle futures for December delivery declined 0.25 cent, or
0.2 percent, to settle at $1.224 a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price has jumped 13 percent
this year, reaching a record $1.23775 on Oct. 4.  Wholesale beef is down 3.8 percent from the April 5 price
of $1.9196 a pound, the highest since at least January 2004.  Hog futures for December settlement climbed 0.8 cent, or
0.9 percent, to settle at 89.225 cents a pound in  Chicago . The
commodity has gained 12 percent this year.  “Hogs are on a pretty good run,” Dick Quiter, an account
executive at McFarland Commodities LLC, said in a telephone
interview from Chicago. “There must be some export business
still going on.”  Pork imports by  China , the world’s largest consumer, may
rise to 480,000 metric tons in 2012 from an estimated 445,000
tons this year, “fueled by continued strong Chinese pork
demand,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s  Foreign
Agricultural Service  said in a  report  posted yesterday on its
website.  Yesterday, spot-market hog prices jumped 3.4 percent to
93.27 cents a pound, the biggest increase since June 21, USDA
data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement declined
0.175 cent, or 0.1 percent, to $1.41575 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
