The  International Monetary Fund  said
Romania will need to take more measures to narrow its  budget
deficit  below 3 percent of gross domestic product next
year, according to a report published on its website.  The eastern European country will require an “adjustment
of at least 0.5 percent of GDP” next year to cut its budget
deficit from a targeted shortfall of 4.4 percent of GDP this
year, the Washington-based institution said.  International market conditions might also “impede”
Romania’s asset-sale plan for this year and next and the
government might have to take alternative actions to improve
operations in its companies, the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
