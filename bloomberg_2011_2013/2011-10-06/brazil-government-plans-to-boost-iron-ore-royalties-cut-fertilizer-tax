Brazil  plans to cut its royalty rate
on fertilizers in half as part of a plan to overhaul mining
rules in the South American nation, Folha de S. Paulo reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The measure, which is almost ready for the government to
send to Congress, proposes cutting the rate on fertilizers to
1.5 percent from the current 3 percent, while raising the levy
on iron ore to 4 percent from 2 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
