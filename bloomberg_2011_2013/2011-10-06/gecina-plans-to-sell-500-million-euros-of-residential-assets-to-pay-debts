Gecina SA (GFC) , the French real-estate
investment company, said it will focus on asset sales in
residential property to help accelerate debt payments.  Gecina’s board plans to speed up the payments to creditors
by selling 500 million euros ($670 million) of residential real
estate assets, the Paris-based company said in a statement
today. Gecina said it plans to “rapidly achieve” 1.5 billion
euros of divestments and focus less on acquisitions of office
space.  In July, Gecina said profit fell 7.8 percent in the first
half because of higher borrowing costs. The company sold 559
million euros of property during the first six months of the
year, trimming net rental income by 14.4 million euros.  The company said Oct. 4 that Christophe Clamageran stepped
down as chief executive officer because of differences over
“the priorities for the implementation of Gecina’s strategy.”
Clamageran, who joined in November 2009, was replaced by Bernard Michel.  The company’s shares have fallen 19 percent this year,
giving it a market value of 4.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
