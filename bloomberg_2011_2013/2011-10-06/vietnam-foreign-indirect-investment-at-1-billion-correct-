(Corrects time period to September in first graph)  Foreign indirect investment into
 Vietnam ’s stock market and through purchases of stakes in
Vietnamese companies in the January to September period totaled
$1 billion, according to a statement on the central bank’s
website dated yesterday.  Foreign indirect investment into Vietnam in the same period
last year was $940 million, according to the statement. That
figure does not include the government’s $1 billion overseas
