U.K. stocks gained for a third day
after a report showed employers in the U.S. added more jobs than
forecast last month, easing concern amid investors that the
economic recovery is faltering.  Commodities companies, whose profits are closely tied to
growth, led the advance, with  Rio Tinto  Group rising 1.2
percent.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY)  retreated more than 3 percent as Moody’s Investors
Service cut the ratings on their debt.  Premier Foods Plc (PFD)  plunged
42 percent after saying third-quarter results were
“significantly” below forecasts.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 12.14, or 0.2 percent, to 5,303.4
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has rallied 3.4
percent this week as investors speculated policy makers will
reach agreement to shield financial institutions from the
European debt crisis and as the  Bank of England  expanded its
bond-purchase program. The FTSE All-Share Index added 0.3
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rallied 0.5 percent.  “This is a brief respite for equity markets,” said Chris Purdy, a trader at SpreadEx Ltd., in  St. Albans ,  England . “It
has provided a solid rally to end what has been a week of
unsteady gains. However, once equity investors quit looking at
this situation through a monthly employment microscope, they
will realize that the bigger picture is still pretty dismal.”  U.S. Jobs  U.S. payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised
57,000 increase the prior month that was more than originally
estimated, Labor Department data showed. The median forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise of 60,000. The gain
reflected the return to work of 45,000 telecommunications
employees. The jobless rate held at 9.1 percent.  The slump in stocks last month dragged the price-earnings
ratio on the FTSE 100 to 8.9 times the estimated profits of its
constituent companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with the average multiple of 11.4 during the past
five years, the data show.  “Current equity valuations are consistent with a material
strengthening in equity returns over the medium to longer
term,” Darren Winder, an equity strategist at Oriel Securities
in London, wrote in a report. “The outlook for profits is, in
our view, considerably more favorable than implied by current
valuations.”  The FTSE 100 slumped 14 percent in the third quarter, its
biggest drop since 2002, amid concern  Greece ’s debt woes will
spread to other countries in the region and that the global
economy is stalling.  Rio Tinto Drops  Rio Tinto, the world’s second-largest mining company,
advanced 1.2 percent to 3,164 pence.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , the
largest copper producer in  India , jumped 4.2 percent to 1,160
pence.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  increased 2.7 percent to 910 pence. Copper,
lead and tin rose in London.  RBS, the U.K.’s biggest government-controlled bank, fell 3
percent to 23.62 pence and Lloyds retreated 3.4 percent to 34.66
pence. Lloyds TSB Bank Plc, Santander UK Plc and Co-Operative
Bank Plc had their ratings lowered one step by Moody’s, while
RBS and  Nationwide Building Society  were cut two levels.  Premier Foods, the U.K.’s biggest food maker, tumbled 42
percent to 5.8 pence, the largest decline since its initial
share sale in 2004. Third-quarter earnings were “significantly
below” management forecasts, with sales falling 3.6 percent
during the period, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
