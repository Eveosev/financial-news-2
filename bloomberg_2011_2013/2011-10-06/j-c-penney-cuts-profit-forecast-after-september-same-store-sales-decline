J.C. Penney Co., the department-store
operator part owned by investor  Bill Ackman , decreased its
third-quarter profit forecast after September store sales
slumped.  Profit excluding some items will be as much as 15 cents a
share in the third quarter, the Plano, Texas-based retailer said
in a statement today. Previously, the company forecast earnings
of as much as 25 cents. Analysts expected 19 cents a share, the
average of three estimates.  J.C. Penney earlier this week named former  Target Corp. (TGT) 
executive Michael R. Francis president to focus on marketing and
planning as the company redefines a chain that had three
straight annual sales declines before a gain of 1.2 percent in
its fiscal 2011.  Sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.6 percent in
September, the company said. The average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Retail Metrics was for a gain of 0.9 percent. Same-,
or comparable-store sales are considered a key indicator of a
retailerâ€™s growth because new and closed sites are excluded.  J.C. Penney is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings
before the market opens on Nov. 14.  J.C. Penney rose 78 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $28.42 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have dropped 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
