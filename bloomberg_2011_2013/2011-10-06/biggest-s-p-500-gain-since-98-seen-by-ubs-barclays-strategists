Wall Street strategists say the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after falling within 1 percent of a
 bear market  this week, will post the biggest fourth-quarter
rally in 13 years even after they cut forecasts at a rate
exceeded only during the credit crisis.  The benchmark index for U.S. stocks will climb 14 percent
from yesterday to end 2011 at 1,300, according to the average
estimate of 12 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. The last time
they were this bullish in October was 2008, when the group
predicted a 27 percent gain and the index lost 18 percent.  Analysts from Oppenheimer & Co. to UBS AG and Barclays Plc
say equities will rebound from a decline of 19 percent since
April as policy makers prevent a default by  Greece  and profit in
the S&P 500 climb to $95.85 a share in 2011. Europe’s worsening
debt crisis and the U.S. government’s loss of its AAA  credit
rating  led strategists to cut their S&P 500 forecast in the past
two months from an average level of 1,401.  “Investors are way too bearish and are being swayed by
macro variables,”  Brian Belski , the New York-based chief
investment strategist at Oppenheimer, wrote in an e-mail on Oct.
4. “Fundamentals drive stocks,” he said. “U.S. portfolios are
not positioned for a positive third-quarter earnings season.”  Services Expanded  A report showing U.S. services industries expanded faster
than economists predicted in September and speculation Europe
will contain losses tied to sovereign debt pushed the  S&P 500  up
1.8 percent to 1,144.03 yesterday. After falling to 1,074.77
intraday on Oct. 4, the index surged 6.4 percent through
yesterday. The S&P 500 rallied 1.8 percent to 1,164.97 today.  Belski is sticking to his forecast from December that the
S&P 500 will end this year at 1,325, up 16 percent from
yesterday’s closing level. When he gave his prediction, the
average strategist projection for the end of 2011 was 1,379,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Strategists shouldn’t be so optimistic given the severity
of the European debt crisis, said Eric Teal, chief investment
officer at First Citizens Bancshares Inc., which manages $4
billion in Raleigh,  North Carolina .  “The best case is we establish a foundation with some
modest gains in the fourth quarter, but it’s too optimistic” to
expect a rally, he said. Strategists “need to better assess the
European debt situation,” Teal said in a telephone interview
yesterday. “The general trend is downward.”  Kostin Cuts Estimates  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s  David Kostin  cut his price
estimate for the S&P 500 in 2011 this week for the third time in
three months, reducing it to 1,200 from 1,250. While the U.S.
will likely avoid a recession, the economic recovery is
stagnating, according to the equity strategist.  “The unstable macro environment is likely to persist for
the foreseeable future,” Kostin wrote in an Oct. 4 report.
“Investors believe a non-trivial probability exists that the
crisis will trigger a global financial dislocation similar to
2008.”  Wall Street firms stuck with bullish forecasts through the
beginning of August as the S&P 500 tumbled amid concern U.S.
lawmakers would fail to reach an agreement with President  Barack Obama  to raise the nation’s debt limit. The index fell 11
percent between July 22 and Aug. 5.  Strategists kept their average forecast at 1,401 from July
6 through Aug. 8, when it was cut to 1,389. The measure
retreated to an 11-month low of 1,119.46 on Aug. 8 after S&P cut
the American credit rating.  Solving Greece  Stocks will rebound as investors become convinced leaders
in Europe can solve the sovereign crisis, according to UBS’s
 Jonathan Golub . The cost to rescue Europe’s banks may reach $2
trillion for governments and private partners,  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink said
yesterday at an event in Toronto.  “Worst-case outcomes are not going to play through,”
Golub said in a telephone interview on Oct. 4. “You have 17
countries that have to coordinate their actions, which makes the
process more cumbersome, but that doesn’t mean they can’t come
to a resolution.”  Golub said in December that the S&P 500 would end this year
at 1,325. He raised the estimate to 1,425 in February before
cutting it to 1,350 last month, an 18 percent rise from
yesterday’s closing level. Golub said in 2010 the S&P 500 would
finish the year at 1,350 before reducing that estimate to 1,150
in July. The gauge rallied 13 percent to 1,257.64 last year.  Russia  Default  The  stock index  jumped 21 percent in the fourth quarter of
1998 after Russia’s default, which caused the collapse of hedge
fund Long-Term Capital Management and sent the S&P 500 down 15
percent in August. The measure slumped 12 percent in August and
September of this year.  Global equities entered a bear market on Sept. 22, after
the MSCI All-Country World Index extended its drop since its
peak this year to more than 20 percent. About $3 trillion has
been erased from U.S. equities since April 29, sending the S&P
500’s valuation to 12.5 times earnings, near the lowest level
since March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While investors are abandoning stocks amid concern  Europe ’s
crisis will worsen and growth in  Asia  will slow, equities will
rally in the fourth quarter as economic and policy outlooks
improve and the  Federal Reserve  provides additional stimulus,
according to Barclays’s Barry Knapp. The central bank announced
plans on Sept. 21 to buy $400 billion of long-term debt.  Knapp estimates the S&P 500 will rise to 1,325 in 2011. He
lowered his prediction from 1,450 a month ago.  “The U.S. situation looks fine,” Knapp, the New York-
based head of U.S. equity strategy, said in a telephone
interview on Oct. 4. “If we were living in isolation here, the
market would be much higher.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
