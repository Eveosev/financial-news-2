Analysts discuss the  European Central
Bank ’s decision to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged
at 1.5 percent.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the ECB will resume
covered-bond purchases and reintroduce year-long loans for banks
to counter the debt crisis.  The comments were made in telephone interviews and in
client notes today:  Niels Christensen , chief currency strategist at Nordea Bank
AB in Copenhagen:  “It’s not a complete surprise, although some people were
looking for a possible cut.”  “Having hiked twice this year already, it’s a bit
difficult for them to start easing so soon.  “Eventually they will cut rates; probably late this year
and then in the spring of next year.  “We’re negative on the euro and see it going down to about
$1.20 in 12 months.”  John Hardy , head of foreign-exchange strategy at Saxo Bank
A/S in London:  “It was always unlikely that they’d move lower given that
their last hike was so recent.  “Trichet is ‘Mr. Vigilance,’ so reversing policy so soon
would be like admitting he was wrong.  “The market still has a couple of cuts priced in over the
next 12 months and I’d concur with that.  “It’ll be interesting to see the extent of the ECB’s
covered bond purchases and whether they move to de facto QE.”  Julian Callow, chief European economist at  Barclays Capital 
in London:  “We still expect the ECB to ease policy given the
impending recession risks in the euro area, but we must reckon
with that adjustment coming later rather than being more pre-
emptive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
