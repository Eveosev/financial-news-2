A measure of banks’ reluctance to
lend to one another in  Europe  declined to the lowest since Sept.
2, according to a money markets indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, fell to 73 basis
points at 4:27 p.m. in London, from 82 yesterday. That compares
with 89 basis points on Sept. 23, when the measure was the
widest since March 2009.  The European Commission proposes “coordinated action to
recapitalize banks” and rid them of toxic assets, President
 Jose Barroso  said today. The European Central Bank left  interest
rates  unchanged at 1.5%, while the  Bank of England  bank expanded
its bond-purchase plan for the first time in almost two years.  A measure of how much European banks pay to fund in dollars
fell. The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, declined to 102 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate, from 110
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap was
112.5 basis points on Sept. 12, when the swap was the most
expensive since December 2008.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap was at 70 basis
points under Euribor, down from 72 yesterday. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Lenders increased overnight deposits at the  European
Central Bank  to the highest in more than a year. Banks parked
221 billion euros ($294 billion) at the Frankfurt-based ECB
yesterday, up from 213 billion euros on Oct. 3. That’s the
highest since July 2010 and compares with a year-to-date average
of 55 billion euros.  Loans in Euros  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- fell to 1.556 percent from 1.558
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor fell to 1.155 percent from
1.17 percent.  The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 20th day to 0.388 percent from 0.384 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 10, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was 38.8
basis points from 38.4 yesterday, the biggest gap since July
2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
