Sport’s top court ruled that Olympic
organizers can’t ban athletes guilty of doping from taking part
in the next Games because it amounts to double punishment.  The  International Olympic Committee  in 2008 moved to stop
those suspended for more than six months for a doping violation
from taking part in the next Games, even if their ban had ended.  Today, the Court of Arbitration for Sport found the IOC
decision “is invalid and unenforceable,” according to an e-
mailed  statement  from the Lausanne, Switzerland-based court.  The CAS decision means American 400-meter runner LaShawn
Merritt can participate in the London Games next year. He was
suspended for two years after testing positive for a banned
substance that the athlete says he consumed accidentally. The
ban was later reduced to 21 months.  The U.S. Olympic Committee challenged his suspension from
the Games, saying that it amounted to a three-year ban, which
was a double punishment. The Court agreed, saying the Olympics
can’t have their own suspension program outside the World Anti-
Doping Code, which the Olympic organizers adopted as part of
their own statutes.  CAS said the IOC should move to have the World Anti-Doping
Code amended to include the Olympic ban should the Games
organizers still want to implement the suspension rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
