Hungary has “mellowed” its view on
euro adoption, central bank President Andras Simor said.  “We have mellowed our views” and “we are more careful
about at what terms to adopt the euro,” Simor said in a speech
in  London  today. “But we are so closely integrated that it’s
not a question whether to adopt the euro.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
