The European Banking Authority hasn’t
received an official request to conduct additional bank stress
tests, while it is aware of discussions on the matter, a
spokeswoman for the agency said. The EBA is a technical body and
isn’t taking any position on whether further stress tests are
needed, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
