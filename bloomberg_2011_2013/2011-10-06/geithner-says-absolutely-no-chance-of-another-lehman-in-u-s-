U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said today that there is “absolutely” no chance of
another U.S. financial institution collapsing like Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.  Geithner, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee in
Washington, was asked about  Morgan Stanley (MS)  but did not mention
that company by name.  “The direct exposure of the U.S. financial system to the
countries under the most pressure in Europe is very modest.
Europe as a whole, though, is a big deal,” Geithner said. “Our
firms, and this is true across the largest institutions in the
United States, again are in a much stronger position if you look
at their capital levels, levels of leverage, how they’re
funded.”   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
