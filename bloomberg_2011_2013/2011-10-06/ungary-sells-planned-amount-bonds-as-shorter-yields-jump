Hungarian bond yields climbed to the
highest since January at an auction on speculation the central
bank may raise borrowing costs to defend the currency.  The state raised 20 billion forint ($90 million) in notes
maturing in 2014 at an average yield of 7.23 percent, the
highest since Jan. 13, and compared with 6.65 percent at the
last sale on Sept. 22, according to auction results from the
Debt Management Agency published on Bloomberg. The agency sold
11 billion forint of 2017 bonds at 7.52 percent, against 7.25
percent two weeks ago.  Traders in  interest-rate  derivatives raised bets on tighter
monetary conditions as the forint’s decline threatened to drive
up inflation and payments on foreign-currency loans. The forint
slid to as weak as 300.7 per euro yesterday, its weakest in 2
1/2 years, before recovering to 297.5 per euro as of 4:20 p.m.
today.  “An interest-rate increase has been priced in recently,”
Sandor Jobbagy, a Budapest-based economist at the CIB Bank Zrt.
unit of Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, said in a telephone interview after
the auction.  Forward-rate agreements fixing three-month interest in one
month surged to 6.49 percent two days ago, a two-year high, from
6.07 percent a month earlier. They fell to 6.38 percent today,
trading 27 basis points, or 0.27 percentage point, above the
three-month Budapest interbank offered rate.  Rate Risks  The National Bank of  Hungary  on Sept. 20 left its benchmark
two-week deposit rate unchanged for an eighth month. The
majority of policy makers considered that the deteriorating
global risk environment is preventing policy makers from cutting
the interest rate even as the inflation outlook may justify such
a move, according to minutes of the meeting.  “There are risks that further strong depreciation of the
currency and an increase of risk spreads could trigger a rate
hike,” Zoltan Arokszallasi, a Budapest-based fixed-income
analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a research report
today. “This is not currently our baseline scenario.”  Investors bid for 83 billion forint in debt at the auction,
compared with 122.5 billion forint two weeks ago. The agency
also sold 12 billion forint of 2022 notes at 7.94 percent, down
from 8.14 percent. The agency sold no additional debt at a
later, non-competitive tender.  Three-year bonds fell for the first day in three in the
secondary market, with yields rising five basis points to 7.300
percent. Yields on the 2017 debt fell for a third day, losing 12
basis points to 7.650 percent. On the 2022 notes, yields
retreated 12 basis points to 8.038 percent.  Budget Target Concern  Concern that Hungary won’t meet its budget targets also
drove up borrowing costs, Jobbagy said.  “Trends in the real economy would justify a rate cut,
while financial stability factors point to tightening,”
according to Jobbagy.  Hungary’s 2012 budget, which the government sent to
parliament last week, assumes growth in gross domestic product
of 1.5 percent, underlying a plan to cut the deficit to 2.5
percent of GDP from 4.2 percent last year. The Cabinet’s growth
projection may be too optimistic, according to economists
including Matyas Kovacs at Raiffeisen Bank International AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
