Dutch average house prices fell 1.1
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, Dutch
realtors association NVM said today in a statement on its
website.  NVM said third-quarter house sales rose 4 percent from the
same period a year earlier. NVM had forecast an increase of 10
percent after the government cut a transaction tax to 2 percent
from 6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
