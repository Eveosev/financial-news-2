European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said the ECB will continue to deliver  price
stability  under his successor  Mario Draghi .  “I think the central bank will continue to be totally
faithful to its mandate,” Trichet said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television in Berlin today, after the ECB kept its
benchmark  interest rate  at 1.5 percent. “We always do what we
judge necessary to deliver price stability.”  Trichet announced earlier today that the ECB will resume
its covered-bond program next month and offer banks loans of up
to 13 months to fight the crisis. The Frankfurt-based central
bank also committed to lend banks unlimited liquidity for up to
three months through the first half year of 2012.  “We took a very important decision on the non-standard
measures and we trusted that this was extremely important in the
present circumstances,” Trichet said. As regards the
government-bond plan “I only say that it’s” ongoing.  Trichet, who will step down as ECB president at the end of
the month, also called for a “fierce application” of the
reforms governments agreed on at a July 21 summit of leaders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
