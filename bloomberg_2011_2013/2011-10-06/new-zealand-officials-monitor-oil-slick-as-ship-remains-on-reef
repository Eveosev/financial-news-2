New Zealand  authorities are
monitoring an  oil slick  near a container ship that is caught on
a reef near the North Island port of Tauranga.  An observation flight over the area early today showed a
slick of thinly spread oil streaming about 2,000 meters in a
narrow strip from the ship,  Maritime New Zealand  said in a
statement on its website. Officials are conducting an on-water
assessment.  “The oil is very thin and it appears it is starting to
break up and disperse naturally,” Rob Service, from Maritime
New Zealand’s national response team, said in the statement.  The 236-meter (774-foot) long Rena struck the reef about 12
nautical miles off the coast early on Oct. 5, and remains stable
on the rocks. Two of the ship’s holds have flooded and the ship
has a slight list, although tanks containing  fuel oil  are
undamaged, Maritime New Zealand said.  Talks are under way with the captain, the ship’s owners and
salvage experts to assess how to move the ship off the reef, the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
