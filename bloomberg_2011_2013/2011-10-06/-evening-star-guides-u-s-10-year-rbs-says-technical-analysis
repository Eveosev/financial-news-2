An “evening star” trading pattern
indicates Treasury 10-year note yields are poised to rise after
the securities reached overbought levels this week, according to
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “As 10-year yields approached and went through 1.75
percent, it reinforces our range thinking that the bottom of the
range is 1.70 to 1.75 percent for the foreseeable future, unless
facts change or change significantly,” said  William O’Donnell ,
head U.S. government bond strategist at the bank’s RBS
Securities unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , in an interview.  The yield on the 10-year note dropped to 1.756 percent on
Oct. 3, the lowest since its record low on Sept. 23. It closed
at 1.82 percent the next day and 1.9 percent yesterday, which
formed an evening star pattern on a candle chart by a sharp drop
in yields on the first day, followed by a correction on the
second and third days.  “What this pattern indicates is that we could have a
deeper correction and the next level in 10-year yields may be
2.06 percent to 2.12 percent in the next two to three weeks,”
he said. “Buyers should be patient and wait for cheaper levels
than we see today, especially with supply next week.”  Yield Path  The yield on the 10-year note rose today to 1.97 percent,
the highest since Sept. 30. The yield touched a record low of
1.67 percent on Sept. 23. The Treasury Department plans to sell
$32 billion of three-year notes, $21 billion of 10-year debt and
$13 billion of 30-year bonds in auctions next week.  “There are signs as evidenced by this pattern in
particular that we got into deep overbought conditions and now
that’s being unwound,” O’Donnell said. “It indicates a shift
of power where the bulls had control on Monday; Tuesday was the
battle between the bulls and the bears, and Wednesday tells you
that the bears won.”  The risks to the forecast are further European financial
deterioration or weaker-than-forecast U.S. economic data,
O’Donnell said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
