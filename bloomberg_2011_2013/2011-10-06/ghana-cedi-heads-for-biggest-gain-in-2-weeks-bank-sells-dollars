Ghana ’s cedi headed for the biggest
gain in more than two weeks as the west African country’s
central bank sold the U.S. currency and demand for dollars by
importers eased.  The currency of the world’s second-largest cocoa producer
appreciated as much as 0.9 percent to 1.6035 per dollar before
trading 0.2 percent up at 1.615 per dollar as of 2:34 p.m. in
Accra, the capital. A close at this level would be the cedi’s
biggest increase since Sept. 19. The cedi reached 1.621 on Oct.
4, the weakest level since at least 1994, when Bloomberg started
compiling the data.  “The central bank sold dollars on Oct. 4 and yesterday, so
we are no longer seeing the rush for dollars as in the days
before,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the local unit of
Barclays Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview today.  The  Bank of Ghana  monitors the  currency market  daily and
provides addition supply when necessary, Collins Antwi,
assistant director at the central bank’s treasury department,
said in a telephone interview. He declined to say whether the
regulator had sold dollars today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
