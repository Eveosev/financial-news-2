Tokyo Electric Power Co. said a
worker at its wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant died today in
hospital after falling ill yesterday. The company said it was
unlikely the cause of death was related to radiation.  The male subcontractor, who was in his 50s, had been
working at the plant since August, Tokyo Electric spokeswoman
Chie Hosoda said by phone. His cumulative radiation dose was
2.02 millisieverts, she said.  The internationally recommended exposure for a member of
the public is 1 millisievert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
