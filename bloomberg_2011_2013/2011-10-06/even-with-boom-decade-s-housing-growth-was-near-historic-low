The biggest housing boom in the last
30 years was offset by the sharpest slump in a generation,
ensuring that the growth in residential units during the last
decade remained at lows not seen since the Great Depression, the
U.S.  Census Bureau  said today.  The number of homes, apartments and condominiums added in
the decade grew 15.9 million to 131.7 million, a 13.6 percent
growth rate. Almost 90 percent of the growth occurred between
2000 and 2007. There were 2.1 million housing starts in 2005.
Last year, there were 587,000, Census figures show.  “This is unprecedented,” said  Patrick Newport , an IHS
Global Insight economist in Boston. “We just overbuilt by far.
We’ve never seen anything like this.”  The growth rate was slightly higher than the 13.3 percent
registered between 1990 and 2000. It was less than half the 28.7
percent recorded during the 1980s, when the maturing baby boom
generation added 19.7 million homes, and barely half the 23.2
percent growth registered during the 1940s.  The nation’s rate of homeownership dropped to 65.1 percent,
down 1.1 percentage point from 66.2 percent in 2000. The Census
Bureau said it was the sharpest drop  since the 1930s . Even with
the drop, the percentage of homeowners was the second-highest
since the government began recording home ownership figures in
the 1890s, the government said.  Seven-County Cluster  Seven of the nation’s 3,142 counties accounted for 10
percent of the new housing units. Maricopa County,  Arizona ,
added 389,000 homes during the decade, followed by Harris
County,  Texas , which added 301,000, and  Clark County , Nevada,
which increased its count by 281,000. Some of those counties are
now mired in the housing crisis, with empty blocks of overbuilt
homes and no buyers.  Three U.S. counties doubled their housing stock. The number
of Sumter County homes in central  Florida  grew 110 percent.
Teton County, Idaho, boosted its number of homes by 108 percent,
and Kendall County,  Illinois , a Chicago suburb, grew by 107
percent.  The number of vacant homes grew almost one-third to 15
million, or 11.4 percent of all housing units, up from 10.4
million in 2000.  Some of the areas that were hardest hit by the nation’s
foreclosure crisis registered only small changes in the
percentage of homeowners and renters. The number of renters grew
in San Bernadino County,  California , to 37.4 percent from 35.5
percent. Maricopa, also hit hard, had its renter percentage
climb to 35.5 percent from 32.5 percent.  Lost Housing  Almost 500 counties lost  housing units . St. Bernard Parish,
 Louisiana , lost 37 percent, or 9,996 homes, after  Hurricane
Katrina  struck the  Gulf Coast  in 2005. Neighboring Orleans
County lost 25,195 homes, or 11.7 percent of its housing units.
McDowell County, West Virginia, formerly home to an integrated
mining operation for U.S. Steel, lost 2,260 homes, or 16.7
percent of its housing stock.  “It became a bubble because the government encouraged home
ownership,” Newport said. “And banks made it very easy to borrow
money.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
