Steve Jobs was a college dropout who
built computers in his parents’ garage in the mid-1970s with a
friend, Steve Wozniak.  They founded what is now  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in 1976 to sell their
creations. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, surpassed
Microsoft Corp. in 2010 to become the world’s most valuable
technology company.  A timeline of Jobs’s career follows:  Feb. 24, 1955: A boy is born in San Francisco to college
graduate students Joanne Carole Schieble and Syrian immigrant
Abdulfattah “John” Jandali. Jobs said in a 1997 New York Times
Magazine article that he wouldn’t talk about his biological
parents, citing privacy. He is adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs,
who name him Steven Paul Jobs and raise him in the suburbs of
 Mountain View  and Los Altos, California.  1972: Jobs graduates from Homestead High School, the Cupertino
school that is also the alma mater of Wozniak, his future
business partner. Jobs enrolls at  Reed College  in  Portland ,
 Oregon , and drops out after one semester. “The minute I dropped
out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t
interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked
interesting,” he said during a June 2005  commencement speech  at
 Stanford University .  1974: Jobs returns to California and works as a designer at
Atari Corp., the video-game company. He later travels to  India 
in search of spiritual enlightenment.  1975: Jobs and Wozniak hang out at Homebrew Computer Club, an
informal gathering of engineers and hobbyists who swap parts and
ideas. The two show off the Apple I and Apple II computers at
the club meetings, according to  an article  written by Wozniak.  April 1, 1976: Jobs, Wozniak and Ron Wayne found Apple. Wayne,
who worked with Jobs at Atari, gives up his 10 percent share of
Apple less than two weeks later.  April 16, 1977: Wozniak and Jobs introduce the Apple II, which
becomes one of the first successful personal computers.  May 1978: Jobs’ girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, gives birth to a
girl, Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Chrisann raises Lisa mainly on her own.
Jobs later reconciles with Lisa.  Dec. 12, 1980: Apple goes public at $22 a share. Adjusted for
splits since then, the initial public offering price is $2.75.
Apple closed yesterday at $378.25.  February 1982: Jobs, 26, is featured on the cover of Time under
the headline, “Striking It Rich, America’s Risk Takers.” He
appears on the  magazine’s cover  more than a half dozen times.  January 1983: Apple releases the Lisa, the first commercially
sold computer with a graphical user interface. The Lisa, with a
price tag of $9,995, is a commercial failure.  January 1984: Apple announces the new Macintosh computer with an
ad that airs only once, during the  Super Bowl . The ad shows a
woman throw a hammer at a giant screen as a voice reads, “On
January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh and you’ll
see why 1984 won’t be like ‘1984.’” The Mac, which sells for
$2,500, becomes the first commercially successful personal
computer to have a graphical user interface and mouse.  September 1985: After being stripped of responsibilities amid a
power struggle with Chief Executive Officer John Sculley and the
board, Jobs resigns as chairman. He tells the board: “I’ve been
thinking a lot and it’s time for me to get on with my life. It’s
obvious that I’ve got to do something. I’m 30 years old,”
according to Sculley’s book, “Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple.” Jobs
soon starts NeXT Computer Inc., which builds high-powered
educational computers.  February 1986: Jobs buys George Lucas’s computer-graphics shop
for $10 million and renames it Pixar Inc.  March 18, 1991: He marries Laurene Powell at a hotel in Yosemite
National Park. Their first child, Reed, is born in September,
followed by daughters Erin in 1995 and Eve in 1998.  February 1993: NeXT decides to stop making computer workstations
and lays off more than half of its 540 employees.  November 1995: Pixar releases its first feature film, “Toy
Story,” which grosses more than $360 million and is nominated
for three Oscars. In the same month, the company goes public.
Jobs would say in a 1998  BusinessWeek article , “I think Pixar
has the opportunity to be the next Disney -- not replace Disney
-- but be the next Disney.”  Dec. 20, 1996: Apple says it will buy NeXT for $400 million and
rehire Jobs as a consultant to help the company revamp its
flagship Macintosh software. The third-largest PC maker says it
will incorporate NeXT’s technology into the next version of the
Mac operating system. Apple was in such dire straits before the
return of Jobs that BusinessWeek in February ran a cover article
titled, “The Fall of an American Icon.”  July 9, 1997: After 17 months as Apple’s chairman and chief
executive officer, Gilbert Amelio is forced to resign. Jobs
later becomes interim CEO while Apple searches for a new leader.  Aug. 6, 1997: At the Macworld trade show in  Boston , Jobs
announces that longtime rival Microsoft Corp. will invest $150
million in Apple. Also, in a boardroom shake-up, Jobs and Oracle
Corp. CEO  Larry Ellison  are named as directors.  May 1998: Apple unveils the iMac, a $1,299 all-in-one PC encased
in a translucent, curvy box. It’s the first of many “i”
products, including the clamshell-shaped iBook that comes out
the next year.  Jan. 6, 1998: Jobs announces at Macworld that Apple has returned
to profitability after more than a year of losses, and the
shares jump 19 percent.  Jan. 5, 2000: After 2 1/2 years as interim CEO, Jobs officially
assumes the helm and receives a long, standing ovation at
Macworld. He shows off the Mac OS X operating system, which is
similar to the software he developed at NeXT. “Apple will be
one of the 10 most profitable Internet companies in the next 10
years,” Jobs tells the gathering.  Jan. 9, 2001: Jobs introduces the digital hub strategy at
Macworld, telling participants: “The PC is on the threshold of
entering the third great age,” with computers at the center and
devices that include cameras and music players. Apple’s next
focus will be audio, Jobs says as he unveils iTunes, a free
software program for organizing music. “We’re late to this
party, and we’re about to leapfrog,” he says.  May 2001: Apple opens retail stores to attract new customers.
The first are in McLean,  Virginia , and Glendale,  California . The
company eventually expands to more than 300 stores worldwide.  Oct. 23, 2001: Apple introduces the iPod, its first portable
digital-music player, a move beyond PCs as the industry heads
for its worst slump in more than a decade. The iPod stores as
many as 1,000 MP3-format songs and sells for $399.  April 28, 2003: Apple unveils the iTunes Music Store, which
offers more than 200,000 digital songs from the top five record
companies. “You’ll fall in love with music so much again that
you’ll spend some money,” Jobs says. ITunes sells about 1
million tracks in the first week.  October 2003: Jobs is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer
affecting the pancreas and tries to treat the illness by
switching to a special diet to avoid surgery, according to a
2008 article in Fortune magazine that cites people familiar with
the matter. Apple decided not to tell investors after consulting
lawyers, the magazine reports.  Aug. 1, 2004: Jobs, then 49, discloses the cancer for the first
time, saying he had successful surgery to extract a tumor and
won’t need chemotherapy or radiation. Chief Operating Officer
 Tim Cook  runs Apple until Jobs returns to work in September.  June 12, 2005: Jobs talks about his cancer during a commencement
speech at Stanford University, saying that he was diagnosed
about a year earlier and that doctors told him he wouldn’t live
longer than six months. The cancer turned out to be treatable
with surgery “and I’m fine now,” he says.  January 2006:  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  announces it will buy Pixar. The
$8.06 billion deal, completed in May, makes Jobs the largest
shareholder of Disney and a board member.  Oct. 4, 2006: Apple says Jobs knew the company backdated stock-
option grants to executives in some cases, though he didn’t
benefit or know of the accounting implications of the practice.
“I apologize to Apple’s shareholders and employees for these
problems, which happened on my watch,” Jobs says in a
statement. An internal probe later clears him of wrongdoing.  Jan. 9, 2007: Jobs takes the stage at Macworld to show off the
new iPhone and announces Apple is dropping “Computer” from its
name, highlighting its reliance on consumer electronics. Apple
shares close at a record high on optimism the iPhone will boost
sales by more than $1 billion. The device challenges Palm Inc.
and Research In Motion Ltd.’s multifunction phones.  June 9, 2008: Jobs, while introducing the iPhone 3G at Apple’s
developer conference, appears thinner and frail. The company
blames a “common bug.”  July 21, 2008: Responding to concerns about Jobs’s appearance,
Apple says that he has no plans to leave the company and that
his health is a private matter. Apple also forecasts sales and
profit that trail analysts’ estimates. The shares fall as much
as 12 percent the next day.  July 23, 2008: Jobs has been telling associates and Apple’s
board he is cancer-free, the New York Times reports. Jobs had a
surgical procedure earlier in the year to address a problem that
contributed to his  weight loss , the newspaper says, citing
people close to the executive.  Sept. 9, 2008: Jobs, introducing new iPod media players at an
event in  San Francisco , still looks thin. “Reports of my death
are greatly exaggerated,” he jokes.  Dec. 16, 2008: Apple says Jobs won’t give his usual speech at
the Macworld conference, to be held the next month. He had used
the forum to introduce new products for 11 straight years.  Jan. 5, 2009: Jobs says he has a hormone imbalance, causing him
to lose weight, and vows to remain CEO during treatment. “The
remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and
straightforward,” Jobs says in an open letter.  Jan. 14, 2009: He gives up day-to-day operations to Cook until
June, saying his health problems are more complex than
originally thought. He says he will remain involved in major
strategic decisions.  June 23, 2009: Methodist University Hospital Transplant
Institute in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , confirms that Jobs had a  liver
transplant  and has “an excellent prognosis.”  June 29, 2009: Apple announces Jobs’s return to work. At the
time, Apple shares had risen about 70 percent since Jan. 15.  Sept. 9, 2009: Jobs makes his first public appearance since his
return to work, introducing new iPod models in San Francisco. He
says he was the recipient of a liver transplanted from a young
adult who had died in a car crash.  Jan. 27, 2010: He introduces the iPad. Apple sells 7.3 million
of the tablet computers in their debut quarter.  Jan. 17, 2011: Jobs begins another medical leave, telling
employees in an e-mail that “I love Apple so much and hope to
be back as soon as I can.” Cook again takes charge of day-to-
day operations.  Feb. 23, 2011: Apple shareholders reject a proposal seeking more
disclosure about its executive succession plans.  March 2, 2011: Jobs, 56, emerges from medical leave to introduce
a new version of the iPad tablet. The appearance assures some
investors that he still participates in decision-making.  March 23, 2011: Disney investors re-elect Jobs to the board of
the entertainment company, rejecting calls from proxy advisers
who say health issues might impair his ability to serve.  April 11, 2011: CBS Corp.’s Simon & Schuster sets the
publication date for a Jobs biography for early 2012. The book
is written by Walter Isaacson and initially titled “iSteve: The
Book of Jobs.” The title is later changed to “ Steve Jobs ” and
the publication date moved up to November 2011.  Aug. 24, 2011: Jobs resigns as Apple CEO, handing the reins to
Cook and taking the title of chairman. “I have always said if
there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and
expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you
know,” Jobs says in a statement. “Unfortunately, that day has
come.”  Oct. 5, 2011: Apple announces the death of Steve Jobs, saying
his “brilliance, passion and energy were the source of
countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our
lives.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
