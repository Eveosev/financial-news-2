Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak
and his wife won’t be required to testify in the sodomy trial of
the country’s opposition leader, who has accused the couple of
trying to frame him for political reasons.  Lawyers for opposition chief  Anwar Ibrahim  failed to show
the “relevancy” of forcing Najib and his spouse to give
testimony, Judge Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah said in a court in
Kuala Lumpur today.  Malaysia ’s  High Court  ruled on Aug. 8 that Anwar’s lawyers
could interview Najib and the defendant had sought to subpoena
the prime minister and his wife, Rosmah Mansor.  Anwar faces as much as 20 years in prison if convicted of
sodomizing a former aide and the outcome may determine the
future of his People’s Alliance coalition as well as whether he
can run in the next general elections, which must be called by
early 2013. Najib has denied Anwar’s accusation that he played a
role in having him framed.  Sodomy, defined as “carnal intercourse against the order
of nature,” is illegal in Malaysia even if the act is between
two consenting men.  To contact the reporter on this story:
