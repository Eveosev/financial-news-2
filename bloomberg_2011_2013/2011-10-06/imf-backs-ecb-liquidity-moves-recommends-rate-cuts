The  International Monetary Fund 
supports steps by the  European Central Bank  to expand liquidity
while recommending consideration of more  interest rate  cuts by
the central bank, IMF spokesman  David Hawley  said.  The Frankfurt-based ECB today said it will resume covered-
bond purchases and reintroduce year-long loans for banks as the
sovereign debt crisis threatens to lock money markets. Policy
makers left the benchmark interest rate at 1.5 percent.  “We share the ECB’s concern that there are severe downside
risks to the outlook as the result of financial tensions and
thus we fully support the liquidity extension announced today,”
Hawley told reporters in  Washington  today.  “With the outlook risks persisting we believe there is
currently scope for a reduction in policy rates as well,” he
said.  An IMF mission in  Greece  to assess whether the country
should receive the latest tranche of a 110-billion euros ($170
billion) loan with the European Union should conclude “in a few
days,” Hawley said. He declined to give a date for when the IMF
board may meet to authorize any payment.  Asked about Egypt, Hawley said the IMF is “in close
dialogue with the authorities” and an IMF team will travel to
Cairo “in the next few weeks to take stock of development in
the economy,” he said.  Egypt has not requested financial assistance, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
