Consumer prices in Ecuador, which
uses the  U.S. dollar  as its official currency, rose at their
fastest pace in more than two years in September as food costs
jumped, the National Statistics and Census Institute said.  Prices climbed 5.39 percent from a year earlier, the
steepest 12-month increase since May 2009, and rose 0.79 percent
from August, the agency said today in a report on its  website .
Producer prices rose 0.14 percent month-over-month and gained
6.73 percent in the year.  Ecuador’s economy, South America’s seventh-biggest,
expanded 8.9 percent in the second quarter, its fastest pace
since 2008, as windfall oil profits helped boost spending on
labor-intensive public works projects and spurred consumer
demand, central bank President  Diego Borja  said last week.  Prices rose the fastest in the highland city of Ambato,
jumping 7.48 percent in September from the previous year, while
inflation reached 5.69 percent in the nation’s largest city,
Guayaquil, the statistics agency said.  Ecuador , the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ smallest member, subsidizes
fuel and domestic use of natural gas.  Food costs leaped 8.57 percent, led by potatoes, a staple
in the Andean nation, which soared 22 percent from a year
earlier, while eggs increased 10 percent, the report said.
Education costs rose 5.76 percent in September as highland
schools restarted classes after a summer recess.  Ecuador’s Finance Ministry raised its inflation forecast in
August to 4.13 percent from the earlier estimate of 3.69
percent, while the central bank said Sept. 29 that the economy
will expand faster than its previous estimate of 5.24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
