Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ) , former owner
of the biggest U.S. bank to fail, must try to settle differences
among shareholders,  hedge funds  and other creditors before
making its third attempt to exit bankruptcy, a judge said.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath rejected Seattle-based
WaMu’s proposal to limit mediation so the company could try to
quickly end its three-year-old bankruptcy and distribute $7
billion to creditors. She set a Nov. 7 deadline for a yet-to-be
named mediator to report on whether mediation has succeeded, has
failed or needs more time.  “I am not going to have another contested confirmation
without trying,” Walrath said at a hearing today in Wilmington,
Delaware. She has twice rejected WaMu’s reorganization proposal
after holding multiday confirmation hearings involving dozens of
lawyers and witnesses arguing about the fairest way to
distribute the money.  WaMu filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 26, 2008, the day after
its banking unit was taken over by regulators and sold to
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  for $1.9 billion. Washington Mutual Bank
had more than 2,200 branches and $188 billion in deposits.  The case is In re Washington Mutual Inc., 08-12229,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
