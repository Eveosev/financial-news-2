(Corrects spelling of name in sixth paragraph.)  The  Swiss National Bank  may have
spent 10 billion ($11.9 billion) or 11 billion francs on euro
purchases last month to curb the local currency’s strength,
according to estimates by Nomura International Plc and UBS AG.  Switzerland’s central bank said today its foreign-currency
holdings rose to a record 282.4 billion francs at the end of
September from 253.4 billion francs the prior month. The data
included changes in foreign-currency swaps, masking the increase
in foreign-exchange holdings resulting from franc sales. The SNB
imposed a ceiling on the franc at 1.20 per euro on Sept. 6.  “We estimate, extracting from valuation effects, they
bought around 11 billion francs worth of euros,”  Geoff Kendrick , the European head of currency strategy at Nomura,
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  The figure was derived from Nomura’s spreadsheet which has
the share of reserves by currency, Kendrick said. The
calculation was based on an assumption that the percentage of
euros in the reserves remained unchanged from the second quarter
at 55 percent, he said.  UBS,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, estimated the SNB sold 10
billion francs to buy euros last month.  “Combining the latest officially announced currency
allocation across holdings by the SNB for Q2 with the latest
price action in the respective franc crosses, the data suggest
an extra increase of foreign currency holdings in the
whereabouts of 10 billion francs,” wrote Reto Huenerwadel, a
senior economist at UBS in Zurich. “This is roughly the amount
that could be attributed to foreign-currency intervention.”  The franc weakened 4.8 percent against the euro in September
after rising 5.7 percent in the first eight months of 2011. It
fell 0.3 percent to 1.2362 per euro at 4:53 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
