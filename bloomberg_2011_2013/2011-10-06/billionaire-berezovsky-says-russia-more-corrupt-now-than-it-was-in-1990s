Boris Berezovsky , the Russian
billionaire living in exile in the U.K., told a London court
today  Russia  is more corrupt now than it was in the 1990s.  “Definitely there was corruption in Russia, much less than
now,” he said when testifying in his $5.56 billion lawsuit
against former business partner  Roman Abramovich . He described
corruption in the country during the 1990s as a “three out of
10,” compared with 10 out of 10 now.  The London court case has shed light on the business
dealings of two of the world’s richest men, and the chaotic
conditions in Russia in the 1990s which allowed a handful of
well-connected businessmen to gain control of state assets.  Berezovsky claims Abramovich intimidated him into selling
his shares in Russian oil company OAO Sibneft and aluminum
producer United Co. Rusal for less than they were worth.
Berezovsky says Abramovich told him the Russian state would
expropriate the shares if he didn’t sell. He says he lost at
least $5.56 billion in the two deals in 2000 and 2004.  Abramovich, who owns London soccer club Chelsea, claims
Berezovsky had no stake in the companies and his role was purely
as a “power broker,” who used his political influence to set up
backroom business deals.  Both men have been present in court with their attendants
and bodyguards since the 16-day trial started this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
