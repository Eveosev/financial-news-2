Open Range Communications Inc.,
formed to provide high-speed wireless Internet service to rural
communities in 17 states, sought bankruptcy protection from
creditors after failing to retain funding and bandwidth.  The Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company won approval
in 2009 for a $267 million U.S. Department of Agriculture loan
for rural utilities development. An arm of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
also invested $100 million in the company, Open Range said.  “The company’s momentum was, however, substantially
adversely affected” by a contractor’s wireless-spectrum
problems and the USDA loan was withdrawn, Chief Financial
Officer Chris Edwards said in a filing today in  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in Wilmington, Delaware.  Open Range said it will either sell its network or shut
down and liquidate. The company listed assets of about
$114 million and liabilities of about $110 million in today’s
Chapter 11 filing. Open Range had an operating loss of
$50.4 million last year on sales of $1.7 million.  The company’s largest unsecured creditors include Adesta
LLC of Omaha, Nebraska, owed $7.57 million, and Velocitel Inc.
of Cary,  North Carolina , owed $5.59 million, both in trade debt.
JPMorgan Chase’s One Equity Partners, based in  New York , has a
claim for $2.78 million in management fees.  The case is In re Open Range Communications Inc., 11-13188,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
