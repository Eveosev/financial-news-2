U.K. stocks completed the biggest
two-day gain since 2008 as the Bank of England expanded its
bond-purchase plan and investors speculated European Union
policy makers will contain the region’s debt crisis.  SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-biggest brewer, jumped
the most in almost three years after Brazilian website IG
reported Anheuser-Busch InBev NV may buy the British-South
African brewer for $80 billion. Mining companies Rio Tinto
Group, Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. and  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  all
climbed at least 7 percent.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  rose more than 8 percent.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  advanced 189.9, or 3.7 percent, to
5,291.26 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , extending yesterday’s
3.2 percent climb for the largest two-day increase since
December 2008. The gauge lost 14 percent in the third quarter,
its biggest drop since 2002, amid concern  Greece ’s debt woes
will spread to other countries in the region and that the global
economy is stalling.  “The move from the BOE will alleviate some of the downside
risk to growth by spurring some lending,” said Graham Bishop, a
European equity strategist at the Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc.  The broader FTSE All-Share Index advanced 3.6 percent
today, and Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 2.8 percent.  Shares in London extended gains as the  Bank of England 
pledged to buy the most bonds since the depths of the last
financial crisis.  BOE Stimulus  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee raised the
ceiling for so-called quantitative easing to 275 billion pounds
($421 billion) from 200 billion pounds. That’s the biggest
expansion since the first round of stimulus in March 2009. Only
11 of 32 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted an
increase in asset purchases.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet ,
fronting a policy decision for the final time, said the bank
will resume covered-bond purchases and reintroduce year-long
loans for banks as the sovereign debt crisis threatens to lock
money markets.  The ECB will spend 40 billion euros ($53 billion) on
covered bonds starting next month and will offer banks two
additional unlimited loans of 12 and 13-month durations, Trichet
said at a press conference in Berlin after policy makers
left the benchmark  interest rate   at 1.5 percent.  SABMiller Report  SABMiller shares surged 7 percent to 2,247.5 pence, the
biggest advance since November 2008, as IG reported that the
company is in talks to be bought by AB InBev, the world’s
largest brewer.  Guilherme Barros, a columnist at the Sao Paulo-based
website, said a deal could be worth about $80 billion. He didn’t
say how he obtained the information. Spokespeople for the two
brewers declined to comment on the report.  Rio Tinto  advanced 7.6 percent to 3,126.5 pence and ENRC
gained 9.7 percent to 611.5 pence, the largest increase since
April 2009. Kazakhmys surged 8.3 percent to 847.5 pence. A gauge
of basis resources shares in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index was the
best performer among 19 industry groups as copper, lead, nickel
and tin rallied in London.  U.K. banks advanced as German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
the euro area will only use its rescue fund as a last resort to
save banks and that investors may have to take deeper losses as
part of a Greek rescue.  Banks Gain  Standard Chartered rose 8.8 percent to 1,325 pence and
Lloyds increased 8.7 percent to 35.87 pence.  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
climbed 8 percent to 167.85 pence.  “Markets are beginning to believe in European policy
makers,” said Henrik Drusebjerg, a senior strategist at Nordea
Bank AB in Copenhagen. “If the crisis is solved, there’s so
much bad news priced into shares that people are now buying
because they’re afraid to be left behind if the rally comes.”  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  advanced 4.6 percent to 347 pence after saying
it will open two new bases in France next year, strengthening
its challenge to the nation’s flagship carrier, Air France-KLM
Group. Separately, EasyJet was upgraded to “outperform” from
“neutral” at Credit Suisse Group AG.  Mouchel Group Plc (MCHL)  slumped 34 percent to 20.5 pence, the
biggest drop on record. The provider of highway maintenance
services said Chief Executive Officer Richard Cuthbert resigned
after an accounting error wiped out 4.3 million pounds of profit
from a contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
