David Beckham ’s earning power is
climbing in his soccer career’s twilight.  The 36-year-old former England captain paid himself an
extra 2.6 million pounds ($4 million) last year from new
endorsement deals, according to a filing today by his London-
based company, Footwork Productions Ltd. He endorses  Adidas AG (ADS) 
and PepsiCo Inc. among other companies.  Beckham’s total 2010 earnings from the company, which
doesn’t include his Los Angeles Galaxy salary, rose 31 percent
to 14.9 million pounds, the filing shows. Forbes magazine in May
put his total earnings at $40 million.  It’s the highest revenue for Beckham’s company since 2005,
when he played for Real Madrid.  His five-year contract with the Galaxy ends in November
and, according to L’Equipe newspaper, Paris Saint-Germain is
among teams that want to sign him.  Beckham is also in-demand among companies seeking to
promote their brand at next year’s London Olympics. In May, he
agreed to become Samsung Electronics Co.’s global brand
ambassador for the Games.  To contact the reporters on this story:
