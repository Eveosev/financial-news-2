The U.S. from the Southwest to the
Northeast will be warmer than normal through next week,
according to forecasters.  Above-average temperatures will take hold from southern
 California  across the U.S. to New England and the Canadian
Maritimes, according to 6- to 10-day forecasts from  MDA EarthSat
Weather  and  Commodity Weather Group LLC .  Temperatures are expected to range least 3 to 8 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.6 to 4.4 Celsius) higher than normal, according to
the forecasts for Oct. 11 to Oct. 15.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants use
about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  The biggest variable in next week’s forecast will be what
happens with a storm expected to come out of the  Gulf of Mexico ,
said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather in Bethesda,
 Maryland .  If it combines with another system moving south from
 Canada , the U.S. East Coast may be cooler because of the rain
and clouds.  In the 11- to 15-day outlook for Oct. 16 to Oct. 20, both
forecasters call for warming in the central and eastern U.S.
Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MDA predicts the highest
temperatures will spread across the southern Great Plains and
into the Ohio Valley, while Rogers sees the warmest weather in
central Great Plains and northern Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
