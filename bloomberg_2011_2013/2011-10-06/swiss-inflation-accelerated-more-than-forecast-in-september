Swiss inflation accelerated more than
economists forecast in September, led by higher costs for
clothing and shoes as well as energy.  Consumer prices increased 0.5 percent from a year earlier
after rising 0.2 percent in August, the  Federal Statistics
Office  in Neuchatel said in an e-mailed statement today.
Economists forecast prices to rise an annual 0.3 percent, the
median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The Swiss franc’s 8.4 percent gain versus the euro over the
past year and a global slowdown are curbing price pressures,
leaving households with more money to spend just as the recovery
falters. The Swiss central bank last month introduced a franc
cap of 1.20 against the euro to fight deflation threats and
President Philipp Hildebrand on Sept. 29 said economic growth
will cool in the current half.  Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent from August. Costs of
clothing and shoes jumped 8.7 percent from a year earlier, while
oil products were 9.8 percent more expensive, today’s report
showed. Prices of imported goods rose 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
