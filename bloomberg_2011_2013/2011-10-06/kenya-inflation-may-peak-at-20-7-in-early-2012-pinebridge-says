Inflation in  Kenya ,  East Africa ’s
biggest economy, may peak at 20.7 percent in the first quarter
of next year, while economic growth will likely slow, Edward
Gitahi, senior investment manager at PineBridge Investments LLC,
said.  The  fund manager  lowered its inflation forecast from 23.5
percent after the central bank increased  interest rates  and food
prices fell, Gitahi told reporters today in the capital,
Nairobi. The economy will probably expand 3.5 percent in 2011,
down from a previous estimate of 4.5 percent, he said.  PineBridge’s East Africa unit had $1.1 billion of assets
under management at March 31, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
