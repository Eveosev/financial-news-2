Poland ’s WIG20 Index advanced for a
second day, adding 28.40, or 1.3 percent, to 2,173.27 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, rose
0.64 zloty, or 2 percent, to 32.93 zloty, its second day of
gains. PZU SA (PZU PW), the country’s largest insurer, climbed
3.8 zloty, or 1.3 percent, to 302.8 zloty. Financial shares
extended gains in  Europe  on continuing speculation that Europe’s
leaders will reach an agreement to contain the sovereign-debt
crisis.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, jumped 8 zloty, or 6.6 percent, to
129.4 zloty, extending yesterday’s 3.3 percent increase. Copper
advanced as better-than-expected U.S. economic data and
speculation that Europe will contain the region’s debt crisis
boosted demand for industrial metals.  TVN SA (TVN)   rose 0.16 zloty, or 1.1 percent, to 15.34
zloty, the highest close in two months. ITI Holdings SA will
next week pick one bidder to hold exclusive talks on the sale of
its majority stake in Poland’s largest television network,
 Gazeta Wyborcza  reported, citing three unidentified people.
Vivendi SA and Time Warner Inc. are bidding to buy TVN after RTL
Group SA withdrew, the Warsaw-based newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
