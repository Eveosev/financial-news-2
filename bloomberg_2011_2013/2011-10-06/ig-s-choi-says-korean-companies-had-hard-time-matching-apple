Choi Do Yeon, an analyst at LIG
Investment & Securities Co., comments on South Korean technology
companies after  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  announced co-founder and former Chief
Executive Officer  Steve Jobs  died.  On Apple:  “Jobs was all about creativity, and he created devices
that people desire to buy. Even without Jobs as the CEO, people
thought he would have a direct and indirect impact on the
management, and the company would keep showing its ability to
develop new devices.  ‘‘His death might weaken such ability.’’  On Korean companies:  ‘‘Apple’s iPhone has entirely changed the technology
industry landscape. Some of its Korean rivals had a hard time
keeping up with Apple.  ‘‘I cautiously think it could be a chance for Korean
companies to regain some of the leadership they lost to Apple.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
