A research reactor operated by the
Japan Atomic Energy Agency was shaken beyond its design limits
during the earthquake that struck in March and another of the
agency’s nuclear facilities was likely damaged in the disaster.  The Japan Research Reactor No. 3 in Tokai village, 115
kilometers (71 miles) northeast of  Tokyo , was shaken as much as
5.7 times more than its design allowed, the Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology  said  in a
statement.  Parts of the roof of the experimental Japan Materials
Testing Reactor building in the agency’s research center in
Oarari, 60 kilometers from Tokyo, was damaged, possibly by the
quake, the ministry said. No radiation leaks were found at
either site, according to the ministry.  The magnitude-9 quake and subsequent tsunami on March 11
knocked out power and cooling at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, causing the worst nuclear accident
since Chernobyl 25 years ago.  Neither of the Japan Atomic reactors were running when the
quake hit, said Kunimi Yoshida, an official involved in nuclear
power regulation at the science ministry.  Tokai village was the site of an accident in 1999 at a
nuclear plant operated by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.’s unit JCO
Co. Two workers were killed by radiation after pouring uranium
from a bucket into a processing tank, leading to a chain
reaction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
