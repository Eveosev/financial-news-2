Russia ’s food safety watchdog
canceled the Ninth Piggy Olympiad because of the African Swine
Fever risks, Tatyana Kolchanova, vice president of the country’s
 Sports Pig-Breeding Federation  said.  The race with 12 trained pigs at the Golden Autumn
agricultural exhibition in Moscow on Oct. 14-16 will not be
held, Kolchanova said by phone today.  The service, known as Rosselkhoznadzor, banned the event
and any kind of hog demonstration at the exhibition “because of
the direct threat of ASF expansion on territory of the Russian
Federation,” according to the order published on the service’s
website yesterday.  ASF is a virus that kills pigs and for which there is no
vaccine. The disease, which is harmless to people, killed 20,000
pigs in southern Russia in the first half of the year, according
to Rosselkhoznadzor data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
