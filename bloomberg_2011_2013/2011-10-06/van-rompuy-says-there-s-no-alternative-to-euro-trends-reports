The euro will survive the sovereign-
debt crisis because there is “no alternative,” European Union
President  Herman Van Rompuy  said in an interview with  Trends .  “We stand probably before the most difficult phase in the
history of the euro,” the magazine quoted  Van Rompuy  as saying.
“If you ask me if we are going to work it out, I say ‘yes’
because neither an individual country nor the euro zone as a
whole have an interest in letting the euro fall. There is just
no alternative,” he told Trends.  “We sit in a dangerous phase,” Van Rompuy said in the
interview. “We have to guarantee the financial stability of the
euro area, not just because it’s in our own interest but also in
order not to throw the world economy into a recession or
depression. Therefore the whole world is looking to us,” he was
quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
