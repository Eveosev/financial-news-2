Belarus’s most profitable company in
the second quarter was fertilizer maker Belaruskali,  which
produces 15 percent of the world’s potash, according to the
 Finance Ministry .  Belaruskali had a profit of 2.5 trillion rubles ($436
million) in the period, a 14-fold increase from the previous
three months, the ministry said in a  report  on its website
today. The Mozyr refinery was the former Soviet republic’s least
profitable company with a net loss of 190 billion rubles.  President Aleksandr Lukashenko, who has considered selling
a stake in state-owned Belaruskali as part of the country’s
asset sale program, values the company at $30 billion.  The domestic currency was devalued by 36 percent in May and
a further 38 percent last month after the authorities allowed
the ruble to trade freely.  To contact the reporter on this story:
