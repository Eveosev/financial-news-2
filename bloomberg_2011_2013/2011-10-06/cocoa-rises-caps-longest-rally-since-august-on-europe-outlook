Cocoa futures rose, capping the
longest rally since late August, on speculation that  Europe  will
control the region’s debt crisis, preserving economic growth to
fuel demand for commodities.  The  European Central Bank  may protect banks from the
fallout of a potential Greek default, ECB President  Jean-Claude
Trichet  said today. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw
materials rose for the second straight day after touching a 10-
month low on Oct. 4. Cocoa tumbled 16 percent last month.  “If you get any kind of stabilization in global markets,
you’re going to see demand improve for basic commodities,
including cocoa,” Phil Streible, a senior market strategist at
MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  Cocoa futures for December delivery rose $38, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $2,660 a metric ton at 12:02 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York , the biggest gain for a most-active
contract since Sept. 27 and the third straight increase. The
commodity has slumped 30 percent from a 32-year high of $3,775
on March 4.  The MSCI World Index of equities rose as much as 2.5
percent, and the dollar declined against a basket of major
currencies, increasing the investment appeal of commodities.  Cocoa’s rally was tied more to financial markets than any
“fundamental strength,” Spencer Patton, the chief investment
officer at Steel Vine Investments in  Chicago , said in a phone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
