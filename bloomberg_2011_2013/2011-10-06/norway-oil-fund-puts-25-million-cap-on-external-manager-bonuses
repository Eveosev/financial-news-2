Norway’s oil fund set an upper limit
of $25 million on annual bonuses it pays to external fund
managers to promote a longer-term investment strategy and after
receiving criticism in past years over excess payments.  The Government Pension Fund Global,  Europe ’s largest equity
investor, announced the cap in a  letter  to the  Finance Ministry 
in connection with today’s government budget.  The fund put in place an undisclosed cap in 2009 after it
paid bonuses of 530 million kroner ($91 million) to one manager
and 170 million kroner to another. Bonus amounts that exceed the
annual cap can be paid out in later years provided managers
continue to generate excess returns, Bunny Nooryani, a
spokeswoman at the fund, said by phone in Oslo.  “The system of keeping back part of the bonus will
contribute to supporting a long-term investment outlook,” the
government said in a today’s budget document. The rule went into
effect on Sept. 5.  The fund at the end of the second quarter had 199 billion
kroner of its stocks externally managed and overall 6.8 percent
of its assets were managed externally. The fund said earlier
this year in its annual report that it handed out 14 specialist
stock mandates in 2010, including in  Greece ,  Spain  and Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
