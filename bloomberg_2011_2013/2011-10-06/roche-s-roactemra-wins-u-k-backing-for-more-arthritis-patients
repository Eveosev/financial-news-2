Roche Holding AG (ROG)  won the backing of
the U.K. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
for the RoActemra rheumatoid arthritis drug after agreeing to
provide a discount to the state-run medical system.  RoActemra may be used at additional stages of treating the
disease under new draft treatment guidelines, according to an e-
mailed statement from the agency, known as NICE. Roche, based in
Basel,  Switzerland , must provide a discount on the medicine,
which costs 9,295 pounds ($14,225) a year for a patient weighing
about 70 kilograms (154 pounds). The level of the discount will
remain confidential, NICE said.  The  agency  last year recommended RoActemra as an option for
rheumatoid arthritis patients who either hadn’t had an adequate
response to one or more medicines or couldn’t take Roche’s
Rituxan. NICE advises the  National Health Service  on which
therapies represent value for money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
