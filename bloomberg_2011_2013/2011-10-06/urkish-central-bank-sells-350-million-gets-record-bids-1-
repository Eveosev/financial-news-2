Turkey ’s central bank sold $350
million for liras in an auction, selling about a quarter of the
$1.35 billion it said it may offer.  The central bank in Ankara got $2.04 billion of bids in the
auction, the most since the daily auctions began on Aug. 5,
according to data published on the bank’s website today.  Governor Erdem Basci sold $750 million yesterday, a record
amount for such a sale, as it sought to defend the currency
after it fell to a record low of 1.9096 on Aug. 4.  The lira pared earlier gains, rising 1.1 percent to 1.8478
per dollar at 2:25 p.m. in Istanbul.  Today’s sale equals the amount sold on Sept. 20., the day
after the lira declined to 1.8 per dollar  To contact the reporter on this story:
