Delek Real Estate Ltd. (DLKR)  closed at the
highest in a month after bondholders agreed to the delay of a
principal payment and accepted a deal with controlling
shareholder Isaac Tshuva.  Delek Real Estate, which yesterday said it completed the
sale of two Canadian assets, rose 4.9 percent to 0.171 shekel,
the highest since Sept. 8, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.
The shares surged 17 percent in the past two days.  The  Ramat Gan , Israel-based company has been in
negotiations with bondholders over its debt and has been selling
off Canadian and other assets. In August, Tshuva agreed to give
an international investment fund his stake for a 500 million-
shekel ($135 million) investment in the company.  The bondholders agreed to delay the payment of their
principal until Jan. 31, the company said in a statement to the
 Tel Aviv  Stock Exchange. Delek has a long-term debt-to-capital
ratio of 81 percent, according to Bloomberg data. Ninety-eight
percent of the companies on the TA-100 index show a better
ratio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
