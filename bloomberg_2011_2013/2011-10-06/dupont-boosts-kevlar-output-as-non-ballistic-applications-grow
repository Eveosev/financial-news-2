DuPont Co., the inventor of Kevlar
used in body armor, said the opening of a $500 million U.S.
plant today will allow for growth in other uses for the
material, such as tires, auto parts and fiber-optic cables.  The Cooper River Kevlar plant near Charleston,  South
Carolina , will initially increase global Kevlar production by 25
percent and eventually boost output 40 percent above its current
level, Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont said today in a
statement.  While Kevlar is best known as a critical element in
bulletproof vests and helmets, ballistics account for less than
a third of demand as U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan
and  Iraq  winds down, Thomas G. Powell, president of DuPont
Protection Technologies, said in a telephone interview.  The expansion of production is mostly to serve other
markets, such as the strengthening of fiber-optic cables, Powell
said. Demand for Kevlar in that application is growing 10
percent a year in the U.S. and 15 percent in  Asia , he said.
Ballistics demand is growing 10 percent annually, he said.  Kevlar is used in tires to reduce weight and energy use,
and in turbo-charged engines that require hoses and belts with
improved strength and heat resistance, DuPont said.  DuPont is one of the two largest producers of para-aramid
fibers, such as Kevlar, along with  Japan â€™s  Teijin Ltd. (3401) , Powell
said. DuPont invented Kevlar in 1965.  To contact the reporter on this story:
