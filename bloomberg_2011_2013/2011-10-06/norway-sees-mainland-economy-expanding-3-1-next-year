Norway said it sees mainland economic
growth accelerating to 3.1 percent next year from 2.8 percent
this year, according to todayâ€™s budget. Underlying inflation
will accelerate to 1.8 percent next year from 1.1 percent this
year as unemployment will remain at 3.3 percent for both years.  Overall economic growth, including oil and shipping output,
will be 2.4 percent next year, up from 1.7 percent this year,
the government said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
