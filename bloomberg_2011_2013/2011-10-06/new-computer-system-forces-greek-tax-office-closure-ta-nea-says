Tax offices in the Greek capital of
 Athens  will be closed today and tomorrow as the government
transfers data to a new computer system, Ta Nea reported,
without citing anyone.  Tax collection in Thessaloniki,  Greece â€™s second largest
city, and the port city of Piraeus will also be affected, the
Athens-based newspaper said. The tax offices are expected to
resume operations Oct. 10, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
