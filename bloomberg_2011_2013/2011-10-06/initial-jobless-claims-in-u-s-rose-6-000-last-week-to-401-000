Claims for U.S. unemployment benefits
rose less than forecast last week to a level that shows
companies may be starting to slow the pace of dismissals.  Applications for jobless benefits increased by 6,000 in the
week ended Oct. 1 to 401,000, Labor Department figures showed
today. Economists projected 410,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The monthly average
dropped to the lowest level since the end of August.  Reductions in firings may set the stage for bigger gains in
payrolls needed to bring down the  unemployment rate , signaling
more confidence among companies that demand will hold up.
Employers added 59,000 workers to payrolls in September and the
unemployment rate held at 9.1 percent, according to the median
forecast of economists before tomorrow’s jobs report.  “The 400,000 level is sort of a big level; below that is
consistent with better labor market progress,” said Sean
Incremona, a senior economist at 4Cast Inc. in New York. Still,
“at this stage, it does seem like the labor market is
stagnating,” he said.  Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 385,000 to
435,000 in the Bloomberg survey of 50 economists. The Labor
Department initially reported the prior week’s applications at
391,000, citing difficulties with seasonal adjustments to the
data.  Stock-index futures held gains after the report. The
contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in December
rose 0.7 percent to 1,142.8 at 8:47 a.m. in  New York . Treasuries
fell, pushing up the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to 1.96
percent from 1.89 percent late yesterday.  Monthly Average  The four-week moving average of claims, a less-volatile
measure, fell to 414,000, the lowest since Aug. 27, from
418,000. Filings are below the level seen before  Hurricane Irene 
struck the eastern seaboard at the end of August.  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
dropped by 52,000 in the week ended Sept. 24 to 3.7 million, the
fewest since July 30. The continuing claims figure does not
include the number of workers receiving extended benefits under
federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
28,370 to 3.55 million in the week ended Sept. 17.  The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 2.9 percent in
the week ended Sept. 24, from 3 percent, today’s report showed.
Forty states and territories reported a decrease in claims
during that week, while 13 showed an increase.  Payrolls, Claims  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , testifying this
week before Congress’s Joint Economic Committee in  Washington ,
said the central bank stood ready to take additional steps to
boost growth and urged lawmakers against taking steps to curtain
the  budget deficit  that might harm an already “sluggish”
recovery.  Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) , the largest U.S. warehouse-club
chain, said the strain on household budgets from limited job and
income growth is helping drive more customers to its stores to
save on groceries and other goods.  “We’re concerned as every one of you are out there every
day with the gyrations in the market and the mortgage statistics
and the unemployment statistics,” Chief Financial Officer
Richard Galanti said on a conference call with analysts
yesterday. “If you asked us do we feel good about what’s going
on out there, no, in terms of the economy.”  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s largest defense
contractor, said last month it is cutting 540 jobs, mostly in
Texas, Georgia and  California . The reduction is part of a plan
to cut 1,500 workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
