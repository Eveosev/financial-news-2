About 21 percent of all the sugar
waiting to be loaded at ports in  Brazil , the world’s largest
producer of the commodity, will be shipped to China and Egypt,
according to data from Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  Vessels heading to China will load 127,500 metric tons this
month, while 160,950 tons will head to Egypt, data from the
shipping agency showed. As many as 44 vessels were waiting at
the ports of Recife, Suape, Maceio, Santos and Paranagua
yesterday to load 1.35 million tons of the sweetener. That
compares with 46 ships and 1.3 million tons on Sept. 28, the
data showed.  Egypt’s state-owned Sugar and Integrated Industries Co.’s
imports of raw sugar will exceed 400,000 tons this year. Since
the year began the company has agreed to buy 365,000 tons, and
150,000 tons have been delivered, Hussein Ahmed, a purchasing
manager, said in an interview in Cairo on Sept. 22.  China  may need to import as much as 3 million tons of the
sweetener in 2011-12, as production will lag behind demand by
2.5 million tons, according to Sucden, the trading arm of Paris-
based company Sucres et Denrees SA.  China has to “cover their own domestic production
shortfall and rebuild government reserve stocks,” Luis Rangel,
vice president of commodity derivatives at ICAP Futures LLC in
 Jersey City ,  New Jersey  wrote in a report dated Sept. 29.  ED&F Man Holdings Ltd, Bunge Ltd. and Cargill Inc. will be
sending the sweetener to Egypt, while Noble Group Ltd., Bunge
and Louis Dreyfus will be shipping to China, the data show.  White, or refined, sugar for December delivery rose $5.60,
or 0.9 percent, to $654 a ton by 10:24 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
 London . Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.19 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 24.99 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
