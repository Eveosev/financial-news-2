Chilean students marched in downtown
Santiago today, clashing with police and blocking traffic for
much of the day, after negotiations with the government over
education reforms broke down last night.  “This has been one of the most violent marches” after
four months of demonstrations, newspaper  La Tercera  quoted
Santiago Mayor Pablo Zalaquett as  saying .  At least 28 people were arrested and six police officers
injured during the protests, Cecilia Perez, government
administrator for the Metropolitan Region, said in images
transmitted on national TV. Police used water cannons and doused
the area with tear gas as they attempted to block the
unauthorized march, Perez said.  The student federation, known as Confech, will vote Oct. 8
whether to continue talks with the government after its leaders
yesterday disagreed with Education Minister Felipe Bulnes on
ways to cut the cost of education for households, protest leader
Camila Vallejo said last night.  Students, who have held 37 marches in Santiago since the
protest movement started, want the government to do more than
increase scholarships for poor students, calling for higher
taxes on the wealthy to fund free education, Vallejo said in
images transmitted on CNN  Chile .  “I’ve told students on numerous occasions that working
under the logic of all or nothing won’t lead to progress,”
Bulnes said in images transmitted on state television. “They
can’t base structural reform on free education for all
students.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
