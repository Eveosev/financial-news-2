Hong Kong’s new grade-A office space
supply will fall short of demand unless the city suffers a sharp
economic contraction, according to a  Royal Institution  of
Chartered Surveyors study.  A total of 5.25 million square feet of office space is
estimated to be built from 2011 to 2014, the institution said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday. The 1.3 million square feet of
additional annual supply is a “substantial decline” compared
with the 1.9 million square feet added each year between 1995
and 2011, according to the study done by  CB Richard Ellis Group
Inc. (CBG)  on the institute’s behalf.  The level of supply will only meet demand should the city’s
annual economic growth fall by 5 percent, it added.  “ The underlying strength of the Hong Kong economy,
however, suggests that there will be a further fall in vacancy
rates in the very near term,” it said. “Respondents believed
multinationals will be deterred from entering or expanding in
 Hong Kong  because of the shortage in office space.”  In a response to the institute’s report, Hong Kong’s
government said it is trying to provide more office sites and
has enlarged the Central Business District to include
neighboring Sheung Wan, Admiralty, Wan Chai, Causeway, Tsim Sha
Tsui and West Kowloon, according to a  statement  on its website
yesterday.  It has further encouraged businesses to decentralize their
offices by investing in transport infrastructure, the statement
added.  --  To contact the reporter on this story:
