Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for the
second day against the dollar after the  central bank  raised its
benchmark  interest rate  to curb inflation AND stem the
currency’s decline to the weakest on record.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
0.5 percent to 100.85 per dollar by 11:29 a.m. in Nairobi.  The Central Bank of Kenya yesterday increased its rate by a
record 4 percentage points to 11 percent, signalling a policy
shift in a bid to combat inflation of 17.3 percent, more than
triple the government’s target.  “The decision by central bank to raise its rate has
positively supported the shilling,” Duncan Kinuthia a trader at
Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone.  The shilling has depreciated 20 percent this year, making
it the world’s worst performer against the dollar. It reached a
record-low 104.2 on Sept. 27 as the worst regional drought in 60
years boosted food prices.
