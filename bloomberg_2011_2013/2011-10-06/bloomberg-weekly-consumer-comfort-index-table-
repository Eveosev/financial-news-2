The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort
index rose last week to -50.2 from -53.0 a week earlier.  Following is a table with the latest survey results:  The CCI is reported in a four-week rolling average; this week’s results are 
based on telephone interviews among a random national sample of 1,000 adults 
in the four weeks ending Oct. 2. The results have a 3-point error
margin. Field work by SSRS/Social Science Research Solutions of Media, Pa.  The index is derived by subtracting the negative response to each index 
question from the positive response to that question. The three resulting 
numbers are added and divided by three.  The index can range from +100 (everyone positive on all three measures) 
to -100 (all negative on all three measures). The survey began in 
December 1985.     Survey questions:
Would you describe the state of the nation’s economy these days as
excellent, good, not so good, or poor?  Would you describe the state of your own personal finances these
days as excellent, good, not so good, or poor?  Considering the cost of things today and your own personal finances,
would you say now is an excellent time, a good time, a not so good
time or a poor time to buy the things you want and need?  SOURCE: Bloomberg News  To contact the reporter on this story:
