The  Federal Reserve  sold $8.87
billion in Treasury securities maturing in less than one year as
part of its plan to lower borrowing costs that’s become known as
Operation Twist.  The central bank sold debt maturing from January 2012 to
July 2012, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s
 website . Today’s sale is the first by the central bank under the
program announced Sept. 21. Purchases began Oct. 3. The Fed last
sold  U.S. government debt  in May 2008.  The Fed is replacing $400 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce
borrowing costs further and counter rising risks of a recession.
The central bank will buy securities with maturities of six
to 30 years through June while selling an equal amount of debt
maturing in three years or less. The central bank will buy
 Treasury securities  13 times a month and sell its holdings of
U.S. government debt six times.  Policy makers also announced last month that it would
switch the reinvestment of its holdings of maturing housing debt
to mortgage-backed securities from Treasuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
