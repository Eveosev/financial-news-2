The French economy will probably
stall in the fourth quarter after expanding 0.3 percent in the
previous three months as investment and job creation falter,
national statistics office Insee forecast.  Europe ’s debt crisis “has created a shock to the real
economy and is affecting growth,” Insee economist Sandrine
Duchene told reporters in Paris. “Investment and employment
have been the two engines of  France ’s recovery so far and both
are going to slow between now and the end of the year.”  Gross domestic product may expand 1.7 percent this year, in
line with the government’s prediction, Paris-based Insee said in
a report today. GDP stalled in the second quarter after growing
0.9 percent in the first three months.  Consumer spending  may
rise about 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent in the final two quarters
of the year, according to the report.  “The only support for the economy is household spending,
which should rebound in the third quarter after a downturn in
the second,” Insee said. “The savings ratio of French
households is likely to be maintained.”  About 24,000 jobs will be created by French companies in
the second half, down from 112,000 in the first, Insee said.
Unemployment is set to increase to 9.7 percent, from 9.6 percent
at the end of the second quarter, Insee added.  Investment by non-financial companies will probably
increase 0.3 percent and 0.1 percent in the final two quarters
of the year, compared with gains of 1.9 percent and 0.3 percent
in the first and second quarters, Insee predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
