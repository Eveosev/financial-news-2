The Carolina Hurricanes beat the
Atlanta Thrashers 6-1 last night to tie the  New York Rangers  for
the eighth and final playoff spot in the National Hockey
Leagueâ€™s Eastern Conference.  The Hurricanes and Rangers have 91 points going into their
final games of the season today. The Rangers host New Jersey at
12:30 p.m.  New York  time and  Tampa Bay  is at Carolina at 7 p.m.  If the teams finish tied, Carolina makes the playoffs
because it holds the first tiebreaker, most wins excluding those
from shootouts. The Hurricanes will clinch the playoff spot with
a win today or a Rangers loss in regulation time. New York must
win and have Carolina lose in regulation time. There are other
scenarios involving overtime or shootout results which would
give either team the final postseason place.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
