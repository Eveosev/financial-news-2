Peter Praet, who joins the Executive
Board of the  European Central Bank  in June, said the ECB needs
to raise  interest rates  “fast enough” as oil prices remain
high, De Standaard reported, citing an interview.  “The current oil shock is the worst thing that can happen
to a central bank,” the newspaper quoted Praet as saying.
“Then you get a negative supply shock and inflationary
pressures, which makes ensuring price stability more difficult.
And so you have to, where necessary, start raising rates fast
enough,” Praet was quoted as saying.  “Some say the oil shock is temporary, but I believe not,”
Praet said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
