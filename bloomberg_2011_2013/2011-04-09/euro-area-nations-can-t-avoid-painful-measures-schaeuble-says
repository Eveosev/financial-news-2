German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said euro-area governments won’t be able to avoid
“painful” budget consolidation measures.  Over-indebted euro countries “can’t get around a process
of painful adjustment measures,” Schaeuble told reporters today
in Godollo, Hungary, after a two-day meeting of European Union
finance ministers and central bank governors. “Ideas that have
been voiced also in the German public that there is false
solidarity for misbehavior contradict everything that’s actually
happening.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
