The Monetary Authority of  Singapore 
said the Southeast Asian city is “well-positioned” to support
business with mainland  China  as bilateral trade increased and
banks started offering services in the Chinese currency.  In 2010, bilateral trade between Singapore and China
reached S$95.3 billion ($75.8 billion), a gain of 26 percent
from a year earlier, the MAS wrote in an e-mail to Bloomberg
News today. “China was Singapore’s second-largest trading
partner in 2010,” the authority said.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that the MAS is in
talks with the People’s Bank of China on making Singapore a hub
for trading of the Chinese currency. China’s central bank has
been “receptive” to such a move, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified people.  “With the increasing internationalization of the renminbi
and expansion of the cross-border trade settlement pilot scheme
by China, Singapore is well-positioned to facilitate trade-
linked business flows with mainland China,” the MAS said in its
e-mail. “Several banks in Singapore have begun offering
renminbi banking services to their clients.”  There are about 3,000 Chinese companies in Singapore and
more than 150 Chinese companies are listed on the  Singapore
Exchange , the MAS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
