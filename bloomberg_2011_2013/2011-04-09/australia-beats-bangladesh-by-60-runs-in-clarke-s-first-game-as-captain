A century from new captain  Michael
Clarke  led Australia to a 60-run win over Bangladesh to open
their one-day cricket series.  Clarke scored 101 runs from 111 balls as Australia reached
270-7 in its 50 overs after being put in to bat in Mirpur,
Bangladesh. The hosts could only reach 210-5 in response, with
opener Tamim Iqbal scoring 62.  It was Clarke’s first game as skipper since replacing  Ricky
Ponting , who resigned as Test and one-day captain last month.
Ponting scored 34 today, opener Shane Watson had 37 and Mitchell
Johnson was 26 not out for the visitors.  Shakib Al Hassan scored 51 and Mushfiqur Rahim finished 44
not out for Bangladesh, while Suhrawadi Shuvo took 3-44. The
three-game series continues April 11 in Dhaka.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
