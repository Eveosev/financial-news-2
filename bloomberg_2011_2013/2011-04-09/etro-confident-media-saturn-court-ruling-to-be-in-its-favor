Metro AG (MEO) , Germany’s largest
retailer, said it’s “confident” that a court ruling on a
lawsuit filed by one of the minority shareholders in its Media-
Saturn unit will be in its favor.  The company expects the court review to be “concluded
promptly,” according to an e-mailed statement from Dusseldorf,
Germany-based Metro today. Chief Executive Officer Eckhard Cordes is prepared to talk to the minority shareholders of the
Media-Saturn electronics chain to find a “constructive
solution” to the situation, it said.  Metro made the comments after the two founders of Media-
Saturn, Erich Kellerhals and Leopold Stiefel, criticized the
company in an interview with  Der Spiegel  magazine and said it
may take Metro to  Germany ’s top court. Kellerhals, who owns 21.6
percent of Media-Saturn, has filed a lawsuit against Metro
claiming that the company failed to respect contracts.  Kellerhals says Metro is trying to take away the right of
minority shareholders to block some decisions. The Kaufhof
department-store chain, a Metro unit since 1996, bought the
majority of Media-Saturn in 1988 and gave founders some
“blocking rights.” Minority owners hold 25 percent.  Metro CEO Cordes said March 22 that the company wants to
speed up decision-making at Media-Saturn including the start of
an online sales platform in Germany and future expansion plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
