German Health Minister Philipp Roesler, whoâ€™s running to become leader of the Free Democratic
Party, said fiscal consolidation is more important than tax
cuts,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  reported.  If the tax estimate in May is better than expected, Roesler
wants to use it for fiscal consolidation because a stable euro
is more important for people in  Germany  at the moment than lower
taxes, the newspaper cited him as saying in an e-mailed preview
of an article to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
