Honda Motor Co. denied a report it
may temporarily halt U.S. production early next month due to a
parts shortage following  Japan ’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami,
saying it will continue a reduced schedule until at least April
22.  “We don’t plan to halt production in the U.S.,” Keitaro
Yamamoto, a spokesman for Honda in Tokyo, said by telephone
today.  The company has cut its daily North American production to
3,700 units from 5,700 before the disaster, he said. That
reduction will continue until at least April 22, he said, adding
that a decision on further extending the cuts will be based on
the availability of parts.  The Asahi newspaper reported earlier today that Honda was
considering halting U.S. production in early May, without saying
how it got the information. Honda plans to cut its output in the
U.S. to 50 percent of full capacity this month from the current
60 percent, the newspaper reported.  The carmaker is so far sticking to its sales plan for the
U.S., where it earns most of its profit. Honda expects U.S.
customers to buy 1.35 million Honda and Acura cars and light
trucks this year, maintaining a target set at the start of the
year, John Mendel, the company’s U.S. executive vice president,
said in an April 7 interview. That’s 9.8 percent more than the
1.23 million vehicles Tokyo-based Honda sold in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
