     April 9 (Bloomberg) -- Germany ’s ministers for environment
and the economy want billions of euros for an energy aid
program, the Stuttgarter Zeitung reported today, citing a paper
prepared by the ministers.  The program would fund energy-savings efforts such as
renovating buildings to make them energy efficient and making
new sites available for wind farms, the report said.  The paper is to be discussed at a ministers’ meeting with
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  on April 15 which the authors of the
paper, Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen and Economy
Minister Rainer Bruederle, will also attend, the newspaper said,
citing people familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
