Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s biggest oil
and gas producer, evacuated all non-essential staff from its
Visund platform today after a  report of  a gas leak.  “Somebody observed gas on the water’s surface about 180
meters from the platform,” company spokesman Lars Dahle said in
a phone interview. “That is what caused the alarm and the
mobilization of  emergency services .”  About half of the 120 staff on the platform were taken off
by helicopter as part of a safety protocol. No injuries or
platform damage was reported, Dahle said. Statoil suspended
production at Visund yesterday after damage to flexible risers
was detected at the Njord field.  “The gas leak that was reported at the Visund platform
this morning was confirmed stopped just before 1 p.m.,” Statoil
said in a later statement. “Evacuated personnel will be
returned to the platform.”  Visund, a floating production, drilling and living quarters
in the Norwegian  North Sea , began producing gas and exporting it
to continental  Europe  in 2005. Statoil is the operator with a 53
percent stake, while Petoro AS has 30 percent, ConocoPhillips
Skandinavia holds 9 percent and Total E&P Norge has almost 8
percent, according to Statoil’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
