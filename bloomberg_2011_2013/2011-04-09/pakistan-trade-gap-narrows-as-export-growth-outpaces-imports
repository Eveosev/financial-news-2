Pakistan ’s trade deficit narrowed by
39 percent in March as exports from the country grew at a faster
rate than imports.  The  trade gap  narrowed to $920 million in the ninth month
of the country’s financial year, from $1.5 billion in the year-
earlier period, according to a statement posted on the  website 
of the Islamabad-based Federal Bureau of Statistics. Overseas
sales rose 41 percent to $2.5 billion, while imports increased 4
percent to $3.4 billion.  Pakistan is seeking to boost exports to sustain growth in a
country where the  World Bank  estimates a quarter of the
population lives on less than a dollar a day.  Export growth in March was slower than the 42 percent in
February, and import growth fell short of the 22 percent
increase in the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
