Regen Powertech Pvt. ,  India ’s fifth-
largest supplier of  wind turbines , plans to build its second
manufacturing plant in the south Asian nation by 2012.  The company expects to begin production at the new facility
near Udaipur in the western Rajasthan state by January, K.
Varahala Rao, a director at the company, said in an interview in
Chennai today. The plant will be able to produce up to 300
turbines a year, he said.  The Chennai-based company will also introduce a new 2.5-
megawatt turbine during the financial year ending March 2013,
Rao said. It currently makes 1.5-megawatt turbines.  Indian farms are installing larger, more efficient turbines
of 2-megawatt capacity or higher as the number of sites
experiencing high wind speeds dwindles. Germany’s  Siemens AG (SIE)  and
Spain’s Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA also plan to
manufacture and sell 2-megawatt turbines in India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
