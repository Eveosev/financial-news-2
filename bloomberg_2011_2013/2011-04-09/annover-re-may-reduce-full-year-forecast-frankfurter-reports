Hannover Re  may cut its full-year
profit forecast following the earthquake and tsunami in Japan,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  reported, citing an
interview with Chief Financial Officer Roland Vogel.  The reinsurer is awaiting the first-quarter results before
it can update its 2011 projection, Vogel said in the preview of
an article that will be published in the newspaper tomorrow. A
larger-than-expected tax gain may help Hannover Re to avoid a
loss in the first three months of the year, the newspaper cited
him as saying.  Hannover Re sold its entire equities portfolio in the first
quarter because of uncertainty in financial markets, Vogel told
Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.  Hannover Re, the worldâ€™s third-biggest reinsurer, estimates
its claims from the natural disaster in  Japan  at about 250
million euros ($362 million), it said March 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
