German bonds fell for a third week
as the  European Central Bank  raised  interest rates  for the first
time in almost three years. Portuguese and Greek yields rose as
Portugal sought a bailout from the European Union.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  increased the benchmark
rate by 25 basis points from a record low of 1 percent to tackle
rising inflation pressures, a move predicted by all 57
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Portugal failed to stem a
surge in borrowing costs, even as it followed  Greece  and Ireland
in asking the EU for a financial assistance package estimated at
80 billion euros ($115 billion).  The ECB “was quite hawkish,” said  Vincent Chaigneau , head
of rate strategy at Societe Generale SA in London. “There is
more adjustment coming, higher in yields, at the front end of
the curve.  Portugal  has lagged and Greece has been faring pretty
badly.”  Germany’s 10-year yield increased 10 basis points in the
week to 3.48 percent at 4 p.m. in London yesterday, after
reaching the most since Aug. 13, 2009. Yields on two-year notes
rose eight basis points to 1.90 percent, after reaching 1.92
percent, the highest since December 18 2008.  European inflation risks remain on the upside and the ECB’s
monetary policy is still “accommodative,” Trichet said at a
press conference in  Frankfurt  after the rate decision.  Data next week is expected to confirm consumer prices
accelerated to the fastest in more than two years in March.  Debt Sale  Portugal requested financial aid after it sold 1 billion
euros ($1.4 billion) of bills this week, paying more to borrow
for six months than it costs  Germany  for 30 years of funding. It
faces redemptions totalling 9 billion euros ($12.9 billion) in
April and June.  Portuguese 10-year bonds fell 13 out of the previous 14
days, pushing the yield to as high as 8.80 percent, the most
since the introduction of the euro in 1999. Two-year note yields
surged to 9.3 percent yesterday, also a euro-era high. Greek
two-year yields climbed to as high as 16.43 percent, the most
since March 15.  The Iberian nation’s debt ranks as the worst performer in
2011, down 10.1 percent, as investors price in concerns of a
default. Bunds lost 2.7 percent in the same period according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg.  Germany will auction 3 billion euros of interest linked
bonds and 2 billion euros of 30-year notes next week. Italy
plans to sell debt maturing in 2016 and 2023, while the
Netherland auctions up to 2 billion euros of debt maturing in
2042. Portugal faces its first bond redemption on Friday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
