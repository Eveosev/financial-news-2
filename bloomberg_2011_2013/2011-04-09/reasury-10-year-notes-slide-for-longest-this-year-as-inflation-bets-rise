Treasury notes fell for a third
week, the longest slump for benchmark 10-year securities this
year, as traders bet inflation will accelerate, oil reached $113
a barrel and gold climbed to a record.  An inflation gauge used by the  Federal Reserve  reached the
highest level in a month as minutes of the central bank’s last
meeting showed policy makers differed over whether to begin
removing record stimulus. Data next week is forecast to show the
consumer price index rose in March. The Treasury will sell $66
billion of notes and bonds next week.  “The Fed’s acknowledging increasing inflation
expectations,” said  Priya Misra , head of U.S. rates strategy at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York, one of the 20 primary
dealers that trade with the central bank. “That’s putting more
pressure on yields. Momentum is going to be for higher rates.”  The 10-year yield rose 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage
point, to 3.58 percent, from 3.44 percent on April 1. It touched
3.61 percent, the highest level since Feb. 18. The 3.625 percent
note due in February 2021 fell 1 1/8, or $11.25 per $1,000 face
amount, to 100 3/8. Two-year note yields increased one basis
point to 0.81 percent in their third weekly rise, the longest
stretch since November.  Thirty-year bond yields climbed 16 basis points, the most
since the week ended Feb. 4, to 4.64 percent. They touched 4.67
percent yesterday, the highest level since March 9.  Treasury Auctions  Treasuries also slid as the U.S. prepared to auction $32
billion of 3-year notes, $21 billion of 10-year debt and $13
billion of 30-year bonds in three daily sales starting April 12.  A bond-market measure of inflation expectations that the
Fed uses to help determine monetary policy, the five-year
forward inflation rate, increased to 3.01 percentage points, the
most since March 8. The measure has averaged 2.78 percent over
the past five years.  “Anticipation of inflation data and Treasury supply next
week are sending Treasury yields even higher,” said Tom di Galoma, head of U.S. rates trading at Guggenheim Capital Markets
LLC, a  New-York  based brokerage for institutional investors.  The likelihood the Fed will boost  interest rates  this year
is 36 percent, and the chance of one in the first quarter of
2012 is 70 percent, Federal funds futures contracts showed. The
central bank has held the benchmark rate at zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008 to support the economy.  Dollar Slumps  The Dollar Index, which InterContinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback versus the currencies of six major
trading partners, sank to as low as 74.838 yesterday, the least
since December 2009, as U.S. lawmakers struggled to reach a
last-minute budget deal to avoid a government shutdown.  U.S. government debt  gained 0.8 percent during the 21-day
government closure at the end of 1995 and the start of 1996,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.  Fed policy makers were divided last month over whether to
begin removing stimulus this year as they debated the path of
policy after the completion of a $600 billion bond-purchase
program, according to minutes of the March 15 meeting released
this week. They have differed since then in public statements.  The Fed is “near a tipping point” and risks over-
stimulating the economy and generating inflation,  Dallas  Fed
President  Richard Fisher  said yesterday in Dallas to the Society
of American Business Editors and Writers.  Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart  said the Fed should
take its time in withdrawing economic stimulus amid moderate
growth and a quickening of inflation that will probably prove
temporary. The economy has “a halting and fragile quality,” he
said in a speech yesterday in Knoxville,  Tennessee .  ‘Transitory’ Increase  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on April 5 policy makers
must watch inflation “extremely closely” for evidence that
rising commodity costs are having more than a temporary impact
on consumer prices. If inflation expectations are stable and the
rise in commodities slows, “the increase in inflation will be
transitory,” he said after a speech in Stone Mountain,  Georgia .  The yield gap between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities and conventional U.S. notes, a gauge of trader
expectations for prices over the life of the debt, reached 2.66
percentage points, the most since March 2008. The measure
reached 2.74 percent in 2006 prior to the U.S. recession. It
averaged 2.08 percent over the past five years.  The  consumer price index  accelerated to 2.6 percent in
March from a year earlier, from 2.1 percent in February,
economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast before the Labor
Department reports the data on April 15.  The Fed’s preferred
measure of inflation, which excludes food and energy, increased
at an annualized 0.9 percent in February.  Crude Climbs  Crude oil for May delivery climbed above $113 a barrel in
New York yesterday for the first time since September 2008 amid
skepticism Libyan output will rebound when fighting ends and as
a weaker dollar increased demand for raw materials. Gold reached
$1,475.60 an ounce.  Treasuries also fell this week as the  European Central Bank 
raised its main refinancing rate by a quarter-percentage point
from 1 percent, where it had been since May 2009.  Six- and three-month bill rates dropped as the Treasury cut
to $5 billion from $200 billion the amount of outstanding
Supplementary Financing Program bills it sells on behalf of the
Fed in a program to support the financial system. The reduction
was made as the U.S. approaches its debt limit.  Six-month rates tumbled to a record 0.1048 percent. Three-
month rates slid to 0.0203 percent, the lowest level since
December 2009.  Treasury yields are below levels seen in the past decade
even as government borrowing increases. Ten-year rates climbed
as high as 5.53 percent in 2001 as traders speculated on when
the Fed would finish cutting borrowing costs. The rate has
averaged 4.12 percent over the past 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
