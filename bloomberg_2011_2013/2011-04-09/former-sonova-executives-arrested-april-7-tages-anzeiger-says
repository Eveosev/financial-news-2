Sonova Holding AG (SOON) ’s former chief
executive officer, Valentin Chapero, and its former chief
financial officer, Oliver Walker, spent April 7 in custody,
Tages-Anzeiger said.  The two former executives were subsequently released, the
 newspaper  reported today, without saying where it got the
information. Sonova spokesman Sacha Wigdorovits couldn’t be
immediately reached for comment by Bloomberg News.  Sonova, the world’s biggest hearing-aid maker by sales, is
under investigation by the Zurich prosecutor’s office over
insider sales of shares and options before the company cut its
profit forecast last month. Both Chapero and Walker resigned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
