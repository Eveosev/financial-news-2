Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
is resisting increasing gasoline prices,  O Estado de S. Paulo 
reported, citing Mining and Energy Minister Edison Lobao.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  has been pushing the government to
raise prices, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper quoted Lobao as
saying. Lobao, who is also resisting a price increase, told the
newspaper that higher gasoline costs are inevitable should  crude
oil  continue to gain.  Brazil  is also studying a tax on sugar exports to encourage
sugar-cane mills to boost ethanol production after the biofuelâ€™s
prices climbed, Estado reported, citing Lobao.  To contact the reporter on this story:
