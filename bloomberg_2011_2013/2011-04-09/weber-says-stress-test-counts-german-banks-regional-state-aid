(Corrects to remove reference to capital from savings banks
in fifth paragraph.)  Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  said
funds received by German lenders from their regional state
owners will be counted as core capital in the European Union’s
banking stress tests.  State aid such as capital and silent participations from
rescue measures will count in the  stress test  “as hard, core
capital completely equivalent to share capital,” Weber said at
a press conference in Godollo,  Hungary  today. Landesbanken that
weren’t bailed out by  Germany ’s Soffin bank-rescue fund and
instead got capital from their regional states can use that
money in their calculations for core Tier 1 ratios, he said.  The European Banking Authority said yesterday it will use a
tougher measure of capital on 90 lenders following criticism
that last year’s tests weren’t stringent enough, with banks
expected to maintain a core Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 5
percent under the new scenarios. The ratio is a measure of a
bank’s financial strength.  For WestLB AG, Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg and  Bayerische
Landesbank , “for example, capital deposits that are silent also
count as core capital,” said Weber, a member of the European
Central Bank Governing Council. Silent participations are a type
of non-voting capital that’s used in Germany.  The VOeB Association of German Public Sector Banks said
yesterday that according to the information it had received from
the EBA, silent participations from regional German states would
not be counted as core capital in the stress test of banks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
