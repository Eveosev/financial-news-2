Elizabeth Taylor ’s collection of
art, jewels, dresses and memorabilia will be sold by Christie’s
auction house.  The items will be sold in a series of auctions, Christie’s
said today in a press release. The value of the estate and the
dates of the sales haven’t been determined, according to
Christie’s spokesman Toby Usnik.  Taylor, who died last month at 79, was known for her lavish
jewels and torrid love affairs. She had eight marriages and her
husbands included actor  Richard Burton , U.S. Senator John Warner
and producer Mike Todd.  Christie’s  is “most honored to have been entrusted with
the collection of this world-renowned film legend, humanitarian
and tastemaker,” Marc Porter, chairman of Christie’s Americas,
said in a statement.  A two-time Oscar winner and early AIDS activist, Taylor
raised millions for research and treatment of the disease.  In 1999, Taylor donated the periwinkle gown she wore to the
1969  Academy Awards  ceremony to a Christie’s auction that raised
$786,120 for the  American Foundation for AIDS Research .  The dress matched her eyes and showed off her ample
cleavage. It fetched $167,500.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
