Brazil  suspended plans to buy at
least four MI-35 helicopters from  Russia ,  O Estado de S. Paulo 
reported, citing an Air Force official the newspaper didnâ€™t
identify.  Technical problems with the existing machines and budget
cuts caused the Brazilian government to suspend the acquisition,
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  Brazil bought 12 MI-35 helicopters in 2008 for $250
million, o Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
