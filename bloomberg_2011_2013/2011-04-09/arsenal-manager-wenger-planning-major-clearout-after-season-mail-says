Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  is
planning a major shake-up to his squad after the season, the
 Daily Mail  said.  Andrey Arshavin, who joined the Gunners for a club record
15 million pounds ($24.5 million) in 2009, defender Gael Clichy
and striker Nicklas Bendtner will be among the top stars
departing as Arsenal closes on a sixth straight season without a
trophy, the Mail said.  Wenger will also consider offers for midfielders Emmanuel
Eboue, Tomas Rosicky, Abou Diaby and Denilson, along with
goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, the Mail said.  Wenger hopes to recoup as much as 35 million pounds from
player sales this summer, the Mail said. Everton defender
Leighton Baines and Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer are among
the potential replacements, the newspapers said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
