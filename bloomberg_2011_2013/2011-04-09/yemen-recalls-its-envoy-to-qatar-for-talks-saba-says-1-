Yemen recalled its ambassador to
 Qatar  for consultation following remarks by Qatar’s prime
minister about political tensions in the Arabian Peninsula
country, state-run Saba news agency reported today.  Qatar’s prime minister, Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jaber Al Thani,
said April 7 that the Gulf Cooperation Council’s mediation
effort aimed at reaching a deal that would involve President Ali Abdullah Saleh stepping down. The main coalition of Yemen’s
opposition parties had agreed to attend the talks.  In the southern city of Taiz, the site of clashes in the
past week that left at least 15 protesters dead and hundreds
wounded, tens of thousands gathered calling for an end to
Saleh’s 32-year rule. Members of the opposition attacked the
provincial government headquarters of the city, Saba reported.  Mohammed Mukbil al-Himyari, a parliamentarian who resigned
from the ruling General People’s Congress, said the government
is attacking protesters using weapons provided by the U.S. and
 Europe  to fight terrorism.  The U.S. welcomed the GCC’s initiative yesterday, saying it
was encouraging “urgently needed dialogue.” Saleh ruled out
mediation by Persian Gulf countries that have offered to seek a
compromise between his regime and a growing protest movement
yesterday, calling the effort “blatant interference.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
