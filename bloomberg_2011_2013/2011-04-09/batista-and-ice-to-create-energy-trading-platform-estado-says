Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista ’s
EBX Group Co Ltd. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. are
creating a trading platform for electric power contracts,  O
Estado de S. Paulo  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The two companies will announce the plan on April 12, the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  An EBX spokeswoman didn’t immediately return two telephone
calls and an e-mail from Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
