Ballabriggs held off a late charge
from Oscar Time to win British horse racing’s Grand National.  Ballabriggs, a 14-1 choice ridden by Jason Maguire, won the
4 1/2-mile (7.2 kilometer) race at  Aintree , in northwest
 England , by 2 1/4 lengths. The 10-year-old is trained by Donald
McCain, the son of Ginger McCain, trainer of three-time National
winner Red Rum.  “It’s just fantastic,” Donald McCain said in an interview
with the British Broadcasting Corp. “Good horses are easy to
train. He’s just an absolute pleasure to work with.”  Ballabriggs moved up among the leaders at the 16th of 30
fences and went to the front with Niche Market (16-1) after the
27th fence. As Niche Market started to fade, 14-1 Oscar Time,
ridden by Sam Waley-Cohen, the amateur jockey who won the
Cheltenham Gold Cup last month, made his move as they approached
the final fence, but Maguire and Ballabriggs held on for the
victory.  Don’t Push It, last year’s winner ridden by Tony McCoy,
finished third. The second favorite at 9-1, Don’t Push It was
trying to become the first horse since Red Rum in 1973 and 1974
to win the Grand National in consecutive years.  State of Play (28-1) finished fourth with Niche Market (16-
1) fifth. The Midnight Club, the 8-1 race favorite, was sixth
among the 19 of 40 horses to finish the race.  What A Friend, a 12-1 choice co-owned by Manchester United
manager  Alex Ferguson , failed to finish after pulling up at the
27th fence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
