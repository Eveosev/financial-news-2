South African President  Jacob Zuma 
will travel to Libya tomorrow as part of an African Union
delegation to discuss a ceasefire with the country’s leader
 Muammar Qaddafi  and rebel forces, the Department of
International Relations and Cooperation said in an e-mailed
statement.  The delegation will meet with Qaddafi in Tripoli and with
rebel leaders in Benghazi, and has been given permission to
enter Libya by NATO, the statement said.  “Key on the Agenda of both meetings will be the immediate
implementation of a ceasefire from both sides and the opening of
a political dialogue between the two parties,” the statement
said.  Before traveling to Libya, Zuma will attend an AU meeting
on Libya in Mauritania, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
