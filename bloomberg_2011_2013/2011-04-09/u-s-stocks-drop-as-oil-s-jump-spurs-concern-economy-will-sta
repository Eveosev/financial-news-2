U.S. stocks fell this week,
preventing the third straight gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, as crude oil’s rally to a 30-month high spurred concern
that the global economy will slow.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  had the biggest decline in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , losing 2.9 percent, while  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) 
retreated 2.5 percent. FedEx Corp., which runs the world’s
biggest cargo airline, slumped 4 percent as oil advanced 4.5
percent.  Monsanto Co. (MON)  declined 9.5 percent after forecasting
less 2011 profit than analysts estimated.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent to 1,328.17 this week. The
Dow rose 3.33 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,380.05,
for its third straight weekly gain. The benchmark measure slid
after climbing to 12,426.75 on April 6, the highest closing
level since June 2008.  “Everyday, the price of oil marches higher, and it’s
surprising the equity markets aren’t reacting even more
negatively,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at
Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages
$53 billion. “Commodities are rallying across the board,”
adding to inflation concerns, he said.  The  S&P 500  has trimmed its loss since Feb. 18 to 1.1
percent. The index had tumbled as much as 6.4 percent through
March 16. It fell yesterday as a fire burned at Libya’s Sarir
field, increasing concern that unrest in north Africa and the
Middle East will spread, interrupting oil shipments.  Budget Negotiations  The S&P 500 erased its 0.1 percent gain for the week
yesterday as Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress
failed to reach agreement on a federal budget by the time U.S.
exchanges closed, raising the risk that the government will shut
down for the first time in more than 15 years.  Equities slipped on April 7 following a 7.1-magnitude
aftershock in  Japan , one of the strongest since the March 11
earthquake that was the strongest in the nation’s history. At
least three nuclear facilities lost some outside power, while
the damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant was spared.  “We’re still not that far removed from the Fukushima
disaster, the tsunami and the earthquake,” Luschini said. “I
don’t think anybody’s prepared for a reminder of that kind of
devastation. It was ‘sell first, ask questions later.’”  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, fell 2.9 percent to $109.82. Industrial stocks had
the biggest decline out of 10 industries in the S&P 500, sliding
1.4 percent. FedEx slumped 4 percent to $91.16. Disney dropped
2.5 percent to $41.76 as a gauge of S&P 500 companies reliant on
consumers’ discretionary spending lost 0.6 percent.  Higher Grain Prices  Monsanto slid 9.5 percent to $66.22, the largest decline in
the S&P 500. The world’s biggest seed company forecast 2011
earnings excluding some items of as little as $2.72 a share,
less than the average analyst estimate of $2.85, and said it
won’t raise prices to match surging grain values.  Airlines retreated as oil rose. The  NYSE Arca Airline (XAL)  Index
slumped 5.5 percent, the steepest five-day decline in six weeks.
 United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  sank 14 percent to $19.79.  AMR
Corp. (AMR)  fell 9.7 percent to $5.77.  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  declined 7.8 percent to $11.68. The
world’s biggest operator of Boeing Co. 737 jets said it will
inspect planes after one was forced to make an emergency landing
following a loss of cabin pressure. Boeing fell 0.7 percent to
$73.47.  To contact the reporter on this story:
