Euro-region leaders plan to decide
on a successor to European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  in late June, finance ministers said.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government will decide on
its preferred candidate shortly before a summit in Brussels on
June 24, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said today. His
Spanish counterpart Elena Salgado said that “even if we need to
speed up decisions, we will arrive to one in June.”  “Finance ministers will have to make a proposal and the
European Council will decide,” Schaeuble told reporters after a
two-day meeting of European Union finance ministers and central
bank governors in Godollo, Hungary. “The federal government has
decided to form its opinion close to that date.”  The resignation of Bundesbank President  Axel Weber ,
previously named by economists as the frontrunner to succeed
Trichet, opened up the race for the ECB’s top job to candidates
from Italy’s  Mario Draghi  to Luxembourg’s Yves Mersch.  Ireland’s  Paddy Power Plc (PAP)  is  offering  odds of 4 to 6 on
Draghi getting the job, followed by Germany’s Klaus Regling and
Mersch. Trichet will retire in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
