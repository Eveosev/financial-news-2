French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said European Union finance officials “had a good
discussion” about taxation as Ireland pledged to resist calls
to increase its corporate levy.  “We had a good discussion about the general taxation
landscape and agreed that we should be discussing it further,”
Lagarde told reporters in Godollo,  Hungary , today after a
meeting with European counterparts. “There’s willingness on
both sides to discuss.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy are pressing Ireland to consider raising it’s
12.5 percent corporate tax, which is among the lowest in the EU,
in return for a reduction of the country’s bailout rate. Irish
Finance Minister  Michael Noonan , who held private meetings with
both Lagarde and German counterpart  Wolfgang Schaeuble , said
it’s a “vital interest” to maintain the levy.  “There’s no question of any concession on the corporate
tax rate being made by Ireland,” he said. “We’ll explore
alternatives. As relationships build up a better understanding
emerges of what our vital interests are.”  The European Commission has proposed a single method for
calculating income to save companies the cost of complying with
different rules in each EU country where they file a return. Tax
rates would remain in national hands under the draft law on a
common consolidated corporate tax base, which the commission
says would save companies 700 million euros ($1 billion) a year
in compliance costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
