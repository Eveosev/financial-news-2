Moscow’s largest airport Domodedovo
delayed flights today including those to Washington, London and
Tel-Aviv as heavy snow hit the Russian capital.  At least 30 domestic and international flights were delayed
as of 1 p.m. Moscow time, according to information on the
Domodedovo website. It wasn’t immediately clear how many people
were affected.  “The main reason cited for the delay is de-icing of the
aircraft,” a Domodedovo hotline operator who only identified
herself as Natalya, said by phone today. Domodedovo spokeswomen
Elena Galanova and Marina Motornaya didn’t pick up calls to
their mobile phones.  Moscow got more than a third of April’s normal
precipitation today, Interfax reported, citing the city’s
meteorological service. About 500 trees fell under the weight of
wet snow, the Russian news service said. The snowfall
complicated traffic and left 3,000 people without electricity in
the Moscow region.  Flights from cross-town Sheremetyevo airport are on
schedule, according to spokesman Roman Genis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
