The more the European Central Bank
raises  interest rates , the more “room for manoeuvre” it gives
the  Swiss National Bank , Finanz & Wirtschaft reported, citing
 UBS AG (UBSN)  Chief Economist Andreas Hoefert.  Higher interest rates in the eurozone allow the SNB to
raise borrowing costs in Switzerland without the Swiss franc
becoming “too strong,” Hoefert said in an interview in today’s
 newspaper . Swiss exports aren’t likely to suffer if the franc
remains strong, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
