WinWinD Oy , a Finnish wind-turbine
maker backed by Abu Dhabi’s state renewable energy company,
plans to sell its new 3-megawatt turbine in  India  by the end of
2012.  WinWinD may also consider manufacturing the turbine in
Asia’s largest wind market after  China , R. Narayan Kumar, chief
executive officer of the company’s Indian unit, said in an
interview in Chennai today.  The company currently makes 1-megawatt turbines at its
plant in Vengal in the southern Indian state of  Tamil Nadu . The
facility can produce up to 1,000 turbines a year and is
currently operating at 30 percent capacity, he said.  Haminan Energia Oy , a Finnish utility, and Jari Sillanpaa,
a Finnish singer, have placed orders for the first prototypes of
the WinWinD 3 to be delivered later this year, said Farhan
Mirza, WinWinD’s global head of purchasing. Cursor Oy, a Finnish
developer, also plans to use the model at the 30-turbine
Virolahti wind park, according to WinWinD’s  website .  Abu Dhabi ’s Masdar paid 120 million euros ($173 million) to
acquire an undisclosed stake in WinWinD in September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
