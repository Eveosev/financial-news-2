The death toll after a shooting
incident at a Dutch shopping mall has been raised to seven, the
city of Alphen aan den Rijn  said  on its website.  The dead includes the gunman, mayor Bas Eenhoorn told a
press conference. He described today’s shootings, in which 16
other people were injured, as a “disaster.”  Dutch Queen Beatrix expressed her compassion with the
victims and their families, in a statement issued by her press
department on Twitter.  The shooting, at the main entrance and promenade of the
“Ridderhof” mall in Alphen aan den Rijn, a city 13 miles (21
kilometers) south-west of Amsterdam with a population of about
72,670, happened around noon.  The Dutch gunman was armed with a machine gun and appeared
to be shooting at random, broadcaster NOS said, citing a witness
identified as Maart Verbeek.  “There was a panic in the mall, a lot of people running,”
Verbeek told NOS. The gunman had “a big machine gun,” he said.  Of those wounded, four are in a critical condition and five
are in a serious condition, Eenhoorn said.  “For the people who were there, including parents with
children, what happened there is very hard to understand,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
