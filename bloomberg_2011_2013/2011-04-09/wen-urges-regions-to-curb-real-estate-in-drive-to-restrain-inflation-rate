Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  asked
local governments to take responsibility to keep housing
affordable and said stabilizing consumer prices in the country
is the top priority.  The central government’s aim to control the property market
is “clear” and the determination is “firm,” Wen said during
a visit to eastern  China ’s Zhejiang province, according to a
statement on the government’s  web site  today.  The Chinese government is intensifying efforts to curb
speculation in the real-estate market after housing prices
gained for 19 consecutive months through December. Consumer
prices in February climbed 4.9 percent from a year earlier,
exceeding the government’s annual inflation target of 4 percent.  China’s economy is “generally doing well” and the
stability of macro-economic policies will be maintained, Wen
said. The country will adopt measures including on the reserve
ratio,  interest rates  and the  exchange rate  to support the real
economy, he said.  China raised the one-year deposit rate to 3.25 percent from
3 percent on April 5, the fourth time since October.  The government will also maintain stable growth of foreign
trade and optimize the structure of imports and exports, Wen
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
