European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  urged governments to ensure they have
financial backstops in place to shore up banks that fail this
year’s Europe-wide stress tests.  “We need very, very robust and credible stress tests and
also all the backstops that would be necessary,” Trichet, told
reporters today in Godollo,  Hungary , after a meeting of European
finance officials. Governments have to “stand ready to do what
is necessary,” Trichet said.  European regulators will use a tougher measure of capital
on 90 lenders in this year’s stress tests following criticism
last year’s weren’t stringent enough. Banks will be expected to
maintain a Core Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 5 percent under
the stress-test scenarios, the European Banking Authority, which
is coordinating the tests, said on its  website  on April 8. The
EBA is due to announce the results by the end of June.  The definition of capital for the tests is “rigorous and
realistic, and will show who is stronger and who is less
stronger in the European banking sector,” Economic and Monetary
Commissioner Olli Rehn said.  Rehn echoed Trichet’s call for governments to put in place
measures to aid any banks that fail the tests. “It’s very
important” that governments have “the necessary financial
backstops to support restructuring and recapitalization,” Rehn
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
