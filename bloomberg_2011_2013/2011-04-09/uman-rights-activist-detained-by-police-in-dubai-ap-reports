A human rights activist and blogger
was detained by police in Dubai after allegedly receiving death
threats for signing a petition demanding changes to the
constitution, the  Associated Press  reported.  Ahmed Mansour was arrested yesterday after 10 police
officers entered his Dubai home, searched the house and seized
documents and two laptops, according to the report, which cited
Mansour’s wife, Nadia. The online petition called for changes
that would allow members of the Federal National Council, an
advisory body to the government, to be elected.  Officials at the Dubai government and police weren’t
immediately available for comment as Saturday is a weekend in
the United Arab Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
