Portuguese President Anibal  Cavaco Silva  called for an “interim” financial package for his
country and said the government that wins June elections should
hammer out the details of a final aid program.  “I hope our partners will take into consideration that we
are moving toward elections,” Cavaco Silva told reporters today
in Budapest. “What we need now is an interim program so the
next government can participate in the final negotiations
because it is the next government that is going to implement the
program.”  European Union finance ministers agreed yesterday to send
European Commission,  European Central Bank  and International
Monetary Fund officials to Lisbon next week to start
negotiations over an aid package for Portugal, with the goal of
wrapping up an agreement on May 16, three weeks before the
country’s June 5 election.  Caretaker Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates said on
April 6 that the government would seek an EU-led rescue package
as the nation braces for 9 billion euros ($13 billion) in bond
maturities in April and June, which come at a time of surging
financing costs.  “We need, let’s say, some imagination” from the EU in
granting aid, Cavaco Silva said today.  Portugal ’s main political parties have agreed on the goals
for deficit cuts through 2013 and understand that the elections
must result in a majority government in parliament, Cavaco Silva
said. “That is the most important message.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
