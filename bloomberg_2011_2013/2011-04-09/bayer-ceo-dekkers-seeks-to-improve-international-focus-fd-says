Bayer AG (BAYN)  must be a more
internationally minded company and make decisions quicker, Chief
Executive Officer Marijn Dekkers said in an interview with Dutch
paper Het Financieele Dagblad.  Dekkers, who took over as CEO in October, said most company
decisions are made in  Germany , where Bayer is based. This could
improve if decision making is moved to a local level, he said.  Editors: Andrew Reierson, Christiane Lenzner  To contact the reporter on this story:
