(Corrects to say only one company has halted promotions.)  One real estate agency has stopped
promoting Egyptian billionaire Samih Sawiris’s development in
Andermatt,  Switzerland , Tages-Anzeiger said, citing the agent.  Sawiris’s Andermatt Swiss Alps in October took over the
running of the showroom in Zurich for the development from Walde
& Partner and Ginesta Immobilien, the  newspaper  said, citing
spokeswoman Sandra Hrovat. She said that it’s easier if the
company runs the showroom on its own. Tages-Anzeiger cited
Gerhard Walde as saying his company no longer promotes sales.  Hrovat told Bloomberg News that more than 50 agents are
still promoting sales internationally, and the company is
negotiating more contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
