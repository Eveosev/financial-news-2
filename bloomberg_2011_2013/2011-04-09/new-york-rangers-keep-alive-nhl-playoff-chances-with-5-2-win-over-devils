The  New York Rangers  beat the New
Jersey Devils 5-2 in their final game of the National Hockey
League regular season to keep alive their chances of reaching
the playoffs.  The Rangers had to avoid a loss in regulation play at
Madison Square Garden in  New York  to prevent the Carolina
Hurricanes claiming the eighth and final playoff spot in the
Eastern Conference.  New York has 93 points and Carolina has 91 points. The
Hurricanes host the Tampa Bay Lightning in their final regular-
season game tonight. Carolina holds the tiebreaker over the
Rangers and will advance to the postseason at New Yorkâ€™s expense
with a win.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
