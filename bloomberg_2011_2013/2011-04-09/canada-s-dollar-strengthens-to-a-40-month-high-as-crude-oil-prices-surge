Canada ’s dollar strengthened to the
highest level against its U.S. counterpart since November 2007
as commodities including crude oil, the nation’s biggest export,
surged amid optimism global economic growth is accelerating.  The currency gained for the third straight week as oil
exceeded $112 a barrel on concern Libyan output won’t rebound
when fighting ends in that divided nation. Gold surged to a
record. The  Bank of Canada  is expected to keep its target
interest rate at 1 percent when policy makers meet next week.  “When commodity prices are up,  oil prices  are up and
equity markets rally, the risk-on benefits the Canadian
dollar,” said Rahim Madhavji, president at Knightsbridge
Foreign Exchange Inc. in Toronto.  The dollar, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, appreciated 0.8 percent to 95.54
cents per  U.S. dollar  yesterday in Toronto, from 96.32 cents on
April 1. It touched 95.27 cents yesterday, the strongest level
since Nov. 15, 2007. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0467.  The loonie has strengthened 9.3 percent since June, and is
approaching the strongest levels since it was allowed to float
in 1950. The currency touched 90.58 cents on Nov. 7, 2007, as
the collapse of the U.S. subprime-mortgage market disrupted
financial markets and weakened the U.S. dollar.  Government bonds  fell for a third week. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year security climbed 8 basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 3.44 percent. Two-year note yields rose 7
basis points to 1.90 percent, also the third consecutive weekly
increase.  Asset Prices  Crude oil for May delivery increased 4.5 percent last week
to $112.79 a barrel in New York, the highest level since
September 2008. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of  raw materials 
climbed 2.2 percent in its third consecutive weekly gain, and
gold advanced 3.2 percent. Raw materials including oil and gold
account for about half of Canada’s export revenue.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index has climbed 5.7
percent this year as the Canadian economy expands and the U.S.
Federal Reserve encourages investors to seek higher yielding
assets elsewhere by keeping borrowing rates at a record low
range of zero to 0.25 percent.  “Equity markets are up, the U.S. dollar is weak and
commodities are booming, which is a formula for Canadian dollar
strength,” said Steven Englander, head of Group of 10 currency
strategy at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “Canada’s data numbers
are the second story.”  Canada unexpectedly lost jobs in March for the first time
in six months as a record drop in part-time work outstripped the
biggest gain in full-time positions in a year. Employment fell
by 1,500, following gains of 15,100 and 69,200 in the prior two
months,  Statistics Canada  said yesterday.  Interest Rate Expectations  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against six of its major trading partners
including the Canadian dollar, fell to as low as 74.855
yesterday, the least since December 2009.  The Bank of Canada, which led the Group of Seven nations
with three interest-rate increases last year, is expected to
keep its benchmark at 1 percent, according to the weighted
average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 25 economists.  The central bank, which meets April 12, has kept its
benchmark at 1 percent since September. Policy makers reiterated
on March 1 that “considerable slack” remains in the economy.
Exporters face “considerable challenges” from a  currency
trading  at a more than a three-year high, they said.  ‘Interest to Diversify’  Canada’s trade ties to the U.S. have fallen to the lowest
since at least 1986, extending a slide between the world’s
largest commercial partners, Statistics Canada said.  About 62.5 percent of Canada’s foreign merchandise trade
was with the U.S. in 2010, down from 76.3 percent in 2001, the
Ottawa-based agency said in an annual review April 7. Canada’s
share of trade with  China  tripled to 3.3 percent from 1.1
percent during that time, while trade with the U.K. rose to 4.1
percent from 1.3 percent.  “Canada is a large commodity producer and it’s in their
interest to diversify,” said  Kathy Lien , director of currency
research with online currency trader GFT Forex in  New York .
“Overall, all signs point to that Canada isn’t as reliant on
the U.S. these days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
