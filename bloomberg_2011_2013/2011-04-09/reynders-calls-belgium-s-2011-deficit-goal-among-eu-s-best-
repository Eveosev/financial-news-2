Belgium is on course to narrow its
 budget deficit  to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product this
year from 4.1 percent in 2010, said Finance Minister  Didier Reynders , who called the step “one of the best” in Europe.  Belgium is reducing its spending gap while in a state of
political limbo as the European Union prepares financial aid for
Portugal following last year’s rescue packages for Greece and
Ireland. A split between Belgium’s Dutch-speaking northern
region and francophone south after elections last June has left
the country with a caretaker government.  “We don’t have any problem for the moment,” Reynders told
reporters at a meeting of EU finance ministers today in Godollo,
Hungary. “We have taken all the measures to have one of the
best results in Europe about the fiscal situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
