President Barack Obama’s
administration doesn’t have a specific timetable for completing
a proposal for winding down  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  and
bringing private capital back into the housing market, Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan said today.  “We have continued to work on refining potential proposals
for the GSEs,” Donovan told lawmakers at a Senate Banking
Committee hearing in Washington. “We’ve been encouraged to see
bipartisan legislative proposals.”  The administration has made “significant” strides toward
bringing private capital back into the housing market without
action from Congress, Donovan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
