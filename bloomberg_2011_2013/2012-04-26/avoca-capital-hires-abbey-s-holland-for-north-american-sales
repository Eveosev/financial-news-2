Avoca Capital Holdings, a Dublin-
based credit manager overseeing 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion),
hired Stephen Holland from Abbey Capital Ltd. as director of
sales and marketing focusing on  North America .  “The changing European credit market dynamics brought
about by the diminishing role of banks presents a number of
opportunities which are finding interest among investors outside
of  Europe ,” Chief Operating Officer Clayton Perry said in an e-
mailed statement. “Avoca has seen increasing interest and
demand from institutional investors in [North America] for the
significant return and diversification opportunities available
through the credit markets in Europe.”  Holland was most recently business development manager in
charge of sales for the $4 billion Abbey Capital hedge fund in
Dublin, and previously worked for Bank of Ireland Asset
Management (U.S.) Ltd., spending 13 years working in North
America, the company said in the statement.  Avoca hired Vaibhav Piplapure from Credit Suisse Group AG
in February to head its structured and illiquid credit unit,
managing allocations to Avoca’s 500 million-euro credit
opportunities fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
