German credit conditions eased for
a fourth month in April as banks became more willing to lend,
the  Ifo research institute  said, citing a survey.  The share of companies that consider banksâ€™ credit policies
to be restrictive fell to 19.5 percent from 20.3 percent in
March, Munich-based Ifo said in a statement today. It surveyed
about 4,000 companies for its monthly report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
