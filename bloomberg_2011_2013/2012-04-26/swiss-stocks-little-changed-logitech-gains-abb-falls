Swiss stocks  fell for the first
time in three days after reports showed that economic confidence
in the euro area dropped and more Americans than forecast
applied for  unemployment benefits .  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the largest power-grid supplier, lost 2.3 percent
after CA Cheuvreux and JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered their
recommendations on the stock.  Straumann Holding AG (STMN) , the biggest
maker of dental implants, slid as first-quarter sales missed
analyst estimates.  Logitech (LOGN)  International SA, the biggest maker
of computer mice, surged the most since 2007 as fourth-quarter
net income increased ninefold.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  declined 0.5 percent to 6,122.41 at
the close in Zurich. The measure has still rallied 3.1 percent
so far this year as U.S. economic reports beat forecasts and the
 European Central Bank  increased long-term lending to the
region’s financial institutions. The broader Swiss Performance
Index slipped 0.2 percent today.  “Investors aren’t letting the continuing stress factors,
like the European debt crisis, out of their sight,” said
 Manfred Hofer , senior investment analyst at LGT Capital
Management AG in Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland . “Confidence in the
markets has yet to be restored. All in all, it’s a balanced
situation. A sideways movement with strong fluctuations can be
expected in the next few days.”  Economic Confidence  An  index  of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area fell to 92.8 this month from a revised 94.5 in
March, the European Commission said today. Economists had
projected a drop to 94.2 from a previously reported 94.4,
according to the median of 29 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Italy’s borrowing costs jumped at the sale of 8.5 billion
euros ($11.3 billion) of six-month bills as renewed concern
about the spread of the region’s debt crisis forced the Treasury
to offer higher rates to attract investors.  The Treasury sold the debt at a rate of 1.772 percent, up
from 1.119 percent at the previous auction on March 28.  In the U.S., a Labor Department report showed that more
Americans than forecast filed  initial jobless claims  last week.
Unemployment claims dropped to 388,000 from a revised 389,000 a
week earlier. The median forecast of 48 economists had called
for a reading of 375,000.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled that
further stimulus is unlikely unless the economy unexpectedly
deteriorates. Still, central bankers “remain prepared to do
more” if conditions worsen, he said.  ABB, Credit Suisse  ABB declined 2.3 percent to 17.38 Swiss francs after CA
Cheuvreux downgraded the company’s shares to underperform, the
equivalent of sell, from outperform. JPMorgan cut the stock to
neutral, the equivalent of hold, from overweight. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. removed the stock from its conviction buy list.  Straumann lost 2.1 percent to 147.70 francs after reporting
sales of 185 million francs compared with the average 188.6
million-franc analyst estimate.  Rival Nobel Biocare Holding AG, which is due to report
results tomorrow, slipped 2.1 percent to 10.70 francs.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s second-biggest bank,
dropped 3.8 percent to 22.10 francs for the biggest decline on
the SMI. The shares slid 2.5 percent yesterday as the company
reported declining profit.  UBS AG (UBSN)  fell 0.5 percent to 11.39 francs and  Swiss Life
Holding AG (SLHN)  slipped 0.5 percent to 93.10 francs.  Logitech rallied 17 percent to 8.28 francs, the largest
gain since October 2007. The company cut a layer of management
to help save $80 million a year and said net income in the
quarter ended March rose to $28 million from $3 million a year
earlier. Revenue fell 3 percent to $532 million. Analysts
expected profit of $12.4 million and sales of $528.8 million,
according to the averages of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
