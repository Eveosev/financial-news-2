Aygaz AS (AYGAZ) , a Turkish liquefied gas
company, dropped in Istanbul after the country’s asset sales
agency said it will cancel the sale of Ankara’s gas grid company
for which Aygaz was among the bidders.  The shares fell 1 percent, the most in almost a week, to
8.20 liras at the close in Istanbul.  Turkey ’s asset sales agency said it will cancel the sale of
an 80 percent stake in Baskent Dogalgaz Dagitim AS, known as
Baskentgaz, after bidders including Aygaz didn’t meet a
government price demand of $626 million, Ahmet Aksu, acting
chairman of the agency and head of the auction committee, said
in Ankara today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
