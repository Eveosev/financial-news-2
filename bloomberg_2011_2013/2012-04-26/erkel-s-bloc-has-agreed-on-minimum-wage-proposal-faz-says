Lawmakers from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s  Christian Democratic Union  and its Christian Social
Union Bavarian sister party have agreed on a proposal to
introduce a minimum wage in  Germany ,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported.  A commission of employer and labor-union representatives
would set minimum wages for sectors of the economy in which pay
agreements by employers and unions don’t exist, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Exceptions may be made for certain regions or business
sectors under the proposal, the newspaper said. Wages agreed by
employers and unions that are below the minimum would remain in
effect, the newspaper said.  Merkel’s bloc will start negotiations with its Free
Democratic Party coalition ally, which rejects a minimum wage,
to turn the proposal into law before the 2013 election, FAZ
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
