U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu
said tightening efficiency rules on appliances and industry
could eliminate the need to build 200 new power stations.  Speaking at the conclusion of a clean energy ministers
meeting in  London , the Cabinet minister said work on appliance
and equipment standards around the world could save up to 600
terawatt hours of electricity use.  “The time to act is now because it will take substantial
shouldering to the wheel,” Chu said. “It will take some time
to turn a great ship. The acceleration of green technologies can
save consumers money and create growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
