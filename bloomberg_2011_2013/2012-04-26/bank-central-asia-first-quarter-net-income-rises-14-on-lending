PT Bank Central Asia (BBCA) ,  Indonesia ’s
largest financial services company by market value, posted a
14.3 percent gain in first-quarter profit from a year earlier
driven by increased loan demand.  Net income  at the Jakarta-based bank rose to 2.3 trillion
rupiah ($250 million) in the three months ending March 31, from
2 trillion rupiah the same period a year earlier, the lender
said in a statement released in Jakarta today.  Indonesia’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at a record-low 5.75 percent for two straight months,
helping commercial banks to boost lending in Southeast Asia
largest economy, which is driven mostly by  consumer spending .  Bank Central Asia’s lending grew 39 percent to 209.2
trillion rupiah supported by a “favorable economic
environment,” and corporate and consumer loans, according to
the statement.  Net interest income, or the difference between revenue from
loans and payments to depositors, rose 16 percent to 4.47
