A Bulgarian military aircraft
MiG-29 crashed during a training flight near the southern city
of Plovdiv without casualties.  The plane caught fire shortly after takeoff from the Graf
Ignatievo air force base, the  Defense Ministry  in Sofia said in
a statement today. Its two pilots were instructed to direct the
aircraft toward an unpopulated area and eject. The MiG-29 fell
between the villages of Tsarimir and Goliam Chardak and there
are no civilian casualties, the ministry said.  Defense Minister Anyu Angelov and emergency crews are at
the crash site. The two pilots were rescued by helicopter and
taken to hospital, where one was diagnosed with back injuries.  “We are lucky there are no casualties,” Angelov told
reporters today. “The cause of the accident is being
investigated and airforce flights are canceled.”  The Soviet-era aircraft was training for an exercise with
the 31st U.S. Air Force Squadron based in  Aviano ,  Italy , planned
for April 29. The exercise was canceled after the crash, the
ministry said.  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest state in terms of
per-capita economic output, has delayed plans to purchase new
military aircraft needed to meet North Atlantic Treaty
Organization requirements. Bulgaria joined NATO in 2004.  Bulgaria has 15 MiG-29 fighters, which it plans to use
until their service life expires in 2029. Its military fleet
also includes Soviet-era MiG-21 and SU-25 fighters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
