The  London  Olympic organizers cut
their carbon-emission forecast for staging the event by a fifth
after scaling back the size of venues and renting rather than
building seats, tents and crowd barriers.  The so-called carbon footprint of the games, which begin on
July 27, will be equivalent to 315,000 metric tons of carbon
dioxide, the London Organizing Committee of the  Olympic Games 
said today in an e-mailed report. That’s a decline of more than
20 percent from the 400,000 tons  estimated  in March 2010.  London pledged to put sustainability at the heart of the
games when it won the bid to host the Olympics seven years ago.
While the organizers have met targets for waste recycling and
reuse, they’ve struggled to achieve goals for renewable-energy
output and power consumption, and in 2009 ended a plan to offset
emissions from the games by investing in clean energy abroad.  The bulk of the emission reductions detailed in today’s
report stem from a decision to rent temporary seating, barriers
and other infrastructure rather than buy them new. The
organizers also cut 90,000 square meters (969,000 square feet)
of floor space in venues, saving 15,000 tons of CO2, they said.  Energy use in venues “proved to be particularly
challenging,” the committee said in the report. “London 2012
has managed to find alternative solutions that ultimately are
leading to better outcomes in terms of carbon reductions, even
if not by the original means envisaged.”  Waste Targets  The Olympic Delivery Authority, responsible for building
the venues, reused or recycled more than 98 percent of the waste
from demolishing warehouses and other structures already on the
games site, beating a 90 percent target. About 99 percent of the
waste created when building the venues was reused or recycled.  The Olympic Park will get about 11 percent of its energy
from renewable sources including solar panels, biomass boilers
and small  wind turbines , the committee said. The original 20
percent target was stymied in 2010 when organizers canceled
plans for a 2-megawatt wind turbine at the site.  Rather than develop more renewable generation at the park,
organizers said they’ve invested in more cost-effective energy
efficiency measures in 2,800 local homes and 12 schools,
compensating for the shortfall.  Today’s carbon report relates only to those emissions
generated by staging the games. The total volume of  greenhouse
gases  associated with the event over the seven years of site-
clearing and construction was estimated in 2010 at 3.45 million
tons of CO2. That compares with total U.K. emissions of 549.3
million tons in 2011, according to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
