Government departments need to plan
better to minimize the impact of the austerity program being
imposed by the Treasury, Britain’s spending watchdog said.  “Departments need to do better at planning their finances
logically, understanding the relationship between costs and
outcomes better and not going for the easy option which could
most damage front-line services,”  Margaret Hodge , the Labour
lawmaker who heads Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, said
in a statement in London today.  Hodge praised departments’ 2.3 percent spending cut in the
fiscal year that ended in March last year, while highlighting
the difficulty of making a further reduction of 19 percent by
2015.  The National Audit Office, the government spending
watchdog, said in February that ministries don’t fully
understand the costs and risks involved and that “fundamental
changes” will be required to achieve the cuts.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is aiming to
eliminate most of a  budget deficit  equal to 8 percent of gross
domestic product by 2017. The unprecedented squeeze will see
more than 700,000 government jobs axed. The opposition  Labour
Party  say the cuts are responsible for pushing Britain back into
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
