The most senior civil servant in
Culture Secretary  Jeremy Hunt ’s department refused to tell
lawmakers if he’d authorized Hunt’s adviser, who quit yesterday
over his contacts with  News Corp. (NWSA) , to talk to the company.  Under repeated questioning, Jonathan Stephens said he
wouldn’t add to or comment on Hunt’s statement that he had given
the green light to Adam Smith, a political appointee, to be the
point of contact for News Corp. as Hunt considered its bid for
the remainder of  British Sky Broadcasting Plc. (BSY)   Smith resigned after e-mails were published showing News
Corp. had advance knowledge of Hunt’s decisions. Hunt, fighting
calls for his resignation, told lawmakers he hadn’t known the
extent of Smith’s contacts with a News Corp. lobbyist.  “It seemed to me extremely odd to be told that you had
agreed as permanent secretary to enable a special adviser to act
as a channel of communications,” Public Accounts Committee
chairwoman  Margaret Hodge  told Stephens. “Is that true?”  “The secretary of state made a full statement to
Parliament yesterday,” said Stephens, who was appearing before
the panel to give evidence on the Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
