Kenya ’s shilling appreciated
against the dollar for the second trading day on inflows of
foreign funds to buy government debt.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy strengthened
0.2 percent to 83.15 per dollar by 2:47 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, after depreciating as much as 0.1 percent to 83.37.  “The bond inflows are helping support the shilling,”
Julius Kiriinya, currency trader with Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp. said in a phone interview.  Kenya accepted 6.5 billion shillings ($78 million) in bids
for two-year Treasury bonds, more than the 5 billion shillings
it had put on offer, in a sale that was more than six times
oversubscribed, the Nairobi-based central bank said yesterday.
The central bank accepted 2.7 billion shillings of 182-day
Treasury bills on the same day, after it had offered 2 billion
of the securities.  The Uganda currency strengthened 0.2 percent to 2,504.50
per dollar, while Tanzania’s declined 0.3 percent to 1,590.  To contact the reporter on this story:
