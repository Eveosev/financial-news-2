The Atlantic will have an average
 hurricane season  this year, with 12 named storms, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.   AccuWeather’s outlook is more robust than those of several
other forecasters, including Colorado State University
researchers, who have called for a below-average year with 10 to
11 storms. The typical June 1 to Nov. 30 season produces 12
systems with winds of at least 39 miles (63 kilometers) per
hour, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.  Atlantic weather is closely watched because the storms are
a threat to oil and natural gas interests in the  Gulf of Mexico 
and agriculture in the South. The Gulf accounts for 29 percent
of U.S. oil output and 40 percent of refining capacity, while
 Florida  is the second-largest citrus producer behind Brazil.  State College , Pennsylvania-based AccuWeather predicts five
storms will become hurricanes with winds of at least 74 mph and
two will grow into major systems with winds of 111 mph or more.  “Another big storm is possible for the East Coast with
heavy, flooding rain,”  Paul Pastelok , lead long-range
forecaster for the company, said in a statement.  Earlier this month, Colorado State predicted 10 named
storms would form in 2012. Weather Service International
yesterday joined MDA EarthSat Weather and Commodity Weather
Group LLC in forecasting 11 storms.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will
release its seasonal forecast next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
