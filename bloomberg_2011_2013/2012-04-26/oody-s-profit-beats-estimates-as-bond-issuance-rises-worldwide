Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , the world’s second-
largest provider of credit ratings, said first-quarter profit
rose 12 percent as global bond sales accelerated.  Net income increased to $173.5 million, or 76 cents a
share, from $155.5 million, or 67 cents, a year earlier, New
York-based Moody’s said today in a statement distributed by
 Business Wire . The average forecast of six analysts in a
Bloomberg  survey  was for earnings of 69 cents.  Moody’s profits have climbed over the past two years as
companies around the world take advantage of near-zero  interest
rates  to issue more bonds, boosting demand for its credit
ratings. Corporate bond issuance worldwide rose 10 percent to
$1.17 trillion in the first quarter from $1.06 trillion a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “While the level of activity was strong in the first
quarter, we remain cautious about market conditions for the
remainder of the year,” Ray McDaniel, Moody’s chief executive
officer, said in the statement. The company’s earnings for 2012
will probably be at the “upper end” of $2.62 to $2.72 a share,
he said.  The company said revenue increased 12 percent to $646.8
million for the quarter, from $577.1 million in the
corresponding period of 2011. Its credit-rating unit accounted
for $452.7 million of the total, a jump of 10 percent from last
year.  Housing’s Earnings Toll  Moody’s full-year profit of $571.4 million for 2011 was an
increase of 42 percent from two years earlier. Annual earnings
peaked at $753.9 million in 2006, before the collapse of the
housing market all but halted issuance of the complex mortgage-
backed securities that banks pay the company to evaluate.  Revenue at  Standard & Poor’s , the largest credit-ratings
company, rose 5 percent to $466 million in the first quarter,
the New York-based unit of McGraw-Hill Cos. announced on April
24.  Moody’s shares have climbed 17 percent in the past year to
$41.97 as of yesterday.  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
is the company’s biggest  shareholder , with a 13 percent stake
worth about $1.2 billion, Bloomberg data show.  (Moody’s will hold a conference call for analysts and
