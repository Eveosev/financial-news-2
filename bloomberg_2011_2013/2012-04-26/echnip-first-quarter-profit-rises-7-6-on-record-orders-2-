Technip SA (TEC) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, reported a 7.6 percent gain in
first-quarter profit and record orders as energy producers seek
to develop new reserves.  Net income  rose to 112.2 million euros ($148.4 million)
from 104.3 million euros a year earlier, Paris-based Technip
said today in a statement. Sales jumped 23 percent to 1.76
billion euros.  Rising oil prices spurred exploration spending in the
quarter, raising demand for Technip’s products such as flexible
offshore pipelines. The company last month announced its biggest
U.K.  North Sea  contract, an order to develop and install subsea
infrastructure for the Quad 204 project at the Schiehallion
field west of Shetland.  “The most striking aspect of the quarter was our very
strong order intake,” Chief Executive Officer Thierry Pilenko
said in the statement. “We continue to see a favorable
orientation of our industry as operators’ investment plans
remain very ambitious.”  The company said its order backlog reached a record 12.3
billion euros at the end of March, compared with 10.4 billion
euros at the end of 2011. The quarterly order intake was 3.31
billion euros, more than double the 1.29 billion euros a year
earlier.  ‘Mammoth’ Backlog  Technip’s “mammoth” backlog in the subsea division is
already close to expectations for the year, Kepler Capital
Markets analyst  Bertrand Hodee  wrote in a report. Guidance for
the division “could already look conservative.”  The shares, which have risen 18 percent this year, fell 2.4
percent to 87.03 euros as of 1:30 p.m. in Paris.  “Technip shares are not cheap,” Canaccord Genuity
analysts including James Evans wrote in a note. Still, the
results were positive and the company’s profit outlook could be
revised higher, they said.  The oil-services company expects more projects will be
started by  oil companies  to maintain and upgrade Norwegian and
U.K. fields in the North Sea to extend their operating lives,
Pilenko said today on a conference call. Other promising
projects for Technip could be liquefied natural gas
installations in  East Africa  as well as floating LNG platforms.  Technip confirmed full-year financial  targets  published in
February. It’s seeking revenue of 7.65 billion to 8 billion
euros in 2012, with a subsea operating margin of 15 percent and
a margin for onshore-offshore of 6 percent to 7 percent.  The subsea margin was 14.7 percent in the first quarter,
compared with 16.8 percent a year earlier. The combined onshore-
offshore margin was 6.6 percent, down from 7.4 percent.  Europe’s largest oilfield-services company is  Saipem SpA (SPM) ,
which reported 3.1 billion euros of contracts awarded in the
first quarter, bringing its total backlog to 20.42 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
