Cia. Hering (HGTX3) ’s first quarter profit
beat analysts’ estimates as the company’s stores expansion
helped increase sales.  Net income rose 38 percent to 70.2 million reais ($37.3
million) from 51.02 million reais a year earlier, the Blumenau-
based company said yesterday in a statement sent to the website
of Brazil’s securities regulator. The result was above the 67.3
million reais average estimate of five analysts compiled by
Bloomberg.  Net sales went up 18 percent to 277.7 million reais as the
Hering opened 88 stores in Brazil since the year-earlier period,
the company said. The company plans to open 95 stores this year.  Hering  fell  1.4 percent, to 44.96 reais today in the São
Paulo trading. The stock is up 39 percent since the beginning of
the year, compared to a 8.8 percent gain for the  Bovespa (IBOV) 
benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
