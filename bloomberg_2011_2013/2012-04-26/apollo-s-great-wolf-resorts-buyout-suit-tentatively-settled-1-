An investor lawsuit challenging
fairness of  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) ’s planned $740 million
buyout of water park operator Great Wolf Resorts Inc. was
tentatively settled in exchange for additional information about
the deal, according to court papers.  Investors had claimed executives of Madison, Wisconsin-
based Great Wolf didn’t seriously seek higher bids and that New
York-based Apollo’s $5-a-share cash offer in March, later raised
to $7.85 a share, was inadequate.  “Great Wolf has agreed to make certain supplemental
disclosures” to shareholders and “to negotiate in good faith”
a final settlement agreement, subject to approval of Delaware
Chancery Court Judge John W. Noble, according to papers made
public today in Wilmington.  Great Wolf owns, manages and licenses family resorts
featuring indoor water parks, suite-style rooms, restaurants,
spas and arcades. The company started its first Great Wolf Lodge
in  Wisconsin  Dells, Wisconsin, in 1997, and the chain has since
expanded into eight other U.S. states and  Canada .  Private-equity firm KSL Capital Partners LLC engaged in a
bidding war with Apollo over Great Wolf until it curtailed bids
April 20.  The case is In re  Great Wolf Resorts Inc. (WOLF)  Shareholder
Litigation, CA7328, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
