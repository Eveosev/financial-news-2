Bloomberg's Emily Chang and Jon 
Erlichman report that Zynga Inc., the No. 1 developer of games 
for social-networking sites, beat analysts' first-quarter 
revenue estimates and raised its forecast for the year as more 
people paid for virtual goods, rather than playing for free. 
They speak on Bloomberg Television's "Bloomberg West." (Source:
