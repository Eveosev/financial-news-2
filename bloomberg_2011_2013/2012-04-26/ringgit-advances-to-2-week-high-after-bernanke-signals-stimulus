The ringgit rose to its strongest
level in almost two weeks after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled the supply of dollars may be boosted to
support the U.S. recovery.  Bernanke said the central bank was prepared to add to its
stimulus if necessary, keeping speculation alive that the Fed
might embark on a third round of asset purchases, a policy known
as quantitative easing. The Fed reiterated its view that
borrowing costs are likely to remain “exceptionally low” at
least through late 2014.  “The possibility of QE3 is still very much on the cards,”
said Chua Hak Bin, an economist at Bank of America Corp. in
Singapore. “This is supportive of monetary conditions and
global growth and will support Asian currencies including the
ringgit.”  The ringgit rose 0.3 percent to 3.0518 per dollar as of
4:26 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , after touching 3.0490, the strongest
since April 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, fell 35 basis points to a one-year low of 5.5
percent.  Government bonds  declined yesterday. The yield on the 3.434
percent notes due August 2014 was little changed at 3.11 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
