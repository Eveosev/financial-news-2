U.S. stock-index futures fell,
signaling the market may snap a two-day advance, after jobless
claims topped economists’ estimates and earnings trailed
projections at Exxon Mobil Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
lost 0.3 percent to 1,382.7 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York .   Jobless claims fell by 1,000 to 388,000 in the week ended
April 21 from a revised 389,000 the prior period that was higher
than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed. The
median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 375,000.  The S&P 500 rallied 1.4 percent yesterday after Apple
Inc.’s earnings almost doubled and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  said he’s prepared to do more to stimulate growth if
needed. The index, which is up 11 percent so far in 2012, is 2
percent below an almost four-year high reached on April 2.   Earnings have beaten analysts’ estimates at 76 percent of
the 231 companies in the  S&P 500  that have released results
since April 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Per-
share profits have grown 9.7 percent for the group, led by a 22
percent increase in technology company earnings.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
