New World Resources Plc (NWR)  gained for
a third day after the U.S. Federal Reserve spurred riskier
assets by signaling it may extend economic stimulus if needed.  The biggest Czech producer of coking coal rose 1 percent to
126.5 koruna by 11:12 a.m. in Prague, adding to a 3 percent gain
in the previous two sessions. NWR outperformed the 14-member  PX (PX) 
equity index, which declined 0.7 percent.  Commodities and emerging-market stocks and currencies rose
after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that central
bankers “remain prepared to do more” to stimulate growth if
conditions worsen for the world’s largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
