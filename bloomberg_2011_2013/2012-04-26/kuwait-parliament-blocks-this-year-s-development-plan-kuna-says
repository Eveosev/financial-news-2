Kuwait’s parliament rejected a bill
that covers the government’s $111 billion four-year development
plan in the 2012-2013 fiscal year, the state news agency  KUNA 
reported.  Lawmakers who blocked the bill yesterday described the plan
as “unrealistic” and criticized the government for lagging in
its implementation of projects, according to KUNA.  The plan, which began in 2010-2011, requires parliamentary
approval for every fiscal year. Minister of State for Planning
and Development Affairs, Fadhel Safar, said “many projects were
accomplished in the first two fiscal years of the plan,” KUNA
said.  Kuwait wants private investors to meet almost half the cost
of the development plan to modernize its oil-based economy. The
investments include increasing oil and gas production,
construction of a metro and rail network, the expansion of the
airport, new power stations, cities, hospitals, roads and a port
on Boubyan Island.  Adel al-Wuqayan, secretary-general of the Supreme Council
for Planning and Development, told parliament a panel was
dealing with “obstacles” facing the plan’s implementation,
KUNA said.  -- Editor:  Chris Peterson   To contact the reporter on this story:
