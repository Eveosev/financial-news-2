Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS) , Poland’s
largest phone company, said first-quarter profit rose 28 percent
on lower amortization and falling cost of debt.  Net income increased to 242 million zloty ($76.6 million)
from 189 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based company
said in a regulatory filing today. That beat the  average
estimate  of 232.9 million zloty by eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Sales fell 3.4 percent to 3.52 billion zloty, driven by a
5.4 percent decline of revenues at the company’s fixed-line
business. At the same time mobile phone services sales increased
0.3 percent.  Telekomunikacja, controlled by  France Telecom SA (FTE) , has seen
revenue decline since 2007 as competition increased and the
domestic regulator forced operators to cut prices. The Warsaw-
based company expects sales to fall by as much as 3 percent in
2012 as the country’s telecommunication watchdog wants to lower
the rates that mobile phone operators charge each other for
calls to their networks.  Profit at the operator, which this month started offering
all services under its parent company’s Orange name, was helped
by lower amortization write-offs that fell 146 million zloty, as
well as by a 23 million-zloty decline of cost of debt, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
