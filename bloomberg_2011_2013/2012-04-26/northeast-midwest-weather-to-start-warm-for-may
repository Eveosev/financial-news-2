May weather will probably start out
warm for the Midwest and Northeast, including  New York City  and
Chicago, according to forecasters.  Average temperatures from Colorado to Massachusetts may
reach 6 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 Celsius) above normal from May 2
to May 6, said  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri.  Salmon forecasts even warmer weather around the Great
Lakes, including Chicago, where average temperatures may be 10
degrees above normal.  Commodities traders watch temperature outlooks and heating-
degree days forecasts to gauge energy use and demand. About 51
percent of U.S. households use gas for heating, according to the
Energy Department, while demand from electricity generators
peaks in the summer months to meet air conditioning needs.  “The models are in good agreement on moderate to much-
above-normal temperatures spreading across the Midwest and East
next week,” said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  The warmer air may shift to the west over the Rocky
Mountains from May 6 to May 10, while more seasonal temperatures
take hold in the Great Lakes and Northeast, Rogers said.  The normal average temperature for April 28 in  New York  is
about 57, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
Maryland. It’s 53 in Boston, 54 in Chicago, 62 in  St. Louis , 66
in Atlanta, 72 in Dallas, 74 in Houston, 53 in Seattle and 64 in
Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
