Chesapeake Energy Corp., whose
board is reviewing Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon’s
financing agreements, had its corporate credit and senior
unsecured debt issue ratings downgraded to BB from BB+ by
 Standard & Poor’s .   McClendon’s agreements related to the company’s founder
well participation program “underscore shortcomings” in the
company’s corporate governance, S&P said in a statement. The
ratings may be cut further, S&P said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
