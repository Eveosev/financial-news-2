The pound rose to the most in more
than seven months against the dollar as investors bet the  Bank
of England  will hold off on extending stimulus after a report
showed consumer confidence rose to the highest since June.  Sterling traded near the strongest in almost two years
against the euro even after a report yesterday showed the U.K.
economy unexpectedly slipped back into recession. A Nationwide
Building Society  index of sentiment  for March climbed to 53,
from 44 in February, adding weight to the argument for a pause
in the central bank’s so-called quantitative-easing program.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday repeated a
plan to keep U.S. borrowing costs low until at least late 2014.  The U.K. currency’s strength stems from “the market moving
to reduce further expectations of QE from the BOE so yield
spreads were moving in the pound’s favor,” said  Lee Hardman , a
foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
in  London . “Markets had largely expected a weak GDP report and
so had the Bank of  England , so they won’t be placing too much
emphasis on it. The upward trend of the last month is still in
place but our view is that trend is not sustainable.”  The pound advanced for a ninth day, its longest gaining
streak since January 2011. It rose 0.2 percent to $1.6188 at
11:10 a.m. London time, after touching $1.6207, the highest
since Sept. 2.  Sterling added 0.2 percent to 81.65 pence per euro. It
appreciated to 81.44 pence on April 24, the strongest level
since Aug. 23, 2010. The U.K. currency traded 0.4 percent higher
at 131.051 yen.  Pound Outlook  The median of eight estimates in a Bloomberg survey
predicted  consumer confidence  would decline to 43. In a separate
report, the British Bankers’ Association said U.K.  mortgage
approvals  fell in March. That’s the lowest in 10 months.  Sterling has climbed 1.7 percent in the past month, the
second-best performer after the yen among the 10 developed-
nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The euro dropped 0.9 percent.  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi estimates the pound will decline
against the dollar and yen as economic fundamentals force the
Bank of England to renew stimulus, Hardman said.  The pound “above $1.60 and sterling-yen above 130 look
like relatively attractive entry levels for short positions
against the pound,” he said.  U.K. 10-year bond yields fell three basis points to 2.11
percent. The 4 percent security due March 2022 rose 0.275, or
2.75 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 116.715 percent of
face value.  The Debt Management Office plans to auction as much as 3
billion pounds of bills tomorrow.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. That’s the
third worst performance among 26 sovereign markets tracked by
the indexes after Spain and  Greece .  To contact the reporter on this story:
