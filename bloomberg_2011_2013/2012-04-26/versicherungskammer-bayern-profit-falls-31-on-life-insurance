Versicherungskammer Bayern,
 Germany â€™s biggest public insurer, said profit fell 31 percent
last year as premium income from life insurance declined.  Net income fell to 91.4 million euros ($121 million) from
133.4 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based insurer
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Total gross premiums declined 7 percent to 6.6 billion
euros last year, with life-insurance premiums falling 20 percent
to 2.5 billion euros on reduced sales of single-premium
products, the insurer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
