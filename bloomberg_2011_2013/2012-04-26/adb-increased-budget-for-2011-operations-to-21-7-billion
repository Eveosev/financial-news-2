The  Asian Development Bank  raised
its budget for operations last year in an effort to accelerate
projects aimed at reducing poverty in the region.  The ADB approved a budget of $21.7 billion, 14.5 percent
higher from a year earlier, the Manila-based lender said in a
 statement  on its website accompanying its 2011 annual report.
Around $14 billion was financed by the ADB and special funds,
while $7.69 billion was funded by its partners, it said.  “Poverty reduction remains the greatest challenge for
developing Asia and the Pacific,” ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda
said in the report. “Although significant progress has been
made in reducing income poverty, large pockets of deprivation
remain, and disparities within and across countries continue to
grow.”  The ADB, formed in 1966 to improve the welfare of people in
 Asia  and the Pacific, has boosted spending on infrastructure and
poverty projects from  Laos  to Mongolia in the past decade as
rising food and commodity prices hurt the region’s poorest.  The bank is currently negotiating with donor countries to
fund at least $12 billion required for loans and grants to
projects in poor countries from 2013 to 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
