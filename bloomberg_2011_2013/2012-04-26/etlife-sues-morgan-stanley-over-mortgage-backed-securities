MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, sued Morgan Stanley in New York state court for fraud
over $757 million in residential mortgage-backed securities
purchased in 2006 and 2007.  MetLife accuses the New York-based  bank  of telling it that
the  mortgage loans  backing the securities were originated based
on “specific underwriting guidelines” and collateralized by
properties that had been “accurately appraised.”  “In truth, and as MetLife and the world would only later
discover, the originators whose loans collateralized the Morgan
Stanley RMBS at issue were among the worst of the worst culprits
in the subprime lending industry,” New York-based MetLife said
in a complaint filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan.  Mark Lake, a spokesman for  Morgan Stanley (MS) , declined to
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Morgan
Stanley, 651360/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
