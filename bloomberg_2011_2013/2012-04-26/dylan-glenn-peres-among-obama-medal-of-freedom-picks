Music icon  Bob Dylan , former
astronaut and Ohio Senator John Glenn and Israeli President
 Shimon Peres  are among 13 men and women President  Barack Obama 
has chosen to receive the Medal of Freedom.  The awards were announced today and will be presented in
the late spring, the White House said in a statement.  Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, author Toni Morrison and former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens also
are among those being honored for “especially meritorious
contributions to the security or national interests of the
United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other
significant public or private endeavors.”  Other recipients include John Doar, a lawyer who played key
roles in the civil rights era and Watergate investigation;
epidemiologist William Foege; farmworker organizer Dolores Huerta; and Pat Summitt, the former University of  Tennessee 
women’s basketball coach and Alzheimer’s patient advocate whose
award was announced earlier this month by the White House.  Posthumous honorees include Girl Scouts founder Juliette
Gordon Low; Jan Karski, who gave eyewitness accounts of the
Holocaust to government officials; and Gordon Hirabayashi, who
protested Japanese-American internment during World War II.  Obama, in a statement, said the honorees have “challenged
us, they’ve inspired us, and they’ve made the world a better
place.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
