Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  said it
will accept secondhand clothes at U.K. outlets to be resold,
recycled into other fabrics or reused overseas by the Oxfam
charity in a bid to cut waste.  Items will be accepted in all Marks & Spencer stores except
Simply Food, the London-based retailer said in a statement
today. Each store will have at least two cardboard donation
boxes. The retailer aims to recycle 350 million items a year in
the initiative it calls “shwopping.”  “We want to get back one garment for every one we sell,”
Chief Executive Officer  Marc Bolland  said in the statement. “It
is a big number, but with our customers’ help, we will do it.”  The items will be given to Oxfam, which will resell them in
its 700 stores, reuse them in international markets including
 Africa  and eastern Europe, or recycle the clothing into fabrics
or materials like building insulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
