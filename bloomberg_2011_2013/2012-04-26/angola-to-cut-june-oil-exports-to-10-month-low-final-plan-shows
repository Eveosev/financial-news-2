Angola ,  Africa â€™s second-largest oil
producer, will reduce daily crude exports for June to a 10-month
low, according to a final loading program obtained by Bloomberg.  The country will ship 51 cargoes, four fewer than next
month. Exports will total 48.92 million barrels, or 1.63 million
barrels a day, the least since August, compared with 1.7 million
barrels a day in May, the plan showed.  The schedule is unchanged from the preliminary program
released on April 16. Exports of Pazflor grade are still subject
to change, according to the plan.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of the program are as follows. Cargo sizes are
listed in multiples of 1,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
