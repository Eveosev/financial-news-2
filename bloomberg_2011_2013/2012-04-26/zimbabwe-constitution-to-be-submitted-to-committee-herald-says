A draft of  Zimbabwe ’s revised
constitution is ready to be submitted to the country’s
constitutional parliamentary committee, the state-controlled
 Herald  said, citing Paul Mangwana, the senior constitutional
negotiator in President Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front party.  Two disputed issues, the right to dual citizenship and
greater powers for provincial administrations, haven’t been
resolved, the Harare-based Herald newspaper said on its website.  Zimbabweans may vote in a referendum this year to accept or
reject the new constitution, which must be in place before
elections can be held. Under a 2008 agreement brokered by the
Southern African Development Community, Zanu-PF and the Movement
for Democratic Change, led by Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai ,
must share power until a vote takes place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
