The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the main U.S. derivatives regulator, is reviewing
the release of information about the first domestic case of mad
cow disease in six years.  Cattle futures slumped in advance of a U.S. Department of
Agriculture April 24 announcement that a case of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, had been confirmed in a dairy
cow in  California .  “CFTC reached out to USDA with questions on the BSE
announcement timeline for their routine market analysis,”
Courtney Rowe, USDA spokeswoman, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Steve Adamske , a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.  The USDA did not release information on the case until
after 2:15 p.m. on April 24 in Washington. Cattle futures on the
 Chicago  Mercantile Exchange were trading around $1.147 a pound
just before 11 a.m. in Chicago. In the next two hours, prices
plunged by the 3-cent exchange limit, dropping to $1.11575 a
pound, the lowest for a most-active contract since July 1.  Prices settled at that price. The day’s 2.6 percent decline
was the biggest since May 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
