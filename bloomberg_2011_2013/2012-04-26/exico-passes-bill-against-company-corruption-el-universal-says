Mexico â€™s Senate passed a bill that
would fine individuals or companies caught illegally obtaining
contracts from public companies and could imprison those
responsible,  El Universal  said.  The bill, which still needs to be signed into law by the
federal government, would levy fines against companies of as
much as 124 million pesos ($9.4 million) and would prohibit
firms involved in corruption from receiving government contracts
for as many as 10 years, the Mexico City-based newspaper said on
its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
