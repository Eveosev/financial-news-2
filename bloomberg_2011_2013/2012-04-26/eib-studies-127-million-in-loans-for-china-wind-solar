The  European Investment Bank  may
loan 96 million euros ($127 million) to wind farms and solar
power in China as it seeks to boost cooperation with the nation.  The European Union lending arm is studying a 70 million-
euro loan for two wind farms with 99 megawatts of capacity in
Chongqing province and a 26 million-euro loan for a 20-megawatt
solar plant in Shaanxi, according to a  website  statement.  Ninety percent of the EIB loan volumes go to EU countries
though it has mandates to lend elsewhere to  Asia , Latin America
and Africa. The bank agreed to a 500 million-euro program to
China, the  Climate Change Framework Loan II , for clean-energy
projects in 2010. The wind and solar loans detailed on the
website on April 24 are part of that program, designed to
strengthen the EU presence’s and cooperation in  China .  The loan must be approved by the EIB board and a finance
contract signed before the funds can be disbursed, according to
the bank’s website.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
