Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the world’s second-
largest truckmaker, reported first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as vehicle sales jumped in North America.  Net income fell 1.8 percent to 4.01 billion kronor ($597
million) from 4.09 billion kronor a year earlier, Gothenburg,
Sweden-based Volvo said today in a  statement . Profit exceeded
the 3.53 billion-krona average of 13 analyst  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 10 percent to 78.8 billion kronor.  Chief Executive Officer Olof Persson, who took his post in
September after running Volvo’s construction-equipment unit for
almost three years, is targeting operating margins at the top of
the heavy-equipment industry, shifting focus to profitability
from sales growth. Volvo raised its forecast for Europe’s truck
market by 4.5 percent and posted a 46 percent surge in
deliveries in  North America , where it makes Mack Trucks.  “The European market has stabilized a bit for Volvo and
with their exposure to North America, where they’re growing like
a rocket at the moment, they have a very nice geographical mix
that will help them in 2012,” Morten Imsgard, an analyst at
 Sydbank A/S (SYDB)  in Aabenraa,  Denmark , with an “overweight”
 recommendation  on Volvo’s stock, said by phone.  Volvo rose as much as 6 percent to 95 kronor, the biggest
intraday jump since Nov. 30, and was  trading  up 2.8 percent at
9:15 a.m. in Stockholm. The stock has gained 22 percent this
year, valuing the company at 196 billion kronor.  European Forecast  The manufacturer increased the forecast for European
industrywide sales this year to 230,000 trucks from a prediction
in February of 220,000 deliveries. That would amount to a 5.1
percent decline from 2011. Volvo, which is among truckmakers
predicting a contraction of  Europe ’s market because of the
sovereign-debt crisis, posted a 13 percent first-quarter drop in
deliveries in the region to 19,996 vehicles.  The company reiterated a forecast of a 250,000-truck market
in North America, a 16 percent gain from 2011. Volvo’s first-
quarter sales in the region rose to 12,848 vehicles.  First-quarter earnings before interest and taxes fell 4.3
percent to 6.24 billion kronor. Operating profit beat the 5.59
billion-kronor average of 14 estimates. The operating  margin 
narrowed to 7.9 percent of sales from 9.1 percent, a decline
that Volvo attributed to “a changed market mix.”  Scania AB (SCVB) , the Swedish competitor controlled by carmaker
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , reported first-quarter net income of 1.79 billion
kronor on April 24, beating analysts’ estimates after it
eliminated jobs to prepare for slowing demand and raised some
truck prices. Stuttgart, Germany-based  Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s
largest truckmaker, plans to publish figures tomorrow. Munich-
based  MAN SE (MAN)  is scheduled to report results on May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
