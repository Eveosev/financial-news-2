Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world’s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, gained the most in five
months after growth in its cable and satellite television units
helped first-quarter profit almost double.  Televisa rose 4.1 percent to 56.39 pesos at the close in
Mexico City, the biggest gain since Nov. 30. The shares have
gained 3 percent this year.  Televisa is luring customers of billionaire Carlos Slim’s
 America Movil (AMXL)  SAB with packages of cable TV, phone and  Internet
service . The three cable carriers controlled by Televisa added a
total of 35,000 video subscribers, 74,000  Internet users  and
34,000 phone customers in the quarter.  “Results beat our estimates across almost all business
lines,” said  David Joyce , an analyst at Miller Tabak & Co. in
 New York , today in a research note. “We would continue to be
buyers.”  Net income climbed to 1.5 billion pesos ($116 million) from
780.4 million pesos a year earlier, the Mexico City-based
company said yesterday. Sales increased 15 percent to 15.2
billion pesos, topping the 14.7 billion-peso average of three
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The satellite unit added 275,000 clients for a total of 4.3
million, compared with the 238,000 estimate of Vera Rossi, an
analyst at Barclays Plc in New York.  Sales in the content business, which includes broadcast
advertising, syndication and cable-TV networks, rose 14 percent
to 6.47 billion pesos. The growth came in part as the Mexican
government paid for more TV commercials before a ban on its
advertising during the presidential election cycle. Second-
quarter sales will be hurt by the ban, Executive Vice President
Alfonso de Angoitia said today on a conference call, without
providing an estimate.  Profit included a foreign-exchange gain of 342 million
pesos, up from a gain of 39.1 million pesos a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
