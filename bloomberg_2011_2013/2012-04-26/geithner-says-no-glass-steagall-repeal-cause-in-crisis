U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the repeal of Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era
law separating deposit-taking institutions from  investment
banking , didn’t play “a material role in the causes of our
financial crisis.”  “I know that view is not widely accepted in many places,”
Geithner said in response to a question after a speech in San
Francisco today. Geithner, 50, was president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of  New York  during the 2008 financial crisis and
became Treasury secretary the next year under President Barack Obama.  “A huge amount of risk built up outside our banking
system, outside the safeguards and protections we put in place
in the Great Depression,” Geithner said. “That risk and
leverage grew up, built up, very substantially, and when the
storm hit it put enormous pressure on a part of the system that
provided about half the credit to the American economy. Nothing
to do with Glass Steagall.”  Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
