Affinity Gaming LLC, a casino and
hotel operator, set the  interest rate  it will pay on a $200
million term loan B it’s seeking to refinance debt, according to
a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The debt will pay interest at 4.5 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private. Libor,
a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other,
will have a 1.25 percent floor.  Affinity Gaming is proposing to sell the loan at 99 cents
on the dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the
company and boosting the yield to investors.  Deutsche Bank AG is arranging the financing for the Las
Vegas-based company, the person said.  Proceeds from the new  term loan  along with $200 million in
senior secured notes due in 2020 will be used to repay the
company’s existing credit facility, the company said today in
statement distributed by  Business Wire .  The company’s existing term loan due in December 2015 was
quoted at 102.875 cents on the dollar today, down from 103 cents
yesterday, and pays interest at 7 percentage points more than
Libor with a 3 percent floor, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  William Schmitt, a spokesman for Affinity Gaming, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
