United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB) , a
Singapore-based lender, has committed funds to a HK$3 billion
($387 million) loan for Citic Pacific Ltd., according to two
people familiar with the matter.  Citic Pacific, a Hong Kong-based steelmaker with operations
in iron ore mining and property development in mainland China,
is arranging the facility by itself and is seeking commitments
of HK$500 million from banks, according to three other people
familiar with the matter.  The amount of the  loan  may be increased depending on how
much lenders commit, the three people said, declining to be
identified because the details are private. The loan pays an
all-in rate of 280 basis points more than the  Hong Kong 
interbank offered rate, a separate person familiar with the
matter said April 19.  Marjorie Law, a spokeswoman at Brunswick Group LLP, which
handles media relations for  Citic Pacific (267) , did not immediately
return two messages left at her Hong Kong office seeking comment
on the loan. United Overseas Bankâ€™s Singapore-based spokeswoman
Jean Khong declined to immediately comment when asked about the
commitment by phone today.  The loan will be used for investment in an iron ore project
in Australia, according to the three people who spoke today.
Citic Pacific arranged a visit for bankers to its sites in the
country earlier this month, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
