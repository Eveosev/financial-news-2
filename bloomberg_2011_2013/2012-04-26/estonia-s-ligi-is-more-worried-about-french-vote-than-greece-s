Estonian Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said he is more worried about promises by the leading
contender in the French presidential race to re-negotiate the
agreement to cut budget deficits in the euro area than the
Greek elections next month.  “A U-turn on the fiscal pact as promised by some hopefully
isn’t possible,” Ligi said in an interview with public
broadcaster  Eesti Rahvusringhaaling  today. “Election rhetoric
shouldn’t yet be considered as actual policies, but it is
worrying. The finance ministers are certainly following these
events with pain.”  Socialist Francois Hollande, the winner of the first round
of France’s presidential elections, said yesterday France won’t
ratify the European agreement pushed by  Germany  to tighten
budget rules if he’s elected. Hollande faces incumbent  Nicolas
Sarkozy  in a runoff on May 6, the same day as general elections
in  Greece .  Estonia will delay its goal to return to a surplus budget
by the year 2014 due to the European debt crisis, the country’s
government said earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
