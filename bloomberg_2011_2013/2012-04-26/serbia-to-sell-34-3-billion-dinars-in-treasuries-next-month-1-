The Serbian government will sell
34.3 billion dinars ($405.7 million) in Treasury bills and bonds
next month, the Belgrade-based  Debt Management Agency  said
today.  The government plans to raise 21.3 billion dinars through
53-week and 24-month debt issues, on May 7, 15 and 22
respectively, five billion dinars each in six-month and 18-month
bills on May 3 and 9 and will try to borrow another 3 billion
dinars in 5-year bonds on May 29.  The total borrowing planned for May is 35 percent less than
the amount the government wanted to raise in April, the month
before general elections, when weaker demand for longer-dated
debt led to faltering debt auctions.  Serbia is heavily reliant on domestic market borrowing to
ensure budget liquidity and finance this year’s deficit, seen by
the  International Monetary Fund  at 5.25 percent of gross
domestic product, excluding new debt issuance and sovereign
guarantees.  The Washington-based lender froze its $1.3 billion
precautionary loan program for Serbia in January, after it
turned out that the 2012 deficit will exceed the agreed limit of
4.25 percent of GDP.  The new government, which will be formed after the May 6
ballot will need to quickly revise the 2012 budget, cut the gap
and limit the new state borrowing to preserve investors’
confidence, the IMF resident representative Bogdan Lissovolik
said in a March 30 interview.  The nation is struggling to maintain capital inflows after
its January-February current account deficit expanded 47 percent
on year, as both portfolio and foreign direct investment
declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
