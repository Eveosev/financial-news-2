Syria ’s main opposition group
called on Arab foreign ministers meeting today to press for the
speedy deployment of United Nations observers to the country.  Syrian National Council spokeswoman Basma Kidmani was
quoted by the state-run Middle East News Agency as saying
officials needed to issue a strong call to ensure the deployment
of 300 unarmed UN observers charged with monitoring a cease-fire
designed to end fighting between Syrian government forces and
rebels.  Kidmani said a meeting of various Syrian opposition groups
could be held under the auspices of the  Arab League  on May 16-17
to agree a united front for the groups.  The cease-fire has been crumbling, according to UN envoy
 Kofi Annan , and the opposition has been pushing for tougher
measures against President Bashar al-Assad’s government.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
