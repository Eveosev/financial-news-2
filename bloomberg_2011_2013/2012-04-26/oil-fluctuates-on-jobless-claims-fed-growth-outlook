Oil rose to a three-week high after
pending U.S. home sales gained more than forecast in March and
the dollar decreased against most major currencies, bolstering
the appeal of commodities to investors.  Futures climbed 0.4 percent after the index of  pending home
purchases  rose 4.1 percent to 101.4, the highest level since
April 2010, according to the National Association of Realtors.
The median forecast of 43 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
was a 1 percent rise. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  fell, extending the five-
day loss to 0.8 percent.  There were “some pretty darn good pending home sales data
today,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst at futures brokerage
PFGBest in  Chicago . “The dollar is down, which is helping most
of the commodities. There seems to be a small return of the risk
play to the market.”  Crude oil for June delivery rose 43 cents to $104.55 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since April 2. Prices are up 5.8 percent this year.  Brent oil for June settlement increased 80 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $119.92 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract’s  premium  to
West Texas Intermediate crude traded in  New York  was $15.37, up
from $15 yesterday.  Equities Gain  Commodities and equities climbed after the release of the
home-purchase data. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities and the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.7 percent.  The dollar declined as much as 0.3 percent versus the euro.
The Dollar Index dropped 0.1 percent to 78.928, down 3.5 percent
from the 52-week high set in January.  Oil fell as much as 0.3 percent in early trading as the
Labor Department reported that more Americans than forecast
filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last week. Jobless
 claims  fell by 1,000 to 388,000. The median forecast of 48
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 375,000.  “The move higher is perplexing because the economic data
cancel each other out,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of IAF
Advisors, a Houston-based consulting firm. “The housing numbers
were better than expected, but the jobless numbers were worse.”  A Commerce Department report tomorrow may show that U.S.
growth slowed in the first quarter, increasing speculation that
the  Federal Reserve  will consider more stimulus, aiding
commodity prices. U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.5
percent annual rate in the quarter after advancing 3 percent in
the last quarter of 2011, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Wien’s Prediction  Oil in New York reached $110.55 on March 1, the highest
intraday level since May 4, amid speculation that Western
sanctions aimed at halting  Iran’s nuclear program  would disrupt
Middle East shipments. Prices have fallen 5.4 percent from that
peak since tension has eased.  The price of oil “is going to go down,”  Byron Wien , vice
chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners LP, said in an
interview with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance Midday.” More oil will be produced and “the
Iran premium is going to come out of the price,” he said.  Iranian and Israeli officials offered what may be
conciliatory signs this week, easing concern that the flow of
oil would be disrupted by a military strike.  Mahmoud-Reza Sajjadi, Iran’s envoy to Moscow, yesterday
said officials are considering a Russian proposal to avert
additional sanctions. In an interview with the Haaretz
newspaper, Israel’s Army Chief of General Staff Benny Gantz said
 Iran ’s leadership is “rational” and won’t seek to build a
bomb.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 357,897
contracts as of 4:41 p.m. Volume totaled 538,191 contracts
yesterday, the fifth straight day under 600,000 and 14 percent
below the three-month average. Open interest was 1.56 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
