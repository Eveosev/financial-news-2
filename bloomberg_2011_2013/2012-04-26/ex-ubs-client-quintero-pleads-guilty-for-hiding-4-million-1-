Luis Quintero, a former  UBS AG (UBSN) 
client from  Miami Beach , Florida, was sentenced to four months
in federal prison for failing to disclose $4 million in Swiss
bank accounts, the  Miami U.S. Attorney ’s Office said.  Quintero, a 64-year-old wholesale perfume importer, pleaded
guilty in April and agreed to pay a $2 million fine for failing
to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts for the
calendar year 2006, according to court records.  Born in Cuba, Quintero immigrated to the U.S. when he was
10 years old. He owned Genesis International Marketing Corp.,
which sold designer perfumes and cosmetics, primarily in airport
and duty free shops in the Caribbean and  Latin America ,
according to court records. He was sentenced yesterday in Miami
federal court, according to an e-mailed statement.  U.S. prosecutors have charged about 50 Americans with tax
crimes since 2009, when UBS avoided prosecution by paying $780
million, admitting it helped thousands of U.S. citizens evade
taxes and turning over the names of 250 clients to U.S.
authorities. Zurich-based UBS later revealed another 4,450
accounts.  Quintero’s attorney, Ian Comisky, declined to immediately
comment.  The case is U.S. v. Luis A. Quintero, 12-cr-20192, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  Florida  (Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
