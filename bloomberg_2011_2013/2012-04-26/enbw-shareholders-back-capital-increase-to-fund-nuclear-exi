EnBW Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) ,
Germany’s third-biggest utility, got approval from its
shareholders to seek fresh money to pay for the switch from
nuclear generation to renewable energy.  Shareholders backed the plan for a capital increase of
about 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) by setting an authorized
capital of as much as 100 million euros at the annual general
meeting in Karlsruhe today, EnBW said in an e-mailed statement.  The money has been pledged from the state of Baden-
Wuerttemberg and the OEW association of municipalities, which
each hold a 46.55 percent stake in the company. Shareholders
also approved a dividend of 0.85 euros a share, EnBW said.  EnBW needs fresh cash to help fund the utility’s transition
to renewables. Two of the company’s four reactors were closed
last year after the nuclear meltdown in  Japan  prompted
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to announce plans to phase out atomic
power by 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
