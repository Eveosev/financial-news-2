Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)  rose the most
in more than four months after a report that Japan’s  Nexon Co. (3659) 
may acquire the second-largest U.S. video-game publisher.  Electronic Arts  gained  6.1 percent to $15.93 at the close
in New York, the biggest jump since Nov. 30. The Redwood City,
California-based company has tumbled 23 percent this year.  Nexon, the Tokyo-based video-game maker, has contacted
Electronic Arts, Maeil Business said, citing unidentified
industry officials.  Nexon is in talks to buy smartphone and mobile-game
developers, Chief Financial Officer Owen Mahoney said in an
interview this month. Nexon announced two investments in game
companies in the past two months.  “Nexon has a policy of never commenting on rumors,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  Jeff Brown , an Electronic
Arts spokesman, said in an e-mail that the company doesn’t
comment on rumors or speculation.  Nexon’s shares fell 2.3 percent to 1,524 yen at the close
of Tokyo trading yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
