Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. plans to
complete a $3 billion loan this month and probably won’t market
the deal more widely in general syndication, said three people
familiar with the matter.  The loan is being marketed to banks in senior syndication
and Alibaba expects to complete the facility at this stage, with
enough commitments from banks to avoid further syndication.
Alibaba may raise about $2 billion in senior syndication, the
people said yesterday, declining to be identified because the
details are private.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Credit Suisse
Group AG, DBS Bank Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc,
and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. have already signed and
underwritten the facility, the people said.  Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank Co. committed $130 million to
the loan this week, while Barclays Plc and Morgan Stanley
committed $300 million each to the facility earlier this month,
the people said.  Bank of East Asia Ltd. (23) , Natixis and Taishin
International Bank also joined the loan earlier this month, the
people said.  The deadline for banks to respond with commitments is April
30, the people said. John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman
for Alibaba, declined to comment on the financing when contacted
on his mobile telephone.  Alibaba Group, run by billionaire Jack Ma, offered HK$13.50
($1.74) a share for the 27 percent it doesn’t already own in
 Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688) , according to a Feb. 21 regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
