Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP)  issued
$1.9 billion of bonds in a three-part sale to help pay for its
intended acquisition of StarBev LP of Prague.  Molson Coors sold $300 million of five-year, 2 percent
notes that yield 125 basis points more than Treasuries, $500
million of 10-year, 3.5 percent securities at a 160-basis point
spread and $1.1 billion of 5 percent, 30-year notes at a 190-
basis point premium, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Standard & Poorâ€™s  rated the debt BBB-, one level above junk.  The beer producer is turning to the dollar-denominated  bond
market  for the first time since 2007 to help fund the $3.5
billion StarBev purchase, Bloomberg data show. Montreal- and
Denver-based  Molson Coors  may lose its investment-grade ratings
unless it improves its financial profile after the deal, S&P
said in a note on April 3.  The acquisition will help Molson Coors expand outside its
main regions of North America and the U.K., where high
unemployment and aggressive competition are weighing on growth.
StarBev operates nine breweries in Central and Eastern European
countries including the  Czech Republic , Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria.  Credit-default swaps tied to Molson Coors have risen to 109
basis points today from 79 basis points on April 2, the day
before it agreed to buy the maker of Staropramen, Bloomberg data
show. Buying StarBev may boost its debt to about 3.5 times its
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
according to an April 3 note from  Fitch Ratings .  Molson Coors last issued U.S. dollar debt five years ago,
when it sold convertible notes, Bloomberg data show. It sold
bonds denominated in Canadian dollars in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
