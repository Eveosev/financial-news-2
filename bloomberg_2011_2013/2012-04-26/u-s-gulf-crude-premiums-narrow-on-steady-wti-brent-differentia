Most U.S. Gulf Coast crudes’
premiums narrowed as the gap between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent held near $15 a barrel.  Brent crude’s premium over WTI, based on June futures
prices, has ranged from $14.14 to $15.60 for nine days. When
Brent rises versus WTI, it typically strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI lost $1.15 to $16.60
a barrel at 4:49 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 10 cents
to a premium of $16.65.  Mars Blend’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $10.75.
Poseidon’s premium widened 40 cents to $10.25, while Southern
Green Canyon’s widened 25 cents to $9.75. The three grades are
used in the Argus Sour Crude Index.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude
with lower sulfur content than the other three grades, fell 65
cents against WTI to a premium of $14.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed 25 cents
to $16 a barrel. Syncrude’s discount strengthened 50 cents to
$1.50 and Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $6.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
