Howard Stern ’s production company
and agent appealed a  New York  state judge’s dismissal of a
lawsuit against Sirius XM Radio Inc. over unpaid stock awards.  One Twelve Inc. and the agent, Don Buchwald, sued Sirius XM
Radio last year, claiming the company refused to pay $300
million in stock awards owed under an agreement that brought the
radio personality to Sirius.  Justice Barbara Kapnick of state  Supreme Court  dismissed
the suit April 16, rejecting arguments that subscribers to XM
Satellite Radio, which merged with Sirius in 2008, should be
counted when calculating compensation.  The court “misinterpreted the parties’ contract and
granted summary judgment before there was any discovery taken in
the action,” lawyers for One Twelve and Buchwald said in court
documents filed yesterday. “Reversal is warranted because,
among other things, the parties’ contract is clear on its face
that plaintiffs are entitled to the relief they seek or is, at a
minimum, ambiguous.”  The case is One Twelve Inc. v.  Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI) ,
650762-2011, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
