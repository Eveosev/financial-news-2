Air China Ltd. (601111) , the world’s largest
carrier by market value, and  China  Southern Airlines Co. both
said first-quarter profit plunged because of smaller foreign-
exchange gains, higher fuel prices and slower economic growth.  Air China’s net income tumbled 86 percent to 239 million
yuan ($38 million), and China Southern reported a 74 percent
drop to 319 million yuan. The carriers released earnings
statements to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday.  The airlines both filled a smaller percentage of seats in
the period than a year earlier as fleet expansion outpaced
cooling travel demand. They also booked smaller currency gains
after the yuan halted advances against the dollar that had pared
the value of debts from buying planes.  Air China’s currency gains were 586 million yuan less than
a year earlier, it said. The Beijing-based airline’s sales rose
7.7 percent to 22.9 billion yuan.  The yuan posted its first quarterly decline since 2009 in
the three months ended March as  China’s economy  expanded at the
slowest pace in almost three years. Airlines also had to contend
with fuel prices that averaged 9.1 percent higher than a year
earlier in Singapore trading.  China Southern, the nation’s biggest carrier by passenger
numbers, has dropped 12 percent this year in Hong Kong trading.
Air China, part-owned by  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , has
slipped 11 percent.  Air China will sell 188.6 million shares to its parent at
5.57 yuan each, raising 1.05 billion, according to a Shanghai
Stock Exchange filing. The stock will resume trading in Shanghai
today. Its last trading day was April 19.  China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670) , the nation’s second-biggest
carrier, has said that its profit probably fell more than 50
percent in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
