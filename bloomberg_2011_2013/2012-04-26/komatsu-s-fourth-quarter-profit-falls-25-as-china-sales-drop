Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-
largest maker of excavators, posted a 25 percent decline in
fourth-quarter profit after Chinese sales declined.  Net income  fell to 37.7 billion yen ($464 million) for the
three months ended March 31 from 50.1 billion yen a year
earlier, according to calculations based on full-year results
reported by the Tokyo-based company today.  Industry  sales  for excavators built by foreign makers in
 China  in the last financial year dropped a more-than-expected 37
percent to 70,000 units, according to  Hitachi Construction
Machinery Co. (6305) , Komatsu’s closest domestic rival. Construction
machinery makers are relying on resource projects in  Indonesia 
and the U.S. and  Japan ’s efforts to rebuild areas hit by last
year’s earthquake to make up for falling Chinese sales.  Komatsu today forecast net income will rise 14 percent to
190 billion yen in the year to March 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
