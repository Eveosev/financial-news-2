Cielo SA (CIEL3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest card-
payment processor by market value, reported first-quarter
earnings that beat estimates as revenue increased more than
costs.  Net income  rose 33 percent to 566.6 million reais ($301.4
million) from 424.7 million reais a year earlier, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday. The Barueri, Brazil-based company’s
result beat the  mean estimate  of 511.4 million reais for
adjusted net income in a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts.  Chief Executive Officer Romulo de Mello Dias increased the
company’s adjusted operating net revenue to 1.4 billion reais in
the first quarter, up 29 percent from 1.08 billion reais a year
earlier. The cost per transaction rose 6.9 percent to 31
centavos.  Cielo gained market share without deterioration in its
merchant discount rate or point-of-sale rental-equipment fees,
Francisco Kops and Rafael Ferraz, analysts at Banco J.Safra in
 Sao Paulo , wrote in a note to clients on April 17.  The combined value of credit-and debit-card transactions
grew 26 percent to 88.1 billion reais.  Redecard SA (RDCD3) , Cielo’s biggest rival, may be delisted from
the Sao Paulo stock exchange as its controlling shareholder,
Itau Unibanco Holding SA, is seeking to buy out the company. The
Sao Paulo-based bank offered to pay 35 reais a share, or 11.8
billion reais, to acquire the part of the company is doesn’t
own.  Cielo rose 29 percent to 51.95 reais in Sao Paulo trading
this year, compared with a 10 percent gain for Redecard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
