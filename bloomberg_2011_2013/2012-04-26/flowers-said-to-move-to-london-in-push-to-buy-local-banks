J.  Christopher Flowers , founder of
private-equity firm JC Flowers & Co., has moved to  London  from
the U.S. to take advantage of what he sees as more investment
opportunities in Europe, according to a company official.  While Flowers still has a residence in the U.S., he will
mainly live in Europe for the time being, said the official for
the New York-based company, asking not to be named.  JC Flowers & Co. makes private-equity investments in
financial companies. It is seeking to buy financial-services
companies including banks and insurers in the U.K., Ireland,
Spain, Italy, France, Poland and Germany, Flowers said during an
interview at the SuperReturn International conference in Berlin
in March.  “There will be significant consolidation in the banking
industry in Europe and the process is being considerably
accelerated by the crisis,” he said at the time.  Flowers’s move to London was reported earlier by the
Financial Times.  The firm is investing out of its third fund, which closed
at $2.3 billion in 2009. In October, JC Flowers agreed to buy
insurance broker Fidea NV from  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , the recipient of 7
billion euros ($9.3 billion) in Belgian rescue funds, for 243.6
million euros. The firm also invested in the U.K.’s  Kent
Reliance Building Society .  To contact the reporter on this story:
