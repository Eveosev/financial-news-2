The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2 basis points to 161.5 basis
points as of 8:31 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The gauge is on course for its lowest close since April 5,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 3 basis points to
177 as of 9:29 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is set for its first daily drop since April 19,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index decreased 3 basis points
to 155 as of 10:31 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show.
The measure is poised to fall for three consecutive days,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
