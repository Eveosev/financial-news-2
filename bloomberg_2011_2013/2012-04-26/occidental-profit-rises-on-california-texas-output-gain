Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , the
largest onshore crude producer in the continental U.S., said
first-quarter profit increased on new output from  California  and
 Texas .  Net income climbed to $1.56 billion, or $1.92 a share, from
$1.55 billion, or $1.90, a year earlier, Los Angeles-based
Occidental said in a statement today. Per-share profit met the
average of 20  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Production during the quarter rose to the equivalent of 755,000
barrels a day from 730,000 a year earlier, a company record.  Chief Executive Officer Stephen I. Chazen, who took over in
May, has said he plans to spend about $4.57 billion in 2012
developing U.S. oil and natural-gas prospects. Texas and
California has become more attractive as costs to drill in  North
Dakota ’s Bakken formation rise, Chazen told investors on a
conference call today.  Oil production in Texas’ Permian region, which has exceeded
company expectations in the past 10 years, is poised to “grow
sharply” if prices remain at current levels, he said. “The
Permian has really gone through a significant rejuvenation, and
so we’re well positioned to reap that.”  Occidental is seeking to boost domestic crude production in
2012 by as much as 32,000 barrels a day, with much of the
increase coming in California and Texas. The Permian is
Occidental’s biggest U.S. oil production area, accounting for 57
percent of the company’s output in the first quarter.  ‘Positive on California’  In California, the company owns about 870,000 acres of land
in the Monterey Shale, which holds more than 15 billion barrels
of oil, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration
estimate.  “Steve Chazen was as positive on California as he’s been
since he became CEO,” Tim Rezvan, an analyst with Sterne Agee &
Leach Inc. in  New York , said in a telephone interview. “You
could see them accelerating activity there significantly.”  Sales rose 9.5 percent to $6.27 billion. Domestic oil and
gas production rose 13 percent to the equivalent of 455,000
barrels a day, an all-time high, including 86,000 barrels of
crude a day in California and 139,000 barrels in Texas,
according to the statement.  The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S.
benchmark, surged 8.9 percent to average $103.03 a barrel during
the first three months of 2012, from $94.60 a year earlier.
Occidental sold crude for an average of $107.98 a barrel in the
quarter, a 17 percent increase from the same period last year.
Domestic gas prices dropped 33 percent.  The company has pared back drilling of gas wells after
prices in New York reached a 10-year low. It may cut back
production of natural gas liquids if prices continue to fall,
Chazen said on the call.  Occidental  rose  2 percent to $91.90 at the close in New
York. The shares, which have 17 buy and five hold ratings from
analysts, have dropped 1.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
