India ’s cabinet approved a proposal
to raise the cap on  voting rights  for shareholders in private
banks to 26 percent from 10 percent, Information and
Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni said in New Delhi today.  The plan is part of the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill that
was first introduced in 2005 in parliament for approval and has
been languishing since. A panel of lawmakers on Dec. 13 had
recommended raising the limit on voting rights to 26 percent.
The move may help enhance the central bank’s regulatory powers.  The proposed bill will become law after India’s parliament
passes it following cabinet consent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
