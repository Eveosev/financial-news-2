JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  hedged about
26 percent of its jet-fuel needs for the second quarter.  The carrier expects fuel needs, including the impact of
hedges and taxes, to average about $3.33 a gallon in the second
quarter, New York-based JetBlue said in a statement today. For
the full year, the company has hedged 21 percent of its fuel
needs and expects 2012 costs to average $3.30.  JetBlue said that it used crude call options, jet fuel
swaps and collars, a protective options strategy to help prevent
massive losses, to lock in its fuel requirements.  -Editors: Dan Stets, Charlotte Porter  To contact the reporter on this story:
