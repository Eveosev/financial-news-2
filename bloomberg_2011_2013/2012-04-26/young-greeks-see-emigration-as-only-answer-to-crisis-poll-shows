Most young Greeks are considering
abandoning the country, as  Greece  is in its fifth year of
recession with unemployment nearing a record 22 percent, an
opinion poll showed.  Fifty-three percent of 444 men and women aged between 18
and 24 said they might emigrate, while 17 percent are ready to
leave the country, according to a survey by  Focus Bari  for
 Panteion University  in Athens. No margin of error was given.  Seventy-six percent said emigration is the best way to cope
with the country’s financial crisis while almost seven out of 10
of those polled said they have been significantly affected by
the crisis.  The Greek government pushed through a new round of
austerity measures earlier this year, in order to secure a 130
billion-euro ($172 billion) second rescue package from its
European partners. Unemployment among Greeks between 15 and 24
years old reached 50.8 percent in January, according to data
released by the Hellenic Statistical Authority on April 12.  Only 14 percent of those surveyed said they stay in Greece
because they take the view that they can help improve the
situation. The survey was conducted between Jan. 10 and Jan. 17
and posted today on the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
