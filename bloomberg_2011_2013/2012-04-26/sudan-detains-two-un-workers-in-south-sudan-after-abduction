Two members of the United Nations
peacekeeping operation in  South Sudan  are being held in
neighboring  Sudan  after they were abducted two months ago, said
Josephine Guerreo, a UN spokeswoman.  The UN workers were abducted on Feb. 24 while posted to a
base in Gok Machar in South Sudan’s Northern Bahr Al Ghazel
state, which borders Sudan’s South Darfur state, Guerrero said
late yesterday in an e-mailed response to questions from Juba,
South Sudan’s capital. The  mission  is only allowed to operate in
South Sudan.  “Efforts are being made to secure their release, and we
have been able to contact them,” Guerrero said. She said she
couldn’t provide further details about who abducted the
peacekeepers, how they ended up in custody in Sudan or why they
have not been released.  The head of Darfur’s transitional regional authority, al-
Tijani al-Sissi, and Sudanese police spokesman al-Ser Ahmed Omar
didn’t answer calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
