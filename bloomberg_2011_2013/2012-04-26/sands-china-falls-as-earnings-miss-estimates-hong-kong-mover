Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Asian unit of
billionaire Sheldon Adelson’s  Las Vegas  company, fell the most
in more than two weeks in Hong Kong trading after first-quarter
earnings missed market expectations.  The stock dropped 2.4 percent to HK$31.05 at the close of
Hong Kong trading, the most since April 10, after the company
reported a 21 percent increase in earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, to $450.6
million that Deutsche Bank said was below market expectations
due to lower retail revenue and narrower margins at Sands’ Four
Seasons Plaza property. Net income climbed 5.8 percent to $277.4
million.  Sands’ business has benefited from a rise in Chinese
 tourists  visiting the world’s largest gambling hub of Macau.
Competition has also heated up in the former Portuguese colony
as Sands and rivals including  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) 
build more resorts to draw gamblers from  China ’s mainland.  Sands China’s first-quarter net revenue gained 25 percent
to $1.45 billion, according to a statement prepared in U.S. GAAP
standards from parent company Las Vegas Sands Corp.  Earlier this month, Sands China opened the first phase of
Sands Cotai Central, the company’s latest resort on the
increasingly popular Cotai Strip. It will have about 5,800 hotel
rooms when completed in 2013 under the brands Conrad, Sheraton
and  Holiday Inn . It now offers 1,800 rooms.  The Hong Kong unit of Las Vegas Sands already operates the
territory’s largest resort, the Venetian Macau that boasts
singing gondoliers, a grand canal and an artificial blue sky.  Singapore Profit Surge  The Macau casino operator’s parent  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) 
reported a 72 percent gain in first-quarter net income to $498.9
million, beating analysts’ projections, aided by its  U.S. and
Singapore businesses. Casino revenue in Singapore surged 51
percent to $701.3 million in the quarter. The Marina Bay Sands
there averaged 98 percent occupancy at $341 a night, the company
said. In Las Vegas, casino revenue jumped 91 percent to $158.7
million.  The number of  tourists  to Macau increased 8 percent to 7
million in the first three months from a year earlier.  Casino
revenue  in the former Portuguese colony also climbed 27 percent
to 74.3 billion patacas in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
