Gold traders are more bullish after
central banks expanded their bullion reserves and  hedge funds 
increased bets on a rally for the first time in three weeks.  Fourteen of 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices
to gain next week and nine were neutral, the highest proportion
in two weeks.  Mexico , Russia and Turkey added about 44.8 metric
tons valued at $2.4 billion to reserves in March, International
Monetary Fund data show. Fund managers raised their so-called
net-long positions by 2.5 percent in the week ended April 17,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said April 25 that
he’s prepared to “do more” if needed to spur the economy, and
the  Bank of Japan (8301)  today expanded its bond-purchase plan by 10
trillion yen ($124 billion). Gold rose about 70 percent as the
Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of quantitative
easing ending in June 2011. The U.K. fell into its first double-
dip recession since the 1970s, data showed April 25, while the
IMF predicts the 17-nation euro region will contract.  “Ultra-loose monetary policies of recent years don’t look
like they’re going to end any time soon,” said Mark O’Byrne,
the executive director of Dublin-based GoldCore Ltd., a
brokerage that sells and stores everything from quarter-ounce
British Sovereigns to 400-ounce bars. “The problems in the  euro
zone  don’t look like they’re going to end any time soon. We’ve
had a dip, and our advice to clients is always to buy the dip.”  Gold Gains  Gold rose 6.2 percent to $1,664.40 an ounce this year on
the Comex in New York, and is now 7.2 percent below this year’s
peak. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials
climbed 5.8 percent as the MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWD)  of
equities added 9.9 percent. Treasuries gained less than 0.1
percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Options traders are also bullish, with the most widely held
contract on futures traded on the Comex conferring the right to
buy at $2,200 by July, 32 percent above prices now. The seven
most popular options give owners the right to buy at prices
ranging from $1,800 to $2,300, bourse data show.  Central banks are joining investors in buying gold, adding
439.7 tons in 2011, the most in almost five decades, the London-
based World Gold Council estimates. They may buy a similar
amount this year, it predicts. Mexico bought 16.8 tons last
month as Russia added 16.5 tons and  Turkey ’s holdings expanded
by 11.5 tons. Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Tajikistan and Belarus also
raised reserves, according to the IMF.  Hedge Funds  Speculators increased  wagers  on price gains to 112,275
futures and options, from a three-year low the previous week,
CFTC data show. The net-long position is still 56 percent below
the peak reached in August. That provides “ample room” for new
long positions,  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG in London,
wrote yesterday in a report.  Investors own 2,389.6 tons in bullion-backed  exchange-
traded products , within 0.9 percent of the record reached on
March 13, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Demand for bullion
coins is weakening, with the  U.S. Mint  selling 17,000 ounces so
far this month, compared with an average 75,917 ounces in the
previous 12 months, data on its website show.  The Fed said two days ago that growth will “pick up
gradually” as the labor and housing markets show signs of
improvement. About $4.99 trillion was added to the value of
global equities this year on optimism the world will skirt
another recession. The IMF raised its global growth outlook to
3.5 percent from 3.3 percent on April 17, while forecasting a
0.3 percent contraction in the euro area.  U.S. Recovery  “If people really believe that the U.S. recovery is coming
through, I think they will buy equities,” said Carole Ferguson,
an analyst at Fairfax IS in  London . “Gold is more likely to go
sideways.”  Other investors may also be shunning gold. Open interest,
or contracts outstanding, in U.S. futures declined to 395,389 on
April 24, the lowest level since September 2009, bourse data
show. That contrasts with combined open interest across the 24
commodities in the S&P GSCI, which rose 18 percent this year.  Bullion slid from a record $1,923.70 in September, taking
it below the 200-day moving average, a sign of more declines to
some investors. That may present a “buying opportunity,”
GoldCore’s O’Byrne said. Prices held above the measure from the
beginning of 2009 through the end of last year.  The metal will trade at $1,940 in 12 months, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said in an April 24 report. The bank maintained a
neutral outlook on raw materials in the near term, partly
because of European debt concerns.  Benchmark Contract  In other commodities, 12 of 28 traders and analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expect copper to climb next week and eight
were neutral. The metal for delivery in three months, the London
Metal Exchange’s benchmark contract, rose 11 percent to
$8,400.50 a ton this year.  Six of 13 people surveyed said raw sugar will decline next
week and three were neutral. The commodity dropped 10 percent
this year to 20.94 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Eighteen of 29 people surveyed anticipate higher corn
prices next week, while 16 of 30 said soybeans will advance.
Corn slipped 2.9 percent to $6.28 a bushel this year as soybeans
climbed 24 percent to $14.9525 a bushel.  “It should be the macro factors and political
uncertainties that influence the markets most, and less the
fundamental factors,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “The sovereign debt crisis should
stay in focus. I think it’s premature to say that we have seen
the worst.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
