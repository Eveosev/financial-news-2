Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s Altimo may use dividends from OAO Megafon to increase
its stake in another cell-phone operator,  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) ,
 Vedomosti  said, citing an unidentified company official.  Altimo, a telecommunication division of Fridman’s Alfa
Group, will receive about $1.5 billion in dividends from Megafon
and plans to use the cash to buy 6 percent stake in VimpelCom
from Ukraine’s billionaire Victor Pinchuk, the Moscow-based
newspaper said.  The planned transaction may increase Altimo’s stake in
VimpelCom to 31 percent, Vedomosti said. Altimo is competing for
the influence over the company with  Norway ’s  Telenor ASA (TEL) , which
owns more than 39 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
