China, the world’s second-biggest
rapeseed grower, plans to increase the amount the government
pays farmers for the oilseed by more than 8 percent, according
to three people with knowledge of the matter.  The plan was submitted to  Finance Ministry  and National
Development and Reform Commission officials in Beijing
yesterday, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the information hasn’t been made public. Farmers may get
5,000 yuan ($793) a metric ton, from 4,600 yuan last year, for
rapeseed sold into state inventories, they said.  China has been stockpiling rapeseed to boost prices and
encourage more production as farmers switch to more profitable
crops such as wheat or move to cities to work. The proposed
increase in the amount paid to farmers still need the approval
of the State Council, the people said. Officials at the ministry
and commission, the nation’s top economic planning agency,
declined to comment when contacted by phone and fax today.  The country may import 2 million tons of rapeseed this
year, 59 percent more than in 2011, Grain.gov.cn, a unit of the
state-controlled  China  National Grain & Oils Information Center,
said in a report April 24. First-quarter imports rose fourfold
from a year earlier, customs data show. Canada is the world’s
biggest supplier of the oilseed.  Crude rapeseed oil for September delivery rose as much as
1.1 percent to 10,732 yuan a ton on the Zhengzhou Commodity
Exchange today, and closed at 10,692 yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
