European stocks  were little changed
after a rally in automakers helped offset a drop in euro-area
confidence and a report that showed more Americans than forecast
filed for jobless benefits last week.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  rallied 8.7 percent after reporting a jump in
operating profit. Porsche SE climbed 7.4 percent.  Rhoen Klinikum
AG (RHK)  surged 44 percent after receiving a 3.1 billion euros ($4.1
billion) takeover offer.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
paced financial shares lower.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.1 percent to 257.2 at
the close in  London , after swinging between gains and losses
today. The gauge has advanced 5.2 percent this year as the
 European Central Bank  disbursed more than 1 trillion euros to
the region’s lenders to spur credit and boost the economy.  “After the euphoria of the ECB capital injection, we’ve
come back to reality,” said Matthieu Giuliani, who helps manage
$4 billion at Paris-based Banque Palatine SA. “Economic
statistics will continue to be difficult considering countries’
deficits and the fact that they aren’t attacking the problem.
Growth in the macroeconomy won’t be found soon.”  National benchmark indexes declined in 12 of the 18 western
European markets. France’s CAC 40 Index fell 0.1 percent while
the U.K.’s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  and Germany’s DAX both climbed 0.5 percent.
The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies was
1.5 percent higher today than the average of the last 30 days,
according to Bloomberg data.  Euro Confidence  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area fell to 92.8 this month from a revised 94.5 in
March, the European Commission said today. Economists had
forecast a drop to 94.2 from a previously reported 94.4,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  More Americans than forecast filed applications for
 unemployment benefits  last week, a sign that the labor market is
taking time to improve.  Jobless claims fell by 1,000 to 388,000 in the week ended
April 21 from a revised 389,000 the prior period that was the
highest since early January, Labor Department figures showed
today in Washington. The median forecast of 48 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a drop to 375,000.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled that further Fed
stimulus is unlikely unless the economy unexpectedly
deteriorates. With inflation close to the Fed’s goal of 2
percent, it would be “reckless” to pursue policies that would
drive up prices faster while offering “perhaps doubtful gains”
to the economy, Bernanke said. Still, central bankers “remain
prepared to do more” if conditions worsen, he said.  Signs of Improvement  The U.S. labor and housing markets have shown signs of
improvement, and growth will “pick up gradually” after
remaining “moderate,” the  Federal Open Market Committee  said
yesterday in Washington, repeating a plan to keep borrowing
costs low until at least late 2014. Fed officials also upgraded
their projections for economic growth, inflation and the
 unemployment rate  for this year.  Volkswagen preferred shares jumped 8.7 percent to 137.2
euros after the world’s second-largest carmaker reported a 10
percent jump in first-quarter operating profit to 3.21 billion
euros, on higher earnings at the Audi luxury brand. That
surpassed the 2.66 billion-euro average analyst estimate in
Bloomberg survey.  Porsche increased 7.4 percent to 44.68 euros, while Daimler
AG increased 3.2 percent to 42.66 euros.  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  also advanced
2.6 percent to 92 kronor after the world’s second-largest
truckmaker reported first-quarter profit that beat analyst
estimates.  Automobile shares climbed 2.7 percent for the biggest
increase among the Stoxx 600 industry groups.  Rhoen Klinikum soared 44 percent to 21.25 euros as
Fresenius SE offered to buy the German hospital operator for
22.50 euros a share, 52 percent above yesterday’s closing price.  Deutsche Bank  Deutsche Bank declined 2.8 percent to 33.20 euros after
Germany’s biggest lender said first-quarter profit fell 33
percent to 1.38 billion euros as a rebound in investment-banking
earnings from the previous three months wasn’t enough to match
year-earlier levels. That missed the 1.56 billion-euro average
estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank shares dropped 1.1 percent for the biggest decline
among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. Italy’s borrowing
costs jumped at the sale of 8.5 billion euros of six-month bills
as renewed concern about the spread of the region’s debt crisis
forced the Treasury to offer higher rates to attract investors.  Banco Santander , Spain’s biggest lender, lost 3.4 percent
to 4.75 euros. Unicredit SpA fell 2.8 percent to 3.01 euros in
Milan.  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , France’s second-largest bank,
declined 3.5 percent to 17.62 euros.  Alcatel Slides  Alcatel-Lucent (ALU)  tumbled 17 percent to 1.23 euros after
France’s biggest telecommunications equipment supplier reported
a first-quarter operating loss of 221 million euros, as revenue
trailed analysts’ estimates on lower spending by European
customers.  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  sank 6.1 percent to 2,666.5, the most since
December, 2010 as the U.K.’s second-largest drugmaker cut its
2012 core earnings-per-share  target  to $5.85 to $6.15, from a
previous range of $6 to $6.30. Core EPS in 2011 was $7.28, the
company said in February.  Chief Executive Officer  David Brennan  will also retire from
his post, ending a six-year tenure.  Mobistar Slides  Mobistar SA (MOBB)  declined 14 percent to 29.35 euros. The Belgian
phone company maintained its full-year  forecasts  after reporting
first-quarter profit that missed analyst estimates. Net income
in the three months through March fell 28 percent to 38.2
million euros. Analysts projected profit of 46.6 million euros,
the median of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Logitech (LOGN)  International SA soared 17 percent to 8.28 Swiss
francs. The world’s biggest maker of computer mice reported
earnings that beat estimates and announced measures including
job cuts to save about $80 million a year.  Vivendi SA (VIV)  rallied 4 percent to 13.87 euros. The company is
considering an overhaul of its  structure  that may lead to a
breakup of the owner of the world’s largest music and video-game
companies, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A
Vivendi spokesman said there has been no decision on a review of
corporate structure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
