Chicago ’s “outsized pension
pressures,” unemployment and foreclosure backlog prompted
Moody’s Investors Service to assign a negative outlook today to
the third-largest U.S. city’s general-obligation debt.  Citing Chicago’s “persistent economic challenges,”
Moody’s affirmed the Aa3 rating on $7.78 billion of debt while
changing the outlook from stable.  While the ratings company said Mayor  Rahm Emanuel ’s
administration has addressed infrastructure needs and reduced
reliance on cash reserves, it “has yet to unveil a detailed
strategy for improving pension funding levels.”  Unresolved pension funding shortfalls are the primary
reason for the outlook change, Moody’s said.  “Should the pension pressures continue to escalate absent
a specific plan of reform, the city’s credit quality will likely
weaken,” the opinion said.  The rating applies to general-obligation bond sales
expected May 14. The city is scheduled to sell $540.9 million,
according to Moody’s.  Lois Scott, Chicago’s chief financial officer, said the
Emanuel administration agrees with Moody’s pension concerns. The
burden rests with state lawmakers who “must work together and
fix this funding problem,” Scott said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
