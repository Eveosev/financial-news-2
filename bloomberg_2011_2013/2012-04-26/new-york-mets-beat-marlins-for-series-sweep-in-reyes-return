The  New York Mets  scored two runs
in the bottom of the ninth inning for a 3-2 win over the Miami
Marlins and a three-game series sweep, spoiling  Jose Reyes ’s
return to Citi Field after leaving the franchise as a free agent
in December.  With the bases loaded and one out in the bottom of the
ninth inning, Mets’ pinch hitter  Justin Turner  worked a 13-pitch
at-bat against Miami closer Heath Bell, drawing a walk to tie
the game. With two outs, Kirk Nieuwenhuis singled over the head
of Giancarlo Stanton in right field to win the game.  Jonathon Niese pitched seven innings for the Mets (11-8),
allowing two earned runs on four hits while striking out six
without a walk. Ricky Nolasco also pitched seven innings for
Miami (7-11), giving up an earned run on five hits, with five
strikeouts and a walk.  Reyes, the shortstop who played his first nine Major League
Baseball seasons with the Mets, is averaging .205 with five
doubles and two runs batted in following an 0-for-4 afternoon.  Bell (0-3), who threw 46 pitches and had his third blown
save of the year, took the loss. Ramon Martinez (2-1) pitched
two innings for the victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
