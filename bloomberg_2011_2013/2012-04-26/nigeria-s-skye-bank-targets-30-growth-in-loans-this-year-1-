Skye Bank Plc, (SKYEBANK)  a Nigerian lender,
is targeting 30 percent growth in loans this year and a higher
rate in the next few years, said Chief Executive Officer Kehinde Durosinmi-Etti.  “The bank is looking to attain 40 percent growth in
lending in the next three to five years,” he said on a
conference call today in Lagos, the commercial capital. “Return
on equity is expected at 15 percent this year and to grow to 20
percent in the next three to five years.”  Skye Bank raised $100 million in seven-year debt from
multilateral institutions in December, which will be used to
achieve the lending targets, Durosinmi-Etti said.  “The bank also plans to grow deposits by 40 percent this
year and over the next three to five years,” he said.  Skye Bank’s shares were unchanged at 3.96 naira by the
close in Lagos today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
