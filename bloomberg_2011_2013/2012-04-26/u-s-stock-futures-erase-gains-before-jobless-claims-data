U.S. stock-index futures erased
advances, following two days of gains in the benchmark  Standard
& Poorâ€™s  500 index, before reports on initial jobless claims and
pending home sales.  S&P 500 index futures expiring in June dropped less than
0.1 percent to 1,386.7 at 10:30 a.m. in  London . Dow
Jones Industrial Average futures fell 4 points, less than 0.1
percent, to 13,036 today.  A Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. New York time may
show that initial jobless claims dropped to 375,000 last week
from 386,000 a week earlier, according to the median of 47
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
