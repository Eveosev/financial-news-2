Brevan Howard  Asset Management LLP
co-founder  Alan Howard ’s personal fortune increased 44 percent
over the past year to 1.4 billion pounds ($2.3 billion), putting
him at the top of the annual Sunday Times list of wealthiest
U.K. hedge fund managers.  His net worth was boosted by the 12 percent gain posted in
2011 by Brevan Howard’s biggest hedge fund, the $26 billion
Master Fund. The  investment performance  helped London-based
Brevan Howard generate $1.5 billion of fees, most of which went
to Howard, 48, the Sunday Times said in a statement today.  Howard’s wealth climbed in a year during which most of the
hedge fund industry struggled.  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
and concern that slowing growth in the U.S. would stall led to
volatile financial markets that caused the average hedge fund to
 lose  5.8 percent in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “In difficult times, hedge fund managers are still
surviving and prospering,” said Philip Beresford, who compiled
the list for the Sunday Times. “Although they had a bad 2011,
things seem to have perked up in the first quarter of 2012.”  The U.K. hedge fund manager whose wealth jumped the most
last year was Winton Capital Management LLC founder David Harding, 50. The Cambridge University-educated physicist now has
a personal fortune of 800 million pounds, up 95 percent from
2011, according to the Sunday Times, which will publish its full
“ Rich List ” of Britain’s wealthiest people on April 29.  Winton Futures  Harding’s $10.2 billion Winton Futures Fund Ltd., which
relies on computer models to spot trades in  futures markets ,
gained 6.3 percent in 2011, Bloomberg data show. Winton’s firm-
wide assets have increased by about $10 billion to $29 billion
since 2010, boosting Harding’s wealth because  hedge funds 
generate fees for managing client money. The Winton Futures Fund
charges a 1 percent management fee, less than the 2 percent
industry standard.  Spokesmen for Brevan Howard and Winton declined to comment.  Howard and Bluecrest Capital Management Ltd. co-founder
 Michael Platt , 44, have remained on the Sunday Times list even
though both men moved to  Switzerland  in 2010 as the U.K. was
preparing to increase taxes for high-earners. Platt’s wealth
rose 24 percent to 650 million pounds since 2011, according to
the Sunday Times.  Some hedge fund managers on the list increased their net
worth even though they lost money for clients last year. Crispin Odey’s Odey European Inc. fund declined 20 percent in 2011,
according to Bloomberg data. His wealth rose to 455 million
pounds from 453 million pounds, the Sunday Times estimated.  Coffey, Clive Capital  Greg Coffey, co-chief investment officer of Moore Capital
Management LLC’s European business, lost 6.2 percent through the
first 10 months of 2011 in what was previously his biggest hedge
fund, people with knowledge of the matter said this month. He
then gained 1.1 percent in the last two months of the year after
the amount of money in his fund was reduced and he rebranded its
name, according to investors. Coffey’s wealth increased to 260
million pounds from 252 million pounds, the Sunday Times said.  Clive Capital LLP founder  Chris Levett  appeared on the
Sunday Times list for the first time this year with a net worth
of 250 million pounds after his fund lost 10 percent in 2011.  The broader Sunday Times list of the 1,000 wealthiest
people included 54 hedge fund managers. The newspaper bases its
findings on information available in public records, including
real estate, art holdings and shares in public companies. The
estimates exclude bank accounts.  Following is the Sunday Times list of the top 20 wealthiest
hedge fund managers in British pounds, along with their
estimated wealth a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
