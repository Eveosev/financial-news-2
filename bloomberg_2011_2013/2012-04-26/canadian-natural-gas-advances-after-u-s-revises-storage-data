Canadian natural gas rose after the
U.S. Energy Department revised its estimate of gas in storage,
cutting its official stockpile number by 11 billion cubic feet.  Alberta  gas advanced 0.3 percent. U.S. inventories gained
47 billion cubic feet to 2.548 trillion in the week ended April
20, the Energy Department said today. An increase of 45 billion
was expected, according to analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The department revised the total reported last week.  “The bottom line is that it lowered stocks by 11 billion
cubic feet,” said Kyle Cooper, director of research with IAF
Advisors in Houston.  Alberta gas for May delivery rose 0.5 cent to C$1.58 a
gigajoule ($1.53 per million British thermal units) as of 3:20
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 45 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 3.2 cents to settle at $2.036 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
9.68 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $2.2191 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 10.17 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $1.9354 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices gained 9.13 cents, or 4.8 percent, to
$2.0085.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet, 345 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.21 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.89 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 980 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.67 billion cubic feet today, or 63 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.04
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
