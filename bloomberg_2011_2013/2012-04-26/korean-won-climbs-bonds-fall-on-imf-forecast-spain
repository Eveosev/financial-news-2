South  Korea ’s won rose for the
first time in three days after data showed the economy expanded
at the fastest pace in a year and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said more U.S. stimulus will be provided if necessary.
 Government bonds  were little changed.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.9 percent in the first
quarter from the previous three months, when it gained 0.3
percent, the Bank of Korea said today. U.S. policy makers
upgraded their forecasts for this year’s growth and the labor
market yesterday, while repeating their view that borrowing
costs are likely to remain “exceptionally low” at least
through late 2014. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of shares rose for the first
time in six days.  The won gained 0.3 percent to 1,138.18 per dollar as of
9:30 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, fell 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 7.62 percent.  “External factors are favorable for the won today,” said
Kim Sung Soon, chief currency dealer at the Industrial  Bank of
Korea  in Seoul. “Risks related with  North Korea  persist, but I
expect this issue to affect currency markets only if their
action really happens.”  North Korea’s state media said this week that a special
action squad will turn South’s government into ashes within
three to four minutes using “unprecedented peculiar means and
methods of our own style.” North Korea regularly threatens
attacks on South and its government.  The Fed now sees the U.S. jobless rate for this year at
between 7.8 percent and 8 percent, compared with a January
estimate of 8.2 percent to 8.5 percent. The economy is forecast
to expand 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent, compared with a previous
prediction of 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent.  The yield on  South Korea ’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 was steady at 3.50 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
Three-year debt futures and the one-year interest-rate swap were
little changed at 104.05 and 3.51 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
