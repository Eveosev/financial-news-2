Uganda  plans in July to start
building a $350 million Chinese-funded toll road linking Entebbe
International Airport and the capital, Kampala, to reduce
congestion, the Uganda National Roads Authority said.  The 37-kilometer (23-mile) dual carriageway, with an
additional 13-kilometer spur, will be financed through a four-
year loan from the  Export-Import Bank of China , the authority
said in an advertisement published today in Daily Monitor
newspaper. The existing 36-kilometer Kampala-Entebbe road
experiences regular congestion, it said.  China is one of the main sources of foreign direct
investment for the East African country, which is on the cusp of
an oil boom, according to the  Uganda Investment Authority . The
state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp. has partnered
 Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and Total SA in the development of discoveries in
Uganda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
