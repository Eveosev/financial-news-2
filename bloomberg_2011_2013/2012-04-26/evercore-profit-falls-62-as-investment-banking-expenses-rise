Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the
advisory firm founded by  Roger Altman , said first-quarter profit
fell 62 percent as expenses in the firm’s investment-banking
unit climbed.  Earnings excluding certain items fell to $4.32 million, or
10 cents per share, from $11.4 million, or 28 cents, in the
year-earlier period, the New York-based firm said in a statement
today. The average estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for adjusted earnings of 33 cents a share.
Expenses at the firm’s investment banking business climbed to
$77.5 million from $61.7 million.  Led by Chief Executive Officer Ralph Schlosstein, Evercore
is among investment banks facing declines in mergers-and-
acquisitions volume as concern about the European debt crisis
and weaker economic growth delay transactions. The amount of
globally announced and completed deals fell for the third
consecutive quarter in the three months ended March 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Our business in any given quarter is affected by the
timing of transaction closings, over which we virtually have no
control,” Schlosstein, 61, said in the statement. “Despite our
disappointing first quarter in advisory, all indications suggest
that our performance for the full-year will again be strong.”  Evercore rose 1.8 percent to close at $25.05 yesterday in
 New York  and has lost 5.9 percent  this year . Bank of America
Corp. this month cut its rating on Evercore’s stock after
slower-than-expected M&A business in the first quarter and a
drop in the firm’s publicly announced pipeline of deals.  Advisory Fees  Adjusted net revenue, at $105.5 million in the first
quarter, was unchanged from the same period a year earlier. Net
revenue from the investment banking unit rose to $85 million
from $80.6 million, and net revenue from the investment
management division fell to $20.5 million from $24.9 million.  Evercore earned advisory fees from 104 clients in the first
quarter, up from 79 last year, and received fees of more than $1
million from 17 clients, compared with 18 a year ago.  Assets under management fell 25 percent from the year-
earlier period to $12.9 billion at March 31 as money flowed out
of the firm’s institutional business, Evercore said. Investment
advisory and management fees declined to $18.7 million from $23
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
