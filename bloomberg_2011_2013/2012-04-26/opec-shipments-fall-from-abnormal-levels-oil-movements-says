The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will trim shipments from unusually high
levels through to the middle of May as demand from Asian
refiners declines, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC will export 24.13 million barrels a day in the four
weeks to May 12, compared with 24.15 million a day in the period
to April 14, the researcher said in an e-mailed report today.
The data exclude  Angola  and Ecuador.  “It’s entirely down to lower eastern shipments,” Roy Mason, the company’s founder, said by telephone from Halifax in
 England . “This is one of the low points of the year. Levels
have been much too high for the season, something abnormal has
gone on.”  Exports from the  Middle East , including non-OPEC members
Oman and Yemen, will decline 0.4 percent to 17.9 million barrels
a day in the four-week period, according to the report.  Crude on board tankers will average 501.45 million barrels
in the four weeks, up 1.8 percent from the month to April 14,
Oil Movements said.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-
rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships
as floating storage.  OPEC’s members, which pump 40 percent of the world’s oil,
are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
