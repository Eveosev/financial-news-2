Equatorial Guinea  plans to increase
exports of Aseng crude to three cargoes in June, according to a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The June program comprises shipments of 950,000 barrels,
750,000 barrels and 650,000 barrels, the plan showed. This
compares with two 950,000-barrel lots, according to a revised
May program.  Ghana  will keep its exports of Jubilee crude for June
unchanged at two 950,000-barrel consignments, while Cameroon
will ship one 800,000-barrel lot of Kole grade in June, compared
with three cargoes totaling 2.14 million barrels for May,
according to separate plans.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
