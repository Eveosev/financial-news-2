Ethanol futures climbed in  Chicago 
as overseas demand for corn signaled higher production costs for
the biofuel.  Prices rose along with corn after the Agriculture
Department said sales of the grain for delivery before Aug. 31,
2013, were more than double the level a week earlier. In the
first three days of this week, the department reported sales to
 China  and unknown destinations totaling 1.28 million metric
tons. Ethanol in the U.S. is derived from corn.  “It just followed the corn market,” said John Janney, a
vice president at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 0.1 cent to settle
at $2.154 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
dropped 2.2 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.14 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf at $2.20, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast fell 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$2.29 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel sank 3.5 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $2.235.  Corn futures for July delivery advanced 6.5 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $6.075 a bushel in Chicago, the first increase in
three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
