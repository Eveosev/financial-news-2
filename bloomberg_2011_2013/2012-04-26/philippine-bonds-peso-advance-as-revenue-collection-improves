Philippine bonds and the peso
advanced as Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said tax collection
is improving, strengthening the nation’s finances and increasing
the chance of a credit-rating upgrade.  Revenue targets are set to be ambitious, Purisima said in
an ABS-CBN News Channel interview today. The  budget deficit  was
33.9 billion pesos ($796 million) in the first quarter, less
than the 82.8 billion peso target, the Bureau of the Treasury
said yesterday.  “Markets should take the budget news positively,” said
Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “The
move to plug tax loopholes is in the right direction. Ratings
agencies are looking at sustainable increases in tax
collection.”  The yield on 5.75 percent government bonds due November
2021 dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
5.48 percent as of 11:14 a.m. in Manila, according to Tradition
Financial Services. The peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 42.625
per dollar, prices from Tullett Prebon Plc show. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, fell 68 basis points to 4.08 percent.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is watchful of domestic
inflation dynamics and is monitoring capital flows that
complicate monetary policy, Governor Amando Tetangco said today.
Policy makers must have all options on the table and the U.S.
Federal Reserve “echoes the view that the problems the global
economy faces are multifaceted and require an enhanced policy
tool kit,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
