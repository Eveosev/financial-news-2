U.K. stocks  advanced for a third
day, after swinging between gains and losses, as Unilever Plc
and Royal Dutch Shell Group Plc posted financial results that
beat forecasts, outweighing worse-than-expected economic reports
in the U.S. and  Europe .  Unilever, the world’s second-biggest consumer goods
company, and Shell, Europe’s largest oil producer, climbed more
than 2.5 percent each.  AstraZeneca (AZN)  Plc fell the most since 2010
after the drugmaker cut its profit forecast.  Admiral Group Plc (ADM) 
dropped after reporting a slowdown in sales.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index rose 29.83 points, or 0.5 percent, to
5,748.72 in London after fluctuating between gains and losses at
least 12 times. The measure has dropped 3.6 percent from its
2012 high in March as concern resurfaced that some countries in
Europe will struggle to reduce deficits and service their debt.
The FTSE All-Share Index added 0.5 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index slipped 0.4 percent.  “Indecision reigned today where a volatile session
indicated just how investors are still unsure as to whether the
good corporate earnings season is enough to discount the
overriding storm clouds that still shroud the macro picture,”
said  Angus Campbell , head of market analysis at Capital Spreads
in London.  Euro-Area Confidence  A report today showed  economic confidence  in the euro area
declined more than economists forecast in April, as the region’s
slump showed signs of deepening. An index of executive and
consumer sentiment fell to 92.8 from a revised 94.5 in March,
the European Commission said. Economists had forecast a drop to
94.2, according to the median estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Italy’s borrowing costs jumped at the sale of 8.5 billion
euros ($11.3 billion) of six-month bills amid renewed concern
about the spread of the region’s debt crisis. The Treasury sold
the debt at a rate of 1.772 percent, up from 1.119 percent at
the previous auction on March 28.  “We have been consistently bearish on European equities,”
Stuart Richardson, who helps oversee $70 million at RMG Wealth
Management in  London , said in a phone interview. “For the next
two to three years, we like several companies in the region
whose growth drivers come from overseas, but we are just worried
about the overall event risk in Europe.”  U.S. Jobless Claims  In the U.S., more people than forecast filed applications
for  unemployment benefits  last week, a sign that the labor
market is taking time to improve. Jobless claims fell by 1,000
to 388,000 in the week ended April 21 from a revised 389,000 the
prior period that was the highest since early January, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
a drop to 375,000.  Unilever (ULVR)  advanced 2.7 percent to 2,135 pence after
reporting an 8.4 percent increase in underlying sales last
quarter that beat the average analyst estimate for a 6.4 percent
gain, according to a survey conducted by the company. Units sold
increased 3.5 percent, more than double the forecast.  The company also said it’s “on track” to deliver a modest
improvement in full-year core operating margin, weighted toward
the second half of the year.  “However one cuts it, it’s a strong first quarter,”
analysts at Deutsche Bank AG wrote in a report today. The
company “will probably be one of a few to show recovery in
volumes in spite of good pricing,” they added.  Shell Asset Sales  Shell increased 3.2 percent to 2,195.5 pence after first-
quarter earnings beat estimates and the company raised a target
for asset sales this year. Excluding one-time items and
inventory changes, Shell posted a profit of $7.28 billion,
compared with the $6.7 billion average analyst estimate.  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  jumped 6.2 percent to 1,921 pence after the
owner of Premier Inn budget lodges reported an 11 percent
increase in full-year pretax profit. The company posted earnings
per share of 134.1 pence, beating analyst estimates.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  gained 3.5 percent to 50.35 pence after
the homebuilder reported a 23 percent increase in the value of
its order book since the year end and said trading is at the
“upper end of expectations.”  AstraZeneca fell 6.1 percent to 2,666.5 pence, the biggest
drop since December 2010. The drugmaker cut its 2012 core
earnings-per share target to $5.85 from $6.15, compared with a
previous range of $6 to $6.30. The company said first-quarter
revenue sank because of “challenging market conditions” and
the loss of patent protection on several medicines.  The company also announced that Chief Executive Officer
 David Brennan  will retire from his post, ending a six-year
tenure after repeated failures in  drug development  left
investors skeptical of the company’s earnings prospects.  Admiral lost 2.9 percent to 1,195 pence, paring the gain
this year to 40 percent. The company said it made a “good
start” to the year as first-quarter sales rose 9 percent to 586
million pounds ($948 million). The pace of growth declined from
20 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 56 percent in the
first quarter a year earlier, according to analysts at  RBC
Capital Markets .  To contact the reporters on this story:
