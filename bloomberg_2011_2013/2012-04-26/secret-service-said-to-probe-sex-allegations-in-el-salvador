The U.S. Secret Service is
investigating the accuracy of a news report saying agents paid
for “sexual favors” in an El Salvador strip club and brought
escorts to their hotel rooms prior to a visit by President
 Barack Obama  last year, an agency official said.  The report, by Seattle television station KIRO, quoted an
unidentified witness saying he joined the agents at the club in San
Salvador in the days before President Barack Obama arrived in
March 2011.  The agency official, who wasn’t authorized to speak
publicly, declined to provide additional details about the
probe.  The agency has come under scrutiny after 12 employees were
linked to a prostitution scandal that occurred in Cartagena,
 Colombia , before a visit by Obama earlier this month. Nine of
those employees are leaving the agency or are being forced out.  “The recent investigation in Cartagena has generated
several news stories that contain allegations by mostly unnamed
sources,” said Max Milien, a Secret Service spokesman in a
statement. “Any information brought to our attention that can
be assessed as credible will be followed up on in an appropriate
manner.”  Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano yesterday told
the Senate Judiciary Committee she knew of no other incidents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
