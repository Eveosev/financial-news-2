Midwest gasoline and jet fuel rose
against futures after a  ConocoPhillips (COP)  refinery in Ponca City,
 Oklahoma , reported an unspecified malfunction to the state.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest narrowed 1.25 cents to 18 cents a gallon below futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the smallest discount for the fuel
since April 3.  The company filed a notice with the Oklahoma Department of
Environmental Quality on April 24. Paula Cain, director of Ponca
City’s emergency management division, said the refinery flared
gases that night.  The refinery in Ponca City is the largest in Oklahoma and
can process 187,000 barrels a day. It produces gasoline, diesel
and jet fuel, among other products.  The premium for Midwest jet fuel versus heating oil futures
traded on the exchange rose 3.25 cents to 6 cents a gallon,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest
premium since Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
