Peter Son, a  California  man, and
his companies SNC Asset Management and SNC Investments were
ordered by a court to pay a $5 million civil penalty in a
foreign-exchange fraud case brought by the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission.  Son solicited $85 million from 500 customers for foreign
exchange trading that he falsely claimed was profitable, the
CFTC said in an e-mailed statement today. Rather than trade for
customers, Son used the money to pay earlier investors in the
 Ponzi scheme  and for mortgage debt, country club dues and
payments to his wife, the agency said.  The April 19 order by U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney in
San Francisco resolves a CFTC lawsuit against Son. He pleaded
guilty in 2010 to a related criminal case and was sentenced to
15 years in prison and ordered to pay $60 million in
restitution, the agency said.  The civil case is CFTC v. Son, 09-2555, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
