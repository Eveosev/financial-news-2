Kenedix Residential Investment
Corp. (3278) , the first Japanese real estate investment trust to sell
shares in more than four years, fell on the first day of trading
in Tokyo on concerns that its property holdings are too small.  The shares fell 4.7 percent to 181,000 yen at the close on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, compared with the IPO price of 190,000
yen. The Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index lost 1.1 percent.  The IPO is the first for a Japanese REIT since  Industrial &
Infrastructure Fund Investment Corp. (3249)  sold shares in October 2007.
Others including  Japan Real Estate Investment Corp. (8952)  and  Nippon
Building Fund Inc. (8951)  have announced plans this year for public
offerings to fund property acquisitions and pay down debt.  “Kenedix’s portfolio is very small and not as
competitive,”  Yoji Otani , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in
Tokyo, said. Still, “Kenedix’s performance shouldn’t discourage
other companies from going public.”  Kenedix’s REIT will manage 30.5 billion yen ($375 million)
of rental apartments mainly in the Tokyo metropolitan area,
according to a filing with Japan’s Ministry of Finance on March
23. That compares with 231.9 billion yen of apartments that
Nippon Accommodation Fund Inc. owns in its fund and Advance
Residence Investment’s REIT with 341.8 billion yen of assets.  Property Recovery  J-REITs are selling shares on expectations for a recovery
in property prices and as the  Bank of Japan  said it added 10
trillion yen to an asset-purchase program on Feb. 14. The
monetary easing will help boost land prices in the six major
cities by 10 percent, Otani said.  They may sell as much as 500 billion yen worth of shares
through secondary offerings in 2012, compared with the 223.8
billion yen they sold last year, according to an estimate by
Otani.  Global Logistic Properties Ltd. (GLP) , a unit of the Government
of Singapore Investment Corp., is preparing an initial public
offering of its Japanese warehouse assets that may raise about
$1 billion, said three people with knowledge of the matter in
March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
