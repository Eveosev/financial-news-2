Two cargoes of Nigerian Usan crude
for loading in May have been deferred to June, according to a
revised shipping schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  Exports for May will be reduced to three shipments from
five, which includes one lot deferred from April, the plan
showed. All cargoes are for 950,000 barrels each.  The Usan field, operated by  Total SA (FP) , started production in
February and has a capacity to pump 180,000 barrels a day.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
