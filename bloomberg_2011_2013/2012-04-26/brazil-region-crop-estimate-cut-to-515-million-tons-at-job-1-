Sugar-cane growers in  Brazil ’s
center south will harvest less than expected in the current crop
year because of dry weather in the first quarter that cut
yields, JOB Economia & Planejamento said.  The forecast for the region, where about 90 percent of the
country’s sugar and ethanol is produced, was cut to 515 million
metric tons from 530 million tons estimated on Feb. 15, the Sao
Paulo-based researcher said in an e-mailed statement. Center
south’s sugar output is seen at 32.8 million tons for the crop
year started April 1.  “Crop yields are disappointing,” JOB partner Julio Maria
Borges said today in a phone interview from  Sao Paulo . “In
order to offset lower crop yields, mills have decided to delay
crushing to boost sucrose content.”  Center south is the main growing region in Brazil, the
world’s largest producer and exporter of sugar.  Latin America ’s
largest economy produces about half of global exports of the
sweetener.  Most mills in center south will start crushing in May,
about a month later than in previous years, Borges said, to
allow cane plants to accumulate more sucrose, the substance
that’s turned into sugar and ethanol.  Sugar shipments from Brazil will increase 5 percent to 26.2
million tons, from 24.95 million tons in the previous crop year.  Raw sugar for July delivery fell 1.7 percent to 21.42 cents
a pound by 11:54 a.m. on ICE Futures in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
