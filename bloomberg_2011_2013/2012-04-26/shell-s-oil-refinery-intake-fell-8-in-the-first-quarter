Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
biggest oil company, said refinery intake volumes decreased by 8
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.  The amount processed at Shell’s refineries fell by 248,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day to 2.78 million barrels a day,
The Hague-based Shell said today in a statement.  Shell increased availability of its refineries to 94
percent in the first quarter, up from 92 percent in the same
period last year. The completion of the expansion project at
Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Port Arthur refinery in  Texas  more than
doubled total capacity at the plant to 600,000 barrels a day,
with crude processing starting earlier this month, the company
said.  Motiva is a refining and marketing joint venture of Saudi
Refining Inc., a subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., and
Shell’s U.S. oil unit. Shell owns 50 percent of the refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
