European financial regulators
should do more to harmonize penalties for insider-traders and
market manipulators, the region’s top markets regulator said.  Fines for insider-trading have ranged from 64 euros ($84)
to 6 million euros across the European Union’s 27 member states,
according to a report by the Paris-based  European Securities and
Markets Authority . Meanwhile, the number of staff at national
supervisors dedicated to market enforcement ranged from two to
127, ESMA said in the study.  “While most authorities have made use” of market-abuse
sanctions “differences remain in their availability,
regulators’ ability to use them and the allocation of re-
sources,” Steven Maijoor, chairman of ESMA, said in an e-mailed
statement.  The European Commission is currently reviewing the region’s
Market Abuse Directive as part of an overhaul of financial
regulation following the 2008 financial crisis and national
supervisors are cracking down on abuse.  David Einhorn , chairman
of Greenlight Capital Inc. was fined 3.6 million pounds ($5.8
million) by the U.K.’s  Financial Services Authority  in January
for trading on inside information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
