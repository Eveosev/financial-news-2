Shire Plc (SHP)  reported a 20 percent
increase in first-quarter earnings per share as doctors
prescribed more of the Vyvanse and Intuniv attention-deficit
drugs.  First-quarter earnings excluding some items were $1.48 per
American depositary receipt, compared with $1.23 a year earlier,
Shire said today in a statement. Earnings missed the  average
estimate  of $1.49 per depositary receipt from 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The U.K. maker of the Adderall hyperactivity pill has been
benefiting from an expansion of the market for drugs to treat
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The company has been
widening the use of Vyvanse since the pill won U.S. approval to
treat children ages 6 to 12 in 2007. Vyvanse is now also cleared
to treat adolescents and adults with the disorder. Shire said in
a separate statement that Vyvanse met goals of a trial of
patients with binge-eating disorder.  “Vyvanse and Intuniv are beneficiaries” of the expanding
U.S. market for such treatments, Citigroup Inc. analysts wrote
in a note to clients on April 19. “These trends will continue
during 2012, we believe, as the ADHD market benefits from
increased penetration of the adult patient population group.”  Shire, based in Dublin with management offices in
Basingstoke,  England , said sales climbed 21 percent to $1.17
billion.  Vyvanse Sales  Sales of Vyvanse increased 29 percent to $260 million,
while Intuniv brought in $68.5 million. The drug’s revenue will
probably exceed $1 billion this year, Shire said. Adderall XR
sales were $111.4 million.  Shire shares fell 0.5 percent to 1,993 pence as of 12:12
p.m. in  London . The stock has declined 11 percent this year.  Shire repeated a warning in February that 2012 gross
margins would be “marginally lower,” reflecting costs from the
$750 million acquisition of Advanced BioHealing Inc. Research,
sales and administrative costs are expected rise between 12
percent to 14 percent higher than those in 2011, Shire said
today.  Shire has faced several setbacks in the quarter. The
company in March dropped an application to gain Food and Drug
Administration approval for Fabry disease therapy Replagal,
leading one analyst to cut his peak sales forecast for the drug
by $95 million. Last month, Shire’s Lialda for ulcerative
colitis failed in a trial that would have expanded its use to
new patients.  The company was also expecting U.S. approval by the end of
the first quarter for a new plant outside of  Boston  that would
have expanded capacity for the Vpriv treatment for Gaucher
disease. The FDA sent Shire a complete response letter, and the
company is working with the agency to address remaining
questions.  Revenue from Replagal rose 28 percent to $134.4 million,
beating an average estimate of $124.8 million. Sales of Vpriv
climbed 22 percent to $71.7 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
