Joel Ward scored his first goal of
the National Hockey League playoffs in overtime to send the
 Washington Capitals  into the second round at the expense of the
defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins.  The Capitals won 2-1 in the decisive seventh game at TD
Garden in Boston last night.  Matt Hendricks gave the Capitals a 1-0 lead in the first
period and Tyler Seguin tied the game at 1-1 for the Bruins in
the second period.  After a scoreless third period, Ward hit a 17-foot backhand
shot two minutes, 57 seconds into overtime.  The first round concludes tonight as the Ottawa Senators
visit the  New York Rangers  and the Florida Panthers host the  New
Jersey Devils  in the seventh games of their series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
