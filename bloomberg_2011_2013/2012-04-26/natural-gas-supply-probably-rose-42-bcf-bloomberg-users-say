The U.S. Energy Department’s
natural-gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington , will show that supplies rose 1.7 percent
last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories gained 42 billion cubic feet in the week ended April
20 to 2.554 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for May delivery rose 6.5 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $2.133 per million British thermal units on the New
