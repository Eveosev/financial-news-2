India’s rupee advanced for a second
day on speculation U.S. policy makers’ efforts to spur the
world’s largest economy will help boost global growth.  The rupee extended its rebound from a three-month low after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that
he’s prepared to do more to stimulate American growth if needed.
International investors poured $8.8 billion into Indian equities
this year, almost eight times the inflows a year earlier,
exchange data show.  “Growth of the U.S. economy will spur investor confidence
across the globe,” said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at state-
run  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai. “India and the rupee will benefit
because economic growth will boost fundamentals and encourage
investments in  emerging markets  as well.”  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 51.44 per dollar as of
9:35 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency may advance to 52.30 this week, Babu forecast.  The Fed said the  U.S. economy  will grow 2.4 percent to 2.9
percent in 2012, from a previous prediction of 2.2 percent to
2.7 percent. South Korea’s gross domestic product rose 0.9
percent in the first quarter from the previous three months,
when it gained 0.3 percent, the  Bank of Korea  said today.  Three-month  offshore  non-deliverable forward contracts
traded at 53.65 a dollar, compared with 53.76 yesterday.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
