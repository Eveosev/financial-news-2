New York’s financial regulator has
called for hearings to probe whether insurers’ rates are too
high for mortgage borrowers who lapsed on their previous
residential policies.  The Department of Financial Services has told 15 financial
firms, including banks, mortgage servicers and insurers, to
provide testimony, according to a statement today from
Superintendent  Benjamin Lawsky . The first hearing is scheduled
for May 17 in Manhattan.  Mortgage firms hire new insurance providers to shield
against losses tied to storm damage or vandalism when borrowers
fail to pay their premiums. The state review will focus on the
relationships between the companies that force borrowers to take
the coverage.  “We will use the information gathered at the hearings to
determine whether force-placed insurance rates are justified or
need correction,” Lawsky said. “We are looking into all
aspects of this industry, and will take whatever action is
necessary to root out any misconduct and to make sure that
homeowners and investors are treated fairly.”  Insurers including New York-based  Assurant Inc. (AIZ) ,  Germany ’s
Munich Re and Australia’s  QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE) , sell the
coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
