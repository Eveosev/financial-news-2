President  Dmitry Medvedev  said he
can’t free  Mikhail Khodorkovsky  unless the imprisoned former
Yukos Oil Co. owner asks for a pardon.  “Without an appeal, there can’t be any examination” of
Khodorkovsky’s potential release, Medvedev, who will replace
 Vladimir Putin  as prime minister next month, said in a televised
interview today with major Russian channels.  Medvedev’s human rights council urged him to pardon
Khodorkovsky, arguing in a legal recommendation that he can do
so without the businessman formally requesting a presidential
pardon, which involves admitting his guilt.  Khodorkovsky, 48, once Russia’s richest man, is serving 13
years in prison under two separate convictions for fraud, tax
evasion and oil embezzlement that he says are retribution for
funding opposition parties under then-President Putin. The
government denies the accusations. Khodorkovsky was arrested at
gunpoint on the tarmac of a Siberian airport in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
