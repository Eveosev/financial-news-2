Repligen Corp. (RGEN) , a biotechnology
company developing treatments for rare conditions, said it
expects the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  to ask for more
information about its pancreatic imaging treatment. The shares
plunged the most in eight years.  The FDA, which was scheduled to decide whether to approve
the drug by June 21, canceled a May meeting of advisers to
review the compound, RG1068, Repligen said in a statement today.
The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company anticipates regulators
will ask for additional clinical trial information.  “While we are disappointed in this result, we continue to
believe that RG1068 is a safe and effective agent for imaging of
the pancreatic ducts, and that it has the potential to meet a
significant unmet patient need,” Walter Herlihy, president and
chief executive officer of Repligen, said in the statement.  Repligen fell 40 percent to $4.34 at the close of trading,
the most since January 2004. The  shares  had more than doubled
this year through yesterday.  The FDA notified the company midday yesterday about the
meeting cancellation. Repligen plans to work with the agency to
assess a potential path forward, Herlihy said.  The experimental drug is a synthetic version of human
secretin that improved detection of pancreatic duct
abnormalities in combination with MRI in patients with
pancreatitis during a final-phase study, according to Repligen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
