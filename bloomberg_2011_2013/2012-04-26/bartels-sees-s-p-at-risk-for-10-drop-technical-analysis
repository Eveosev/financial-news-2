The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  may
lose as much as 10 percent from current levels given the
market’s tendency to give back some gains after a “strong”
rally, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Mary Ann Bartels.  The benchmark measure of U.S. equities jumped 29 percent
between Oct. 3 and April 2, when it closed at 1,419.04. The
index has since declined to 1,390.69. Bartels said in an April
24 note that one-third to one-half of the six-month advance
could be lost, pushing the index down to 1,250 or 1,300. The
report came out before the S&P 500 surged 1.4 percent yesterday.  “We’re in a correction,” Bartels, the New York-based head
of technical and market analysis at Bank of America, said in a
phone interview yesterday. “We’re starting to get sell signals
on our intermediate indicators.”  Equities stalled this month after the  S&P 500  jumped 12
percent in the biggest first-quarter rally since 1998. The
benchmark index started this month by declining for  two straight
weeks  for the first time since November as  consumer confidence 
dropped,  China ’s growth slowed and the cost of insuring against
a Spanish default rose to a record.  Industries such as consumer staples, telecommunications and
utilities have fallen too much as investors favor more
“defensive” industries, Bartels said. Stocks driven by the
economy, including materials, energy and industrial shares, have
fallen out of favor, pointing to a potential “deeper pullback”
for the U.S. equity market, she said.  “The market is still staying away from commodity-sensitive
cyclicals,” Bartels said. “As long as that continues, that
means the market is more likely to go down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
