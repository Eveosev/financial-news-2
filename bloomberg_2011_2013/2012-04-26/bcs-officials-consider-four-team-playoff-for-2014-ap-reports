Bowl Championship Series officials
are considering a four-team playoff as they discuss how a
college football champion will be determined starting in 2014,
the  Associated Press  reported.  The group will meet again today to narrow the number of
scenarios for the postseason, BCS Executive Director Bill
Hancock told AP. The focus is on two national semifinals and a
title game.  “I think that’s what everyone wants to do, get down to two,
maybe three,” Hancock said, according to AP. “We’re making
good progress on that. I think we’re going to make it.”  The four-team playoff still has variables: where the games
are played, how the contenders are selected and how the current
bowl games fit into the plan, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
