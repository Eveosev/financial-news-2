     April 26 (Bloomberg) -- China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , the
nation’s biggest publicly traded shipping company, posted a
wider first-quarter loss because of higher fuel prices and lower
fees for carrying containers and commodities.  The net loss widened to 2.67 billion yuan ($423 million)
from 502 million yuan a year earlier, the Tianjin, China-based
company said in a  Hong Kong  stock exchange filing today. Sales
fell 4.6 percent to 15.7 billion yuan.  Average rates at Cosco’s container-shipping unit,  Asia ’s
biggest, fell 15 percent from a year earlier, according to
Bloomberg calculations, as carriers competed to fill expanding
fleets and the European debt crisis stymied demand. Commodity-
shipping volumes declined 15 percent from a year earlier, while
rates plunged industrywide amid overcapacity.  “The dry-bulk industry supply imbalance is likely to
worsen this year,” Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts led by Andrew Lee said in an April 23 note. They also said China Cosco would
return to profit only in 2014, compared with an earlier
prediction for next year. The  company  had a full-year loss of
10.5 billion yuan in 2011.  Cosco’s average Asia-Europe container rates fell 18
percent, based on numbers in the statement. Volumes on the route
rose 21 percent, while revenue fell 9.8 percent. Trans-Pacific
shipments rose 21 percent, more than double the increase in
sales.  First-quarter fuel prices averaged 22 percent higher than a
year earlier in Singapore trading, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a benchmark for commodity-
shipping rates, was 36 percent lower.  The shipping line, which also has a stake in container-
terminal operator  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , fell 1.5 percent to
HK$4.51 in Hong Kong trading today before the earnings
announcement. It’s risen 18 percent this year, outperforming the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index ’s 13 percent gain.  China Cosco had a fleet of 376 owned and leased dry-bulk
ships as of March 31, compared with 374 three months earlier,
according to the statement. Its container-ship fleet totaled 159
ships, with another 30 on order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
