German  government bonds  stayed
higher after a report showed economic confidence in the euro
area region declined more than economists forecast in April.  The yield on the 10-year bund fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 10:04 a.m. London
time. Two-year yields fell one basis point to 0.11 percent.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area fell to 92.8 from a revised 94.5 in March, the
European Commission in Brussels said today. Economists had
forecast a drop to 94.2 from a previously reported 94.4, the
median of 29 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
