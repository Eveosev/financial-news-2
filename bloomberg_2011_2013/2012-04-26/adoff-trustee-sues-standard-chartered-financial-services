The trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff’s defunct firm sued  Standard Chartered  Financial Services
(Luxembourg) SA to recoup about $329.7 million allegedly
received from the so-called feeder fund Fairfield Sentry Ltd.  Irving Picard, the trustee, filed the suit today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan to recover what he called
“customer property” from companies that invested with
Fairfield Sentry.  All the transfers to the entities sued were derived from
investments made with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC by Fairfield Sentry, a fund managed by Fairfield Greenwich
Group, Picard said. Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence
for running the biggest  Ponzi scheme  in history.  The funds were “subsequent transfers of customer
property” made to the defendants, according to Picard’s
complaint.  Standard Chartered is incorporated and organized under the
laws of  Luxembourg , Picard said.  The case is Picard v. Standard Chartered Financial Services
(Luxembourg) SA, 12-01565, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
