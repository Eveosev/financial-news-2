Bizim Toptan Satis Magazalari AS (BIZIM) , a
Turkish chain of wholesale stores, gained the most in almost 15
months after first-quarter revenue rose.  The shares gained 5.6 percent to 26.30 liras at the close
in Istanbul, the highest since February 2011. Sales grew 18
percent to 429.2 million liras ($242.9 million), Bizim said in a
statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  after the market closed
yesterday.  Net income increased to 7.03 million liras, compared with
5.96 million liras a year ago, missing the 7.66 million-lira
average based on five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The company is likely to make up for the small earnings
miss in the rest of the year,” brokerage EFG Istanbul
Securities said in an e-mailed report to clients. The stock is
trading at an “attractive” multiple of enterprise value to
sales, EFG said.  Bizim’s enterprise value is 0.57 times sales, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
