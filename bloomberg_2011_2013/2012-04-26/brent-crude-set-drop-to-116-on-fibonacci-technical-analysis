Brent is set to decline toward a
Fibonacci level close to $116 a barrel in  London  after prices
encountered a key resistance level, according to Barclays Plc.  Brent traded at about $119 a barrel on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London today, having lost about 5 percent
this month. Prices have remained below $121.50, a threshold in
line with the commodity’s lowest points over the past three
months, since April 13, according to a report dated yesterday.
Brent’s failure to break through this level signals it’s more
likely to drop than rise, according to the bank.  “Former range lows near $121.50 act as resistance and keep
our focus lower for Brent,” analysts including  Philip Roberts 
in London and Jordan Kotick in New York wrote. “Our initial
targets are in the $116.30 to $116.60 area.”  Those levels represent a 62 percent retracement of Brent’s
rally to $128.40 a barrel last month. The significance of a 62
percent movement comes from the Fibonacci sequence of ratios
used by traders to predict points of resistance and support.  A drop below $116.30 “signals downside extension,”
Barclays said, without specifying a further price target.  In  New York , crude futures are “locked” in a range from
$101.80 and $105.07 a barrel, according to Barclays. A drop
below $101.80 would indicate that prices will decline further
toward $100.65, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
