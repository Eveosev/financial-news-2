Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and
PetroChina Co. are designing a liquefied natural gas plant in
 Australia  with capacity of about 9 million metric tons a year
that Deutsche Bank AG says will cost more than $20 billion.  Arrow Energy Ltd., the partners’ Brisbane-based venture,
plans to decide on whether to invest in the project by the end
of next year, Shell Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said.  “There have been and are ongoing discussions between
partners as to whether gas can potentially be taken from one
producer through other peoples’ facilities,” Henry said today
on a conference call. “If there’s a deal there to be done,
we’ll do the deal, if not then we move on” with building the
joint venture’s own LNG plant in Queensland, he said.  Arrow, acquired by Shell and PetroChina in 2010, bought Bow
Energy Ltd. last year for A$535 million ($555 million), gaining
resources to support the proposed development. Shareholders of
Arrow have agreed to buy all the LNG from the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
