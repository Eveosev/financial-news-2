The  European Space Agency  will
decide next week whether to launch an 830 million-euro ($1.1
billion) mission to explore habitable worlds around Jupiter.  A successful mission would enable scientists to learn more
about Jupiter’s habitable moons, according to Imperial College
of London space physicist Michele Dougherty, who spoke today at
a European Geosciences Union press briefing in Vienna. The
Paris-based agency is scheduled to decide on May 2.  The Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer, or “Juice” mission, would
be “the first to send an orbiter to an icy world,” said
Dougherty, who also leads the ESA’s mission-study team. “Juice
will address the question whether there are habitats elsewhere
in the solar system with the conditions to sustain life.”  The European satellite would orbit Jupiter’s Ganymede, the
gaseous planet’s largest moon, for about three years beginning
in 2030. Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system with its
own magnetic field, along with an atmosphere and subsurface
ocean. The Juice rocket would lift off in 2022 for the eight-
year journey to Jupiter.  Europe’s space agency is in talks with the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration about sharing instruments
on the Juice mission. A single instrument can cost 30 million
euros and the array of measurement and tracking devices that
would be loaded onto the orbiter aren’t included in the headline
cost, Dougherty said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
