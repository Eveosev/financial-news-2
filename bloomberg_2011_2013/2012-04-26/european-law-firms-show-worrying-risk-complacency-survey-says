More than 40 percent of European
law firms don’t know whether they have suffered a data breach in
the last three years, a data management company said today in
announcing the results of a risk survey.  Law firms’ responses to questions on data breaches, data-
loss and non-compliance showed a complacency on information
protection that made them the worst-performing industry in the
report, according to  Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM)   “If you are looking at data protection, law firms are way
behind, absolutely no doubt,” said Frank Maher, a lawyer at
Liverpool-based Legal Risk LLP. “A few of the largest firms are
just about getting it right but the vast majority barely even
get to base camp on compliance.”  Law firms averaged just 33.3 points from their survey
responses out of an ideal score of 100. The financial services
sector ranked highest with 46.3, compared to a European company-
average of 40. The  report , done with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
and released in March, questioned 600 businesses across Europe
including insurance, financial services and pharmaceutical
companies.  Just under 30 percent of law firms who responded said they
don’t have any training programs in place to teach employees
about risk.  “Our information risk study reveals a worrying level of
complacency across the legal sector in  Europe ,” said Christian
Toon, head of information security at Iron Mountain Europe.
“There’s absolutely no point in pouring resources into
information security if no one takes any notice.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
