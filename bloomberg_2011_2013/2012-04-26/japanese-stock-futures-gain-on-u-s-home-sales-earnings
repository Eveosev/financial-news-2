Japanese  shares  climbed after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he’s prepared to
do more to stimulate U.S. growth if needed. Gains were limited
after ruling party powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa was found not guilty
of violating campaign finance laws, raising concern gridlock may
make it difficult to pass new consumption taxes.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets almost 45 percent of
its sales in  North America , added 0.9 percent. Fujitsu General
Ltd. soared 11 percent after the air-conditioner company beat
earnings estimates.  Fanuc Corp. (6954)  sank 6.1 percent after the
factory-robotics manufacturer forecast lower operating profit.  The Topix Index rose 0.1 percent to 810.10 at the 3 p.m.
close, with about three shares advancing for every two that
declined. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  was little changed at
9,561.83 after swinging between gains of 0.7 percent and losses
of 0.3 percent. Volume on the gauge was more than a fifth below
the 30-day average before a Bank of  Japan  meeting tomorrow when
additional monetary easing is expected to be announced.  “Keeping  interest rates  low over the long term is good for
the market. The Fed made it clear that they’re going to do
that,” said  Toshio Sumitani , a strategist at Tokai Tokyo
Research Center. “The market is solid because earnings are
looking good.”  Gains were limited after Ozawa, 69, was cleared of charges
that he helped falsify reports from his political fundraising
organization about a 400 million-yen ($4.9 million) land
purchase,  Tokyo  District Court spokeswoman Aya Hatakeyama said.  ‘More Chaos’  “Foreign investors are looking at the verdict on Ozawa and
thinking, ‘this will mean more chaos in government and less
progress in the debate on taxes,’” said Yoshihiro Ito, chief
strategist at Okasan Online Securities Co.  The acquittal may further endanger Prime Minister Yoshihiko
Noda’s bill to double the 5 percent sales tax by 2015 to rein in
the world’s largest debt over the objections of opposition
lawmakers. Ozawa heads the largest faction within the Democratic
Party of Japan and has criticized the tax proposal as burdening
the public at a time when the economy is struggling.  “Politics surrounding the bill remain murky, but this
would appear to weaken the probability of passage in May-June,”
Barclays Capital said in a report dated today.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added 0.1
percent today. The gauge gained 1.4 percent in New York
yesterday after Bernanke said the Fed stands ready to add
stimulus if necessary even after leaving its policy unchanged
and upgrading its view of the  U.S. economy  for this year.  Honda gained 0.9 percent to 2,896 yen.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an
electronics maker that gets almost a fifth of sales in the U.S.,
climbed 0.7 percent to 7,560 yen.  U.S. Growth Outlook  Policy makers in the U.S. said they expect growth to
gradually accelerate, while refraining from new action to lower
borrowing costs. Central bankers upgraded their forecasts for
economic growth and unemployment while repeating their view that
borrowing costs are likely to remain “exceptionally low” at
least through late 2014.  In Japan, almost a fifth of the Topix’s 1,665 companies are
scheduled to report earnings this week. Net income grew more
than a fifth in the first quarter at 176 companies that reported
results since April 10, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Fujitsu General (6755)  soared 11 percent to 666 yen, its biggest
gain since March 2011, after posting net income of 5.17 billion
yen ($64 million) on rising overseas sales in the year ended
March 31. The air-conditioner maker forecast profit will grow 64
percent this fiscal year.  KDDI Corp., Japan’s second-largest mobile-phone operator,
advanced 1.5 percent to 532,000 yen after forecasting profit
will rise to 250 billion yen this fiscal year. The company also
announced a 100-for-1 stock split.  Fanuc Drops  Fanuc declined the  most  on the Nikkei 225, plunging 6.1
percent to 13,900 yen after saying it expects a 3.1 percent drop
in operating profit to 113 billion yen for the six months ending
September.  “People may think the stock has peaked out,” Tokai Tokyo
Research’s Sumitani said.  Komatsu slid 1.5 percent to 2,339 yen after  Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT) , the world’s largest maker of construction equipment,
reported a gain in first-quarter revenue that missed estimates
after sales fell in  China  and Brazil.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto in Tokyo. Editors: Jim
