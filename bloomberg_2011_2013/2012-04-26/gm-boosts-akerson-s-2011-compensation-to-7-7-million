General Motors Co. (GM)  increased Chief
Executive Officer Dan Akerson’s compensation to $7.7 million for
2011 when he led the company to record profit and GM regained
its position as the world’s top-selling automaker.  The automaker also said it’s nominating two new directors,
including the outgoing head of  ConocoPhillips (COP) , for election at
its June 12 annual meeting in Detroit.  Akerson, whose pay is subject to government review because
of GM’s 2009 U.S. bailout, received $1.7 million in salary and
$6 million in stock awards and other compensation, the Detroit-
based automaker said today in a regulatory filing. He made $2.53
million in 2010 when he replaced Ed Whitacre as CEO and led GM
the last four months of that year.  The U.S. Treasury Department said April 6 that Akerson’s
compensation in 2012 would be frozen at the 2011 level.  Akerson’s compensation is a fraction of Ford Chief
Executive Officer Alan Mulally’s $29.5 million package last year
and the 17.5 million euros ($23.1 million) that  Volkswagen AG (VOW) 
CEO Martin Winterkorn received.  GM earned $9.19 billion last year, the largest annual
profit in its 103-year-history. The automaker, which lost its
global sales crown in 2008 to  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , saw deliveries
rise 7.6 percent last year to 9.03 million to outsell its
Japanese competitor.  Director Nominees  GM said it’s nominating ConocoPhillips Chief Executive
Officer  Jim Mulva  and Tim Solso, retired CEO of  Cummins Inc. (CMI) ,
for board seats. Mulva departs ConocoPhillips on May 1. The
election of Mulva and Solso, both 65, would increase the board
to 14 members, including 12 outside directors. Akerson and Vice
Chairman Steve Girsky are the two employee directors.  The two are joining the board as Akerson faces challenges
in  Europe , where GM lost $747 million last year before interest
and taxes and losses have totaled $15.6 billion since 1999.  GM’s full-year profit in 2010 of $6.17 billion had been the
automaker’s largest annual income since its predecessor earned
$6.7 billion in 1997, excluding profit in 2009 to account for
its post-bankruptcy recapitalization.  Girsky received compensation of $5.31 million in 2011,
including $600,000 in salary.  GM rose 1.8 percent to $23.72 at the close in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
