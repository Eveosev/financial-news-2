Ontario’s credit rating was
downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service as stalling economic
growth puts its debt-reduction targets out of reach.  The rating was reduced to Aa2 from Aa1 and the outlook
revised to stable from negative. The downgrade brings Moody’s
assessment closer to  Standard & Poor’s , which previously rated
Ontario two steps lower.  “There are significant risks surrounding the province’s
ability to achieve their medium-term fiscal targets and
stabilize and then reverse the recent accumulation in debt,”
Moody’s analyst Jennifer Wong said in a report.  Canada’s most populous province is struggling to contain a
C$15.3 billion ($15.5 billion) budget shortfall by freezing
public-sector wages and levying a 2 percent surtax on wage-
earners of C$500,000 or more. Debt of C$257.5 billion is
expected to peak at a record 42 percent of gross domestic
product by 2015, according to Ontario’s budget released March
27. The ratio was 27 percent of GDP in 2007-08.  “Expense targets appear particularly ambitious” in light
of the “subdued growth outlook,” Moody’s said. Health-care
needs may swell with demographic pressures building on the
province’s biggest expense item, according to the report.  The downgrade comes after Ontario’s outlook by S&P worsened
yesterday. S&P put a negative outlook on its assessment, citing
“challenging cost-containment targets in the next one-to-two
years.” S&P rates the province at AA-, now a level lower than
Moody’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
