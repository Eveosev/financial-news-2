Tenaris SA (TEN) , the world’s largest
maker of seamless steel pipes, said first-quarter profit rose 39
percent, beating analyst estimates, on rising demand in  North
America .  Net income was $443.8 million, or 75 cents per American
depositary receipt, from $319.4 million, or 54 cents per ADR, a
year earlier, Luxembourg-based Tenaris said today in a
Marketwire statement. The company was expected to post profit of
$403 million, excluding some items, the average of five
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Increased oil drilling in North America, Tenaris’s biggest
market, and in other regions boosted demand for the company’s
products. The average number of active U.S. oil and gas rigs
rose 22 percent to 1,972 on April 20 from a year earlier,
according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   “The increase in rig count” supports a volume increase
Paula Kovarsky, an analyst at Banco Itau SA in Sao Paolo, said
in an April 24 note to clients. Global demand for rigs was
“fully supported by a 3 percent increase in the U.S.”, she
said.  Sales climbed 13 percent to $2.62 billion. Sales in North
America gained 32 percent to $1.29 billion. In  South America  and
Europe sales rose 2 percent to $323.2 million and 8 percent to
$263.1 million, respectively.  (Tenaris is scheduled to hold a conference call to discuss
the results at 10 a.m. New York time.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
