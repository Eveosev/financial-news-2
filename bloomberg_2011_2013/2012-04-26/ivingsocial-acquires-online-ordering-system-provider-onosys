LivingSocial.com, the second-
biggest provider of online daily deals, said it acquired Onosys,
a maker of ordering software, as it seeks to offer more services
to companies.  The  Onosys  team will join the merchant solutions group at
LivingSocial, which is run by Dickson Chu, according to Brendan
Lewis, a spokesman. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  LivingSocial is expanding beyond the daily-deals market,
where it goes head-to-head with market leader  Groupon Inc. (GRPN) 
Onosys, based in Cleveland, specializes in technology that helps
restaurants receive orders over the Web and mobile phones. Its
clients include  Papa John’s International Inc. (PZZA) ,  Panera Bread Co. (PNRA) 
and  Applebee’s International Inc.   Following Groupon’s initial public offering last year,
Washington-based LivingSocial lined up $400 million in funding
to give it a valuation of about $6 billion, a person familiar
with the matter said in December. The company was in talks last
year about raising $1 billion in an IPO before tapping the
private markets instead.  The deal provider lost more than $500 million last year,
Amazon.com Inc. said in a regulatory filing in February. Amazon
is a backer of LivingSocial.  To contact the reporters on this story:
