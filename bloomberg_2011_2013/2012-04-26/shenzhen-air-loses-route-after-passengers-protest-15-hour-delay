Shenzhen Airlines Co. said one of
its services was suspended by China’s aviation regulator after
passengers stranded for at least 15 hours by a delay protested
on an airport taxiway.  The  Air China Ltd. (753)  unit will stop flights to Harbin,
northern China, via Nanjing, on April 29 because of the incident,
a company spokeswoman said by phone today. She declined to be
named citing company policy. Calls to the  Civil Aviation
Authority  of China went unanswered.  About 30 passengers flying on an April 10 service pushed
their way past security guards and entered the tarmac at
Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport after being marooned
there overnight following a diversion. The protest, and a
similar incident in Guangzhou two days later, highlighted delays
in China, where about one in four flights is late.  Guangzhou police also yesterday detained one of the people
who took part in the protest at the southern Chinese city’s
airport. The person will be held for seven days while the
incident is investigated, according to a statement.  --Jasmine Wang. Editors: Neil Denslow,  Garry Smith   To contact the reporter on this story:
