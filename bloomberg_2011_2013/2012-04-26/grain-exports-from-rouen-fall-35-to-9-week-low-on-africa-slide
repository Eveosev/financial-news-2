Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 35 percent
to a nine-week low as no wheat was sent to African destinations
for the first time since January.  Export cargoes dropped to 37,585 metric tons between April
19 and April 25 from 57,771 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River
port  wrote in an e-mailed report today. That included 16,145
tons of soft wheat, down from 53,575 tons.  Algeria was the biggest destination, taking 13,500 tons of
barley, the port wrote. Shipments of the grain from Rouen
exceeded cargoes of wheat for the first time since at least
August 2010.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the  North Sea , which shipped out 17 percent and 11
percent respectively, according to port data.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
