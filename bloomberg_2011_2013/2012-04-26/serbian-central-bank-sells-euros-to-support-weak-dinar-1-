The Serbian central bank sold euros
for the fourth consecutive day to support the weakening dinar to
stem its declines ahead of May 6 elections.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 40 million
euros ($52.9 million) today to “ensure smooth functioning” of
the market, it said in a statement on its website.  The bank started selling euros this morning after the dinar
weakened through 112 to the euro, said three traders with
knowledge of the action, asking for anonymity because of banking
policies.  The central bank has spent a total of 678.5 million euros
since the start of 2012 to prop up the dinar, which has fallen
10.15 percent against the euro compared with the same period
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
