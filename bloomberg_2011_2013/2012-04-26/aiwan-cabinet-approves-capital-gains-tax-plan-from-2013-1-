 Taiwan’s Cabinet approved a
proposal by the  finance ministry  to levy a capital-gains tax on
securities transactions from next year.  Taiwan will levy a 15 percent to 20 percent tax on
individual investors who earn more than NT$4 million annually
from stock trades, the Cabinet said in a statement today.
Individuals won’t be taxed on gains made from futures trade, the
statement said.  Investors holding stocks for 3 years and more will be taxed
based on 50 percent of their gains, Finance Minister Christina
Liu said at a briefing in Taipei today. Local institutional
investors who earn in excess of NT$500,000 will face a 12
percent to 15 percent tax, while overseas investors without
offices and direct business operations in  Taiwan  will be exempt,
she said.  The government will retain an existing securities
transaction tax of 0.3 percent, Kuan chung-ming, Minister
without Portfolio said. The plan will be submitted to
Legislature for approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
