Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
lender by customers, said first-quarter profit increased by 13
percent to 2.64 billion shillings ($31.7 million) as loans
surged.  Net interest income, the money banks earn from interest
charges on loans, jumped 58 percent to 5.69 billion shillings in
the three months through March, Managing Director James Mwangi
told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital.  “The growth in the loan book and adjustment in  interest
rates  helped to increase net interest income,” Faith Atiti, an
analyst at Nairobi-based Sterling Investment Bank Ltd., said in
an interview.  Equity raised its effective lending rate to 25 percent in
November from 19 percent previously after the central bank
increased Kenya’s  benchmark rate  to rein in surging inflation.  The bank had 7.5 million customers at the end of the first
quarter, compared with 6.2 million a year earlier, he said.  “We are hoping in the not too distant future Equity will
be banking 20 million customers,” Mwangi said.  Outlets in the quarter rose to 186 from 163 a year earlier,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
