Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  gained 1.2 percent to 60,677.81 at the close in Istanbul,
increasing for a second day as Fitch Ratings said Turkey’s
fundamentals give it potential for an upgrade to investment
grade.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Aygaz AS (AYGAZ)  , a liquefied gas company, fell 1
percent to 8.20 liras after Turkey’s asset sales agency said it
will cancel the auction of the Ankara gas grid, for which Aygaz
was among the bidders, because bidders failed to meet the
government’s price requirement of $626 million.  Bizim Toptan Satis Magazalari AS (BIZIM)  , a Turkish
chain of wholesale stores, jumped 5.6 percent to 26.30 liras,
adding the most in almost 15 months, after saying first-quarter
revenue rose 18 percent to 429.2 million liras ($242.9 million).
Volume of shares traded today at 425,775 was 245 percent of the
stock’s three-month average.  Fenerbahce Sportif Hizmetler Sanayi & Ticaret AS (FENER)  , the merchandising arm for Istanbul’s Fenerbahce soccer
club, surged 13 percent to 59.50 liras, the highest level since
July, after Vatan newspaper reported an ethics commission found
no evidence the soccer club’s jailed president Aziz Yildirim was
involved in a bribery scandal. The volume of shares traded was
2.55 million, more than quadruple the stock’s three-month
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
