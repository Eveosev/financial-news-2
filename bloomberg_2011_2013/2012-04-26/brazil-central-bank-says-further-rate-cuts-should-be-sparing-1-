Brazil ’s central bank signaled
today that it could continue cutting its benchmark lending rate
to historic lows as the economy recovers more slowly than
expected. Interest-rate futures yields dropped to a record low.  In the minutes to its April 17-18 meeting, the bank said
that given the delayed effects of rate cuts carried out so far,
any further reductions should be “conducted with parsimony.”  The bank’s board, led by President Alexandre Tombini, voted
unanimously last week to cut the Selic rate by 75 basis points
to 9 percent, saying a still “fragile” global economy is
easing inflationary pressures. The bank has lowered the Selic by
350 basis points since August to just above the historic low of
8.75 percent in an attempt to bolster economic growth and shield
the second-largest emerging market from the European debt
crisis.  “If the situation remains as is, the bank will cut again
by 25 basis points and hold for quite a while,” Jose Goncalves,
chief economist at Banco Fator SA, said by telephone from  Sao
Paulo . “There are various indicators of slowness; disappointing
surprises with the pace of growth.”  Low-Cost Loans  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government has cut taxes on
consumer and industrial goods and boosted low-cost loans to the
state development bank, BNDES, even as the pace of inflation has
remained above target for a year and a half. Brazil’s growth
dropped to 2.7 percent last year from 7.5 percent in 2010, its
second-weakest performance since 2003.  The yield on the futures contract due in January 2014 slid
for a third day, dropping eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 8.75 percent at 9:55 a.m. in Sao Paulo, as traders
boosted bets on rate cuts. It earlier touched a record low of
8.74 percent. The real depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.8869 per
dollar.  The central bank sent “a clear signal of a bias toward
another cut of the Selic,” said  Luciano Rostagno , chief
strategist at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA, in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo. “An increase in the  unemployment
rate , slightly above expectations, is increasing the chances of
a 50 basis-point cut.”  Brazil’s jobless rate rose to 6.2 percent in March from 5.7
percent the previous month, the national statistics agency said
today. The number was higher than any estimate from 36
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median forecast was for
a 6 percent rate.  Tombini Surprises  No central banker in the world’s top 10 economies has
surprised analysts as frequently as Tombini. Since taking office
15 months ago, he set  interest rates  lower than economists
expected in three out of 10 policy meetings, including an August
reduction that all 62 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg failed to
anticipate.  Russia ’s central bank, the second most
unpredictable, defied economists in three out of 14 rate
decisions in the same period.  While the government has pledged growth of 4 percent to 4.5
percent this year, economists in the latest weekly central bank
survey predicted expansion of 3.21 percent in 2012 and 4.25
percent in 2013.  The economic slowdown has helped ease the pace of price
increases. Annual inflation as measured by the IPCA-15 index
slowed to 5.25 percent in mid-April, the lowest rate since
October 2010. Prices rose 6.5 percent last year.  Economists cut their forecast for 2012 consumer prices to
5.08 percent in the central bank survey, from 5.32 percent at
the start of the year, as inflation slowed in line with the
central bank’s predictions. Rostagno said economists will
increase their 2013 inflation forecasts after today’s minutes.
The bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
