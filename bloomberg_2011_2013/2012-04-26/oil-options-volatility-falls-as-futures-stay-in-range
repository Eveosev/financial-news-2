Oil options volatility declined to
the lowest level in more than a year as the underlying futures
rose while remaining within a three-week trading range.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 21.7 percent at 3:50 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , compared with 23.1 percent yesterday. It
was the sixth straight decline and lowest level since at least
March 4, 2011.  Crude oil for June delivery rose 43 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to settle at $104.55 a barrel on Nymex, a three-week high.
Crude, which has gained 5.8 percent this year, has traded in a
range of $100.68 to $105.07 since April 4.  Prices climbed today as  pending home purchases  rose and the
dollar weakened, increasing the investment appeal of
commodities.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were June $110 calls, which fell 4 cents to 45 cents a barrel at
3:46 p.m. with 2,620 contracts trading. June $90 puts were the
second-most active with 2,053 lots changing hands. They lost 2
cents to 6 cents.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish bets accounted for 56 percent of the 127,789 trades
in the previous session. June $100 puts were the most actively
traded, with 5,831 lots changing hands. They were down 23 cents
to 97 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, June $85
puts, fell 1 cent to 3 cents on volume of 5,216.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 44,016
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 38,060 lots and
June $140 calls with 35,022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
