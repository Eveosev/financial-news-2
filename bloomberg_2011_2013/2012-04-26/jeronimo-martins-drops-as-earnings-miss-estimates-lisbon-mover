Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT) ,
Portugal’s biggest retailer, fell the most in seven months after
reporting earnings that missed analysts’ estimates and
predicting a “tough year” for the domestic economy.  Jeronimo Martins   dropped  5.1 percent to 14.06 euros, the
biggest one-day decline since Sept. 22 and the lowest close
since March 8.  The hypermarket operator anticipates “a very tough year”
for the Portuguese economy in 2012, Chief Executive Officer
Pedro Soares dos Santos said today in a statement. First-quarter
net income rose 21 percent to 68 million euros ($90 million),
falling short of the 71.6 million-euro average of seven analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings growth was helped by growth at the company’s
Biedronka supermarket chain in  Poland , while the Pingo Doce
division in Portugal “has decided to reinforce its price
positioning to strengthen its competitiveness,” Jeronimo
Martins said. That investment may affect Pingo Doce’s earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as a
proportion of sales, the retailer said.  “Jeronimo Martins continues to deliver in Poland, but
Portugal was weaker than expected,” Jose Rito and Bruno Bessa,
analysts at  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  with an “accumulate”  recommendation 
on the stock, said today in a research report. The company
missed expectations for sales and Ebitda, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
