Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , the
commodities trader seeking to acquire  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , signed $12.8
billion of revolving credit facilities to refinance and extend
existing lines, an increase of about 28 percent on what it
originally sought.  Glencore obtained a $4.4 billion 14-month  credit line ,
which includes a 10-month extension option, to replace a $3.5
billion, 364-day loan due to mature in May, according to a
statement from the Baar, Switzerland-based company. The facility
is split between $3.7 billion and $710 million portions, it
said. Glencore will pay interest at 125 basis points more than
the London interbank offered rate for the loan, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the deal.  The largest publicly-traded commodity supplier also
extended for one year $8 billion of an existing $8.37 billion
revolving credit that was due to mature in May 2014, the company
said. It will pay interest at 175 basis points more than Libor
for the extension, the person said, who declined to be
identified as the terms are private.  The loans were increased from the $10 billion targeted as
the deal was “substantially oversubscribed” in syndication,
Glencore said. ABN Amro Bank NV, Citigroup Inc., Lloyds Banking
Group, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, and Standard Chartered
Plc coordinated the refinancing, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, which was provided by a syndicate of 91 banks, the
company said.  Participation Fee  The arrangers offered other lenders a participation fee
ranging from 45 to 50 basis points depending on the amount
committed, the person said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. In a revolving credit, money can be borrowed again once
it’s repaid.  Glencore also said it signed a $3.1 billion loan backing
the proposed merger with Xstrata, scaling back from the $6
billion originally sought, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It received commitments for about $11 billion in
syndication from 31 banks, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
