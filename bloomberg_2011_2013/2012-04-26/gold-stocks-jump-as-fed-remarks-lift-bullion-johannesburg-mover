The gold mining index in  South
Africa  rose the most in three months on speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve may increase stimulus after unemployment benefit
claims in the country unexpectedly grew last week.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index (JGOLD)  jumped 3.5 percent,
the most since Jan. 26, to 2,287.26 by the close in
Johannesburg.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Africa ’s biggest producer
of the metal, surged 3.7 percent.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the world’s
fourth-biggest gold producer, added 3.4 percent. Gold gained as
the dollar weakened against the euro.  “Gold stocks are poised to do well” provided the gold
price stays at these levels, Deryck Janse van Rensburg, a
Johannesburg-based portfolio manager at BOE Stockbrokers, said
by phone.  Jobless  claims  fell by 1,000 to 388,000 in the week ended
April 21, from a revised 389,000 a week earlier, which was the
highest since early January, Labor Department figures showed
today. The median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 375,000. Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said yesterday the central bank will do more to fuel
growth if necessary, resulting in dollar weakness and bullion
strength. Bullion and the U.S. currency tend to move inversely.  Gold shares including AngloGold also recovered from an
oversold position, Janse van Rensburg said. AngloGold’s 14-day
 relative strength index  declined to 22.7 on April 24. A reading
of 30 or below signals to some technical analysts a security is
undervalued and poised for a rebound.  “After the recent sell-off, it was anticipated there would
be a bit of a bounce,” he said.  The dollar depreciated against the euro for a third day,
down 0.1 percent to 1.3234, heading for the weakest in more than
three weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
