Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3) ’s first
quarter earnings missed analysts’ estimates as the company’s
higher investments in marketing outweighed faster sales growth.  Net income rose 0.7 percent to 151.5 million reais ($80.6
million) from 150.5 million reais a year earlier, the Cajamar-
based company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The result
was below the 159.3 million reais average estimate for profit
excluding some items of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Latin America ’s largest cosmetics company’s costs went up
to 38 percent of its net revenue, 140 basis points higher than
in the same quarter last year, due especially to higher
marketing investment in Natura’s international operations, the
company said in the statement.  Natura’s international operations are now responsible for
11 percent of the company’s net revenue, compared to 8.1 percent
in the first quarter of 2011.  “In  Brazil , we kept our strategy of optimizing our
marketing investments and seeking efficiency in logistics
processes,” according to the filing.  “Natura seems to have turned the page in terms of ongoing
logistics and information technology systems problems, although
some vestiges should negatively impact its results for the
quarter,” Bradesco BBI analysts Ricardo Boiati, Alan Cardoso
and Pedro Bueno wrote in a note to clients dated April 23.  Natura net sales rose 11 percent to 1.28 billion reais,
from 1.15 billion reais a year earlier. The company sales went
back to a double digit percentage growth after slowing down to
an average 9 percent in 2011, less than half of the 21-percent
expansion in 2010. The number of direct sellers grew 17 percent
to 1.43 million.  Natura rose 3 percent, to close at 45.25 reais in São Paulo
yesterday. The stock is up 25 percent since the beginning of the
year, compared to an 8.8 percent gain for the  Bovespa (IBOV)  benchmark
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
