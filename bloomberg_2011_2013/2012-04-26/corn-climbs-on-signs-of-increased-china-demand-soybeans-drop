Corn rose for the first time in
three days on signs of increased Chinese demand for U.S.
supplies. Wheat also gained while soybeans dropped.  U.S. exporters sold 682,500 metric tons of corn, including
262,500 tons to  China  and 420,000 tons for unknown destinations,
the Department of Agriculture said yesterday. The sale was the
third in as many days, bringing total purchases this week to
1.28 million tons. U.S. exporters sold 826,213 tons of corn the
week ended April 19, nearly triple the amount sold a week
earlier, the USDA said today.  “Support is coming from confirmation of the sales that
came through yesterday from China,” Christopher Gadd, an
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., said by phone from London.  Corn for July delivery rose 0.6 percent to $6.0475 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:14 p.m. in London. Futures
fell 1.9 percent in the previous two days after the U.S.
reported the first case of mad-cow disease in six years, raising
speculation that feed use may drop.  China may have purchased 2 million tons of new-crop U.S.
 corn  since last Thursday that will be delivered in the 2012-2013
marketing year, state-owned researcher Grain.gov.cn said today,
without saying where it got the information.  Soybeans for July delivery dropped 0.1 percent to $14.745 a
bushel in  Chicago . Yesterday, the price touched $14.9675, the
highest since July 18, 2008. Exporters sold 165,000 tons of
soybeans to unknown buyers on April 23, according to the USDA.  Soybeans rallied “on the back of aggressive buying from
China and reduced crop prospects from  South America ,” which has
suffered from drought and freeze this year, INTL FCStone risk
management consultants Rory Deverell and Jaime Miralles said in
a report.  Wheat for July delivery rose 0.6 percent to $6.30 a bushel
in Chicago. In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat increased
0.5 percent to 201 euros ($265.62) a ton.  To contact the reporter for this story:
