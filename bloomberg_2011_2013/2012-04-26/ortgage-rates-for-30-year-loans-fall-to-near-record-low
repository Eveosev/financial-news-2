Mortgage rates  in the U.S. for 30-
year fixed loans fell for the fourth time in five weeks,
decreasing borrowing costs as the housing market reaches bottom.  The average rate for a 30-year mortgage fell to 3.88
percent in the week ended today from 3.9 percent,  Freddie Mac (FMCC) 
said in a statement. It hit 3.87 percent in February, the lowest
in the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company’s records
dating to 1971. The average 15-year rate dropped to 3.12 percent
from 3.13 percent.  While the U.S.  home  market is showing signs of improvement,
tight credit and an  unemployment rate  above 8 percent are
holding back demand. Home values in more than half of major U.S.
markets will probably reach a bottom by the end of the year,
Seattle-based data provider  Zillow Inc. (Z)  said yesterday.  “Great affordability helps,”  David Goldberg , an analyst
with  UBS AG (UBSN)  in New York, said in a telephone interview
yesterday. “But the availability of credit is what will dictate
the pace of improvement.”  Contracts to buy previously owned homes climbed 4.1 percent
last month from February to the highest level in two years, the
National Association of Realtors said today.  Home prices in 20 U.S. cities fell 3.5 percent in February,
the smallest 12-month decline since February 2011, the S&P/Case-
Shiller index showed on April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
