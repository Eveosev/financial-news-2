Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s “Marvel’s The
Avengers” broke opening-day records in four overseas markets,
an indication the studio has a hit.  The super-hero film featuring Robert Downey Jr. and
Scarlett Johannson opened in 10 markets yesterday. It had record
first-day grosses in New Zealand and Taiwan, and set new marks
for a Disney release in Australia and Italy, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. “The
Avengers” took in a total of $17.1 million internationally,
Disney said. The movie opens May 4 in the U.S.  Disney would welcome a hit after announcing last month that
it will take a $200 million write-down on the March science
fiction release “ John Carter .” Film studio Chairman  Rich Ross 
resigned on April 20. A successor wasn’t named. The studio
expects to post a quarterly loss of as much as $120 million as a
result of the flop.  Foreign markets represent a growing share of ticket sales
for U.S. studios, according to the Washington-based  Motion
Picture Association  of America. Worldwide box office sales rose
3.2 percent to $32.6 billion last year, while the U.S. and
Canadian portion fell 3.8 percent to $10.2 billion, the trade
group said last month.  Movietickets.com, which sells tickets in advance for U.S.
theaters, said it is selling more admissions to “The Avengers”
than all previous releases from Disney’s Marvel unit, including
“Iron Man 2.” That film grossed $623 million worldwide in
2010, according to Box Office Mojo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
