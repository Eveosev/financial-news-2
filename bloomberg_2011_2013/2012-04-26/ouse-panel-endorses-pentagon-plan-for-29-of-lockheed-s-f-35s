A House Armed Services Committee
panel endorsed without cuts Pentagon plans to fund 29  Lockheed
Martin Corp. (LMT)  F-35 fighters, it said today.  The Pentagon in its fiscal 2013 budget requested $9.1
billion for the fighters, including $6.1 billion in procurement
spending.  The House committee’s airland panel endorsed the 29. Its
recommendation must be approved by the entire committee next
week in its review of the spending plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
