Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s second-largest
mining company, is “very concerned” about its $5.9 billion
potash project in Argentina, where the government last week
seized control of oil producer  YPF SA. (YPFD)   Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro, will present a review of its
Rio Colorado potash project in the Argentine province of Mendoza
to its board next month, Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira
said in a conference call with analysts today.  “We are very concerned about the political situation and
their whole environment in Argentina,” Ferreira said. “We are
doing a big analysis of the situation outside of the project.”  Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
announced the government takeover on April 16 of the Argentine
 oil company  that was majority owned by Spain’s  Repsol YPF SA. (REP) 
The decision will deter international investment in the South
American nation, according to analysts such as Felipe Hernandez
at RBS Securities Inc.  Vale has already spent $1.1 billion on Rio Colorado, which
will be able to produce 4.3 million metric tons of potash, a
mineral used to help strengthen plant roots and defend against
drought. The company may surpass its investment target for this
year as it accelerates development of mining projects, Vale
Chief Financial Officer Tito Martins said today.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  is the world’s largest mining company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
