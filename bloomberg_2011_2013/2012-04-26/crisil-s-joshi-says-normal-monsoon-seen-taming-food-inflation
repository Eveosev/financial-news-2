Dharmakirti Joshi, Mumbai-based
chief economist at credit rating company  CRISIL Ltd. (CRISIL) , the Indian
unit of Standard & Poor’s, comments on the impact of a normal
monsoon on inflation, economic growth and interest rates.  Monsoon rainfall in India, the main source of irrigation
for the country’s 235 million farmers, will be normal this year,
the  India Meteorological Department  said in a statement in  New
Delhi  today. Rains will be 99 percent of the 50-year average of
89 centimeters in the June-September season, it said.  Joshi spoke in a phone interview from Mumbai.  “This is the first estimate and has to be taken with a
pinch of salt. Anyway, this is good news for inflation,
particularly from the food inflation point of view. If the
normal monsoon materializes, this will definitely help in taming
food inflation.  ‘‘This is a good sentiment booster. This is a first cut
good news for the economy because monsoon always remains a risk
for India from the inflation perspective.  ‘‘ Interest rates  will depend on many other factors. Not
monsoon alone. This is one positive factor from the interest
rate perspective. Unless the overall inflation comes under
control, I think that further easing will be restricted.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
