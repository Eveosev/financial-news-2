Home prices  in New York’s Hamptons,
the  Long Island  oceanside retreat for summering Manhattanites,
increased almost 12 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier as the most expensive properties attracted buyers.  The median price of homes that sold in the quarter climbed
to $780,000 from $699,000 a year earlier even as total sales
declined, according to a report today by New York appraiser
 Miller Samuel Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas Elliman  Real
Estate. The median for luxury homes in the Hamptons and Long
Island’s North Fork, defined as the top 10 percent of all sales,
increased 3.8 percent to $4.78 million.  The high-end market is showing stability as employment
improves and foreign investors seek beachside real estate as a
place to park cash, said  Jonathan Miller , president of Miller
Samuel.  New York City ’s financial industry had a net gain of
6,700 jobs in the 12 months through March, according to the
state  Department of Labor . The city’s jobless rate was 9.8
percent that month, down from 10.2 percent in February.  “The big boys are comfortable parting with money again,”
said Judi Desiderio, president of  Town & Country Real Estate ,
which released a report this month showing that the dollar value
of Hamptons homes that changed hands in the quarter jumped 30
percent to $394.4 million.  Sales of Hamptons and North Fork luxury properties, which
this quarter includes homes priced at $3.4 million or higher,
increased to 38 deals from 37 a year earlier, according to the
 Miller Samuel  and Prudential report. Total Hamptons home sales
fell 7.1 percent to 287 transactions.  ‘Steady Diet’  The median home price in the Hamptons fell to as low as
$675,000 in the first quarter of 2009, when demand plunged in
the aftermath of  Lehman Brothers  Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy. It
rose to a post-recession high of $937,000 in the second quarter
of 2011.  “Prices aren’t rising rapidly, we’re just seeing strength
at the upper end,” Miller said. “You have a steady diet of
high-end property being absorbed.”  The most expensive property to change hands in the first
quarter was a 9,000-square foot (836-square-meter), six-bedroom
oceanfront house at  322 Meadow Lane  in Southampton, which sold
for $28.5 million in February after almost 3 1/2 years on the
market, according to to Miller and Streeteasy.com, a property-
listing website. The final price was a 16 percent reduction from
what the owner last sought, according to Streeteasy.  Still Recovering  “Much like  Manhattan , prices aren’t what they were before
Lehman Brothers and that’s certainly true of the Hamptons,”
said Gregory Heym, chief economist for brokerage  Brown Harris
Stevens .  Brown Harris, which also released a report today, said the
median price of sold homes in the Hamptons climbed 5 percent to
$815,000. The  Corcoran Group , another New York brokerage with
offices in the Hamptons, reported that prices declined 5 percent
from a year earlier to $821,000.  Hamptons homes took 6 percent more time to sell in the
quarter than they did a year earlier, averaging 177 days on the
market, according to Miller Samuel and Prudential. Luxury homes
spent an average of 122 days on the market, 15 percent less time
than they did a year ago.  The towns of Montauk and Shelter Island saw the biggest
gains in prices, according to Corcoran. In Montauk, the median
price of sold homes jumped 38 percent to $945,000. Twenty-three
properties changed hands, compared with 24 a year earlier.  In Shelter Island, the median climbed 21 percent to
$652,000. There were 11 deals in the quarter, down from 15 a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
