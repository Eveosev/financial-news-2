Banco BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11) , the Brazilian
investment bank led by billionaire  Andre Esteves , has hired a
top executive from the Mexican stock exchange to lead the firm’s
operations in the country, a person familiar with the move said.  Javier Artigas, outgoing chief of strategic planning at
Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB, will become the country head for
Sao Paulo-based BTG Pactual as it expands in Latin America’s
second-biggest economy, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the details haven’t been made public.  Artigas is in charge of new listings at the exchange, where
he also helped create products including the country’s first
real estate investment trust. He previously led the Mexican
brokerage of Zurich-based  UBS AG. (UBSN)   He plans to leave his current post next month, the exchange
said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Roberto Gavaldon, a
spokesman for the exchange, declined to comment beyond the
statement. Artigas and a BTG official also declined to comment
on the move.  BTG Pactual was the first stand-alone investment bank to go
public in Brazil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
