The yen rose for the first time in
three days versus the euro and dollar, even before a meeting
tomorrow where the Bank of  Japan  may boost stimulus measures,
after the  Federal Reserve  said yesterday U.S. borrowing costs
will stay at virtually zero through 2014.  The euro remained lower against the yen as Standard &
Poor’s cut  Spain ’s sovereign debt rating to BBB+ from A. The
pound gained to its highest level since September versus the
greenback after U.K. consumer confidence climbed more than
economists estimated. The dollar remained weaker after Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the central bank is
ready to introduce more stimulus if the economy deteriorates.  “The expectation is that the BOJ will increase the asset
purchase program, and the scope for disappointment is helping
the yen stay strong,” said Brian Kim, a currency strategist in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut , at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.
“You also get the sense that people were expecting a more
hawkish Fed, and they didn’t get that.”  The yen gained 0.4 percent to 80.99 per dollar at 5 p.m.
New York time and touched 80.67, the strongest level since April
17. It appreciated 0.4 percent against the euro, to 107.07. The
U.S. currency was little changed at $1.3219 per euro after
reaching $1.3263 earlier, the weakest level since April 3.  S&P lowered its rating on Spanish  government bonds  by two
levels, saying the nation’s budget-deficit trajectory is likely
to worsen.  Japan’s currency rose against most of its 16 major
counterparts, and  Brazil ’s real and  Norway ’s krone were the
biggest losers. The real slid 0.3 percent to 1.8856 per dollar,
and the krone dropped 0.4 percent to 5.7404 to the greenback.  Stock Gains  The yen stayed higher versus the dollar even after an index
of pending U.S. home purchases rose more than forecast, pushing
stocks up. The National Association of Realtors’ gauge of the
sales increased 4.1 percent in March to the highest level since
April 2010. A Bloomberg News survey projected a 1 percent rise.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.7 percent.  Fed policy makers refrained yesterday from new actions to
stimulate the economy, while saying the housing sector remains
depressed and global financial strains present “significant
downside risk.” They repeated their view borrowing costs are
likely to remain “exceptionally low” at least through late
2014. The benchmark  interest rate  has been at zero to 0.25
percent since December 2008.  While they upgraded forecasts for growth this year to 2.4
percent to 2.9 percent, policy makers lowered projections for
growth in 2014 to 3.1 percent to 3.6 percent, below a January
estimate of 3.3 percent to 4 percent.  “Right now, equities are higher and the dollar is
weaker,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist at Gain
Capital Group LLC in New York. “That’s consistent with a market
that’s still expecting the Fed to do more.”  Prepared for More  Bernanke said yesterday after a two-day Fed policy meeting
that central bankers “remain prepared to do more” if economic
conditions worsen.  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annual
rate in the first quarter after advancing 3 percent in the
previous three months, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before a report tomorrow.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  is due to release new inflation forecasts
tomorrow and will probably announce an increase in asset
purchases ranging from 5 trillion yen ($62 billion) to 10
trillion yen, economists surveyed by Bloomberg said.  “Yen direction will remain mainly driven by safe-haven
demand linked to developments in the  euro zone ,” said  Lee Hardman , a foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London .  Confidence Flags  The euro fell against the yen after the European Commission
said in Brussels an index of executive and consumer  sentiment  in
the 17-nation currency area slid to 92.8 in April from a revised
94.5 in March. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for
a drop to 94.2 from a previously reported 94.4.  The  implied volatility  of three-month options for Group of
Seven currencies slid to 9.21 percent, the lowest level since
2007, according to the JPMorgan Volatility Index. The 10-year
average is 10.6 percent. Lower volatility makes investments in
currencies of nations with higher benchmark rates more
attractive because the risk in such trades is that market moves
will erase profits.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, was little changed at 79.008 after dropping to
78.823, the lowest level since April 3.  The greenback has slid 2.7 percent this year, the second-
worst performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The yen has
tumbled 8.1 percent, while the euro has declined 0.5 percent.  Pound Winning Streak  The pound climbed for a ninth day against the dollar, the
longest winning streak since January 2011, after a Nationwide
Building Society index of sentiment rose to 53 in March from 44
the previous month.  The U.K. currency gained 0.1 percent to $1.6186, after
touching $1.6207, the highest level since Sept. 2. It rose 0.1
percent to 81.69 pence per euro.  Sterling may strengthen to $1.6425 if it ends the day’s
trading above a key level of resistance, Commerzbank AG said,
citing trading patterns.  “Pound-dollar is starting to erode the $1.6167
resistance,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and
currency technical analysis in London, wrote in a note to
clients. “This is the October 2011 high and the 61.8 percent
retracement of the move seen 2011-2012,” she wrote, citing
Fibonacci analysis.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
new high or low. Resistance is an area on a chart where orders
to sell a security may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
