The Swedish krona strengthened for
the third straight day against the dollar after a report showed
 consumer confidence  climbed in April to a nine-month high.  The currency rose against seven of its most-traded peers.
The consumer confidence index increased to 4.7, the highest
level since July, from zero in March, the Stockholm-based
 National Institute of Economic Research  said today. Data two
days ago showed unemployment unexpectedly dropped in March. The
Swedish central bank has cut its key  interest rate  twice since
December and forecast more reductions are unlikely amid signs
that growth is being sustained.  “Recent economic data such as consumer confidence today
and unemployment suggest it’s unlikely that the central bank
will cut rates further any time soon,” said Jane Foley, a
senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in  London .
“That should be supportive for the krona, which in my view is
still undervalued against its peers.”  The krona appreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 6.6920 per
dollar, trading at 6.7148 at 4:41 p.m. London time. It was
little changed against the euro at 8.8871, after strengthening
to 8.8671.  Norway’s krone declined against the dollar and the euro as
a report showed the nation’s jobless rate remained unchanged at
2.6 percent this month. It was predicted to drop to 2.5 percent
in a survey of economists by Bloomberg.  The krone fell 0.2 percent to 5.7296 per dollar, and
dropped 0.3 percent versus the euro to 7.5829.  Swedish bonds rose, pushing 10-year yields three basis
points lower to 1.82 percent. Similar-maturity Norwegian yields
fell four basis points to 2.24 percent.  Swedish bonds earned 1 percent this month, outperforming
all AAA government securities in the euro region, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Norwegian debt handed investors a
0.6 percent return, matching that of  Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
