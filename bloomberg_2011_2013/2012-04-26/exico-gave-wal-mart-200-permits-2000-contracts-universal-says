Mexico ’s federal government granted
Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB 200 permits and 2,000 contracts over a
period of six years,  El Universal  reported.  In 2009, the government re-zoned “forested land” in Playa
del Carmen, a beach resort in the east of the country, to allow
Wal-Mart to build a supermarket, the Mexico City-based newspaper
said today on its website.  President Felipe Calderon said in Houston yesterday that he
was “very indignant” about allegations Wal-Mart bribed local
officials to speed its expansion in Mexico, El Universal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
