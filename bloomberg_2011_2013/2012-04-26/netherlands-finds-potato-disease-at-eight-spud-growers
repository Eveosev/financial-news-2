The Netherlands found potato ring
rot at eight growers in the south of the country, after  Germany 
last month reported the disease in spuds produced from Dutch
seed potatoes, the Dutch food-safety authority reported.  The bacterial rot was found at farms that bought seed
material from the Dutch grower that supplied infected potatoes
to Germany, the Nederlandse Voedsel- en Warenautoriteit wrote in
 statement  on its website today.  Ring rot is a serious potato illness because the disease
has the potential to spread quickly on a farm and can cause
severe losses if left unchecked,  according  to data from  Ohio
State University . Dutch potato growers must use certified seed
material, according to the food-safety authority.  “The consignments of potatoes have been tracked down and
will be pulled from the market,” the food-safety authority
wrote. “Ring rot is a contagious potato disease that is not
harmful to public health.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
