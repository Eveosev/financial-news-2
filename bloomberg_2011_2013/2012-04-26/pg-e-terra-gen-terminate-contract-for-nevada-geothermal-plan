PG&E Corp. (PCG) , the owner of
 California ’s largest utility, and Terra-Gen Power LLC canceled
an energy contract for a 53-megawatt geothermal power project
near Dixie Valley,  Nevada .  PG&E’s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. notified regulators of
the cancellation of the contract, without providing a reason, in
a letter filed today with the California Public Utilities
Commission. “Confidentiality obligations that still exist under
the contract preclude further comment,” PG&E said in an e-
mailed statement.  PG&E submitted the  contract  for regulatory approval in
September 2010, after agreeing to purchase for 25 years the
output from Terra-Gen’s Coyote Canyon plant starting in June
2013. The price was more than 11.25 cents a kilowatt-hour, the
2009 market rate referent for projects with a similar contract
term and coming online in 2013, PG&E said.  Terra-Gen, a renewable energy developer backed by ArcLight
Capital Partners LLC and Global Infrastructure Partners, isn’t
commenting on the cancellation, Gregory Wetstone, the company’s
vice president of government affairs, said by e-mail.  Coyota Canyon, which was to be located on public lands
administered by the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land
Management, was on the agency’s  list  of priority projects and
received federal approval in March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
