The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 8.5
basis points to 653.5, according to BNP Paribas SA. at 7:30 a.m.
in London. A decline signals improved perceptions of  credit
quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was down two at 139.5 basis points. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers declined four basis points to 243 and the
subordinated gauge was 7.5 lower at 404.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five

face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
