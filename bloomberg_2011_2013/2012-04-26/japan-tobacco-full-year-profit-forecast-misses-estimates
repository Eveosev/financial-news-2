Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) ,  Asia ’s largest
listed cigarette maker by market value, forecast this year’s
annual profit below analysts’ estimates.  Net income will probably be 318 billion yen for the year
ending in March 2013, the Tokyo-based company said in a
statement today. That was lower than the 341 billion yen average
of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales are
expected to reach 2.12 trillion yen, said the company.  Japan Tobacco is increasing dependent on the overseas
business as the company faces a shrinking domestic market. Its
domestic market share fell to  55 percent  in the year ended March
2012 from 64 percent a year ago because the earthquake triggered
reduction of tobacco shipment.  Japan  Tobacco will be more
dependent on overseas markets, President Hiroshi Kimura said on
April 23.  Japan’s only tobacco maker is aggressively expanding
overseas through acquisitions. The company bought Sudanese
tobacco maker  Haggar Cigarette & Tobacco Factory Ltd.  for about
$450 million in 2011. Its biggest acquisition so far is the
U.K.-based  Gallaher Group Plc  for about 9.4 billion pounds in
2007.　　  To contact the reporters on this story:
