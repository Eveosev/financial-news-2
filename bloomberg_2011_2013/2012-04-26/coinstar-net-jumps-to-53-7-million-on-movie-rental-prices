Coinstar Inc. (CSTR) , owner of the Redbox
movie-rental kiosks, declined in extended trading after its
full-year profit forecast fell below some analysts’ estimates.  Coinstar dropped as much as 4.9 percent and fell 2.9
percent to $65.52 in trading after the close in  New York  after
the company reiterated a 2012 profit prediction from continuing
operations of $4.40 a share to $4.80 a share. Analysts’
estimates averaged $4.77 a share, with three above $4.80 a
share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Coinstar expects some costs to increase during the second
half of the year as the company expands its kiosk businesses and
develops a joint venture to offer video streaming with Verizon
Communications Inc., Scott Di Valerio, chief financial officer,
said on a conference call. In the first quarter the company
benefited from higher prices for Redbox rentals and lower-than-
expected debit card processing fees.  First-quarter profit was $53.7 million, or $1.65 cents a
share, compared with $14.8 million, or 46 cents a share, a year
earlier, Bellevue, Washington-based Coinstar said today in a
statement. That compared with the range of $1.62 to $1.66 a
share it forecast earlier this month.  Some investors may have been expecting a higher profit
range for 2012 after the company posted first-quarter results at
the top-end of estimates, Wedbush Securities Inc. analyst
 Michael Pachter  said in a telephone interview.  “The company is being too conservative,” Pachter said.
“The street will not tolerate businesses that show sequential
decline.”  The annual profit forecast suggests lower quarterly
earnings for the rest of the year, Pachter said.  The company forecast second-quarter profit from continuing
operations of $1.09 a share to $1.24 a share, more than the
$1.05 average of analysts’ estimates.  Video-Game Rentals  Coinstar in October raised the price of a nightly rental
cost for standard DVDs to $1.20 from $1, saying that the fees
were expected to go up because of federal legislation. Prices
for Blu-ray disks and video-game rentals didn’t change.  Net income jumped to $53.7 million, or 1.65 a share, from
$8.5 million, or 26 cents, a year earlier.  Sales rose to $568.2 million from $424.1 million. In its
preliminary report on April 12, the company forecast sales to be
$567 million to $569.2 million.  Coinstar rose 3.3 percent to $67.51 at the close in New
York and has risen 48 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
