U.S. natural gas price forecasters
are having their worst year on record as producers boosted
output amid the mildest winter in 12 years.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows strategists tracked by Bloomberg
cut their 2012 price predictions by an average of 26 percent in
the first quarter, the most since Bloomberg began collecting the
data in 2008. Next-month gas dropped 29 percent in the first
quarter on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Marketed gas production will increase 4.5 percent this year
to average 69.22 billion cubic feet a day from an all-time high
last year, the Energy Department said April 10. Last winter was
the warmest since 2000 in the contiguous U.S., according to the
National Climatic Data Center. Gas reached a 10-year low of
$1.902 per million British thermal units on April 19 after
stockpiles ended the previous week at 2.512 trillion cubic feet,
a record for that time of year.  “It’s been pretty obvious for several years that we’ve
been heading in this direction,” J. Marshall Adkins, an energy
analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston, said
yesterday in a telephone interview. “The weather exacerbated
the problem but when gas supply is up 8 to 10 percent year-on-
year you’re going to have a problem.”  Gas will average $2.50 per million Btu this year, according
to Adkins. That compares with a median of $2.75 from 26 analyst
predictions compiled by Bloomberg. At the beginning of the year,
the consensus was for $4.40.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the fifth-largest U.S. bank by
assets, on April 11 lowered its 2012 estimate to $2.40 per
million British thermal units from $3.10. Commerzbank AG cut its
forecast to $2.25 from $3.25 on April 24. Morgan Stanley in
January cut its 2012 forecast by 30 percent to $2.70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
