Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  of Austria led
Czech shares lower after a two-day rally as euro-region economic
confidence declined more than forecast and Italyâ€™s funding costs
rose at a debt auction, hurting demand for riskier assets.  The stock tumbled 2.9 percent to 423 koruna by 11:57 a.m.
in  Prague , snapping a 7.9 percent gain in the previous two days.
The  PX (PX)  index of 14 equities, where Erste accounts for 19 percent
of the weighting, dropped 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
