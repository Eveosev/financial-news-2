U.K. mortgage approvals fell in
March to the lowest in 10 months after an increase earlier in
the year before the end of a tax holiday on some home purchases,
the British Bankers’ Association said.  Lenders granted 31,888 loans to buy homes, down from a
revised 32,840 in February, the London-based lobby group said in
an e-mailed report today. The average over the previous six
months was 34,920.  The BBA said mortgage approvals have “dropped back to more
normal trend levels after some increases earlier in the year as
first-time buyers sought to buy before the stamp duty exemption
ended in March.”  Gross mortgage lending was 8.3 billion pounds ($13.4
billion) in March, 6.1 percent higher than the same month a year
earlier. Capital repayment by households “remains at a high
level,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
