L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL) 
rose the most in more than a year after the maker of military
communications and electronics equipment boosted its full-year
profit forecast.  Raytheon Co. (RTN) , the world’s largest missile maker, and
 Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the nation’s biggest defense contractor,
also gained on higher defense profits. Shares of  General
Dynamics (GD)  Corp. fell after it reported a drop in first-quarter
profit yesterday.  Shares of L-3 climbed 5.1 percent to close today at $73.59
in New York trading, the biggest gain since Jan. 7, 2011. The
shares earlier rose as much as 6.8 percent for the biggest gain
since Nov. 21, 2008.  The defense contractor’s sales “exceeded our
expectations” in all segments, with the largest gains in the
company’s communications, intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance business, Joseph Nadol, a JPMorgan equity analyst
in  New York , wrote in a note to clients.  “That might get a better reception from the market than
other  defense results  this quarter,” Nadol wrote.  L-3, based in New York, raised its full-year earnings
forecast to $8.45 to $8.60 a share, from $8.35 to $8.55 a share.
The contractor’s shares had increased 5.9 percent this year
before today.  Profit in the first quarter rose 9 percent to $2.01 a share
from $1.85 a share in the year-earlier period, the company said
in a press release.  The BGOV Aerospace Index of nine defense contractors rose 1
percent today and has gained 12 percent this year.  Night-Vision Goggles  “Key wins” in the quarter included contracts for a Navy
hovercraft program, night-vision goggles and cabin assemblies
for  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s CH-47 Chinook helicopter, L-3 said.  Shares of Raytheon, based in Waltham,  Massachusetts , rose
1.9 percent to close at $53.93 in New York trading. They had
increased as much as 3.2 percent during the day, the biggest
gain since Nov. 30.  Profit from continuing operations is projected to be $5 to
$5.15 a share for the year compared with an earlier forecast of
$4.90 to $5.05, the company said today in a statement.  Bill Swanson, Raytheon’s chairman and chief executive
officer, is focusing on cost-cutting and international sales
because U.S. defense spending is expected to decline.  Lockheed shares rose less than 1 percent to $91.70 in New
York trading after the contractor said its first-quarter profit
rose 20 percent. They peaked at $92.24 during the day -- the
highest level since Oct. 20, 2008.  The Bethesda, Maryland-based company reaffirmed its 2012
forecast made in January of profit of $7.70 to $7.90 a share.  Oshkosh  Shares of another defense contractor,  Oshkosh Corp. (OSK) ,
climbed 1.9 percent to $23.38 after the company reported second-
quarter results that beat analysts’ expectations.  The military’s largest supplier of blast-resistant trucks
said profit in the quarter fell 45 percent to $37.3 million, or
41 cents a share, from $67.9 million, or 74 cents a share, in
the year-earlier period.  The Oshkosh, Wisconsin-based company said sales rose 19
percent to $2.08 billion for the quarter that ended March 31.  General Dynamics and  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , reported
first-quarter earnings yesterday.  Shares of General Dynamics, which makes Abrams battle tanks
and Gulfstream jets, fell less than 1 percent to $67.05, the
lowest level since Dec. 30.  Profit at the  Falls Church , Virginia-based company declined
to $564 million, or $1.57 a share, in the quarter from $618
million, or $1.64 a share, a year earlier, the company said.
Sales declined 2.8 percent, to $7.58 billion.  Shares of Northrop, also based in Falls Church, rose less
than 1 percent to $63.44, the highest level since July 26.  The company’s net income from continuing operations was
$506 million, or $1.96 a share, in the first quarter compared
with $496 million, or $1.67 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales declined 8 percent, to $6.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
