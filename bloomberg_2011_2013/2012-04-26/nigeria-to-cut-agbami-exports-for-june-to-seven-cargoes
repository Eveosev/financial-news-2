Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to reduce Agbami crude exports in June to seven
cargoes of 975,000 barrels each, one less than May, according to
a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will also ship four 950,000-barrel consignments
of Escravos and two 900,000-barrel lots of Okono grade,
unchanged from May, separate plans showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
