South African producer-price
 inflation  slowed for a fifth straight month in March, easing
pressure on the central bank to raise its benchmark lending rate
next month.  The cost of goods leaving factories and mines in  Africa ’s
biggest economy increased 7.2 percent, compared with 8.3 percent
in February, Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa  said on its
website today. The  median estimate  of 13 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 8 percent. Prices fell 0.1 percent in the month.  “You may see a softer rhetoric on inflation coming from
the South African Reserve Bank” at the next Monetary Policy
Committee meeting, Gina Schoeman, an economist at  Absa Group
Ltd. (ASA)  said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg today.
“This just eases the pressure on the Reserve Bank to do
anything soon.”  The central bank has kept its key  policy rate  unchanged at
5.5 percent, the lowest level in more three decades, since
November 2010 to help stimulate the economy. Consumer-price
inflation slowed to 6 percent in March, the top end of the
bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target, adding to expectations
rates will remain unchanged this year.  The price of white corn, a staple food in South Africa,
fell 4 percent in March on the South African Futures Exchange,
while oil declined 3.8 percent in  New York .  Consumer inflation will probably peak at 6.5 percent this
quarter before falling back into the target band by the end of
the year,  Reserve Bank  Governor Gill Marcus said on March 29.  The rand weakened 0.2 percent to 7.7621 a dollar at 12:15
p.m. in Johannesburg. The currency was at 7.7558 before the data
was released. The yield on the rand bond due in 2015 dropped six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.46 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
