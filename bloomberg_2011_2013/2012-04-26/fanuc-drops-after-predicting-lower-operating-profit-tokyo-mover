Fanuc Corp. (6954) , the world’s largest
maker of controls that run  machine tools , tumbled the most in
more than seven months in Tokyo trading after predicting a
decline in first-half operating profit.  The robot-maker slumped as much as 6.5 percent to 13,840
yen, the biggest intraday drop since Sept. 9. It was down 6.4
percent as of 10:55 a.m., the worst performance on the benchmark
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average. (NKY)   Operating profit may decline 3.1 percent in the six months
ending September as a weaker global economy saps sales, the
company said in a  statement  yesterday. Orders in the quarter
ended March also fell 2 percent, weighed down by poor demand in
China, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  The company’s forecast, operating profit and orders “were
all weaker than we expected,” the bank’s Tokyo-based analysts
Shinji Kuroda and Yunchao Zhao said in a note today. “The main
factor appears to be the slow recovery in demand for numerically
controlled equipment for local Chinese machine-tool makers.”  Still, the analysts reiterated an outperform rating on the
stock and recommended buying on dips.  To contact the reporter on this story:
