Brazil , which hosts 13 percent of
the world’s forests, passed a bill last night that may lead to a
culture of non-compliance with environmental law by providing
amnesty for some farmers that illegally cut trees, according to
Greenpeace Brasil.  The legislation, which was approved in a 274-184 vote,
creates a precedent by demonstrating to farmers that they will
be forgiven for future misdemeanors, Marcelo Furtado, executive
director of Sao Paulo-based environmental organization
Greenpeace Brasil, said today in a telephone interview.  Brazil’s lawmakers have been wrangling for a year over the
new rules as the nation seeks to balance its environmental and
agricultural interests. The nation has cleared a Germany-sized
tract of land from the world’s biggest rainforest and will host
the United Nations Earth Summit in  Rio de Janeiro  in June.  “This shows crime in agriculture pays,” Furtado said.
“It undermines farmers who were careful to comply with the law
and replanted what they were told to.”  The bill, which was first passed by the lower house in May
and then the Senate in December, forgives some farmers for
felling forests in protected areas before July 2008, Furtado
said.  Brazil is the world’s second most-forested country after
 Russia  with 521.7 million hectares of woodland covering 61
percent of its total area, the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization said on its  website .  About 34.7 million hectares of Amazonian rainforest were
cleared between 1990 and 2010, which is about the size of
 Germany , according to the National Institute for Space Research.  To contact the reporters on this story:
