(Corrects year to month in second paragraph.)  Airbus SAS may fail to reach its
A380 delivery target for 2012 as monthly production has slowed
to 2.3 planes from 2.7, French daily La Tribune reported.  The newspaper cited unidentified people at Airbus.
Production is likely to recover to three planes a month in 2013,
La Tribune said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
