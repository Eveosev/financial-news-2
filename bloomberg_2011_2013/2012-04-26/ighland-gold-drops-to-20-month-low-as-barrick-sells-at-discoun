Highland Gold Mining Ltd. (HGM) 
plunged to a 20-month low in London trading after  Barrick Gold
Corp. (ABX)  sold its 20 percent stake in the gold miner part-owned by
Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich at a discount.  Highland Gold slid as much as 9.7 percent to 118.75 pence,
the lowest intraday price since August 2010. The shares traded
at 125 pence as of 1:40 p.m. local time.  Barrick Gold, the world’s largest producer, sold its stake
in Highland Gold to undisclosed “institutional investors” at
120 pence a share, according to a statement today. The shares
closed at 131.5 pence yesterday.  “The large discount offered by the seller attracted
investors who hadn’t been looking at Highland previously,” said
Nikolay Sosnovskiy, an analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow. “The
sale price corresponds to enterprise value of two times earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is
really cheap for a gold company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
