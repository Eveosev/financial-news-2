Salzgitter AG (SZG) , Germany’s second-
biggest steelmaker, opposes a new pricing model for  iron ore 
implemented by Vale SA,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Heinz Joerg Fuhrmann.  The model, based on setting the price for iron ore after
delivery, “is like a blind date with the supplier,” as steel
makers agree with their customers on prices beforehand, the
newspaper cited Fuhrmann as saying.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
