Spanish demonstrators protesting
against the government’s action won’t be allowed to camp out on
 Madrid ’s Puerta del Sol square, Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said.  “There won’t be any camps set up because it is illegal,”
Diaz said in comments recorded by Cuatro Television and posted
on its website today.  Last year, Spaniards protesting against youth  unemployment ,
bank bailouts and corruption pitched tents in the square on May
15 and used Twitter Inc. to rally tens of thousands of people to
join them for demonstrations during a month-long sit-in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
