National Hockey League players who
wear dark jerseys are more likely to be penalized than those
wearing white, according to  a study  of more than 52,000 games
reported by  National Public Radio .  The study found that teams in dark jerseys were penalized
roughly two minutes more per game than those in white, according
to NPR. The research was conducted by  Gregory Webster  of the
University of  Florida , Geoffrey Urland of Toravner Research and
Design in Boulder,  Colorado , and Joshua Correll of the
 University of Chicago .  The three researchers analyzed data from 52,098 games over
30 NHL seasons.  The study did not reach a conclusion on the reason for the
discrepancy. Webster told NPR it is possible that players in
darker colors are more visible on the ice than players in white.
He also said it is possible that wearing dark colors makes
players either play in a more aggressive manner or appear more
aggressive in the eyes of a referee.  Before 2003, NHL teams typically wore white at home and
darker colors on the road. After a rule change in 2003, most
teams switched their color preferences, allowing the researchers
to determine whether the discrepancy in penalty minutes was a
factor of the home ice or jersey color, NPR said.  The researchers found that players wearing colored jerseys
at home games were called for more penalties than when they wore
white at home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
