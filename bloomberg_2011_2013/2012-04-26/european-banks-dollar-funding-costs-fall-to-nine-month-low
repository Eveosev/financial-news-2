The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell for the third day to the lowest in nine
months, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 43 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:18 a.m. in
 London  from minus 44 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The measure, which started the year at 114 basis points, is the
cheapest level since July 28.  The one-year basis swap was unchanged at 52 basis points
less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another was
little changed near a nine-month low. The Euribor-OIS spread,
the difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight
indexed swaps, was 39 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-
based  European Central Bank  yesterday, placing 782 billion euros
($1 trillion) with the ECB from 759 billion euros the day
before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
