Irish  home prices  were unchanged in
March from the previous month, the first time since August 2010
that values failed to decline, the statistics office said.  From a year earlier, values were down 16.3 percent in
March, and prices have dropped 49 percent since peaking in 2007,
the  Central Statistics Office  in Cork said on its website today.
In Dublin, property prices rose 0.7 percent in March from the
previous month, the first increase since May 2011.  Ireland’s decade-long housing bubble burst in 2008, helping
to plunge the country into the worst recession in its modern
history. The  unemployment rate  has tripled since then and the
country sought an international aid package in 2010.  Home prices 
could fall 70 percent from their 2007 peak, Dublin-based
securities firm Davy said last month.  “Monthly price data can be volatile,” Glas Securities, a
Dublin-based fixed-income firm, said in a note today.
“Nevertheless, today’s release will be welcomed. Forthcoming
price data will be closely monitored to establish if these
figures mark the early stages of a stabilisation.”  From a year earlier, residential property prices in Dublin
fell 18.3 percent, bringing the fall since 2007 to 57 percent
the CSO said. Excluding Dublin, Irish home values fell 0.6
percent in March from the prior month and were down 15.5 percent
from a year earlier.  About 14 percent of private home mortgages in Ireland were
either more than 90 days in arrears or had been restricted at
the end of 2011, according to the country’s central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
