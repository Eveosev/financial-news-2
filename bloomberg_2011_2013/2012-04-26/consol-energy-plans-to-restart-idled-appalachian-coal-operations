Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , the second-
largest U.S. coal producer by market value, will resume mining
at its Buchanan and Blacksville mines on May 1 after beginning
to sell to  India  and negotiating higher prices with steelmakers.  Consol renegotiated sales contracts with steelmaking
customers for 457,000 tons of low-volatility metallurgical coal,
according to a statement today. The company also contracted
224,000 tons of new sales at $119 a short ton. Consol announced
in February plans to idle its longwall mining operations at
Blacksville and stopped longwall operations at Buchanan in
March.  Consol reported first-quarter net income of $97.2 million,
or 42 cents a share, down 49 percent from $192.1 million, or 84
cents, a year earlier. That was 16 cents less than the  average 
estimate of 12 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 4.7
percent to $1.37 billion.  Mild weather and competition from natural gas drove down
demand for coal, according to J. Brett Harvey, the Pittsburgh-
based company’s chief executive officer.  “The very warm winter, weakened economy and low natural
gas prices have quickly turned a tight coal market into a
surplus,” Harvey said in the statement.  Consol expects to sell 4.1 million to 4.2 million tons of
low-volatility metallurgical coal this year, compared with a
previous forecast of 4.5 million to 5 million tons. The company
sold 1 million tons of the fuel in the first quarter, compared
with 1.4 million tons a year earlier. Operating costs per ton
rose 36 percent to $70.86.  Metallurgical coal is used in steelmaking, while power
utilities burn the thermal variety of the fuel to generate
electricity.  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)  is the largest U.S. coal
producer by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
