Spring sowing of oilseeds in  Russia 
is exceeding record rates in the past few years on early warmth
in the Volga and Altai areas, SovEcon said.  Farmers planted sunflower seeds on 435,000 hectares (1.1
million acres), double the year-earlier area, the Moscow-based
researcher said on its  website  today, citing figures from the
agriculture ministry.  Low temperatures delayed spring sowing by 10 to 14 days
across Russia, Deputy Agriculture Minister Shamil Vakhitov said
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
