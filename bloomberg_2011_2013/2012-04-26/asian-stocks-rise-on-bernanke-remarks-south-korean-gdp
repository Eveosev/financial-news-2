Asian  stocks  rose, with the
regional benchmark index gaining for a second day, after  Federal
Reserve  Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said he’s prepared to do more
to stimulate U.S. growth if needed.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , South Korea’s biggest consumer
electronics maker, climbed 2.7 percent. Hitachi Chemical Co.
jumped 6.7 percent in Tokyo on a rating boost by Credit Suisse
Group AG after the semiconductor materials supplier forecast
higher earnings. Fanuc Ltd. sank 6.1 percent after the maker of
factory robots said operating profit will fall.  “The Federal Reserve didn’t rule out the possibility of
additional monetary easing,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “That’s leading to confidence among investors.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.6 percent to 124.33
as of 6:58 p.m. in  Tokyo , with almost three shares rising for
every two that fell. Trading volumes in  Japan  and Hong Kong were
at least 22 percent lower than the 30-day average, while those
in Shanghai were about 23 percent higher, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Asian stocks extended a global rally
spurred by better-than-estimated earnings at companies from
Boeing Co. to Corning Inc.  South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 0.1 percent after the
economy expanded at the fastest pace in a year. Australia’s

percent.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.1 percent,
reversing gains of as much as 0.3 percent.  Potential for Gridlock  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  closed little changed,
erasing gains of as much as 0.7 percent, after ruling party
power broker Ichiro Ozawa was found not guilty of violating
campaign finance laws, raising concern this will embolden him to
oppose Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s plan to raise the
consumption tax.  “Foreign investors are looking at this and thinking, ‘this
will mean more chaos in government and less progress in the
debate on taxes,’” said Yoshihiro Ito, chief strategist at
Okasan Online Securities Co.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell less than
0.1 percent today. The gauge gained 1.4 percent in  New York 
yesterday as Bernanke said the Fed stands ready to add to its
stimulus if necessary even after leaving its policy unchanged
and upgrading its view of the  U.S. economy  for this year.  Exporters Gain  Asian exporters advanced after Fed policy makers said they
expect growth will gradually accelerate, while refraining from
new action to lower borrowing costs. Central bankers upgraded
their forecasts for economic growth and unemployment while
repeating their view that borrowing costs are likely to remain
“exceptionally low” at least through late 2014.  Samsung climbed 2.7 percent to 1.34 million won in Seoul.
 James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building materials supplier that
gets about 68 percent of sales from the U.S., gained 1.1 percent
to A$7.38 in Sydney. Techtronic Industries Co., the maker of
Ryobi power tools that counts North America as its largest
market, rose 2 percent to HK$9.63 in Hong Kong.  Hitachi Chemical advanced 6.7 percent to 1,514 yen in
Tokyo. Credit Suisse raised its rating to buy from neutral,
saying the company is benefiting from rising demand for raw
materials needed to make touch screens for smartphones and
tablets. The company said yesterday it expects operating profit
in the year ending March 2013 to increase 47 percent.  China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. (762) , the nation’s second-largest
mobile-phone company, jumped 4 percent to HK$13.54 after
reporting first-quarter net income rose to 1 billion yuan ($159
million) from a restated 145 million yuan a year earlier.  Fanuc, BYD  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 9.2 percent this year,
compared with a 10.6 percent advance by the  S&P 500  and a 4.8
percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 12.7 times  estimated earnings  on
average, compared with a multiple of 13.3 for the S&P 500 and
10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  Of the 154 companies on the regional benchmark index that
reported quarterly profits since April 10, 79 exceeded analysts
