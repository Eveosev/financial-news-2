The may strengthen as much as 1.5
percent to $1.6425 should it end the day’s trading above a key
level of so-called resistance, Commerzbank AG said, citing
trading patterns.  Sterling is set to advance to its highest level against the
dollar since August if it closes above $1.6167, said  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and currency technical
analysis in  London  at the bank.  “Pound-dollar is starting to erode the $1.6167
resistance,” Jones wrote in a note to clients today. “This is
the October 2011 high and the 61.8 percent retracement of the
move seen” in 2011-2012, she said, citing Fibonacci analysis.  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.6195 at 9:32 a.m.
London time, after reaching $1.6207, the highest level since
Sept. 2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  currency
pair  last traded at $1.6425 on Aug. 29, the data show.  “Today’s close will prove key,” she wrote. “A close
above $1.6167 will imply strength to $1.6425.” That level
represents the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the move
down from the 2011 peak, according to Jones.  “While above $1.6062 support, the market remains bid,”
Jones said. “Only a move back below here alleviates immediate
upward pressure.”  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
new high or low. A breach of one level often implies an
extension of the move to the next.  Resistance refers to an area on a chart where technical
analysts anticipate orders to sell a security to be clustered. A
support level is an area where they anticipate buy orders will
be grouped. In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study
charts of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
