Qatar is giving  Tunisia  a $1
billion loan, half of which will be allocated to support the
central bank, the official Tunisian  news agency  reported.  Qatar also expressed a willingness to provide 20,000 jobs
to Tunisians in Qatar, Agence Tunis Afrique Presse said, citing
the presidential spokesman, Adnen Mnasser. The announcements
follow a visit by Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki to Qatar
this month.  The economy of Tunisia, the North African birthplace of
last year’s uprisings across the Arab world, contracted by 1.8
percent in 2011, according to official figures.  Tunisia has already received a $500 million Qatari loan,
according to a central bank statement last week. The five-year
loan carries an annual interest rate of 2.5 percent, it said.
The bank’s spokesman, Zied Mouhli, said by telephone today that
he couldn’t immediately give any details of the loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
