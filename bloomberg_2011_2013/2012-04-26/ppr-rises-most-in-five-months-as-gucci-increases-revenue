PPR SA (PP) , the French owner of the
Gucci luxury brand, rose the most in almost five months in Paris
trading after the company reported first-quarter sales that
exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The shares gained as much as 5.3 percent to 126 euros, the
steepest intraday advance since Nov. 30 and the third-biggest
climb in the French benchmark CAC Index.  PPR said late yesterday that revenue from continuing
operations rose 15 percent to 3.26 billion euros ($4.3 billion)
in the first quarter, exceeding the 3.15 billion-euro average of
six analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding
acquisitions and currency swings, the growth was 7.9 percent.  Revenue growth of 33 percent at the Bottega Veneta luxury
brand and 40 percent at  Yves Saint Laurent  “smashed
expectation,” Simon Irwin, an analyst at Liberum Capital in
London, said in a note. PPR “did enough to reassure fears over
Gucci,” where sales climbed 12 percent on a comparable basis,
matching the gain in the previous quarter.  PPR was up 4.3 percent at 124.90 euros as of 9:23 a.m. in
Paris, valuing the company at 15.7 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
