The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
advanced for a third day, rising 0.7 percent to 34,251.43 by the
close in Johannesburg.  The following are among the most active equities in the
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , the world’s third-largest
producer of the metal, gained the most in three months, climbing
3.7 percent to 270.25 rand. Gold jumped after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said he is prepared to do more to boost
U.S. economic growth if necessary, weakening the dollar and
boosting the appeal of bullion as a store of value.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , South Africa’s second-largest
producer of the metal, added 3.4 percent to 101.39 rand.  British American Tobacco Plc (BTI)  , Europe’s largest

growth of 6 percent, beating the 5.1 percent average estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Excellerate Holdings Ltd. (EXL)  , a provider of cleaning
and parking services, fell to the lowest in more than three
weeks, dropping 6.2 percent to 1.22 rand. The company is
considering delisting from JSE Ltd., it said in a statement
today.  Santova Logistics Ltd. (SNV)  , a clearing agent for
importers and exporters, climbed to the highest in more than two
months, jumping 11 percent to 82 cents. Earnings per share for
the year through February will be about 15.82 cents, an increase
