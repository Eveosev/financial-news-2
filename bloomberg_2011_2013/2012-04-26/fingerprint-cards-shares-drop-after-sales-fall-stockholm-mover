Fingerprint Cards AB (FINGB)  fell the most
in eight months in Stockholm after first-quarter revenue
declined 59 percent and the maker of biometric technology said
sales prospects for the second quarter appear weak.  The shares dropped as much as 19 percent, the biggest
intraday fall since Aug. 18. Gothenburg, Sweden-based
Fingerprint Cards was down 12 percent at 6.05 kronor as of
9:54 a.m., the second-biggest decline on the Stockholm All Share
index.  First-quarter sales dropped to 5.2 million kronor
($777,000) from 12.8 million a year earlier, Fingerprint Cards
said today in a statement. The company said delays in a couple
of major bank projects in  China  caused stockpiling at
distributors. While the company sees “weak” sales in the
second quarter it kept its forecast for 2012 unchanged.
Fingerprint Cards said Feb. 9 it expected sales this year to be
between 70 million kronor and 90 million kronor.  “Sometimes wine, sometimes water is a fitting description
for the first quarter of 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Johan Carlstroem said in today’s statement. “While sales matched what
we budgeted, they were lower than we had hoped.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
