More than 68,000 firearms recovered
by  Mexico  during the past five years were traced back to the
U.S., according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives.  The guns found to be manufactured or legally imported in
the U.S. accounted for two-thirds of the more than 99,000
weapons submitted by the Mexican government to the U.S. for
tracing from 2007 to 2011, according to an ATF statement today.  The guns recovered and traced arenâ€™t t representative of
all gun crimes committed in Mexico, according to a report by the
agency.  Guns whose origin is the U.S. were either manufactured in
the country or legally imported by a firearms dealer, according
to ATF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
