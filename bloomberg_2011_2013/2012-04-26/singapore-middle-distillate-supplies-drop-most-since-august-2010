Middle-distillate inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
18 percent, the most since August 2010, according to a unit of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene dropped 1.99 million barrels to 8.83 million in the
seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
in an e-mailed statement. That’s the biggest percentage decline
since the period ended Aug. 18, 2010.  Residual-fuel supplies including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen rose 2.84 million barrels, or
17 percent, to 19.2 million, the ministry’s data showed. That’s
the largest increase in three months.  Supplies of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate were down 340,000 barrels, or 3.2 percent, at 10.4
million, a four-week low, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
