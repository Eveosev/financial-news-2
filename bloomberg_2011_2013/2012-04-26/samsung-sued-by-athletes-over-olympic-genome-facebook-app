Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  was sued by
a group of 18 Olympic athletes who claim the “Samsung Olympic
Genome Project” application for  Facebook  uses their names and
images without their permission.  The athletes, including swimmer Mark Spitz, diver Greg Louganis, and track and field star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, said in
a complaint filed yesterday in state court in Los Angeles that
Samsung uses their names and images to create the impression
that they endorse its products.  The Facebook application also includes background
information about the athletes, as well as an advertisement for
Samsung’s Galaxy, and it links to the Suwon, South Korea-based
company’s website, according to the complaint.  The athletes seek unspecified damages for misappropriation
of their names and images.  Samsung has followed the U.S. Olympic Committee’s procedure
to communicate with athletes, who had the opportunity express
their opinions and make a decision on whether to participate,
the Suwon, South Korea-based company said in a statement today.  The case is Mark Spitz v. Samsung, BC483475, California
Superior Court ( Los Angeles ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
