Fiat SpA (F) , the Italian carmaker that
controls Chrysler Group LLC, posted a wider first-quarter loss
in Europe as the automaker’s sales in the region plunged.  The loss before interest, taxes and one-time items in
Europe nearly doubled to 207 million euros ($274 million), the
Turin, Italy-based company said in a statement today. The shares
fell as much as 5.7 percent.  Without Chrysler, Fiat would have reported a 6 million-euro
trading loss in the period as the sovereign debt crisis and a
lack of new models at the Italian automaker hit demand. Fiat’s
deliveries in the region tumbled 20 percent in the first
quarter, outpacing the industrywide 7.3 percent drop.  The loss in  Europe  “is not good and indicative of just how
difficult it is to operate in the euro zone,” said  David Arnold , a sales specialist at Credit Suisse Group AG in  London .  Fiat fell as much as 23 cents to 3.71 euros and was down
5.1 percent as of 4:58 p.m. in Milan trading. Fiat is the
 second-worst performer  in the 14-member Euro Stoxx autos and
parts index after  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  over the past 12 months.  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of both
automakers, is counting on Chrysler, which was consolidated into
Fiat’s results in June, to propel the group’s profit. First-
quarter trading profit more than tripled to 866 million euros
from 251 million euros a year earlier on demand for Chrysler 200
and 300 sedans in the U.S. Revenue more than doubled to 20.2
billion euros.  Volkswagen Profit  Fiat owns 58.5 percent of Chrysler, and Marchionne, 59,
plans to merge the two manufacturers to boost sales to more than
100 billion euros by 2014 to challenge  Volkswagen AG. (VOW)   The German automaker today reported a 10 percent gain in
first-quarter operating profit to 3.21 billion euros, beating
analysts’ estimates. Sales rose 26 percent to 47.3 billion
euros, boosted by demand for the Audi A6 and A8 luxury sedans.  Volkswagen’s performance contrasts with other European
competitors. Peugeot, the region’s second-biggest carmarker,
yesterday said sales fell 7.3 percent to 14.3 billion euros in
the first quarter.  France ’s  Renault SA (RNO)  reported a 9 percent
decline in revenue to 9.54 billion euros in the quarter.  Fiat, which shut down a factory in Sicily at the end of
last year, froze new investment in Europe and postponed the
introduction of new models because the company doesn’t
anticipate a demand recovery until at least next year.  Painful Restructuring  Marchionne, 59, sees a ’painful’ restructuring needed for
European carmakers, including plant closures and job cuts, to
reduce an estimate 20 percent excess of capacity in the region,
he said last month.  First-quarter profit in  Latin America  dropped to 235
million euros from 306 million euros “driven by price pressure
from imports by other carmakers,” The Italian company. Fiat’s
luxury brands, Ferrari and Maserati SpA, posted a 15 percent
increase in trading profit to 71 million euros.  Net debt rose 300 million euros to 5.8 billion euros in the
first three months of the year, surpassing the 5.4 billion-euro
estimate by seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fiat today confirmed its 2012 targets, “despite the lack
of visibility regarding any bottoming out of the European
market,” including as much as 4.5 billion euros in trading
profit for the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
