Parnon Energy Inc., an oil
logistics company, and Arcadia Petroleum Ltd., a London-based
oil trader, failed to get a U.S. regulator’s lawsuit thrown out
that claims they manipulated  oil prices  in 2007 and 2008.  U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III in  Manhattan 
today turned down the companies’ bid to dismiss a complaint
filed in May 2011 by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. The agency contends the companies illegally made
more than $50 million trading derivatives tied to West Texas
Intermediate crude oil.  Pauley rejected the companies’ arguments that the
commission hadn’t adequately alleged violations of the law.  In addition to the companies, the CFTC sued James Dyer and
Nicholas Wildgoose, who directed derivatives trading for both
enterprises, according to the CFTC. They amassed a stockpile of
crude oil in order to dominate supplies, then bought long and
short positions in oil futures to make gains on the
“artificial” rise in prices, the agency claimed.  Timothy Carey, a lawyer representing the defendants, didn’t
immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the
ruling.  Parnon Energy, based in Rancho  Santa Fe ,  California , and
London-based Arcadia Petroleum, are subsidiaries of Farahead
Holdings Inc., a closely held company based in Cyprus.  The case is U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v.

District of  New York  (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
