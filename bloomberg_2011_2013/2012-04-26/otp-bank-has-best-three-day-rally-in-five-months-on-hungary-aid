OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s biggest
lender, headed for its steepest three-day advance in almost five
months after the European Union’s most-indebted eastern member
state yesterday won approval to start bailout talks.  The stock climbed 0.8 percent to 3,840 forint by 11:30 a.m.
in Budapest. A close at that level would mark a 14 percent gain
in three days, the most since the same period ended Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
