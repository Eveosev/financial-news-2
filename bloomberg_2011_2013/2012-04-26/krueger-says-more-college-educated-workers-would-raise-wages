Alan Krueger, chairman of the White
House Council of Economic Advisers, said boosting the number of
Americans who go on to higher education would be the most
effective way to raise wages for workers.  The slowing progress in educational attainment has been the
biggest contributor to stagnating incomes, Krueger said today in
an interview with  Kathleen Hays  on Bloomberg Radio’s “The Hays
Advantage.”  “The most important factor is that we stopped investing as
much as we had been in higher education,” said Krueger, a labor
economist on leave from  Princeton University .  The U.S. had “the highest educated 60-year-olds in the
world” while “30-year-olds are in the middle of the pack,”
Krueger said.  U.S. median household income in 2010 fell to its lowest
level since 1996, slipping to $49,445 from $50,599 the year
before, the Census Bureau reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
