Yuan forwards snapped a three-day
decline after  China ’s central bank set a record reference rate
for the currency and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said he’s prepared to do more to stimulate U.S. economic growth.  The People’s Bank of China raised the  fixing  0.15 percent
to 6.2829 per dollar, the strongest level since a peg ended in
July 2005. The Fed reiterated a pledge yesterday to keep U.S.
borrowing costs “exceptionally low” through 2014 and upgraded
its economic growth forecast for the world’s largest economy.
The fourth round of the  U.S.-China strategic and economic
dialogue  will start in Beijing in a week’s time and be attended
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Secretary of
State  Hillary Clinton  and Chinese Vice Premier  Wang Qishan .  “A better U.S. outlook will boost prospects for Chinese
exports and hence support the yuan,” said Banny Lam, a Hong
Kong-based economist at CCB International Securities Ltd., a
unit of China’s second-largest bank. “China typically
strengthens the reference rate before high-level meetings with
the U.S. to promote a positive atmosphere for talks.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards strengthened 0.04
percent to 6.3478 per dollar as of 4:51 p.m. in Hong Kong, a 0.7
percent discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan slipped 0.03 percent to close at 6.3060 in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System,
after advancing as much 0.09 percent earlier. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the central
bank’s daily fixing. In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan
gained 0.03 percent to 6.3038.  ‘Slow Process’  One-month implied volatility for the currency, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 10 basis points,
or 0.1 percentage point, to 2 percent.  The record fixing “should not be interpreted as a sudden
shift towards renewed appreciation,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong
Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB, wrote in a
research note today. The yuan will gain “in a slow process” to
6.2 per dollar by the end of 2012, he forecast.  China’s economy  may grow about 8.7 percent this year, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday, citing a report
by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The  trade surplus  may
be $126 billion, Xinhua said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
