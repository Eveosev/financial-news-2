Global regulators may seek to
toughen regulation of  repurchase agreements  on concerns that
such trades pose potential threats to market stability, the
Financial Stability Board said in a report on its website.  Markets for repurchase agreements, or repos, and other
types of so-called securities financing are “complex, rapidly
evolving and can be opaque for some market participants and
policymakers,” the FSB said. The deals can increase “risk-
taking within the financial system in a pro-cyclical and
potentially destabilizing way.”  Threats to stability may arise from “insufficient rigour”
in how collateral in such trades is valued and from “fire
sales” of collateral when a party to a trade defaults, the FSB
said.  Repos are contracts where one investor agrees to sell a
security and then buy it back at a future date and a fixed
price. They’re among several so-called shadow banking activities
being targeted by the Group of 20 nations on concerns they may
be used to evade a clamp-down on excessive risk taking.  The FSB, which brings together regulators, G-20 central
bankers and finance ministry officials, warned last year that
shadow banks may create “an opportunity for regulatory
arbitrage.”  The board is also examining so-called securities lending
agreements, in which institutional investors such as pension
funds lend financial instruments against cash collateral.  The group is seeking views on its report until May 25. The
board will “develop appropriate policy measures to address
risks, where necessary, by the end of 2012,” it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
