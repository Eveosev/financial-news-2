The U.K. government should give
police more resources to prevent the theft of cable from the
rail network, lawmakers said in a report today.  The Department for Transport dismissed a recommendation
made in January by the cross-party House of Commons Transport
Committee to increase police funding to better combat cable
theft. The government said legislation introduced that month,
banning cash payments for scrap metal and raising fines for
handling stolen metal, would suffice to stem the pilfering.  “Cable theft continues to disrupt train journeys for
thousands of passengers across the U.K.,”  Louise Ellman , the
opposition Labour parliamentarian who heads the Transport
Committee, said in a statement in  London . “I am disappointed
that the government will not provide further resources for the
police to tackle metal theft.”  The theft of railway cables, driven by increased copper
prices, delayed or halted 35,000 trains and cost the U.K.’s rail
network 16 million pounds ($26 million) last year, according to
the Transport Committee. The government is granting the British
Transport Police 5 million pounds to create a metal-theft  task
force .  To contact the reporter on this story:
