Strayer Education Inc. (STRA) , a for-
profit college with most of its campuses in the eastern U.S.,
rose the most in five months after saying quarterly new student
enrollment increased 12 percent.  Strayer plans to open eight new campuses in 2012 if it gets
approval from regulators, the Herndon, Virginia-based company
said today in its first-quarter earnings statement. The stock
rose 15 percent to $99.05 at the close of trading in New York.  For-profit college enrollment has been falling as Congress,
the U.S. Justice Department and state attorneys general have
investigated their marketing practices, and the Education
Department restricted recruiting. This is the first quarter that
Strayer has recorded growth in new student sign-ups since its
second quarter of 2010, said Jeffrey Silber, an analyst with BMO
Capital Markets in  New York .  Strayer’s new enrollment increase is “likely one of the
better performances to be seen this quarter,” he said in a note
to clients. He rates the company “market perform,” and said
the increase was “unexpected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
