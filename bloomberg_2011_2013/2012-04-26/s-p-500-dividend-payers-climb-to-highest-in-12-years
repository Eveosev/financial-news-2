More Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
companies are paying  dividends  than at any time since January
2000 after  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  and six other
corporations initiated payouts this year.  The number has risen to 401, according to data compiled by
 Howard Silverblatt , S&P’s senior index analyst. His estimate for
total payouts this year, which Silverblatt said is under review,
is a record $279 billion.  Nasdaq OMX, the second-biggest U.S. operator of stock
exchanges, announced its first dividend yesterday. Apple, the
world’s biggest company by market value, unveiled one in March
after canceling its program in 1996.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  increased
its dividend yesterday for the 30th straight year, making its
$10.7 billion annual distribution the largest in the world,
according to Silverblatt.  Companies are increasing shareholder returns in the form of
dividends and buybacks after the 2008 financial crisis led them
to hoard  cash  to a record $1 trillion by the end of 2011. The
rise in payouts coincides with a 13th quarter of  better-than-
estimated earnings .  “Given underlying fundamentals, low payouts and cash
reserves, 2012 should set a record high for cash dividend
payments,” Silverblatt wrote in an e-mail today.  S&P 500 companies distributed a record $248 billion in cash
to shareholders in 2008, when 372 companies paid dividends,
according to his report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
