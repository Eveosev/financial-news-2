Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  is selling its
fourth structured note in six months that targets Italian
investors and pays returns based on the number of days interbank
lending rates stay within a set boundary.  Germany ’s biggest bank is offering about 82 million euros
($108 million) of the so-called range-accrual notes, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors in the six-year securities, which are due to be
issued on May 15, will receive a fixed interest rate of 4
percent in the first year, Bloomberg data show. In the five
years after that, returns will be calculated based on how long
the three-month euro interbank offered rate remains in a range
of 0.6 percent to 3 percent, compared with 0.724 percent
yesterday.  Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank raised 278.8 million euros
from the securities since November, the largest of which was a
159 million-euro note sold in February.  Nick Bone, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in  London ,
declined to comment.  A total of 20 banks raised $906 million from selling range-
accrual notes tied to interbank lending rates this year, with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. the No.1 issuer, according to Bloomberg
data, which exclude U.S. domestic-market issuance. That’s down
62 percent from the same period in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
