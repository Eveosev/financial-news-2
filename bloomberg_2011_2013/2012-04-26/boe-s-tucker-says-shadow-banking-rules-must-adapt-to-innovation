Bank of England Deputy Governor
 Paul Tucker  said new rules to regulate shadow banking must be
able to adapt to innovation in the financial-services industry.  “It would be foolhardy to imagine that we can frame
policies today that will stand the test of time,” Tucker, who
is in charge of financial stability at the central bank, said in
the text of a speech he is schedule to deliver in Brussels
today. “The financial system will evolve, and we need to permit
innovation. A policy framework on shadow banking therefore needs
to be adaptive. And it mustn’t try to shut everything down.”  In remarks examining the various types of shadow banking,
Tucker said vehicles that are sponsored or operated by banks
should be consolidated onto banks’ balance sheets. He also said
that only banks should be able to use clients’ assets such as
cash or securities to finance their own business. Institutions
that aren’t banks should segregate such assets, he said.  Still, Tucker said that non-bank finance “is not a bad
thing in itself.”  “Indeed, it can be a very good thing, helping to make
financial services more efficient and effective and the system
as a whole more resilient,” he said. “We must remember that as
we make policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
