Gorenje Group d.d.  expanded its
business in  Serbia  as  Slovenia ’s largest appliance maker seeks
to cut costs.  Gorenje, based in Velenje, signed an agreement with the
Serbian government to expand its refrigerator unit in the
western town of Valjevo in an investment worth 20 million euros
($26 million), the Slovenian company said in a regulatory
 statement  today. The new facility will create 400 jobs by 2015
and the government in the capital Belgrade will provide 10,000
euros for each new employee, it said.  The project is part of “Gorenje’s activities to optimize
the manufacturing operations,” the company said in the
statement. The decision “will not affect the level of
employment at our factories in Slovenia.”  Gorenje, Slovenia’s biggest exporting company, is seeking
to cut costs by relocating some production from Western Europe
to the eastern part of the continent with lower taxes and wages
as the appliance maker tackles rising commodity prices. Last
month, it said it will relocate its cooker producing plant from
Lahti in  Finland  to the  Czech Republic .  To contact the reporter on this story:
