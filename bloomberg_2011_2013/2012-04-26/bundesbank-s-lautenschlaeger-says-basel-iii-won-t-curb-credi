     April 26 (Bloomberg) --Bundesbank Vice President Sabine Lautenschlaeger said the new Basel III banking rules are
unlikely to make it more difficult for German companies to
obtain credit.  “The provision of credit for  Germany ’s real economy is not
in danger” because of higher capital and liquidity rules for
banks, Lautenschlaeger said at an event in Stuttgart today.
“Quite the opposite seems to be the case.”  Capital and liquidity rules for banks in an agreement known
as Basel III were enacted by international regulators in 2010 in
a move to help protect the world’s economy after the worst
financial crisis in decades. The regulations, which need to be
implemented by 2019, require some banks to hold more capital.  All of the Basel III reforms are subject to studies about
their short-term and long-term impact on the banking system and
the real economy, Lautenschlaeger said.  “These studies have shown that while there are going to be
effects on the real economy, the short-term impact is going to
be marginal,” she said. “In the longer term, the rules will
foster prosperity as financial crises are going to become less
likely, Basel Committee experts found.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
