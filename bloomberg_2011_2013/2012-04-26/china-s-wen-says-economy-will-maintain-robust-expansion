China  is ready to lend $10 billion
for infrastructure projects in central and eastern Europe while
boosting trade ties with the region, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said.  “The global economy has begun to perform better since the
beginning of the year but the recovery is still uncertain,” Wen
said today in a speech to a regional economic forum in Warsaw,
according to a Polish translation of his remarks. “We have to
face this challenge together.”  China will set up a $10 billion  credit line  “to support
infrastructure and green-economy” projects in the region, Wen
said. It’s also ready to sign currency-exchange agreements with
eastern European countries with the goal of doubling bilateral
foreign trade in five years, he added.  Eastern European economies are threatened by the debt
crisis afflicting their neighbors to the west, which buy the
majority of exports from the region and whose lenders control
about three quarters of its banking assets. The Chinese leader
is on the last stop of a European trip that took him to Iceland,
 Germany  and Sweden.  “China is aware of the concerns about trade imbalances
expressed in Europe and is prepared to increase its imports from
the region,” Wen told the business gathering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
