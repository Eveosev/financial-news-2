Chilean President Sebastian Pinera
will propose changes to a fuel price stabilization program that
would cut prices at pumps, La Tercera  reported , citing
participants of a meeting with Pinera whom it didn’t name.  The modifications, which will be part of a series of tax
changes the president will unveil today, would reduce gasoline
prices by as much as 50 pesos ($0.10) per liter, the Santiago-
based newspaper reported. Premium gasoline costs an average of
855 pesos per liter in Santiago, according to the government’s
National Energy Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
