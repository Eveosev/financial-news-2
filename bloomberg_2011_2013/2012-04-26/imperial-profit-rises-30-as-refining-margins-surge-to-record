Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , the Canadian
company that’s 70 percent-owned by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , said
first-quarter profit rose 30 percent, helped by rising oil
prices and record refining profit.  Net income rose to C$1.02 billion ($1.04 billion), or
C$1.19 per share, from C$781 million, or 91 cents, a year
earlier, the Calgary-based company said in a statement today.
Excluding a gain from an asset sale and other one-time items,
per-share profit was 16 Canadian cents more than the average of
11 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Downstream net income surged 65 percent to an all-time
record of C$455 million, mostly because of Imperial’s ability to
process heavily discounted Western Canadian crudes, according to
the statement. Average output at Imperial fell 6.8 percent to
the equivalent of 289,000 barrels from a year earlier, while
sales rose 9.6 percent to C$7.53 billion.  Imperial, like other producers, benefited from an increase
in the price of crude, which traded at an average $103.03 a
barrel in  New York  during the first three months of the year,
8.9 percent more than a year earlier.  Imperial expects its Kearl oil-sands project to begin
operating in late 2012. The project is expected to have initial
capacity to produce 110,000 barrels a day, rising to 345,000
barrels by the end of this decade, according to the company’s
website.  Imperial rose 0.2 percent to C$45.34 at the close in
Toronto. The stock has five buy, nine hold and two sell  ratings 
from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
