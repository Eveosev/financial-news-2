Gold rose the most in two weeks on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  may increase stimulus
measures to bolster the U.S. economy after more Americans than
forecast filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last week.  Jobless  claims  fell by 1,000 to 388,000 in the week ended
April 21, from a revised 389,000 a week earlier, which was the
highest since early January, Labor Department figures showed
today. The median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 375,000. Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said yesterday that the central bank will do more to
fuel growth if necessary.  “The job market is softening, and the Federal Reserve may
be forced to look at some form of easing,” James Cordier,
portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa,  Florida , said
in a telephone interview. “Investors have started pricing that
in.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose 1.1 percent to settle
