The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
dropped 0.5 percent to 930.2 at the close in Prague, snapping
two days of gains.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of  Austria  fell 2.8 percent,
the most in three weeks, to 423.3 koruna as euro-region economic
confidence declined more than forecast and Italy’s funding costs
rose at a debt auction.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, rose 0.7 percent to 126.1 koruna.  Commodities advanced after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke yesterday signaled that U.S. central bankers may extend
stimulus if conditions worsen for the world’s largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
