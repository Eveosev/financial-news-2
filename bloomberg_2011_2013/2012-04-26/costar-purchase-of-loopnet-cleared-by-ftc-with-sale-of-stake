The U.S. Federal Trade Commission
approved  CoStar Group Inc. (CSGP) ’s $860 million acquisition of LoopNet
Inc. on condition the combined firm sells its stake in a company
that also provides commercial real estate data.  In addition, CoStar, the largest provider of commercial
real estate information services in the U.S., must lift non-
compete provisions and refrain from bundling its products in
ways that could hurt competition, the FTC said today in an e-
mailed statement.  CoStar, based in  Washington , will sell LoopNet’s stake in
Xceligent, which tracks and aggregates commercial real estate
listings and property information in 33 cities, to make sure the
company will remain an active competitor, the FTC said.  “By maintaining Xceligent as an independent competitor and
ensuring Xceligent’s ability to grow and expand, the FTC’s
settlement order will foster continued competition in these
markets,” said Richard Feinstein, director of the agency’s
Bureau of Competition.  Under the proposed order, Xceligent will be sold to DMG
Information Inc., a U.S.-based subsidiary of British media and
data conglomerate Daily Mail & General Trust, Plc, the FTC said.  CoStar and San Francisco-based  LoopNet (LOOP)  are the only two
providers of commercial real estate listings databases with
nationwide coverage, the FTC said. Listings databases compile
information about commercial real estate properties for sale or
lease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
