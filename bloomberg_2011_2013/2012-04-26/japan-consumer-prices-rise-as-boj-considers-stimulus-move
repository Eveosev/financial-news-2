Japan ’s consumer prices rose in
March, according to a report released as the central bank
decides today on monetary policy.  Prices excluding fresh food increased 0.2 percent from a
year earlier, the statistics bureau said today in Tokyo. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 31 economists was
for a 0.1 percent gain.  The  Bank of Japan ’s inflation forecast, also due today, may
show the 1 percent goal adopted in February remains elusive.
Economists unanimously forecast the bank will add to stimulus as
lawmakers press for aggressive steps to spur growth and shake
off more than a decade of deflation.  “Additional easing at today’s meeting is almost a done
deal,”  Yoshimasa Maruyama , chief economist at  Itochu Corp. (8001)  in
Tokyo, said before the report.  Shirakawa aims to contain expectations for monetary action
in the face of pressure from lawmakers in the ruling  Democratic
Party  of Japan and opposition Liberal Democratic Party. In a
speech in the U.S. earlier this month, he said that central
banks “cannot reasonably deliver solutions to structural
issues” and the key challenge for Japan is rapidly changing
demographics.  “Considering that the Japanese financial conditions are
probably the most expansionary among developed economies, the
failure of Japan to shake off modest deflation can mostly be
explained by its deteriorating growth potential,” the central
banker said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
