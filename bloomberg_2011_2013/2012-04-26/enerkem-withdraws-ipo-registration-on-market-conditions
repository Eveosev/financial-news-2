Enerkem Inc. (NKM) , the Canadian biofuel
company backed by  Waste Management Inc. (WM)  and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ,
withdrew its registration to raise as much as $137.8 million
through an initial public offering, citing market conditions.  The company, based in Montreal, had planned to sell 7.25
million shares at $17 to $19 apiece. Enerkem develops refineries
that convert trash into gases, which are processed into ethanol
and chemicals.  Enerkem is the second renewable-energy company to pull its
IPO this month, after  BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) , a developer of
solar plants, withdrew its registration on April 12.  “In light of current market conditions, the company has
determined not to proceed with the initial public offering,”
Enerkem said today in a  filing .  To contact the reporter on this story:
