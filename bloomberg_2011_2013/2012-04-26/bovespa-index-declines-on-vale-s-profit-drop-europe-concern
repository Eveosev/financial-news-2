The Bovespa  index (MXBR0CD)  rose as consumer
stocks gained after the central bank signaled further interest-
rate cuts and  Vale SA (VALE3)  jumped after saying it will meet its sales
target for this year.  Vale, the world’s second-largest mining company,
contributed most to the gauge’s advance. Banco BTG Pactual SA
rose in the first day of trading after raising as much as 3.66
billion reais ($1.94 billion) in an initial public offering.
 Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes , the
country’s second-biggest homebuilder by revenue, was the best
performer on the MSCI Brazil/Consumer Discretionary Index.  The Bovespa rose 0.7 percent to 62,198.06 at the close in
Sao Paulo. Forty-one stocks declined while 26 advanced. The real
weakened 0.3 percent to 1.8847 per  U.S. dollar  at 5:38 p.m.
local time.  “The minutes from the policy meeting last week confirmed
that the central bank will keep cutting rates further, which
helps explain why consumer stocks and retailers are performing a
bit better today,” Gustavo Mendonca, an economist at Oren
Investimentos, said by phone from  Rio de Janeiro . “Vale fell in
the first hours of trading after its earnings were released, but
it looks like officials were able to regain investors’
confidence during their conference call.”  Brazil’s economy is recovering more slowly than expected,
and any additional interest-rate cuts should be carried out with
“parsimony,” the central bank said in the minutes to its April
17-18 meeting released today. Vale declined as much as 3 percent
after reporting a third consecutive drop in quarterly profit and
then rebounded after Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira
said on a conference call that the company will meet its sales
targets for this year.  Vale, PDG Realty  Vale gained 1.7 percent to 41.78 reais. Cyrela advanced 2.3
percent to 17.10 reais. Retailer Lojas Americanas SA jumped 2.3
percent to 17.39 reais. BTG Pactual gained 0.6 percent to 31.45
reais.  Natura Cosmeticos SA,  Brazil ’s biggest cosmetics maker,
fell 4.3 percent to 43.31 reais, the steepest drop in seven
months, after first-quarter profit trailed estimates. The
company said net income was 151.5 million reais, below the 159.3
million reais average estimate for profit excluding some items
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Brazil’s benchmark equity  measure  has gained 9.6 percent
this year, buoyed by local interest-rate cuts, signs of
expansion in the U.S. and speculation  Europe  may be closer to
resolving its sovereign-debt crisis. The gauge has fallen 9
percent since this year’s high on March 13 as signs of a
slowdown in  China  spurred speculation that demand for
commodities exports may falter.  The Bovespa trades at 10.3 times analysts’ earnings
estimates for 2012, in line with the 10.6 ratio for MSCI Inc.’s
measure of 21 developing nations’ equities, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Trading  volume  was 8.12 billion reais in stocks in  Sao
Paulo  today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with
a daily average of 7.23 billion reais this year through April
25, according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
