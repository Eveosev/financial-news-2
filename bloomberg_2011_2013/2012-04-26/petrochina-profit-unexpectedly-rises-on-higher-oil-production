PetroChina Co. (857) ’s first-quarter
profit rose unexpectedly after it ramped up oil and gas
production, while  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) ’s earnings
slumped on losses from selling fuels at state-controlled prices.  Net income  rose 5.8 percent from a year earlier to 39.2
billion yuan ($6.2 billion), PetroChina reported yesterday,
beating the 34.8 billion yuan mean estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. Profit at Sinopec, as China Petroleum is known, slumped
35 percent, almost triple the pace forecast by analysts.  PetroChina rose the most in more than three months in Hong
Kong trading after earnings outperformed global rivals  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)  State-owned PetroChina
and Sinopec are buying energy assets abroad to diversify from
refining and are pressing the government to deliver on its
pledge to relax controls on gasoline and diesel prices.  “Both Chinese companies are living at the mercy of China’s
fuel-prices reforms,” said Anna Yu, an analyst at ICBC
International Research Ltd. in Hong Kong. “While PetroChina
hedged the risks better because of its strong presence in oil
and gas production,  Sinopec (386)  is in a position to deliver as long
as China reforms its pricing mechanism.”  PetroChina rose 3 percent to HK$11.64 at the close in Hong
Kong, the most since Jan. 17, outpacing Sinopec’s 0.1 percent
gain and the 0.3 percent decline in the benchmark  Hang Seng
index. (HSI)  Rival  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  fell 0.1 percent to HK$16.28.  China, which controls fuel prices to curb inflation, raised
them by as much as 11 percent in the first quarter, while Brent
oil rose 12 percent from a year earlier to $118.45 a barrel in
the period. Last year, the government raised prices as much as
7.1 percent while crude gained 13 percent.  Overseas Fields  Overseas fields contributed to higher output at PetroChina,
which plans to spend $60 billion to boost the share of global
assets this decade. Sinopec has  bid  for $9.3 billion in overseas
energy assets in the past year.  Chinese companies have acquired more than $94 billion of
overseas energy assets since January 2009 to secure supplies to
fuel expansion in the fastest-growing major economy. State-
controlled Cnooc is among companies buying energy assets abroad
and developing shale-gas resources at home.  Sinopec’s  profit  fell to 13.4 billion yuan in the three
months ended March 31, from 20.6 billion yuan,  Asia ’s biggest
refiner said yesterday, missing the 18.1 billion-yuan mean
estimate in the Bloomberg survey.  The company’s  refining  loss surged 16-fold to 9.2 billion
yuan from 576 million yuan a year earlier. Sinopec processed
55.4 million tons (393.4 million barrels) of crude, an increase
of 2.1 percent.  Refining Losses  Sinopec attributed the “significant operating loss” from
refining to higher  oil prices , government controls and the need
to increase processing to ensure sufficient fuel supplies. “The
company’s oil refining facilities are currently operating at
full capacity,” Sinopec said in its earnings statement.  PetroChina lost money in the refining business and in the
sale of imported natural gas, areas where prices are capped by
the Chinese government.  PetroChina’s operating loss from refining widened to 10.4
billion yuan from 6.1 billion yuan a year earlier. The company
processed 257.1 million barrels of crude oil in the first
quarter, up 2.8 percent from a year earlier.  The first quarter marks “a solid bottom for both companies
in terms of refining losses,” said Simon Powell, the Hong Kong-
based head of Asian Oil and Gas Research at CLSA Ltd. “The
second quarter and half can only report better numbers as higher
fuel prices kick in and international oil prices have no
momentum to keep moving up.”  Price Reforms  China ’s oil-product prices are adjusted when crude costs
change more than 4 percent over 22 working days. The pricing
cycle may be shortened to 10 days to let fuel prices better
reflect crude price changes, the National Development and Reform
Commission, China’s top planner, said in February.  “If China’s pricing reforms indeed happen this year,
Sinopec will be the biggest beneficiary because of its scale of
economy and the higher efficiency,” CLSA’s Powell said.  PetroChina’s oil and gas output climbed 6.1 percent to
345.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in the first quarter.
Crude oil output reached 227 million barrels, up 3.6 percent,
and the average realized price rose 14.8 percent to $105.48 a
barrel.  Gas Production  Gas production rose 11.2 percent to 710.9 billion cubic
feet, with the average realized price climbing 9.9 percent to
$4.87 per thousand cubic feet.  Overseas production rose 17.1 percent to 31.2 million
barrels of oil equivalent in the first quarter, the company
said.  PetroChina still has “huge” potential to expand its oil
output, Chairman Jiang Jiemin said in a group interview in  Hong
Kong  last month. Overseas oil and gas output will count for 50
percent of PetroChina’s production before 2020, he said.  Production of oil and gas abroad reached 120.8 million
barrels last year, less than a 10th of the total of 1.3 billion
barrels, or 3.5 million barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
