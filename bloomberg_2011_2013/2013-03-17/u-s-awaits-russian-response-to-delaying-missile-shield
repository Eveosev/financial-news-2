The U.S. must issue “reliable,
legally binding” guarantees that plans to expand anti-missile
defenses aren’t directed against Russia, that nation’s Foreign
Ministry said, dismissing the Obama administration’s decision to
slow work on missile defenses in Eastern Europe.  U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said March 15 that the
Pentagon will add 14 land-based missile interceptors in Alaska
in response to threats from  North Korea . To pay for that move
and develop an advanced warhead, he said that about $1 billion
would be shifted from efforts to develop a missile shield in
Poland and Romania.  The Russian response dashed hopes of arms control advocates
that the decision could pave the way to improved U.S.-Russian
relations and revive talks on reducing both countries’ nuclear
arsenals.  The gradual expansion of U.S. defense capabilities is
“destabilizing,” the Moscow-based ministry said in a statement
on its website today. The head of the Russian Parliament’s
foreign affairs committee said yesterday that he wasn’t
impressed by the U.S. moves.  “The American side showed their arguments were false and
far-fetched” pushing for the European system, and the situation
would change fundamentally only if  Russia  were “in the anti-
missile system, not outside it,” Alexei Pushkov said in a phone
interview from Moscow.  Putin has opposed U.S. plans to install a missile shield in
Eastern Europe, and the disagreement has been one impediment to
nuclear arms-reduction talks. While the U.S. has said the
European defenses would be aimed at thwarting attacks from rogue
states such as  Iran , Russia contends it would alter the
strategic balance.  Arms Control  Arms control advocates had said they hoped delaying or even
canceling the long-range interceptor rocket that was to have
been part of a so-called Phased Adaptive Approach to a European
missile shield would help Obama resolve Putin’s concerns.  The move “could help open the door to another round of
U.S.-Russian arms reduction talks,” Tom Collina, the research
director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based
advocacy group, said in a phone interview before today’s
response from Moscow.  Putin’s objection to the missile defense is only one of
many differences he has with Obama’s foreign policy, which also
include American support for rebels who toppled the late Libyan
dictator  Muammar Qaddafi  and those battling Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad, both longtime Soviet and Russian allies and
arms customers.  China’s Comment  Earlier today in Beijing, China criticized efforts to
bolster anti-missile defenses against North Korea, without
mentioning the U.S. specifically.  “Intensifying anti-missile deployment and military
alliances will only intensify antagonism and will not help
resolve the issue,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei
told reporters. “China hopes the relevant parties can move
ahead with regional peace and stability in mind and act
prudently on the anti-missile issue in a responsible manner.”  The U.S.-based system that’s being expanded on the U.S.
West Coast has interceptors built by  Orbital Sciences Corp. (ORB)  of
Dulles,  Virginia , topped by hit-to-kill warheads from  Raytheon
Co. (RTN) , based in Waltham,  Massachusetts .  Boeing Co. (BA) , based in
 Chicago , manages the $34 billion system that now has 26
interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, and four at Vandenberg Air
Force Base in  California . The system hasn’t successfully
intercepted a test target since December 2008.  Staying Ahead  Hagel said the move to bolster the U.S. Ground-Based
Midcourse Missile Defense system was intended to “stay ahead”
of threats posed by North Korea and Iran. North Korea has “no
idea of negotiating with the U.S. unless it rolls back its
hostile policy,” the official  Central News Agency  said over the
weekend.  Shifting some resources from the European system wouldn’t
degrade the U.S. commitment to protecting the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, Hagel said.  The U.S. is installing a missile shield in  Europe  in
phases. It will be based partly on U.S. Navy ships in the
Mediterranean, as well as in Romania and Poland, both former
satellites of the  Soviet Union .  The final phase that would be postponed involves deploying
a faster and bigger rocket. Hagel said the timeline for doing so
has now been delayed until at least 2022.  Under the terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that
took effect in 2011, the U.S. and Russia would be limited to no
more than 1,550 strategic warheads.  Republican Response  While some U.S. Republican lawmakers have been critical of
Democratic President Obama’s efforts to pursue further cuts in
nuclear arms, they initially have supported expanding the
missile shield in Alaska.  Yesterday, Senator  Bob Corker  of  Tennessee , the top
Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed
concern about what he called the “non-deployment” of the
fourth phase of the Europe-based system. Still, he said on the
“Fox News Sunday” program, “most all of us applaud the
efforts to beef up our missile defense on the West Coast.”  For Related News and Information:
