The  Miami Heat  matched the second-
longest winning streak in National Basketball Association
history at 22 games by pulling away for a 108-91 road win over
the Toronto Raptors.  LeBron James had 22 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists
for the Heat, who outscored the Raptors 31-14 over the final 11
minutes yesterday in Toronto to snap a 77-77 tie. Dwyane Wade
added 24 points for Miami and  Ray Allen  scored 16 of his 20
points during the fourth quarter.  Miami improved its NBA-best record to 51-14 and tied the
2007-08 Houston Rockets for the second-best winning streak in
league history. The 1971-72  Los Angeles Lakers  set the all-time
record with 33 consecutive victories.  “It’s a special ride right now that we’re on and I think
the best thing about it is we’re doing it together,” James told
reporters. “We’re doing it for one another and just want to try
to keep it going.”  The Heat have won 10 straight road games during their run,
which dates back to Feb. 3. They next play tonight in Boston
against the Celtics (36-29), who five seasons ago ended the
Rockets’ run of 22 straight wins.  The  New York  Knicks lost on the road by more than 10 points
for the fourth straight time, falling 93-80 yesterday to the Los
Angeles Clippers.  Chris Paul  had 20 points and eight assists to lead the
Clippers (46-21) in the matchup of division leaders. The Knicks
(38-26), who played without the injured Carmelo Anthony,  Tyson Chandler  and Amar’e Stoudemire, remained one game ahead of
Brooklyn in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division as the
Nets lost 105-93 yesterday to the Atlanta Hawks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
