Two men reportedly caught stealing
a rickshaw died of their injuries after being beaten and strung
up from a tree by residents of a small Egyptian Nile Delta town,
the state-run Ahram Gate reported today.  The incident comes days after Egyptian authorities
encouraged civilians to detain suspected criminals as a way to
help police cope with a tide of violence that has swelled in the
two years since former President  Hosni Mubarak â€™s ouster in 2011.
Police have also been striking in parts of the country, calling
for better equipment and benefits.  The two men were caught in the town of Samanood after they
allegedly stole a rickshaw, or tuk-tuk, according to Ahram Gate.
The two were beaten and hung up alive on a tree in the town, and
their captors prevented attempts by others to free them, the
news website reported.  Authorities were delayed in reaching the scene because the
main road was blocked due to a protest over a fuel shortage,
Ahram Gate said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
