Gold jumped to a two-week high,
topping $1,600 an ounce, as concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis
will escalate increased the appeal of the metal as a haven.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities slumped as
much as 1.4 percent, and the euro slid the most in 14 months
against the dollar after European finance ministers proposed a
levy on  bank deposits  in Cyprus as part of a bailout. Gold
climbed to a record $1,923.70 in September 2011, partly because
of Europe’s fiscal woes.  “The Cyprus news spooked the financial markets,” Tim Gardiner, a managing director at TD Securities Inc. in  New York ,
said in a telephone interview. “Gold is getting some safe-haven
bids.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.8 percent to settle
at $1,604.60 at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
metal reached $1,610.40, the highest for a most-active contract
since Feb. 27.  A vote by the Cypriot parliament on the tax was postponed
until tomorrow. European policy makers signaled flexibility on
the application of the unprecedented levy. A poll showed 71
percent of Cypriots said that the government should reject the
plan, and people lined up at cash machines to withdraw funds.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 0.1 percent to $28.874
an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery fell 0.8 percent to $1,579.20 an ounce.  In the spot  market , an ounce of platinum bought as little
as 0.9813 ounce of gold, the lowest since Jan. 14.  Palladium futures for June delivery slumped 1.4 percent to
$764.85 an ounce on the Nymex, the biggest drop since March 1.  To contact the reporters for this story:
