Justin Welby, the new Archbishop of
Canterbury, said he avoids drinking alone after witnessing his
father’s battle with alcoholism, the Sunday Times reported
today, citing an interview.  Welby said he and his wife, Caroline, have an agreement for
her to monitor his alcohol intake. His concerns are fueled by
his belief that “children of alcoholics have a much better
chance themselves of having a dependency problem,” he told the
newspaper.  The Archbishops’s father died in 1977, and he said the
experience of living with an alcoholic parent is “very shaping
as to one’s views of what human beings are like.”  “I very much enjoy a drink,” Welby said. “So Caroline
and I have an agreement that she keeps an eye on me, so she’ll
say if I am going over. But I have rules myself. I don’t drink
alone, things like that.”  Welby, a former oil industry executive, officially took the
Archbishop’s office as the Anglican church’s most senior cleric
on March 21. He will be enthroned during a ceremony in
Canterbury on March 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
