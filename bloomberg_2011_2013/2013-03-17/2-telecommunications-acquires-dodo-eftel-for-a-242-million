M2 Telecommunications Group Ltd. (MTU) , a
Melbourne-based phone company, will buy rivals Dodo Australia
Holdings Pty. and  Eftel Ltd. (EFT)  for A$242 million ($251 million)
using a mixture of cash and new shares.  The company will sell A$84 million of new shares,
equivalent to about 11 percent of its existing market value, and
borrow A$409 million to support the deal, it said in aregulatory
statement today. M2, which last year spent A$192 million buying
 Primus Telecommunications Group Inc. (PTGI) ’s Australian operations,
will refinance A$148 million of Dodo and Eftel debt, it said.  M2 used the Primus acquisition to almost double earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization from a year
earlier, to A$52 million in the six months ended December,
giving it scope for more acquisitions as  Australia  switches over
broadband services to a state-owned wholesale network. Dodo has
400,000 customers, while 130,000 services are operated over
Eftel, according to a company presentation.  “The acquisitions are an excellent complement to our
consumer division,” Geoff Horth, chief executive officer, said
in a statement. “Our business possesses an excellent capability
to grow our share of both the consumer and small to medium
business markets.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will provide a A$400 million loan
facility for the transaction, consisting of a A$315 million
three-year loan and an A$85 million revolving loan and letter of
credit, the company said in a statement. M2’s net debt of A$116
million was  1.41 times  its Ebitda at the end of December,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
