Kevin Streelman got his
breakthrough title on golf’s U.S.  PGA Tour  with a two-shot win
over Boo Weekley at the Tampa Bay Championship.  Streelman, 34, shot 4-under-par 67 in yesterday’s final
round at Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor,  Florida , to finish
with a four-round total of 10-under-par 274. Weekley closed with
an 8-under-par 63, the lowest score of the tournament.  Streelman started his professional golf career after
graduating from  Duke University  in 2001 and said he logged more
than 300,000 miles and burned out three cars playing various
tours across the U.S. before earning his PGA Tour card in 2008.  “It wasn’t too long ago I was in a car driving myself
around dead broke,” Streelman said in a televised interview
before collecting the $990,000 winner’s check in his 153rd PGA
Tour start. “It just shows you -- determination, hard work and
keep chasing your dreams and you never know what will happen.”  Streelman hit rounds of 69, 65 and 67 to recover from an
opening-round 73, the highest first-round score by a winner in a
PGA Tour event since 2010 when Bill Lunde also shot a 73 at the
Turning Stone Championship.  U.S. players have now won the first 12 events of the PGA
Tour season, the longest streak since 1989, when Americans won
the first 13 tournaments.  Next Event  The tour remains in Florida for the Arnold Palmer
Invitational at the Bay Hill Club & Lodge in  Orlando  from March
21-24.  Tiger Woods , the second-ranked player in the  Official
Golf World Ranking , is scheduled to defend the title he won for
a seventh time last year.  Woods’s victory at Bay Hill in 2012 ended a winless streak
on the PGA Tour that stretched back to September 2009. The event
is the last on the PGA Tour schedule that Woods will play before
the  Masters Tournament , which starts April 11.  Woods won the World Golf Championships Cadillac
Championship March 10 to become the only two-time champion on
tour this year. It’s the first time he’s won two PGA Tour events
prior to the Masters since the 2008 season, when he claimed the
last of his 14 major championships at the  U.S. Open .  Woods is also scheduled to play in the Tavistock Cup, an
exhibition event, on March 25 and 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
