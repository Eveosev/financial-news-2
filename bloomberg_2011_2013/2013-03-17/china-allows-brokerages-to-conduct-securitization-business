China  issued rules for brokerages
to convert loans and other assets into securities as regulators
step up efforts to expand firms’ businesses.  Brokerages can now issue securities based on assets such as
corporate receivables, credit assets, and rights to income of
infrastructure facilities, according to  rules  posted on the
website of the China Securities Regulator Commission March 15.  The rules take effect immediately, the securities watchdog
said.  Seeking to boost the sector’s competitiveness,  Guo Shuqing ,
chairman of the securities regulator since October 2011, has
implemented measures such as relaxing restrictions on
brokerages’ expansion and overseas investments and allowing them
to sell mutual funds to the public.  The regulator is seeking feedback on  draft rules  for
brokerages’ stock ownership for employees, it said in a separate
statement on its website March 16. Existing compensation
structures that focus on cash and short-term goals could harm
the sector’s growth, it said.  Last week, the regulator said it would make it easier for
fund managers and brokerages to invest in overseas  capital
markets  as it seeks feedback on revised rules for China’s
Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor program.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
