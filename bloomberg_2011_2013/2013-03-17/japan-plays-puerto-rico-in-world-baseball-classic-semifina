Two-time defending champion Japan
plays  Puerto Rico  and undefeated Dominican Republic faces
Netherlands in the semifinals of the World Baseball Classic.  The Dominican Republic shut out Puerto Rico 2-0 yesterday
to become the only team to enter the semifinals undefeated.  Japan, which won the first two classics in 2006 and 2010,
will meet Puerto Rico today at AT&T Park in San Francisco. The
other semifinal is tomorrow with the championship game on March
19.  In yesterday’s game, Cleveland Indians catcher  Carlos Santana  hit a home run to lead off the fifth and Pittsburgh
Pirates lefthander Wandy Rodriguez pitched six innings of two-
hit ball for the Dominican Republic in its game against Puerto
Rico.  New York  Yankees second baseman  Robinson Cano , playing for
the Dominican Republic, was voted the Most Valuable Player of
Pool 2 after he batted .417 in the three games and hit a home
run in a win over Italy.  “What I wanted was to go to the second round. Once we were
in the second round, we wanted to go to the third round,” Cano
told reporters. “You have to view it game by game. That was not
only important to me, but important to all of our players.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
