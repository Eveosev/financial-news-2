Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark index climbed
to the highest level in more than two weeks as investors bought
banking stocks to take advantage of higher dividends.  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , which recommended a  cash dividend  of
83 fils a share for 2012, rose to the highest level on record.
 Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB)  advanced for the second time in
three days. The  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  gained 0.6 percent to
3,049.60, the strongest close since Feb. 27. Dubai’s  DFM General
Index (DFMGI)  increased 0.1 percent.  United Arab Emirates financial institutions have raised
dividends as they recover from the impact of the global credit
crisis which slowed lending, hit  investment banking , and led to
a surge in loan-loss charges. Abu Dhabi banks offer an average
 dividend yield  of 5.2 percent versus 3.4 percent for the
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Financial Index (BGCCFINL)  of the Gulf Cooperation
Council’s most-traded stocks.  “Investors are switching positions to high-dividend paying
stocks like banks in Abu Dhabi,” said Nabil Farhat, partner at
Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “Earnings prospects are
good for banks this year with potential growth in aggregate
profits of at least five percent.”  Higher Dividend  Middle East and North Africa equities are poised to
outperform  emerging markets  as higher dividends and state-funded
expansion lure investors hunting for better returns, Franklin
Templeton Investment Management Ltd. said in December. The

post the fastest loan growth in the U.A.E. in 2013, EFG-Hermes
Holding SAE said in December. Net income this year may advance 7

assets, said in January it would pay a 25 percent  cash dividend 
for 2012, up from 20 percent a year earlier. The lender’s
fourth-quarter profit rose 19 percent, beating estimates. The
shares, which have surged 33 percent in 2013, gained 0.5 percent
today to 4 dirhams.  Oil Boost  Crude oil for April delivery  climbed 1.6 percent last week
to $93.45 a barrel in  New York . Gulf Arab oil exporters,
including the U.A.E., supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.

North Africa, Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  was little changed.  An International Monetary Fund director is set to meet
today with Egyptian officials amid efforts to advance a stalled
$4.8 billion loan agreement, a day after opponents and backers
of President Mohamed Mursi clashed in Cairo. Egypt’s benchmark
stock index has declined 4.6 percent this year after surging 51
percent in 2012.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  declined 0.5 percent at 3:33 p.m. in
