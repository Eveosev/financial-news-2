France  is exercising “discretion
and determination” to release seven French hostages kidnapped
in northern  Cameroon  a month ago, French Foreign Minister
Laurent Fabius said in Yaounde yesterday.  Fabius arrived in Cameroon on Friday and left yesterday for
Nigeria. The family of seven, including four children from five
to 12 years old, was taken in northern Cameroon by individuals
suspected as members of Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram.  Fabius said he also discussed the situation in Mali with
President Paul Biya. “France will not leave Mali
instantaneously because there is still political work to do:
that of organizing elections, continuing dialog between the
north and south and undertaking economic development,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
