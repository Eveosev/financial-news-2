Latin America and the Caribbean
face weaker economic growth over the next five years as
commodity prices fall and governments struggle with fiscal
deficits, the Inter-American Development Bank said.  Annual growth for Latin America and the Caribbean is
forecast to be 3.9 percent through 2017, down from 4.8 percent
during the five years before the 2007 global recession, the
Washington-based lender said in a report today. Out of 21 major
economies in the region that were reviewed for the study, only
Colombia, Trinidad & Tobago and Belize were in better fiscal
shape than before the financial crisis.  “Weaker fiscal balances are a cause for concern under
current circumstances,” according to the report. “The space
for monetary policy action has shrunk and sustained lower growth
expectations place a limit on what monetary policy can
achieve.”  To revive growth, governments should invest in
infrastructure and bolster domestic savings, the IDB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
