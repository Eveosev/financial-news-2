Mark Teixeira  said he may be unable
to play for the  New York Yankees  before the beginning of June,
two weeks later than the Major League Baseball team’s prior
estimate.  The 32-year-old Teixeira partially tore the tendon sheath
in his right wrist March 5 while practicing with the U.S. squad
for the World Baseball Classic. The Yankees previously said he
strained a tendon.  “If I try to play too early, we could miss the whole
season,” Teixeira told reporters today. “I don’t know if it’s
going to be the middle of May, beginning of May, beginning of
June.”  Teixeira has averaged 32 home runs and 101 runs batted in
since 2010. He batted .251 with 24 homers and 84 RBI last
season, his fourth with the Yankees, who are scheduled to open
their 2013 campaign April 1 against the  Boston Red Sox .  To contact the reporter on this story:
