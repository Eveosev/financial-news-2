The euro weakened against the
dollar and the Swiss franc after euro-area finance ministers
agreed to an unprecedented tax on Cypriot bank deposits as part
of a rescue plan for the country.  Europe â€™s 17-nation shared currency slid 1.1 percent to
$1.2932 at 6:26 p.m. London time. It declined 0.8 percent to
1.2170 Swiss francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
