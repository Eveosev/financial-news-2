Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-
owned company, posted a gain in its proven reserves for a second
year, supported by discoveries in the  Gulf of Mexico  and
onshore.  Mexico ’s reserves rose 0.4 percent to 13.868 billion
barrels as of Jan. 1 from 13.81 billion a year earlier, Mexican
President Enrique Pena Nieto said today on the 75th anniversary
of the state-owned company. Last year, reserves rose 0.1
percent, the first gain in more than a decade.  Pemex made its first two ultra-deepwater crude discoveries
in the Gulf of Mexico and also struck oil in an onshore field in
the Southeastern state of Tabasco last year. Pena Nieto said
Pemex preliminary estimates project that total hydrocarbons
reserves, including probable and possible, climbed to 44.5
billion barrels, the highest since 2006, from 43.8 billion
barrels a year ago.  Probable and possible reserves are unproved reserves that
indicate the relative degree of doubt about their existence,
according to the  Society of Petroleum Engineers  and World
Petroleum Council.  Proved reserves are the only type the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission allows  oil companies  to report to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
