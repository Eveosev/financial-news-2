Even after U.S. stocks  more than
doubled  in the four-year bull market, companies in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index are cheaper than at any record high since
1980 as individual investors shun equities.  The  S&P 500  rose to within 1 percent of its high last week,
gaining 131 percent from its lows. The index trades at  15.4
times reported profit , below the average 19.9 reached in bull
markets since 1962, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  erased all losses from the
financial crisis on March 5 and has added 11 percent this year.  While individuals added almost $20 billion to U.S. stock
funds this year, the amount is just 3.5 percent of the
withdrawals since 2007 and compares with $44 billion placed with
fixed-income managers in 2013, according to the  Investment
Company Institute . For bulls, the absence of private buyers
shows there’s plenty of money to keep the rally going. Bears say
the pessimism means the rally is too dependent on Federal
Reserve stimulus and will fizzle once central bank support ebbs.  “I was down on the floor of the  New York  Stock Exchange
when the Dow hit its new high and there weren’t any champagne
corks popping or people getting excited,”  Michael Holland ,
chairman and founder of New York-based Holland & Co., said in a
March 14 phone interview. His firm oversees more than $4
billion. “Valuations are extremely low. When there’s an absence
of really bad news, the path of least resistance is up.”  Reaching Records  The S&P 500 increased 0.6 percent to 1,560.7  last week ,
bringing the year’s advance to 9.4 percent. The Dow average
climbed to 14,514.11 after reaching a record on eight
consecutive days. Americans  filing for jobless benefits  fell to
the lowest in almost two months, retail sales increased more
than forecast and the housing market strengthened.  The S&P 500 slid 0.7 percent to 1,549.43 at 9:51 a.m. in
New York today as the euro area imposed a levy on Cypriot bank
deposits to reduce the cost of rescuing the nation’s lenders.  About  $10 trillion  has been added to U.S. share values
since the market bottomed on March 9, 2009, during the worst
financial crisis in seven decades. Confidence among households
was shattered by the S&P 500’s 57 percent plunge from its
October 2007 highs.  Institutions have been the main beneficiaries of the rally.
Individuals drained more than $600 billion from equity mutual
funds in the six years though 2012 until becoming net buyers in
January, data from the Washington-based ICI show. Even now,
private investors remain  skittish , withdrawing an estimated $1.7
billion in the two weeks through March 6 and pushing $10.5
billion into bonds.  ‘Big Rotation’  “This big rotation from bonds to equities is not in full
swing,” Alan Zlatar, who helps oversee $65 billion as head of
multi-asset class investments at Vontobel Asset Management in
Zurich, said in a phone interview on March 13. “Our clients are
seeking returns, and so far most of them have tried to stay
within the bond space. What speaks in favor of equities is, of
course, that the alternatives are extremely pricey.”  Stocks are close to the least expensive ever versus
 government bonds , using a valuation method favored by former Fed
Chairman  Alan Greenspan  that compares earnings with interest
payments. S&P 500 companies currently generate profit equal to
6.5 percent of their share prices, about 4.5 percentage points
more than  yields  on 10-year Treasuries. The average spread in
the past 10 years was about 2.5 percentage points, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Declining Volume  The combination of stocks near all-time highs and declining
trading volume indicates money isn’t coming into the market and
that equities are rising because fewer people are selling,
according to Murray Roos, co-head of European equities at
Deutsche Bank AG in  London . On average, 2.53 billion shares
changed hands in S&P 500 companies each day this year, Bloomberg
data show. That compares with 3.59 billion from 2009 to 2012.  “There aren’t sellers, that’s why the equity market is
looking fundamentally cheap,” Roos said. “We’ve got latent
demand for equities. We are at the start of a protracted move up
in equity markets.”  Investors still have reason to be concerned because the
rally has been fueled by unprecedented Fed stimulus, according
to Stewart Richardson at RMG Wealth Management LLP. The central
bank has lowered the target interest rate on overnight loans
between banks to almost zero and is purchasing $85 billion a
month in bonds to boost the economy.  Fed Policy  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s pledge to spur growth helped
stem some of the biggest declines since the bull market began.
The S&P 500 ended a 14 percent drop and began a 30 percent
advance on Aug. 26, 2010, after Bernanke said he “was willing
to do everything in his power” to stimulate growth.  The index has climbed 42 percent since October 2011, the
month after he announced a policy to replace holdings of short-
term Treasuries with longer-term bonds. The S&P 500 had been on
the verge of a  bear market , down 19.4 percent, over the previous
five months.  “The rally has been a direct reflection of Fed policy,”
Richardson, who helps oversee $100 million as chief investment
officer at RMG in London, said in a March 14 phone interview.
“The low volume means investors are not comfortable or  bullish ,
it is just people putting money to work as they don’t want to
hold cash. As soon as the Fed indicates they will stop printing
money, that is a big issue for  capital markets .”  Hedge Funds  While brokerage clients have bought equities this year,
professional investors are liquidating some of their stocks,
data from Bank of America Corp. clients show. Institutional
managers who oversee money for pensions and other benefit
programs sold a net $2.9 billion of shares through the New York-
based bank in 2013 and hedge funds reduced their holdings by
$461 million, according to a report dated March 12.  “The individual investor doesn’t seem like they’ve come
back to the market yet,” Joseph Veranth, chief investment
officer at Dana Investment Advisors in Brookfield,  Wisconsin ,
said by telephone. The firm manages $3.8 billion. “People
aren’t convinced this is for real. They’ve been burned twice in
a big way, and there’s still doubt.”  Valuations in the S&P 500 have stayed below historical
averages after profits almost doubled since 2009. Per-share
earnings are estimated to reach $109.50 this year from $61.84 in
2009, according to more than 11,000 analyst forecasts compiled
by Bloomberg. Today’s multiple of 15.4 times reported earnings
is up from the bull market’s low of 11.7 in September 2011.  Previous Rallies  The price-earnings ratio averaged 18.1 in the five-year
rally through October 2007 and 20.9 during the gains in the
1990s, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While the bull market
that began in 1990 started off with a multiple about 14, it
exceeded 20 within a year. Valuations during the 2002 advance
didn’t fall below the 16.4 historical mean until the cycle’s
fourth year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The only time
stocks were cheaper as the index rallied to a high was in  1980 (SPX) ,
when they traded for 9.1 times profits.  The rise since March 2009 has been  led by  media companies
such as  CBS Corp. (CBS)  and Gannett Co., and industrial firms
including  International Paper Co. (IP)  New York-based CBS, owner of
the most-watched U.S. television network, has jumped more than
15-fold and Gannett, the McLean, Virginia-based company that
publishes 82 U.S. daily newspapers and owns 23 television
stations, has rallied 11-fold. International Paper, the world’s
largest maker of cardboard packaging, has surged 10 times.  Cliffs Natural  Commodities producers  including Cliffs Natural Resources
Inc. in  Cleveland ,  Ohio  and  San Antonio , Texas-based Tesoro
Corp. paced gains in the last bull market, which lasted five
years through October 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Technology stocks such as  Dell Inc. (DELL)  and Cisco Systems Inc. led
the rally that ended in March 2000.  “Those investors choosing not to favor equities in their
strategy in favor of a bond allocation are locking into low
returns,” Ashish Misra, who helps oversee $17 billion as head
of investment policy and research for Lloyds TSB Private Banking
in London, said in a phone interview on March 13. “The economic
growth outlook has not been this universally constructive for a
long time. The wall of worry is very much out there for
investors to climb before markets seek higher levels and more
historically normal ratings.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
