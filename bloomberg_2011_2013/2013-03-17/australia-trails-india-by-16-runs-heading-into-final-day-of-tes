Australia  trails India by 16 runs
heading into the final day of their third cricket Test in Mohali
as the touring team tries to avoid going 3-0 down in the series.  Fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar removed top-order batsmen
David Warner, Ed Cowan and Steve Smith to reduce Australia to
75-3 at stumps after India made 499 to take a 91-run lead on the
first innings.  Phil Hughes  was unbeaten on 53, his highest score
of the best-of-four contest, with Nathan Lyon on 4. Captain
Michael Clarke is yet to bat after suffering back discomfort.  Shikhar Dhawan top scored with 187 in his Test debut for
India, which would regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy by avoiding
defeat. Fellow opener Murali Vijay made 153 and Virat Kohli
struck an unbeaten 67.  Peter Siddle  was Australiaâ€™s best bowler,
taking five wickets for 71.  With three sessions remaining in a match that lost the
entire first day to rain, the draw is the most likely result at
odds of 2-1 on, according to U.K. bookmaker William Hill. That
means a successful $10 bet returns $15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
