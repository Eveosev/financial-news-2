Montrezl Harrell scored 20 points
to rally the University of Louisville to a 78-61 victory over
Syracuse University for the Big East Conference title and a
berth in the national men’s college basketball tournament.  Louisville, down by 16 points in the second half, recovered
last night to win its second straight Big East championship.  “When I got on the floor, I just wanted to help the guys
with a big lift,” Harrell told reporters. “I was going all
over the place, trying to get rebounds, either offense or
defense. I just came out hard and played my heart out.”  The 68 teams and their seedings for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association Tournament that starts March 19 will be
announced today. The NCAA championship game is April 8 at the
Georgia Dome in Atlanta.  In conference championship games yesterday, it was Oregon

Vermont 49 in the America East; Kansas 70, Kansas State 54 in
the Big 12; Montana 67, Weber State 64 in Big Sky; and Memphis
