Dana Air  flights were suspended
after one of its planes had a safety issue with its batteries,
according to the Nigerian Aviation Ministry.  “We did it for a safety precaution,” Joe Obi, a spokesman
for the ministry, said by phone today from the capital, Abuja.
“The flights are suspended, but they still have their
license.”  Dana Air operations resumed in January after one of its
flights from Abuja carrying 146 passengers and seven crew
members crashed last June in a suburb of Lagos, the commercial
capital, killing everyone on board and about 10 people on the
ground. It was  Nigeria ’s deadliest airline crash in almost 40
years. Officials are still probing the crash.  The airline has received notice of the suspension, the
company said on its website. Dana Air wasn’t informed of the
reason for the grounding and will meet with the ministry
officials tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
