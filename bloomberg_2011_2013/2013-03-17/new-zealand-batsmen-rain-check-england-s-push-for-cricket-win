England  and  New Zealand  will enter
the final match of their cricket series tied at 0-0 after the
last day of the second Test in Wellington was abandoned because
of rain.  No play was possible on day five at the Basin Reserve, with
the home team trailing by 49 runs after following on. Only 35
overs were possible yesterday because of rain as the Black Caps,
who were dismissed for 254 in reply to England’s first innings
465 on day three, reached 162-2 in their second innings.  The final Test at Auckland’s  Eden Park  starts in four days.
New Zealand, which has lost eight of its past 13 elite five-day
matches, last won a series against England 14 years ago.  The teams also drew the rain-affected opener in Dunedin as
England held out after trailing by 293 runs on the first
innings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
