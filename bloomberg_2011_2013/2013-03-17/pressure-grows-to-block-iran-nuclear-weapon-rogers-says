Representative Mike Rogers, the
chairman of the House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee,
said “pressure is mounting” for action other than economic
sanctions to stop  Iran  from developing nuclear weapons.  “Everybody agrees that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons
program,” Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said on CNN’s “ State
of the Union ” program today. “The last part of it is, can they
take the highly enriched uranium, weaponize it and put it on a
missile for use? And there’s the debate: How long would it take
to accomplish the last piece of that?”  President  Barack Obama  told an Israeli television station
last week that his administration believes that Iran is at least
a year away from developing a nuclear weapon.  Rogers said he wasn’t as certain as the president on the
timing of when Iran may have the capability to launch a nuclear
strike.  “The Israelis believe it is sooner than that, and that’s
why the pressure is mounting for some action, maybe other than
sanctions for Iran, so they get the signal that we really won’t
tolerate them getting a nuclear weapon and then proliferating
nuclear weapons across the  Middle East ,” Rogers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
