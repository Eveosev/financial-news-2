A third of high-achieving high
school seniors in the bottom fourth of the income scale attend
the most selective U.S. colleges, compared with 78 percent for
the richest kids, the New York Times reported, citing a study.  The analysis by professors Caroline Hoxby of  Stanford
University  and  Harvard University ’s Christopher Avery found the
top public and private colleges failed to recruit an
economically diverse group of students, the newspaper said.  Hoxby and Avery analyzed Scholastic Aptitude Test results
for every high school student in a recent year, and found that
the top schools continue to focus their recruiting efforts in
cities such as Boston, New York and  Los Angeles  with more
talented students who are also poor, the newspaper said.  Students in rural areas and smaller metropolitan areas such
as Bridgeport, Connecticut; Memphis, Tennesee; and Toledo, Ohio
typically don’t apply to selective colleges, the Times said.
Hoxby told the newspaper those students aren’t exposed to people
who are aware of the differences between colleges.  Research has shown that colleges give little or no
advantage to poorer students, compared with those from affluent
backgrounds of the same ethnic background, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
