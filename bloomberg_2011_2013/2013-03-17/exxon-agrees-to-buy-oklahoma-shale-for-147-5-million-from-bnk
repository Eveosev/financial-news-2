Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  agreed to buy
most of the Tishomingo Field assets in  Oklahoma  from  BNK
Petroleum Inc. (BKX)  for $147.5 million, expanding shale exploration
in the state.  Exxon Mobil’s XTO Energy unit will acquire BNK’s Woodford
shale fields in a transaction expected to close in late April,
Camarillo, California-based BNK said today in a statement. BNK
will keep its rights in the Caney and upper Sycamore formations
in the field, the company said in the statement.  Exxon Mobil spokesman  Alan Jeffers  confirmed the sale in an
e-mail statement.  BNK will use the funds from the sale to increase drilling
of wells in the Caney Field and to pursue exploration in Europe
on its own or with partners, the company said in the statement.
The proceeds will also be used to repay a credit facility.  BNK is setting up another drilling rig for its next planned
Caney well and has contracted the rig for two wells with the
option for an additional two wells, the company said.  Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. was the lead
financial adviser to BNK.  To contact the reporter on this story:
