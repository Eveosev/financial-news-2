President  Xi Jinping  told delegates
of the country’s parliament that the ruling Communist Party must
fulfill the “Chinese dream” and share the benefits of economic
growth more equally.  “Chinese people living in our great motherland and this
great era shall share the chance of living a splendid life,
share the chance of realizing the dream, share the chance of
growing and improving along with the motherland,” Xi told the
closing session of the National People’s Congress.  Xi, who replaced  Hu Jintao  as president March 14, vowed to
fight corruption, work to improve ties between the mainland and
Taiwan, and maintain friendly relations with other nations. He
also said that China must be led by the Communist Party and the
military must “listen to the party’s command.”  Xi and newly selected Premier  Li Keqiang  are set to oversee
the world’s second-biggest economy for the next decade. Li is
set to hold a briefing later today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
