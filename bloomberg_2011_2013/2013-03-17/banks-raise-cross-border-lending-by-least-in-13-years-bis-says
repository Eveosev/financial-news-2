Global banks’ cross-border lending
increased at the slowest rate in 13 years in the third quarter,
restrained by a contraction in loans to financial firms in the
euro-area, the  Bank for International Settlements  said.  Lenders reporting to BIS, the record keeper of the world’s
central banks, increased cross-border assets by $33 billion, or
0.1 percent, in the three months through September, according to
data released by the BIS yesterday. Cross-border claims on non-
banks increased by $153 billion, or 1.4 percent, in the period.
Lending to banks fell by $120 billion, or 0.7 percent.  “An expansion of cross-border credit to non-banks,
especially those located in the U.S., was largely offset by a
decline in claims on banks in the euro area,” the BIS said.  Foreign banks are reducing their lending to European banks
on concern that the region’s sovereign debt crisis could be
exacerbated by political uncertainty in  Italy , the area’s third-
largest economy. Banks are also reducing lending as they try to
meet the stricter  capital requirements  set by the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision .  The increase in cross-border claims was concentrated in
those denominated in U.S. dollars, pounds and peripheral
currencies, the Basel, Switzerland-based BIS said. Claims in
euros fell by the most in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
