Israel ’s government bonds gained,
pushing the yield down the most in almost two weeks, on
speculation of an interest-rate cut this month as the country’s
February inflation rate was unchanged.  The yield on the 4.25 percent securities due in March 2023
fell four basis points, the biggest decline since March 4, to
4.01 percent at the close in Tel Aviv.  One-year interest-rate
swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for rates over the
period, dropped four basis points, 0.04 percentage point, on
March 15 to 1.61 percent.  Annual  inflation  remained at 1.5 percent in February, the
statistics bureau said March 15, matching the  median estimate  of
14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The  Bank of Israel , which
kept  interest rates  at 1.75 percent last month, is likely to
lower its base lending rate to 1.5 percent on March 24,
according to nine of 17  analysts  in a Bloomberg survey.  “Inflation remained in the low range supporting
expectations that the central bank will lower interest rates
this month to boost economic growth,” said Avihay Hermon, a
bond trader at  Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT)  in Tel Aviv. “The
market is increasingly pricing in a quarter-point rate-cut.”  Economic growth eased to 3.1 percent in 2012 from 4.6
percent the previous year, the statistics bureau said March 10.
Excluding first-time natural-gas revenue, growth is expected to
shrink further in 2013, according to the central bank.  Inflation Unchanged  Economists’ expectations for 12-month inflation have been
steady at an average 1.9 percent since November, according to a
central bank survey. The government’s target range is 1 percent
to 3 percent. Average annual inflation expectations rose less
than one basis point to 252, according to the two-year break-
even rate, the yield difference between the inflation-linked
bonds and fixed-rate government notes of similar maturity.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, fell 0.1 percent to 283.90.
Local funds raised 68 percent less last week, the weakest week
since December 2012, Meitav Investment House Ltd. said in an e-
mailed report today. Corporate-bond funds pulled in 104 million
shekels compared with 506 million shekels, it said.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday
informed President Shimon Peres he signed coalition deals that
give him the majority to form a new government. The shekel
strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.6832 a dollar on March 15. The
currency has gained 0.8 percent this month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
