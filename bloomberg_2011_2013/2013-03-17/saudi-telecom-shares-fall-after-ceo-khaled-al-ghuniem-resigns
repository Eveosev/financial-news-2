Saudi Telecom Co. (STC)  said Chief
Executive Officer Khaled Al Ghuniem quit after almost nine
months in the post. The shares fell.  Al Ghuniem cited “special circumstances” for his
resignation, the largest Saudi phone company said in a  statement 
to the Saudi bourse without being more specific.  The departure follows last month’s resignation of Jameel Al Molhem, head of local operations, and the exit within the past
year of Ghassan Hasbani, chief of international operations, and
previous CEO Saud Al Daweesh. The company reported a 79 percent
drop in  fourth-quarter  earnings from a year earlier.  The  shares  fell as much as 2.5 percent, the most since Jan.
21, to 39.8 riyals ($10.61), and were at 40 riyals as of 4 p.m.
Riyadh time.  Eleven analysts  have a buy rating on the stock, while three
recommend investors hold the shares, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
