New York  Jets cornerback  Darrelle Revis  earned a $1 million bonus when the New York Jets kept him
on the roster yesterday, ESPN said on its website.  Revis, the subject of trade talks, will receive the money
later in the National Football League season, ESPN said, citing
his contract. He also has a $1 million workout bonus in late
June and a $1 million reporting bonus in late July in his
contract.  The 27-year-old All-Pro selection played only two games
last year before tearing a knee ligament. He has been seeking a
contract worth $16 million annually.  The Jets announced yesterday that they have re-signed
unrestricted free agent kicker  Nick Folk  and signed guard Willie Colon and defensive linebacker Antonio Garay.  Folk joined the Jets as a free agent in 2010 after being
drafted by the  Dallas Cowboys . In 94 games, Folk has converted
134-of-172 field goal attempts and all 242 point-after-touchdown
tries. Last year, he hit 21-of-27 field goals and all 30 PAT
attempts last year.  Colon spent the last seven seasons with the Pittsburgh
Steelers. He has started all 62 games in his career.  Garay, a sixth-round draft pick by the  Cleveland Browns  in
2003, has played the last four seasons for San Diego. Garay has
started 28-of-56 career games, accumulating 164 tackles and nine
sacks. Last year, he had 17 tackles and one sack in eight games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
