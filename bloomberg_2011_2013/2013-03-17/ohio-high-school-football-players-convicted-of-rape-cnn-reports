Two high school football players in
Steubenville,  Ohio , were found guilty of raping a 16-year-old
girl,  CNN reported .  Judge Thomas Lipps today sentenced 17-year-old Trent Mays
to a minimum of two years in a juvenile correctional facility
and 16-year-old Maâ€™lik Richmond to a minimum of one year, CNN
said. The Department of Youth Services will determine whether
the pair will be detained longer, the broadcaster said.  Lipps delivered his ruling after considering four days of
testimony. The judge, rather than a jury, heard the evidence
because the pair were tried as juveniles, CNN said.  Mays also was convicted of disseminating a nude photo of a
minor, for publishing online a photo he took of the victim,  CNN 
said. Mays and Richmond were accused of raping the girl during a
series of end-of-summer parties in August 2012, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
