The  Philippines  will boost domestic
bond sales to the most since at least 2005 next quarter as it
seeks to raise nearly all of its debt requirements locally amid
record-low  interest rates  and a strengthening peso.  The Bureau of the Treasury will increase borrowing via debt
auctions to 150 billion pesos ($3.7 billion) from 120 billion
pesos in the three months through June, Treasurer Rosalia de
Leon said in a memo to dealers today. At each of three monthly
auctions, the government will offer 30 billion pesos of either
three-, five- or seven-year bonds and 20 billion pesos of bills,
according to the memo. Some 25 billion pesos of bonds and 15
billion pesos of bills were sold at the offers this quarter.  The Philippines has informed the central bank it will raise
almost 100 percent of its debt needs locally in 2013, Finance
Secretary Cesar Purisima told reporters today, ending a decade-
long run of global sales. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas cut the
rate on 1.86 trillion pesos of funds in its special-deposit
accounts last week and may limit access to its reverse-
repurchase facility to help manage capital inflows, Monetary
Board Member Felipe Medalla said separately today.  “There might be a movement of funds from the SDA to the
auction,” de Leon said in a March 15 interview. “We’re still
seeing oversubscription in auctions so yields won’t necessarily
go up even if we increase the volume.”  Bonds Decline  The country plans to borrow 730 billion pesos of debt this
year, compared with 717 billion pesos in 2012 that included $1.5
billion of dollar bonds, de Leon said earlier this month. The
150 billion peso target is the biggest since at least 2005,
based on comparable data available on the Treasury’s website.  The yield on the 5.875 percent bonds due January 2018 rose
10 basis points to 3.27 percent, according to midday fixing
prices at Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. The rate is at the
highest level in more than a week. The peso fell 0.3 percent to
40.713 per dollar, according to data from Tullett Prebon Plc. It
remains the best performer among  emerging markets  in the past 12
months, gaining 5.7 percent.  President  Benigno Aquino ’s administration is narrowing the
 budget deficit  as a proportion of GDP, extending debt maturities
and cutting foreign-currency risks in pursuit of an investment-
grade credit rating. The $225 billion economy expanded at the
fastest pace in two years in 2012, surpassing neighbors in
 Southeast Asia , helped by a record-low 3.5 percent benchmark
rate and inflation near the lower end of a 3 percent to 5
percent target range.  Maturities Lengthen  The average maturity of Philippine notes has lengthened to
10.4 years from 6.7 years in 2010 after several bond exchanges,
de Leon said March 15. The ratio of debt to gross domestic
product was 51.4 percent at the end of 2012, compared with 54.7
percent in 2008, she said.  “The additional supply is well within their borrowing
program, and amid benign inflation and ample liquidity,” said
Michael Calleja, treasury head at Manila-based Bank of the
Philippine Islands. “The plan will also support the recent cut
in the SDA as the belly sector can be an alternative destination
for the funds,” he said, referring to securities with
maturities of three to seven years.  The Philippines has the highest junk rating at  Standard &
Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.  The Treasury is studying the sale of inflation-linked bonds
and plans to offer retail notes in the latter part of 2013, de
Leon said. It will continue to repurchase expensive foreign-
currency bonds “if opportunities are present” and doesn’t
discount conducting a debt exchange to further extend maturity,
she said.  ‘Important Pillar’  “Significant progress” has been made in shifting toward a
so-called single-price convention that will add liquidity to the
 bond market  by letting tax-exempt institutions like state-owned
pension funds trade, de Leon said.  The Philippine bond market remains one of the smallest in
the region and was “relatively stagnant” at 37.7 percent of
GDP in 2012, from 36 percent in 2007, she said. That compares
with 75 percent in  Thailand , 85.3 percent in  Singapore  and 106.6
percent in  Malaysia , according to the treasurer.  Average interest on domestic debt has dropped to 6.5
percent from 7.1 percent in 2010, de Leon said.  Treasury bill 
yields fell to all-time lows this quarter, with the 91-day notes
at a record 0.05 percent in February.  “We have our eyes on not only deepening the market but
making sure we are creating the right structure within the
Philippine bond market,” Purisima said today. “The bond market
is an important pillar if we are to build a sustainable
infrastructure for growth of the economy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
