Gianluca Baldassarri, a former
finance chief at  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA , was
released from a Florence jail yesterday, according to his
lawyer.  Baldassarri had appealed his detention because of a
technical violation by the court, his lawyer Filippo Dinacci
said in Siena late yesterday. A judge in Siena is examining a
fresh request by the city’s prosecutors to detain Baldassarri
and questioned the former manager yesterday, Dinacci said.  Police detained Baldassarri in Milan on Feb. 14, accusing
him of obstructing the authorities by hiding a document linked
to Monte Paschi derivative transactions in 2009. Baldassarri,
the only suspect to have been taken into custody during the
probe, was a flight risk, a prosecutor had said.  “Baldassarri didn’t want to flee before and doesn’t want
to flee now,” his lawyer told reporters yesterday.  Monte Paschi’s new management found a document in October
that proved the link between an unprofitable derivative deal
dubbed Alexandria and a new one, which should have led the bank
to book a loss on the original transaction. The bank on March 1
said it filed suits in Florence seeking damages over two
contracts from 2008 and 2009 dubbed Santorini and Alexandria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
