Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. (6808) , China’s
largest hypermarket operator, said profits rose 51 percent last
year as it expanded operations.  Net income jumped to 2.41 billion  yuan  ($388 million) from
1.6 billion yuan in 2011, the company said in a statement to the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange today. This beat the mean estimate of
2.31 billion yuan by five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 14 percent to 77.9 billion yuan.  Sun Art, a venture between Taiwan’s RT-Mart and France’s
Groupe Auchan SA, has gained market share in China’s 507 billion
yuan hypermarket industry even as rivals from  Carrefour SA (CA)  to
 Tesco Plc (TSCO)  have struggled to expand in the world’s second-biggest
economy. The Shanghai-based retailer’s sales are expected to
double between 2012 and 2017, analysts at HSBC Holdings Plc said
in a Feb. 27 report.  The company’s store locations and scale make it best placed
“to benefit from the macro trends like urbanization, an
economic rebound and the rising spending power in second and
third-tier cities,” Hong Kong-based HSBC analysts Lina Yan and
Erwan Rambourg wrote.  The retailer, which operates RT-Mart and Auchan brand
stores in  China , overtook Carrefour in 2007 as the biggest
operator of hypermarkets by tailoring American-style megamarts
to the Chinese consumer.  The Auchan Group had a 13.6 percent market share in 2012
among operators of hypermarkets in China, Euromonitor’s data
showed. This compares with 10.9 percent for Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
and Carrefour’s 6.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
