Premier Li Keqiang said smog
blanketing eastern  China  in recent days gave him a “heavy
heart” and vowed more effort to combat polluted air and water.  ‘This is a problem that has built up over a long period of
time,’’ Li told a briefing after the conclusion of the national
legislature’s annual session today. “This government will show
even greater resolve and take more vigorous efforts to clean up
such pollution.”  The environment shouldn’t be sacrificed for the sake of
growth, Li said. Outside the Great Hall of the People, where Li
spoke, the level of PM2.5, the small particulates that pose the
biggest risk to human health, reached 242 as of 11 a.m. today,
with a 24-hour average of 197, according to Beijing city
government readings. The World Health Organization recommends
24-hour exposure to PM2.5 of no higher than 25.  “In the course of development we will do out best to
ensure people can breathe clean air and have safe drinking water
and food,” Li said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
