Sebastian Vettel secured the pole
position for todayâ€™s season-opening Australian Formula One Grand
Prix in Melbourne ahead of Red Bull teammate  Mark Webber  and
 Lewis Hamilton  of Mercedes.  Vettel, the defending world champion, qualified fastest in
a time of 1 minute, 27.407 seconds around the Albert Park
circuit. The final two qualifying sessions were postponed until
race day because of rain and darkness yesterday.  The race, the first of 19 in the 2013 world championship,
is scheduled to start at 5 p.m. local time.  The 2010 Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka was the last Formula
One race with Sunday qualifying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
