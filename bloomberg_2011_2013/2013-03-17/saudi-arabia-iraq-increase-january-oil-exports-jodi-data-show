Saudi Arabia  and  Iraq  raised crude
oil exports in January for the first time in three months, as
demand from Asian countries climbed, according to the Joint
Organisations Data Initiative.  The Saudi kingdom shipped 7.09 million barrels a day, up
30,000 barrels a day from December, data posted today on the
initiative’s website showed. Exports in January were 5.5 percent
lower than the same month last year, according to JODI.  Iraq, the biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia, increased daily exports
in January by 10,000 barrels to 2.36 million barrels a day, the
data showed.  Saudi Arabia’s stocks of crude oil fell for the third month
in a row, reaching 274.6 million barrels at the end of January,
according to JODI. The country burned 318,000 barrels a day of
crude during the month to generate electricity, down 4.8 percent
from a year ago.  Demand for OPEC crude is estimated to average 29.7 million
barrels a day in 2013, the organization said in its monthly oil
report on March 12. That’s a drop of 400,000 barrels a day from
last year, and a downward adjustment of 100,000 barrels a day
from February’s report, it said. OPEC supplies about 40 percent
of the world’s oil.  India ,  Asia ’s second largest importer of crude after  China ,
increased demand 16 percent to 4.2 million barrels a day in
January, JODI data showed. Singapore, a major trading hub for
Saudi crude, boosted imports 62 percent to 1.04 million barrels
a day, while demand in  Japan  rose 2 percent to 3.8 million
barrels a day, the data showed. China didn’t submit its imports
data for January.  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, uses statistics supplied by national governments to
compile data on imports, exports and output for oil-producing
and consuming nations. The data include crude oil and
condensates and exclude natural-gas liquids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
