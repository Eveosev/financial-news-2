Antonis Samaras, the leader of New
Democracy which garnered the most votes in Greek elections
today,  said the party was the only pillar of stability in
 Greece .  “We are determined to undertake an initiative for a
government of national salvation with two basic pillars: our
remaining in the euro and changes to the economic policies of
the bailout,” Samaras said in comments televised live on state-
run NET TV. “I won’t allow Greece to remain ungoverned.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
