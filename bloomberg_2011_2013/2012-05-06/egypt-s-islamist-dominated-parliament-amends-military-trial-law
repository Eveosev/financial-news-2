     May 6 (Bloomberg) --Egypt’s Islamist-dominated parliament
approved a draft law stripping the country’s president of the
power to refer civilians to military trials, the state-run
Middle East News Agency reported today.  Activists have demanded an end to trying civilians before
military courts. Egypt currently has no president and the first
presidential elections since the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak  will
start on May 23.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
