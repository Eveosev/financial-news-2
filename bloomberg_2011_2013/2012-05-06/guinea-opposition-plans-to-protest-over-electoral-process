Guinea’s two main groups of opposition
parties plan to hold peaceful protests on May 10 in Conakry,
said former Prime Minister Sidya Toure.  “The groups, known as Le Collectif and Alliance pour la
Democratie et le Progres, will protest to demand a transparent
electoral process,” Toure, who leads the Union des Forces
Republicaines party, said yesterday in an interview from
Conakry, the Guinean capital.  “We will organize a caravan inside the country after the
peaceful protests to require our implication in the electoral
process, and the reorganization of the electoral body,” Toure
said. “We will continue demonstrations as long as we have no
elections management system compatible with the Guinean
electoral law.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Ougna Camara in Conakry
