Returning Australia’s budget to
surplus is the best defense against an uncertain global economic
outlook and will continue to support the nation’s top credit
ratings, Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said.  Australia’s economy is forecast to return to its trend
growth over the next couple of years with a strong outlook for
mining investment, Swan said in his weekly economic note today.  “Against the uncertain international backdrop, Australia’s
fiscal discipline sends a strong message of confidence to the
world, demonstrated in our AAA credit rating from all three
major international ratings agencies, something never before
achieved in our nation’s history,” Swan said.  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  is set to unveil on May 8 a
budget that seeks to end four years of deficits as support for
her government has fallen to near-record lows in opinion polls.
The budget comes as the  Reserve Bank  of Australia cut growth and
inflation forecasts this week on slowing inflation after
slashing its key rate by half a percentage point to a two-year
low.  Australia escaped recession during the global financial
crisis and is still doing “far better” than most other
economies, Finance Minister  Penny Wong  said today. Mining
investment in Australia, the world’s biggest exporter of iron
ore and coal, is estimated to reach A$120 billion ($122 billion)
in the next fiscal year, an increase of around 155 percent in
two years, Swan said in March. The nation is rated Aaa by
Moody’s Investors Service and AAA by  Fitch Ratings , both with
stable outlooks.  Gillard said today returning the budget to surplus will
create “a buffer” if the global economy worsens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
