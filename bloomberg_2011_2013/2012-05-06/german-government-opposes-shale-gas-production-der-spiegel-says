German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler and Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen agreed to
currently oppose shale gas production in the country,  Der
Spiegel  reported, citing unidentified government officials.  There are several issues that need to be examined with the
technique of hydraulic fracturing, Roesler told people close to
him, the Hamburg-based news magazine said in an e-mailed summary
of an article.  The technique known as fracking involves forcing chemically
treated water and sand underground to break rock and let trapped
gas flow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
