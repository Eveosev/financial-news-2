Egypt  will offer 4 billion Egyptian
pounds ($662 million) of three- and  nine-month treasury bills  as
Saudi Arabia said it would this month start “implementing” an
aid package agreed on almost a year ago.  The average yield on the three-month securities rose three
basis points to 13.938 percent and nine basis points to 15.616
percent on the longer notes at the last sales, according to
central bank data on Bloomberg. The North African country will
seek bids for 1 billion pounds in the shorter-term notes and 3
billion pounds in nine-month bills.  Saudi Arabian aid, part of a package of about $4 billion
announced in July 2011, is being discussed by officials from
both countries and will be implemented in the “coming few
days,” the kingdom’s ambassador to Cairo Ahmed Qattan said on
Al Arabiya television May 3. Qattan returned to Cairo yesterday
after he was recalled more than a week ago following protests
outside  Saudi Arabia ’s embassy after the arrest of an Egyptian
human rights activist in the kingdom.  Egypt’s foreign currency reserves, which have fallen for
the last 15 months to the lowest level in more than seven years,
were expected to show improvement in April or May on the
expectation that Saudi aid will arrive, Finance Minister Momtaz
el-Saieed said last month. Reserves fell to $15.1 billion in
March, enough to cover 3.1 months of imports, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on official data. That’s down from
8.7 months in December 2010.  The yield on the Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 retreated three basis points, or 0.03 of a percentage
point, to 6.89 percent on May 4, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level in three weeks. The Egyptian
pound, subject to a managed float, strengthened less than 0.1
percent to 6.0438 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
