Qatar, an OPEC producer, may raise the
base oil price in its 2012-2013 budget for the first time in
three years.  The country’s  finance ministry  proposed that the budget be
based on an oil price of $65 a barrel, Finance Minister Yousef Hussain Kamal told reporters at a conference in the country’s
capital Doha today. Qatar based its 2011-2012 and 2010-2011
budgets on an oil price of $55 a barrel, the state-run Qatar
News Agency  reported in March  last year, citing the finance
ministry.  The budget will be “much bigger” than the previous one
and may be announced this month, Kamal said in Doha today.
Inflation will average 2 percent to 3 percent this year, he
said.  Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural
gas, relied on oil and gas for 58.3 percent of its nominal gross
domestic product in 2011, according to the country’s economic
planning board. Crude  oil prices  have risen 32 percent in  London 
since May 2010.  The country had the world’s fastest economic growth for the
past two years, according to International Monetary Fund data,
amid rising oil prices and increased gas exports.  Qatar’s fiscal-year budget is typically released by early
April and remains in effect until the following March. The
finance ministry delayed release of the new budget until as late
as June this year because of accounting changes.  Qatar’s 2011-2012 budget, released March 31, 2011, included
a projected surplus of 22.3 billion riyals ($6.1 billion) and a
19 percent increase in spending from the previous fiscal year,
Qatar News Agency reported in March last year, without giving
the size of the budget. The 2010-2011 budget set spending at
117.9 billion riyals and included a 10 billion-riyal surplus.  Qatar raised its annual capacity to produce liquefied
natural gas to 77 million tons last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
