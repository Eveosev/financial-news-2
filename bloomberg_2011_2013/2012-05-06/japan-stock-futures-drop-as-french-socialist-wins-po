Japanese and Australian stock futures
fell amid growing concern over Europe’s debt crisis after
Socialist Francois Hollande was elected president of France and
Greek voters flocked to anti-bailout parties.  American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a
carmaker that gets almost 80 percent of its revenue overseas,
sank 3.4 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of
 Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that depends on Europe for almost a
third of its sales, lost 2.2 percent after the euro fell against
the yen, cutting the exporter’s earnings outlook. ADRs of  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, slid 1.7
percent after prices for oil and metals slipped.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,150 in Chicago on May 4, down from 9,220 in
Singapore. Japanese markets were closed on May 3 and 4 for
national holidays. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,140 in
 Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index lost 1.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
fell 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “There’s concern that the European debt problem may get
serious. The euro is being sold in the  currency market  and
that’s negative for Japanese stocks,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama,
a market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “In the U.S., the
job recovery is getting sluggish, fueling concern that may have
a bad impact on  consumer spending  and housing markets.”  U.S. Employment  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell 1.1 percent
today. The index sank 1.6 percent in  New York  on May 4 after a
report showed payrolls climbed 115,000 in April, the smallest
gain in six months and below economists’ estimates for a 160,000
advance. The jobless rate unexpectedly fell to a three-year low
of 8.1 percent as people left the  labor force . Concern about
Europe’s debt crisis also pushed stocks lower as services and
manufacturing output in the euro region shrank.  The euro fell to its lowest level against the yen in almost
three months low as Socialist Hollande was elected president and
Greek voters flocked to anti-bailout parties, stoking concern
austerity efforts in Europe may be derailed.  The euro weakened to as low as 103.24 yen today in Tokyo,
compared with 106.20 yen at the close of  stock trading  on May 2.
The dollar also depreciated to 79.67 yen from 80.37 yen, cutting
the value of some overseas income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  Crude Below $100  Oil fell below $100 a barrel for the first time since
February. Crude oil for June delivery sank 4 percent to $98.49 a
barrel in New York on May 4, the lowest settlement since Feb. 7.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 0.4 percent
on May 4. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials slipped 1.4 percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 9 percent this year
through May 4, compared with an 8.9 percent advance by the  S&P
500  and a 3.5 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 1.3 times book
value, compared with 2.2 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for
the Stoxx 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A number
below 1 means companies can be bought for less than value of
their assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
