U.K. banks may face an investigation
by the Financial Services Authority into the alleged mis-selling
of interest rate swaps to small businesses, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, citing an unidentified spokesman for the regulator.  The FSA completed an initial investigation last week and
ordered the banks to provide more information before a decision
likely to be made in June, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
