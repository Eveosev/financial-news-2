DigitalGlobe Inc. (DGI)  shares fell 8.4
percent after the satellite-imagery company rejected an
unsolicited offer from  GeoEye Inc. (GEOY)  for about $792 million,
saying the bid “substantially undervalues” its business.  DigitalGlobe said yesterday that the offer wasn’t in the
best interests of its shareholders and didn’t recognize the
company’s financial and operating record and prospects.  GeoEye offered to buy Longmont, Colorado-based DigitalGlobe
last week, a deal that would create the world’s largest
commercial-imagery satellite company and help cope with U.S.
defense budget cuts. GeoEye proposed $8.50 in cash and 0.3537 of
a GeoEye share for each DigitalGlobe share.  Digital Globe fell to $15.06 at the close in  New York 
today, while GeoEye’s stock dropped 5.2 percent to $23.54.  GeoEye’s bid was 26 percent higher than DigitalGlobe’s
closing value on May 3,  sending  the stock up 22 percent the next
day. GeoEye Chief Executive Officer Matt O’Connell said the
company could be flexible about the mix of cash and stock
involved in the offer.  While rejecting the bid, DigitalGlobe disclosed that GeoEye
had in the past turned down bids to be acquired by DigitalGlobe.  DigitalGlobe said it had made an all-stock offer on March 2
that would have given GeoEye holders about 40 percent of a
combined company. The offer was repeated on April 13, according
to DigitalGlobe, which said the overture was rejected both
times. The size of the bids wasn’t made public.  Beginning in February  GeoEye started making proposals to DigitalGlobe in
February, DigitalGlobe said yesterday.  The company also said in the statement that its three
satellites enable it to offer more imagery to the National
Geospatial Intelligence Agency than GeoEye, and that its first-
quarter revenue growth of 12 percent surpassed that of Virginia-
based GeoEye.  President  Barack Obama  asked Congress for $71.8 billion in
spending for intelligence agencies, according to the Defense
Department and the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence. That’s about $6.8 billion less than funding in
2011.  To contact the reporter on for this story:
