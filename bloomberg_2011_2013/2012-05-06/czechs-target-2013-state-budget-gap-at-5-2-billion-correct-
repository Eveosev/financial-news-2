(Corrects figure in headline.)  The Czech government targets a 2013
central state budget deficit of 100 billion koruna ($5.2
billion) if lawmakers approve proposed spending cuts and
austerity measures, Czech Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek
said today on Czech state television channel  CT24 .  The government targets the shortfall of the broader public
finances, in which the central budget is the biggest part, at
2.9 percent of economic output in 2013, Kalousek reiterated
during a TV interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
