Mike Green fired a 49-foot slapshot
with five minutes to play to give the Washington Capitals a 3-2
victory over the  New York Rangers  in the second round of the
National Hockey League playoffs.  The Capitals tied the best-of-seven series 2-2 with the
top-seeded Rangers.  Washington’s Alex Ovechkin scored his fourth goal of the
playoffs midway through the first period last night at the
Verizon Center in Washington. Artem Anisimov tied the game 70
seconds into the second period.  The Capitals reclaimed the lead on Nicklas Backstrom’s goal
at 11:54 into the second period before Marian Gaborik evened the
score at 2-2 five minutes later.  “Everything is just so tight,” New York’s Ryan Callahan
told reporters. “You never know which play is going to win the
game for you.”  The Capitals travel to  New York  for Game 5 tomorrow.  Today, the Los Angeles Kings can sweep the  St. Louis Blues 
and advance to the Western Conference finals on home ice, while
the New Jersey Devils will try to take a 3-1 advantage with a
victory over the  Philadelphia Flyers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
