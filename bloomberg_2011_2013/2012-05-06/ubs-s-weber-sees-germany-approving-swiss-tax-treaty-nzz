Germany’s upper house will ratify a
tax treaty with Switzerland,  UBS AG (UBSN)  Chairman Axel Weber told
Swiss newspaper  NZZ am Sonntag  in an interview published today.  Germany and Switzerland last month signed an amended tax
treaty including a withholding tax to end a decades-long dispute
over tax evasion. The accord still needs approval by Germany’s
upper house, where Social Democrats and Greens have voiced
opposition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
