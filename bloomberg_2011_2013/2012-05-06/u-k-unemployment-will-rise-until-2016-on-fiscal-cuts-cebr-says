U.K. unemployment will rise over the
next five years almost everywhere in the country as the deepest
government spending squeeze since World War II bites, the Centre
for Economic and Business Research said.  Joblessness in the North East will increase to 13 percent
in 2016 from 12 percent in 2012, while the rate in  Northern
Ireland  will climb to 10.7 percent from 8.8 percent, the group
said in a statement in  London  today. The regions have a large
proportion of public-sector workers, which is weighing on the
employment outlook there, the CEBR said.  Unemployment in London, now at 10.3 percent, will rise to
10.7 percent next year and stay there until 2016.  “Five more years of pain are expected for much of the
U.K.,” Rob Harbron, economist at the CEBR, said in the
statement. “The outlook is tough for U.K. households,
particularly those in places with a high dependency on public-
sector employment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
