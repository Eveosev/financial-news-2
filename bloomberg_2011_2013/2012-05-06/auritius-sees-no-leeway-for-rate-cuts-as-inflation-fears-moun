Mauritius won’t have “leeway” to cut
 interest rates  further if fuel and food prices rise, said
Rundheersing Bheenick, central bank chief of the Indian Ocean
island nation.  Fuel and food prices are “uncertainty factors,” Bheenick
said in an interview published today in the Port Louis-based
l’Express Dimanche newspaper. “Inflation can be back on the
rise. So interest rates probably won’t fall further, we will
have no leeway.”  The Bank of Mauritius has reduced its benchmark rate twice
since December, to 4.9 percent, in a bid to prod spending and
boost economic growth, including a half-point cut in March that
was the biggest since September 2010.  So far, though, the cuts haven’t had an impact on
investment, Bheenick said. “I think there won’t be any.”  Statistics Mauritius lowered its growth forecast on March
30 to 3.6 percent from 4 percent on slowing tourism and textile
demand from  Europe , the country’s main source of revenue.
Annual inflation slowed to 3.8 percent in March, the lowest
since October 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
