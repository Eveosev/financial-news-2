Royal KPN NV (KPN) â€™s German E-Plus division
wants to sell thousands of cell towers in the country to a
financial investor to fund the expansion of its network, Der
Spiegel reported, without saying where it got the information.  The company held initial talks with potential buyers in
recent weeks and would lease the towers back after a sale, the
