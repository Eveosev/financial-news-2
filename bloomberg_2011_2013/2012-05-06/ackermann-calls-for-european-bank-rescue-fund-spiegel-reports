Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chief Executive
Officer Josef Ackermann said he supports the creation of a
European bank rescue fund,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing an
interview.  Such a vehicle is needed now more than ever to stabilize
banking systems, restructure international lenders if necessary
and avoid the distortion of competition, the Hamburg-based
magazine cited the CEO as saying.  Ackermann said the “re-nationalization” of European
banking markets is a matter of concern, Spiegel reported in an
e-mailed summary of an article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
