Algeria will be able to meet domestic
gasoil demand by 2014 after refinery upgrades slated to increase
output by an additional 4 million metric tons, Energy Minister
Youcef Yousfi said.  As well as aging refineries, the country is also grappling
with insufficient fuel storage capacity, Yousfi said. “In some
parts of the country, our capacity is limited to a few days of
consumption,” he said in an interview on state radio. The
government had earmarked 200 billion dinars ($2.69 billion) to
help state-run oil firm Sonatrach boost storage to the
equivalent of one month of consumption by 2020, he said.  Domestic fuel demand increased by almost 9 percent in 2011
compared with the previous year, largely due to an increase in
the number of vehicles, he said.  Oil exports in the first quarter of 2012 amounted to $20
billion, Yousfi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
