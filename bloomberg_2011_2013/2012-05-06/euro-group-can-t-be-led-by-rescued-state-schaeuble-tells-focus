German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the next head of the European Union’s euro group
probably won’t come from a state that received a bailout,  Focus 
reported.  Still, Portuguese Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar would be a
good candidate to replace the current head of the group,
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , the German
magazine cited Schaeuble as saying in an e-mailed summary of an
article.  Schaeuble said in an interview that heading the euro group
himself “is not my dream but it wouldn’t be a nightmare,”
according to Focus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
