German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  wants to create an independent committee to oversee
budget discipline at the state and federal levels,  Der Spiegel 
reported, citing a document drafted by the ministry.  The committee would advise the stability council, where the
state and federal governments agree on fiscal policy, and be
composed of Bundesbank representatives, scientists and other
officials, the Hamburg-based magazine reported.  The plans would implement rules agreed to under Europeâ€™s
fiscal pact on budget consolidation, Spiegel said in an e-mailed
summary of an article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
