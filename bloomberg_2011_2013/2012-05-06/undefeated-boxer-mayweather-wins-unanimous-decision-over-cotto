Floyd Mayweather Jr. won a unanimous
decision as he challenged for the 154-pound title owned by his
opponent Miguel Cotto.  Mayweather, undefeated in 43 fights, added the World Boxing
Association super welterweight belt to his list of
accomplishments after the 12-round bout. Cotto, who drew blood
when he connected with Mayweather’s nose, fell to 37-3 at the
MGM Grand arena in  Las Vegas .  “You’re a hell of a champion,” Mayweather told Cotto
after the fight. “You’re the toughest guy I ever fought.”  Mayweather was guaranteed a record $32 million for the
fight, while Cotto earned $8 million. Each fighter got a share
of the pay-per-view receipts.  Mayweather landed 179 of 687 punches compared with 105 of
506 by Cotto.  “He’s a tough competitor,” Mayweather said. “He came to
fight, he didn’t just come to survive. I dug down and fought him
back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
