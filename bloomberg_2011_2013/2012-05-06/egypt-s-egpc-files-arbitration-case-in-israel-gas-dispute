Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. and
Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co. filed a request for arbitration
against East Mediterranean Gas Co. over a deal to supply natural
gas to  Israel , EGPC’s chairman said.  The two state-run companies filed the request on May 3
after East Mediterranean, or EMG, breached the terms of the
contract by delaying payments for gas, which it exports to
Israel, Hani Dahi said in an interview today in Cairo.  EGPC and EGAS last month notified EMG, in which Ampal-
American Israel Corp. owns a 12.5 percent stake, of the
termination of the contract. Ampal and other investors in EMG on
May 3 said they had filed an arbitration request against  Egypt 
over the contract’s termination.  EMG hasn’t received any notification that it will enter
arbitration, according to an EMG official who asked to remain
anonymous in line with company policy.    To contact the reporter on this story:
