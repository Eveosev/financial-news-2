Dubai shares fell for an eighth day,
the longest losing streak since 2006, after U.S. job data fueled
concern the global economy is weakening and on speculation
political instability in Iran may intensify.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, decreased 1.9 percent.  Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC) , whose
portfolio includes more than 40 companies, fell to the lowest
level in more than two months. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  retreated
1.4 percent to 1,560.28, the lowest since Feb. 16, at the 2 p.m.
close in Dubai. The gauge has declined 6.6 percent in the past
eight days, trimming a rally for the year to 15 percent.
Egyptian stocks advanced for a second day.  “Investment sentiment is negative following weak
employment and economic numbers from the U.S. over the
weekend,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al
Fajer Securities. “There is also worry about the political
turmoil with Iran.”  U.S. stocks slumped, sending the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  down 2.4 percent in its biggest weekly retreat this year,
after U.S. employers added fewer jobs than forecast, the
American service sector slowed and euro-region unemployment rose
to a 15-year high. The  STOXX Europe 600 (SXXP)  declined 2.4 percent in
the period.  Shares Decline  Iranians voted in a second round of elections on May 4 as
the country grappled with a surge in prices following tightening
international sanctions in the past six months due to the its
nuclear program. The economic strains have opened rifts within
the Iranian leadership.  Israel has threatened to use force and the European Union
and the U.S. have imposed curbs on oil to deter Iran from
obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran, the second-biggest producer in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, insists its
nuclear program is peaceful and says evidence being used against
it has been forged.  Crude for June delivery fell 6.1 percent to $98.49 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange last week, oil’s first
retreat below $100 a barrel since February. Gulf Arab oil
exporters, including the United Arab Emirates and  Saudi Arabia ,
supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Emaar fell to 3.05 dirhams, the lowest close since March
29. Dubai Investments slumped 3.5 percent to 74.9 fils, the
lowest since Feb. 20.  In North Africa, Egypt’s  EGX30 Index (EGX30)  rose to the highest
since March, gaining 0.9 percent to 4,973.62, after EFG-Hermes
Holding SAE and Qatar’s QInvest LLC said they plan to create an
investment bank.  EFG-Hermes Suspended  Cairo-based EFG-Hermes, the biggest publicly traded Arab
investment bank, said May 4 it agreed with QInvest to start the
venture that will be 60-percent owned by the Qatari firm.
QInvest, a unit of  Qatar Islamic Bank (QIBK) , will invest $250 million.  EFG-Hermes shares were suspended by the bourse pending the
release of more information. The Egyptian Exchange also canceled
all May 3 trades in the stock, without giving a reason. The
shares are up 31 percent this year, compared with a 37-percent
increase for the benchmark index.  Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  and Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  fell
0.3 percent. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) 
decreased 1 percent and Kuwait’s  gauge  retreated 0.1 percent,
while Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  rose 0.2 percent and Bahrain’s  gauge 
climbed 0.3 percent.  In Israel, the  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  tumbled 1.8 percent in Tel Aviv.
The yield on the country’s 5.5 percent notes due January 2022
declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.57
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
