Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  may make its
Germanwings low-cost carrier responsible for long-haul flights
out of Dusseldorf as part of a merger with other short-haul
services,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing a presentation of a
possible business plan made to employee representatives.  Lufthansa may also allow the merged unit to source ground
services from external providers as part of the measures
designed to make it profitable by 2015, the news magazine
reported in an e-mailed summary of an article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
