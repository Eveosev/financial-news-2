     May 6 (Bloomberg)-- People believed to be members of a
militant Nigerian Islamic sect yesterday killed four people and
wounded 10, including two soldiers, in two attacks in Maiduguri,
capital of the northeastern state of Borno, a military official
said.  A trader was shot dead in the town’s Gamboru Market, while
four women and two girls were injured in a bomb blast near the
market yesterday, Lieutenant-Colonel Sagir Musa, spokesman for
the Joint Task Force in Borno, said by phone today from
Maiduguri.  In another attack, three were killed and four, including
two soldiers, were wounded at a wedding ceremony in the town,
Musa said.  Nigerian authorities blame Boko Haram, a militant Islamic
group, for a spate of violence since last year targeting
government buildings and security forces. The group claimed
responsibility for blasts that struck eight government buildings
in Kano on Jan. 20, killing at least 165.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer, is split between a
mainly Muslim north and predominantly Christian south. More than
14,000 people died in ethnic and religious clashes in the West
African nation between 1999 and 2009, according to the Brussels-
based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
