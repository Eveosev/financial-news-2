Alexis Tsipras, the head of Syriza,
which elections today showed could be  Greece ’s second-biggest
party, said the Greek people had given him a mandate to do
whatever he can to cancel the bailout agreement with the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund .  The result today shows that Greeks, and Europeans, want
“to cancel the memorandum of barbarity,” Tsipras said in
statements televised in Athens on state-run NET TV. He said he
would begin talks with parties of the Greek left tomorrow to
achieve that goal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
