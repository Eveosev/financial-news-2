Australian corporate bond risk rose
the most in more than six weeks as French Socialist Francois
Hollande was elected President and Greek voters flocked to anti-
bailout parties, stoking concern austerity efforts in  Europe  may
be derailed.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index surged 7 basis points to
165 basis points as of 8:32 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG.  Thatâ€™s set for the biggest daily increase since March 22 and 
the highest close since Jan. 18, according to data provider CMA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
