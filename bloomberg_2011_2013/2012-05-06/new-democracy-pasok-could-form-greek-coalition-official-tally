Antonis Samarasâ€™s  New Democracy  party
led in Greek elections today, falling short of the outright
majority he sought to govern alone, official projections showed.  New Democracy won 19.2 percent of the vote and gained 109
seats in the 300-seat legislature, according to official
projections from the Interior Ministry based on partially
counted returns. Anti-bailout party Syriza gained 16.3 percent
and 50 seats, while socialist Pasok, with 13.6 percent, gained
42 seats.  On the basis of the initial figures, New Democracy and
Pasok, who have both supported imposing austerity measures in
return for bailout funds from the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund , would gain a majority of 151 in the
300-seat parliament if they chose to form a coalition.  Anti-immigrant party  Golden Dawn  received 7 percent of the
vote and will have 22 seats, according to the projections.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
