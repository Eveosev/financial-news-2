Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Chairman
 Warren Buffett  said he stepped away from a potential acquisition
for about $22 billion because of the price.  “I just couldn’t make the deal,” Buffett said in an
interview yesterday with Betty Liu on Bloomberg Television’s “In
the Loop” after Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha,  Nebraska .
“We couldn’t come to an agreement.”  Buffett is seeking acquisitions to improve returns on a
cash pile that climbed to  $37.8 billion  as of March 31. The
billionaire has maintained the cash level at more than $20
billion to guarantee liquidity and told investors earlier
yesterday that the potential deal would have required Berkshire
to sell  securities  he would prefer to keep.  Buffett didn’t immediately return a message today seeking
comment about yesterday’s remarks or the identity of the
potential target company.  “If we can make a good deal tomorrow, whether it’s big or
small, we’ll make it,” Buffett said in the interview.  Berkshire acquired Lubrizol Corp., an additives maker, for
about $9 billion last year and paid $26.5 billion in 2010 for
the 77.5 percent of railroad Burlington Northern  Santa Fe  it
didn’t already own. The CTB Inc. farm-products subsidiary said
May 4 it agreed to buy Meyn Holding BV of the Netherlands to
expand into  slaughtering  and packaging equipment for chickens.
