The Spanish government plans to issue
about 30 billion euros ($39 billion) of so-called hispabonds to
help regions of the country pay debt maturities and finance the
deficit,  El Mundo  reported today, without citing anyone.  The sale of hispabonds, which would allow regions to issue
debt jointly, is scheduled to start in June and is being
designed by the economy ministry, the newspaper said.  More than half of the bond sale will be for Catalonia and
Valencia, which have more than 16 billion euros of debt maturing
this year, El Mundo said, adding that other regions facing big
financial trouble include Castilla La Mancha, Murcia and
Andalucia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
