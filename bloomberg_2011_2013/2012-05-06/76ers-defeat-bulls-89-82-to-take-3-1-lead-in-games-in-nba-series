The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the
 Chicago  Bulls 89-82 to lead their National Basketball
Association playoff series by three games to one.  Spencer Hawes scored a team-high 22 points for the 76ers at
Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia in Game 4 of the best-of-
seven series. The teams return to Chicago for Game 5 on May 8.  “It’s going to be huge,” Hawes said in a televised
interview. “We’re going back to Chicago, they’re going to be
ready, their crowd’s going to be ready.”  The Bulls, who finished the regular season tied with the San
Antonio Spurs for the best record in the league, won the series
opener, in which league Most Valuable Player  Derrick Rose 
suffered a season-ending knee injury. Chicago has since lost
three in a row to Philadelphia.  The 76ers, who haven’t won a playoff series since 2003, are
looking to become the fifth No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed in
the NBA playoffs.  Also today, the  New York  Knicks will seek to avoid being
swept by the Miami Heat. A fourth straight defeat for New York
would take its winless streak in the playoffs to a record-
extending 14 games dating back to April 2001.  The Boston Celtics can take a 3-1 lead in games with a home
win against the Atlanta Hawks. The  Los Angeles Lakers  can also
move within one win of the second round with a victory in Game 4
of their series at the  Denver Nuggets .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
