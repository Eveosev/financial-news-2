The U.K. must not delay building a new
high-speed rail network, the British Chambers of Commerce said,
responding to a report that the government will postpone plans
for a link between London and Birmingham.  The  Sunday Telegraph  said today that a bill paving the way
for the so-called HS2 line costing 32 billion pounds ($51.7
billion) will be dropped from the Queen’s speech next week,
delaying the start of the project by at least a year to 2027.  “Given the importance of infrastructure to our future
competitiveness, business fears the signal being sent at reports
that the bill enabling the construction of HS2 might be dropped
from the Queen’s Speech,” Adam Marshall, director of policy at
the BCC, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Plans for the new rail link have met opposition from those
who argue it will blight some of  England ’s most picturesque
countryside. The line also passes through the constituencies of
five Conservative Party ministers, one of whom, Cheryl Gillan,
may resign, The Sunday Telegraph said.  A “hybrid” bill is required to develop large national
transportation projects. Delaying the legislation will defer an
expected parliamentary struggle.  The country’s railways are almost at capacity, roads need
investment and there’s no clear aviation strategy, the statement
said. “These facts must be addressed no matter how
uncomfortable they may make ministers,” the BCC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
