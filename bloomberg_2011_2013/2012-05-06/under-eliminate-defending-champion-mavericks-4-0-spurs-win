James Harden  scored 29 points to help
the Oklahoma City Thunder win 103-97, sweeping the defending
National Basketball Association champion Dallas Mavericks in the
first round of the playoffs.  The  Miami Heat  were the last defending champion to lose 4-0
in the first round, to the Chicago Bulls in 2007.  “They just had more weapons than us,” Mavericks forward
Dirk Nowitzki told reporters. “They looked really good all the
way around.”  In other games last night, the San Antonio Spurs defeated
the Utah Jazz 102-90 to move within one victory of a sweep, the
Indiana Pacers topped the Orlando Magic 101-99 in overtime to
take a 3-1 lead in their best-of-seven series and the  Los
Angeles  Clippers beat the Memphis Grizzlies 87-86 to hold a 2-1
advantage.  At EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City, Tony Parker
scored 27 points and Tim Duncan added 17 as the Spurs took a 3-0
lead over the Jazz. Al Jefferson had 21 points and 11 rebounds
and Devin Harris added 21 points for the Jazz, who host Game 4
tomorrow. No NBA has ever come back from down 3-0 to win a best-
of-seven series.  Thunder Rally  At American Airlines Center in Dallas, Harden came off the
bench in the fourth quarter to score seven consecutive baskets
and nine points in a 12-0 run for the Thunder, who were down 13
points with just under 10 minutes left.  Serge Ibaka tallied two points on Russell Westbrook’s steal
and the Thunder took the lead 92-91 with five minutes, 17
seconds remaining.  Kevin Durant  added 24 points for the Thunder, who were tied
with the Mavericks 47-47 at halftime.  “They just outplayed us tonight,” Dallas guard Delonte
West said. “They got three really good players in Durant,
Westbrook and Harden. They attacked us tremendously and that was
our downfall this series.”  Nowitzki had 34 points for the Mavericks and  Jason Kidd 
added 16 points.  The Thunder advance to the second round to play the winner
of the series between the  Los Angeles Lakers  and Colorado
Nuggets. The Lakers, who visit the Nuggets tonight, have a 2-1
lead in their series.  Clippers Win  At Staples Center in Los Angeles, Eric Bledsoe gave the
Clippers an 87-83 lead on a free throw with 12 seconds left to
play. Rudy Gay narrowed the gap to 87-86 with a 26-foot 3-
pointer with eight seconds remaining and then missed a 25-foot
3-pointer at the buzzer that would have given the Grizzlies the
win.  Chris Paul had 24 points and 11 assists and  Blake Griffin 
scored 17 points for the Clippers. Gay scored 24 and Zach Randolph contributed 17 for the Grizzlies.  At Amway Center in Orlando, David West had 26 points and 12
rebounds and Danny Granger added 21 points for the Pacers, who
host the Magic in Game 5 on May 8.  Jason Richardson had 25 points and Glen Davis tallied 24
points and 11 rebounds for the Magic.  In games tonight, the  Chicago Bulls  try to even their
series against the Philadelphia 76ers at two games each, the  New
York  Knicks look for a victory to avoid elimination by the Miami
Heat and the  Boston Celtics  take a 2-1 series lead into a home
game against the  Atlanta Hawks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
