A French journalist, Romeo Langlois,
is being held as a “prisoner of war” by Colombian FARC
guerrillas, a commander from the Marxist rebel group said.  Langlois is lightly injured in one arm, according to the
guerrilla, who identified himself as “Monazo,” a squadron
commander from the group’s 15th Front, in a statement recorded
by freelance journalists Karl Penhaul and Carlos Villalon
yesterday.  “The French journalist Romeo Langlois, captured in combat
wearing military uniform, is in our hands,” the guerrilla read
in a video posted by Penhaul on  YouTube  today. “He is a
prisoner of war.”  “Monazo” attributed the statement to senior commanders of
the 15th Front, which is holding the French journalist. In a
telephone interview today, Penhaul, a former CNN and Reuters
reporter, said he traveled to southern Colombia with Chilean
photographer Villalon last week to meet the rebels. The
statement from the guerrillas was dated April 30.  Penhaul said he made the recording on May 5. As for the
man who gave the interview, Penhaul said: “He’s a squad
commander, he’s a junior commander of the 15th front, and he was
speaking on direct verbal authorization by senior commanders of
the Southern Bloc.”  Langlois was captured on April 28 when guerrillas attacked
troops on a counter-narcotics operation he was filming in
southern  Colombia , and was injured during a firefight.  FARC is the Spanish acronym for the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, which has been waging war against the
nation’s government for almost five decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
