Britain increased the amount it
received in taxes from its richest citizens by 23 percent in the
fiscal year that ended in March, Treasury Minister David Gauke
said.  The Revenue and Customs High Net Worth Unit that deals with
the tax affairs of about 5,000 people with wealth of at least 20
million pounds ($32 million) raised about 200 million pounds,
compared with 162 million pounds in the previous tax year, the
Treasury said. In the year through March 2010, the tax raised
from this group was 85 million pounds.  “The tax affairs of the very wealthy can be very complex
and so require specialist attention,” Gauke said in an e-mailed
statement released by his office in  London . The unit is
“delivering real results for the country.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said in his
March 21 budget that he’s reducing the top rate of income tax to
45 percent from 50 percent starting in 2013, arguing that the
higher levy generated little revenue and encouraged avoidance.
Osborne said he will squeeze tax avoiders in return for having
cut the top rate.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservative Party is
suffering a backlash from voters who see the  tax cut  on the
highest earners as unjust at a time when  living standards  for
most are falling and the government is scaling back services in
the biggest public-spending squeeze since World War II.  To contact the reporter on this story:
