Spain may pull its financial aid to
Bolivia after the Andean country seized the local assets of
Spain’s  Red Electrica Corp. (REE) , Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said in an interview with ABC.  Spain is in a “very delicate” situation after the
expropriations in Argentina and Bolivia because it needs to
remain united with the U.S. and other  European Union states,
Margallo said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
