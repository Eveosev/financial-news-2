Volkswagen AG (VOW)  works council chief
Bernd Osterloh wants to limit executive pay after CEO Martin Winterkorn received a record 18.3 million euros ($24 million)
for 2011, Der Spiegel said.  That can be done by simply capping compensation or by
raising incentive targets, the magazine cited Osterloh as saying
in an e-mailed summary of an article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
