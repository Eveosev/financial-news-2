LightSquared Inc., the wireless-
network company backed by billionaire  Philip Falcone , received a
second weeklong extension from creditors, delaying a potential
bankruptcy, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  The move gives LightSquared more time to negotiate before
having to revisit a waiver that is keeping its debt from going
into default. Before the original April 30 deadline, Falcone
conditionally agreed to a request by creditors that he step down
from the Reston, Virginia-based company’s board and executive
committee, according to people familiar with the talks who
weren’t authorized to speak publicly.  Falcone, who effectively has been running LightSquared
since February, has to decide whether to hand over part of his
stake in the company to creditors. If he can’t come to terms,
LightSquared faces bankruptcy.  Billionaire  Carl Icahn , one of LightSquared’s creditors,
has sold his $250 million in debt holdings, Reuters  reported 
yesterday. Icahn received about 60 cents on the dollar for the
holdings on May 3, after originally paying about 40 cents on the
dollar months earlier, Reuters said, citing unnamed sources.  Icahn and Falcone didn’t immediately respond to requests
for comment.  FCC’s Rejection  Falcone’s original plan for LightSquared depended on
winning the  U.S. Federal Communications Commission ’s approval to
convert airwaves designated for satellite service to spectrum
for land-based radio towers. The company invested $4 billion in
airwaves and forged deals with more than 30 partners, including
Best Buy Co.  LightSquared hit a roadblock in February when the FCC said
it would withdraw preliminary approval for the company’s network
after government tests found that the signals would interfere
with global-positioning systems. The decision followed a
yearlong lobbying fight between LightSquared and GPS users and
providers. The Coalition to Save Our GPS, a group formed to
opposed LightSquared’s plans, included package shippers FedEx
Corp. and  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , GPS-equipment maker Garmin
Ltd. and farm-gear manufacturer Deere & Co.  Falcone said earlier this year that he was considering
bankruptcy for LightSquared, though he would rather get the
government to swap his spectrum for that controlled by the U.S.
Department of Defense.  Sprint Deal  On March 16, Sprint Nextel Corp. handed LightSquared one of
its biggest setbacks when it ended an 11-year agreement to
build, operate and share the network. LightSquared paid Sprint
$310 million in advance, and Sprint said in a securities filing
Feb. 27 that it would return $65 million of the payments it has
received from LightSquared.  LightSquared had originally agreed to pay  Overland Park ,
Kansas-based Sprint $9 billion for the network duties and issue
an additional $4.5 billion in service credits. The deal hinged
on approval from the FCC.  On Feb. 28, soon after the FCC decision, LightSquared Chief
Executive Officer  Sanjiv Ahuja  resigned. The company appointed
Falcone to the board as it began a search for a new CEO.
LightSquared also cut 45 percent of its 330-member staff to
preserve cash.  The company said the government tests were rigged and the
results were bogus. LightSquared has vowed to work on a solution
to the interference issue. On March 13, the company said it
hired litigators  Theodore Olson  and Eugene Scalia of Gibson Dunn
& Crutcher LLP in preparation for a possible legal battle with
U.S. regulators.  After skipping two payments to Inmarsat Plc in February and
March for what it called incomplete work, LightSquared made a
$56.3 million payment to the British satellite partner in April.
The payment gave LightSquared a two-year extension on the next
payment deadline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
