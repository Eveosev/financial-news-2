An al-Qaeda leader, convicted in  Yemen 
for involvement in attacking the USS Cole in 2000, was killed in
an air strike in that country, the state al-Gomhoriah paper
reported in its SMS mobile news service  Fahd al-Quso, 37, and another man were killed yesterday in
a mountainous region in the southeastern province of Shabwa,
according to al-Gomhoriah. Al-Quso was hit by a missile as he
stepped out of his vehicle, along with another al-Qaeda
operative, the Associated Press reported, citing unidentified
Yemeni military officials.  Al-Quso is on the U.S. list of “most wanted terrorists”
for conspiracy to murder Americans. He was indicted on 50
terrorism charges by a federal grand jury in  Manhattan  in 2003
for participating in the attack on the USS Cole that killed 17
American sailors while the destroyer was refueling in Yemen’s
port of Aden.  The airstrike resembled earlier U.S. drone attacks, though
the U.S. didn’t immediately confirm it, according to the
 Associated Press .  Al-Quso was convicted by a Yemeni court for his role in the
Cole attack. He served more than five years in a Yemeni prison,
the Associated Press reported.  The Cole was set to take on fuel in Aden en route to the
 Persian Gulf  when a small craft offering to assist with mooring
lines moved alongside the warship and exploded. The blast ripped
into an engine room of the vessel, one of the Navy’s most
advanced warships.  To contact the reporter on this story:
