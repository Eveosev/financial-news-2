China International Fund and  Bellzone
Mining Plc (BZM)  are interested in taking over  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) ’s
Simandou iron-ore project in Guinea, the Sunday Times reported,
citing a presentation from last year.  CIF and Bellzone made a pitch to the Guinea government to
develop the project after Rio had already reached a deal,
according to the presentation, which was dated August 2011, the
newspaper said.  “What’s wrong with that?” Bellzone Chief Executive
Officer Nik Zuks said last week about attempting to take over
Simandou, the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
