HgCapital has hired Jefferies Group
Inc. to look for buyers for its Mercury Pharma business in a
deal that could be valued at more than 350 million pounds ($565
million), the Sunday Times reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  HgCapital acquired Mercury, previously known as Goldshield,
in a 179 million pound management buyout in 2009, the newspaper
said. HgCapital declined to comment, the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
