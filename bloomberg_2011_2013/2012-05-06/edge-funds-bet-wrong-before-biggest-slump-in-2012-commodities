Hedge funds  raised bets on higher
commodity prices for the first time in six weeks, just before
the biggest three-day slump since October as U.S. jobs data fell
short of expectations and European manufacturing contracted.  Money managers increased net-long positions across 18 U.S.
futures and options by 6.9 percent to 895,240  contracts  in the
week ended May 1, the biggest gain since Feb. 28, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show. Bullish copper wagers
surged sevenfold before prices fell for three days, and soybean
bets reached the highest since at least June 2006 as the oilseed
capped the biggest weekly loss since mid-January.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
tumbled 4.9 percent in the three sessions ended May 4, the most
since Oct. 4. Reports showed last week that services and
manufacturing output shrank last month in the euro region and
the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast in April. Open interest,
or contracts outstanding, across commodities fell 2 percent in
the seven sessions through April 30, the longest slide since
November, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We had some soft data points along the edges that’s taken
some of the steam out of the market,” said Kelly Wiesbrock, who
helps manage $1.3 billion of assets for San Francisco-based
hedge fund Harvest Capital Strategies. “It’s hard to know
whether this is a just a little bit of a pause, or if this is
something bigger.”  Prices Slide  The S&P GSCI plunged 4.5 percent last week, the most since
Dec. 16. The MSCI All-Country World Index of  equities  dropped
2.3 percent, and the dollar rose 1 percent against a basket of
six major currencies. Treasuries returned 0.3 percent, a Bank of
America Corp. index shows.  The GSCI extended its drop today, falling 0.2 percent to
close at 652.27. The gauge capped a fourth straight decline, the
longest slide since August.  Twenty-two of the raw materials tracked by the S&P GSCI
declined last week. Gasoline plunged 7.2 percent, copper dropped
2.7 percent and soybeans fell 1 percent. On May 4, crude oil
slumped below $100 a barrel for the first time since February.  Payrolls in the U.S. rose 115,000 in April, the smallest
gain in six months, the Labor Department said May 4. That
compared with the median estimate of 160,000 in a Bloomberg
survey of 85 economists. Unemployment in the 17 countries that
use the euro rose to a 15-year high and manufacturing contracted
for a ninth month, reports from the European Union’s statistics
office and Markit Economics on May 2 showed. European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said May 3 that the economic outlook
has become “more uncertain.”  Chinese Homes  Chinese  home prices  fell to a 14-month low in April,  SouFun
Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , the nation’s biggest real-estate website owner,
reported May 2. The country is the biggest buyer of everything
from copper to cotton to soybeans.  The outlook for commodity markets is weaker as  China ’s
growth slows, Europe’s debt crisis intensifies and because the
 Federal Reserve  is less likely to purchase more debt to
stimulate growth, ABN Amro Bank NV said in a report May 2. The
S&P GSCI rose more than 80 percent from December 2008 to June
2011 as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of
quantitative easing and held borrowing costs at a record low.  Soy Crops  Commodity prices may prove resilient as drought damages
soybean crops in  South America , copper inventories tumble and
rains disrupt sugar supplies in  Brazil , the biggest grower.  Sixteen of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect
soybeans to gain this week and one was neutral, the highest
proportion since March 16. Prices reached $15.125 a bushel on
May 2, the most since July 2008. Hedge funds lifted their wagers
by 4.3 percent to 253,889 contracts, the CFTC data show.  Stockpiles of copper monitored by the London Metal Exchange
tumbled 38 percent this year to the lowest level since October
2008. Jiangxi Copper Co. plans to ship metal to nearby LME
warehouses to bring down prices, China’s largest producer of the
metal said May 2.  “While there may be some slack from  Europe , if the U.S.
and emerging market economies continue to show signs of
improvement, that will bode well for the commodity markets
longer term,” said Nelson Louie, the global head of commodities
at New York-based Credit Suisse Asset Management who helps
manage $11 billion of assets.  Commodity Funds  Investors withdrew $357 million from commodity funds in the
week ended May 2, according to data from Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which tracks money flows. Gold
and precious-metals outflows totaled $349 million,  Cameron
Brandt , the director of research, said by phone.  Speculators raised bets on higher crude-oil prices by 12
percent to 219,817 contracts, the biggest gain since Feb. 14,
the CFTC data show. Crude oil declined 6.1 percent in  New York 
last week.  U.S. crude stockpiles increased 2.84 million barrels to
375.9 million in the seven days ended April 27, the most since
September 1990, according to an Energy Department report May 2.
Domestic output gained 8,000 barrels a day to 6.12 million, the
highest level since November 1999.  Wagers on copper increased sevenfold to 15,582, as prices
slumped 2.7 percent, the first weekly drop in three. Bullish
gold bets climbed 7.9 percent to 116,061, a four-week high.
Bullion slumped 1.2 percent in New York last week on speculation
that the Fed will be reluctant to buy more debt to shore up
growth, easing concern that inflation will accelerate.  Chicago Futures  A  measure  of net-longs for 11 U.S. farm goods rose 0.1
percent to 512,512 contracts, the CFTC said. Corn holdings
climbed 9 percent to 112,328, the biggest increase since March
6. Futures in  Chicago  dropped 0.8 percent last week, leaving
prices down 4.1 percent this year.  Global food  costs  fell for the first time this year in
April, the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said
on May 3, and prices are down 10 percent from the all-time high
reached in February 2011.  “Agriculture and other energy type commodities will most
likely be dragged down due to concerns on slow growth of the
U.S. and negative growth in Europe,” said Stephen Hammers, the
Nashville, Tennessee-based chief investment officer at Compass
EMP Funds, which manages about $1 billion of assets. “News is
not expected to be as bright as it was last quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
