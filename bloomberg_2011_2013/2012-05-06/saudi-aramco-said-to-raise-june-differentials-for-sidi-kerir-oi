Saudi Arabian Oil Co. raised
differentials used to determine  official selling prices for
June shipments from  Egypt ’s Sidi Kerir port on the  Mediterranean
Sea , two people familiar with the pricing decision said.  The state-owned producer, known as  Saudi Aramco , narrowed
the discount on its Arab Light crude by 75 cents a barrel, to
$1.75 less than the Brent weighted average posted by
Intercontinental Exchange Inc., according to the people, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
Arab Extra Light was set at a 65 cent premium to the benchmark,
a 20 cent increase from the May price formula, the people said.  Aramco, the world’s largest crude exporter, yesterday said
it was raising differentials used to determine the June prices
for all grades to be shipped to customers in the U.S., northwest
 Europe  and the Mediterranean and cutting those to  Asia .  The following table gives differentials for the four grades
from Sidi Kerir in the Mediterranean in relation to benchmark
prices, the month-on-month changes and the degrees of gravity as
defined by the  American Petroleum Institute . Prices are in U.S.
dollars a barrel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
