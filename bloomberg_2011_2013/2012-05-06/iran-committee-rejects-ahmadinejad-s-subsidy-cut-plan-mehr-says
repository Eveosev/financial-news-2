An Iranian parliamentary committee
rejected a plan by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s government to further
increase the prices of subsidized energy and food, the state-run
 Mehr  news agency reported.  The Parliament’s Integration committee rejected yesterday
the size of the cuts proposed by the government, Mehr said. In
the draft budget for the Iranian year started March 20, which
Ahmadinejad presented to lawmakers in February and is yet to be
approved by the parliament, the government’s revenue from
subsidy cuts was set at $110 billion compared with some $44
billion the year before, according to the Mehr report.  The committee’s decision means that the government’s plan
to introduce the second phase of a subsidies reform plan started
it Dec. 2010, may fail to take place in the current Iranian
year, the Mehr report published late yesterday said. The five-
year plan consists of phasing out energy and food subsidies and
replacing them with cash payments to the poor.  The government had sought to introduce the second step of
the plan earlier this year and was faced with critics warning of
spiraling inflation at a time when Iranians are already
grappling with a surge in prices following tightening
international sanctions over  Iran’s nuclear program .  The committee’s decision needs to be endorsed by a majority
of the parliament, Mehr said. The parliament may agree to raise
energy prices to some extent, but “far less” than the
government had requested, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
