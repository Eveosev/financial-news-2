Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  may sell part of
its 10 percent stake in  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  if the price is right,
Sacyr Chairman Manuel Manrique said, El Pais reported.  The goal of any sale would be to repay some debt and extend
the rest, Manrique said in an interview with the Spanish
newspaper. Sacyr plans to sell some assets to raise funds for
new projects and will also focus on reducing debt while
containing costs, Manrique said, adding he expects the company
to post a first-quarter profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
