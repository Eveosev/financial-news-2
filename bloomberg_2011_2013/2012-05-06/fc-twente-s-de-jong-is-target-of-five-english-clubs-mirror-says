Manchester United is among five
Premier League soccer clubs interested in signing FC Twente’s
Netherlands striker Luuk  de Jong ,  the Mirror reported .  The 21-year-old is also wanted by Chelsea, Liverpool,
Newcastle and Tottenham, while Everton manager David Moyes
watched him play last weekend, the newspaper said, without
citing anyone.  Twente has already received offers of 12 million pounds
($19.4 million) from Germany’s Borussia Moenchengladbach and
Bayer Leverkusen, but De Jong favors a move to England, the
Mirror added.  De Jong has scored 62 goals in the past two seasons, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
