The death of an unidentified Hispanic
male at Churchill Downs racetrack, where yesterday’s  Kentucky
Derby  was run, is being treated as a homicide, police said.  Security staff at the racetrack called police at 4:50
a.m. local time today after discovering the body in a barn,
a  Louisville Metro Police  spokeswoman, Alicia Smiley, said in a
telephone interview.  “Upon investigation it became clear that foul play was
involved,” Smiley said. “It’s an active and ongoing
investigation. Our homicide detectives are still at Churchill
Downs.”  The deceased wasn’t a jockey or an employee of the
racetrack, Smiley said. Police are trying to determine whether
he worked for a trainer or other person involved in racing, she
said. Investigators don’t know what the motive was for the
killing, and are leaving it to the coroner to determine the
cause of death.  Autopsy results are expected tomorrow, Smiley said.  The body was found in a barn occupied by a Louisville
trainer, Angel Montano Sr., the  Associated Press  reported,
citing Smiley. The barn is about 150 yards (137 meters) from
where Derby winner I’ll Have Another is kept, AP said.  I’ll Have Another won the 138th Derby by 1 1/2 lengths. The
three-year-old colt came through in the final furlong to pass
Bodemeister, who finished second.  To contact the reporter on this story:
