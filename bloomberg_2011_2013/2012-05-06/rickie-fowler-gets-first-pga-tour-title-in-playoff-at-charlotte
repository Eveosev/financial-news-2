Rickie Fowler got his breakthrough win
in his 72nd career U.S.  PGA Tour  start, beating Rory McIlroy and
D.A. Points in a playoff at golf’s Wells Fargo Championship.  Fowler, 23, hit a wedge to four feet on the first extra
hole to set up the winning birdie yesterday at the Quail Hollow
Club in  Charlotte , North Carolina. He received $1.17 million for
his first U.S. victory.  “I definitely knew I was good enough,” Fowler, who spent
time as the world’s No. 1-ranked amateur golfer in 2007 and 2008
before being named the PGA Tour’s top rookie in 2010. “It was
just getting everything to come together and stay patient.”  Fowler, McIlroy and Points finished regulation play tied at
14-under par, one stroke better than 54-hole leader  Webb Simpson , who shot a final-round 73. Fowler closed with a 69
yesterday, while McIlroy had a 70 and Points shot 71, including
his lone bogey of the weekend on the 18th hole.  In the playoff, Fowler struck a wedge from 132 yards that
stopped just over four feet from the flag. He dropped the birdie
putt after Points and McIlroy, the 2010 Wells Fargo Championship
winner, had made their long par attempts.  Fowler, whose only previous professional title came at last
year’s Korea Open, became the third-youngest winner at Quail
Hollow after McIlroy (20) and Anthony Kim (22) in 2008.  Northern Ireland’s McIlroy, who was denied his second win
in 2012, returned to the No. 1 spot in golf’s Official World
Ranking. He entered the week needing to tie for seventh place or
better to replace  Luke Donald  atop the rankings.  “It’s a little consolation,” McIlroy, 23, said during a
news conference. “I would rather win the tournament. I want to
try and play well for the next few weeks and try and solidify my
spot there at No. 1.”  Tiger Woods  missed the two-round cut at the event, his
first since last month’s Masters Tournament.  The PGA Tour next moves to the TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra
Beach, Florida, for the $9.5 million  Players Championship .  To contact the reporter on this story:
