Libya ’s Arabian Gulf Oil Co. has not
reduced crude production, its parent National Oil Corp. said on
its website, refuting an earlier statement from the company
known also as Agoco.  Abdul Jalil Mayuf, an Agoco spokesman, said yesterday by
telephone from the eastern city of Benghazi that the company had
reduced output by 30,000 barrels a day to about 340,000 barrels
a day because protesters had been blocking the entrance to its
headquarters for more than a week. National Oil today denied
that Agoco has decreased production, in the statement on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
