A panel of Egyptian judges postponed a
case contesting the constitutionality of parts of a law
regulating last year’s legislative vote which Islamists won.  The advisory panel gave the government’s lawyers and the
plaintiff who filed the case one month to present written
arguments, the state-run Middle East  News Agency  reported. It is
expected to issue a legal opinion about the case, MENA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
