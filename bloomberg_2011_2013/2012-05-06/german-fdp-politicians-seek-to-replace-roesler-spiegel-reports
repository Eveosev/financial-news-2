Several Free Democratic Party
politicians are working to replace Philipp Roesler as head of
the party that forms a coalition government with German
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, Der Spiegel
reported, citing an unidentified member of the FDP’s leadership.  The party’s caucus chief,  Rainer Bruederle , should succeed
Roesler this year because he doesn’t have the necessary
qualities to lead the party into the next federal election, the
Hamburg-based magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
