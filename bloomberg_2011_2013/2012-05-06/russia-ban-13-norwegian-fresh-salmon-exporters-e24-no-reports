Russia on Saturday banned fresh salmon
imports from 13 Norwegian producers as the Russian food
inspection made “reoccurring findings of produce not consistent
with the authority’s standard”, business site E24.no reported,
citing the Norwegian news agency NTB.  Norwegian authorities received prior warning of the import
ban less than a week ago, E24.no said, citing NTB, while the ban
did not affect exports of frozen salmon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
