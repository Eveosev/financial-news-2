The U.S. Treasury Department said it
agreed to sell $5 billion of shares in  American International
Group Inc. (AIG)  in a stock offering, with the bailed-out insurer
buying $2 billion of the total.  The Treasury is selling 163.9 million shares at $30.50
each, compared with the May 4 closing price of $32.83, the
department said in an e-mailed statement today.  The transaction, the Treasury’s third  offering  of AIG
shares since last May, lowers the government’s stake in AIG to
63 percent from 70 percent, according to the statement. The U.S.
rescued AIG in 2008 as the New York-based firm was overwhelmed
by losses on bets tied to mortgages.  “We’re continuing to make significant progress exiting our
investment in AIG,” Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability
Tim Massad, said in the statement.  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., Credit
Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Macquarie Group Ltd., Morgan Stanley, UBS
AG and  Wells Fargo & Co . were the government’s banks on the
offering, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
