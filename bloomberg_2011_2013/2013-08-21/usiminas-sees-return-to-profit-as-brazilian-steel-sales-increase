Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA ,  Brazil ’s second-largest steelmaker by output, expects to
resume profits after six straight quarters of net losses as it
boosts prices and shipments of the alloy.  Usiminas, as the Belo Horizonte-based company is known, is
“very close” to turning a profit again, Chief Financial
Officer Ronald Seckelmann said in a meeting with investors in
 Sao Paulo  today. Steel sales volumes in  Latin America ’s largest
economy are likely to grow more than 5 percent this year, above
the industry average, Sales Vice-President Sergio Leite said.  Brazilian steelmakers are raising prices as a 18 percent
slump in the real in six months, the worst performance of 16
major currencies, reduces the competitiveness of imports.
Usiminas, the largest steel supplier to Brazil’s auto industry,
posted an adjusted second-quarter loss of 59.5 million reais
($25 million), less than half the average of five analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Usiminas is not interested “in principle” in buying a
stake in MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the iron-ore producer
that former billionaire  Eike Batista  is seeking to sell,
Seckelmann said. The company’s MRS Logistica SA railway joint
venture didn’t make any offer for MMX, he said, denying a report
by newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo.  Usiminas  climbed  1.2 percent to 10.37 reais at 12:19 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. MMX gained 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
