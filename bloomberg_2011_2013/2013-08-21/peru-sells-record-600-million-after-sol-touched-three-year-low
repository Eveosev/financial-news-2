Peru ’s central bank sold a record
$600 million in the local foreign-exchange market to support the
sol after it touched a three-year low this week.  The  central bank ’s move today increased the amount of
dollars sold since July 2 to $2.65 billion, according to its
website. Peru’s currency has plunged 9.2 percent this year as
metal exports dropped and slower economic growth curbed demand
for the country’s financial assets.  The sol touched 2.84 per U.S. dollar on Aug. 19, its
weakest intraday level since June 2010. It gained 0.1 percent to
2.8110 at today’s close, according to prices from Datatec.  “The central bank is probably looking to help with the
rearranging of portfolios while trying to avoid any abrupt
movements” in the sol,  Hugo Perea , the chief economist at  BBVA
Banco Continental  in Lima, said in a phone interview. “It has a
lot of reserves. Interventions of this magnitude are not
unsustainable though nor are they likely to be very common.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
