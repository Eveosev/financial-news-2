India’s (SENSEX)  benchmark index declined to
an 11-month low as the rupee weakened to a record. Technology
companies and drugmakers led the losses.  State Bank of India  dropped 0.4 percent, erasing an early
rally of 6.2 percent.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the nation’s second-largest
software maker, slid 1.6 percent. The S&P BSE Infotech Index has
surged 28 percent this year, compared with the 7.8 percent fall
in the S&P BSE Sensex.  Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) , India’s
biggest drugmaker, slumped 13 percent, the most since February
2009. The stock soared 33 percent this month through yesterday.
Eight of the 30 Sensex stocks retreated more than 4 percent.  The Sensex slumped 1.9 percent to 17,905.91, the lowest
close since Sept. 11. The gauge climbed as much as 1.8 percent
earlier after the central bank said it would buy  government
bonds  to stem a surge in long-term borrowing costs. The rupee’s
slide to a record 64.55 per dollar sparked concern that policy
makers’ scope to revive the economy will be curbed. The  Reserve
Bank  of India in July raised two rates to support the currency.  “There is complete panic in the market as the rupee has
gone into a free fall,”  Manish Sonthalia , a Mumbai-based money
manager at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $200 million in stocks, said by phone. “The RBI and the
government are running out of options.”  Foreign funds have pulled about $12 billion from domestic
stocks and bonds while the rupee has slid 15 percent since May
22, when the Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled
the U.S. may taper stimulus policies if the economy improves.
They sold a net $214 million of local shares on Aug. 20, the
most since July 12, data from the regulator showed. That pared
this year’s inflow into stocks to $12.2 billion, still the
second-highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  ‘No Rush’  “We took some money off the table,” Aadil Ebrahim, a Hong
Kong-based portfolio manager at Bowen Asia Ltd., said in an
interview on Bloomberg TV India today. “There’s no rush to go
back to India for the time being.”  The Federal Open Market Committee publishes minutes of its
July meeting today, with 65 percent of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predicting the Fed will taper bond purchases, known as
quantitative easing, in September.  State Bank  fell 6.1 rupees to 1,548 rupees. Infosys lost
1.6 percent to 2,958.75 rupees. Larger rival  Tata Consultancy
Services Ltd. (TCS)  declined 1.1 percent to 1,717.8 rupees.  Wipro
Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest software services provider, retreated
1.4 percent to 441.95 rupees.  ‘Booking Profit’  Ranbaxy, which gets 79 percent of its sales from overseas,
fell 50 rupees to 331.25 rupees.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. (SUNP) , India’s largest drugmaker by value, slumped 4.9 percent to
482.45 rupees, paring this year’s advance to 31 percent.  “Selling in export-oriented companies and net foreign
exchange earners shows investors are booking profit,” S. Ranganathan, head of research at LKP Shares & Securities Ltd.,
said in an interview on Bloomberg TV India.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest
refining complex, lost 5.1 percent to 783.6 rupees. Cigarette
maker  ITC Ltd. (ITC)  decreased 4.6 percent to 300.85 rupees. The two
stocks have a combined 20 percent weighting on the Sensex.  The RBI last month increased both the marginal standing
facility rate, and the bank rate by 200 basis points to 10.25
percent. It tightened banks’ daily reserve requirements and
drained money through securities offerings to boost the rupee.  Bond Purchases  The central bank will buy 80 billion rupees ($1.3 billion)
of bonds in the open market on Aug. 23 and reduce weekly sales
of cash-management bills to rein in a surge in yields, it said
in a  statement  yesterday.  “They’ve tried in bits and pieces to stabilize the rupee,
and it hasn’t worked,” Bowen’s Ebrahim said. “The market has
stopped reacting to government announcements. It wants to see
action on the ground.”  The Sensex is  valued  at 12.7 times projected 12-month
profits, compared with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 9.8
times, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange slid 1.8
percent to 5,302.55, its lowest level since Sept. 6. India VIX
climbed 3.2 percent, extending its four-day advance to 50
percent, the data show.  Volume on the Sensex was 55 percent higher than the 30-day
average at the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
