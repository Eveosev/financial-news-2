(Corrects date of talks in second paragraph of story dated
Aug. 21.)  South African workers at carmakers
including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and
 General Motors Co. (GM)  will strike for a fourth day tomorrow while
employers reopen wage talks with union leaders.  The National Union of Metalworkers of South  Africa  received
a request from the automakers to resume negotiations on Aug. 22,
the union said in an e-mailed statement today. The walkout will
continue while talks take place and Numsa will discuss the
outcome with workers on Aug. 23, it said.  About 30,000 workers are striking at the country’s seven
main carmakers and two medium- and heavy-vehicle assemblers in
 Pretoria , Durban,  Port Elizabeth  and East London, according to
the  union . The boycott is costing the automotive industry as
much as 700 million rand ($68.4 million) a day, the National
Association of Automobile Manufacturers of  South Africa 
estimated on Aug. 16.  “We are looking for progress” at the meeting between the
industry and the union, Naamsa spokesman Thapelo Molapo said by
phone today. He declined to comment on what the carmakers would
offer to end the strike.  Employer representatives reverted to an initial proposal of
an 8 percent wage increase for the first contract year after an
inconclusive meeting on Aug. 19, Mphumzi Maqungo, treasurer of
the Numsa, said today in a phone interview. Prior to the
meeting, the manufacturers proposed a 10 percent raise for the
first year and 8 percent for the next two years, he said.  The union, with 323,000 members across a range of
industries in Africa’s biggest economy, is seeking a 14 percent
annual increase in auto-worker wages, improved medical benefits
and shift flexibility.  The car industry accounts for 7 percent of South Africa’s
gross domestic product, according to  Department of Trade and
Industry  estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
