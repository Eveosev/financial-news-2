Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP) ’s plans to
expand in Nigeria are being slowed by a lack of available sites
as the grocer looks to grow revenue outside its home market.  Nigeria, with more than 160 million people, could
eventually carry about the same number of stores as Shoprite has
in South Africa, Chief Executive Officer Whitey Basson said in a
presentation in Johannesburg yesterday. South Africa’s largest
retailer, which has more than 800 stores in its home market, is
in the process of adding 37 stores to the seven it already has
in the West African country.  “Nigeria could handle 600 to 800 stores if you look at the
size of the cities,” Basson said. “Growth in Nigeria can go
quickly, but that’s not dependent on Shoprite, but on sites.
Non-South  Africa  property development is slower than we like.”  As food retail in South Africa is becoming saturated and
more competitive, Shoprite is expanding in the rest of Africa.
Sales for the year through June climbed 28 percent to 11.7
billion rand ($1.1 billion) in supermarkets outside its home
market as the rand weakened against the dollar and some African
currencies, making imports from South Africa more affordable.
Supermarkets in the region contribute 14.2 percent to total
revenue.  In addition to a lack of available property, supply lines
outside of South Africa “remain a huge challenge,” Basson
said. Shoprite’s lead time in Nigeria is 117 days and the
retailer is considering building a distribution center in the
west African country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
