Shares in Trade Me Group, which owns
 New Zealand ’s largest auction website, headed for a record
decline after the company said earnings growth will slow.  The stock fell 5.5 percent to NZ$4.44 at 3:18 p.m. in
Wellington, the most since it listed in December 2011 and
putting it on course for its lowest close since Feb. 25. Earlier
today, the company said full-year net income rose 4 percent to
NZ$78.6 million ($62 million) on sales of NZ$164.1 million,
which climbed 15 percent.  In the coming year, “we expect to grow top line revenue
and bottom line earnings, but these will reflect slower growth
than we’ve recorded this year while we focus on reinvestment in
the business,” Chief Executive Officer Jon Macdonald said in a
statement.  Trade Me was founded in 1999 by then 23-year-old Sam Morgan
when he couldn’t find a heater to buy on the Internet, according
to Trade Me’s  company history . It was bought in 2006 for NZ$750
million by  Australia ’s  Fairfax Media Ltd. (FXJ) , which then sold its
shares in the company in stages for a net A$1.04 billion ($940
million).  Trade Me, which lists goods from books to antiques to real
estate, said today it has agreed to buy online insurance
comparison website LifeDirect for an undisclosed amount.  “It fits well with our core purpose of connecting two
parties to undertake a transaction or form a relationship,”
Macdonald said. “LifeDirect is an excellent business with a
strong team, has a lot of potential for growth, and we think we
can add a lot of value as a source of new customers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
