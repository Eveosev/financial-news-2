Copper and zinc declined ahead of
minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting that may provide
clues on the pace of stimulus and trade data from China, the
biggest user of industrial metals.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to $7,286 a metric ton and
was at $7,302 at 10:42 a.m. in Tokyo. Zinc retreated 0.5 percent
to $1,979 a ton.  Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s July 30-31
meeting due today may signal when policy makers plan to taper
the $85 billion of monthly bond purchases. The Beijing-based
Customs General Administration will release data today for July
imports and exports of non-ferrous metals including copper.  “The market is looking for a direction from upcoming
economic data,” said Wu Jianguo, an analyst at Maike Futures
Brokerage in  Shanghai . “Copper prices could climb further if
the PMI figures tomorrow continue showing a recovery.”  A manufacturing gauge for China due tomorrow from  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Markit Economics will show a preliminary
reading for August of 48.2, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Levels below 50 signal contraction.  Futures for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.5 percent to 52,430  yuan  ($8,556) a ton. Metal
for delivery in December fell 0.3 percent at $3.3325 a pound on
the Comex in New York.  On the LME, nickel and lead fell, while aluminum was little
changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
