Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s
largest lender, named Mayur Nallamala head of Asian equities for
its asset-management unit.  Nallamala, who previously worked for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
will oversee $1.5 billion of stocks and lead a team of Hong-Kong-based portfolio managers and analysts, RBC said today in an
e-mailed statement. He will work with Adam Matthews, a former
JPMorgan colleague who runs business and development for the
unit in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the statement.  “Mayur brings a rigorous investment philosophy that is
consistent with our own approach, a solid track record in the
region and a strong background in serving clients,” Dan Chornous, chief investment officer of Toronto-based RBC Global
Asset Management, said in the statement.  Nallamala, a graduate of the London School of Economics,
spent eight years at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong,
where he managed $4 billion for Asian sovereign-wealth,
institutional and retail customers, according to the statement.
He’s succeeding  Yoji Takeda , who plans to retire in coming
months, said Matthew Gierasimczuk, an RBC spokesman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
