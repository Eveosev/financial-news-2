Japanese stocks  fell, with the Topix
index closing at the lowest level in almost eight weeks, as
concern that the  Federal Reserve  will soon pare stimulus drove a
slump in equities across  Asia .  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , owner of the crippled Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, pared an earlier loss of 15 percent to
decline 9.3 percent as a regulatory body said it would raise the
severity of a leak of contaminated water at the plant. Kintetsu
Corp., a passenger rail company, fell 6.4 percent on a share
sale plan.  Tokyo  Electron Ltd. gained the most on the Nikkei 225
Stock Average on a report that its orders of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment may rise this quarter.  The Topix swung between gains and losses today before
dropping 0.3 percent to close at 1,121.74 in Tokyo, the lowest
since June 27. About two stocks fell for each that gained on the
measure. The  Nikkei 225  rose 0.2 percent to 13,424.33. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  will release minutes of its July
30-31 meeting today, with investors seeking clues on when the
central bank will pare $85 billion in monthly asset purchases.  “Investors are cautious ahead of the Fed’s minutes as
there’s ongoing concern tapering of quantitative easing will
cause negative impacts,” said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based equity
strategist at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees
about 6.1 trillion yen ($63 billion).  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped for a fifth day while a
gauge of emerging-market equities headed for the lowest close in
six weeks.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.1
percent today. The measure rose 0.4 percent yesterday, snapping
a four-day losing streak.  Carmakers and utilities  contributed  the most to the  Topix (TPX) ’s
loss among its 33 industry groups. Toyota Motor Corp., a
carmaker that gets 31 percent of its revenue in North America,
dropped 2.1 percent to 6,030 yen. Mazda Motor Corp., which
depends on North America for about 30 percent of its revenue,
declined 2.2 percent to 399 yen.  Tokyo Electric, known as Tepco, slumped 9.3 percent to 557
yen after  Japan ’s Nuclear Regulation Authority said the
radioactive water leak is a three, or a ‘serious incident’ on
the seven-level International Nuclear and Radiological Event
Scale.  The Tepco risk had been priced in somewhat and its impact
on broader  market sentiment  seems to have been limited,
according to Kubo at Nissay Asset.  Share Sale  Kintetsu dropped 6.4 percent to 396 yen, the biggest
decline in almost two years, after announcing a plan to raise as
much as 78.3 billion yen in a share sale.  Japanese shares have led gains among developed markets this
year amid optimism that record stimulus by the  Bank of Japan  and
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic reforms will boost growth.
Their relative performance has lagged in the past three months,
with the Topix dropping about 12 percent from its May 22 close,
which was the highest since 2008.  BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the economy can expand an
average 2 percent over the next three years and a scheduled
sales tax increase won’t hurt growth, public broadcaster NHK
reported. The central bank won’t hesitate to implement further
monetary easing if risks of an economic slowdown heighten, the
Mainichi newspaper reported, citing an interview with Kuroda.  Among shares that rose, Tokyo Electron gained 3.8 percent
to 4,240 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported semiconductor
manufacturing equipment orders are expected to rise about 7
percent this quarter to 105 billion yen.  Sony Corp., an electronics maker that gets 16 percent of
its revenue in the U.S., increased 0.5 percent to 1,937 yen
after saying it plans to starts selling the PlayStation 4 in
 North America  on Nov. 15.  The Topix  traded  at 1.17 times book value today, compared
with 2.43 for the S&P 500 and 1.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
