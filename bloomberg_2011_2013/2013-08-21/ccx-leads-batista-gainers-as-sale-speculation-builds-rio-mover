(Corrects name of company in second paragraph.)  CCX Carvao da Colombia SA , a mining
unit of former billionaire  Eike Batista , is leading gains among
his natural resources and logistics companies amid speculation
he has found more buyers for his companies.  CCX, as the smallest of Batista’s publicly-traded companies
is known, rose 20 percent to 1.54 reais at 11:50 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, the highest on a closing basis in more than a month. It
is leading Brazilian small-cap stocks and is up 59 percent in
the past three days. Batista’s shipbuilding unit  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) 
and his oil unit OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA also gained
5.7 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively.  EIG Global Energy Partners LLC’s 1.3 billion reais ($540
million) offer for part of  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , Batista’s port
operator, is driving speculation that the entrepreneur will also
find buyers for other assets to help cover investments and pay
off debts, Fabiano Santin, an analyst at Kondor Invest in Sao
Paulo, said by telephone. Batista is cutting costs and selling
stakes after production and profit missed targets, erasing more
than $33.5 billion of his fortune since March 2012.  “They announced the LLX partial sale, people are gaining
confidence he can divest some assets and raise more cash,” said
Santin, who covers the bonds of Batista-controlled companies.  CCX and EBX Group Co., Batista’s holding company, didn’t
immediately reply to e-mails requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
