Woolworths Ltd. (WOW) ,  Australia ’s largest
retailer, said it would buy womenswear and homewares store
EziBuy Holdings Ltd. for NZ$350 million ($275 million) as it
seeks to expand its home deliveries business.  EziBuy, which started sending out black and white  mail-order catalogs  to organizations picked from the phone book when
it was founded in the New Zealand town of Palmerston North in
1978, now makes 68 percent of its sales from Australia,
according to a regulatory statement from Woolworths.  Woolworths has been pushing to increase online sales, with
a 42 percent rise posted during the 12 months ended June
according to a transcript of a July 30 investor call. EziBuy has
expertise in that area and a “world-class distribution center”
for processing online orders, Woolworths said.  Home deliveries “will continue to provide Woolworths with
opportunities for growth and innovation,” Grant O’Brien, chief
executive officer, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
