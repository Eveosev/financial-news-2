News Corp. (NWSA) , publisher of the Wall
Street Journal, the  New York  Post and other newspapers around
the world, plans to create a private exchange for selling ad
space on its websites, breaking ties with third-party networks.  The service, which will debut in the coming weeks, will let
advertisers buy space on more than 50 websites, including the
online home of the Journal, the Post, the U.K.’s Times, the
Australian and MarketWatch.com, according to a statement today.  The move mirrors others by digital publishers, whose online
ad rates have been hurt by bidding exchanges capitalizing on an
overabundance of ad inventory. The Wall Street Journal already
had been using a private online exchange.  News Corp ., which was spun off from  Rupert Murdoch ’s more
lucrative entertainment assets in June, is seeking ways to wring
more revenue from online advertising. By eschewing third-party
services, the company can prevent its properties from becoming
commodities, Chief Executive Officer Robert Thomson said in the
statement.  “The only way to reach the world’s greatest content and
the most prestigious and lucrative audiences is directly through
our digital properties,” Thomson said. “Third parties are no
longer invited to the party.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
