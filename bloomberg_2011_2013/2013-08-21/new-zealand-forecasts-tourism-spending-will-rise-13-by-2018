New Zealand  predicted tourist
spending will increase 13 percent in the five years through
2018, buoyed by arrivals from  China .  Tourists will spend NZ$6.28 billion ($5 billion) in 2018,
up from an estimated NZ$5.54 billion this year, the Ministry for
Business, Innovation and Employment said in a  statement  on its
website. The 2018 forecast is little changed from the previous
projection of NZ$6.27 billion published in November.  Growth in New Zealandâ€™s tourism industry, which makes up
about 10 percent of the economy, is increasingly reliant on
China, which is the second-biggest source of spending after
Australia. Spending by Chinese visitors is forecast to surge 55
percent to NZ$1.12 billion by 2018.  Australian spending is forecast to rise to NZ$1.84 billion
by 2018, with visitor numbers lower than previously projected
because of slower economic growth, the ministry said. Australian
families are reluctant to visit the  South Island  after
earthquakes in 2010-11, and the strong Australian dollar makes
alternative destinations more appealing, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
