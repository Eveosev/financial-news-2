India ’s rupee plunged to a record on
concern the U.S. will pare stimulus as early as next month,
intensifying outflows and leaving the currency vulnerable to a
current-account deficit.  The rupee weakened 1.3 percent to 64.0450 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched an all-time low of 64.55 earlier. The
currency’s slump caused the benchmark stock index to erase gains
of as much as 1.8 percent. The Sensex dropped 1.9 percent to
17,905.91, the lowest close since Sept. 11. Benchmark 10-year
bonds rallied, pushing the yield down by the most in four years.  The Federal Open Market Committee publishes minutes of its
July meeting today, with 65 percent of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News predicting the Fed will taper bond purchases in
September. The rupee had briefly strengthened 0.2 percent
earlier after India’s central bank said late yesterday it will
start buying government debt to pump funds into markets and
consider reducing weekly sales of cash-management bills to rein
in a surge in bond yields that threatened the economy.  “We remain bearish on the rupee on concerns of lower
growth, Fed-tapering fears and weakening sentiment given general
elections next year,” Amit Agrawal, an analyst at Societe
Generale SA in Bangalore, wrote in a research report today. The
bank predicts the currency will fall to 66.25 per dollar by the
end of this year.  Cutting Holdings  Global funds have cut holdings of Indian debt by $10
billion since May 22, when Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first
flagged the potential tapering. The shortfall in India’s
current-account widened to a record 4.8 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ended March 31.  The rupee’s slump also pared today’s bond rally. The yield
on the benchmark 10-year bond ended at 8.42 percent after
falling as low as 8.30 percent.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, rose
65 basis points, or 0.65 percentage point, to 15.59 percent.  The RBI will buy 80 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) of bonds
through open-market operations on Aug. 23 and “thereafter
calibrate them both in terms of quantum and frequency” based on
market conditions, it said in a statement yesterday. Sales of
cash-management bills will be calibrated going forward,
“including scaling it down as may be necessary,” the monetary
authority said.  Last month, the RBI increased both the marginal standing
facility rate and the bank rate by 200 basis points to 10.25
percent. It tightened banks’ daily cash-reserve requirements and
drained money through securities offerings. The central bank
also cut its growth forecast for the year through March 2014 to
5.5 percent from 5.7 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 1.1 percent to
65.85 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts dropped 1.4 percent to 66.24. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
