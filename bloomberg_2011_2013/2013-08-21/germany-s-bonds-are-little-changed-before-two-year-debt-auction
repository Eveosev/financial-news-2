Spanish and Italian  government bonds 
fell for a third day as investors awaited the release of minutes
from the  Federal Reserve ’s July meeting for signals on when
policy makers will curtail monetary stimulus.  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed to the highest level in two
weeks after a newspaper reported that former Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi  threatened to withdraw his support from the
current government.  Germany ’s  bonds  fell after yields increased
at a sale of two-year notes.  Portugal ’s cost of borrowing for 12
months dropped as it auctioned 700 million euros ($937 million)
of bills after the government resolved a rift in the ruling
coalition last month.  “The focus of the market remains on the Fed minutes,”
said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “Tapering talk will
continue to push yields higher unless upcoming economic numbers
and the content of the minutes today change that view.”  Spain ’s 10-year yield climbed six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 4.53 percent at 4:18 p.m. London time after
rising 11 basis points during the previous two days. The 4.4
percent bond due in October 2023 dropped 0.46, or 4.60 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 98.99.  Similar-maturity Italian yields increased five basis points
to 4.36 percent after reaching 4.37 percent, the highest level
since Aug. 2.  ‘Important Driver’  The Fed will reduce its $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases at its next meeting on Sept. 17-18, according to 65
percent of economists in a Bloomberg survey conducted on Aug. 9-13. In a survey last month, half of the respondents predicted a
September reduction.  “The Fed minutes will be an important driver,” said
Alessandro Giansanti, a senior interest-rate strategist at ING
Bank NV in Amsterdam. “We are approaching the month of
September, where investors expect the beginning of the
tapering.”  Berlusconi said he would resign unless Prime Minister
Enrico Letta and his allies found a solution that will allow him
to remain in politics,  Corriere della Sera  reported. Letta said
today in Vienna he is confident internal political divisions can
be overcome.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
securities instead of benchmark bunds widened one basis point to
248 basis points after expanding to 252 basis points, the widest
since Aug. 9.  Bunds Fall  German bunds declined as the government allotted 4.09
billion euros of securities due in September 2015 at an average
yield of 0.23 percent, up from 0.07 percent on July 10, and the
 highest  for a two-year sale since March 2012.  Germany’s 10-year yield climbed four basis points to 1.88
percent after rising to 1.92 percent on Aug. 19, the most since
March 27, 2012. The yield on two-year notes maturing in June
2015 increased two basis points to 0.22 percent.  Economists say German data tomorrow will show gauges of
manufacturing and services improved this month. A manufacturing
index based on a survey of  purchasing managers  rose to 51.1 from
50.7 in July, while one for services rose to 51.7 from 51.3,
according to Bloomberg News surveys.  Portugal Auction  Portugal sold securities due in August 2014 at an average
yield of 1.619 percent, down from 1.72 percent at the previous
sale of similar-maturity bills on July 17. The government also
sold 300 million euros of three-month bills at an average yield
of 0.766 percent, versus 0.743 percent on April 17.  Portugal’s 12-month borrowing costs jumped to the highest
in nine months in July before President Anibal Cavaco Silva
endorsed Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho ’s plan to keep his
coalition government together.  The nation’s  10-year yield  increased 10 basis points to
6.44 percent.  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of the Netherlands and  Finland ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish securities returned 7.7 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy’s
earned 4.1 percent, while German bonds lost 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
