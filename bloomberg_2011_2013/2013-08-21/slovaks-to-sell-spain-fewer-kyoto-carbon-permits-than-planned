Slovakia will sell  Spain  fewer of
its surplus United Nations carbon-dioxide permits than
originally planned, the east European countryâ€™s  Environment
Ministry  said, without giving a reason.  A cabinet meeting in Bratislava today authorized selling
Assigned Amount Units representing 7 million tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent to Spain, ministry spokesman Maros Stano said
by phone. A November plan envisioned selling permits for at
least 22 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions.  Stano said the purchase price was confidential and the
government would hold talks with other potential buyers for the
remaining spare permits worth about 20 million tons of
emissions.  AAUs were distributed to nations based on the  Kyoto
Protocol , which set limits on greenhouse-gas emissions for the
period 2008 to 2012. A global economic slowdown since 2008 has
caused industrial production to stagnate, boosting the supply of
spare permits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
