DeNA Co. (2432)  and  Gree Inc. (3632) ,  Japan ’s
biggest social-game operators, slumped in Tokyo trading after
gamemakers led by  Sega Sammy Holdings Inc. (6460)  said they would team
up to promote each other’s titles for smartphones.  DeNA, operator of the Mobage network,  plunged  as much as
9.3 percent to 1,924 yen, headed for the biggest decline in more
than three months. Gree dropped as much as 7.5 percent.  Sega, creator of Sonic the Hedgehog, developed a system to
allow makers including  Capcom Co. (9697)  and  Taito Corp . to display
advertising of mobile app games by other members, Koji Ueda, a
Sega spokesman, said by phone today. The Nikkei newspaper
earlier today reported the alliance will allow the companies to
bypass platforms such as DeNA’s Mobage and Gree. Gamemakers pay
a commission to companies such as Gree and DeNA for games
accessed through their platforms.  “Overall, we view this as negative” for Gree and DeNA,
David Gibson, a Tokyo-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.,
said in a note today. “Developers continue to shift their
resources away and not use recently launched app marketing
initiatives announced by Gree/DeNA.”  DeNA  traded  at 1,949 yen, down by 8.1 percent, as of 1:14
p.m. in  Tokyo , extending its drop this year to 31 percent. Gree
traded at 838 yen and has lost 37 percent this year,  compared 
with a 30 percent advance for the broader Topix index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
