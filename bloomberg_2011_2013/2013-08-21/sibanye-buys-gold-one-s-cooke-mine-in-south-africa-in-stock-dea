Sibanye Gold Ltd. (SGL) , the South African
miner spun off from Gold Fields Ltd. this year, will acquire a
majority stake in  Gold One International Ltd. (GDO) ’s Cooke Operations
west of Johannesburg in an all-share transaction.  Sibanye will issue new shares accounting for 17 percent of
its total issued stock to Gold One, which is 90 percent owned by
a group of Chinese investors known as the BCX Consortium, it
said in a statement today. The 150 million shares Sibanye will
issue to Gold One were valued at about 1.5 billion rand ($148
million), based on yesterday’s close in Johannesburg.  “Gold One and its 90 percent shareholder, the Chinese BCX
Consortium, will be an anchor shareholder with a long-term
investment horizon, which will support Sibanye Gold’s long-term
growth strategy,” the company said in a regulatory filing.  South African gold miners are confronting an 18 percent
drop in the spot gold price this year and wage talks with labor
unions, which have rejected a 5 percent increase in salaries.
The  National Union of Mineworkers , which represents 64 percent
of gold miners, has called for a 61 percent jump in entry-level
salaries.  The Cooke operations target average production of 260,000
ounces of gold and 570,000 pounds of uranium in the next five
years, Sibanye said. The shares climbed 4 percent to 10.33 rand
by 9:20 a.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
