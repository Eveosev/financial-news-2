Rubber extended losses for a third
day as a sell-off in Asian stocks raised concern that regional
demand may weaken for the commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in January on  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange
dropped as much as 1.1 percent to 257.9 yen a kilogram ($2,652 a
metric ton), the lowest level for a most-active contract since
Aug. 9. Futures traded at 259.6 yen at 12:03 p.m. and have lost
14 percent this year.  Asia’s benchmark  stock  index fell for a fifth day to trade
at the lowest level in six weeks. Emerging market stocks were
roiled this week amid speculation capital outflows will
accelerate as the  Federal Reserve  is expected to curb bond-buying.  “A sell-off in Asian stocks sapped investor appetite for
rubber futures,” said Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker
ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo.  Investors will be watching the release of the Federal Open
Market Committee’s July meeting minutes today for hints as to
when the stimulus may be curbed.  Rubber for delivery in January was little changed at 19,485
 yuan  ($3,182) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.6 percent to 81.25 baht
($2.56) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
