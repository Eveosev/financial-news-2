Insurance Australia Group Ltd. (IAG) , the
nation’s biggest car and home insurer, reported full-year net
profit more than triple a year earlier as claims fell and
premiums rose.  Net income  rose to A$776 million ($697 million) in the year
ended June 30 from A$207 million a year earlier, the Sydney-based company said in a statement today. That compares with a
median  estimate  of A$819 million from a survey of seven analysts
by Bloomberg News. The company expects an insurance margin of
12.5 percent to 14.5 percent for the year to June 2014, it said.  IAG on July 17 raised its estimate of full-year net earned
premium and insurance profit margin, citing fewer natural peril
claims and higher investment income. IAG is gaining from Chief
Executive Officer Michael Wilkins’s decision in December to exit
the group’s ailing U.K. business and focus on operations in
Australia and Asia.  “Underlying margins are still improving but only
modestly,” James Coghill, a Sydney-based analyst at UBS AG,
said before the profit announcement. “A big lift is required
over the next 12 months to exceed FY14 expectations.”  The insurer will pay a final dividend of 25 Australian
cents a share, taking the full-year payout to 36 cents, it said
today.  IAG  shares  have climbed 26 percent this year  compared  with
a 10 percent rise for the  benchmark S&P/ASX200 index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
