Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT) , the
country’s third-largest bank by assets, said its Chief Executive
Officer Reuven Spiegel will step down in March 2014 due to
personal reasons.  Spiegel, who joined bank in 2001, was appointed CEO in
August 2010, and took the role in January 2011. He was
overseeing the implementation of a strategic program to improve
efficiencies at the bank, the statement said.  “It is surprising news,” Terence Klingman, head of
research at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by
phone today. “He is leaving in the midst of a process of
cutting costs and there is still work to be done.”  About 60 percent of operational expenses at Israeli banks
stem from salaries, the most of any country in the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development after Denmark and
compared with an average of 47 percent, according to  Bank of
Israel  data.  “I received with sadness the decision of Reuven to
leave,” Discount chairman Joseph Bachar said in the statement.
“His professional abilities were central to the success of the
group.” Discount  shares  have advanced 55 percent in the past 12
months, compared with a 33 percent rise in the  Tel Aviv  Banking
Index.  As most of the management team is relatively new at the
bank, the new CEO will probably have to come from outside,
Psagot’s Klingman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
