Australia  captain Michael Clarke won
the toss and opted to bat first in the fifth and final Ashes
cricket Test against England at the Oval in London. The toss-winning side chose to bat in every match of the series.  Australia made two changes to the team defeated in the last
Test at Chester-le-Street. James Faulkner makes his debut in
place of Usman Khawaja, while pace bowler Mitchell Starc gets
his third start of the series, replacing Jackson Bird.  England, which holds a 3-0 lead in the series, also made
two changes, handing Test debuts to all-rounder Chris Woakes and
spinner Simon Kerrigan in place of Jonny Bairstow and the
injured  Tim Bresnan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
