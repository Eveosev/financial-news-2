The Obama administration is
“working urgently” to gather information about reports that
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s used chemical weapons in
attacks near Damascus that left more than 1,000 people dead, the
White House said in a statement.  The U.S. is asking the  United Nations  to investigate the
allegation and “is deeply concerned” by the reports, deputy
press secretary  Josh Earnest  said. The administration is joining
calls from Britain and France for a United Nations probe. The UN
Security Council scheduled a meeting this afternoon on the
allegations.  The U.S. “strongly condemns any and all use of chemical
weapons,” Earnest said. “Those responsible for the use of
chemical weapons must be held accountable.”  The latest allegation that Assad’s regime used chemical
weapons comes a year after President  Barack Obama  said that
using such arms would be a “red line” that would prompt a
change in how the U.S. responds to the conflict in Syria.  “If the Syrian government has nothing to hide and is truly
committed to an impartial and credible investigation of chemical
weapons use in  Syria , it will facilitate the UN team’s immediate
and unfettered access to this site,” Earnest said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
