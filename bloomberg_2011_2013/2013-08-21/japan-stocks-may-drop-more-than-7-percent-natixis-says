Japanese stocks  may retreat more
than 7 percent in the next two weeks after breaking through a
key support level, before rallying almost 20 percent by year-end, according to a technical analyst at Natixis.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell below the 13,430 support
level yesterday, a sign the gauge will experience a short-term
downward trend, Ouri Mimran said in a telephone interview from
Paris. He also said that if the index remains above a subsequent
support level of 12,415, the Nikkei could rally 19 percent by
the end of 2013.  “The gauge is in a short-term bearish channel from its
July top,” Mimran said. “Our next target for the Nikkei is the
support level of 12,415,” implying a 7.5 percent retreat from
today’s close. “Holding above that level would then trigger an
interesting bullish signal that would last until year-end, to
about 15,940, as it would signal the end of the long
consolidation phase that started in May.”  The Nikkei 225 fell to 13,424.33 today. Japanese shares
have posted the biggest rally this year of 24 developed markets
tracked by Bloomberg amid optimism that record stimulus by the
 Bank of Japan  and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic reforms
will boost growth. The gauge has still slumped 14 percent since
its high on May 22, as the yen strengthened and Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank’s pace of bond
buying will slow if the economy improves in line with forecasts.  Breaking through the resistance level of 13,900 next week
would invalidate the bearish scenario, Mimran said.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a stock, commodity,
currency or index. Analysts identify resistance levels, or
ceilings limiting further gains, and supports, which act as
floors in a declining market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
