Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed a sixth day after a government report showed output of
the fuel slumped to a three-week low.  The spread, or price difference, tightened 3.65 cents to
64.17 cents a gallon after the Energy Information Administration
said  production  last week fell 1.5 percent to 844,000 barrels a
day, the lowest level since July 26.  “We’re firm,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at Intl
FCStone in Des Moines,  Iowa . “We continue to draw down
production a little bit. We’re in that time of year in between
old-crop and new-crop corn, where plants may take some downtime
for maintenance.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery advanced 4.7
cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.296 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have gained 4.8 percent this year.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 1.05 cents to $2.9377
a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 92 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Aug. 16, down from 94
percent the previous period, data from the EIA, the Energy
Department’s analytical arm, show.  The additive is made from corn in the U.S. Blackford said
tight supplies of the grain before next month’s harvest may
prompt companies to reduce operations.  Corn Supplies  Corn inventories will be 27 percent lower than a year
earlier before the harvest, according to U.S. Agriculture
Department estimates.  Corn for September delivery jumped 14.25 cents, or 3
percent, to $4.98 a bushel in  Chicago . The more actively traded
December contract added 7.75 cents to $4.8325.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts, was 49 cents, unchanged from yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol  stockpiles  gained 0.4 percent to 16.5 million
barrels, today’s EIA report showed, while imports sank 47
percent to 19,000 barrels a day.  Gasoline demand over four weeks  was 2 percent above the
same period a year ago, the EIA said. That should lead to higher
ethanol prices, said Michael Breitenbach, a broker and director
of research at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York.  “The continuing presence of gasoline demand numbers this
summer could perhaps represent the beginning of a trend and is
supportive of the view that the U.S. economy is experiencing a
nascent return to growth,” he said.  Ethanol RINs  The government uses tracking certificates, known as
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, to determine
compliance with mandates to use the fuel.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  slid 1 cent to 75 cents while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, decreased 2 cents to 82 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York advanced 9
cents to $2.58 a gallon; in the U.S. Gulf, prices increased 5.5
cents to $2.48; on the West Coast, ethanol added 5 cents to
$2.58; and in Chicago, the biofuel gained 4.5 cents to $2.38 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor expanded 4.5 cents to
20 cents, while the West Coast’s premium to the Gulf slimmed 0.5
cents to 10 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
