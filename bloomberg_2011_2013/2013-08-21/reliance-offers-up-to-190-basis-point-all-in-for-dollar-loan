Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator
of the world’s biggest oil refinery complex, is offering an all-in rate of as much as 190 basis points for a U.S. dollar-denominated loan, two people familiar with the matter said.  The company plans to pay the interest and fees on a $500
million five-year portion of the borrowing, and an all-in rate
of 175 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate
on a $1.2 billion 6 1/2-year tranche, the people said, asking
not to be identified because the details are private. The latter
will be used to refinance debt, the people said.  Reliance Industries’ billionaire Chairman  Mukesh Ambani 
told shareholders in June that he plans to spend 1.5 trillion
rupees ($24 billion) over the next three years to expand
businesses ranging from gas to telecommunications. The company
has the equivalent of about $20.1 billion in bonds and loans
outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tushar Pania, a Mumbai-based spokesman for Reliance,
couldn’t immediately be reached to comment on the company’s
financing plans.  Some 18 banks will be involved in the $1.7 billion
financing, the people said today. Some of the proceeds will also
be used for capital expenditure, they said.  The $1.2 billion facility may be drawn in U.S. and
Singapore dollars, euros and Japanese yen, and proceeds will
help to refinance $1.2 billion of multicurrency loans signed in
2008, two people said July 31.  Some of the debt the company is seeking to refinance is
paying an interest margin of 130 basis points more than Libor,
Bloomberg-compiled data show.  Reliance Industries shares fell 0.9 percent to 818.15
rupees as of 1:06 p.m. in Mumbai.  To contact the reporters on this story:
