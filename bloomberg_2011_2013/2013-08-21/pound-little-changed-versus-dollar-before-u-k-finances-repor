The pound was little changed versus
the dollar and  euro  before a report that economists said will
show U.K.’s public finances improved in July.  Sterling was about 0.2 percent from a two-month high
against the U.S. currency. The U.K. government’s  budget surplus 
excluding temporary support for banks was 2.9 billion pounds
($4.54 billion) last month, compared with a surplus of 1.6
billion pounds a year earlier, according to the median estimate
of 24 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  The pound traded at $1.5668 at 7:25 a.m. London time after
advancing to $1.5696 yesterday, the highest level since June 18.
Sterling was at 85.62 pence per euro.  The U.K. currency has gained 5.3 percent in the past six
months, the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose
4.1 percent and the dollar strengthened 2.2 percent.  Gilts lost investors 4.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
bonds dropped 2.1 percent and Treasuries declined 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
