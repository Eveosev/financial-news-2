Ousted Politburo member  Bo Xilai ’s
corruption and abuse-of-power trial in the eastern Chinese city
of Jinan will be broadcast live to journalists in a nearby
hotel, Phoenix Television reported.  The court arranged for the broadcast and will file updates
about the trial on its microblog account,  Phoenix reported  last
night, citing an unidentified official from the Taiwan Affairs
Office of Shandong province, where Jinan is located.  A woman who answered the information hotline given to
journalists for Bo’s trial, which is set to begin tomorrow, said
she hadn’t received any notice about a live broadcast. Three
calls to the Shandong Taiwan Affairs Office rang unanswered
today.  Bo’s trial will bring  China ’s biggest political crisis
since the 1989  Tiananmen Square  protests a step closer to its
conclusion. He faces bribery and corruption charges dating back
to his time as mayor of Dalian in the 1990s, while the abuse-of-power charge is believed connected to the 2011 killing of a
British businessman in Chongqing when Bo was Communist Party
secretary there.  Bo’s wife Gu Kailai was convicted last year of murdering
the businessman, Neil Heywood, and was given a suspended death
sentence.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
