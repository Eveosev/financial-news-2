Basilea Pharmaceutica AG (BSLN) , a Swiss
developer of an antibiotic to treat pneumonia, fell the most in
two months after the company said U.S. regulators want two
trials of the drug before they consider granting approval.  Basilea shares fell as much as 7.7 percent, the steepest
intraday drop since June 20, and were down 5.9 percent at 74.15
Swiss francs as of 1:19 p.m. in Zurich. Before today the stock
 gained  93 percent this year, including reinvested dividends,
compared with the Swiss Performance Index’s 19 percent advance.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has indicated that
its guidelines requiring two trials of a drug in each disease
for which a company seeks approval are still valid, Basel,
Switzerland-based Basilea said in a statement today. The company
said it’s continuing its discussions with the agency and may
receive approval in Europe for the drug this year.  “We are concerned that the FDA is persevering with its
guidance of requesting two trials per pneumonia indication,”
