Treasuries dropped, pushing 30-year
yields to a two-year high, after minutes of the  Federal
Reserve ’s last meeting showed policy makers were “broadly
comfortable” with a plan to curtail bond purchases.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes approached the highest in
two years as the minutes showed Fed officials supported Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to start reducing stimulus under
quantitative easing later this year if the economy improves,
with a few saying it might be needed soon. U.S.-registered bond
funds lost $30.3 billion in August, a private report said.  “It does appear the markets are continuing to expect
tapering,” said  James Camp , managing director of fixed income
in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida , at Eagle Asset Management Inc.,
which oversees $27.8 billion. “The Fed wants out of QE. In the
near-term we see a 3 percent handle.”  The Treasury 30-year bond yield climbed seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.92 percent at 4:59 p.m. in  New
York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It was the
highest level since August 2011. The price of the 3.625 percent
security due in August 2043 sank 1 1/8, or $11.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 94 26/32.  Ten-year yields  increased eight basis points to 2.89
percent after advancing on Aug. 19 to 2.90 percent, the highest
since July 2011.  “Almost all committee members agreed that a change in the
purchase program was not yet appropriate,” and a few said “it
might soon be time to slow somewhat the pace of purchases as
outlined in that plan,” according to the record of the Federal
Open Market Committee’s July 30-31 policy session released today
in  Washington .  Higher Volume  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , jumped 38 percent to $359
billion, the highest level since Aug. 15. The figure is down
from a 2013 high of $662 billion reached on May 22 and up from a
low of $148 billion on Aug. 9. The 2013 average is $313 billion.  Volatility as measured by the Merrill Lynch Option
Volatility Estimate MOVE Index rose to 98.79, above the 2013
average of 68.5.  Fed policy makers next meet Sept. 17-18. They probably will
vote to trim the stimulus program, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg between Aug. 9-13.  “The  bond market  is selling off, as there was no bond-friendly news from the minutes,” said Donald Ellenberger, who
oversees about $10 billion as co-head of government and
mortgage-backed securities at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.
“There wasn’t a very dovish discussion, it seems.”  Yield Increase  Ten-year note yields have jumped about 30 basis points
this month on speculation the  U.S. economy  is strong enough to
prompt the central bank to slow stimulus as soon as next month.  “The Fed minutes were in line with expectations,” said
Karim Basta, chief investment strategist and director of
economic research at III Associates, a hedge fund that
specializes in global fixed income, with more than $2 billion
under management. “The most important message to come from the
Fed minutes was that the higher yields we’ve seen have not
materially changed their outlook on the economy.”  The FOMC affirmed a pledge on July 31 to continue bond
buying until seeing signs “the outlook for the labor market has
improved substantially.” While employers in July expanded
payrolls by 162,000 workers, the least in four months, the
jobless rate fell to 7.4 percent, the lowest level since 2008,
according to Labor Department data.  Treasury losses this month are being matched by declines in
mortgage-backed securities as the Fed prepares to reduce
purchases of both securities.  Bond Funds  U.S. sovereign and mortgage bonds have fallen 0.9 percent
in August as of yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. While both declined in May, June and July,
Treasuries dropped more each time. Thirty-year fixed mortgage
 rates  rose to 4.59 percent this week, approaching the highest
level since May 2011, according to Bankrate.com.  Treasuries have lost investors 3.54 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond  Index. (BUSY)   U.S.-registered bond mutual and exchange-traded funds lost
$30.3 billion to investor redemptions this month, putting them
on track for their slowest year since 2004, according to data
from TrimTabs Investment Research.  The withdrawals for the month through Aug. 19 are already
the third-highest on record, following $69.1 billion of
withdrawals in June and $42 billion in October 2008, according
to a report dated yesterday from TrimTabs, of Sausalito,
 California . Bond funds have suffered $4 billion in redemptions
this year, on pace for the biggest withdrawals since investors
pulled $7 billion in 2004.  Gross Posting  Bill Gross , Pacific Investment Management Co.’s founder and
co-chief investment officer, said the conclusion of quantitative
easing will end bull markets.  “No more QE’s? No more bull markets,” Gross wrote in a
posting on Twitter.  Treasury yields rose earlier as data showed sales of
previously owned U.S. homes climbed in July.  Purchases advanced 6.5 percent to a 5.39 million annual
rate last month, beating the 5.15 million median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, figures from the National
Association of Realtors showed today in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
