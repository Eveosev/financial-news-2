Pakistan Petroleum Ltd., the
nation’s second-biggest energy explorer, said full-year profit
rose 2.5 percent as production from its domestic fields
increased and the rupee depreciated against the  U.S. dollar .  Standalone  net income  was 42 billion rupees ($406 million),
or 25.53 rupees a share, in the 12 months ended June, compared
with 40.9 billion rupees, or 24.91 rupees a share, a year
earlier, the Karachi-based company said in a filing today. Sales
rose to 102 billion rupees, from 96 billion rupees.  Output increased by 12 percent to about 9,700 barrels of
oil per day, Muhammad Affan Ismail, an analyst at BMA Capital
Management Ltd. in Karachi, wrote in an Aug. 15 note to clients.
The depreciation of the Pakistani rupee, which fell 5 percent
against the dollar in the 12-month period according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, also helped boost profit, he wrote.  Pakistani explorers sell oil to refiners such as National
Refinery Ltd., Pakistan Refinery Ltd. and Attock Refinery Ltd.
at prices that are linked with the international market. Gas is
sold to the country’s two utilities Sui Southern Gas Co. and Sui
Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd.  Pakistan Petroleum declined 3 percent to 243.33 rupees at
the close in Karachi trading. The company will pay a final cash
dividend of 5.50 rupees on each share and give one free share
for every 5 held, it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
