William Cruger, an investment banker
focused on securities industry deals for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
has left the firm, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  Cruger left in June, the person said, asking not to
identified because his plans are not public. The Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority Inc.’s  website  shows he is no
longer with the New York-based firm. Cruger was registered as an
employee of JPMorgan since 1997, the website shows.  Cruger, who advised Raymond James Financial Inc. on its
$930 million purchase of Morgan Keegan & Co. from Regions
Financial Corp. last year, is the second senior adviser to
exchanges and other securities businesses to leave JPMorgan
recently. His colleague Joseph Molluso has left to join
electronic trading firm Virtu Financial LLC, the person said.  Justin Perras , a spokesman at JPMorgan, declined to comment
on the departures. Cruger, Molluso and officials at closely held
Virtu couldn’t immediately be reached.  The departure of Molluso, who had been with JPMorgan since
2006, was reported by the Wall Street Journal this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
