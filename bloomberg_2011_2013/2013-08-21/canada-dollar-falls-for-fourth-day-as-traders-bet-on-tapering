The Canadian dollar dropped to a
six-week low after after Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed
officials in broad agreement to start tapering bond purchases
later this year.  Canada ’s currency fell for a fourth day, the longest
decline since June, as the minutes pointed to consensus on an
exit from record stimulus that had fueled demand for riskier
assets. Fed officials were “broadly comfortable” with Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to start reducing bond buying later this
year if the economy improves, with a few saying tapering might
be needed soon, minutes of their last meeting show.  “Now that some of the uncertainty around the Fed is
removed, pent-up cash is finding its way into the  U.S. dollar ,”
Adam Button, a currency analyst at forexlive.com, said by phone
from  Montreal . “The commodity bloc in general is vulnerable and
that will weigh on the Canadian dollar. At the moment, the story
is purely dollar strength.”  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is nicknamed for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.8 percent to
C$1.0474 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto after touching
C$1.0483, the weakest level since July 10. One Canadian dollar
buys 95.48 U.S. cents.  Benchmark  10-year (GCAN10YR)  government bonds fell, pushing yields up
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.75 percent,
approaching the two-year high of 2.76 percent on Aug. 19. The
price of the 1.5 percent securities maturing in June 2023
dropped 58 cents to C$89.35.  The  Bank of Canada  auctioned C$3.3 billion ($3.2 billion)
of two-year bonds at an average yield of 1.271 percent. The sale
drew C$9.38 billion of bids, for a bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge
of demand, of 2.84. The 1 percent debt matures in November 2015.  September Taper  Fed policy makers will probably reduce monthly purchases at
their Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of 48
economists in an Aug. 9-13 Bloomberg survey. The median estimate
called for a cut to $75 billion each month.  “We believe the Fed will start to taper in September and
therefore we do expect the Canadian dollar to weaken down to
C$1.06, C$1.07 in the next month or two,” Blake Jespersen,
managing director of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal, said
by phone from Toronto before the Fed minutes were released.  Canada’s currency will depreciate to C$1.05 by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 62 economists and analysts.  Oil Drops  Futures on crude oil declined for a third day after sliding
2 percent yesterday, the most since June 20. They fell 1 percent
today to $103.86 a barrel in  New York , the lowest since Aug. 9,
after reaching a 16-month high of $109.32 in July.  “It seems the bounce we’ve had in commodity currencies has
generally not proved very robust and has already turned
around,”  Adam Cole , head of Group of 10 currency strategy at
Royal Bank of Canada, said by phone from  London . “It’s all
wrapped up in Fed expectations.”  Implied volatility for three-month options on the Canadian
dollar versus its U.S. counterpart rose to 7.68 percent in its
fourth daily gain, the longest stretch of increases since June
24. Implied volatility is used to set option prices and gauge
the expected pace of currency swings. The average for this year
is 6.8 percent.  Statistics Canada  will report tomorrow that retail sales in
June fell 0.4 percent after a gain of 1.9 percent in May,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The nation’s
 wholesale sales  dropped 2.8 percent in June, data showed
yesterday, versus a forecast in a Bloomberg survey for a 0.5
percent decline.  Canadian consumer prices increased less than the central
bank’s 2 percent inflation target in July for a 15th straight
month, a separate survey forecast that an Aug. 23 government
report will say. The  consumer price index  advanced 1.4 percent
from a year earlier, from 1.2 percent the prior month,
economists in the survey estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
