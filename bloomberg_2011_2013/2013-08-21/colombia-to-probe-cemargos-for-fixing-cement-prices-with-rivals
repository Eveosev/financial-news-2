Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS) ,  Colombia ’s
largest cement maker, faces a probe of allegations it conspired
with rivals to fix prices over the past three years, the
country’s industry regulator said today.  The Superintendency of Industry and Commerce has opened an
investigation of five cement companies including Medellin-based
Cemargos for “an alleged agreement to fix prices and divide up
the market,” according to an e-mailed statement from the
regulator. Colombia has been monitoring “sustained and
unjustified” increases in cement prices since 2010, the
superintendency said.  Cemex Colombia, a unit of Bogota-based  Cemex Latam Holdings
SA (CLH) , is included in the probe, as are Holcim (Colombia) SA,
Cementos Tequendama SAS and Cementos San Marcos SA, according to
the statement.  The regulator will examine whether 14 people including
Cemargos Chief Executive Officer Jorge Mario Velasquez and Cemex
Latam’s Carlos Jacks collaborated, facilitated, authorized or
implemented anti-competitive practices, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
