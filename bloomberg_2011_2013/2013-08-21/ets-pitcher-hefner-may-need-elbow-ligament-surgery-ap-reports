New York  Mets right-handed pitcher
Jeremy Hefner may need surgery to replace a ligament in his
elbow, the Associated Press reported.  Hefner, 27, was placed on the disabled list after
complaining of a sore elbow all season.  A doctor for the Major League Baseball team has recommended
that Hefner undergo ligament replacement surgery, known as Tommy
John surgery, AP said. Hefner may seek a second opinion about
the procedure, which requires a year of recovery.  Hefner is 4-8 this season with a 4.34 earned run average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
