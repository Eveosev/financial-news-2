Mr Price Group Ltd., (MPC)  a South African
clothing and furniture retailer, rallied the most in three weeks
after sales growth in the four months through Aug. 3 kept pace
with last year even as  consumer spending  slowed.  The  stock rose  as much as 2.8 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since July 31, and traded 1.2 percent higher at 126.91 rand
as of 4:32 p.m. in Johannesburg. Almost 2.7 million shares
traded, or 3.3 times the three-month daily average.  Total sales for the 18 weeks advanced 14 percent, compared
with 14.9 percent in the corresponding period a year ago. South
African retailers including  Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  have reported
a decline in revenue growth as household budgets have tightened
and personal debt levels rose.  “While the current credit environment in  South Africa 
remains challenging, the group is satisfied that the initiatives
undertaken last year to reduce credit sales growth have not
negatively impacted overall sales growth,” the Durban, South
Africa-based company said in a statement.  Cash sales, which make up 79 percent of total revenue, rose
14.1 percent. That compares with credit sales growth of 13.7
percent. The clothing division, which accounts for almost three
quarters of total sales, climbed 14.8 percent, in line with
growth in the year-earlier period.  South African  retail sales  rose at the slowest pace in nine
months in June as rising  joblessness  and bad debt weighed on
spending. The number of South Africans with impaired credit
records rose by 189,000 to 9.53 million in the first quarter,
the National Credit Regulator said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
