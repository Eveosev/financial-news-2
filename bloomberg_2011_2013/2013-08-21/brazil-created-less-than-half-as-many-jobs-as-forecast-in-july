Brazil ’s economy in July created
less than half the jobs economists had forecast as accelerating
inflation damps business confidence in the world’s second-largest emerging market.  Brazil   registered  41,463 new formal jobs in July, the
lowest for the month in a decade, the Labor Ministry said today
in a report posted on its website. The result was the worst for
any month since January and below estimates of all 15 analysts
polled by Bloomberg. Their median forecast was for 100,000 new
posts.  “Some slowdown was expected, but this number was really
bad,” Jose Goncalves, chief economist at Banco Fator SA, said
by phone. “It’s a confirmation of deceleration and the delicate
situation of the economy.”  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is working to
spur economic growth while offsetting inflation that may be
stoked by a weaker real. Policy makers will continue to boost
borrowing costs after raising them by a total of 125 basis
points in the past three meetings, according to traders in the
 interest-rate swaps  market.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015, the most
traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose 13 basis points to 10.39 percent
at 3:16 p.m. local time. The real fell 1.6 percent to 2.4334 per
 U.S. dollar , and has weakened 15.7 percent this year.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15  price index  rose
0.16 percent from July 13 to Aug. 13, the national statistics
agency said in a report published on its website today. That
exceeded the median forecast of a 0.15 percent increase from
economists surveyed by Bloomberg and was more than double the
0.07 percent inflation rate in mid-July.  Growth Forecasts  Gross domestic product expanded 0.9 percent last year, the
worst performance since 2009. Analysts surveyed weekly by the
central bank have cut 2013 economic growth forecasts by more
than one percentage point so far this year.  Industrial confidence in August fell 2 points from the
previous year to 52.5, the National Industry Confederation said
Aug. 16 on its website. The survey polls about 2,300 companies.  Latin America ’s largest economy created 1,545 retail and
wholesale jobs in July, compared to 22,847 new posts a year ago,
according to Labor Ministry statistics. Brazil generated 7,154
manufacturing jobs and 4,899 construction jobs, down from 24,718
and 25,433 new posts a year ago.  The government’s job creation number is a balance of posts
created minus job eliminated. Registered jobs, so-called formal
work, assure employees a range of benefits such as  unemployment
insurance , bonuses and retirement payments by the government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
