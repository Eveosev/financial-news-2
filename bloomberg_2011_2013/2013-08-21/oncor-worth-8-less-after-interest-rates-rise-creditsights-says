The unit of Energy Future Holdings
Corp. that controls its regulated business is worth 8 percent
less now than in May because of rising  interest rates , according
to CreditSights Inc. analysts  Andy DeVries  and  Charles Johnston .  “Higher interest rates have driven down the value of all
yield-oriented investments, including utilities,” reducing the
value of Energy Future Intermediate Holding Co., whose “sole
asset” is 80.25 percent of power-line business Oncor Electric
Delivery, to $6.7 billion from $7.3 billion, the analysts wrote
in a report today.  As the  Federal Reserve  weighs unwinding unprecedented
stimulus that’s supported markets for more than four years, the
10-year Treasury  yield , a benchmark for interest rates, climbed
to 2.89 percent at 3:53 p.m. in New York from 1.63 in May. That
pushed borrowing costs on company debt higher, providing an
alternative to utility stocks that  yield  about 4.2 percent.  The updated valuation “shows the $1.5 billion unsecured
bonds are impaired by 10-15 percent versus 5 percent in our last
report,” they wrote. Asset coverage in the second-lien bonds
has fallen to 1.1 times from 1.2 times. “We continue to
recommend investors wait for a negative event at EFH or EFIH
before buying these bonds.”  The former TXU Corp. is seeking to restructure at least $32
billion of obligations as it struggles under debt acquired since
it was taken private by KKR & Co. and TPG Capital six years ago
in the largest leveraged buyout in history.  Allan Koenig , a spokesman for the Dallas-based power
company, declined to comment on the CreditSights report.  Energy Future  reported  a $71 million loss for the three
months ended June 30, its 10th straight unprofitable quarter.
Wholesale electricity rates have dropped as natural gas prices
declined about 75 percent from a July 2008 high.  EFIH’s 10 percent first-lien bonds due in December 2020,
which traded as high as 117 cents on the dollar in May, fell to
105.25 to yield 8.73 percent at 10:36 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
