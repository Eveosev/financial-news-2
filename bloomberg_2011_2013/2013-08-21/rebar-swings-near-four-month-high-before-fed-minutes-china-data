Steel reinforcement-bar futures
swung between gains and losses ahead of trade data from  China ,
the biggest user, and minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last
meeting that may provide clues on the pace of stimulus.  Rebar for January delivery traded little changed at 3,798
 yuan  ($620) a metric ton at 10:49 a.m. local time after swinging
between 3,790 yuan and 3,807 yuan. The contract reached a four-month high at 3,848 yuan on Aug. 14.  Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s July 30-31
meeting due today may hint at when policy makers plan to taper
the $85 billion of monthly bond purchases. The Beijing-based
Customs General Administration will announce data today for July
imports and exports of non-ferrous metals.  “Investors tried to gauge domestic and global
situations,” said Dang Man, an analyst at Make Futures Co. in
Xi’an. “Rebar will consolidate at the current level near a key
support at 3,800 yuan.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port lost 0.1
percent yesterday to $139 a dry ton, according to a price index
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  The  average spot  price of rebar rose for a 12th day
yesterday, adding 0.6 percent to 3,641 yuan a ton, the highest
since April, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
