Carbon permits rose on the Shenzhen
Emissions Exchange, the first of seven trial markets in  China ,
to a price exceeding those in Europe, according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  Shenzhen carbon allowances for 2013 increased to 43  yuan 
($7) a metric ton yesterday, up from 28 to 32 yuan a ton on June
18, the first day of trading, said Charlie Cao, a Beijing-based
analyst for New Energy Finance.  “Those trades show that at least some companies are
increasingly serious about carbon trading,” he said.  Shenzhen’s new cap and trade market includes about 635
companies. It traded 21,112 tons of carbon in eight transactions
valued at 613,236 yuan on June 18, according to a video
presentation at the opening ceremony. China’s seven CO2 markets,
including  Shanghai , Beijing, Guangdong, Tianjin, Chongqing and
Hubei, are set to regulate 800 million to 1 billion tons of
emissions by 2015 in the world’s biggest cap- and-trade program
after Europe’s, New Energy Finance forecasts.  While trading volume is low in Shenzhen, its carbon price
is 20 percent higher than European Union futures for December,
Cao said. EU allowances settled yesterday at 4.36 euros ($5.85),
down 7.2 percent from June 18, on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London .  The Shenzhen exchange had no carbon trades in July, and
volume ranged from 500 to 7,000 tons from Aug. 5 to Aug. 10, Cao
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
