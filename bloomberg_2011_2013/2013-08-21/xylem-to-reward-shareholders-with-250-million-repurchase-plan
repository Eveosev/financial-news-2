Xylem Inc. (XYL)  authorized a $250
million, three-year share repurchase program, saying the water
technology company was rewarding stockholders for its “strong
cash-generation.”  The  White Plains , N.Y.-based company spun off in 2011 by
ITT Corp. also declared a quarterly dividend of 11.64 cents a
share, unchanged from the previous three-month payout.  Prudent spending and “strong cash-generation” allows
Xylem to use capital in a way that benefits shareowners and
“maintains our focus on growth,” Chief Executive Officer
Gretchen McClain said in the statement.  Xylem shares have declined 3.3 percent over the past year
compared with a 1.9 percent gain by the 19-member Bloomberg
World Water Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
