Junk-rated corporate bonds  slumped 
for a fourth day in Europe, paring the longest rally in eight
months as investors await more clarity on the Federal Reserve’s
timing for tapering stimulus.  Bonds from companies including  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  and
 Italcementi SpA (IT)  lost an average 0.45 cents on the euro since
Aug. 14 to reach 143.96 cents yesterday, according to Bloomberg
bond  index  data. That’s after they increased 1.8 cents during a
near three-week rising streak, the longest stretch of gains
since December, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
