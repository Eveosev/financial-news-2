Portugal ’s cost of borrowing for 12
months dropped as it sold 700 million euros ($938 million) of
bills after the government resolved a rift in the ruling
coalition last month.  The nation auctioned securities due in August 2014 at an
average yield of 1.619 percent, down from 1.72 percent at the
previous sale of similar-maturity bills on July 17. The auction
attracted bids for 2.2 times the amount offered, versus a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.8 times last month, the Lisbon-based debt
management agency said.  The government also sold 300 million euros of three-month
bills at an average yield of 0.766 percent, versus 0.743 percent
on April 17. Bidding dropped to 3.4 times from 4.8 times.  Portugal’s 12-month borrowing costs climbed to the highest
in nine months in July before President Anibal Cavaco Silva
endorsed Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho ’s plan to keep his
coalition government together. The country sold 10-year debt in
May for the first time in more than two years as part of efforts
to regain full  market access  following its bailout in 2011.  The nation plans to resume regular issuance of bonds “only
if market conditions are conducive,” the debt agency said on
July 12. Financing needs for 2013 are “fully covered” and in
the second quarter the debt agency started to “pre-fund” for
borrowing needs in 2014, according to the agency.  Two-year notes rose today, while 10-year securities
declined. The two-year yield dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.66 percent at 1:17 p.m. in  London . The
 10-year yield  increased seven basis points to 6.41 percent.  The 10-year rate climbed to a seven-month high of 8.11
percent on July 3 after Foreign Affairs Minister Paulo Portas
said he quit the government in protest at its budget policy.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, said on Aug. 16 the
total indicative amount for today’s auctions was between 750
million euros and 1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
