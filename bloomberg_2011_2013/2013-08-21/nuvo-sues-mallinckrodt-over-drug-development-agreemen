Mallinckrodt Inc. was sued in
federal court and accused by its business partner  Nuvo Research
Inc. (NRI)  of violating an agreement over  drug development . Nuvo is
seeking $100 million in damages.  Nuvo, based in Misissauga, Canada, contends St. Louis-based
Mallinckrodt was given a U.S. license for the anti-inflammatory
arthritis knee-pain medicine  Pennsaid  and failed to make
milestone payments or conduct required clinical trials,
according to court papers filed yesterday in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan.  “We are disappointed that we have had to initiate legal
proceedings against Mallinckrodt,” John London, Nuvo’s
president and co-chief executive officer, said in a statement.
The company’s board took legal action “to protect the interests
of Nuvo and its shareholders,” he said.  Mallinckrodt doesn’t comment on pending litigation, Lynn
Philips, media relations manager, said in a telephone interview.  The case is Nuvo Research Inc. v. Mallinckrodt Inc., 13-cv-05831, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
