Mexico’s peso fell to its lowest
level in eight weeks on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve
will signal in minutes of its last policy meeting when it will
begin reducing stimulus.  The currency slumped 1.3 percent to 13.1497 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:12 a.m. in Mexico City, the weakest on a closing basis
since June 26. The drop was the biggest among 16 major dollar
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg after  Norway ’s krone. Yields
on peso-denominated debt due in 2024 increased five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.30 percent.  “The market has been discounting that in September they’ll
taper, so if this is confirmed, it could weaken a little bit
more,” Eduardo Rodriguez, a trader at Casa de Bolsa Finamex
SAB, said in a phone interview from Guadalajara, Mexico.  The Fed may cut monthly asset purchases in September by $10
billion to $75 billion, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The stimulus, which has kept
the U.S. target lending rate at virtually zero, helped boost
foreign holdings of fixed-rate peso bonds to a record in May.  Mexico ’s retail sales fell 1.9 percent in June from a year
earlier, the national statistics agency reported today. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
decrease of 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
