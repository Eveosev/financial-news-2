Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S.
home lender, will eliminate 2,300 jobs in mortgage production
because demand for refinancings has slumped and probably will
drop more as interest rates rise.  Other smaller cuts were made in the past few weeks around
the country, said people with knowledge of the matter, who asked
for anonymity because the changes haven’t been publicly
disclosed. The reductions would equal about 20 percent of the
firm’s  11,406  mortgage loan officers employed as of March 31.  Wells Fargo has said  mortgage lending  will slow for the
rest of this year as higher interest rates make refinancing less
attractive. Those loans, which made up 70 percent of the
mortgage market during the first half, slid to about 50 percent
of applications recently and could fall further in coming
months, Franklin Codel, head of mortgage production for the San
Francisco-based bank, said in a memo to staff yesterday.  “We’ve had to recalibrate  our business  to meet customers’
needs -- and to ensure we’re operating as efficiently and
effectively as possible,” Codel wrote. “Unfortunately,
displacements within our team are necessary.”  Quarterly mortgage originations will drop to less than $100
billion in the third quarter, spurring the lender to adjust the
size of its staff, Chief Financial Officer Timothy Sloan said
during the bank’s second-quarter earnings conference call. The
company made $112 billion mortgages in the three months ended
June 30.  Largest Employer  Wells Fargo was the largest  employer  among U.S. banks at
midyear with about 274,000 people. The workers whose positions
are being cut received 60 days’ notice yesterday and the firm is
seeking to retain as many as possible by placing them in other
jobs, said Jennifer A. Temple, a company spokeswoman.  Wells Fargo fell 0.5 percent to $42.36 in New York
yesterday. The shares climbed 24 percent this year through
yesterday, outpacing the  20 percent advance  for the 81-company
Standard & Poor’s Financials Index.  The interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate home loan soared
a record 35 percent in the 10 weeks ended July 11 to reach a
two-year high of 4.51 percent, according to data compiled by
Freddie Mac. The benchmark gauge for home financing was 4.4
percent last week, compared with a record-low 3.31 percent in
November.  Rate Impact  As rates have risen, so-called refis have slowed and Wells
Fargo has redoubled efforts to boost lending in the market for
home purchases. Former University of Notre Dame football coach
Lou Holtz attended an April event to help Wells Fargo woo real-estate agents and drum up customers. The company also has worked
to shorten the time it takes to complete each loan.  “Our focus on purchase business and strengthening our
Realtor and builder partnerships is helping us build momentum in
local markets,” wrote Codel, who reports to Michael Heid, head
of the bank’s mortgage business.  Mortgages typically are divided into those for refinancing
existing loans and for home purchases. While refis are mainly
tied to the level of interest rates, purchase mortgages are tied
to home-sale activity.  Heid, at a November investor conference, referred to a
presentation with a slide titled “Capacity management is key to
a successful retail origination business.” The  document , which
illustrated the cycles of hiring and firing in the mortgage
operation, showed the hiring of 5,900 full-time workers in nine
months of 2010. It then cut 5,000 employees over the next six
months before hiring 7,000 over the next 15 months through the
third quarter of 2012, according to the presentation.  Wells Fargo accounted for almost 1 in 3 U.S. home loans
last year, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade
publication.  #<675848.3900065.3.7.0.0.25>#
