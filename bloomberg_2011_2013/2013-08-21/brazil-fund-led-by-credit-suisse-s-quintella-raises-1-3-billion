Peninsula Investimentos SA, the
Brazilian asset-management firm that  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) 
helped create last year, raised about 3.25 billion reais ($1.3
billion) for a hedge fund that caters to high-net-worth clients.  The fund, called Peninsula Hedge Master Fundo de
Investimento Multimercado, started in December and is now closed
to new deposits, a filing with the Brazilian securities
regulator, known as CVM, showed yesterday. The fund invests only
in liquid assets such as stock, fixed-income bonds and  futures
markets , according to the filing.  This is the first fund for Peninsula, a partnership between
Credit Suisse and a group of 16 executives including Peninsula
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Quintella, who previously led
the Americas for the Zurich-based bank, and Sergio Fraiman Blatyta, ex-head of proprietary trading at Banco Santander
Brasil SA.  Credit Suisse Hedging-Griffo, the lender’s asset-management
and private-banking subsidiary in  Brazil , is among firms that
are distributing the new hedge fund to clients. The fund
returned 7.14 percent this year through yesterday, according to
the company’s website, outpacing the 4.62 percent interbank
interest rate.  Quintella, who’s also chairman of Credit Suisse Hedging-Griffo, was paid 15.6 million Swiss francs ($17 million) for
2010, making him Credit Suisse’s top-paid executive for that
year.  Peninsula Investimentos declined to comment on the fund,
according to an official who asked not to be named in keeping
with company policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
