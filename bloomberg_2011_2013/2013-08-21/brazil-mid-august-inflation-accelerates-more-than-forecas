Brazil ’s  consumer prices  rose more
than analysts forecast in the month through mid-August as
increasing education costs offset declines in housing.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15  price index  rose
0.16 percent from July 13 to August 13, the national statistics
agency said in a report published on its website today. That was
more than the median  forecast  of a 0.15 percent increase from 39
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Annual  inflation  of 6.15
percent also exceeded estimates made by analysts.  Brazil’s central bank this year has raised  interest rates 
more than any other major economy in the world in a bid to tame
inflation that has remained above the 4.5 percent midpoint of
the target range since September 2010. On Aug. 19, President
 Dilma Rousseff  said inflation was under control. The same day,
central bank President Alexandre Tombini said traders were
betting on too high an increase in borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 10.33 percent at 9:06 a.m. local time. The
real weakened 0.5 percent to 2.4059 per  U.S. dollar .  “The recent movement seen in interest rates in the market
has incorporated excessive premium,” Tombini said in the
statement published on the central bank’s website.  Tombini’s statement came a week after the central bank’s
monetary policy director, Carlos Hamilton, said Brazil’s fiscal
policy is expansionary and the real’s depreciation is fueling
inflation that will probably accelerate. The real has weakened
14.8 percent against the dollar in the past three months, the
worst performance among the 16 most-traded currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Central bank directors will hold their monetary policy
meeting on August 27 and 28. Policy makers raised the benchmark
Selic interest rate by 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point,
in each of its past two meetings, to 8.50 percent. In April,
they boosted the Selic by 25 basis points.  Economists forecast 5.74 percent inflation and 2.21 percent
economic expansion in 2013, according to the latest central bank
survey. The analysts forecast the Selic will reach 9.25 percent
at year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
