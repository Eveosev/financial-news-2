Paolo Rocca, the Argentine
billionarie, will arrive in Chubut province today to sign a 10-year extension for an oil area, the province Oil Minister said.  “Rocca is coming given the importance of the deal we are
signing today,” said Ezequiel Cufre in a telephone interview
from Comodoro Rivadavia, Chubut. “We are giving his company an
extension.”  President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government
seized a 51 percent stake in YPF from Spain’s Repsol SA in April
2012 to stem fuel imports that doubled to $9.4 billion in 2011
and cost the country $10 billion in 2012.  The agreement between Tecpetrol SA, a subsidiary of  Tenaris
SA (TEN) , and the provincial government obliges Tecpetrol to drill
conventional and shale wells in formation D-129. Tecpetrol will
also have to bring a new rig before January or show it has
acquired one to apply for a 200-day extension.  Tecpetrol owns 51 percent of the venture while Petrobras
Argentina SA owns 25 percent and YPF the remainder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
