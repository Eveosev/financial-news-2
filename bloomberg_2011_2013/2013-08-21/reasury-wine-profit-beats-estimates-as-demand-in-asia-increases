Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. (TWE) , the
world’s second-largest listed wine maker,  fell  to its lowest in
seven months in Sydney trading after forecasting full-year
earnings may be as much as 7.6 percent below analyst estimates.  The  stock  slid 2.3 percent to close at A$4.70, the lowest
since Jan. 29. The drop pared Treasury’s gains this year to 0.2
percent,  while  the S&P/ASX 200 Index has climbed 9.2 percent.  Earnings before, interest, tax, and adjustments for the
value of vineyards will range between A$230 million ($207
million) and A$250 million in the 12 months started July, the
Melbourne-based company said today. That compares with the  A$249
million average  of 10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Net income in the year ended June fell 53 percent to A$42
million, beating the A$26 million average of four analysts’
estimates.  Treasury, whose brands include Penfolds and Beringer, said
July 15 that it would write A$160 million off the value of its
U.S. unit to discount and destroy old and out-of-date bottles.
Earnings in 2014 will be up to A$30 million lower as a result of
the actions to deal with an oversupply of cheap wines in the
U.S., Treasury said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
