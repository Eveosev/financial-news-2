Following is the text of the weekly
Petroleum Status Report from the U.S. Department of Energy:  U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged over 15.8 million
barrels per day during the week ending August 16, 2013, 234
thousand barrels per day above the previous weekâ€™s average.
Refineries operated at 91.0 percent of their operable capacity
last week. Gasoline production increased last week, averaging
over 9.4 million barrels per day. Distillate fuel production
increased last week, averaging 4.9 million barrels per day.  U.S. crude oil imports averaged about 8.0 million barrels per
day last week, up by 34 thousand barrels per day from the
previous week. Over the last four weeks, crude oil imports
averaged just under 8.0 million barrels per day, 501 thousand
barrels per day below the same four-week period last year. Total
motor gasoline imports (including both finished gasoline and
gasoline blending components) last week averaged 373 thousand
barrels per day. Distillate fuel imports averaged 101 thousand
barrels per day last week.  U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the

inventories are near the upper limit of the average range for
this time of year. Total motor gasoline inventories decreased by
4.0 million barrels last week and are in the upper half of the

product supplied averaged 9.2 million barrels per day, up by 2.0
percent from the same period last year. Distillate fuel product
