Online women’s fashion retailers
 JustFab Inc.  and Shoedazzle.com Inc. announced plans to merge, a
move aimed at expanding their customer base in the U.S. and
accelerating expansion overseas.  Adam Goldenberg and Don Ressler, co-chief executive
officers of JustFab, will run the combined company, according to
a statement today. The new business will be called JustFab Inc.
while maintaining ShoeDazzle as one of four brands. Financial
terms weren’t disclosed, and both companies’ backers will be
investors in the joint entity.  Founded in 2010, JustFab has more than 15 million users in
the U.S.,  Germany ,  Canada ,  France ,  Spain  and the U.K, according
to the statement. ShoeDazzle, started the previous year, is
among a spate of e-commerce startups including BeachMint Inc.
and Gilt Groupe Inc. that have had to reorganize after the
emergence of copycats forced them to spend more on marketing,
and in some cases, to lower prices.  “Scale is very important for e-commerce companies,”
Goldenberg said in an interview. “I see us continuing to grow
and take market share from traditional retailers, specialty
retailers and other e-commerce players.”  The combined company expects to generate more than $400
million in revenue and be profitable next year, according to the
statement.  ShoeDazzle CEO Brian Lee will join JustFab’s board and co-founder MJ Eng will keep running the ShoeDazzle brand. Lee, who
founded ShoeDazzle, took over the CEO role from Bill Strauss
last year. Strauss left after ShoeDazzle, which sends purses and
shoes to subscribers for a monthly fee, eliminated fees in
months users made no purchases, deflating sales.  Women’s Shoes  Goldenberg said that he and Lee had been working on the
deal for three months. About 70 percent of JustFab’s business is
in women’s shoes, according to Goldenberg, while for ShoeDazzle
it’s 85 percent to 90 percent, Lee said.  ShoeDazzle has  raised  more than $60 million in venture
funding, including a $40 million round in 2011 led by Andreessen
Horowitz. Previous investors include Lightspeed Venture Partners
and Polaris Ventures. All of ShoeDazzle’s backers will be
investors in the joint company, Lee said.  “This will be a very large potential exit for all
investors,” Lee said.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News , is an investor
in Andreessen Horowitz.  JustFab raised $76 million last year from a group led by
Rho Ventures LLC, and said at the time it planned to use the
funds to broaden its overseas business, including through
acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
