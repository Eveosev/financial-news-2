Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , the U.K.’s
largest mortgage provider, agreed to sell its German life
insurance business, Heidelberger Lebensversicherung AG, to
Cinven Partners LLP and  Hannover Re .  Cinven and Hannover Re will pay about 300 million euros
($403 million) in cash, London-based Lloyds said in a statement
today. The bank will book a loss of about 330 million pounds
($517 million) from the sale.  Lloyds Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio is
shrinking assets and cutting costs as he prepares for the
government to start reducing its stake in the lender after it
was bailed out during the financial crisis.  “The sale is in line with the group’s strategy of
rationalizing its international presence and ensuring value for
shareholders,” Lloyds said in the statement.  Heidelberger Leben has 600,000 policies and 5.2 billion
euros of assets at Dec. 31 and is based in Heidelberg,  Germany ,
Cinven said in a separate statement today.  Separately, Lloyds said it agreed to sell a portfolio of
leveraged loans to a unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for 254
million pounds.  -- Editors: Edward Evans, Dylan Griffiths  To contact the reporter on this story:
