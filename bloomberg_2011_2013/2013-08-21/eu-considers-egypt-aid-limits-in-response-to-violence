European Union foreign ministers
weighed how to restrict  Egypt ’s access to arms and military aid
in response to escalating violence in the nation.  The U.K. and  Germany  said they had suspended their arms
exports and urged other countries to review their own military
cooperation with Egypt, as ministers from the 28 EU states
gathered in Brussels to discuss the situation in the Arab
nation. At the same time, ministers said they wanted to support
the Egyptian people and avoid taking sides in the country’s
internal struggles.  “Business as usual is not possible,” German Foreign
Minister  Guido Westerwelle  told reporters in Brussels today as
he arrived for the meeting. “We will consider, observe, and
then we will draw our consequences on Egypt.”  The Egyptian government’s crackdown on Islamic protests has
led to a spasm of violence that has left more than 900 civilians
dead in the span of a week. The unrest prompted the EU to summon
foreign ministers to an emergency meeting to consider the
consequences of recent events.  As the meeting began, ministers stopped short of calling
for full-fledged economic sanctions on Egypt, instead urging
limits on weapon sales along with renewed efforts to find a
political solution. The EU in November announced 5 billion euros
($6.7 billion) in aid and loans available to Egypt, including
about 1 billion euros in direct EU assistance that has mostly
been on hold because Egypt hasn’t met payment conditions.  Public Protests  Egypt’s military leaders toppled the Muslim Brotherhood-allied government of President Mohamed Mursi, the nation’s first
freely elected leader, on July 3 after growing public protests
against his actions. Egyptian authorities are pressing ahead
with a crackdown on the Brotherhood that has battered the 85-year-old Islamist organization’s leadership.  “We want to see an inclusive political process in Egypt
and it means we condemn disproportionate acts of the security
forces in Egypt,” U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said,
also condemning recent attacks on churches and hospitals. “Such
actions do not win support for the  Muslim Brotherhood  or anybody
working with them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
