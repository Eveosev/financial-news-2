Motiva Enterprises LLC’s  refinery  in
Convent,  Louisiana , was forced to shut a crude unit after an
Aug. 19 fire, a person familiar with operations said.  The unit has been out of operation since the fire, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  The 255,000-barrel-a-day Convent plant is 50 miles (80
kilometers) west of  New Orleans . Motiva is a refining and
marketing joint venture of Saudi Refining Inc., a subsidiary of
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., and Shell Oil, a unit of  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc. (RDSA)   Destin Singleton, a spokeswoman for Shell in Houston, said
on Aug. 19 that the fire broke out in the pump of a process unit
at 2:25 p.m. local time and declined to name the equipment. She
said in an e-mail today that she has no update on its status.  To contact the reporter on this story:
