U.K. stocks  fell to the lowest level
in more than six weeks amid speculation minutes from last
month’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting will signal when
the U.S. central bank could start tapering stimulus measures.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company, and
 Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , a producer of gold and silver, slid more than 1.5
percent as metal prices dropped.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  led a decline
in U.K. banks. Aberdeen Asset Management Plc fell 5.9 percent,
following European financial-services companies lower.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  slipped 62.62 points, or 1 percent, to
6,390.84 at the close in London, its lowest level since July 5.
The gauge  has fallen  6.6 percent from a high on May 22 after Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may reduce its
monthly bond purchases if the economy strengthens in line with
forecasts. The broader FTSE All-Share Index retreated 0.8
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index advanced 0.2 percent.  “We’re seeing a selloff in markets because there is still
nervousness that Fed tapering may start next month,” said
Jacques Porta, who helps oversee about $780 million as a  fund
manager  at Ofi Gestion Privee in Paris. “Investors are waiting
to see what officials said at the last FOMC meeting. It’s
possible we will have more information this week about the
timing of the exit. If not, markets are going to stay nervous.”  HSBC,  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  and six other companies
traded without the right to their latest dividends today,
shaving off 10.6 points from the FTSE 100. The volume of shares
changing hands in companies listed on the equity benchmark was
12 percent lower than the 30-day average, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  FOMC Minutes  The Fed will publish minutes from the FOMC’s July 30-31
meeting at 2 p.m. in Washington today. Investors will scrutinize
policy makers’ deliberations for evidence of when the Fed will
start paring its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases. The FOMC
holds its next meeting on Sept. 17-18.  The U.S. central bank will start to scale back bond buying
next month, according to 65 percent of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. The median estimate called for
purchases to drop to $75 billion a month.  Central bankers and policy makers will meet in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming on Aug. 22-24 to discuss the global economy and
monetary policy. Speakers include International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  and Bank of Japan Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda. Bernanke, who has given the keynote speech at
the annual symposium every year since becoming Fed chairman in
2006, does not plan to attend the conference.  Miners Fall  A  gauge  of mining companies in the FTSE 350 Index declined
for a third day as copper and gold prices fell. BHP lost 2.6
percent to 1,873 pence and Fresnillo dropped 1.7 percent to
1,164 pence. Rio Tinto Group, the second-biggest commodity
producer, retreated 2.1 percent to 2,987 pence.  HSBC, Europe’s largest lender, slid 2.3 percent to 682
pence.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  lost 1.3 percent to 283 pence and  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  dropped 1.3 percent to 334.1 pence.  Aberdeen slipped 5.9 percent to 356.3 pence and Schroders
Plc declined 2 percent to 2,334 pence. Banks and financial-services firms were the  worst performers  of the 19 industry
groups on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  BP Plc (BP/) , Europe’s second-largest oil company, retreated 1.1
percent to 432.55 pence as crude declined to a one-week low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
