Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired Mauro Roca from Deutsche Bank AG as an economist for Latin America,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Roca had worked as a local markets strategist and senior
economist in Deutsche Bank’s Latin America group since 2010 and
previously held jobs at the  International Monetary Fund ,
Barclays Plc and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs, and Roca
declined to comment on his employment at the firm. The company’s
Latin America economics team is led by managing director  Alberto Ramos .  Roca’s departure from Deutsche Bank’s Latin America group
follows those of corporate credit analyst Natalia Corfield and
economist Fernando Losada.  Amanda Williams , a spokeswoman for
Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the departures.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. hired Corfield to join its emerging-market corporate credit research group, two people with direct
knowledge of the matter said Aug. 12. Losada joined
AllianceBernstein LP as senior economist for Latin America in
May, according to Jonathan Freedman, a spokesman for the New
York-based firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
