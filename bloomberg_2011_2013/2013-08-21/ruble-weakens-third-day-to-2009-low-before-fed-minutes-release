The ruble weakened to the lowest
level in four years and  Russia ’s government bonds fell as oil
and emerging-market currencies sank ahead of the publication of
minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.  The ruble depreciated 0.1 percent to 38.0594 against the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket, the weakest since August 2009
on a closing basis, by 1:01 p.m. in Moscow. The yield on the
government’s ruble bond due February 2027 rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.93 percent, the highest
since July 5.  Currencies from  Indonesia  to  South Africa  weakened amid
prospects the U.S. Federal Reserve will pare stimulus. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  publishes minutes today of its
July meeting, with 65 percent of economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  predicting the Fed will taper bond purchases in
September. Brent oil declined by 0.8 percent to $109.31 per
barrel. The oil and natural gas industries generate about 50
percent of Russia’s government revenue.  “The ruble’s getting sold along with other emerging-market
currencies as global investors lose appetite,” Anton Zakharov,
 money manager  at OAO Promsvyazbank in Moscow, said by e-mail.  The ruble is the 12th best performer against the dollar
among 24 emerging market currencies in the last three months
with a 5.5 percent decline. India’s rupee has lost 14 percent in
the same period, and the Indonesian rupiah has weakened by 9
percent.  Bank Rossii has spent 369 billion rubles ($11 billion) on
market interventions since 29 to prevent excess volatility in
the currency. The regulator has also raised its managed floating
band for the ruble to 32.00-39.00 rubles versus the basket from
31.65-38.65 in the past two months.  The Russian currency slid 0.2 percent against the dollar to
3.0220 today and traded little changed against the euro at
44.2230.  “If not for the central bank interventions, it’d be lower
against both the dollar and the euro,” Zakharov added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
