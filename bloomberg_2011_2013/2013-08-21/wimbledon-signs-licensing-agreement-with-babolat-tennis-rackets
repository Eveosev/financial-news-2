Wimbledon reached an agreement with
Babolat to have the French company become the official supplier
of tennis rackets, bags and accessories for the grasscourt Grand
Slam championship.  The agreement will begin Jan. 1, the two parties said in a
joint statement without disclosing terms. Babolat is currently
the official shoe supplier for Wimbledon.  “We are delighted to be extending our relationship with
Babolat from shoes to rackets and bags,” Mick Desmond,
commercial director of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, said in
a statement. “We have been impressed by the care and attention
that Babolat has paid to all aspects of product development and
design and we look forward to working with the team from Babolat
well into the future.”  Babolat, a family-owned company that began in 1875, is also
the official supplier of rackets, balls and accessories to the
 French Open .  Rafael Nadal , a 12-time Grand Slam winner from
Spain, and former major champions  Li Na  of China and Sam Stosur
of Australia use the company’s rackets and strings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
