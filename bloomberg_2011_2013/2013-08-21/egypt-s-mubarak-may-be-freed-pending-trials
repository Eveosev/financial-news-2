A Cairo court ordered  Hosni Mubarak 
released over accusations that he accepted gifts from a state-run organization, raising the possibility the former president
may soon be freed pending trials for a series of charges against
him.  The court said Mubarak should be freed if he’s not being
held in relation to any other cases. The decision means Mubarak
will be released as he’s already been ordered free pending the
other probes and cases, the state-run Middle East  News Agency 
said. State television said prosecutors were considering whether
to appeal the order though MENA, citing an unidentified judicial
official, said the ruling was “final.”  His release would inject new tension in the standoff
between the Muslim Brotherhood and the military-backed
government and provide ammunition to those who accuse the new
leadership of restoring the kind of police state that Mubarak
led for three decades. Secular and Islamist activists alike have
demanded he be held accountable for the deaths of protesters
during the 2011 rallies that swept him from power.  State-run Nile News said Mubarak could be freed tomorrow,
citing his lawyer. Farid ElDib, his lawyer, couldn’t be reached
when called on his mobile phone. On Aug. 19, ElDib said in an
interview that Mubarak could go home “in two to three days.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
