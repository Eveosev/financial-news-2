Ibovespa  futures  fluctuated between
gains and losses as a weaker real boosted the outlook for
Brazilian exporters, offsetting concern that the U.S. will start
cutting back stimulus as soon as next month.  Oil company  QGEP Participacoes SA (QGEP3)  may move after saying it
found crude and gas in one of its blocks in Brazil’s
Jequitinhonha basin.  Cia. de Gas de Sao Paulo  may be active
after saying it plans to sell 400 million reais of bonds.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in October fell 0.2
percent to 49,965 at 9:23 a.m. in Sao Paulo after earlier rising
as much as 0.4 percent. The real weakened 0.6 percent to 2.4076
per dollar. U.S. stock-index futures fell before the Fed’s
publication of minutes of last month’s policy meeting.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will probably decide to
reduce its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases at its Sept.
17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  from Aug. 9 to Aug. 13.  In Brazil, consumer prices, as measured by the IPCA-15
 price index , rose 0.16 percent in the month through mid-August,
the national statistics agency said today. The median  forecast 
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase of 0.15
percent.  The Ibovespa has gained 12 percent from this year’s low on
July 3 as higher commodities prices and a weaker real boosted
raw-material exporters. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21
developing nations’ equities advanced 1.6 percent during the
same period.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo yesterday was 7.02
billion reais, compared with a daily average of 7.77 billion
reais this year through Aug. 19, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
