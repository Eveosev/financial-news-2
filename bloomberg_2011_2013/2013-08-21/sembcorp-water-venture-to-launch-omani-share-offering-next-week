An initial public offering by the
water and power joint venture of  Sembcorp Industries Ltd. (SCI) , the
largest utility in  Southeast Asia , will begin next week in Oman
on the  Muscat Securities Market .  The IPO by Sembcorp Salalah Power & Water Co. that’s due to
run from Aug. 28 to Sept. 26 is expected to raise 53 million
rials ($138 million) and result in a market value of 152 million
rials when trading first begins around Oct. 10, Singapore-based
Sembcorp said today in a statement.  Sembcorp Salalah is 60 percent owned by Sembcorp, 35
percent by Oman Investment Corp. and the rest by Bahrain-based
BDCC Investment Co. Sembcorp’s $1 billion Salalah water and
power facility that features a reverse-osmosis desalination
plant with 69,000 cubic meters a day of capacity formally opened
in May.  Post-listing, Sembcorp will hold a 40 percent stake in
Sembcorp Salalah, it said. Under Oman’s terms, existing
shareholders were required to conduct an IPO and make 35 percent
of the shares available to the public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
