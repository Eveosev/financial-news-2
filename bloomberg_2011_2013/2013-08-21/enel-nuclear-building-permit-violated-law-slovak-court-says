Slovakia’s nuclear watchdog violated
the law when it issued a building permit for  Enel SpA (ENEL) ’s 3.7
billion-euro ($5 billion) nuclear project because Greenpeace
wasn’t allowed to comment, the Supreme Court ruled.  The Italian utility’s local unit, Slovenske Elektrarne AS,
in 2009 began building two new reactors at the Mochovce nuclear
power plant after receiving a permit by the Office for Nuclear
Supervision. The high court asked the regulator to repeat the
proceeding and include Greenpeace, according to the June 27
 ruling  posted on the office’s website today.  “We wanted to know more about the project, but we were not
allowed,” Juraj Rizman, the head of Greenpeace Slovak office,
said by phone from the capital Bratislava. “This isn’t a
dispute about nuclear energy as such, it’s a dispute about
respecting the law and citizens’ right to have a say.”  The construction is already facing delays and cost
overruns, which Slovenske has attributed to tougher safety
standards after the Fukushima nuclear accident. Enel plans to
boost generation capacity in the country, which is seeking to
regain self-sufficiency in power production following the
shutdown of Soviet-era reactors.  The office will restart the proceeding and allow Greenpeace
to inspect all documents, Dagmar Zemanova, the spokesman for the
regulator, said. The ruling, which can’t be appealed, doesn’t
imply work on the project must be halted immediately, she said.  The ruling doesn’t revoke the permit and works on the site
can continue, an Enel company spokesperson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
