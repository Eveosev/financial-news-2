U.K. prosecutors are working with
U.S. authorities and British financial regulators as part of an
investigation into a $6.2 billion loss on derivatives at
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The  Serious Fraud Office , which is in charge of most U.K.
white-collar crime enforcement, is “liaising with our U.S.
counterparts” and the Financial Conduct Authority, spokeswoman
Jina Roe said in an e-mail today.  U.S. prosecutors unsealed charges against London-based
JPMorgan traders Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout last week
for allegedly attempting to hide trading losses caused by Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman known as the “London Whale” because his
portfolio was so large.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Aug. 14 that he
was “hopeful” the men, neither of whom are in the U.S., would
return to face the charges. Grout’s lawyers have said he’s in
 France , and Martin-Artajo’s have said he is away from his home
in the U.K. on vacation.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, and the U.K. FCA are also probing
the losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
