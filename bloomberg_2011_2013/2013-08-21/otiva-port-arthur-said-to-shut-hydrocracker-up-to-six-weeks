Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Port
Arthur,  Texas ,  refinery  will take two to six weeks to repair a
hydrocracker damaged in an Aug. 17 fire, a person familiar with
plant operations said today.  The refinery is operating at less than half its 600,000-barrel-a-day capacity because the largest crude unit has been
idling since the fire, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  The 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit will be out of
production until the refinery finds a source to purchase its
output of vacuum gasoil that would normally be fed to the
hydrocracker to make motor fuel, the person said. Repairs to the
hydrocracker will include the unit’s wiring and instrumentation,
the person said.  Even before the hydrocracker fire, production was reduced
after an Aug. 12 fire in a sulfur recovery unit’s reactor. The
refinery is forced to operate four nearby hydrotreaters and
three lube units at lower rates while the unit is shut for
repairs estimated to take up to two weeks, the person said.  Destin Singleton, a Houston-based spokeswoman for Motiva,
said yesterday that Motiva shut down a unit on Aug. 17 after an
“operational issue.” She said that while repairs are being
made, several integrated units will run at reduced rates and
others are being shut down. She said today that she has no
updates on Port Arthur operations.  Motiva’s Port Arthur plant is the largest U.S. refinery.
Motiva is a joint venture between refining units of  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  and the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
