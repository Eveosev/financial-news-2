Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)  won a court
ruling that puts on hold claims accusing the company of
profiting from using likenesses of college athletes in its video
games.  The ruling by a federal appeals court in San Francisco will
delay the four-year-old lawsuit, which is still in the
preliminary stages, from proceeding until after the U.S. Supreme
Court considers the case.  The appeals court on July 31 ruled that Electronic Arts,
the second-largest U.S. videogame maker, wasn’t protected by the
First Amendment from former college athletes’ claims that the
company violated their rights by using their images in its
“NCAA Football” games without paying them or getting their
permission. EA said it will seek review of that ruling by the
U.S. Supreme Court.  If the court accepts the case, it might be months before it
issues a final ruling. The ex-players are seeking compensation
for use of their likenesses and might demand $100 million in
damages, EA said in a Aug. 19 filing.  The lawsuit was filed in 2009 by former  Arizona  State
University quarterback Sam Keller on behalf of other athletes
whose images are used in the video games.  Rob Carey , an attorney
for Keller, declined to comment on the ruling.  The case is Keller v. Electronic Arts, 10-15387,  U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
