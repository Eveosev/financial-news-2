Russian stocks sank for a second day
as a drop in the price of oil offset gains by the country’s
largest wireless carrier.  The 50-stock Micex Index lost 0.4 percent to 1,371.98
rubles by 12:45 a.m. in Moscow, erasing an earlier gain of 0.9
percent. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil producer, fell 0.6
percent to 226.1 rubles, while OAO Mobile TeleSystems added 1.3
percent to 298.98 rubles, its third day of gains.  Brent crude  fell 0.5 percent to $109.62 a barrel in London.
Russia receives half of its budget revenue from the oil and
natural gas industries. The  Federal Open Market Committee 
publishes minutes today of its July meeting, with 65 percent of
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  predicting the Fed will
taper bond purchases in September.  Trading will be “choppy,” BCS Financial Group said in a
note to investors today. “Markets are seeking clarity to the
timing and magnitude of any tapering.”  The Micex trades at 5.2 times its 12-month estimated
earnings, compared with a multiple of 10.5 for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index. The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 19
percent above the 30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  MTS’s American depositary receipts climbed 4.5 percent
yesterday, the most since Nov. 29, rebounding from the cheapest
level in a month relative to OAO MegaFon, the nation’s second-largest wireless carrier. MegaFon’s Moscow-traded shares added 1
percent to 1,102.50 rubles today.  Data Spending  MTS, controlled by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov,
boosted its profitability forecast yesterday as subscribers
spent more on data. The company is pushing tariff plans with
unlimited voice and selling cheaper smartphones to get more
users to surf the Web and watch video on their handsets.
Yesterday’s rally drove the ADRs to the highest valuation in
almost four months, narrowing its discount to MegaFon, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity gauge rose 0.6 percent to
91.43 yesterday. The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the largest
exchange-traded fund dedicated to Russian equities, added 0.7
percent to $26.37. The RTS volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in the stock futures, climbed 1.5 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
