Telekomunikacja Polska SA, Poland’s
largest phone company, headed for the biggest gain in three
months after UniCredit SpA recommended buying its shares, saying
a recent selloff was overdone.  The  stock  rose as much as 3.9 percent and traded 3.2
percent higher at 7.38 zloty as of 1:12 p.m. in Warsaw, heading
for the biggest advance since May 14. UniCredit upgraded the
Polish unit of  Orange SA (ORA)  to buy from hold and increased its
price estimate 11 percent to 8.13 zloty.  TPSA shares have plunged 40 percent this year, making it
the  worst-performing  stock in Warsaw’s benchmark WIG20 Index, as
falling mobile phone rates, rising competition and economic
slowdown hurt earnings and prompted its management to reduce a
dividend 67 percent to 0.5 zloty a share. Second-quarter profit
declined 70 percent to 76 million zloty ($24 million) while
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
fell 23 percent to 1 billion zloty, the company said last month.  “The recent shares sell-off has come just as TPSA has
regained its capex flexibility, supporting dividends at a
minimum current level of 0.5 zloty per share,” Przemyslaw Sawala-Uryasz, an analyst at UniCredit in Warsaw, said in a note
today. “Organic free cash flows support dividend upside to at
least 0.6 zloty per share, with a safety buffer sufficient for
an upgrade over the next two years.”  Standard & Poor’s this month cut TPSA rating by one level
to BBB, the second-lowest investment grade, citing shrinking
profit and a “meaningful” drop in free cash flows this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
