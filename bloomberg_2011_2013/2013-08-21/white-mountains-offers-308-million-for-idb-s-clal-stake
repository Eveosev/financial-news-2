White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd. (WTM) 
offered to pay 1.1 billion shekels ($308 million) for IDB
Development Corp.’s 55 percent interest in  Clal Insurance
Enterprises Holdings Ltd. (CLIS)   The offer will expire unless accepted by 5 p.m. today in
 Tel Aviv ,  White Mountains (WMT)  said in a letter included in a
regulatory filing yesterday. The transaction would have to be
completed by May 31.  IDB Development Chairman Nochi Dankner is seeking to sell
assets as the company struggles to pay creditors. White
Mountains Chief Executive Officer Ray Barrette highlighted his
ability to complete a transaction quickly. The company already
has holdings including Sirius International Insurance Group and
a majority stake in One Beacon Insurance Group.  “Our extensive experience in the insurance business and
good relations with insurance regulators around the world make
us a reliable party to close this transaction,” Barrette wrote.  White Mountains has $5 billion in capital, about $1 billion
of which is immediately available for new investments, he wrote.
The Hanover, New Hampshire-based company’s shares have advanced
8.7 percent this year.  IDB said yesterday that it had agreed to sell 32 percent of
Clal to Hong Kong-based JT Capital Management Ltd. for about for
1.47 billion shekels. Dankner’s company faces a court deadline
in Tel Aviv to sell a stake in Clal by today. An unidentified
Thai investor withdrew an offer for the insurer last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
