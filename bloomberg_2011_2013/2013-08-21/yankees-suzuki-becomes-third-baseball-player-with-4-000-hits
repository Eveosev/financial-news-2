Ichiro Suzuki  bowed as his  New York 
Yankees teammates crowded first base to celebrate his 4,000th
career hit that put him in the company of  Pete Rose  and Ty Cobb.  Suzuki lined a 1-1 pitch off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher R.A. Dickey past third baseman Brett Lawrie in the first inning last 
night at Yankee Stadium. New York won the game 4-2.  “It’s supposed to be a number that was just special to me,
but what happened tonight I wasn’t expecting,” Suzuki said
after his teammates interrupted the game to join him at first
base. “I wasn’t expecting so much joy and happiness from
them.”  The 39-year-old Suzuki tipped his cap to the crowd as he
took his defensive position in right field in the second inning.  Suzuki has 2,722 hits in  Major League Baseball  and 1,278 in
 Japan ’s Pacific League. Rose had 4,256 hits and Cobb tallied
4,191 hits.  “[Mine] is a record that is from two leagues,” Suzuki told
reporters before last night’s game. “Those guys did it in one 
league. I don’t think you have to put me in that same category 
as them.”  Before beginning his major league career with the  Seattle
Mariners  in 2001, Suzuki played seven seasons for the Orix Blue
Wave in Japan’s Pacific League, where he collected 1,278 hits.
Among major league players, Suzuki now ranks 59th with  2,722
hits , one more than Yankees Hall of Famer  Lou Gehrig .  Hit After Hit  “After I got my first hit, if at that point I said to you
guys, ‘My goal is to have 4,000 hits,’ I think everybody would
have called me an idiot,” Suzuki said. “Now, after years and
years of just getting hits every day, I’ve come to this point.
What is important is just going out there and doing what you can
do every single day.”  Suzuki had at least 200 hits in 10 straight seasons after
coming to the Mariners, joining Rose as the only players to
reach the milestone in 10 seasons. Rose’s longest run of
consecutive 200-hit seasons was three.  “From Japan to the Mariners and continuing with the  New
York Yankees , Ichiro’s historic milestone is testament to his
position as one of the greatest hitters in the game of
baseball,” the Mariners said in a statement.  Suzuki was the first Japanese position player to be signed
by a major league team and holds records including the single-season mark for hits with 262 in 2004. In his first season with
the Mariners, who paid $13 million for the right to negotiate a
contract with him, he led the  American League  with a .350 
batting average and 56 stolen bases and was selected the 
league’s Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player.  A 10-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove winner
for his defensive prowess in the outfield, Suzuki joined the 
Yankees in a trade with the Mariners on July 23, 2012, and 
signed a two-year contract with New York in December.  “I didn’t have 4,000 hits in my whole career, and you can
go back to tee ball,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said. “To me,
it’s an unbelievable feat, and he’s some kind of hitter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
