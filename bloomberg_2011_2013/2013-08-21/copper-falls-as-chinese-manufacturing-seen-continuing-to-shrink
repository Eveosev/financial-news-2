Copper futures fell for the second
time in three days on mounting concern that the Federal Reserve
will signal plans to scale back stimulus just as demand from
Chinese manufacturing contracts.  The Fed will release minutes today of its July meeting,
which may indicate when officials plan to taper monthly bond
purchases aimed at stoking economic growth. The Bloomberg U.S.
Dollar Index rose the most in a week. A Chinese factory gauge
due tomorrow from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics will
show a preliminary reading for August of 48.2, economists
surveyed by Bloomberg said. Levels below 50 signal shrinkage.  “The Fed minutes add an extra level of risk that people
don’t want to front-run,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market
strategist at Archer Financial Inc. in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “There are also some jitters over  emerging
markets , and strength in the dollar isn’t supportive for
copper.”  Copper futures for delivery in December declined 0.9
percent to settle at $3.3125 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. Prices are down 1.6 percent this week, on course to
retreat the most since June after three straight gains.  The U.S. central bank will start to slow its $85 billion-a-month deb -buying in September, according to a Bloomberg survey.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months lost 1.1 percent to $7,240 a metric ton ($3.28 a pound)  Tin for delivery in three months on the LME dropped 1.1
percent to $21,750 a ton.  Aluminum, nickel, lead and zinc fell in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
