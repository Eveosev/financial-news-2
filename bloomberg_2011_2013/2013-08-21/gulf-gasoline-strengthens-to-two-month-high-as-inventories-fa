U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline
strengthened versus futures after regional supplies fell and
refineries in Louisiana and Texas kept units shut after fires.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast gained 1.62 cents to a discount of 15.13 cents a gallon
below  New York  Mercantile Exchange futures at 2:24 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the smallest
discount since June 14.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  strengthened by 1.25 cents
to 5 cents a gallon less than futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel 
was unchanged at 2.13 cents below futures on the Nymex.  Gasoline inventories in PADD 3 fell by 1.03 million barrels
to 75.6 million in the week ended Aug. 16, the lowest level
since June 14.  Distillate inventories  in the region grew by
165,000 to 41.8 million barrels.  Motiva Enterprises LLC will take two to six weeks to repair
a hydrocracker damaged in an Aug. 17 fire at its Port Arthur,
Texas, refinery, a person familiar with plant operations said
today.  The refinery is operating at less than half its 600,000-barrel-a-day capacity because the largest crude unit has been
idling since the fire, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  Motiva’s Convent refinery in Louisiana shut a unit on Aug.
19 after a fire broke out on a pump in one of the process units,
Destin Singleton, a Houston-based company spokeswoman, said by
e-mail.  The shutdowns may tighten supplies of gasoline and diesel
along the Gulf, the center for U.S. exports, and contribute to
the strengthening of prices as refiners may need to purchase
fuel to meet commitments.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
 Texas  Intermediate crude in Cushing,  Oklahoma , strengthened by
$1.55 to $16.66 a barrel. The  same spread based  on Light
Louisiana Sweet oil gained $1.45 to $13.26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
