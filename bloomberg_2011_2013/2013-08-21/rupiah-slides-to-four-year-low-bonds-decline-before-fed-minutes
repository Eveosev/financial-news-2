Indonesia ’s rupiah fell to a four-year low and government bonds declined on concern the U.S. is
preparing to scale back policies that helped boost demand for
emerging-market assets.  The yield on 10-year debt rose to the highest level since
March 2011 before the  Federal Reserve  publishes today minutes of
its July meeting that may show whether it plans to reduce its
asset purchases as early as next month.  Bank Indonesia  will
remain in the currency and bond markets to stabilize the rupiah,
which is under pressure due to the Asian nation’s current-account deficit and the prospect of Fed stimulus reduction,
Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo said late yesterday.  “Most of the domestic negative stories have been priced
in, but the impact of FOMC minutes is still a concern,” said
Handy Yunianto, head of fixed-income research at PT Mandiri
Sekuritas, unit of nation’s largest bank. “The central bank is
allowing rupiah weakness to reduce imports and improve the
current account.”  The rupiah declined 0.7 percent to 10,755 per dollar as of
10:38 a.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level since April 2009, prices
from local banks show. The currency touched 10,758 earlier, the
weakest level since April 30. It traded at a 5.4 percent premium
to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which fell 2.4
percent to 11,335 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The contracts reached a four-year low of 11,355 earlier.  Rising Volatility  A  fixing  by the Association of Banks in  Singapore  used to
settle the derivative contracts was set at 10,902 today, the
lowest since April 2009. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
rose 78 basis points, or 0.78 percentage point, to 15.86
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Indonesia hired Citigroup Inc., Standard Chartered Plc and
Deutsche Bank AG to hold bond investor meetings in  Europe  and
the  Middle East  for its planned dollar sukuk starting Aug. 23,
according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to
be identified as the details are private.  The yield on the nation’s bonds due May 2023 climbed two
basis points to 8.51 percent, the highest level since March
2011, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
