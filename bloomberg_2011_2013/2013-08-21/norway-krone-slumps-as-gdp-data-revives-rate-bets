Norway ’s krone slumped for an eighth
consecutive day amid signals growth is slowing in western
Europe’s largest oil exporter.  The currency dropped as much as 1.2 percent to 6.023 per
dollar. It fell as much as 1 percent to 8.068 per euro, making
it the day’s biggest loser among major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. It slid to 1.082 per Swedish krona, the lowest since
October 2008.  DNB ASA, Norway’s largest bank, said today the central bank
will need to keep rates unchanged until the first quarter of
2015 as an expansion slows. A report this week showed mainland
gross domestic product, excluding oil, gas and shipping, rose
0.2 percent, less than a third the 0.7 percent estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  “On the whole we expect to see limited interested in the
krone going forward,” said Camilla Viland, an analyst at DNB,
in a report. She sees a stable to “somewhat” stronger krone
versus the euro. “Economic developments will disappoint,
unemployment will rise and the central bank will keep rates at
today’s levels until the spring of 2015.”  DNB predicted a krone rate of about 7.9 per euro in one
year. The bank said the mainland expansion will be 2 percent
this year and next, slowing from 3.4 percent in 2012.  The RSI on the euro-krone exchange rate traded above 70
today, the level that may signal reversal.  Norway’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate at
1.5 percent in June and signaled an increased chance for a rate
cut next month to support growth and prevent inflation from
slowing further.  Policy makers have kept borrowing costs unchanged since
March 2011 to limit gains in the krone, which emerged as a haven
from the euro crisis. A report last week showed the euro area
surfaced from its record-long recession, as Norway’s economy
slows.  Norges Bank predicts Norway’s mainland economic will grow
2.5 percent this year and 2.75 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
