Gold futures in New York headed for
their biggest drop in a week before the  Federal Reserve  releases
minutes from its previous meeting that may signal when U.S.
policy makers plan to slow stimulus.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, rose the most in a week, reducing
the appeal of bullion as an alternative asset. The  Federal Open
Market Committee  will release the minutes of its July meeting
today, reducing the appeal of bullion as an alternative asset.
The FOMC will start to taper its bond buying at its September
meeting, according to 65 percent of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13.  Gold tumbled 18 percent this year through yesterday as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value and on
speculation that the Fed may cut the $85 billion in monthly
asset purchases that helped send bullion on a 12-year bull run
through 2012. Gold advanced 16 percent since reaching a 34-month
low in June as lower prices boosted demand for jewelry, coins
and bars.  “There’s some hesitation in the market ahead of the Fed
minutes,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision
Financial Markets in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“The Fed is teetering on the fence between wanting to do some
type of tapering and not wanting to upset the apple cart, so
it’s not surprising to see consolidation ahead of the news.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$1,362.20 an ounce at 9:38 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Trading was 37 percent below the average for the past 100 days
for this time of day, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Gold jumped 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the central bank bought more than $2 trillion in
bonds to bolster the economy.  Exchange-traded product  holdings backed by the metal rose
1.5 metric tons to 1,949.2 tons yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Assets are down 26 percent this year.  Silver futures for December delivery slipped 0.6 percent to
$22.99 an ounce in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
