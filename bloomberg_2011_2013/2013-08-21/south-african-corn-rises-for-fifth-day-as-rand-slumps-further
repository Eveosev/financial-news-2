Corn futures traded in  South Africa ,
the continent’s largest grower of the grain, rose for a fifth
day as the rand slid further, increasing the cost for imports of
the grain.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, added 0.2 percent to 2,349 rand ($230) a metric ton by
the close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg.
The streak of gains is the contract’s longest since May 31.
Yellow corn for the same delivery month climbed 20 cents to
2,199.20 rand a ton.  The rand reached a six-week low against the dollar before
the release of minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s July policy
meeting. They may give indications of when the central bank will
begin slowing monthly bond purchases aimed at fueling economic
growth in the U.S.  “The rand’s weakness made prices high,” Lindy van Blommestein, a trader at Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd., said by
phone in Johannesburg.  A meal made from white corn is one of South Africa’s staple
foods and yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.2 percent to 3,355
rand a ton, advancing for a fourth session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
