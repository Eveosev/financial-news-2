India’s government bonds rallied,
pushing the 10-year yield down by the most since 2009, after the
central bank said it would buy long-dated sovereign notes in a
move that eases curbs on the supply of cash.  The Reserve Bank of India will conduct open-market debt
purchases of 80 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) on Aug. 23 and
“thereafter calibrate them both in terms of quantum and
frequency” based on market conditions, it said  yesterday . The
liquidity-tightening steps mustn’t “harden longer-term yields
sharply” and hurt lending, the RBI said after the rupee fell
beyond 64 per dollar for the first time.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government bonds due May 2023
slid 61 basis points, or 0.61 percentage point, to 8.31 percent
as of 10:04 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from the central
bank’s trading system. That’s the biggest one-day decline for a
benchmark 10-year note since March 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The rate touched 9.48 percent yesterday, the
highest since 2001.  “The move marks the start of a gradual reversal of the
liquidity tightening since mid-July,” Barclays Plc analysts led
by Siddhartha Sanyal in Mumbai wrote in a report. “We think the
tightening measures triggered in multiple stages since July 15
were unduly harsh on market liquidity and the interest rate
spectrum, without generating any commensurate support for the
rupee.”  The currency tumbled to a record 64.12 per dollar yesterday
on concern foreign outflows will accelerate as the Federal
Reserve prepares to trim its monetary stimulus that has boosted
demand for emerging-market assets. Foreign funds have pulled
about $12 billion from Indian debt and equities since May 22
when Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first signaled the central
bank may pare its $85 billion monthly bond purchases.  July Surge  The yield on bonds maturing in May 2023 jumped 75 basis
points in July, the biggest monthly surge for benchmark 10-year
rates since March 2009, as the RBI raised two interest rates and
drained liquidity from the banking system in an effort to stem
the currency’s depreciation.  A review of the measures taken since mid-July suggests the
“immediate objective of raising the short-term interest rates
has substantially been achieved,” the RBI said. The issue of
cash-management bills will be calibrated going forward,
“including scaling it down as may be necessary,” it added.  India  will seek to boost inflows through steps including
allowing state-owned financial companies to issue “quasi-sovereign” bonds to fund long-term infrastructure investment,
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said Aug. 12.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, dropped 48 basis
points to 9.46 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
