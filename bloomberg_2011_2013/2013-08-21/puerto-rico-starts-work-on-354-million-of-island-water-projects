Puerto Rico  has started work on a
water-treatment plant to provide 22,000 island families with
potable supplies and plans to begin construction next year on a
reservoir capable of storing 3 billion gallons (11 billion
liters) of water.  The $354 million of water projects that include expanding a
filtration plant and building the Valencia reservoir were
announced yesterday by Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who
said 3,100 jobs will be created to boost reliable supplies in
the U.S. commonwealth. Federal and local funding will pay for
the works.  To contact the reporter on this story:
