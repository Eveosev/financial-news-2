Trading on  California  carbon
allowances that companies can use beginning in 2016 surged after
the state sold out of the permits for the first time.  Futures contracts for a record 1.83 million 2016 allowances
for December 2015 delivery cleared today on the
 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) , settling at $12.50 each, Brookly McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the exchange in Atlanta, said by
e-mail. The previous high was 960,000 allowances on May 21.  “There is now conviction that this program will be here
for a while,” Lenny Hochschild, managing director at the  White
Plains , New York-based environmental broker Evolution Markets,
said by telephone.  California’s Air Resources Board sold all 9.56 million
permits for 2016 at $11.10 each during an Aug. 16 auction, 39
cents above the clearing price of all previous sales, the agency
said in a  report  on its website today. Each credit allows the
release of a metric ton of carbon.  The board received 1.69 bids for every allowance offered,
marking the first time that demand for advance permits exceeded
supply since the state began capping emissions last year,
creating the world’s second-largest carbon market.  California established a cap-and-trade program in an effort
to cut greenhouse-gas emissions about 15 percent by 2020. The
air board indicated in meetings this summer that it plans to
extend the program beyond 2020.  Program Requirements  Under the system, the board issues a capped number of
allowances through a combination of free allocations and
quarterly auctions. Companies must obtain enough permits to
cover their emissions as the pool gradually shrinks through
2020. Those with more than they need can trade the excess.  The sellout for 2016 permits “really shows that these
companies, probably the big  oil companies , are preparing for the
longevity of this market,” Emily Reyna, senior manager of
partnerships and alliances for the Environmental Defense Fund,
said by telephone from San Francisco.  The board also sold allowances that can be used as early as
this year, known as “Vintage 2013” permits, for $12.22 each
during the Aug. 16 auction. That was more than a dollar below
analysts’ forecasts and the lowest settlement for Vintage 2013
permits since the state’s first auction in November.  Futures based on 2013 allowances have slumped to the lowest
level this year as the board considers a plan to hand out more
free permits instead of selling them.  “It certainly appears that the market is bearish Phase
One,” Hochschild said.  2013 Allowances  The 2013 allowances were expected to go for about $13.25 a
ton, according to a July 31 forecast by Bloomberg New Energy
Finance, which projected $14.12 a ton in May. The state received
1.62 bids for every 2013 permit for sale, the lowest demand in
three auctions, the board’s report showed.  Futures contracts based on 2013 allowances for December
delivery dropped 10 cents to $13.25 a ton at 4:34 p.m.  New York 
time, the lowest since Dec. 10, according to data compiled by
 CME Group Inc. (CME)   Units of  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  were
among the companies qualified to buy permits in last week’s
auction, a report posted on the state Air Resources Board’s
website today showed. The agency doesn’t disclose the names of
winning bidders.  During the auctions, companies submit confidential bids for
the number of allowances they want at a specific price. The
highest bidder is awarded permits first, then the second-highest
and so on until the all of the permits for sale have been called
for. Then all bidders pay the price of the lowest winning offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
