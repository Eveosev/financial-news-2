The dollar advanced to a two-week
high against the yen as initial jobless claims over the past
month in the U.S. fell to a five-year low, boosting the case for
the  Federal Reserve  to reduce stimulus.  The U.S. currency gained as housing prices and a gauge of
leading indicators climbed a day after minutes of the Federal
Open Market Committee’s last meeting showed most members were
“broadly comfortable” with the plan to trim stimulus this
year.  India ’s rupee slumped to a record and Malaysia’s ringgit
fell to a three-year low. Sweden’s krona strengthened versus
most major counterparts as the  unemployment rate  declined.  “The minutes indicated nearly all the FOMC members were
backing Bernanke’s plan of tapering -- as it stands right now,
it’s going forward,”  Robert Lynch , a currency strategist at
HSBC Holdings Plc in New York, said in a phone interview.
“That’s given some support for the dollar.”  The dollar rose 1.1 percent to 98.72 yen at 5 p.m. in New
York after advancing to 98.81, the strongest level since Aug. 5.
The U.S. currency was little changed at $1.3356 per euro after
gaining as much as 0.4 percent. The euro climbed 1.1 percent to
131.84 yen after appreciating to 131.89 yen, the highest since
Aug. 2.  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index  advanced 0.2 percent to
1,028.31 after rising to 1,031.37, the highest since Aug. 2.  Rupee, Ringgit  Global funds have cut their holdings of Indian debt by
$10.1 billion since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first flagged
the tapering on May 22, leaving the rupee vulnerable to the
nation’s current-account deficit.  The rupee slid 0.9 percent to 64.6300 per dollar after
weakening to a record 65.56. The currency may drop to 68 or even
70 by next week,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in  Singapore  predicts.  Malaysia’s ringgit slumped 0.9 percent to 3.3155 per dollar
after depreciating to 3.3248, the weakest since June 2010.  “The market was extremely nervous and stressed in  emerging
markets ,”  Sebastien Galy , a senior currency strategist at
Societe Generale SA, said by phone from New York. “We went
through a very severe wave of risk management which has led to
volatility much higher, and emerging markets under severe
pressure.”  Real, Rand  The real rose as  Brazil  was set to authorize price
increases for diesel and gasoline, O Estado de S. Paulo reported
today, without saying where it got the information. The real
appreciated as much as 1.4 percent before adding 0.7 percent to
2.4362 per  U.S. dollar  after tumbling 2.5 percent yesterday to
the weakest since December 2008.  The rand climbed even as two South African labor unions
said their members may strike after wage talks with gold
producers remained stalled. The currency rose 1 percent to
10.2816 per dollar after plunging 2.3 percent yesterday, the
most since April.  The euro extended its advance against the yen after London-based Markit Economics said an index of services in the 17-nation region rose to 51 this month from 49.8 in July. A
composite gauge of services and manufacturing climbed to 51.7
from 50.5. Readings above 50 indicates expansion.  The krona rose against most of its major counterparts after
 Statistics Sweden  said the seasonally adjusted  unemployment rate 
dropped to 7.8 percent in July from a revised 7.9 percent the
previous month. The Swedish currency gained 0.8 percent to
8.7081 per euro and strengthened 0.4 percent to 6.1074 per
dollar.  ‘On Track’  The number of U.S. claims for  unemployment insurance  in the
month ended Aug. 17 declined to 330,500 a week on average, the
least since November 2007, a Labor Department report showed
today in  Washington . Compared with a week earlier, claims rose
by 13,000 to 336,000, in line with the median forecast of 48
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  An index of U.S.  house prices  climbed 0.7 percent in June
from a revised 0.8 percent gain the previous month, according to
the  Federal Housing Finance Agency , and the Conference Board’s
index of leading economic indicators increased 0.6 percent in
July.  “We think tapering is on track -- we haven’t seen any
deterioration to show otherwise,” Eric Viloria, senior currency
strategist for Gain Capital Group LLC in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “We’re seeing a decline in the euro
because it’s being driven more by these dollar factors and by
the expectations of tapering.”  Fed’s View  The FOMC will reduce its monthly purchases of $85 billion
in bonds at its next meeting on Sept. 17-18, according to 65
percent economists in an Aug. 9-13 Bloomberg survey. The median
estimate is a cut to $75 billion each month.  Minutes from the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s July 30-31
gathering, released yesterday, showed “almost all committee
members agreed that a change in the purchase program was not yet
appropriate,” and a few said “it might soon be time to slow
somewhat the pace of purchases as outlined in that plan.”  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $24 billion, compared with $21 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-Mexican peso exchange rate amounted to $3.5 billion,
the largest share of trades at 14 percent. Options on the U.S.
dollar-yen rate totaled $2.9 billion, or 12 percent.  Dollar-peso options trading was 138 percent more than the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Greenback-yen options
trading was 59 percent less than average.  The dollar appreciated 5.1 percent this year, the best
performer after the euro among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
advanced 6.6 percent, while the yen slumped 8.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
