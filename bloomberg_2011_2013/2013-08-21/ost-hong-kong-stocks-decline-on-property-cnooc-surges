Most  Hong Kong   stocks  dropped as
property and financial stocks led the decline.  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  surged
after beating earnings expectations.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.2 percent to 21,926.06 as of
9:32 a.m. in Hong Kong, with three shares falling for each that
rose on the 50-member gauge. The equity benchmark dropped the
most in seven weeks yesterday as outflows from  emerging markets 
accelerated amid concern the Federal Reserve will start reducing
stimulus next month.  The  Hang Seng Index  retreated 3 percent this year through
yesterday, the worst performer among developed markets tracked
by Bloomberg. The gauge traded at 10.5 times estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with 15 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Emerging-market stocks tumbled to a six-week low yesterday
as investors withdrew $8.4 billion from developing-nation
exchange-traded funds this year with weakening economies from
 India  to Indonesia fueling pessimism.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the  H-share index , lost 0.1 percent to 9,898.13 today. The gauge  fell
19 percent from a Feb. 1 high through yesterday. The index
traded at 1.2 times book value, compared with a five-year
average of 1.8.  Materials and energy companies led declines this year on
the Hang Seng Composite Index amid concern weaker expansion in
China will sap demand. Information-technology and utility shares
were the biggest gainers.  U.S. Shares  Futures on the S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent today. The gauge
rose 0.4 percent yesterday, snapping a four-day losing streak,
as retailers’ results surpassed estimates and investors awaited
signals on stimulus measures from the  Federal Reserve .  The Federal Open Market Committee will release minutes of
its July 30-31 meeting today, with investors seeking clues on
when the central bank will pare $85 billion in monthly asset
purchases. Officials will begin to curtail bond buying at their
Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. Global central bankers
meet in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 22-24 to discuss the
world economy and monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
