Alaska  North Slope crude
strengthened by the most since February 2011 after refiners
 increased  gross inputs in PADD 5, the U.S. West Coast, the oil’s
main market, and field maintenance lowered production.  ANS, a medium, sour crude used by refiners on the U.S. West
Coast, increased $1.50 to $5 a barrel over West Texas
Intermediate at 1:52 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Earlier this month, the oil sank to the
lowest premium to WTI in more than 30 months.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  said today maintenance continued at its
Kuparuk field, and summer maintenance by  BP Plc (BP/)  in Alaska was at
its peak on Aug. 15, the company reported. In recent months some
shippers have begun transporting less-expensive Bakken crude by
rail from  North Dakota  to West Coast refineries.  Gulf Coast grades were mixed. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s
premium rose 45 cents to $2.75 a barrel at 1:52 p.m. Light
Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI strengthened by 10 cents to
$3.40. Poseidon’s discount narrowed 25 cents to $2.60 below WTI.  Mars Blend’s discount widened by 70 cents to $2.40 a
barrel. The premium for Thunder Horse to WTI fell by 75 cents to
$1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
