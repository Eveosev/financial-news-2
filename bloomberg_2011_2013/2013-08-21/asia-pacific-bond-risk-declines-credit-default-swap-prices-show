The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 4.5 basis points to 155.5 basis
points as of 8:44 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is poised for its
biggest one-day fall since Aug. 5 and its lowest close since
Aug. 19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 3 basis points to
124 as of 10:26 a.m., according to Westpac Banking Corp. The
index is on course for its first decline since Aug. 14 and its
lowest close since Aug. 19, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 2 basis points to 98
basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index is also on track for its lowest close since Aug.
19, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
