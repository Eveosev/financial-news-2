Swiss stocks  were little changed,
after the benchmark  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  posted the longest losing
streak in 11 weeks, as investors awaited the release of minutes
from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting.  Basilea Pharmaceutica (BSLN)  AG advanced 1.2 percent after the
biotechnology company’s first-half net loss narrowed.  Adecco SA (ADEN) 
climbed 0.6 percent after Bryan Garnier & Co. upgraded its
recommendation for the world’s largest provider of temporary
workers.  Charles Voegele Holding AG (VCH)  declined 2.3 percent.  The SMI slipped 0.1 percent to 7,930.9 at 9:23 a.m. in
Zurich. The gauge has  gained  16 percent this year, driving its
valuation to 15.2 times estimated earnings, compared with an
average of 13 times over the past three years. The broader Swiss
Performance Index was also little changed today.  Investors awaited the minutes of the Federal Open Market
Committee’s July 30-31 meeting for signs of when the Fed will
begin to reduce the $85 billion pace of monthly bond purchases.
The U.S. central bank will start to scale back bond buying next
month, according to 65 percent of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. The median estimate called for
purchases to drop to $75 billion a month.  The Fed has said the  U.S. economy  must improve in line with
its forecasts for tapering to take place. A report at 10 a.m. in
Washington will show  existing house sales  rose 1.4 percent to an
annualized 5.15 million pace in July, according to the median
forecast of 75 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
