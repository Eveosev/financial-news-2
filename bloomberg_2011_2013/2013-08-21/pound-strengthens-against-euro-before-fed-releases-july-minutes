The pound rose to a two-month high
versus the dollar before the Federal Reserve releases minutes
that may provide a clue about when U.S. policy makers will
remove stimulus that has helped underpin global growth.  The U.K. currency advanced against 14 of its 16 major
counterparts even after a report showed Britain posted its first
July budget deficit since 2010 as government spending increased.
The pound erased its year-to-date decline today, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. U.K. gilts fell, pushing
benchmark 10-year yields toward the highest since August 2011.  “The pound could be fairly supported ahead of the Fed
minutes,” said Josh O’Byrne, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in  London . “We suspect they’ll follow on from
the more dovish tone set in the statement, highlighting higher
mortgage rates and downside risks from low inflation.”  The pound was little changed at $1.5673 at 4:26 p.m. London
time after rising to $1.5701, the highest since June 18. The
U.K. currency advanced 0.5 percent to 85.22 pence per euro after
appreciating to 85.05 on Aug. 15, the strongest since July 3.  The Fed will publish today its July 30-31 meeting minutes
that may offer clues on whether policy makers will start
reducing their $85 billion of monthly bond purchases. The
Federal Open Market Committee will probably decide to reduce the
program at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News from Aug. 9-13.  Budget Deficit  U.K.  net borrowing  excluding temporary support for banks
was 488 million pounds compared with a surplus of 823 million
pounds a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said.
Including coupon cash received from the Bank of England on its
holdings of gilts, the deficit was 62 million pounds.  The pound also rose as the Confederation of British
Industry said its measure of  new orders  at U.K. factories rose
to the highest in two years in August and expectations for the
next three months improved.  The CBI’s manufacturing gauge advanced to zero from minus
12 in July, it said in London today. A measure of output
expectations rose to 25 from 15, the highest since March 2011.  The pound has gained 0.7 percent this year after earlier
dropping as much as 6.9 percent, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation
currencies. The euro climbed 6.3 percent, while the dollar
strengthened 4.8 percent.  Economy Strengthening  The U.K. economy is showing signs of strengthening, with
indexes of manufacturing, services and construction all
improving in July and house prices rising amid the strongest
property market since the financial crisis.  Gross domestic product  increased 0.6 percent in the second
quarter, according to the median forecast of 34 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey before the Office for National Statistics
publishes the data on Friday. That’s in line with an earlier
reading released on July 25.  “The pound’s strength is justified by the better economic
data,” said Stuart Bennett, the head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy at Banco Santander SA in London. “The pound
was fairly valued given the economic backdrop, giving it some
scope to rise.”  The  10-year gilt yield  rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.71 percent after climbing to 2.75 percent
on Aug. 19, the highest since Aug. 8, 2011. The 1.75 percent
bond due in September 2022 fell 0.28, or 2.80 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 92.33.  Gilts lost investors 4.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
bonds dropped 2.1 percent and Treasuries declined 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
