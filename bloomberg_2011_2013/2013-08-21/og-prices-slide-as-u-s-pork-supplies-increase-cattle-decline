Hog futures dropped to the lowest in
more than a week on signs that cheaper  animal feed  is helping to
boost U.S. pork supplies. Cattle slumped.  The price of corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed,
has plunged 44 percent from a record $8.49 a bushel in August
2012. Meatpackers processed 398,000 hogs in the  Iowa  and
southern Minnesota region in the week ended Aug. 17, up 5.3
percent from a week earlier, Department of Agriculture data
show. Average carcass weights rose 1.6 percent from a year
earlier, according to the USDA.  “People are kind of looking for an increase in hog numbers
going through the fall,” Dick Quiter, an account executive at
McFarland Commodities LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. When feed costs drop, “pig-crop numbers tend to
increase, and the weights probably tend to go up” with lower
feed costs, he said.  Hog futures for October settlement retreated 0.9 percent to
86.075 cents a pound at 9:30 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest since Aug. 12.  Wholesale- pork  prices slumped 0.5 percent to $1.0183 a
pound yesterday, the lowest since July 31, USDA data show.  Cattle futures for October delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
$1.279 a pound. Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement
slid 0.1 percent to $1.58125 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
