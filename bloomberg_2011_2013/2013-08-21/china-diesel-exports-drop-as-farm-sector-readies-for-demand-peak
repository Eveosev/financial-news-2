China ’s net diesel exports fell to
the lowest level in nine months as the government restricted
shipments before demand peaks in the agricultural industry.  Overseas  sales  of the fuel exceeded imports by 119,181
metric tons in July, according to data e-mailed by the General
Administration of Customs in Beijing today. That’s equivalent to
28,900 barrels a day, the least since October, when net exports
declined to 107,277 tons, Bloomberg calculations show. It’s also
2.2 percent less than in June.  China, which consumes more oil than any country except the
U.S., shipped fewer diesel cargoes after the government cut
export quotas for China National Petroleum Corp. and  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) , its two biggest refiners. This is
meant to ensure sufficient supplies before an expected increase
in demand this quarter, according ICIS-C1 Energy, a Shanghai-based energy consultant.  “The country wants to tighten supply as September is the
agricultural peak season for diesel,” Li Li, an oil analyst at
ICIS-C1, said by phone from Guangzhou.  Agricultural consumption accounts for about 15 percent of
China’s diesel demand, according to the consultant. The farming
industry, which uses the fuel to run tractors and equipment,
made up 7.5 percent of the nation’s economy in the first half of
this year, official data show.  Fuel Oil  China’s imports of  fuel oil , used by ships and so-called
teapot oil refineries, dropped to 1.91 million tons in July,
down 5.1 percent from a year earlier, according to today’s
customs data. That’s the lowest level since last August.
Overseas purchases of the fuel climbed 1.8 percent to 16.4
million tons in the first seven months.  Russia was the biggest  fuel oil  supplier to China after it
shipped 567,990 tons, a 21 percent gain from a year earlier, the
data show.  Venezuela  exported 332,012 tons,  South Korea  sold
265,850 tons and  Singapore  delivered 252,454 tons.  Overseas sales of  gasoline  exceeded purchases by 313,364
tons in July, the least since December. Net exports of  jet-kerosene  rose to 259,890 tons, 59 percent more than in June.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
