Shane Watson’s century helped push
 Australia  to 183-3 at tea on the first day of the fifth and
final Ashes cricket Test against  England .  Watson, who struggled for runs in the previous four
matches, was not out on 121 at the Oval in London, his first
hundred in 25 Tests and his third overall. He was dropped by
England captain Alastair Cook on 104. Steven Smith was unbeaten
on 15.  England took two wickets in the afternoon session. Opener
Chris Rogers was caught off Graeme Swann for 23, while James Anderson bowled Australia captain Michael Clarke for seven.
Anderson has now taken 326 Test wickets, taking him above Bob
Willis to become England’s second-highest wicket-taker of all
time, behind Ian Botham.  England leads the series 3-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
