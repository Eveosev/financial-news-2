Natural gas futures rose in New York
on expectations that a blast of heat across the Midwest will
boost demand from  power plants .  Gas gained 0.5 percent after forecasts turned hotter from
the  Great Lakes  to  Montana , with temperatures expected to reach
the low 90s Fahrenheit (low 30s Celsius) from Aug. 26 through
Aug. 30, according to MDA Weather Services. Large cities along
the East Coast may see seasonal weather next week, the
Gaithersburg, Maryland-based company said.  “The market is pricing in a little bit of the cooling
demand we are going to see in the next week and a half in the
Midwest and the Northeast,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “It’ll
probably force some of the shorts out of the market.”  Natural gas for September delivery rose 1.6 cents to settle
at $3.46 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 25 percent below the 100-day
average at 2:43 p.m. Gas is up 3.3 percent this year.  The discount of September to October futures widened 0.2
cent to 3.1 cents, the biggest such gap since Feb. 28. October
gas traded 39.1 cents below the January contract, compared with
39.6 cents yesterday.  September $3.50 calls were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were up 0.2 cent at 4.2 cents per
million Btu on volume of 447 at 3:35 p.m. Calls accounted for 45
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money
options expiring in October was 32.73 percent at 3:15 p.m.,
compared with 33.02 percent yesterday.  Price Rally  Gas prices  have rebounded 11 percent since dropping to a
five-month intraday low of $3.129 per million Btu on Aug. 8 as
an unusually mild start to the month gave way to hot and humid
weather from the Northeast into the West Coast.  “The recent rally may have run its course for now,”  John Kilduff , partner at Again Capital LLC and editor of the Energy
OverView newsletter in New York, wrote today. “The injection
report tomorrow should finish off the rally, and selling is
advised on any rally above $3.50.”  The high temperature in  Chicago  on Aug. 29 may be 91
degrees, 10 above normal, and the day New York may climb from
seasonal temperatures to 89 degrees, 9 higher than the average,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Power Plants  Electricity generators account for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Gas inventories probably expanded by 66 billion cubic feet
last week, based on the median of 21  analyst estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. The five-year average gain for the seven days is
56 billion, EIA data show. Supplies rose 43 billion the same
time last year.  U.S. stockpiles  totaled 3.006 trillion in the week ended
Aug. 9, 1.5 percent above the five-year average for the period,
the EIA reported last week. The  deficit  versus the historic norm
widened from 0.7 percent the previous week while a  deficit 
versus year-earlier levels narrowed to 7.7 percent from 9.2
percent.  Natural gas production  in the lower-48 states was little
changed in May as new wells began operating in the Northeast’s
Marcellus shale formation while Wyoming production declined
during scheduled maintenance, government data showed last month.  The EIA expects marketed gas output to climb for a sixth
straight year to yield a record 69.89 billion cubic feet a day,
up 1 percent from 2012, according to its Short-Term Energy
Outlook released Aug. 6.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first four months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1985, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
