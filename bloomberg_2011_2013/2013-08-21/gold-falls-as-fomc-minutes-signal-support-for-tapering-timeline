Gold futures in  New York  fell after
regular trading as the  Federal Reserve  released minutes from its
July meeting showing officials support Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke ’s timeline for reducing stimulus.  Federal Open Market Committee policy makers were “broadly
comfortable” with Bernanke’s plan to start reducing bond buying
later this year if the economy improves, with a few saying
tapering might be needed soon, the minutes showed. The FOMC will
probably reduce its monthly purchases at its Sept. 17-18
meeting, according to 65 percent of economists in an Aug. 9-13
Bloomberg survey.  “Officials seem to be on board with what Bernanke thinks
the timeline should be,”  Bart Melek , the head of commodity
strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said in a telephone
interview. “It doesn’t look like you’re going to get a lot of
new longs coming into the market at this point.”  Gold futures for December delivery slid 0.1 percent to
$1,370.80 an ounce in electronic trading at 3:13 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. The metal earlier settled down 0.2 percent at
$1,370.10 at the close of regular trading.  Gold has tumbled 18 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value and on speculation
that the Fed may cut the $85 billion in monthly asset purchases
that, along with record-low  interest rates , helped send bullion
on a 12-year bull run through 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
