SDE Energy Ltd., a Tel Aviv-based
maker of wave-power technology, plans to build a $100 million
electricity plant in  Guinea .  The Israeli company agreed with the government of the West
African nation to install a 100-megawatt power station, Shmuel Ovadia, chief executive officer of SDE, said today by e-mail.
Construction in Conakry will begin when funds are raised, the
CEO said, without saying how long he expects this to take.  SDE will cover 70 percent of the costs and the government
the rest, he said. Electricity will be transmitted to the grid
and the facility may be expanded in the future.  As little as 0.1 percent of the power of the worldâ€™s waves
may be able to supply five times its energy needs, according to
the  European Commission . No utility-scale projects are working
yet as the technology is still experimental.  So far wave-energy costs work out at about $496 a megawatt-hour, according to Bloomberg estimates. The figure compares with
about $78 a megawatt-hour for coal-fired power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
