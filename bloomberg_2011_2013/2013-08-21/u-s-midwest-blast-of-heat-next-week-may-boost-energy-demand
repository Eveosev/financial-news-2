Temperatures may reach into the low
90s Fahrenheit (low 30s Celsius) across the Midwest next week,
giving a boost to energy demand,  MDA Weather Services  said.  Readings from  Montana  to the Great Lakes, including Chicago
and Minneapolis, are expected to be 8 degrees above normal or
more from Aug. 26 to Aug. 30, according to the Gaithersburg,
Maryland-based company.  “The forecast has again trended hotter in the Midwest,
where it looks more likely that much-aboves will last through
the period,” MDA said. The warm-up will probably result “in
plenty of cooling demand,” it said.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas use,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  The higher readings in the Midwest may linger through Sept.
4, although the heat won’t be as intense, with temperatures 3 to
5 degrees above normal, MDA said.  The large cities along the East Coast, including New York,
are expected to have seasonal temperatures next week.  The normal average temperature in New York City on Aug. 28
is 75 degrees, MDA said. In Boston it’s 70 degrees; in  Chicago ,
71; St. Louis, 78; Houston, 84;  Seattle , 65; and Burbank,
 California , 76.  To contact the reporter on this story:
