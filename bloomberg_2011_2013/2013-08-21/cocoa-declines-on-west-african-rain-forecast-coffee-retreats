Cocoa fell the most in more than a
week in New York on forecasts for rain in the main growing
region of West Africa, which may alleviate recent dryness.
Robusta coffee declined.  Rain may be seen in northern parts of the cocoa belt in
 Ivory Coast , the world’s top producer, MDA Weather Services,
based in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in an e-mailed report
yesterday. Scattered thunderstorms from Ivory Coast to Nigeria
and  Cameroon  through tomorrow will total 0.2 to 0.6 inch a day,
AccuWeather said in a report today.  “We are in a bit of a weather market,” Sterling Smith, a
futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago  said by e-mail.
The weather has been unusually dry for the last two months and
we’re now coming into a period where we should see more rain, he
said.  Cocoa for delivery in December fell 1.7 percent, the most
since Aug. 13, to $2,477 a metric ton by 9:18 a.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . Cocoa for delivery in the same month
slumped 1.8 percent to 1,631 pounds ($2,560) a ton on NYSE Liffe
in London.  Money managers’ bullish bets on cocoa traded in London
reached a 10-month high in the week ended Aug. 13, exchange data
 showed .  “The drop may be over done a bit,” Smith said.
“Speculators are a little nervous and are willing to take
profits on the first bit of scary news in terms of what we get
about moisture.”  Arabica coffee for delivery in December was little changed
at $1.1875 a pound on ICE after falling as much as 3.3 percent
yesterday. Robusta coffee for November delivery slid 0.8 percent
to $1,835 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Raw sugar for delivery in October was little changed at
16.46 cents a pound in New York. White sugar for delivery in the
same month was little changed at $488.10 a ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
