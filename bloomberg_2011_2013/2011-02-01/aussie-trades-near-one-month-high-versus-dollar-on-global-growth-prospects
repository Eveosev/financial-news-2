  Australia ’s dollar fell from almost a
one-month high as Cyclone Yasi, with winds stronger than  Hurricane Katrina  that hit  New Orleans , reached the country’s
northeast coastline.  The Aussie weakened against the greenback as thousands of
people evacuated low-lying areas in the city of Cairns before
Yasi makes landfall. The storm is estimated to be more powerful
than a 2006 storm that wiped out most of Australia’s banana crop
and devastated sugar cane fields.  “The cyclone is probably weighing on Aussie,” said  Amelia Bourdeau , a currency strategist in Stamford, Connecticut, at UBS
AG. “In addition to the floods in Queensland, this may be
something that negatively impacts the first quarter gross
domestic product in Australia.”  Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0068 as of 11:45 a.m. in  New York , down from $1.0111 yesterday when it touched $1.0149,
the highest level since Jan. 4. The currency bought 82.21 yen
from 82.26 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar fetched 78.02 U.S. cents from 78.14
cents yesterday, when it reached 78.26, the strongest since Nov.
22. It was at 63.70 yen from 63.57 yen.  Recovery Effort  Queensland is beginning a recovery effort estimated to cost
at least A$5 billion ($5 billion) as its economy prepares for
slower growth because of flooding since November.  New Zealand’s dollar, known as the kiwi, was close to the
highest level in 10 weeks as whole milk powder prices rose to an
eight-month high.  Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the world’s largest dairy
exporter, said whole milk powder prices gained 7.6 percent from
two weeks earlier, reaching the highest since June 1, according
to auction results published today.  The  New Zealand  dollar gained for a second day versus the
yen before data that may show employment increased by 2 percent
in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
