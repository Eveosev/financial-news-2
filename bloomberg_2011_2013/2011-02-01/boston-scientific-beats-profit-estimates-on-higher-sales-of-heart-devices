  Boston Scientific Corp . declined the
most in almost six months in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading after its chief executive officer predicted a
“difficult” year in which the economy will drag on sales of
defibrillators and heart stents.  Boston Scientific, the second-largest heart-device maker,
slipped 28 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $6.85 at 4:01 p.m., for its
biggest one-day drop since August. The shares have lost 18
percent over the past year.  Profit may be hurt because it will be harder to increase
prices for defibrillators and artery-clearing stents, Chief
Executive Officer Ray Elliott said in a conference call with
analysts today. Also, spending will increase because of the
introduction of new products and an expansion of the sales force
outside the U.S., he said. The Natick, Massachusetts-based
company also may not have the benefit of a  tax rate  that was
lower than predicted and helped boost 2010 earnings.  This year “will be a difficult but necessary transition
year to set the table for 2012 through 2015,” Elliott said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
