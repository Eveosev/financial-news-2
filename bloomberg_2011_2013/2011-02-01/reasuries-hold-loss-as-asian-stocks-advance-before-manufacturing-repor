Treasury 10-year yields were at the
highest level since April as the U.S. prepared to sell $24
billion of the notes today, after demand from the group of
bidders that includes central banks fell at an auction yesterday.    U.S. debt  maturing in 10 years and longer has handed
investors a 1.9 percent loss in the past five days, the biggest
decline of 174 indexes of sovereign bonds around the world,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors are seeking
higher yields in company debt as the  U.S. economy  improves,
highlighted by a decline in the  unemployment rate  to a 21-month
low in January.  “We’re favoring corporate bonds,” said Marc Fovinci, who
helps oversee $2.8 billion as head of fixed income at Ferguson
Wellman Capital Management Inc. in Portland, Oregon. “In an
expanding economy, they’ll do fine.”  Ten-year notes yielded 3.75 percent as of 10:01 a.m. in
Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent
security maturing in November 2020 traded at a price of 90 27/32.
The last time the rate was so high was April 30.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to
testify today before the House Budget Committee amid speculation
about how the central bank will pull back from the debt-buying
program it implemented to spur growth.  Three-Year Sale  Treasuries fell yesterday after the $32 billion auction of
three-year debt, the first of three sales this week.  “The assumption is if the three-year can’t go well, then
people are readjusting their positions and their outlook for the
Fed,” said  Michael Franzese , managing director and head of
Treasury trading at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in  New York .
“The Fed may be more aggressive in tightening.”  The three-year auction drew a yield of 1.349 percent,
compared with a forecast of 1.345 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of 8 of the Fed’s 20 primary dealers.  Indirect bidders, the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 27.6 percent of the notes, dropping from
39.4 percent in January.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
bids with the amount of securities available, was 3.01, compared
with an average of 3.15 for the previous 10 sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
