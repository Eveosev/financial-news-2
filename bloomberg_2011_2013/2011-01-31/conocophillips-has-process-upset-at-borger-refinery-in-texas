  ConocoPhillips  reduced processing
rates yesterday at its Borger refinery in the  Texas  Panhandle
because of subfreezing temperatures, according to two people
familiar with refinery operations.  So many of the refinery’s units were freezing up that the
decision was made to cut rates plantwide, said the people, who
declined to be identified because they are not authorized to
speak for ConocoPhillips.  Bill Stephens, a spokesman for the company in Houston,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Borger is the second Texas refinery that has reduced rates
because of the cold weather. Alon USA Energy Inc. cut rates at
its Big Spring refinery in Texas to between 50,000 and 55,000
barrels a day because of the weather, Joseph  Israel , the
company’s chief operating officer, said in an e-mail today. The
refinery is located about 300 miles west of Dallas.  The refinery is “fighting the extreme weather conditions in
our Big Spring refinery with focus on safety and balancing
operations through slightly reduced” rates, he said.  The Borger refinery, located about 50 miles northeast of
Amarillo, can process 146,000 barrels of crude a day, according
to the Houston-based company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
