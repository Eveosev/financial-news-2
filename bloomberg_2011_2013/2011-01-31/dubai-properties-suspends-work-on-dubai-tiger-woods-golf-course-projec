  Tiger Woods  was paid $55.4 million
by United Arab Emirates developer Tatweer to promote a golf
resort project that was suspended last month, Arabian
Business reported, citing documents seen by the magazine.  The potential value of agreements between the golferâ€™s
company, Eldrick Tiger Woods, and the developer was $98.8
million, Arabian Business said. That included a fee of more than
$14 million due within 10 days of Woods appearing at the
official opening of Tiger Woods Dubai, according to the report.  The $1.1 billion resort, including 287 luxury villas and
mansions, a boutique hotel and golf course, was originally
scheduled to open in September 2009.  Tatweer and Sama Dubai were merged in August 2009 under
Dubai Properties Group. A spokesman for Dubai Properties
declined to comment on the report.  -- With reporting by Zainab Fattah in Dubai. Editor: Shaji Mathew.  To contact the reporter on this story:
