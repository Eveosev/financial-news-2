European  diesel  barges dropped from
a four-week high as North Sea Group sold for a second day.  KLM-Air  France  sold jet fuel barges for a second day as
prices were unchanged. OAO Lukoil’s Litasco sold 30,000 tons of
gasoil to Trafigura Beheer BV.  Light Products  Gasoline’s premium to Brent, or its crack, rose to the
highest in more than seven weeks. It was at $2.43 a barrel as of
4:51 p.m.  London  time, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
London-based broker. That’s the most since Oct. 31.  U.S.  gasoline consumption  rose by 2.5 percent in the week
to Dec. 16, the Energy Department said yesterday. That’s the
biggest rise since the week ended May 27, the data show.  Gasoline for immediate loading in northwest Europe traded
from $916 to $921 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and
Platts pricing window. That’s up from yesterday’s highest deal
at $912 for the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added before
being sold to motorists.  Those prices are for barge lots, which are usually 1,000 or
2,000 tons.  Middle Distillates  Diesel, which trades at a differential to gasoil futures on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London, dropped relative to
that measure. PetroChina Co. bought for at least a ninth day.  Barges traded at a premium of $18 to January gasoil, the
survey showed. Yesterday’s transactions were from $21 to $23,
the highest since Nov. 24, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  China Petrochemical Corp., also known as Sinopec, said
today it would process a record volume of crude this year,
partly to rising demand for diesel.  KLM-Air France sold jet fuel to Vitol Group and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc at a premium of $63 to January gasoil, the survey
showed. That unchanged from yesterday, when the carrier also
sold to Vitol.  Litasco sold a cargo of gasoil to Trafigura for delivery to
the Slovenian port of Koper from Jan. 7 to Jan. 11, according to
the survey.  Gasoil for January delivery added $7.75, or 0.9 percent, to
$915.25 a ton on ICE as of 5:09 p.m. London time. Barges of the
heating fuel traded at parity and a $1 premium to the front-
month futures contract, little changed from yesterday.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded from $616 to $620 a ton, the
survey showed. Yesterday’s highest deal for the shipping fuel
was at $616.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
