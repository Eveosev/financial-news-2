The U.S. is about to admit that it
bore “significant responsibility” for the Nov. 26 air strike
in an Afghan border area that resulted in the deaths of 24
Pakistani soldiers, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified U.S. officials familiar with the report of a
military investigation.  The investigation concluded that U.S. and Afghan commandos
incorrectly judged that no Pakistani forces were in the area,
thus confirming key elememnts in  Pakistan ’s version of events,
the newspaper said.  Initial U.S. accounts were based on preliminary and
incomplete debriefings of service members, the Journal said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
