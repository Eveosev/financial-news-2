(Corrects  Kenya ’s currency move in headline.)  Uganda ’s shilling, the currency of
 East Africa ’s third-largest economy, weakened against the dollar
for second straight day, the first two-day decline in almost a
month.  The shilling depreciated 0.3 percent to 2,397 per dollar by
9:33 a.m. in the capital, Kampala. The currency gained or was
unchanged for 11 trading days until yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Tanzania’s shilling also fell for the second day, slipping
0.3 to 1,590.43 against the dollar, heading for its biggest drop
in a week. Kenya’s shilling appreciated less than 0.1 percent to
83.55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
