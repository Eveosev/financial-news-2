The euro region’s sovereign debt
crisis will ease next year and the common currency will still be
around in five years after leaders earlier this month agreed to
have their budgets monitored more closely, Michael Huether, head
of the business-sponsored IW economic institute, told
 WirtschaftsWoche  magazine.  While  Germany ’s economic situation will be difficult next
year, there won’t be a slump comparable to 2009, the magazine
cited Huether as saying in an e-mailed advance copy of an
article. There’s no danger of a credit crunch in Germany,
Huether said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
