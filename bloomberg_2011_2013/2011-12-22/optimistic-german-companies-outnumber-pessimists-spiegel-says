The share of small and medium-sized
German companies that expect business to be better in 2012 than
this year is larger than those that expect business to worsen,
 Der Spiegel  magazine said, citing a survey by the DIHK industry
and trade federation.  Twenty-three percent of the companies surveyed said they
expect business to improve, while 16 percent said it will
deteriorate, Spiegel said today in an e-mailed advance copy of
an article. Companies plan to create 200,000 jobs next year, it
said.  Forty-four percent of the companies said their business
situation is “good,” while 9 percent said it is “bad.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
