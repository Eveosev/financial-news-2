Toyota Motor Corp. said its vehicle
sales may rise the most in at least 12 years in 2012 as  Asia ’s
biggest carmaker recovers from production disruptions caused by
 Japan ’s March earthquake and  Thailand ’s record flooding.  The maker of Prius hybrid cars may boost global deliveries
20 percent to 8.48 million vehicles from an estimated 7.05
million in 2011, it said in a statement today. The forecast
excludes Toyota’s Hino Motors Ltd. and Daihatsu Motor Co. units.  Toyota, poised to lose its crown as the world’s biggest
automaker this year to  General Motors Co. (GM) , aims to recover
 market share  lost after natural disasters disrupted its supply
chain, causing parts shortages that shuttered factories and left
car dealers short of inventory. The strong yen, which is
reducing Toyota’s export earnings, and slowing economic growth
in the U.S. and  China  may hamper its efforts.  “The sales forecast is much higher than I expected, and to
be honest, I doubt they can achieve the target,”  Kohei Takahashi , a Tokyo-based auto analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
said today by phone. “The yen has gotten much stronger and they
won’t be able to make any profit exporting cars.”  Global production may rise 24 percent next year to 8.65
million vehicles, of which 3.4 million will be built in Japan,
Toyota said in today’s statement. Total output  fell (7203)  an estimated
9 percent to 6.97 million units this year, while vehicle sales
dropped 6 percent, the carmaker said.  Profit Forecast  The projected sales increase for next year would be the
biggest since at least 2000, Dion Corbett, a spokesman for
Toyota, said today in an e-mail.  Declining sales and gains in the yen prompted the carmaker
to cut its profit forecast by more than half for the fiscal year
ending March 31. Net income for the 12 months ending March 31
may decrease 56 percent to 180 billion yen ($2.3 billion), the
company said Dec. 9.  The reduced forecast came after Ford Motor Co. declared its
first quarterly dividend since 2006 and Detroit-based GM boosted
sales 9.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2011.  Toyota fell 0.9 percent to 2,488 yen as of 1:28 p.m. in
 Tokyo  trading, extending a 23 percent drop this year. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 0.6 percent.  Nissan’s Forecast  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second-largest carmaker, raised
its profit forecast last month after the company’s vehicle sales
in China increased and as it recovered faster than Toyota from
the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.  Toyota probably lost more output than any other carmaker
because of the Thai floods, according to Masatoshi Nishimoto, a
Tokyo-based senior manager at research firm IHS Automotive.  The automaker is set to introduce a plug-in version of its
Prius, the world’s best-selling hybrid, in Japan next month and
in the U.S. in March.  Toyota’s November U.S. vehicle sales rose for the first
time in seven months as supply at dealers recovered and consumer
confidence in the world’s largest economy surged the most in
more than eight years.  The Japanese currency has gained 4 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  this year and traded at 78.05 as of 1:44 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
