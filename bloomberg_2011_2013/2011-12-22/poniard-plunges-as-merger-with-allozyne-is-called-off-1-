Poniard Pharmaceuticals Inc. (PARD) 
declined after agreeing with Allozyne Inc. to end a planned
merger because the combined shares wouldn’t qualify for a stock
market listing.  Being listed was a condition for closing the deal announced
on June 22, South San Francisco, California-based Poniard said
in a statement today. The company’s board is “exploring
alternatives” for its assets, according to the statement.  Poniard and closely held Allozyne, based in  Seattle , would
have combined in an all-stock exchange to support Allozyne’s
product pipeline and spin off Poniard’s experimental drug
picoplantin. The medicine didn’t help lung cancer patients live
longer, according to a November 2009 trial.  Poniard dropped 1.7 percent to $2.90 at the close of New
York trading, after falling as much as 35 percent. The stock has
declined 86 percent this year, leaving the company with a market
value of $4.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
