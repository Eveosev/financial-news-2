The board of  England ’s Football
Association approved the appointment of a woman for the first
time since the world’s oldest national soccer governing body was
founded in 1863.  The F.A. board unanimously agreed to add Heather Rabbatts
and Roger Devlin as independent directors. The decision will now
be put early next year before the F.A. Council, a 92-member
panel responsible for major policies.  “This is an important moment for the F.A. and represents a
significant change to our governance structures,” chairman
 David Bernstein  said in a statement.  The appointments come after the publication of a report on
soccer governance by lawmakers, who spent more than a year
examining the sport. U.K. Sports Minister Hugh Robertson
threatened government intervention unless reforms were made and
the F.A., Premier League and Football League have said they’ll
work together to suggest changes.  Rabbatts, 56, a former deputy chairman of second-division
team Millwall, and Devlin, 54, a former banker and media
executive, are the first independent directors to join the
board.  “Having worked across media, business and football I hope
to bring those experiences to my work at The F.A.,” said
Rabbatts, who’s also held non-executive positions at the British
Broadcasting Corp., the  Bank of England  and the Royal Opera
House. Devlin has acted as a financial adviser to several
Premier League clubs.  If the appointments are approved the existing board will
expand from 12 to 14 members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
