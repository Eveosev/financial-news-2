Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s government will aim for 2 percent real growth until
fiscal 2020 by creating special economic zones as the country
recovers from the March 11 earthquake and nuclear disaster.  The government will set up seven such districts to promote
innovative industries throughout the country as well as 26 areas
in places hit by the earthquake and tsunami, according to a plan
approved today. Noda’s administration will also aim to submit a
bill next year to create a unified market that can trade
securities, financial and commodity products.  Noda is seeking to revive an economy threatened by the
European debt crisis and the strong yen while keeping the
world’s largest public debt from expanding. The government today
projected  Japan ’s  gross domestic product  will expand 2.2 percent
in the year beginning April 1, 2012 after shrinking 0.1 percent
this year.  The government will consider and promote measures to help
stabilize global financial markets, the paper said, and
coordinate closely with the  Bank of Japan .  Tax breaks will be offered in an area around Nagoya to
boost aerospace companies, while the Yokohama area will promote
the medical industry, the plan said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
