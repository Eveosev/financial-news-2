Soybeans capped the longest rally
since July and corn rose to a one-month high on speculation that
hot, dry weather is hurting crops in  South America . Wheat gained
for the fifth straight session.  As much as 40 percent of  Argentina ’s corn-growing region
will remain under stress for at least two weeks because
overnight rains were lighter than expected, the Commodity
Weather Group LLC said in a report. In Brazil, a quarter of the
corn and soybean crops will remain under stress after showers in
the next four days, the private forecaster said.  “The market is adding some weather premium because the
crop potential is declining in South America,” Jason Ward, a
market analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “The corn and
soybean crops are entering the most important period for
determining yields.”  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to
close at $11.7175 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the sixth straight gain and the longest rally since July
15. The price earlier touched $11.775, the highest since Nov.
18.  Corn futures for March delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$6.175 a bushel on the CBOT, capping the first five-session gain
since mid-May. Earlier, the most-active contract jumped as much
as 1.4 percent $6.25, the highest since Nov. 18.  Record Corn Crop  Prices pared gains on speculation that record global
production will reduce the impact from a drop in South American
output, said  Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst for
AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,  Illinois .  Global  corn  output will rise 4.8 percent to 867.5 million
metric tons in the season that began Oct. 1, the sixth straight
record crop, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said Dec. 9.
With harvests expanding in  Australia ,  Canada , Russia and
Ukraine, world  wheat  production may rise 5.7 percent to an all-
time high, boosting reserve inventories before the 2012 harvest
to the highest in 12 years.  Corn futures may fall 31 percent to $4.305, according to
the median of 24 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.
Prices are down 1.8 percent in 2011.  The U.S. was the world’s largest producer and exporter of
corn and soybeans in the season that ended Sept. 30. The USDA
says  Brazil  will top the U.S. this year as the largest shipper
of soybeans. Argentina is the second-biggest corn exporter after
the U.S.  Wheat futures for March delivery rose 0.8 percent to
$6.2175 a bushel, after gaining 6.5 percent the prior four
sessions. The grain has fallen 22 percent this year on rising
world production and slowing demand for U.S. supplies.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion. Wheat was in fourth
place, at $13 billion, behind hay, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
