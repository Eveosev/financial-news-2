Philippine bonds gained for a sixth
day and the peso held steady after a government report showed
that the  budget deficit  narrowed.  The nation’s 11-month shortfall was 96 billion pesos ($2.2
billion), compared with 269.8 billion pesos a year earlier, the
government said yesterday. Foreign-currency reserves may rise to
$79 billion in 2012, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said
in Manila yesterday, from $76.2 billion last month.  “The  Philippines  has a good fiscal position and reserves
are going to be at record levels this year,” said Joey
Cuyegkeng, an economist at ING Groep NV in Manila.  The yield on the government’s 5.75 percent bonds due
November 2021 fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point,
to 5.326 percent, according to noon fixing prices from the
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. That’s the lowest level for
a benchmark 10-year note since at least 1998, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The peso closed at 43.63 per dollar in  Manila , compared
with 43.645 yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It
reached 44.323 on Dec. 15, the weakest level since Jan. 31.  The currency fell as much as 0.24 percent earlier on
speculation European banks will reduce investments in Asia as
they boost capital in response to their region’s debt crisis.  The  European Central Bank  awarded 489 billion euros ($640
billion) of loans to euro-area banks yesterday for three years,
the most ever in a single operation and more than the median
estimate of 293 billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. The peso has lost 0.7 percent since the end of June
amid concern the European Union debt crisis will cool demand for
Asian exports.  “Probably some EU banks are continuing to reduce their
positions in  Asia ,” ING’s Cuyegkeng said. ‘The external
environment remains quite challenging.’’  Exports, the nation’s largest source of foreign exchange,
dropped 14.6 percent in October from a year earlier after
falling a revised 27 percent in September, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
