Japan  bought 60,720 metric tons of
milling wheat from  Australia  in a regular tender today, the
smallest volume in nine months, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries said.  Shipments for the grain, so-called Standard White wheat,
are set from Jan. 16 to Feb. 15, Toshiki Tojo at the ministry’s
grain-trade division said by phone. It was the smallest purchase
since March 17, when the government bought 32,381 tons, data
from the ministry showed.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is Asia’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It plans to hold the next tender for
milling wheat in January, Tojo said.  The ministry has bought 3.48 million tons of milling wheat
through regular tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16
million tons in the year ended March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
