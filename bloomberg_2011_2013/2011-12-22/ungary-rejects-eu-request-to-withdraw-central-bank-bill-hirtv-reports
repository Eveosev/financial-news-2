Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor
Orban  rejected European Commission President Jose Manuel
Barroso’s request to withdraw two bills the trading bloc and the
International Monetary Fund cited for breaking off talks on a
financing package.  There is “no means” to delay a draft central bank law and
a separate bill on the merger of the central bank and the
financial authority, Orban told HirTV in an interview today.  The EU, the IMF, the  European Central Bank  and the
Hungarian central bank said the bills may undermine monetary
policy independence.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
