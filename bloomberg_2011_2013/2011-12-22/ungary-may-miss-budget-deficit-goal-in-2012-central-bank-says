Hungary will probably overshoot its
 budget-deficit  target next year, the central bank said in a
report today.  The shortfall may be 3.7 percent of gross domestic product,
compared with the government’s 2.5 percent goal, the Magyar
Nemzeti Bank said. The gap may be reduced to 2.6 percent with
the “complete cancellation” of budget reserves and assuming no
unexpected spending and no shortfall in revenue in 2012.  A decline in  risk premium  may allow keeping the  benchmark
interest rate  unchanged at 7 percent, the highest in the
European Union, or its “cautious reduction,” the central bank
said in the report, citing the rate-setting Monetary Council.
The rate may have to be “permanently” higher if the pace of
 disinflation  is slower than the bank’s forecast.  The central bank raised its benchmark  interest rate  to 7
percent from 6.5 percent on Dec. 20. Policy makers said they may
boost borrowing costs further if risk perception and the
inflation outlook deteriorate “substantially.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
