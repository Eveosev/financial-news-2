Norway’s Board of Forensic Medicine
approved a psychiatric evaluation that found mass murderer
Anders Behring Breivik insane after killing 77 people in a July
22 bombing attack and a shooting spree.  “There are no significant comments on the evaluation,”
the board, led by psychiatrist Karl Heinrik Melle, said in a
 one-sentence opinion  released today by Oslo District Court.  The 243-page evaluation released last month concluded that
Breivik suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, meaning the 32-
year-old may be placed in compulsory psychiatric treatment,
potentially for life, rather than prison. He still faces a trial
in April to establish guilt.  Breivik has admitted to the July bombing of Oslo government
offices and killing 69 people at a  Labor Party  youth camp south
of the Norwegian capital. Breivik has said that he sought to
inflict the “greatest possible loss” to the ruling Labor Party
and railed in a manifesto posted on the Internet against
“cultural Marxism” and “Islamization.”  -- Editors: Meera Bhatia, Jonas Bergman  To contact the reporter on this story:
