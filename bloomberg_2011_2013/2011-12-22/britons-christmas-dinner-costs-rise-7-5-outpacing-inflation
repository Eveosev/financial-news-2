Britons are seeing the cost of their
Christmas dinner rise faster than overall inflation this holiday
season as prices for wine, bacon and some desserts surge.  The average price of a basket of ingredients that make up
the holiday meal, which includes turkey, chicken, potatoes and
champagne, rose 7.5 percent in November from a year earlier, the
 Office for National Statistics  said in a statement in London
today. U.K.  inflation  was at 4.8 percent last month.  Consumers are being squeezed as price gains outpace wage
growth and the government implements the biggest budget cuts
since World War II. Bank of England Mervyn King has said the
pressure on consumers should ease next year as inflation slows
“sharply” toward the central bank’s 2 percent target amid an
economic slowdown in the euro area.  The price of turkey steaks increased 3.8 percent in
November from a year earlier, while the price of chilled chicken
advanced 7.2 percent, the statistics office said. The largest
gains included cream crackers, ground filter coffee, sponge cake
and European red wine, which jumped 14.2 percent.  Out of the list of 22 products, only the cost of potatoes,
carrots and fresh double cream fell.  The list of ingredients was taken from the basket of goods
used by the ONS to calculate inflation each month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
