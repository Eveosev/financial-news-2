Egypt’s shares fell to the lowest
level since 2009 after Moody’s Investors Service reduced the
country’s credit rating for the fourth time this year and said
the political and economic crisis may result in more downgrades.  Talaat Moustafa Group Holding (TMGH) , Egypt’s biggest publicly
traded real-estate developer, tumbled 3.5 percent.  Commercial
International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI)  fell to the lowest close since
April 2009. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  retreated 2.4 percent to
3,614.04, the lowest since March 2009, at the 2:30 p.m. close in
Cairo. The index has lost 49 percent this year.  Moody’s decision yesterday to cut Egypt’s rating one level
to B2, five levels below investment grade, followed a week of
protests and clashes in Cairo that killed 15 people. Protesters
demand an immediate end to the military rule. The military,
which took over from President  Hosni Mubarak  in February after a
popular revolt, has promised to hand over power to an elected
president next year.  “There is so much negative news, whether concerning local
political events and security or the economy, and it’s weighing
more and more on the market,” said Mohamed Radwan, head of
international sales at Pharos Holding for Financial Investment
in Cairo.  Talaat Moustafa declined to 3 pounds, while Commercial
International Bank tumbled 3.3 percent to 19.29 pounds.  Moody’s (MCO)  said the main driver for its decision was the
“continued unsettled political conditions.” Egypt’s rating
could be reduced further if foreign-currency reserves, which
tumbled 44 percent in the first 11 months of this year to $20.2
billion, continue to drop at a similar pace, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
