Brazil plans to indict  Chevron Corp. (CVX) 
employees involved in exploratory drilling that triggered an oil
leak hundreds of miles offshore last month, the company said.  Chevron will defend its employees in the matter,  Kurt Glaubitz , a spokesman for the  San Ramon , California-based
company, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company by market
value, has been fined 50 million reais ($26.9 million) and
ordered to halt all drilling and crude production off Brazil’s
coast after oil seeped from sea floor fissures near its $3.6
billion Frade development.  “We will vigorously defend the company and its
employees,” Glaubitz said in the e-mailed statement. “Chevron
is confident that once all the facts are fully examined, they
will demonstrate that Chevron responded appropriately and
responsibly to the incident.”  Last month, Chevron estimated the volume of the seeps at
3,000 barrels (126,000 gallons) over the eight days it took for
the company to locate and halt the leaks.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  of Irving, Texas, is the biggest U.S.
energy company by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
