North Korea  will become more open
under Kim Jong Un compared with the rule of his late father,
according to almost half of South Koreans who responded to an
opinion poll.  Of 532 South Korean adults surveyed Dec. 20, 48 percent
said they expect North Korea to become less reclusive than Kim Jong Il’s regime, compared with 42 percent expecting no change,
Gallup Korea said in a report today. South Korea should provide
financial aid to the communist nation if it gives up its
nuclear-weapons program, according to 62 percent of respondents.  The survey is among the first conducted on South Korean
perceptions about North Korea’s new leadership since Kim Jong Il
died. Officials from  South Korea , the U.S.,  China ,  Japan  and
Russia are seeking to assess the geopolitical risks of the power
transition in the nuclear-armed regime.  Other results of the survey include: 61 percent oppose
immediate reunification with the North, 81 percent disapprove of
the North’s hereditary leadership succession and 71 percent said
North Korean footage showing citizens mourning for Kim didn’t
seem genuine.  The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2
percentage points, according to Gallup Korea, part of the Gallup
International Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
