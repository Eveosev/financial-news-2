Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the online and mail-
order video service predicting losses for next year, cut the
annual stock-option allowance for Chief Executive Officer  Reed Hastings  by half to $1.5 million.  Hastings will receive a salary of $500,000 for 2012,
unchanged from this year, according to a regulatory filing
today. His annual stock option allowance for 2011 was $3
million, according to a filing a year ago.  Netflix shares have dropped 75 percent from their all-time
closing high of $298.73 set on July 13 as the company battled a
subscriber revolt over price increases and other changes to its
mail-order and streaming services. In October, Netflix projected
losses in 2012 as it expands to the U.K.  Annual pay for Leslie Kilgore, chief marketing officer,
will be cut to $575,000 from $802,000 in 2011, according to the
filings. Kilgore’s option grant was increased to $1.33 million
from $1.1 million. The 2012 salary for Neil Hunt, chief product
officer, will be unchanged at $1 million and the option
allowance will increase to $1.5 million from $900,000.  “We don’t comment on board decisions or executive
compensation,” said  Steve Swasey , a Netflix spokesman.  Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, rose 4 percent to
$73.84 at the close in  New York . The shares have lost 58 percent
this year.  Ted Sarandos, chief content officer, will receive $1
million in salary and $1.8 million in option allowances,
compared with $903,362 and $1.4 million, respectively, last
year, according to the filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
