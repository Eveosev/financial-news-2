Oil gained for a fourth day in  New
York  after U.S. crude inventories declined the most in a decade,
signaling tighter supplies in the world’s biggest consumer of
the commodity.  Futures rose as much as 0.7 percent after gaining 1.5
percent yesterday as Energy Department data showed stockpiles
fell 10.6 million barrels, the largest decrease by volume since
February 2001. New York oil will average a record $100 a barrel
next year as the U.S. avoids recession, while London-traded
Brent will decline from the 2011 mean, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of analysts.  “It was a very large drawdown,” said  Jonathan Barratt , a
managing director at Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney
who predicts New York oil may climb as high as $103.40 before
the end of the year. The drop in stockpiles “is lending support
to the fact that the market is expecting the recovery to gain
momentum,” he said  Crude for February delivery climbed as much as 72 cents to
$99.39 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was $99.31 at 4:18 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday increased $1.43 to $98.67, the highest close
since Dec. 13. Prices are 8.7 percent higher this year after
climbing 15 percent in 2010.  Brent oil for February settlement was at $108.20 a barrel,
up 0.5 percent, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The European benchmark contract’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate futures was at $8.89, compared with $9.04 yesterday
and a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Record Oil  West Texas Intermediate oil will reach an average of $100 a
barrel in 2012, based on the median of 27 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, topping the all-time high of $99.75 set
in 2008. The benchmark grade is on course to average $95 a
barrel this year. Brent will average $109, compared with $110.98
so far this year, a survey of 28 analysts showed.  U.S. crude stockpiles were forecast to decrease 2.13
million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg News  survey .
They shrank as refiners cut holdings and reduced imports before
Jan. 1, when Texas and  Louisiana  assess taxes based on the fair-
market value of inventories. Overseas purchases dropped to 7.58
million barrels a day, the lowest since September 2008,
according to the Energy Department report.  Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
West Texas Intermediate futures, slid 990,000 barrels to 30.2
million, the report showed.  Quarterly Gain  Oil is up 25 percent this quarter, the biggest gain since
the second quarter of 2009, as the European Union and the U.S.
seek support from the  Middle East  and  Asia  for sanctions against
Iran, the second-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  EU nations, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific allies discussed
possible measures in  Rome  on Dec. 20 and vowed to increase
pressure on  Iran  to abandon a suspected nuclear weapons program,
according to an Italian Foreign Ministry statement.  The U.S. sent high-ranking officials to  Saudi Arabia  and
 Israel  to discuss targeting Iran’s energy exports and is
developing plans to implement sanctions on its central bank that
complicate international purchases of crude. It is also urging
 Japan , the second-biggest buyer of Iran’s oil, to reduce its
reliance on imports from the country, according to diplomats and
analysts who are in consultation with the Obama administration.  Iran pumped about 5 percent of the world’s oil last year,
according to BP Plc’s annual Statistical Review of World Energy.
It also borders the  Strait of Hormuz , the sea channel through
which about 15.5 million barrels a day, or a sixth of global
shipments, are transported, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration says on its website.  Oil may extend its rally in New York as futures approach a
“golden cross” formation on the daily technical chart,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 50-day moving
average, at $95.41 a barrel today, has pared a discount to the
200-day mean to 32 cents, the smallest since Aug. 11. Investors
typically buy contracts when a shorter-term moving average
crosses above a longer-term one.  To contact the reporter on this story:
