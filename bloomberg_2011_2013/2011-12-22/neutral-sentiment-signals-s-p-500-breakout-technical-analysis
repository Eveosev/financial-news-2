The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  is
poised for a breakout after the proportion of investors
expecting the market to stay in a range rose to a six-year high,
according to  Michael Shaoul  of Marketfield Asset Management.  The fluctuation of the benchmark index for U.S. equities,
which has been stuck in a 233-point band since Aug. 1, has
turned more investors neutral as optimism about the American
economy offset concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will slow
global growth. A weekly survey from the  American Association  of
Individual Investors, released today, showed 38 percent of the
 respondents  expected the market to be little changed over the
next six months, the highest ratio since April 2005.  “It may indicate that retail investors have finally grown
weary of responding to the market’s movements and have resigned
themselves to a range-bound market,” Shaoul, chairman of
Marketfield in New York, wrote in an e-mailed note. “Given the
tendency of extreme readings to serve as contrary indicators, we
cannot help wonder whether a surge in Neutral answers will
presage the end of this five-month trading range, with our money
being on an upside breakout if one were to occur.”  The  S&P 500  fell to this year’s intraday low of 1,074.77 on
Oct. 4 as Europe’s credit crisis spread from  Greece  to Italy and
Spain. The index then posted the biggest monthly rally since
1991 as European leaders agreed to expand a bailout fund and
reports showed U.S. economic growth accelerated. The advance has
since stalled two times at the index’s 200-day average and
failed to push the gauge above an intraday high of 1,307.38 that
it reached on Aug. 1.  AAII’s survey showed 28 percent of respondents were
pessimistic while bulls accounted for 34 percent. Investors who
expected the market to be flat jumped from 26 percent last week,
for the biggest increase since November 2010, according to data
compiled from Bloomberg.  Wall Street strategists forecast the benchmark index to end
this year at 1,278, according to the average of 12 estimates in
a Bloomberg survey. The gauge gained 0.5 percent to 1,250.01 as
of 11:19 a.m.  New York  time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
