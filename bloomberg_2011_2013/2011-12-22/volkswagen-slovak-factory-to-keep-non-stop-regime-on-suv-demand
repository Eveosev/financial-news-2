Volkswagen AG (VOW) â€™s Slovak factory will
extend non-stop production until the end of June on rising
demand for sport-utility vehicles, spokesman Vladimir Machalik
said.  Round-the-clock output at the factory in Bratislava started
in September 2010 and was scheduled to end this year, Machalik
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Bratislava factory assembles Volkswagen Touareg and
Audi-brand Q7 sport-utility vehicles as well as bodies for
Porsche Cayennes. The unit produced 144,500 cars last year and
plans to ship more than 400,000 vehicles in 2012 after the
beginning of serial production of the so-called New Small Family
subcompact cars earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
