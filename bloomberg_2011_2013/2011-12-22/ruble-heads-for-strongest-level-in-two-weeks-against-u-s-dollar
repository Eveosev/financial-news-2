The ruble gained for a third day
against the dollar and surged to its strongest close against the
euro since August as oil rose.  The Russian currency rose 1.1 percent to 31.36 at the close
in Moscow against the dollar. The ruble added 1.1 percent to
40.94 versus the European common currency, the strongest level
since August 5. That put it at 35.671 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  Oil futures were 0.9 percent higher at $99.59 a barrel
after adding 1.5 percent yesterday as U.S. Energy Department
data showed stockpiles fell the most in a decade. Brent oil for
February settlement on the London-based ICE Futures Europe was
at $108.11 a barrel, up 40 cents.  Investors pared bets the Russian currency will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
31.7982 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 32.1559 per dollar yesterday. The contracts are a guide to
expectations of currency movements as they allow foreign
investors and companies to fix the  exchange rate  at a particular
level in the future.  Russia’s dollar-denominated Eurobond due in 2020 rose,
pushing the yield four basis points lower to 4.591 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
