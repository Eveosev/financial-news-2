U.K. two-year gilts rose, snapping a
three-day decline, after a report showed the U.K. economic
recovery is struggling to gain momentum.  Ten-year gilt  yields  were within five basis points of a
record low after the  Office for National Statistics  said  gross
domestic product  expanded 0.6 percent in the third quarter,
revising up a Nov. 24 estimate of 0.5 percent. Yesterday’s
minutes of the  Bank of England ’s most recent meeting showed some
policy makers said an increase in bond purchases, or
quantitative easing, may be needed. The pound was little changed
versus the dollar and euro.  “It is only a marginal upward revision,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The continued weakness of the U.K. economy
will keep alive market hopes of further QE in 2012.”  The two-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 0.34 percent at 4:44 p.m. London time. The
2.25 percent security due March 2014 gained 0.07, or 70 pence
per 1,000-pound ($1,567) face amount, to 104.185.  Ten-year yields were one basis point lower at 2.06 percent
after yesterday declining to 2.016 percent, the least on record.  Gilts have returned almost 16 percent this year, including
reinvested interest, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German  government bonds  have gained 9 percent and  U.S.
Treasuries  have returned 9.5 percent, the indexes show.  Pound Little Changed  The pound was little changed against the dollar at $1.5672.
It was also little changed at 83.24 pence per euro, after
yesterday strengthening to as much as 83.03 pence, the strongest
level since Jan. 13.  Sterling has advanced 0.9 percent in 2011 against nine
developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The dollar is 1 percent stronger and the euro has lost
1.5 percent, the indexes show.  The Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor  Mervyn King 
voted unanimously to keep the target for gilt buying at 275
billion pounds after increasing it by 75 billion pounds in
October, according to the minutes of their Dec. 7-8 meeting
published yesterday.  British  house prices  will “edge lower” next year as a
supply shortage helps to limit the impact of weak economic
growth, the  Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors said today.  Prices will be about 3 percent lower at the end of 2012
than in the fourth quarter of this year, the London-based group
said in a report.  Total  business investment  rose 0.3 percent in the third
quarter, the statistics office said in a separate announcement,
beating the forecast of a 1.4 percent drop, the median estimate
of 4 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
