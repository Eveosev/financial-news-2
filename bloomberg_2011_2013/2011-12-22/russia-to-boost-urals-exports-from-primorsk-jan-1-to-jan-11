Russia , the worldâ€™s largest oil
producer, will export 22 cargoes of Urals crude from its Baltic
Sea port of Primorsk from Jan. 1 to Jan. 11, four more than a
month earlier, according to a partial loading schedule obtained
by Bloomberg News.  Shipments will total 2.2 million metric tons, or 16 million
barrels, the plan showed. The full schedule for January will be
released later this month.  Russia will ship two 60,000 ton-cargoes of Siberian Light
crude from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  on Jan. 1 to Jan. 11,
according to the plan.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
