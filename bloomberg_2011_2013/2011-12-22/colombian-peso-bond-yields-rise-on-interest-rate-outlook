Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields up the most in 12 weeks, on speculation higher-than-
forecast growth in the third quarter will lead the central bank
to raise  interest rates  further.  The yield on the nation’s 9.25 percent bonds due in May
2014 rose 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 6.23
percent, according to the stock exchange. That’s the biggest
increase since Oct. 3. The bond’s price fell 0.262 centavo to
106.457 centavos per peso.  Colombia’s economy expanded 7.7 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace since the fourth
quarter of 2006, the national statistics agency said today in
Bogota. The growth exceeded the estimates of all 30 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median forecast was for an increase
of 6 percent.  “Growth was impressive,” said Daniel Escobar, an analyst
at brokerage Global Securities in Bogota. “The central bank
will need to raise rates to keep inflation under control.”  The gap between yields on government inflation-indexed
bonds due 2015 and similar-maturity fixed-rate debt, a gauge of
annual consumer price increase expectations, rose to 3.88
percentage points today, from 3.54 two months ago.  Annual inflation quickened to 4.02 percent in October,
breaching the central bank’s target range for the first time
since 2009, before slowing to 3.96 percent in November. Banco de
la Republica targets inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent
this year and next.  Foreign Investment  Policy makers in November raised the  key rate  a quarter
percentage point to 4.75 percent, citing the need to bolster the
central bank’s credibility after “strong” growth drove up
inflation expectations, according to minutes of the meeting. The
central bank left the rate unchanged in the Dec. 16 meeting.  Banco de la Republica “will resume the tightening cycle
sooner rather than later” in the first quarter, Barclays
Capital Inc. Latin America analysts Alejandro Arreaza and
 Alejandro Grisanti  wrote in a report today.  “Domestic factors, particularly the dynamism of the
economy and the potential pressures in prices that it could
imply, are expected to offset the uncertainty coming from the
European sovereign debt crisis and the slowdown of the global
economy,” they wrote.  Gross domestic product rose a revised 5.1 percent in the
second quarter, the national statistics agency said in today’s
report. Construction and mining activity each jumped more than
18 percent in the July-September period from a year ago, today’s
report showed.  Guerrilla Groups  A military offensive against guerrilla groups has increased
security in the past decade in the Andean nation, opening up
vast swathes of the countryside for companies to explore for
oil, coal and gold. Foreign direct investment may reach a record
$12 billion this year, up from $9.5 billion in 2010, central
bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said Nov. 11.  Alberto Ramos , a Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs,
raised his forecast for Colombia growth this year to 5.7
percent, up from a previous 5.3 percent, following the GDP
number. Growth should ease next year to about 4 percent before
accelerating to 5.1 percent in 2013, Ramos wrote.  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 1,923.30 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,931.88 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
