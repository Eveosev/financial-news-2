OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil
producer, plans to boost investment about 35 percent to a record
next year while production growth slows.  Capital expenditures  are budgeted at 480 billion rubles
($15 billion) as the company upgrades refineries, Moscow-based
Rosneft said today on its website. The state-controlled company
targeted spending of about $11 billion this year, according to
its third-quarter financial presentation.  Rosneft’s output growth is slowing as western Siberian
fields mature, diluting the gains at its Vankor field in
Russia’s east. Rosneft’s crude production has overtaken Exxon
Mobil Corp.’s as the highest among publicly traded companies,
Vedomosti reported today.  Production will climb to 124 million metric tons of liquids
next year (2.48 million barrels a day) from 122.5 million tons
this year, according to the statement. On a per-day basis, that
is growth of about 1 percent, according to Bloomberg
calculations. Crude and gas condensate output rose by 2.5
percent this year, according to the statement.  Crude processing at Rosneft’s refineries will probably
reach 64.6 million tons next year from 57.9 million tons this
year, according to the statement. The company is devoting 168
billion rubles, or about 35 percent of the planned spending, to
modernizing refineries and improving fuel quality.  “The goal of the program is by 2015 to produce Euro-5
motor fuel by 2015,” Rosneft said. Euro-5 grade contains no
more than 10 parts per million of sulfur.  To contact the reporter on this story:
