Iran ’s gasoline production will rise
by 18 million liters, or about 118,000 barrels a day next year,
state TV reported, citing Alireza Zeighami, managing director of
the National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Co.  The increase in output is expected after the completion of
development projects at seven refineries, Zeighami said,
according to a report on the Iranian TV’s  website .  Iran’s current gasoline output is about 60 million liters a
day, while domestic consumption is some 59 million liters of
gasoline a day, the report said.  Iran is facing obstacles in developing its energy resources
due to international sanctions over its nuclear program, which
the U.S. and its allies said is a cover for developing atomic
weapons. Iran rejects the accusation and says its program is
civilian.  The Persian Gulf country, the second-largest oil producer
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, says it
has reached self-sufficiency in gasoline production. Iranian
officials attribute this to a decrease in consumption following
the phasing out of energy subsidies, a scheme started in
December 2010.  Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said yesterday that
his country aims to become a “major” gasoline exporter by
2013, according to a report by the state-run Fars news agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
