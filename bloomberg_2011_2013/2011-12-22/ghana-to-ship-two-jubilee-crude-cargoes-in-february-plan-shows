Ghana will ship two cargoes of
Jubilee crude in February, unchanged from January, according to
a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The shipments are 950,000 barrels each, the plan showed.  The Jubilee field is operated by U.K.-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) 
and started production in December 2010.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
