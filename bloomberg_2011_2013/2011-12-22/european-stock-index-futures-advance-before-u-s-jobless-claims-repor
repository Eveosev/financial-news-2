European  stocks advanced, extending
this week’s gains, after U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly fell
last week to the lowest since April 2008, indicating the
recovery in the world’s largest economy is on track.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA and  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  climbed after the parent of British Airways reached
a binding agreement to buy Lufthansa’s BMI unit.  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK)  and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA jumped more than 3 percent, as banks pared
some of this year’s slump.  Stagecoach Group Plc (SGC)  slid 3.4 percent
after JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised selling the shares.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  added 1.1 percent to 239.78 at
the close in London, bringing this week’s gains to 2.6 percent.
The benchmark measure has rallied 12 percent from this year’s
low on Sept. 22 amid optimism that U.S. economic growth is
holding firm and euro-area leaders are moving to stem the
region’s debt crisis.  “We’ve seen encouraging economic news out of the U.S.,”
said Robert Talbut, who helps oversee about $70 billion as chief
investment officer at Royal  London  Asset Management Ltd. “I
still believe that the necessary shifts will occur in Europe and
that in combination with more supportive moves elsewhere, 2012
can turn out to be a decent year for credit and equities.”  The Stoxx 600 index has still tumbled 13 percent this year
as the crisis spread to Italy and  Spain . Banks and commodity
companies have posted the largest declines among 19 industry
groups on the gauge, both slumping more than 30 percent.  U.S. Unemployment  U.S.  jobless claims  unexpectedly dropped last week to the
lowest since April 2008, a sign that the U.S. labor market is
strengthening. Jobless claims fell by 4,000 to 364,000 in the
week ended Dec. 17, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 45 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected an increase to 380,000.  Another report showed American  consumer confidence  rose
more than forecast in December, to a six-month high. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment
climbed to 69.9 from 64.1 at the end of November. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called for 68 after a
preliminary reading of 67.7.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 15 of the 18 western-
 European (SXXP)  stock markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index rose 1.3
percent,  Germany ’s DAX advanced 1.1 percent and  France ’s CAC 40
gained 1.4 percent.  U.K. GDP Growth  In the U.K., economic growth accelerated more than
previously estimated in the third quarter in an increase that
the  Bank of England  says is unlikely to be repeated as the euro-
area debt crisis curbs bank lending and dents confidence. Gross
domestic product rose 0.6 percent from the previous quarter,
faster than the 0.5 percent previously estimated, the Office for
National Statistics said today in London.  In the euro area, the rescue fund’s lending capacity would
fall by around a third to 293 billion euros ($382 billion) if
France’s top credit rating were cut and governments tried to
retain the facility’s AAA grade without adding credit
enhancements,  Trevor Cullinan  of  Standard & Poor’s  said.  The European Financial Stability Facility’s firepower of
440 billion euros stems from government guarantees that total
almost twice the figure, giving the 17-nation fund a AAA rating
that limits the cost of selling debt to finance emergency loans.
France, one of six EFSF backers with the top grade, had its
credit outlook lowered by  Fitch Ratings  last week.  The volume of shares changing hands across  Europe  has
fallen this week as the Christmas holiday break approaches.
Trading on the Stoxx 600 this week was 83 percent of the average
for 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  IAG’s BMI Deal  IAG advanced 3.3 percent to 149.9 pence after agreeing to
buy Lufthansa’s BMI unit in the U.K. for 172.5 million pounds
($270.5 million), fending off a counterbid from Virgin Atlantic
Airways Ltd. IAG said the acquisition will boost its operating
profit by 100 million euros in 2015. Lufthansa added 1.9 percent
to 9.20 euros.  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender, rose 3.2 percent
to 29.29 euros. BNP Paribas, France’s biggest, added 3.4 percent
to 30.24 euros. A gauge of banks was the best performer among
the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600, gaining 2 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company,
increased 1.9 percent to 1,870 pence as copper climbed on the
London Metal Exchange.  Oil Companies Advance  A gauge of oil and gas companies rose 1.7 percent as crude
oil posted a fourth day of gains. TGS Nopec Geophysical Co. ASA
rallied 4.6 percent to 133 kroner. BP Plc advanced 2.5 percent
to 450.3 pence.  RWE AG (RWE)  gained 4.9 percent to 27.52 euros. The German city
of Wiesbaden may buy a stake in Suewag Energie AG if RWE sells
its holding in the energy company,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported today, citing city officials.  Perform Group Plc rallied 5 percent to 210 pence after
winning a four-year deal with the Women’s Tennis Association to
manage all media rights from the beginning of 2013.  Stagecoach, the operator of Britain’s biggest rail-commuter
franchise, retreated 3.4 percent to 260.9 pence after the shares
were downgraded to “underweight” from “overweight” at
JPMorgan by equity analyst David Pitura, who set the six-month
target price at 280 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
