Argentina ’s Senate approved today
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s budget bill for 2012
that includes a plan to use $5.7 billion in central bank
reserves to pay debt.  Senators voted 44 to 26 in favor of the initiative.
According to the bill, which was approved last week by the lower
house of Congress,  South America ’s second-biggest economy will
grow 5.1 percent next year, while the  trade surplus  will narrow
to $8.6 billion from $9 billion in 2011.  Next year’s primary surplus, which excludes interest
payments, will be 2.5 percent of gross domestic product while
the overall surplus will be 0.2 percent of GDP, the bill said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
