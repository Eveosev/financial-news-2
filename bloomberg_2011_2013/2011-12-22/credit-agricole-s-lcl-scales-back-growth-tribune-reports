LCL, the retail bank that used to be
called Credit Lyonnais and is now owned by Credit Agricole SA,
has scaled back its development plans because of the slowing
economy, La Tribune reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The bank now aims to win 550,000 new accounts over the
three years to 2013, down from the original target of 630,000,
and has cut the number of planned branch openings to 45 from 90.
As a result, after hiring 290 people in 2011, the bank plans to
hold employment steady for the next two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
