Polish  retail-sales  growth
unexpectedly accelerated in November as the European Union’s
largest eastern economy weathers the escalating debt crisis and
companies continue to hire, bolstering  consumer confidence .  Sales  rose 12.6 percent from a year earlier after rising
11.2 percent in October, the  Central Statistical Office  in
Warsaw said today. The figure compares with a 10.5 percent
median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. November
sales dropped 5.5 percent on the month.  While the weak zloty is spurring inflation, boosting the
nominal value of retail sales, it also helps exports to keep
economic growth strong even as output slows in the euro region,
the country’s main trading partner. Local companies increased
employment by 2.5 percent in November from the previous year.  “The increasing prices of food and fuel in connection with
the weak zloty are probably the main reasons why annual retail-
sales growth is remaining stable,” Jaroslaw Janecki, chief
economist at  Societe Generale  in Warsaw, said in an e-mailed
comment ahead of the data release. “Moreover, higher-than-
expected annual industrial-output growth usually indicates a
more robust increase in retail sales.”  Poland’s unemployment rate jumped to 12.1 percent in
November from 11.8 percent the previous month, the statistics
office said today in a separate report, in line with the median
forecast of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
