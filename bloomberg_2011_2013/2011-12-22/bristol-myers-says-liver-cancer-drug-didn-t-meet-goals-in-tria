Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  said its
experimental brivanib drug for  liver cancer  didn’t improve
patient survival better than a placebo.  The study, one of four final-stage clinical trials
evaluating brivanib in liver cancer, tested the experimental
drug in patients who failed on or were intolerant to Nexavar,
the liver cancer drug from  Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.  and Bayer
AG, Bristol said today in a statement. New York-based Bristol
will continue with the other trials, it said.  “We remain committed to the development of brivanib as a
potential treatment option for patients with liver cancer,”
said Brian Daniels, a Bristol senior vice president, in  the
statement . A study testing the drug as an initial treatment for
liver cancer is expected to finish in 2012, the company said.  The failure “won’t matter much” as sales expectations for
brivanib are not high,  Mark Schoenebaum , an analyst at ISI
Group, said in a research note. The most notable use for the
drug is as an initial treatment, he said. The trial for that
treatment is comparing the Bristol drug with  Nexavar .  The failure of the drug to work in this study “reduces,
but does not entirely rule out” the chances that brivanib will
work as a first treatment, Schoenebaum wrote. Brivanib could
have sales of $150 million in 2020, he said.  In its statement, Bristol said it would present detailed
results of the failed study at a future scientific meeting.  Editors: Chris Staiti, Stephen West  To contact the reporter on this story:
