Fourth-quarter earnings reports by
U.S. companies will be weaker than those in recent periods as
emerging markets slow and  Europe ’s economy struggles, according
to Thomas Doerflinger, a strategist at UBS AG.  Early earnings reports from 23 companies for the period
have been “mediocre,” with 26 percent missing analyst
estimates, compared with an average 15 percent over the past
three quarters, Doerflinger said in a note dated yesterday.
 Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s second-quarter report on Dec. 20, which showed it
missed analyst predictions for both profit and revenue, “is
ominous evidence of weaker macro trends,” Doerflinger said,
citing  Brent Thill , a UBS analyst.  “The overall profit picture is deteriorating,”
Doerflinger wrote. “We expect this trend to continue as
emerging markets slow and Europe’s recession deepens.”  U.S. companies have beaten analyst profit estimates for 11
straight quarters as the country climbed out of the worst
recession since the Great Depression. The euro zone’s gross
domestic product won’t change in 2012 after expanding 1.6
percent growth in 2011, according to the median of economist
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. The  International Monetary Fund 
cut its 2012 forecast in September for the expansion in  emerging
markets  to 6.1 percent from 6.4 percent.  Doerflinger estimates that companies in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index will earn $99 a share next year, the lowest
among 12 strategist forecasts tracked by Bloomberg. The average
prediction is $102.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
