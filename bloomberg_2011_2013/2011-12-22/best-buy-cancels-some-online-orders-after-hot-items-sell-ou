Best Buy Co. (BBY) , the world’s largest
consumer-electronics retailer, canceled some customers’ online
orders after it ran out of popular merchandise.  “Overwhelming demand of hot product offerings” on
BestBuy.com led to the cancellations, Lisa Hawks, a spokeswoman
for the Richfield, Minnesota-based retailer, said today in an e-
mail. She declined to disclose the number of orders that won’t
be filled or identify the items.  The canceled orders covered the weekend after Thanksgiving,
when Best Buy stepped up discounts against  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  Best Buy promoted “aggressively online,”
leading to higher traffic and an increase in sales by stores
open at least 14 months, Chief Executive Officer Brian Dunn told
analysts on Dec. 13.  “I presume it’s not particularly material, but the bad
press is enough to scare some people away from ordering online
at Best Buy in the future, so it’s not positive,”  Michael Pachter , an analyst at Wedbush Securities in  Los Angeles , said
today by e-mail. He rates the shares “neutral.”  Online revenue in the U.S. climbed 20 percent in the third
quarter ended Nov. 26, outpacing overall domestic comparable-
store sales growth of 0.9 percent, the company said.  Increased discounts on products such as flat-panel
televisions and mobile devices hurt profit in the third quarter,
leading to a 29 percent decline in net income.  Best Buy rose 1.5 percent to $23.22 at the close in New
York. The shares have tumbled 32 percent this year.  The Associated Press reported earlier on the cancellations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
