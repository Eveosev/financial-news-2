Arizona Chemical Ltd, a producer and
refiner of pine chemicals, obtained $610 million in loans that
were partially used to pay a $290 million dividend to owners led
by private-equity firm American Securities LLC, according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  arranged the financing for the
Jacksonville, Florida-based company which consisted of a $550
million term loan and a $60 million revolving line of credit,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds from the
transaction were also used to refinance debt.  The dividend provides a return of 90 percent on American
Securities investment in the company, said the person, who
declined to be identified becuase the terms are private.  Rhone Capital LLC sold a majority interest in Arizona
Chemical to American Securities in September 2010, Bloomberg
data show. Rhone, along with other investors and the management
team retained 25 percent ownership in the company, according to
a Sept.  statement .  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a  term loan , it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
