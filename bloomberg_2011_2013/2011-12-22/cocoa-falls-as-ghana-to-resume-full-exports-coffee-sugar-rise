Cocoa fell for the first time in
three days on signs that a disagreement over port fees that
hampered exports is close to being resolved in  Ghana , the
world’s second-biggest grower. Coffee and sugar rose.  Shipments will probably be at “full capacity” tomorrow,
Transport Minister Alhaji Collins Dauda said by telephone today.
Cocoa deliveries have been disrupted for at least two weeks at
Safmarine Container Lines NV and A.P. Moller-Maersk S/A because
of the disagreement.  “The dispute has been slowing shipping and providing
support, and the market is giving back some of those the gains
now,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president with Price Futures Group
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Cocoa for March delivery fell 1 percent to settle at $2,221
a metric ton at noon on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Prices
have dropped 27 percent this year.  Ghana’s shipments fell to an average of 33,000 tons a month
since the season started in October, compared with a rate of
90,000 tons last harvest, Tony Fofie, the chief executive
officer of the country’s cocoa board, said yesterday.  Ivory
Coast  is the biggest grower.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery gained 0.7
percent to $2.214 a pound in New York, the third gain in four
days. The commodity has dropped 7.9 percent in 2011.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to
23.44 cents a pound on ICE. The sweetener has fallen 27 percent
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
