John Duffield , founder of  New Star
Asset Management Holdings Inc. , denied claims made by a former
 fund manager  that he bullied his staff.  Patrick Evershed made “extreme and colorful statements”
at an employment tribunal hearing in a dispute that was
subsequently settled this month, Duffield said in comments on a
 website . The case was settled before New Star could fully refute
them in court, he said.  “Patrick made a number of statements that were exposed as
misleading during cross-examination or were refuted under oath
by New Star’s witnesses before he truncated the hearing,”
Duffield said on his website.  Evershed sued New Star for unfair dismissal after being
suspended in 2008 by the fund’s chief executive officer, Howard Covington. The suspension came shortly after Evershed wrote a
letter to New Star’s human resources department complaining
about Duffield’s conduct.  “I’d love to give a detailed response to some of the
points, but I can’t,” Evershed said of Duffield’s comments in a
telephone interview today.  New Star was bought by  London  Stock Exchange-listed
 Henderson Group Plc (HGG)  in 2009 for about 107 million pounds ($167.8
million) in cash and stock.  Evershed and New Star “reached an agreement which resolves
the employment tribunal proceedings without admission of
liability,” Henderson Group said in an e-mailed statement.
“Both parties are satisfied with the terms of the agreement,
and have agreed to keep them confidential.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
