Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , a
Chinese solar module maker, denied a report by Handelsblatt that
it’s in talks with  Conergy AG  over a partnership.  “I haven’t heard of the discussions and any intentions for
the partnership,” Miao Qing, Yingli’s director of  investor
relations , said today by phone.  Handelsblatt reported today that Conergy is in talks with
Chinese rivals including Yingli and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  over a
partnership that may result in an investment, citing Conergy’s
board member Alexander Gorski.  Two calls to the Shanghai and San Jose-based offices of
Thomas Young, Trina’s senior director of investor relations,
weren’t answered during the regular Chinese business day and
after regular work hours in  California . An e-mail to the
company’s public relations agency Brunswick Group in Beijing
wasn’t answered.  Conergy, once  Germany ’s largest solar company and which was
taken over by creditors in July, last month posted a third-
quarter loss bigger than its market value as prices and demand
fell at home. The company said in September that it will cut 100
jobs, halt production of wafers and cells and focus on the end-
product modules.  Robert Bosch GmbH  said yesterday that it bought Conergy’s
Voltwerk Electronics GmbH unit to enter the market for solar
inverters, devices that connect electricity generated by panels
to the transmission grid.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
