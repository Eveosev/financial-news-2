Mercator Poslovni Sistem d.d. (MELR) , the
Slovenian store chain, dropped to the lowest level in 15 months
after its largest owners postponed a decision to sell a stake in
the company to Croatian rival Agrokor d.d.  The stock, which has lost more than 15 percent in two days,
declined 12 euros, or 7.9 percent, to close at 140 euros, the
lowest level since September last year. That gives the
Ljubljana-based company a market value of 527 million euros
($687 million).  “Shares may plunge further to the 130-euro-level, unless
there is some positive news on the takeover bid by Agrokor,”
Radivoj Pregelj, an analyst at Abanka Vipa d.d., said in a phone
interview.  Owners of Mercator, including the two largest shareholders
 Pivovarna Lasko d.d. (PILR)  and Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., postponed
the decision to sell the majority of the biggest supermarket
chain in the Balkans to Agrokor as opposition to the sale
intensified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
