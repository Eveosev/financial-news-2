Posco (005490) , the world’s third-biggest
steelmaker, denied a MoneyToday report it is seeking to acquire
Australia’s  OneSteel Ltd. (OST)   Posco internally reviewed a possible acquisition of
OneSteel, and decided not to pursue the deal, Jeong Jin Suk, a
Posco spokeswoman, said by phone today. Steve Ashe, a spokesman
for OneSteel, said the company doesn’t comment on speculation.  Posco has hired Bank of America Corp. and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc as advisers, Korean Internet news provider
MoneyToday said. The deal may be worth between 2 trillion won
($1.7 billion) and 4 trillion won, the report said.  OneSteel, Australia’s second-largest producer of steel, has
a market value of A$1 billion. AXA SA holds 8.35 percent of the
company and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. owns 5
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
