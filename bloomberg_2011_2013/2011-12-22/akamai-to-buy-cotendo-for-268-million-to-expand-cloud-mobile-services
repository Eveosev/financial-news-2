Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) , whose
server network lets businesses speed data delivery, agreed to
buy Cotendo for about $268 million in cash to expand Internet-
based and mobile services.  Cotendo, founded in 2008 and based in Sunnyvale,
 California , has about 100 employees, half of them in Israel,
where the company has a technology center, according to a
statement today.  The purchase is Akamai’s second largest after the $2.19
billion acquisition of InterVU Inc. in 2000, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Cotendo will bring acceleration
technologies based on the so-called cloud, a Web-based computing
system, used by customers such as phone companies and social
networks.  Cotendo’s investors include venture-capital firms Sequoia
Capital and Benchmark Capital, as well as Juniper Networks Inc.,
according to its  website .  Akamai, based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , rose 1.2 percent
to $27 at 8:03 a.m. New York time before the opening of the
markets. The company, with a market capitalization of $4.79
billion and about 2,300 employees, had slumped 43 percent this
year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
