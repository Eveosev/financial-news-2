Kenya ’s trade deficit widened in
October as import costs rose for fuel, food and manufactured
goods, the East African nation’s statistics office said.  The gap increased 40 percent to 70.4 billion shillings
($841.8 million) from a year earlier, the Nairobi-based  Kenya
National Bureau of Statistics  said on its website today. Imports
advanced to 115.7 billion shillings in October, from 82.7
billion shillings, while exports grew to 45.3 billion shillings,
from 32.3 billion shillings, the bureau said.  Uganda was the biggest buyer of Kenyan products, while
 United Arab Emirates  was the main source of imports, it said.  Kenya, the world’s largest grower of black tea, exported
29,421.7 metric tons of tea in October, up 19 percent from a
year earlier, which fetched 8.8 billion shillings. Sales of
coffee rose 11 percent to 3,298 metric tons, the statistic
office said.  Kenya’s shilling lost about quarter of its value against
the dollar between January and Oct. 11 when it hit a record low
of 106.75, increasing the cost of imports paid for in dollars.
The currency has since pared losses, and was trading at 83.65
per dollar by 5:12 p.m. in Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
