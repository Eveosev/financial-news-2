Asian stocks dropped, snapping a
two-day rally, as European lenders sought record loans from the
central bank and U.S. home sales missed forecasts, damping the
earnings outlook for exporters.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., dropped 2.9 percent in  Hong Kong .  Tokio Marine
Holdings Inc. (8766)  slid 1.7 percent on concern the insurer may be
paying too much for a $2.7 billion acquisition.  OneSteel Ltd. (OST) 
jumped 10 percent in Sydney after saying it’s not considering a
debt or share sale.  “The ECB doesn’t seem to have stepped up to the plate for
bond buying, which I think is negative,” said  Shane Oliver ,
Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which manages about $100 billion. “At least
they are acting as a lender of last resort for banks.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.3 percent to 112.84 as
of 8 p.m. in  Tokyo , with about five shares falling for every
four that rose. The gauge slid to a three-week low on Dec. 19
after North Korean leader Kim Jong Il died and Fitch Ratings
said it may cut credit ratings of European nations. Trading
volume was below the 30-day average in all of Asia’s major
markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.8 percent before a
public holiday tomorrow. South Korea’s Kospi Index lost 0.1
percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 declined 1.2 percent and Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.2 percent.  China ’s Shanghai
Composite Index dropped 0.2 percent, paring losses of as much as
1.9 percent.  Default Risks  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.6 percent
today after the gauge added 0.2 percent yesterday, lifted by
gains in energy and consumer shares. U.S. equities fell earlier
after the ECB offered 489 billion euros ($645 billion) in 1,134-
day loans to banks, the most ever in a single operation and more
than economists’ estimates.  The increased funding sought by lenders may indicate
institutions are wary of lending to each other amid a heightened
risk of government and bank defaults.  Exporters to the U.S. declined after sales of existing
homes in the world’s biggest economy missed economists’
estimates. A report by the National Association of Realtors
revised down the number of existing home sales in the U.S. by an
average of 14 percent since 2007, indicating the depth of the
slump that contributed to the last recession.  Li & Fung dropped 2.9 percent to HK$14.14 in Hong Kong.
Nissan Motor Co., which depends on North America for a third of
its sales, lost 0.9 percent to 692 yen in Tokyo.  Toshiba Corp. (6502) ,
a maker of home appliances, medical equipment and power plants,
fell 1 percent to 309 yen.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , the world’s biggest maker of memory-chip
testers, sank 4.5 percent to 740 yen, the lowest since November
1992. JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its rating to “underweight”
from “neutral,” citing weak orders.  ‘Negative Impact’  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped 18 percent this year
through yesterday, heading for its worst performance since 2008.
Utilities posted the biggest decline among the 10 industry
groups in the gauge as Japanese utilities tumbled after
meltdowns at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant. It was the worst nuclear accident in 25 years.  The regional benchmark index’s drop this year compared with
a 1.1 percent decline by the S&P 500 and a 14 percent slide by
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Stocks (MXAP)  in the Asian gauge were
valued at 12.7 times estimated earnings on average, compared
with 12.6 times for the S&P 500 and 10.3 times for the Stoxx
600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tokio Marine dropped 1.7 percent to 1,713 yen after it
agreed to buy Delphi Financial Group Inc. for $2.7 billion in
cash. acquisition comes amid waning demand in Japan, where the
population is declining.  “The premium paid in this acquisition may have a negative
impact on the company’s shares in the short term,” Wataru Otsuka, an analyst at Nomura Securities Co. said in a report.  Kathmandu Plunges  Kathmandu Holdings Ltd. (KMD)  plunged 25 percent to NZ$1.64 after
the supplier of travel equipment said trading during the
Christmas period hasn’t met expectations. The company said
first-half earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization may drop from NZ$23.2 million ($17.8 million) a
year ago.  Among stocks that advanced, OneSteel jumped 10 percent to
75 Australian cents, the most on the MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index.
The company said it’s not considering a debt or share sale,
rejecting speculation it may need to raise capital. Deutsche
Bank AG said last month there’s a “significant risk” the
steelmaker may have to raise funds due to a likely breach of
financial covenants.  To contact the reporters on this story:
