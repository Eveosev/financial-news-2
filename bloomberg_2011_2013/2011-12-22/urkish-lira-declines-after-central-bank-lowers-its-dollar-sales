The lira weakened against the dollar
after the central bank sold $50 million in its daily auction,
down from $350 million each in the last two days.  The currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.8891 at 5:04
p.m., bringing this year’s decline to 18 percent.  Yields  on two-
year benchmark debt increased seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point to 10.46 percent, a Royal Bank of Scotland
index of the securities showed.  The Ankara-based bank sold one third of the maximum $150
million it offered in an auction today. It received $181 million
in bids compared with $511 million yesterday. The bank’s $700
million sale in the last two days followed lira’s record low
against the dollar this week.  Turkey ’s foreign-exchange reserves
fell to $82.7 billion on Dec. 16, down from $84.4 billion in the
previous week, weekly data from the bank showed today.  “The central bank’s reserves are limited and therefore it
avoids making very hefty sales,” Tufan Comert, a strategist at
Garanti Securities in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  The central bank sold about $10.6 billion since August to
bolster the lira and contain inflation, which at 9.5 percent in
November is the highest in 19 months. It offered to sell a
maximum of $1.7 billion over Dec. 23 and Dec. 27, according to
the bank, which won’t hold an auction on Dec. 26 due to a
holiday in the U.S.  The central bank kept its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged
at 5.75 percent today for a fifth month, saying it will keep
borrowing costs elevated to restrain inflation and slow credit
growth, according to a statement on the bank’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
