Sion Power Corp. , a closely held
maker of rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries, received a $50
million equity investment.  The Tucson, Arizona-based company disclosed the financing
today in a filing that listed a single investor without
providing a name. John Kopera, Sion’s director of commercial
operations, didn’t reply to messages today.  Sion makes batteries for electric vehicles and portable
power applications and is working with BASF SE and the U.S.
Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Lab to develop
car batteries with a range of more than 300 miles. That research
is being funded by a three-year, $5 million grant awarded in
April 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
