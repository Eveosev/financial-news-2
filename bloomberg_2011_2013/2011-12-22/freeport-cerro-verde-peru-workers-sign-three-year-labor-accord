Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc.’s (FCX)  Peruvian unit, which ended a 61-day strike last month,
said it signed a three-year labor accord with workers that will
enable it to move ahead with a $3.5 billion expansion.  The agreement with Freeport’s  Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde
SAA (CVERDEC1)  copper mine, which lasts through August 2014, includes a 5
percent wage rise in 2012, 4 percent annual increases over the
following two years and a 24,000 soles ($8,888) signing bonus,
union official William Camacho said today by telephone.  “We’ve achieved a temporary peace, although there are
still issues pending,” Camacho said today from Arequipa, 750
kilometers (466 miles) southeast of Lima. “This process
strengthened our union and will set a precedent for future
mining negotiations in  Peru .”  Workers in Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Indonesia held
stoppages at copper, gold and zinc mines this year to pressure
for better conditions and a bigger percentage of record profits
after metal prices surged. Workers at Freeport’s Grasberg mine
in Indonesia ended a three-month strike last week after agreeing
on a wage increase.  “We now look forward to continued safe production and
future expansion opportunities at Cerro Verde,” Freeport
spokesman  Eric Kinneberg  said today in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
