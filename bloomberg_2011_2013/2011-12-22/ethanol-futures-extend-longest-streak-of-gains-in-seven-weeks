Ethanol extended its longest streak
of gains in seven weeks on speculation that production costs
will increase.  Futures rose as corn advanced on concern that hot, dry
weather blanketing  South America  is damaging crops and will lead
to increased U.S. exports. Ethanol in the U.S. is made mostly
from the grain. The profit from turning a bushel of corn into
the biofuel is referred to as the crush margin.  “Ethanol trade continues to track corn more or less,
although today saw a small gain in the crush,” SCB & Associates
in  Chicago  wrote in a note to clients.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery added 1.6 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $2.173 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have fallen 8.6 percent this year and are
headed for the first yearly decline since 2008.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.325 a gallon and in  New York  the additive climbed 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.285 a gallon, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago added 0.5 cent to $2.205 a gallon and in
New York the biofuel increased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.285.  Corn futures for March delivery climbed 1 cent to $6.175 a
bushel on the CBOT, capping the first five-session gain since
mid-May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
