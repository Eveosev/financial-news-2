The majority of foreign-exchange
funds in an index compiled by Parker Global Strategies LLC had
negative returns in November amid heightened volatility in the
U.S. currency.  “The volatility in the dollar reflected the ongoing
weakness in the European Union, coupled with the  Federal
Reserve ’s announcement that economic growth strengthened month-
over-month and that there were no immediate plans to implement a
third round of quantitative easing,” according to a statement
from Parker Global.  The Parker FX Index, which tracks 57 programs run by 49
firms managing over $47 billion in currency, declined 0.03
percent last month. Thirty of the 53 tracked managers that
reported November results had losses, 22 reported gains and one
was unchanged. Performance in November ranged from a gain of 5.1
percent to minus 2.6 percent.  The dollar also felt competing forces as the congressional
supercommittee failed to create a plan to reduce the nation’s
debt while stronger-than-expected retail sales were reported
over the Thanksgiving holiday, it said in the statement.  The implied  volatility  of the currencies of Group of Seven
nations rose 8.7 percent last month, according to a JPMorgan
Chase & Co. index.  The greenback was the second-best performing currency in
November versus its 16 most-traded counterparts, gaining 3
percent versus the euro. It rose 0.1 percent to $1.3057 at 12:37
