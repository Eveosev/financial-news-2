Repsol YPF SA (REP)  will spend $250
million for a share in  SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD) ’s oil and natural-
gas fields in Kansas and Oklahoma to boost the Spanish company’s
reserves and production.  Repsol will pay $250 million upfront and as much as $750
million for drilling costs during the next three years, Oklahoma
City-based Sandridge said in a statement today. Repsol will
acquire two stakes totaling about 364,000 net acres in the
Mississippian formation, according to the statement.  “We compare the scope of this play to the Bakken and
believe it will be transformational for the Mid-Continent region
of the U.S.,” SandRidge Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
Tom Ward said in the statement. The Bakken shale oil field is
the largest contiguous oil deposit in the continental U.S.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Repsol wants to diversify its portfolio in countries within
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the
Madrid-based company said in a filing in today. Repsol announced
on Dec. 20 an $840 million exploration and production venture in
Russia with  Alliance Oil Co. (AOIL)  and is investing in Brazil’s
offshore  Santos Basin .  Repsol expects to drill more than 200 horizontal wells in
2012 in the Mississippian and have more than 1,000 wells by
2014, according to the filing. Its share of the site’s output
will peak at 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2019.  SandRidge rose 23 percent, its biggest one-day climb in
more than three years, to close at $8.21 in  New York . Repsol
rose 1.4 percent in Madrid to close at 23.16 euros before the
announcement.  -- With assistance from Joanna Ossinger in New York, Editors:
