Australia  & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. plans to sell another $90 million of a $300 million
loan for  Aluminum Corp of China Ltd. (2600)  to banks after funding the
majority of the facility, a person familiar with the matter
said.  About three banks are expected to buy the debt from ANZ in
January, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the details are private. Aluminum Corp. of  China , the nationâ€™s
biggest producer of the metal, is more commonly known as Chalco.  The $300 million loan was signed on Nov. 4 and fully funded
that month, with ANZ lending $200 million via a $50 million
three-year facility and a $150 million so-called bridge loan.
Natixis SA had originally agreed to jointly and equally
underwrite the $300 million loan with ANZ. The French bank
eventually committed $50 million while Bank of America Corp.
joined with $50 million, two people with direct knowledge of the
deal said on Dec. 15.  The loan includes a structure whereby more banks can join
after it has been signed. The three banks expected to join in
January are doing so under this so-called accordion structure,
the person said today.  Other banks which have already joined under that
arrangement include  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , which lent
$50 million, and China Merchants Bank Co., which gave a
commitment letter pledging $10 million, the other person
familiar with the matter said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
