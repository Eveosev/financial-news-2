Indian lenders’ bad loans may more
than double by 2013 in a “severe risk” scenario, the  Reserve
Bank  of  India  said in a report today.  Soured loans may jump to as much as 5.8 percent of total
advances within two years under such strained conditions, from
2.8 percent in September, according to the  central bank report .
The ratio is expected to climb to 3.2 percent to 3.5 percent by
March 2013 under a baseline scenario, it said.  India’s economy  last quarter grew at the slowest pace in
more than two years after the central bank raised  interest rates 
by a record to tame the fastest inflation among so-called BRIC
nations, the world’s largest emerging markets. Credit growth in
India fell to a 20-month low of 17.73 percent in November,  data 
compiled by the  Reserve Bank of India  shows.  “While markets have already factored in some rise in bad
loans, the higher projections made by the Reserve Bank will
definitely weigh on investors’ sentiment,” Sandeep Jain, a
banking analyst at IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd. in Mumbai,
said by telephone today. “A spike in bad loans will be a drag
on the banks’ profits as the provisioning requirements will move
in tandem with the asset quality.”  The  Bankex index (BANKEX) , which tracks 14 Indian banks, rose 2.3
percent at close in Mumbai trading, limiting its decline this
year to 28 percent.  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the outlook for
India’s banking system last month to “negative,” saying a
domestic economic slowdown and the surge in borrowing costs may
boost bad loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
