Residual-fuel  inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, rose
13 percent to the highest in 12 weeks, according to a unit of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen climbed 2.22 million barrels in
the week to yesterday to 19.25 million,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. Supplies
rebounded from the lowest since the week ended Oct. 12.  Middle-distillates  inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene increased 494,000 barrels, or 6.4 percent, to 8.19
million, based on the ministry’s data. That’s a three-week high.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate fell 989,000 barrels, or 8.3 percent, to 11
million. Supplies dropped the most in six weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
