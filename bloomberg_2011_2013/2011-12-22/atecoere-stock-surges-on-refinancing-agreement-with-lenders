Latecoere SA (LAT)  surged the most since
March in Paris trading after saying it refinanced most of its
debt with a group of banks as part of a restructuring program.  Latecoere gained as much as 1.49 euros, or 21 percent, to
8.77 euros, and traded at 8.5 euros as of 11:30 a.m. in Paris.
The stock has gained 21 percent so far this year, valuing the
Toulouse, France-based company at about 73.2 million euros
($95.5 million).  The French company, which is the world’s largest
independent aircraft-door supplier, will refinance 319.8 million
euros of debt, which includes 96 percent of its bank debt, as
well as 60 percent of its convertible bonds. The agreement will
reduce the potential dilution for shareholders, and secure
resources to finance future development programs, the company
said.  Latecoere, which sells doors, wiring and engineering
services to all major airframe makers, has said in recent weeks
that it may choose to remain independent as its finances
improve, while continuing its search for a partner. The company
started to look for an investor or a combination with another
aerospace supplier more than a year ago to gain critical mass as
investment in new planes increases.  Latecoere, whose largest customers are  Airbus (EAD)  SAS and
 Brazil ’s  Embraer SA (EMBR3) , gets about 56 percent of sales from plane
structures. Latecoere supplies doors for four  Boeing Co (BA)  . 787
Dreamliners each month. The company also does wiring and
engineering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
