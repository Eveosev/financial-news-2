Cyprus needs 5 billion euros ($6.5
billion), or 29 percent of gross domestic product, to finance
its fiscal deficit and refinance maturing debt next year,
 Stockwatch  reported today, citing the  European Central Bank .  That amount includes special bonds worth 2.2 billion euros
issued to help banks boost their liquidity; Eurostat, the
European Unionâ€™s statistical body, excludes that from public
debt, the web-based newspaper said.  Click here for Web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
