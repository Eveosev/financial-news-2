(Corrects sales to orders.)  French new car orders declined by
almost 60 percent from Dec. 1 to Dec. 21 versus the year-earlier
period, daily La Tribune reported, citing an unidentified person
speaking in an official capacity.  The drop is in part because December 2010 was the last
month in which incentives to scrap old cars were available, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
