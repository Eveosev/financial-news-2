The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10:24 a.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  gained 0.4 percent to 12,738.59, while the
Colcap Index rose 0.1 percent to 1,587.73.  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB)  , Colombia’s
second-biggest electricity distributor, fell 0.9 percent to
1,135 pesos. Colombia’s Autorregulador del Mercado de Valores, a
private organization authorized by the country’s securities
regulator to help oversee brokers, said it found no proof of
“abuses” by market intermediaries or investors in its
investigation of the company’s three-day plunge that led to a
suspension of trading Dec. 7.  The shares fell after Bogota mayor-elect Gustavo Petro said
he plans to merge the city-run electricity company with other
city-controlled utilities.  Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR)  , the
parent company of  Colombia ’s biggest bank, rose 0.3 percent to
32,000 pesos. Colombia’s securities regulator authorized
Sociedades Bolivar SA to invest in ING Administradora de
Pensiones y Cesantias SA, according to a regulatory filing late
yesterday. Suramericana has said Sociedades Bolivar is among
“co-investors” that will participate in its acquisition of
Latin American assets of ING Groep NV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
