France  raised 2.64 billion euros
selling fourth-generation mobile-phone frequencies in the 800
megahertz band to carriers Orange, SFR and Bouygues Telecom, the
country’s telecom’s regulator Arcep said.  The regulator rejected a bid by Internet company Iliad SA’s
Free unit for one of the licenses, it said in a statement posted
on its website.  French Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  said the auction
results were “excellent news for public finances,” noting that
the reserve price had been 1.8 billion euros. Fillon commented
in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
