The rand strengthened for the fifth
time in six days after U.S jobless claims fell to their lowest
since April 2008 and euro-area banks took larger-than-forecast
loans from the  European Central Bank  in a refinancing offer,
boosting appetite for risk assets.  South Africa ’s currency appreciated as much as 1.8 percent
versus the dollar and traded 1.3 percent stronger at 8.1565 as
of 4:36 p.m. in Johannesburg, the best performer among 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The rand has fallen the most
this year among its emerging-market peers, down 19%. Against the
euro, it strengthened 1.6 percent to 10.6284.  Jobless claims  fell by 4,000 to 364,000 in the week ended
Dec. 17, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median forecast of 45 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected an increase to 380,000.  “Where we had been in a rather shaky environment things
are certainly stabilizing a bit,”  Leon Myburgh , a Johannesburg-
based analyst at Citigroup Inc., said by phone. “Portfolio
flows might improve slight. Commodity prices might recover.”  Foreign investors sold a net 16.9 billion rand ($2 billion)
in South African equities in the year through Dec. 15, according
to data supplied by JSE Ltd., operator of Johannesburg’s stock
exchange. Net purchases of South African bonds reached 46.8
billion rand during the same period. Last year, foreigners
bought a net 57 billion rand of debt and 36.4 billion rand in
equities.  Pressure Easing  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  is scheduled
to speak today after 523 euro-area lenders took a record 489
billion euros ($641 billion) in loans from the Frankfurt-based
central bank yesterday. Banks need to refinance more than 600
billion euros of debt maturing next year, about three-quarters
of which is unsecured, the  Bank of England  said this month.  “The net result is that this should over time ease the
funding pressures on the banks and help support the sovereign
debt markets,”  George Glynos , an economist at Johannesburg-
based ETM Analytics, wrote in e-mailed comments today. “One now
feels there is a greater probability that the dollar-rand heads
back below the 8 rand handle once more.”  South Africa’s 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 advanced for a
sixth day, driving the yield down three basis points or 0.03
percentage point to a two-week low of 6.77 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
