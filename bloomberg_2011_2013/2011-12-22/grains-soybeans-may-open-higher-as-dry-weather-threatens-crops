What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that
overnight rain in northwestern  Argentina  failed to bring relief
to crops after hot, dry weather reduced soil moisture earlier
this month,  Jason Ward , a market analyst for Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT on speculation that rain forecast for  Brazil  during
the next three days will miss the driest growing regions,
worsening crop conditions, Ward said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open 0.2 cent to 0.25 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that demand will increase for the
grain in livestock rations as higher corn prices encourage
substitution, Ward said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
