California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  strengthened to a six-week high against futures on
speculation that maintenance planned for next month will drive
refineries to buy fuel in the spot market.  Carbob in  Los Angeles  jumped 8.25 cents to a premium of
23.75 cents a gallon versus gasoline futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 4:52 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the fuel’s largest premium in
Los Angeles since Nov. 8.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  said it will shut units at the
 Wilmington  refinery for four weeks of work.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  will
cut rates at the  Martinez  refinery next month for a turnaround,
two people familiar with the refinery’s operations said Oct. 5.
At least one refiner was buying in the  spot market , said Bob van der Valk, an independent fuel analyst.  “They are short of pipeline barrels for nomination in
January,” said van der Valk, who is based in Terry,  Montana .  Carbob in  San Francisco  rose for a second day, by 6 cents
to a premium of 20.75 cents versus futures. That’s the highest
level for the fuel in  San Francisco  since Nov. 4.  California-blend diesel, known as CARB diesel, in  Los
Angeles  rose 3.25 cents to a premium of 5.25 cents against
heating oil futures traded on the Nymex. The same fuel in San
Francisco strengthened 3.5 cents to a premium of 5 cents versus
futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
climbed for the sixth day, by 2 cents to a premium of 3 cents to
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
