U.K. renewable power sources
generated 9 percent of the countryâ€™s electricity in the three
months through September, up from 8.1 percent in the third
quarter of 2010, the Department of Energy and Climate Change
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Power generated by offshore  wind turbines  rose by 30.5
percent in the quarter from the same period last year, while
electricity from hydropower gained 41.3 percent as a result of
higher rainfall, the department said. Onshore wind power
declined 2.4 percent due to lower wind speeds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
