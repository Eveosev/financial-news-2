The European Union approved three
genetically modified corn varieties from  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  and a
biotech cotton variety from  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  for food and feed
use, import and processing.  The crops were approved by the European Commission, the
EU’s regulatory arm, after member states failed to provide a
qualified majority either in favor or against the approvals, the
commission said in a  statement  on its website today.  The authorizations are valid for 10 years and will be
subject to the EU’s labelling and traceability rules, the
commission said. The approvals don’t allow for cultivation of
the crops in the 27-nation bloc.  The approved Syngenta corns are  MIR604 x GA21 ,  Bt11 x
MIR604  and  Bt11 x MIR604 x GA21 , all of which combine insect-
resistance traits with herbicide tolerance. The Dow  cotton
variety  authorized by the commission is 281-24-236 x
3006-210-23, which has insect resistance built in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
