Fujitsu Ltd. (6702)  may miss its target to
sell 6.6 million units of personal computers in the year ending
in March, President Masami Yamamoto told reporters in Tokyo
yesterday.  Yamamoto cited scarcity of hard-disk drives because of
floods in  Thailand  as a reason for missing the forecast. He
didn’t provide a new target for the current fiscal year.  Part-shorages “will likely ease around February to
March,” he said, reiterating the company’s target to sell 10
million personal computers in the year to March 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
