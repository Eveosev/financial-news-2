St. Louis Rams wide receiver Austin Pettis was suspended without pay for four games for violating
the  National Football League ’s rules on performance-enhancing
substances.  “Austin’s situation is unfortunate,” Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo said in a statement released yesterday by the team.
“Obviously, we are disappointed and will miss him during this
suspension, but the NFL’s policies are very clear and we respect
the league’s decision in this matter.”  Pettis, a rookie from Boise State who has made three starts
this season and has 27 catches for 256 yards, apologized to the
Rams, teammates and fans “for making a poor decision” in a
statement to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  “I tried Adderall, but I failed to follow the proper
procedures set forth by the NFL before using such medication,”
Pettis said in the statement. “I accept full responsibility and
must endure the consequences for my action. I promise to emerge
on the other side of this suspension as a better person and
player.”  Adderall is a stimulant that is prescribed to treat
narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Pettis, 23, will not be eligible to return until after the
Rams’ second game next season, though he can participate in
offseason and preseason practices and games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
