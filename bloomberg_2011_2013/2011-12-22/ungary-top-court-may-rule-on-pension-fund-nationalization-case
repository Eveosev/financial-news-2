Hungaryâ€™s  Constitutional Court  will
consider a case next week brought by mandatory private-pension
fund members against the government after the effective
nationalization of retirement savings.  Justices will consider the case at its Dec. 28 session, the
Budapest-based court said in an agenda published on its  website 
today.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  last year forced more than 3
million private-pension fund members to turn over retirement
savings to the government or lose the right to a state pension.
The government effectively nationalized $13 billion in private-
pension fund assets this way and used it to plug budget holes.  About 100,000 members remained with the funds. The
government will continue to claim all of their pension-related
contributions indefinitely, Orban said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
