Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE) , the Bermuda-
based insurer and reinsurer, said flooding in Thailand will cost
it $100 million to $125 million after the reinstatement of
premiums and taxes.  The estimate is based on industrywide losses of $10 billion
to $15 billion, the company said today in a statement. The
company also said it expected to increase its loss estimate for
the March earthquake in Japan by $26 million.  The Thailand floods added to the insurance industry’s
second-worst year on record for catastrophe losses, Swiss Re,
the world’s No. 2 reinsurer, said in a report this month.
Earthquakes in Japan and  New Zealand  as well as U.S. tornadoes
fueled claims of  $108 billion . That’s second only to 2005, when
 Hurricanes Katrina , Rita and Wilma contributed to $123 billion
in industry losses, Swiss Re said.  “For 2011, Everest will have incurred significant
catastrophe losses but the company’s balance sheet remains
strong and well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities
for 2012,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph V. Taranto said in the statement.  The reinsurer was little changed at $82.05 today in  New
York  and has declined 3.2 percent this year, compared with the
14 percent slide in the 24-company KBW Insurance Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
