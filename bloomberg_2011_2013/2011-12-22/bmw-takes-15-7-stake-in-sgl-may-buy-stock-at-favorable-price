Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, bought a 15.7 percent
stake in lightweight-materials partner  SGL Carbon SE  and said it
may add to the holding depending on the shares’ performance.  BMW owned the stake as of Dec. 20 and has said it doesn’t
plan on any board or strategy changes, Wiesbaden, Germany-based
SGL said today in a statement. The car manufacturer doesn’t plan
to increase the holding for the next 12 months, though it may
buy stock in the event of a “favorable opportunity” or to
prevent dilution of its  voting rights , SGL said.  The automaker, based in Munich, said on Nov. 18 that it had
secured a 15.16 percent stake in SGL, the world’s largest maker
of carbon and graphite products. The companies have a $100
million joint-venture plant near  Seattle  that produces carbon
fibers for car-body composites.  Volkswagen AG ,  Europe ’s biggest
carmaker and the owner of BMW competitor Audi, also holds a
stake in SGL.  SGL fell as much as 4.3 percent to 37.89 euros, the lowest
intraday price since Oct. 14, and was down 4 percent at 1:10
p.m. in Frankfurt. That pared the stock’s gain this year to 41
percent. BMW rose 0.5 percent to 52.78 euros.  The biggest shareholder in SGL is SKion GmbH, an investment
vehicle of Susanne Klatten, a member of the Quandt family that
owns 47 percent of BMW. The SKion and BMW holdings are legally
separate, with no pooling planned, a spokesman for Klatten said
on Nov. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
