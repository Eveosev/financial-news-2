Sweden ’s Financial Supervisory
Authority will monitor if plans to enforce greater capital
requirements on the nation’s banks leads to wider mortgage
lending margins, Financial Markets Minister Peter Norman said in
an opinion piece in Expressen.  “Swedish banks are today profitable and well
capitalized,” Norman said in the Stockholm-based newspaper.
“An adjustment to new requirements should be able to occur
without any larger effects to the conditions for services to
households and companies.”  The Nordic country wants to shield taxpayers from potential
losses at its biggest banks, whose combined assets are more than
four times the size of the economy. Nordea Bank AB, SEB AB,
Swedbank AB and Svenska Handelsbanken AB will be required to
have common equity Tier 1 capital of at least 10 percent of
their risk-weighted assets from January 2013 and 12 percent in
2015, the government said on Nov. 25.  Swedish banks may suffer from having stricter  capital
requirements  than their European and U.S. competitors, Christian
Clausen, chief executive officer of Nordea, said in a Dec. 12
interview.  Sweden’s central bank on Dec. 20 cut its benchmark repo
rate for the first time since 2009 to 1.75 percent, citing
weakening growth prospects and inflationary pressure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
