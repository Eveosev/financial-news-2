Taiwan’s  government bonds  snapped a
four-day decline and the currency weakened as the lingering
European debt crisis dims the outlook for the island’s exports.  Taiwan may report tomorrow that industrial production
dropped 2.8 percent in November from a year earlier, the first
decrease since August 2009, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Export orders rose 2.54
last month, the least in two years, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs reported on Dec. 20. Taiwan is due to announce its 2012
debt-sale plan tomorrow.  “Yields dropped slightly today as there’s some demand for
the safety of government bonds,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based
fixed-income trader at Polaris Securities Co. “Traders are
speculating that issuance in 2012 will be more than this year.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes maturing in September
2021 fell to 1.276 percent from 1.281 percent yesterday, prices
from Gretai Securities Market show. Benchmark 10-year rates have
dropped 28 basis points this year.  Central bank Governor Perng Fain-nan and his board will
leave  interest rates  unchanged at 1.875 percent when they review
borrowing costs on Dec. 29, nine of 11 economists in a Bloomberg
survey predict. Two expect a cut to 1.750 percent.  Stock indexes (MXAP)  slipped across  Asia  today as banks sought
more cash from the  European Central Bank  than economists had
predicted, reducing optimism the region’s debt crisis will be
contained.  The  Taiwan dollar  fell 0.1 percent to NT$30.325 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
gained 0.1 percent in 2011.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.398 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
