German farmers increased planting of
winter crops for the 2012 harvest by 3.2 percent compared with
the area harvested this year, the government statistics office
said.  By the end of November, 5.52 million hectares (13.6 million
acres) of winter grain and oilseed areas were seeded, up from
5.34 million hectares cultivated this year, the Statistisches
Bundesamt Deutschland said in an online  report  today.  Germany  is the European Union’s second-largest grain grower
after  France . The rapeseed area harvested this year was lower
than what had been planted in 2010 because of winterkill and
other damage, according to the German oilseed-industry
association.  “These results should be considered as preliminary
planting trends,” the statistics office said, adding that not
all winter damage has been taken into account yet.  Winter-wheat had been sown on 3.23 million hectares,
gaining 2 percent from the 3.17 million hectares cut this year,
the data showed. The winter-barley area climbed 5.1 percent to
1.24 million hectares from 1.18 million hectares.  Rapeseed planting rose 0.8 percent to 1.32 million hectares
as of last month, from 1.31 million hectares harvested this
year, according to the statistics office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
