Hong Kong   stocks (HSI)  fell, snapping two
days of gains, as European banks sought record loans from the
region’s central bank and sales of existing U.S. homes missed
forecasts, damping the global demand outlook.  Exporters and shipping companies led declines.  Li & Fung
Ltd. (494) , the biggest supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., dropped 2.9
percent. Cosco Pacific Ltd., which operates container terminals
in  China  and Greece, dropped 1 percent. Belle International
Holdings Ltd., which makes women’s shoes and leather products,
led Chinese fashion retailers lower.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.2 percent to 18,378.23 at the
close in Hong Kong, after rising 1.9 percent over the past two
days. Twenty-three stocks rose while 21 fell in the 48-member
gauge. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland
companies listed in Hong Kong declined 0.1 percent to 9,944.62.
Shares pared their losses in late trading as European stocks
advanced before the release of U.S. jobless claims and consumer
confidence data.  “The  European Central Bank  doesn’t seem to have stepped up
to the plate for bond buying, which I think is negative, but at
least they are acting as a lender of last resort for banks,”
said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment strategy at
AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under
management. “Pumping money into the banking system is essential
because European banks have to keep up lending to businesses and
consumers, and it’s also essential in taking pressure off the
banks to sell  government bonds .”  The Hang Seng Index fell 20 percent this year as banks and
developers declined on China’s measures to curb inflation and
property prices. Concern Europe will fail to contain its debt
crisis also dragged on shares.  Price-Earnings  Companies in the gauge traded at 10 times forecast
earnings, down from 14.4 times on Dec. 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  trades at
12.6 times.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent
today. The gauge advanced 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.1 percent to 18,415.
The  HSI Volatility Index  slid 6 percent to 24, the lowest since
Aug. 4, indicating options traders expect a swing of 6.9 percent
in the benchmark over the next 30 days.  In Europe, 523 banks in the monetary union took a record
489 billion euros ($639 billion) in three-year loans from the
ECB yesterday, exceeding the median estimate of 293 billion
euros by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank is
offering the loans after saying earlier it wouldn’t prop up the
region with bond purchases. Europe accounts for about 18 percent
of China’s exports, according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  Shippers, HSBC  Cosco Pacific fell 1 percent to HK$8.91.  Hutchinson Whampoa
Ltd. (13) , which gets more than half its revenue from Europe, slipped
as much as 1.5 percent before closing 0.3 percent lower at
HK$65.40.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest lender, declined
0.3 percent to HK$58.95 in Hong Kong.  Companies that sell to the U.S. retreated after sales of
existing homes were short of estimates in November and mortgage
applications fell even as the rates on 30-year fixed loans
declined to the lowest on record.  Li & Fung slid 2.9 percent to HK$14.14. Techtronic
Industries Co., which makes Ryobi power tools, declined 1.2
percent to HK$7.71.  China-based retailers retreated even after a survey by the
People’s Bank of China showed consumers expect less inflation
next year. Belle International dropped 1.3 percent to HK$13.84.
Daphne International Holdings Ltd., a shoe seller, retreated 2
percent to HK$8.40.  China Resources Enterprises Ltd. (291) , which
operates fashion distribution and supermarket businesses,
slipped 1.5 percent to HK$27.05.  ‘Poor Export Outlook’  “There’s no confidence in the market and the worry is
focused on the economic slowdown and a poor export outlook,”
said Wu Kan, a  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “Investors are worried the government
doesn’t have many tools to bolster growth now as debt levels are
now higher than a couple of years ago.”  More Chinese bankers are forecasting a further loosening in
monetary policy as economic growth slows, another  survey  by the
central bank showed.  Among stocks that rose, China Resources Land Ltd., a state-
owned developer, rose 2.2 percent to HK$12.96 and  Evergrande
Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) , a Guangzhou-based developer, advanced
3.9 percent to HK$3.21.  Chinese developers will benefit from policy easing
expectations, said Masterlink Securities Corp., which remained
positive on the industry. The environment for developers will
improve next year, analyst Dai Kai-yu wrote in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
