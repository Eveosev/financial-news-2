U.S. military forces in Afghanistan
share responsibility for the Nov. 26 border clash that resulted
in the deaths of 24 Pakistani soldiers, a Defense Department
statement said today.  “Inadequate coordination by U.S. and Pakistan military
officers” and “our reliance on incorrect mapping information”
helped allow the battle to take place, the statement said.
“For the loss of life -- and for the lack of proper
coordination between U.S. and Pakistani forces that contributed
to those losses -- we express our deepest regret,” the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
