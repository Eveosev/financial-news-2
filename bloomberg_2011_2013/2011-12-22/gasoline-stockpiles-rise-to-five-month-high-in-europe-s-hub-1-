Gasoline stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, rose to a five-month high because of imports, according to
PJK International BV.  Gasoline  inventories increased 3.4 percent to 668,000
metric tons in the week to today, according to PJK, a researcher
in the Netherlands. That’s the most since July 28. Supplies
arrived from  France ,  Latvia ,  Russia ,  Sweden  and the U.K., while
product was sent to the U.K., the U.S. and West Africa.  The rise is “influenced by incoming cargoes rather than
barge movements,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by phone
from Oosterhout, where the company is based. “Demand is also
still fairly slow.”  Inventories of gasoil, including heating oil and diesel,
rose by 0.2 percent to 2.06 million metric tons as fuel arrived
from Cuba,  Finland ,  Lithuania  and the U.S., according to PJK.
Shipments were sent to Nigeria and Senegal.  Fuel oil  stockpiles fell for a second week, dropping by 5
percent to 685,000 tons, PJK data show. That’s the lowest level
since July 21.  Jet fuel  inventories declined 6.3 percent to 554,000 tons
even as supplies arrived from  India  and the United Arab
Emirates, the data show.  Naphtha  inventories decreased 11
percent to 94,000 tons even as supplies arrived from Russia.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
