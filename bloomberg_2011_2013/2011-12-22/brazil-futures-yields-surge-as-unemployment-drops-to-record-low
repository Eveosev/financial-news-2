Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts rose the most in three weeks after a report
showing November unemployment fell to a record low boosted
speculation the central bank will continue to cut borrowing
costs at a moderate pace.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 jumped
13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 9.96 percent at
9:49 a.m. in Sao Paulo.  The yields surged after  Brazil ’s unemployment rate dropped
to the lowest on record in November, signaling a tight labor
market and strong consumer demand that could pressure inflation
and limit policy makers’ room to reduce  interest rates .
Unemployment fell to 5.2 percent last month, the national
statistics agency said today. The median estimate of 36
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 5.7 percent.  “One shouldn’t expect an acceleration of rate cuts,”
 Luciano Rostagno , chief strategist at Banco West LB in Sao
Paulo, said in a telephone interview. “The central bank should
maintain its strategy of moderate adjustments.”  The real advanced 0.5 percent to 1.8504 per dollar, from
1.8597 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
