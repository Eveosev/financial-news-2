Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to keep Erha crude exports in February unchanged
at four cargoes, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The country will also ship three consignments of Amenam,
one of Pennington and one of Okwori crude, the plan showed. The
sizes of cargoes range from 650,000 barrels to 1 million
barrels.  Shipping schedules of Akpo and Oso grades are not yet
available.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
