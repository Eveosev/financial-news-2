The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will boost crude supplies to the highest
level in nine months as  Libya  continues to restore production,
according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC will ship  23.63 million barrels a day in the four
weeks to Jan. 7, up from the 23.23 million barrels shipped daily
in the month to Dec. 10, the Halifax, England-based researcher
said today in an e-mailed report. Libya is exporting about
500,000 barrels a day, according to the company.  “It’s nearly all Libya,” Roy Mason, founder of Oil
Movements, said by phone. “The  Middle East  has reached a peak
for the winter. The increase is a more or less normal winter
event; the real difference is the Libyans are adding to it.”  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, are set to increase by 1.7 percent to
17.86 million barrels a day, compared with 17.57 million in the
four weeks to Dec. 10, according to estimates from Oil
Movements.  Crude on board tankers will average 484.77 million barrels
in the four-week period to Jan. 7, up 0.3 percent from 483.28
million in the period to Dec. 10, according to today’s report.
Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-rental
agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships as
floating storage.  OPEC’s members, which pump 40 percent of the world’s oil,
are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
 Nigeria , Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
