TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ,  Sweden ’s largest
telephone company, will take over its Kazakh venture for $1.52
billion before holding an initial public offering for the unit
as it seeks to reduce dependence on saturated home markets.  TeliaSonera, which owns 51 percent of GSM  Kazakhstan  LLP
through a partnership with Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, 
agreed to buy the remainder from Kazakhtelecom, the Central 
Asian nation’s fixed-line phone monopoly. It plans to sell a 
25 percent holding of the operator in an initial public 
offering next year, TeliaSonera said today.  To focus on faster growing regions, TeliaSonera has cut 
jobs and trimmed expenses in Sweden and Finland as subscribers
shift from fixed-line subscriptions to smartphones. Tero Kivisaari, the company’s president for central  Asia , said June
14 it aims to keep revenue growth in the area in double digits
even as long-term growth may slow as markets like Azerbaijian
and Kazakhstan near 100 percent mobile penetration.  “They are buying an asset they know well for what seems
like a good price,” said Stefan Gauffin, an analyst at Nordea
Bank AB who recommends buying TeliaSonera shares. “The expected
growth in Kazakhstan will outstrip the current company
average.”  Market Leader  The price TeliaSonera pays is about 4.6 to 4.7 times the
unit’s 2011 projected earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortization, said Gauffin. Peers in the
 emerging markets  are trading at about 5.5 times earnings, he
said.  TeliaSonera, formed in a 2002 merger between the former
Swedish and Finnish phone monopolies, slid 0.5 percent to 44.79
kronor at 11:49 a.m. in  Stockholm . The stock has dropped 16
percent this year, valuing the company at 194 billion kronor
($28 billion)  TeliaSonera controls 51 percent of GSM Kazakhstan through
its 58.55 percent ownership in Fintur Holdings B.V., the venture
with Turkcell,  Turkey ’s biggest mobile-phone company.
TeliaSonera owns 38 percent of Turkcell.  “This agreement is another step in the execution of our
strategy of increasing ownership in core holdings,” Kivisaari
said in a statement.  Kcell’s IPO is expected to be completed next year,
TeliaSonera said. Depending on the share-price development after
the sale, the Swedish company may make an additional payment to
Kazakhtelecom, it said. Kcell has about 50 percent of the Kazakh
market and some 8.9 million subscribers, according to
TeliaSonera’s website.  Turkcell Stake  After the IPO, TeliaSonera will hold an effective stake of
61.7 percent in the operator, it said today.  TeliaSonera and  Russia ’s Alfa Group are embroiled in a
dispute with Cukurova Holding over control of Turkcell and have
pressed for the replacement of Chairman  Colin Williams . The
dispute has prevented the approval of dividends from last year’s
profit. A Turkcell spokesman couldn’t immediately be reached for
comment.  Kazakhstan, the former Soviet Union’s second-biggest energy
producer, plans to sell shares of state-owned companies to
citizens in IPOs, Economic Development and Trade Minister  Kairat
Kelimbetov  said in a Sept. 16 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
