U.S. stock futures maintained gains
after jobless claims unexpectedly dropped last week while
another report showed the economy grew less than previously
estimated in the third quarter.  S&P 500  futures expiring in March rose 0.6 percent to
1,243.60 at 8:36 a.m. New York time. The benchmark gauge added
3.2 percent over the previous two days.  The number of applications for  unemployment benefits 
dropped last week to the lowest since April 2008, a sign that
the U.S. labor market is strengthening heading into 2012.
Jobless claims fell by 4,000 to 364,000 in the week ended
Dec. 17, Labor Department figures showed. The median forecast of
45 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected an increase
to 380,000.  Gross domestic product climbed at a 1.8 percent annual rate
from July through September, down from the 2 percent estimated
last month, revised Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 82 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected it would hold at 2 percent. Household
purchases increased at a 1.7 percent rate, down from 2.3
percent.  A two-day rally in the S&P 500 trimmed this year’s decline
to 1.1 percent through yesterday. The index was still down 8.8
percent from this year’s high in April, joining a global rout in
equities, as concern about Europe’s debt crisis overshadowed
better-than-estimated American economic data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
