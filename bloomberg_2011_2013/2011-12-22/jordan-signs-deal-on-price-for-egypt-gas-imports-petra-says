Jordan signed an agreement on the
price of natural  gas  imports from  Egypt , the country’s official
Petra news agency said, citing Energy Minister Qutaiba Abu Qura.  The deal was signed in Cairo yesterday, after the two
governments approved the prices, he said, without disclosing the
price or saying when they would take effect.  Egypt’s North Sinai gas pipeline, which transports the fuel
to Jordan and  Israel , was attacked on Dec. 18 for a 10th time
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
