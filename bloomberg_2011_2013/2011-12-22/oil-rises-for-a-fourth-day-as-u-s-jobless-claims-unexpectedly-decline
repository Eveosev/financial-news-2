Oil rose for a fourth day as
applications for  unemployment  benefits in the U.S. decreased to
a three-year low and the index of U.S. leading indicators
signaled that economic growth will accelerate.  Futures advanced 0.9 percent after reports that  jobless
claims  dropped by 4,000 to 364,000 last week and leading
indicators climbed more than forecast in November. U.S.  oil
supplies  fell the most in a decade last week, the Energy
Department said yesterday.  “We’re in an up trend and may have further to go,” said
 Tom Bentz , a director in New York with BNP Paribas Prime
Brokerage Inc. “The inventory number yesterday surprised a lot
of people and added to the rally. The jobless numbers today gave
us an initial boost but we ran into resistance around $100.”  Crude oil for February delivery increased 86 cents to
$99.53 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Dec. 13. Prices have advanced 8.9 percent in
2011 after climbing 15 percent in 2010.  Brent oil for February settlement rose 18 cents to $107.89
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The

barrel today, the smallest differential since March 8. The
spread surged to a record high of $27.88 on Oct. 14.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months rose 0.5 percent after a 0.9 percent October
increase, the New York-based research group said today. The
median forecast of 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected the gauge would advance 0.3 percent.  Consumer Confidence  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment increased to 69.9 in December from 64.1 at
the end of the previous month. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a reading of 68. This
month’s preliminary reading was 67.7.  “The  U.S. economy  is actually looking OK,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in
Winchester,  Massachusetts . “Sentiment has turned bullish as the
year comes to an end.”  U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell 10.6 million barrels last
week, the largest decrease since February 2001, yesterday’s
Energy Department report showed.  Imports  dropped to 7.58 million
barrels a day, the lowest level since September 2008.  “We’ve got a lot of momentum here,” said Chris Dillman,
an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “We still have to see if the market will be able
to break through $100.”  Decreasing Volume  Oil touched $100.05 at 1:32 p.m. before dropping back on
one of the year’s slowest trading days. Volume on the Nymex
totaled 252,037 contracts as of 3:28 p.m. Volume was 409,324
yesterday, the lowest level of the month and down more than half
from Dec. 13. Open interest was 1.3 million contracts.  “We’ve had some strong economic numbers and equities are
in the midst of a nice three-day pop,” said  Stephen Schork ,
president of Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “The
main reason for this rally is that we’re approaching the end of
the year and there’s no liquidity. The path of least resistance
is up.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.8 percent, the third
straight gain and the fifth in six days.  New York oil will average $100 a barrel next year as the
U.S. averts recession, while Brent will decline from the 2011
mean, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  The forecast for West Texas Intermediate oil, the U.S.
benchmark, is based on the median of 27 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, topping the all-time high of $99.75 set
in 2008. WTI is on course to average $95 a barrel in 2011. Brent
will average $109 next year, versus $110.98 so far this year.  Iranian Sanctions  Oil is up 26 percent this quarter, the biggest gain since
the second quarter of 2009, as the European Union and the U.S.
seek support from the  Middle East  and  Asia  for sanctions against
 Iran , the second-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  EU nations, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific allies discussed
possible measures in  Rome  on Dec. 20 and vowed to increase
pressure on Iran to abandon a suspected nuclear weapons program,
according to an Italian Foreign Ministry statement.  Iran’s navy will hold 10 days of maneuvers east of the
Strait of Hormuz, state-run Fars news agency reported today,

Energy Department.  Civilians were targeted in bombings across  Baghdad  that
killed 57 people amid an escalation of political infighting in

country. U.S. troops from the country. Today’s attacks also
injured 176, Ziad Tariq, a spokesman for the Health Ministry,
said by phone from the city.  “The upsurge in violence in Iraq is probably adding to the
oil price,” Lynch said. “Chances are that there will be no
impact on the oil industry, but the increase in violence does
add to a perception of instability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
