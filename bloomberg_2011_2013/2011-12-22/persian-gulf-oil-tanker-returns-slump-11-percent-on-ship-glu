Returns  for the largest  oil tankers 
hauling 2 million-barrel cargoes of Middle East crude to  Asia 
dropped 11 percent as the supply of available ships exceeded the
number of cargoes.  Rental income for very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, on
the benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route fell 11 percent to
$12,147 a day, according to the  Baltic Exchange  in London.
That’s a decrease of 25 percent from the start of the year.  Tanker owners are contending with a fleet that’s expanding
faster than cargo growth. Global demand for VLCCs will rise 5.2
percent to 147.4 million deadweight tons this year, according to
Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest
shipbroker. The fleet will swell 8.6 percent to 173.9 million
tons, it estimates.  There are 23 ships available for hire in the  Persian Gulf 
during the first 10 days of January compared with about eight
cargoes, Marex Spectron Group Ltd., a London-based commodities
broker, said in an e-mailed report today. That means there won’t
be any “squeeze” on freight rates, it said.  Hire costs  for VLCCs on the benchmark voyage increased 0.3
percent to 57.98 Worldscale points, according to the bourse. The
points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or flat rate, for
more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for every voyage,
quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually by the
Worldscale Association in London to reflect changing fuel costs,
port tariffs and exchange rates.  Owners can boost returns by reducing a ship’s speed on a
return journey after unloading of cargo, saving on fuel costs.
The exchange’s earnings estimates don’t reflect speed
alterations. The price of ship fuel, or bunkers, advanced 29
percent this year to $653.75 a metric ton, data compiled by
Bloomberg from 25 ports worldwide showed.  The  Baltic Dirty Tanker Index , an overall measure of
shipping crude that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs,
advanced 4.1 percent to 939 points, according to the exchange.
That’s the highest level since March 28, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
