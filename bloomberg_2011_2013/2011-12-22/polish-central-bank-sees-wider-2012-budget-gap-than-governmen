Poland’s plan to narrow the  budget
deficit  by almost half next year may fail as the global economic
outlook sours and the government relies too much on raising
revenue, the  Narodowy Bank Polski  said.  The central bank-led Monetary Policy Council estimates the
2012 shortfall will fall to 3.9 percent of gross domestic
product, while the Cabinet has told the  European Commission  it
plans to cut it by 2.7 percentage points to 2.9 percent.  While the budget is based on “cautious macroeconomic
assumptions,” with the  economic-growth  forecast lowered to 2.5
percent from 4 percent earlier and a “realistic” estimate of
 tax revenue , the government should focus on spending cuts rather
than boosting income, the bank said in an e-mailed statement.  Prime Minister Donald Tusk committed to fiscal discipline
after winning a second four-year term in October, pledging to
raise the  retirement age  and end allowances for farmers. Next
year’s efforts to narrow the deficit also envisage higher
revenue, to be generated by dividends from state-owned
companies, a new mining tax and a payroll-levy increase, which
will help compensate for slower economic growth.  “The achievement of planned deficit reduction by the
government is at risk and relies strongly on discretionary
actions,” the Monetary Policy Council said. “The uncertain
macroeconomic situation in  Europe  and all over the world poses
another risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
