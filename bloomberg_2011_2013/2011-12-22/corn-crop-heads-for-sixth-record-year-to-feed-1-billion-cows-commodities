Farmers will reap a record corn crop
for a sixth consecutive season in 2012, slowing a slump in
stockpiles of  livestock  feed as global meat demand approaches a
quarter of a billion metric tons.  Production will rise 4.8 percent to 867.5 million metric
tons in 2011-12, curbing the drop in inventories to 0.8 percent,
the smallest decline in three years, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates. With harvests expanding from  Argentina  to
China, prices will fall as much as 31 percent to $4.305 a bushel
in Chicago trading next year, according to the median of 24
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.  Corn prices doubled in the past two years as farmers failed
to keep up with meat consumption that expanded 62 percent in a
generation. Stockpiles fell in eight of the past 12 years and
are down 34 percent since 2000, contributing to a surge in world
food costs. Growers are now planting the most corn ever and more
feed will come from a projected record wheat harvest.  “Farmers have responded to record prices by producing
historic crops,” said  Bill Gary , the president of Commodity
Information Systems Inc. in  Oklahoma City , who has worked in
grain markets for a half century. “There will not be a big
bullish argument for the corn market in months ahead.”  Corn already tumbled 20 percent to $6.22 on the Chicago
Board of Trade since reaching a three-month high of $7.79 on
Aug. 29. The grain fell 1.1 percent this year, compared with an
18 percent slump in the Standard & Poor’s Agriculture Index of
eight commodities. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
dropped 10 percent and Treasuries returned 9.3 percent, a Bank
of America Corp. index shows.  Global Shipments  Output will expand the most in the European Union,  China ,
Ukraine, Argentina, Brazil and  Russia , helping to compensate for
a 1.1 percent drop in the U.S., the biggest grower, the
Washington-based USDA predicts. The U.S. share of global
shipments will drop below 50 percent for the first time since
1971. Farmers are responding to prices that averaged $6.80 a
bushel this year, more than double the past 10 years.  Global production of beef, veal, pork, chicken and turkey
will reach 248.6 million tons next year, 21 percent more than a
decade ago and 62 percent more than in 1992, the USDA estimates.
Total meat consumption per person will rise every year through
at least 2020, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development in Paris and the  Food and Agriculture Organization 
forecast in a June report. Demand will expand almost 73 percent
by 2050, the Rome-based FAO said in a report Dec. 14.  Farm Animals  There were 1.38 billion cattle in 2009, compared with 1.31
billion a decade earlier, the FAO estimates. The global pig
 population  has expanded to 942 million from 894 million in 1999
while farmers added almost 5 billion chickens to 18.6 billion,
the data show. Grazing cattle, which primarily feed on pasture,
account for about a quarter of world beef production, according
to the FAO.  World beef production will reach 56.8 million tons next
year, 2.8 percent less than in 2007, according to the USDA. Pork
will rise 10 percent to 103.4 million tons since 2007 as poultry
advances 17 percent to 88.4 million tons. Farmers will use a
record 640.6 million tons of corn and wheat feed this season,
5.6 percent more than a year earlier, the USDA estimates.  It takes about 2.6 pounds of corn to produce a pound of
beef, compared with 3.6 pounds for pork and 2 pounds for
chicken, according to estimates from the National Pork Board,
the U.S. Cattlemen’s Beef Board and National Chicken Council.  The projected decline in corn prices may be curtailed
should weather hurt crops in  South America , which typically
plants corn this quarter for harvests that begin in March.
Growers are focusing on the La Nina phenomenon which typically
brings heavier rainfall in  Asia  and the Pacific and drier
weather in South America.  Developing Crops  Corn jumped 3.1 percent on Dec. 19 on the CBOT on
speculation that dry and hot weather will slow development of
crops in Argentina and  Brazil , T-Storm Weather LLC said in a
report that day. The weather is similar to 2008-2009, when a La
Nina pattern strengthened in December, the Chicago-based
forecaster said. Argentina’s corn output fell 30 percent that
season while Brazil’s declined 13 percent.  Livestock farmers will use more wheat, after prices fell 22
percent this year. Wheat-feed use will advance 9 percent to
125.5 million tons, the most in about two decades, the London-
based International Grains Council estimates.  Less Bullish  For now, speculators are getting less bullish on the grain,
the world’s biggest food crop by volume.  Hedge funds  and other
money managers are holding a net-long  position , or bets on
higher prices, of 127,666 futures and options, data from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. That’s down from as
many as 408,854 contracts in January. The most widely held
option gives holders the right to sell corn at $5 by the end of
February, CBOT data show.  Greater demand may also come from ethanol refiners. About
30 percent of U.S. corn went into producing the fuel in 2008,
compared with 11 percent in 2002, according to the Journal of
Applied Poultry Research of the Champaign, Illinois-based
Poultry Science Association.  Ethanol  production in the U.S. is forecast to climb 2.2
percent next year to 920,000 barrels a day, the Energy
Department said in its most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook
report. That’s an annual production rate of 14.1 billion
gallons, up from 13.8 billion in 2011, according to Energy
Department data.  “We’ve had farmers all over the world ramp up
production,” said  Dave Norris , an independent broker in
Harrogate,  England , who has been trading grains since 1979. “It
should come as no surprise that these bumper crops ultimately
send prices crashing.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
