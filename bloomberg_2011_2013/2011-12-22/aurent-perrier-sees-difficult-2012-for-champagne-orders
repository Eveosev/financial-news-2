Laurent Perrier SA (LPE) , the maker of
Grand Siecle champagne, said orders may deteriorate in 2012 as
shipments of the sparkling wine slow in the last two months of
this year, Chief Financial Officer Etienne Auriau said.  Demand for Tours-Sur-Marne, France-based Laurent Perrier’s
champagne “is dynamic but without doubt 2012 will be more
difficult,” Auriau said in a phone interview. “Consumption is
very tied to the economic situation.”  Champagne volumes are set to climb as much as 2.6 percent
to 328 million bottles in 2011, Auriau said. While shipments may
increase 1.3 percent in November and December compared to last
year, according to Auriau’s forecast, the annual estimate is
below an industry peak in 2007 and follows 3.5 percent growth in
the first 10 months of the year, according to industry group
 Comite Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne .  Laurent Perrier fell 1.7 percent to 71.56 euros in Paris
trading. The shares have fallen 11 percent this year, giving the
maker of the Salon, Delamotte and Champagne de Castellane brands
a market value of 425.5 million euros ($555 million.)  Entry-level and top-of-the-range champagnes are the most
popular, said Fabien Hyon, CEO of  1855 (AL185) , a Paris-based wine
Internet retailer in an interview.  Mid-Range Bubbly  “It’s more in the middle that it’s harder to sell at the
moment,” the CEO said, adding that 1855’s champagne sales were
up 15 percent on last year.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the world’s largest
champagne maker, reported a 6 percent increase in volumes at the
end of September on a comparable basis, slowing from a 10
percent gain in the first half. While consumer demand remains
robust, LVMH is watching the levels of inventories at retailers,
the maker of the Moet,  Veuve Clicquot  and Dom Perignon brands
said in October.  American and Japanese drinkers may compensate for any
slowdown in  Europe  as Laurent Perrier exports three-quarters of
its champagne, Auriau said. First-half net income more than
tripled to 9.49 million euros from a year earlier driven by
demand for premium champagne, Laurent Perrier said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
