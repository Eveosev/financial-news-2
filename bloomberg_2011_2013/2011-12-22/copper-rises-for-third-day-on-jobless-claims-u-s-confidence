Copper climbed for a third day, the
longest rally this month, as U.S. reports showed an improved
labor outlook and gains in  consumer confidence , boosting demand
prospects for the metal used in pipes and wires.  Jobless claims unexpectedly dropped to the lowest since
April 2008, a sign that the labor market in the world’s second-
largest copper consumer is strengthening heading into 2012.
Consumer confidence climbed to a six-month high. Personal
spending probably increased in November, economists said before
a report tomorrow.  “The bottom in copper is already in,”  Michael Smith , the
president of T&K Futures & Options in Port St. Lucie, Florida,
said in a telephone interview. “It’s all about optimism in the
U.S., about getting people to spend more and put more money into
stocks and commodities.”  Copper futures for delivery in March rose 0.6 percent to
close at $3.4155 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
The price gained 2.6 percent in the previous two sessions as
Chinese imports of the industrial metal climbed to the highest
since June 2009.  Prices have dropped 23 percent this year as debt woes
escalated in the U.S. and Europe and demand slowed in  China , the
biggest copper user. The metal touched a 14-month low of $2.994
on Oct. 3.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 1.1 percent to $7,540 a metric ton ($3.42 a pound).  Tin, aluminum and lead also climbed in London. Nickel and
zinc fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
