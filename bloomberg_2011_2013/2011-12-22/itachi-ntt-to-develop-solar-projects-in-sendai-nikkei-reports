Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  and four  Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (9432)  group companies will set up solar
projects in an area hit by the March earthquake and tsunami, the
Nikkei newspaper  said  today.  The companies plan to install solar panels on homes, build
a solar farm and set up smart grids by March 2016 in an inland
section of Sendai city in Miyagi prefecture to set up a “smart
city,” the paper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  About 1,000 residential units are expected to be built in
the area, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
