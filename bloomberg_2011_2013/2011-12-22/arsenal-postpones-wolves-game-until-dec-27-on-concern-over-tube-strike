Arsenal has postponed its Premier
League soccer match against  Wolverhampton Wanderers  by 24 hours
to Dec. 27 because of proposed industrial action on  London
Underground .  Yesterday, London Underground Ltd. asked a court to block
train drivers from the Associated Society of Locomotive
Engineers and Firemen union going on strike for four days,
including the day after Christmas, over their holiday pay.  “This decision has had to be made now, before the result
of the legal challenge to the proposed industrial action is
finally known, due to the preparation period needed to safely
operate Emirates Stadium by all the relevant agencies,” Arsenal
said in a statement on the club’s website.  Chelsea said yesterday that its game against Fulham on Dec.
26 will go ahead.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
