Brazil ’s primary budget surplus will
exceed the target this year, Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin
said.  The public surplus, which includes the central government,
states and cities, will be a “little above” the 127.9 billion
reais ($68.9 billion) goal, Augustin told reporters in Brasilia
today.  “It’s positive to reach the fiscal target,” said  Jankiel
Santos , chief economist at Espirito Santo Investmente Bank, by
phone from Sao Paulo. “It shows there is some spending
control.”  According to Treasury data, central government posted a 4.6
billion-real primary surplus in November, bringing the surplus
for the first 11 months to 91.1 billion reais. The target for
the whole year is 91.76 billion reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
