  U.K. stocks (UKX)  rallied the most this
month after U.S. jobs and consumer-confidence data indicated the
world’s largest economy is recovering.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  led a rally in banks,
climbing 4 percent. International Consolidated Airlines Group SA
jumped 3.3 percent after reaching a binding agreement to buy
Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s BMI unit.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index gained 67.23, or 1.3 percent,
to 5,456.97 at the close in  London , the largest advance since
Nov. 30. The gauge has still lost 7.5 percent this year amid
concern that the euro-area debt crisis will weaken global
growth. The broader FTSE All-Share Index climbed 1.2 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 0.9 percent.  “Encouraging data has assisted with today’s rally,” said
 Angus Campbell , head of sales at Capital Spreads in London. “A
word of caution comes with today’s move higher however as it was
on the back of very low volumes.”  Stocks climbed as U.S. jobless claims fell to the lowest
level since April 2008, a sign that America’s labor market is
strengthening heading into 2012. Separately, the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan final  index of consumer sentiment 
increased to 69.9 in December from a previous estimate of 67.7.  U.K. GDP Growth  U.K. economic growth accelerated more than previously
estimated in the third quarter in an increase that the Bank of
England says is unlikely to be repeated as the euro area’s debt
crisis curbs bank lending and dents confidence.  Gross domestic product rose 0.6 percent from the previous
quarter, faster than the 0.5 percent previously estimated, the
Office for National Statistics said today in London.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Bank of
England Governor  Mervyn King  spoke at a press conference in
Frankfurt today after a meeting of the European Systemic Risk
Board. King said that  Europe ’s debt crisis is spilling over into
the real economy and the outlook for financial stability has
worsened.  RBS led a rally in banks today, climbing 4 percent to 20.61
pence.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  gained 2.4 percent to 176.1 pence and  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  advanced 1.8 percent to 488.55 pence.  IAG rose 3.3 percent to 149.9 pence after agreeing to buy
Lufthansa’s BMI unit in the U.K. for 172.5 million pounds
($270.5 million), fending off a counterbid from Virgin Atlantic
Airways Ltd. IAG said the acquisition will boost its operating
profit by 100 million euros in 2015.  Elsewhere, Stagecoach Group Plc, the operator of Britain’s
biggest rail-commuter franchise, retreated 3.4 percent to 260.9
pence after JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its  recommendation (SGC)  for
the company to “underweight” from “overweight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
