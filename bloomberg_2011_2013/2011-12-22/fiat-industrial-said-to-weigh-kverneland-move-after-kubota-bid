Fiat Industrial SpA  is evaluating
whether to raise or retract its offer for  Kverneland ASA (KVE)  after
Japanese competitor  Kubota Corp. (6326)  raised its bid to 1.62 billion
kroner ($272 million), two people familiar with the matter said.  Fiat Industrial has almost completed a due diligence on
Kverneland and is weighing its next move, said the people, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private. A
final decision hasn’t been taken, they said. Fiat Industrial may
decide not to get into a bidding contest, one person said. A
Fiat Industrial spokesman declined to comment.  Kubota, Fiat Industrial and Wuhu, China-based Chery Inc.
have been locked in a three-way contest for the fifth-largest
maker of farm machinery and equipment in  Europe . Fiat Industrial
aims to expand in northern Europe and to widen  CNH (CNH) ’s product
range with Kverneland in its first acquisition since the truck
and tractor maker was spun off from Fiat SpA in January.  Kubota increased the offer to 10.5 kroner a share and
secured an irrevocable agreement for the 31.8 percent stake held
by Umoe AS, the Kverneland, Norway-based company’s largest
shareholder, Kverneland said in a statement yesterday.  The Japanese manufacturer bid 8.5 kroner a share on Dec.
16, to which Fiat Industrial SpA-controlled CNH Global NV
responded with a 9.5-krone offer on Dec. 19.  Kverneland Chairman Jens Ulltveit-Moe, who with family
members owns Umoe AS, also said he will sell 100,000 shares
owned by Kagra Gruppen AS through the offer, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
