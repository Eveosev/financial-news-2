Serbia will turn state-run JAT
Airways into a much smaller carrier that will fly only to
several of the biggest European capitals with 500 workers out of
1,260 at present, Blic newspaper reported, citing JAT managers
it did not name.  After the latest sales tender for the airline failed, the
government may provide guarantees for loans for six new  Boeing
Co. (BA)  or Airbus SAS planes to replace an aging fleet of 14
aircraft, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
