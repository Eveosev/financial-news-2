Further Lane Asset Management LLC,
the fixed-income investment firm with clients including former
Dallas Cowboy defensive end Ed “Too Tall” Jones, has created a
unit that provides advice to bond buyers, Chief Executive
Officer Michael Araiz said.  Clients of the Further Lane Income Solutions division
include family offices, endowments, pension funds and
corporations that oversee $5 billion, said Araiz, the firm’s
owner. The New York-based company also manages about $1 billion
in funds and separate accounts for similar customers and high-
net-worth individuals including Jones, he said.  The new unit, which began this year and focuses on
corporate bonds and securitized debt, “gives us the opportunity
to have a much larger footprint in the business,” Araiz said
yesterday in a telephone interview.  Araiz also owns Further Lane Securities LLC, a San
Francisco-based bond broker that specializes in securitized
bonds backed by mortgages and other assets. In June, that firm
acquired the staff of Hexagon Securities LLC, a competing
broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
