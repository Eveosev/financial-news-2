Aliansce Shopping Centers SA ,
 Brazil ’s fourth-largest shopping mall owner by market value,
rebounded from a four-week low after it agreed to buy an
additional stake in Iguatemi Salvador shopping mall.  Aliansce advanced 0.7 percent to 13.60 reais at 12:29 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, after earlier rising as much as 1.4 percent. The
benchmark Bovespa index rose 0.3 percent.  The company agreed to pay 81.4 million reais ($43.7
million) for a 7.9 percent stake in Iguatemi Salvador mall in
the Brazilian state of Bahia, according to a regulatory filing.
After the deal, Aliansce will own 53.1 percent of Iguatemi
Salvador.  “We highlight the importance of this transaction as
Aliansce will now effectively control this high-quality mall,
with a significant presence in the northeast and potential for
expansions in the future,” Credit Suisse Group AG analysts
including Guilherme Rocha wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
