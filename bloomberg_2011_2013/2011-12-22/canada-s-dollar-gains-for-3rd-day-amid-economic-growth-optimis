Canada ’s dollar appreciated to the
highest in almost two weeks on speculation the economy of the
U.S., the nation’s biggest trading partner, is recovering.  The Canadian currency gained for a third day against the
U.S. dollar as stocks extended weekly gains after initial
jobless claims and  consumer confidence  in the U.S. were better
than forecast. Economists expect a report tomorrow will show
Canada’s economy expanded for a fifth month.  “Stocks have had a great week; the Canadian dollar is
following suit,”  Steve Butler , director of foreign-exchange
trading in Toronto at Bank of  Nova Scotia ’s Scotia Capital unit,
said in an e-mail message. “It looks like markets will stay
risk-on going into year-end.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the aquatic
bird on the dollar coin, gained 0.6 percent to C$1.0203 per  U.S.
dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It reached C$1.0202, the strongest
level in since Dec. 12. It appreciated 0.8 percent to 76.6 yen,
and was up 0.6 percent to C$1.3322 versus the euro. One Canadian
dollar buys 98.01 U.S. cents.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.8 percent and has
added 3.1 percent for the week. Canada’s S&P/TSX Composite Index
rose 1.2 percent has appreciated 3.2 percent this week. Crude
oil, Canada’s biggest export, rose 0.8 percent to $99.48 a
barrel.  Movements in the Canadian dollar have been increasingly
tied to equities. The one-month correlation coefficient between
the gauge of U.S. equities and the Canadian dollar reached
0.9348 on Nov. 14, the strongest relationship since Bloomberg
data began in 1992, versus an average since then of 0.2426. A
reading of 1 indicates the measures move in lockstep. The
reading was 0.8854 today.  Canada’s government bonds have returned 9.6 percent this
year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The
10-year note’s  yield  was little changed at 1.95 percent.  ‘Corporate Repatriation’  The loonie is rising partly because of “corporate
repatriation of foreign revenue back to the Canadian dollar for
year-end,” C.J. Gavsie, managing director for  currency trading 
in Toronto at Bank of Montreal, said in an e-mail message. The
currency will remain stronger as long as the euro stays above
$1.30, he said.  The loonie gaining on optimism about a U.S. economic
recovery is a “fair statement,” Gavsie said, “but everyone is
still on high alert with European debt news.”  A report showed the number of applications for  unemployment
benefits  in the U.S. dropped last week to the lowest since April
2008, a sign that the labor market in the world’s biggest
economy is strengthening heading into 2012.  Revised Commerce Department figures showed gross domestic
product climbed at a 1.8 percent annual rate from July through
September, down from the 2 percent estimated last month.  Consumer Sentiment  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment increased to 69.9 in December from the
previous estimate of 67.7. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey called for 68.  The Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators
may signal continued expansion in the world’s largest economy in
the first half of 2012. The gauge rose 0.3 percent in November
after a 0.9 percent gain the prior month, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The loonie is among the top three performers in Bloomberg
correlation weighted indexes over the past month. It is down 1.9
percent this year for the worst performance in the gauge of 10
developed-nation currencies. The yen has appreciated the most at
3.5 percent, followed by the U.S. dollar at 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
