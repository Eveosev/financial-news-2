Hansteen Holdings Plc (HSTN) , the
industrial real estate investment company founded by Morgan Jones and Ian Watson, acquired 88 properties across the U.K. for
a net 147.1 million pounds ($231 million).  Hansteen acquired the entire real estate portfolio of the
 Spencer Group of Companies , consisting of 4.1 million square
feet (381,000 square meters) of mostly industrial space, the
London-based company said in a statement today.  Hansteen acquired 59 percent of the properties and the rest
was bought by its Hansteen U.K. Industrial Property LP fund,
which is now fully invested. The properties are almost one third
vacant and have the potential to generate an additional 4
million pounds in annual rent, according to the statement. The
purchase also included 37 acres of development land.  The purchase provides “a great opportunity to create
significant added value through improving occupancy and imposing
our own approach,” Morgan Jones, Hansteen’s joint chief
executive officer, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
