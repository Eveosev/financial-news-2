The future of the euro will be
decided in the next six months and the joint currency has “no
future” unless Germany changes its stand,  Peter Bofinger , a
member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s council of economic
advisers, was quoted as saying by  Wirtschaftswoche .  While measures agreed to by European policy makers will
take one to two years to enter into force, the  European Central
Bank  could help by setting a cap for the long-term yields on
Italian and Spanish government bonds, the Dusseldorf-based
magazine quoted Bofinger as saying in an interview released
today to other media ahead of publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
