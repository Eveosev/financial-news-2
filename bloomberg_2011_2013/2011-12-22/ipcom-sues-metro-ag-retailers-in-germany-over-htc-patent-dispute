IPCom GmbH & Co. sued stores of
 Metro AG ’s Media-Saturn unit in  Germany  for selling  HTC Corp. (2498)  3G
mobile phones that it says violate IPCom patents.  IPCom sued about 25 stores, said Thomas Empt, a spokesman
for the Pullach, Germany-based patent-licensing company.  “Since the retailers are fully aware of the court
decisions of patent infringement against HTC, and continue to
sell the handsets despite our request to stop doing so, the
retailers risk being held liable themselves for willfully
infringing our patent,”  Bernhard Frohwitter , managing director
of IPCom, said in a statement.  HTC hasn’t seen a complaint or been contacted by retailers
about any IPCom lawsuit and “is committed to protecting its
partners’ and customers interests,” according to a statement
from an outside spokeswoman in  London . Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC
is still involved in litigation over the validity of the patent.  Dusseldorf, Germany-based Metro’s consumer-electronics
chains Media Markt and Saturn didn’t return a phone call and an
e-mail seeking comment on the suits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
