On Dec. 19, not long after news of  Kim Jong Il 's death went public, the Chinese Communist Party issued a note of condolence reminding the North Korean people that he was " a close friend of the Chinese people ." It’s an innocuous phrase, the sort of thing that the party says about its allies all the time. But unlike past expressions of sympathy and friendship, this one has found little to no support among China’s microblogging masses. As of Dec. 21, they have tweeted 8 million comments related to the Dear Leader on Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging platform, and nearly all of them are scathingly negative. Indeed, rather than join party leaders in  literally bowing down  to Kim Jong Il,  China ’s microbloggers seem far more intent on mocking him and his impoverished country. Feng Hongping , an editor for Vista Magazine -- a glossy, state-owned general interest publication -- took early offense to the Party's expression of friendship with Kim Jong Il. On Dec. 20, in a Weibo post that has been forwarded (or re-tweeted) nearly 400 times, he  wrote : On Dec. 20, Weibo microbloggers began to generate what some on the service quickly labeled China's  joke of the year . They took the line from  Steve Jobs ’s now-famous  2005 Stanford University commencement address  -- "Stay hungry. Stay foolish." -- and  applied it  to North Korea: "Kim Jong Il’s last words to the Korean people: 'Stay hungry. Stay foolish.'" By late afternoon on Dec. 21, the joke had  gone viral . There are hundreds, if not thousands, of arguably better versions of it. For  example : "The entire Korean people have achieved the wishes of the famous Steve Jobs: Stay hungry. Stay foolish!" Or,  more cutting : "Jobs’s greatest legacy is Kim and his son and a country where 24 million people do stay hungry, do stay foolish." This is in stark contrast to the somber exhibitions of Confucian respect that China’s leaders have displayed to North Korean diplomats in Beijing. On Dec. 21, President  Hu Jintao , accompanied by other Politburo members, bowed three times before a portrait of Kim, according to an  account published  by Xinhua, the state-owned newswire. Hu also expressed his -- and the Chinese people’s -- deep grief: The next morning, Premier  Wen Jiabao  and four additional members of China’s Politburo also stopped by the North Korean embassy and  bowed in respect  to the deceased Dear Leader. Some Chinese Communist Party officials  with Weibo accounts  are expressing wonder at the microbloggers' lack of pity for Kim and his people. One of them is  Chi Susheng , a lawyer and member of China’s National People’s Congress. She  tweeted : A day later, a Weibo user with the handle "Shenzhen and Hong Kong Legal Services for Business,"  responded  with a question: "If Hitler dies, do you feel compassion?" There isn’t much middle ground between the Chinese people who devise jokes at the expense of  North Korea  and Chinese leaders who are at increasing pains to express sympathy on their behalf. Chen Wei, an associate professor of political science at Renmin University, took to Weibo to express  his concern  about this division: That distance surely makes party officials uncomfortable. On Dec. 21, the Global Times, known for its hyper-nationalist bent and affiliation with the party mouthpiece newspaper, People’s Daily,  expressed that discomfort  in terms that could make many microbloggers -- already wary of newly announced  government controls  on microblogs –- very uncomfortable: "Some domestic audiences are making fun of North Koreans who grieve for Kim Jong Il on the Internet. It reflects the fact that Chinese society is not that tolerant." Tolerance, in this twisted perspective, means showing "understanding and tolerance" toward the North Korean regime. That regime will now be led by Kim Jong Un, the son of Kim Jong Il, whom Chinese opinion writers and microbloggers are already lampooning. This week, Sun Xingjie, a columnist at China Newsweek, penned a  lengthy editorial  outlining the dangers Kim Jong Un will face, from pressures to reform to power-hungry senior generals. But those pale  in comparison to the challenge posed by technology: "Once the youngsters of the DPRK start to know the world through the Internet and express themselves, the dangers to Kim Jong Un will really start."
