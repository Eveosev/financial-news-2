U.S. fuel demand in November
dropped, pulled lower by a decline in gasoline consumption, the
 American Petroleum Institute  said.  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, declined 1.1 percent to 18.8 million barrels a day last
month from a year earlier, the industry-funded group said today
in a report. Year-to-date consumption has averaged 19 million
barrels a day, down 0.7 percent from the same period in 2010.  Gasoline demand dropped 1.8 percent to 8.65 million barrels
a day last month compared with the same month in 2010. It was
the lowest level of November consumption for the motor fuel
since 2000, according to the report.  “Flagging gasoline demand suggests the consumer sector of
the economy is still treading water,”  John Felmy , chief
economist with the Washington-based API, said in the report.
“The distillate numbers show the industrial sector is faring
better.”  Consumption of distillate fuels, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, rose 4.3 percent to 4.04 million barrels
a day in November, the highest level for the month since 2007.  Demand for ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, climbed 7.9 percent to average 3.66 million barrels a
day, the report showed. Heating-oil use dropped 21 percent to
380,000 barrels a day.  Jet-fuel use climbed 7.5 percent to an average 1.5 million
barrels a day last month compared with the same period in 2010.  Demand for residual fuels plunged 57 percent to 240,000
barrels a day in November from a year earlier, the report
showed. Residual fuel is used for commercial and industrial
heating, electricity generation and ship propulsion.  U.S. crude-oil production fell 2.1 percent to an average
5.43 million barrels a day in November, the department said.
Output in the lower 48 states declined 2.8 percent to 4.81
million barrels a day. Alaskan production increased 3.1 percent
to 625,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
