Focus Media Holdings (FMCN) , a digital
advertising company in  China , rose to a one-week high after a
third-party survey confirmed the size of its network.  The companyâ€™s American depositary receipts rose 3.2 percent
to $20.67 as of 9:57 a.m. New York time. They earlier gained as
much as 4.1 percent to $20.86, the highest intraday level since
Dec. 13. Focus Media has released two reports from independent
surveys this month confirming its advertising network size after
short-selling firm Muddy Waters LLC said last month that the
company was overstating it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
