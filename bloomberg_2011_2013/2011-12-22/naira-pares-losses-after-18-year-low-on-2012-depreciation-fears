Nigeria ’s naira pared its losses
against the dollar after dropping to the weakest on record on
speculation that a rise in  government spending  and removal of
fuel subsidies will cause further depreciation next year.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer declined by 1
percent to the lowest level since at least March 22, 1994,
before cutting the losses 0.4 percent to 163.93 per dollar as of
2:03 p.m. in Lagos, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The government plans to increase expenditure in 2012 by 6
percent to 4.8 trillion naira ($29 billion), President  Goodluck Jonathan  said in a budget speech to lawmakers on Dec. 13.
Jonathan, who won a four-year term in office in April, is under
pressure to curb spending on wages to free up funds that can be
used to build power plants and houses in  Africa ’s most populous
nation.  “The possible removal of fuel subsidy will increase
inflationary pressure,”  Bismarck Rewane , managing director of
Financial Derivatives company Ltd., based in Lagos, said in an
e-mailed note. Rewane expects “increased liquidity to pose a
risk to monetary stability and exchange rate.” The naira is
expected to depreciate to 160 a dollar in 2012 at the official
auction and 163 to a dollar at the interbank, he said.  The central bank on Nov. 21 lowered the midpoint of its
exchange-rate band to 155 naira per dollar from 150 naira as
rising imports and weakening oil prices increased pressure on
the currency. Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy
depends on oil exports for more than 95 percent of foreign
income, according to the  Finance Ministry .  Ghana’s cedi depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 1.6400
per dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
