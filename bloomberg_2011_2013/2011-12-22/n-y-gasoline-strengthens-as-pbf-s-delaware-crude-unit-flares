New York  gasoline rose to its
largest premium in six weeks as  PBF Energy Inc. ’s Delaware
refinery flared gases from a crude unit and oil reached $100 for
the first time in a week.  PBF’s Delaware City refinery reported emissions occurred at
about 5:40 a.m. local time and lasted for at least 20 minutes,
according to a filing with state regulators.  A three-year low in applications for U.S.  unemployment 
benefits and a report that leading indicators climbed more than
forecast in November, signaling that economic growth will
accelerate, helped drive the oil price.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in  New York  rose
0.37 cent to a premium of 2 cents a gallon versus futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:27 p.m., the biggest
premium since Nov. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt delivery gained 2.3 cents a gallon to $2.6592.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel versus heating
oil futures gained 0.12 cent to 3.5 cents a gallon in New York.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  narrowed 0.37 cent to 5.88 cents a gallon as of 2:26
p.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
