Pork stockpiles in the U.S. rose 5.8
percent at the end of November from a year earlier, the
government said, as production increased and demand from  China 
declined.  Warehouses held 494.9 million pounds of pork, up from 468
million on Nov. 30, 2010, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today in a report. Inventories rose 1.3 percent from the
end of October.  U.S. pork  output  in the 10 months through Oct. 31 totaled
18.6 billion pounds (8.4 million metric tons), up 1.6 percent
from the same period in 2010, government data show. Wholesale-
 pork  prices fell 8.5 percent in November, the biggest monthly
decline since October 2010, according to the USDA. Reduced
demand from China, the world’s biggest pork consumer, kept
stockpiles up last month, said  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught
Futures Insights in Altus,  Arkansas .  “The Chinese had bought quite aggressively earlier in the
autumn and quit in October,” Vaught said in a telephone
interview before the report. “That freed up a lot of pork.
Prices were considerably weaker last month. ”  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.5 percent to
83.725 cents a pound at 11:10 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Before today, the price gained 4.4 percent this year.  As of Nov. 30, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, fell 29 percent from a year earlier
to 26.8 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham fell 6.4 percent to 94.7 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of November were 14
percent smaller than a year earlier at 659 million pounds, the
USDA said. Beef supplies rose 0.5 percent to 437.6 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
