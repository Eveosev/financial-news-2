Russian billionaire  Vagit Alekperov ,
head of the country’s No. 2 oil producer  OAO Lukoil , expects
crude prices to average about $115 a barrel next year,  Vedomosti 
newspaper reported, citing an interview.  Lukoil based its 2012 budget on $96 a barrel, though prices
will more likely average $110 to $120, Alekperov was cited as
saying in an interview.  Alekperov, 61, said he’s “grooming” a successor and plans
to pick one of five to seven Lukoil executives on his shortlist,
Vedomosti said. Alekperov said his son Yusuf is due to graduate
from an oil institute next year and may work for the company in
Siberia to gain experience in the field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
