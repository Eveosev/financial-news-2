Vietnam ’s five-year government bonds
fell on speculation the central bank will hold interest rates at
a three-year high to cool inflation.  Consumer prices rose 18.12 percent this month from a year
earlier, Nguoi Lao Dong newswire reported today, citing Minister
of Planning and Investment Bui Quang Vinh. That is higher than
the government’s revised 2011 target of about 18 percent. Policy
makers aim to reduce the pace of price gains to less than 10
percent next year. The central bank raised its refinance rate by
1 percentage point in October to 15 percent, the highest level
since 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The government aims to curb inflation, so  interest rates 
may not decline soon,” said Cao Tan Phat, Ho Chi Minh City-
based analyst at ACB Securities Inc.  Yields  on the five-year debt rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 12.49 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong gained 0.2 percent to 21,010 per dollar as of 4:00
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,813, unchanged since
Dec, its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to
1 percent on either side of the official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
