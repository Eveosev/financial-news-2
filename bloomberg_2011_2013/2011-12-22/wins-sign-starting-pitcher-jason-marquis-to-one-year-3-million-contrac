The  Minnesota  Twins signed veteran
starting pitcher Jason Marquis to bolster their rotation as they
look to rebound from the franchise’s worst season in 29 years.  Marquis, 33, and the Twins have agreed on a one-year, $3
million deal, team spokesman Mike Herman said in an e-mail. The
right-handed pitcher was 8-6 last year in 23 starts with the
Washington Nationals and Arizona Diamondbacks.  The Twins were 63-99 last season, and finished fifth in the
five-team  American League  Central division. The 99 losses were
Minnesota’s highest total since the Major League Baseball team
finished 60-102 in 1982.  Marquis is 104-98 with a 4.55 earned-run average in 12
seasons with six different teams. He was an All-Star in 2009
with the  Colorado Rockies .  Twins starters last year combined for a 4.64 ERA, the
third-highest in the American League, according to their
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
