Four tankers have been booked so far
to load 420,000 metric tons of crude oil in  Libya  this week,
according to data from Poten & Partners Inc.  The ships have been chartered to pick up the equivalent of
about 3.1 million barrels, compared with about 2.7 million
barrels booked to load on four vessels last week, the New York-
based shipbroker’s figures show.  Oil exports from Libya, the holder of  Africa ’s largest
reserves, ceased amid the uprising that ousted now-deceased
 Muammar Qaddafi  as national leader this year, helping crude
futures in London rise to $127.02 a barrel in April. Libya’s
crude output will return to pre-conflict levels in the third
quarter of next year, the country’s oil minister said Dec. 14.  The following table shows weekly charters for crude cargoes
from Libya, according to Poten. Cargo size is expressed in
metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
