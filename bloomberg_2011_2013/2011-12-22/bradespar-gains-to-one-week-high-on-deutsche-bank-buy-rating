Bradespar SA , the investment arm of
 Banco Bradesco SA , rose to a one-week high after Deutsche Bank
Group AG rated the stock “buy,” citing valuation.  Shares advanced 1.6 percent to 32 reais at 4:06 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, the highest intraday price since Dec. 14.  The stock’s current price doesn’t reflect the value of the
company’s holdings, Deutsche Bank analysts Rodrigo Barros and
Leandro Cappa wrote in a research note today. Bradespar owns a
stake in  CPFL Energia SA ,  Brazil ’s largest private-sector power
distributor, and Valepar, a holding company that controls mining
group  Vale SA , according to Bradespar’s website.  “We see the current 14 percent discount to its net asset
value as excessive,” Barros and Cappa wrote.  Bradespar fell 26 percent this year, while Vale dropped 21
percent and CPFL gained 24 percent in the same period. Bradespar
has a price-to-book ratio of 1.3, near the lowest in three
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
