Nigerian bank stocks, headed for the
longest winning streak in nearly two years, have risen because
investors believe they are oversold, Dependable Securities
Limited said.  The  Bloomberg Banking Index (NGSEB10) , which tracks the performance
of the 10 most capitalized banks, rose a ninth day, its longest
winning streak since January 2010. The gauge added 1.6 percent
to 280.08 and traded lower at 278.53 at 1.33 p.m. in Lagos. A
close at this level will be the index’s highest since Nov. 23.  “The stocks have gotten to a level that investors can no
longer ignore them,” Chinenyem Anyanwu, chief executive officer
of Lagos-based Dependable Securities, said by phone today. The
banking index has fallen 30 percent this year compared with a 17
percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index (NGSEINDX) ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 threatened the Nigerian
banking system, prompting the central bank to fire eight chief
executives of the country’s 24 lenders and set up the Asset
Management Corp. of Nigeria, or Amcon, to buy bad debts and
stabilize the industry. Amcon has acquired 3.14 trillion naira
($19 billion) worth of debts, Chief Executive Officer Mustafa
Chike-Obi said Nov. 28.  Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) , which acquired  Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON) ,
one of the eight bailed-out lenders, declined 0.9 percent to
4.62 naira, while  First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) , which bought
 Finbank Plc (FIRSTINL) , lost 4.9 percent to 4.07 naira.  Skye Bank Plc (SKYEBANK) 
gained 1.6 percent to 4.38 naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
