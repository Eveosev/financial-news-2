Denmark’s economy contracted less
than previously estimated in the third quarter as the  trade
balance  was revised higher, the statistics agency said.  Gross domestic product  shrank 0.5 percent from the previous
quarter, compared with a prior estimate of a 0.8 percent
contraction, Copenhagen-based  Statistics Denmark  said today.
Exports advanced 0.5 percent compared with 0.4 percent in last
month’s report, while imports rose 0.9 percent compared with a
previous estimate of 1.3 percent.  The Nordic region’s weakest economy is grappling with
falling consumer spending caused by housing prices that have
dropped to a six year-low and a banking crisis that has led to
reduced lending. The statistics agency said today that private
consumption fell 0.5 percent in the quarter, more than the 0.3
percent estimated last month.  “On the surface, today’s numbers paint a less bleak
picture of the economy,” Tore Stramer, an economist at Nykredit
Markets in Copenhagen, said in a note. “We expect that the
economy will recover slightly in 2012. However, that requires a
gradual improvement of the pessimistic view that’s weighing on
the economy.”  Denmark’s consumer confidence index dropped to minus 9.8
this month, the lowest  since March 2009 , the agency said
yesterday.  The economy grew 0.1 percent in the third quarter compared
with the same period a year earlier, the agency said. That was
revised from a 0.2 percent contraction in the Nov. 30 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
