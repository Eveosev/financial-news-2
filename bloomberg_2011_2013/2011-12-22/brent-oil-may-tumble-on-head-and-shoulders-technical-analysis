Brent oil may decline by more than
$10 a barrel in  London  as prices complete a “head-and-
shoulders” pattern that could drag crude down to $96, according
to Stockholm-based SEB AB.  Brent crude  for February settlement on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange began the outline with the left-hand
“shoulder” in late October, the “head” in November, and then
a right-hand shoulder early this month, the bank said. Last
week, prices dropped below the “neck-line” at $105.82 a barrel
on Dec. 14, a signal to sell, according to the lender. Brent,
trading today near $108, may now decline to $96 as the shape is
completed, SEB predicts.  “This is an area where you should try to sell oil,”
Anders Soederberg, the bank’s chief technical analyst, said
today by telephone from  Stockholm . “We’re targeting $96 to $97
because of the head-and-shoulders pattern.”  A downward-sloping channel that has bound Brent since April
also suggests the commodity is poised for a drop, he said.  Conversely, a move back above the right-hand shoulder at
$111.33 a barrel would show that the head-and-shoulders
pattern’s influence has ended, Soederberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
