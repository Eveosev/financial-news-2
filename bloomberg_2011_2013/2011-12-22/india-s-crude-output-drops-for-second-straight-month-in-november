India ’s crude oil output declined
for the second straight month in November as production by  Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  and non-state companies dropped.  Asia ’s second-biggest energy consumer  pumped  3.1 million
metric tons of oil last month, 5.7 percent lower than a year
earlier, the oil ministry said in a statement today, without
providing reasons for the fall.  Production by state-owned ONGC, the nation’s largest energy
explorer, fell 4.2 percent to 1.9 million tons, the ministry
said. The company’s Mumbai High fields produced 1.3 million
tons, a decline of 5.3 percent. The fields, 100 miles (160
kilometers) northwest of Mumbai in the  Arabian Sea , account for
42 percent of India’s oil output.  Production by non-state explorers fell 11.7 percent to
833,200 tons. Output from offshore areas, where companies
including  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  and BG Group Plc operate,
declined 28 percent. In Rajasthan state, where  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) 
operates the country’s biggest onshore oil deposit, production
rose 0.1 percent to 524,700 tons, according to the data. Cairn
India started the field in August 2009.  Oil India Ltd., the second-biggest state-run crude
producer, reported a 3.3 percent increase in output to 311,200
tons, according to the statement.  Natural  gas output  in the country fell for the 12th
straight month, declining 10 percent to 3.8 billion cubic
meters, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
