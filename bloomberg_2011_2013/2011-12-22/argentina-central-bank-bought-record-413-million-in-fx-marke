Argentina ’s central bank bought a
record $413 million in the foreign exchange market today,
exceeding the $278 million that it bought yesterday, said an
official at the institution who declined to be identified
because he isn’t authorized to speak publicly.  Argentine grain exporters and insurance companies are
bringing more dollars to the country at a time when companies
buy more pesos ahead of the holidays, during which they pay
worker bonuses, said the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
