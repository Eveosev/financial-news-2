Ukraine’s government prepared the
2012 state budget draft for a second reading in parliament at a
special meeting yesterday, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The government lowered its forecast for export growth nest
year to 6.3 percent from 9.2 percent, the Kiev-based ministry
said in a statement e-mailed late yesterday. The forecast for
import growth was lowered to 6.4 percent from 13.3 percent.  Ukraine’s state debt next year will account for 28.4
percent of gross domestic product and will decline in 2013 to
25.3 percent and to 24.3 percent in 2014, the ministry said.  The Cabinet calculated economic growth next year at 3.9
