Pink Floyd , U2, Nirvana, the Rolling
Stones and Tony Bennett have the ideal Christmas box for fans.  Each offers hours of music -- at a heavy holiday price.  Some artists are releasing their entire oeuvre in one box.  Leonard Cohen anthologizes excellently on “The Complete
Columbia Albums Collection” ( 18  discs, $140, Sony), a nostalgic
treat for those who haven’t heard those LPs in years. Check the
nicely downbeat titles: “Songs From a Room,” “Recent Songs.”  Boxes of  Robert Johnson  ( 17  discs, $350, Columbia) and
 Aretha Franklin  ( 12  discs, $130, Legacy) capture some of the
most emotional blues, gospel and soul of all time.  “The Complete Smiths” ( eight  discs, about $200, Rhino) is
remastered from original tapes of the U.K. band. While this set
misses some single medleys and mixes, it’s still exceptional.  Billy Joel’s “Complete Albums Collection” ( 15  discs for
$199, Columbia) is spotty. He’s better served by the Legacy
reissue of the classic “Piano Man.”  Only a  Tony Bennett  maniac would want him warbling 1,000
songs for a solid three days, including some dreadful Las Vegas
casino numbers. “The Complete Collection” ($400, or $500
signed, RPM Legacy) is at least good value for each of its  76 
discs.  Bennett’s life-work set comes at age 85; Wynton Marsalis’s
likeable “Swinging Into the 21st” ( 11  discs, $80, Columbia)
comes at 50; Sting’s excellent “25 Years” ( four  discs, $120,
A&M) was released at age 60.  Rufus Wainwright, at 38, couldn’t wait that long for his
“House of Rufus” ( 19  discs, $360, 101 Distribution), which
shows he’s talented, prolific and needs a good editor.  The Grateful Dead’s “Europe ‘72: The Complete Recordings”
( 73  discs, about $800, Rhino) will leave rich Deadheads in
seventh heaven. Me, I’d prefer “Live Dead” or “Grayfolded,”
which restrict the band’s best concert showing to two discs.  Some of  Phil Spector ’s finest “little symphonies for
kids” are on “The Philles Album Collection” ( seven  discs,
$70, Legacy). The originals by the Crystals, Ronettes and Bob B.
Soxx & the Blue Jeans are 1960s pop gold, though overshadowed by
the “Back to Mono” set and Spector’s 2009 murder conviction.
“The Essential Phil Spector” is a snappy, cheaper alternative.  Pink Floyd’s heavyweight contender is “The Discovery Box
Set” ( 16  CDs, $180, EMI). Those wanting more can spend another
$120 apiece on the “Immersion” editions of “Wish You Were
Here” and “The Dark Side of the Moon,” which come with
pointless Floyd marbles and scarves. Much neater are the two-CD
“Experience” versions for $20 each.  The biggest version of U2’s “Achtung Baby” has a copy of
Bono’s Fly sunglasses and spreads the 20-year-old LP over  14 
discs, with outtakes, rehearsals, videos and the follow-up
“Zooropa” for $440. The slimmed-down 10-disc set is $130 and
highly recommended. There’s a two-CD version too.  Nirvana’s 20th-anniversary edition of “Nevermind” ( five 
discs, $120, Geffen) and “Some Girls” by the  Rolling Stones 
( three  discs, $143, Hip-O) will be too much for the average
listener. Nirvana’s CD changed the course of rock, though the
rehearsals and outtakes are ragged; the Stones LP, which
includes “Miss You,” works fine as a slim, two-CD version.  Studio geeks will love the Beach Boys’ “Smile” ( nine 
discs, $140, Capitol); their families will be driven crazy over
Christmas with more than 30 takes of “Good Vibrations.” Primal
Scream’s “Screamadelica” 20th-anniversary set ( seven  discs,
$190, Sony U.K.) has more variety. Buy it for the 14 remixes,
not the limited edition T-shirt. Two-CD versions are available.  Elvis Costello ’s “The Return of the Spectacular Spinning
Songbook” ( three  discs and book, $250, Hip-O) commemorates his
lively Los Angeles concerts this year. The contrarian star has
been telling fans not to buy it and instead try Louis Armstrong’s “Ambassador of Jazz” ( 10  discs, $150, Universal).
He might add “Live in Europe 1967” by  Miles Davis  ( four  discs,
$35, Legacy) or  Jimi Hendrix ’s “Winterland” ( four  discs, $50,
Experience Hendrix), which both feature instrumental virtuosity.  This year had a bumper crop of deluxe versions of many rock
classics -- all about $20, a fraction of the price of their
weighty box-set brothers.  The best include “Songs in A Minor: 10th Anniversary” by
 Alicia Keys , “Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs” by Derek
and the Dominos,  George Michael ’s “Faith,” the Jesus and Mary
Chain’s “Psychocandy,” Pearl Jam’s “vs. and Vitalogy,” and
Suede’s albums. Reissues of Queen’s output and the Who’s
“Quadrophenia” were triumphs of packaging over inconsistent
music varying from the peerless to pretentious.  Many box sets are manufactured in limited quantities, so
prices are approximate and vary among retailers and online
sellers. Download prices also differ across services.  (Mark Beech writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
