Mortgage rates  for 30-year U.S.
loans dropped to the lowest level on record amid signs the
housing market may be set for a turnaround.  The average rate for a  30-year  fixed loan fell to 3.91
percent in the week ended today, the lowest in data dating to
1971, from 3.94 percent,  Freddie Mac  said in a statement. The
average  15-year  rate matched last week’s previous all-time low
of 3.21 percent, according to the McLean, Virginia-based
mortgage-finance company.  The U.S. housing market, under pressure from tight lending
standards and foreclosures that depress  values , is showing signs
of improvement. Purchases of previously owned homes rose to a
10-month high in November as the inventory of unsold properties
shrank to the lowest level in six years, the National
Association of Realtors reported yesterday.  “Falling home prices meeting already low  interest rates 
are driving affordability,” said Ellen Zentner, a senior U.S.
economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. in  New York .
“Mix that with higher consumer confidence and job growth, and I
can see why home sales appear to be lifting off the bottom.”  The U.S. property market still may fall further and not
rebound until late 2012 or early 2013, when gains probably won’t
match those seen before the housing boom ended in 2006,
according to a survey of 109 economists released this week by
Seattle-based Zillow Inc.  Unemployment Claims Decline  The number of Americans filing  claims  for  unemployment
benefits  decreased last week to the lowest level since April
2008, the Labor Department said today. November’s unemployment
rate was 8.6 percent, the lowest since March 2009.  Existing-home  sales  climbed 4 percent in November from the
previous month to a 4.42 million annual pace, the highest level
since January, according to the Realtors. The number of
previously owned houses on the market dropped to 2.58 million
last month, the fewest since May 2005, the group said.  U.S. home-loan applications declined in the week ended Dec.
16, according to the  Mortgage Bankers Association . The
Washington-based group’s index of  purchases  fell 4.9 percent,
while its measure of  refinancing  dropped 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
