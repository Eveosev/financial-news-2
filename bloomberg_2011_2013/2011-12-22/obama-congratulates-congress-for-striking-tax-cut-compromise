     Dec. 22 (Bloomberg) --President  Barack Obama  offered
congratulations to congressional leader for striking a last-
minute deal to avoid a payroll tax increase on Jan. 1.  “Because of this agreement, every working American will
keep his or her  tax cut  -- about $1,000 for the average
family,” Obama said in a written statement.  Obama said that when Congress returns from its holiday
break lawmakers should “keep working to reach an agreement that
will extend this tax cut and unemployment insurance for all of
2012 without drama or delay.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
