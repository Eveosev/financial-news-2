OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s state-run gas
export monopoly, plans to back billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s
plan to build a fuel-efficient car called the Yo-Mobile,
Interfax reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Alexey Miller.  “We’re going to help promote the project on the market,”
Miller was cited as saying. “It’s really original. It’s a new
word. For Gazprom, it’s an interesting way to develop gas-engine
fuel,” the Moscow-based news service cited him as saying at a
presentation of the car held at a Gazprom office today.  Gazprom plans to become the vehicle’s main sponsor, and the
contract, when signed, “would correspond to the scale of the
idea,” Miller said, Interfax reported.  Andrei Biryukov, director of carmaker  Yo-Auto , said the
company planned to have the vehicle participate in races
including the Dakar Rally, the news service reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
