The U.K.’s consumption of fuels such
as gasoline and jet fuel fell 2.3 percent in the third quarter
compared with a year earlier, according to the Department of
Energy and Climate Change.  Jet fuel  demand declined 5.8 percent to 3 million metric
tons, the department  said  today in an e-mailed statement.
Gasoline use dropped 5.5 percent to 3.5 million tons, it said.  The U.K. was a net importer of crude and oil products by
8.3 million tons compared with 4.9 million tons in the third
quarter of 2010, the department said.  Crude production decreased 23 percent to 11 million tons,
or about 883,600 barrels a day, because of maintenance and
“other production issues,” the department said. Refinery
processing increased 2.3 percent to 19.3 million tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
