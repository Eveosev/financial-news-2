China’s stocks  fell for a fourth day
as investors speculated  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen and
lending to small companies may drop as banks hoard cash to meet
year-end reserve-ratio requirements.  China Cosco Holdings Co., the nation’s largest shipping
Line, dropped to a record low as Europe’s lenders sought to
borrow more cash from the  European Central Bank  than economists
had expected, increasing concern the crisis won’t be contained.

prospect slumping trading volumes will curb profit growth. Focus
Technology Co. and Anhui Gujing Distillery Co. led a gauge of
small-company stocks lower as money market rates jumped.  “There’s no confidence in the market and the worry is
focused on the economic slowdown and a poor export outlook,”

doesn’t have many tools to bolster growth now as debt levels are
now higher than a couple of years ago.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 4.85 points, or 0.2
percent, to 2,186.30 at the close, the lowest in a week. The

that began tracking the multiple in 2006.  The  CSI 300 (SHSZ300)  added 0.1 percent to 2,341.33 as coal producers

to 3,298, the lowest level since September 2009. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, slid 1.5 percent at the close in  New York .  Commodities Fall  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 6.3 percent in December,
adding to a 22 percent slump this year, after the central bank
raised  interest rates  three times to cool inflation and exports
to Europe slowed because of the region’s debt crisis.  Trading volume of stocks in the index is 27 percent less
than the 180-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Citic Securities, which announced yesterday it
completed the sale of 51 percent stake in  China  Asset Management
Co., fell 1.4 percent to 9.83 yuan. Haitong Securities Co. slid
2.4 percent to 7.34 yuan.  In Europe, a total of 523 euro-area banks took a record 489
billion euros ($639 billion) from the ECB in three-year loans

will curb demand for metals. Shandong Gold Mining Co. slid 1.7
percent to 28.89 yuan.  Taiyuan Heavy Industry Co. (600169)  paced declines for industrial
stocks, falling 1.8 percent to 5.02 yuan. Jing Ulrich, chairman
of global markets for China at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said Dec.
19 that she is bearish on “cyclical” stocks such as heavy
industries.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, rose 17 basis points, or
0.17 percentage point, to 3.77 percent today in Shanghai,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  “It’s the year-end effect,”  Ju Wang , a Singapore-based
senior strategist at  Barclays Capital , said yesterday. “Demand
for cash will increase as people prepare for the Chinese
holidays and this will tighten liquidity.”  Smallcaps Slump  The  CSI smallcap gauge (SH000905)  has tumbled 33 percent this year.

today, adding to a 33 percent slide in 2011. Anhui Gujing, which

public holidays. Chinese New Year starts on Jan. 23.  China should boost loans to small companies, the Financial
News wrote in a front-page commentary today. The country should
increase lending for agriculture, affordable housing
construction and strategic emerging industries, according to the
publication by the People’s Bank of China.  The central bank last month lowered the lenders’ reserve
requirement ratio for the first time since 2008. The central
bank had boosted the ratio to a record high to prevent excess
lending from creating asset bubbles.  More Chinese bankers are forecasting a further loosening in
monetary policy as economic growth slows, and inflation
expectations of households are easing, surveys by the central
bank showed today.  Policy Outlook  About 14.4 percent of bankers expect more monetary policy
easing, compared with 3.5 percent in last quarter’s survey.
About 56 percent predict the current policy bias will be
maintained, while the rest foresee a tightening, the central
bank said. Among households, 36.8 percent forecast prices will
rise in the next three months, compared with almost half in the
previous survey.  The government may relax enforcement of property curbs by
the second quarter, Andy Rothman, China macro strategist at CLSA
Asia-Pacific Markets, said in an interview in  Shanghai .  While  China’s economy  may grow 8.5 percent next year, it
may still introduce “modest” fiscal stimulus to offset rising
unemployment in export-oriented regions such as southern
 Guangdong province , he said. The measures will target the water,
power transmission and low-income housing industries, he said.  China Vanke Co., the biggest Chinese developer, gained 1.6
percent to 7.42 yuan, while Poly Real Estate Group. added 1.6
percent to 10.07 yuan.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
