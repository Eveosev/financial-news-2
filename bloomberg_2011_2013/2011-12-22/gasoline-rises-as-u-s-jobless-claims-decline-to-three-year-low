Gasoline futures rose after the U.S.
said the number of unemployment claims unexpectedly dropped last
week, signaling a strengthening economy.  Prices advanced for a fourth day after the Labor Department
reported that  jobless  claims fell by 4,000 to 364,000 in the
week ended Dec. 17, the fewest since April 2008. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast an increase to 380,000.  Consumer
confidence  in the U.S. increased to a five-month high last week.  “The market is encouraged by the decrease in unemployment
claims,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  Gasoline for January delivery rose 1.99 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.6398 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures are up 7.6 percent this year
after gaining 20 percent last year and doubling in 2009.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index climbed to minus 45 in
the period ended Dec. 18 from a reading of minus 49.9 the prior
week. It’s the highest level since July.  January-delivery heating oil slipped 0.11 cent to $2.9076 a
gallon, paring the gain this year to 14 percent.  February crude oil rose 86 cents to $99.53 a barrel on the
Nymex.  Oil is also rising on political tension in  Iraq , Lipow
said. Bombings across  Baghdad  killed 57 people overnight amid
political infighting that has followed the withdrawal of U.S.
troops from the country.  “Iraq makes the market nervous,” Lipow said. “The
increase in sectarian violence could threaten oil production.”  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1
cent to $3.216 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices
are 7.3 percent higher than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
