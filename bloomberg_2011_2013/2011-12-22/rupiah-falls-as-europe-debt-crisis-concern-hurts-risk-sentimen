Indonesia’s rupiah fell the most in
more than three weeks as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will
worsen sapped demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency extended the week’s loss as the  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia-
Pacific Index of shares snapped two days of gains. The rupiah
has lost 1.5 percent this year and is headed for its first
annual decline since 2008. Euro-area lenders sought more cash
from the  European Central Bank  than economists had expected,
reducing optimism the region’s debt crisis will be contained.  “There’s a risk-off mood today and stocks and regional
currencies were sold,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the
Japan Center for Economic Research in  Tokyo . “The rupiah may
stay under pressure toward year-end.”  The rupiah dropped 0.9 percent, the most since Nov. 28, to
9,150 per dollar as of 3:02 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency may fall
toward 9,250 by the end of the year, Hayashi said.  Foreign ownership  of  Indonesia ’s government debt stood at
221.8 trillion rupiah ($24.3 billion) as of Dec. 20, down from
224.3 trillion rupiah a week ago, according to data from the
ministry of finance.  Euro-area banks need to refinance more than 600 billion
euros ($786 billion) of debt maturing next year, about three-
quarters of which is unsecured, the Bank of England said in its
financial stability report this month. That’s 35 percent more
than in 2011, the bank said. The ECB awarded 489 billion euros
in 1,134-day loans to lenders yesterday, more than economists’
median estimate of 293 billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey.  The yield on Indonesia’s 8.25 percent bonds due July 2021
declined 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.04
percent, according to midday prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
