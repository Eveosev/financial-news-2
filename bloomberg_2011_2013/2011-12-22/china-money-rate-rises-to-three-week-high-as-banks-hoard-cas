China ’s money-market rate rose to a
three-week high on speculation banks will hoard cash to meet
year-end  capital requirements  and customer withdrawals.  Money supply also waned as the central bank took out a net
10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) from the financial system this
week, a fourth week it has drained funds, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. China’s financial markets will close on
Jan. 2-3, while the week-long Lunar New Year holiday starts Jan.
23.  “Banks are worried about liquidity supply during the
holiday season,” said Guo Caomin, a fixed-income analyst at
Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai. “They are reluctant to lend to
each other.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 17 basis points to 3.77 percent as
of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched
3.79 percent, the highest level since Dec. 2.  The central bank kept the yield on three-month bills
unchanged at 3.1618 percent for a 17th straight auction,
according to a statement on its website.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was unchanged at
2.79 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.99 percent government bonds due June
2021 was unchanged at 3.48 percent, according to quotes provided
by the Interbank Funding Center.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
