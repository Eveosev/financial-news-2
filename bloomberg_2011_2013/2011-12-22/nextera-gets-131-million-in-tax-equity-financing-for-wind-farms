A  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  unit raised
$131 million in tax-equity financing from  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
for three California wind farms.  In addition to the financing announced today, Nextera’s
Golden Winds LLC expects to receive an additional $78 million
from JPMorgan in early 2012, the Juno Beach, Florida-based power
producer said in a statement. The projects have a total capacity
of 205.9 megawatts.  Taking a stake in the wind farms entitles JPMorgan to apply
a share of the projects’ tax credits to its own tax bill. They
will enter operation this month or next, Steve Stengel, a
NextEra spokesman, said today in an e-mail.  Golden Winds owns the 78.2-megawatt Montezuma II project in
Solano County, the 78.2-megawatt Vasco wind farm in Contra Costa
County and the 49.5-megawatt San  Georgia  project in Riverside
County, according to a NextEra Dec. 6  filing  with the U.S.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  PG&E Corp.’s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. utility will buy
the output from Montezuma and Vasco. San Georgia has “several
long-term power purchase agreements,” NextEra said in the
filing, without naming the buyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
