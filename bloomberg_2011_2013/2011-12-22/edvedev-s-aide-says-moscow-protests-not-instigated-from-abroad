Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s
chief economy aide, Arkady Dvorkovich, said protests against the
results of a parliamentary election this month weren’t
instigated by forces outside the country.  Speaking after Medvedev’s last state-of-the-nation address,
Dvorkovich added that proposals to loosen political controls
made by the president today weren’t strongly influenced by the
rallies, the country’s biggest in more than a decade.  “We are talking about decisions that involve the interests
of millions of people, not 1,000 or 50,000, even though what
those 50,000 people say reflects the interests of many others,”
Dvorkovich said. “Rallies are just a signal, while the
president focuses on the mood of the entire society.”  A Dec. 10 demonstration on Bolotnaya Square in central
Moscow gathered at least 25,000 protesters. Opposition leaders
are planning a new rally in the capital this weekend and
received permission for 50,000 people to attend. Medvedev today
said “we won’t allow interference from abroad into our domestic
affairs” even as people have the right to express their
opinion.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  has said foreign funding was
helping fuel protests that were organized to destabilize  Russia .
U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton ’s criticism of the vote
emboldened the opposition and “sent a signal” to activists,
Putin said Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
