Brevan Howard  Asset Management LLP,
the hedge fund founded by  Alan Howard , paid its partners as much
as 128.3 million pounds ($201.3 million) in the 12 months ending
in March, a 79 percent drop from a year earlier as fees plunged.  Fees fell to 236.8 million pounds from 736.3 million
pounds, according to a Brevan Howard filing posted today at the
U.K.’s Companies House. The London-based company’s biggest hedge
fund, the Brevan Howard Master Fund, had an investment gain of 1
percent in 2010, down from a 19 percent return in 2009,
according to investors. Brevan Howard generates fees based on
fund performance and assets under management.  The $27 billion Master fund had its worst year in 2010
after betting that slowing growth would weaken the euro currency
and prompt investors to seek a safe haven in U.S. Treasuries,
according to a report sent to clients. Brevan Howard’s bearish
view has been proven right this year, leading to a 12.6 percent
gain for the Master fund in the 11 months through November.  Hedge funds have had their second-worst year ever in 2011,
falling  4.4 percent  on average amid market volatility stemming
from the European sovereign debt crisis, according to Chicago-
based Hedge Fund Research Inc. The industry lost a record 19
percent in 2008.  Most Pay  The average number of Brevan Howard partners for the year
ending in March was 52, according to today’s filing. The
highest-paid partner received 64.8 million pounds, compared with
267.3 million pounds in the year earlier period, the filing
said. The filing didn’t disclose how much pay Howard, 48,
received. Executives at the firm declined to comment.  Brevan Howard oversees $33 billion in six hedge funds,
including a credit fund, an emerging markets fund, a commodities
fund and a pool focused on Asian investments. In October, Brevan
Howard said it would return about $2 billion of capital to
Master fund investors to keep the fund’s assets at $25 billion.  Howard founded the company in 2002 with four other traders
from Credit Suisse Group AG’s proprietary fixed-income trading
desk. James Vernon, the chief operating officer who represented
the “V” in Brevan Howard’s name, left the firm in September.
Jean-Philippe Blochet, who represented the “B,” departed the
company in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
