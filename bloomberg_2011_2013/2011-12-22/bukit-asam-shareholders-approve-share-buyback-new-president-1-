PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (PTBA) 
shareholders approved a plan to buy back as much as 2 trillion
rupiah ($218 million) of shares, said Milawarma, whose
appointment as president director was also approved today.  Bukit Asam, a Tanjung Enim, South Sumatra-based coal
producer, expects sales next year to rise to 18 million metric
tons while output may increase to 16 million tons, Milawarma
said in Jakarta without providing comparative figures.  Milawarma, operations and production director, will replace
outgoing president director Sukrisno. Shareholders also named
Achmad Sudarto as finance director.  Bukit Asam may spend 1.7 trillion rupiah in capital
expenditure next year, Milawarma said. The company and its
partner  Lanco Infratech Ltd. (LANCI)  will build a power plant in Riau
with capacity of 600 megawatts, at a cost of 1 trillion rupiah
to 1.2 trillion rupiah, Milawarma said. Bukit Asam may own take
a 51 percent stake in the venture, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
