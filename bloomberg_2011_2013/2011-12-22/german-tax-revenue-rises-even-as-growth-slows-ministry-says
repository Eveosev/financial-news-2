German  tax revenue  jumped in
November, suggesting the federal and regional governments may
beat their full-year targets even as economic growth slows,
figures published by the  Finance Ministry  showed.  Tax income rose 7.6 percent from a year earlier to 37.8
billion euros ($49.3 billion), the Berlin-based ministry said in
its monthly report today. Tax collection in the first 11 months
increased 8.5 percent, which compares to a growth target for the
full year of 7.5 percent, the ministry said.  “The economic upswing in  Germany  has clearly lost momentum
most recently,” the ministry said. Forward-looking indicators
suggest that the country faces “a temporary economic weakening
that will be followed by dynamic economic development in the
summer months.”  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s federal government reduced
planned bond sales next year to 250 billion euros, compared with
the 270 billion euros slated in the budget and 283 billion euros
sold this year, the Frankfurt-based Federal Finance Agency said
yesterday in presenting its provisional calendar for 2012.  The German economy will probably avoid a recession even as
demand for German exports cools, two institutes that advise the
government said Dec. 20. Kiel-based IfW said economic growth
will slow to 0.5 percent in 2012 from 2.9 percent this year,
while the RWI in Essen said in a separate report that the
expansion will decelerate to 0.6 percent from 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
