Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) , operator
of a server network that lets businesses speed data delivery,
rose the most in more than 19 months after agreeing to buy
startup competitor Cotendo Inc. for about $268 million in cash.  Akamai jumped 19 percent to $31.63 today in Nasdaq trading,
its biggest one-day gain since April 29, 2010.  The acquisition will let Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
Akamai expand its acceleration technologies for the Web-based
cloud computing system used by customers such as phone companies
and social networks. The deal also helps Akamai “maintain its
leadership position and high margins” by eliminating a
competitor, according to a research note from  Gray Powell , an
analyst at  Wells Fargo & Co . in  New York .  Akamai is paying about nine times Cotendo’s anticipated
2011 revenue of $30 million, according to Powell. The ratio
makes the deal “expensive but worth it,” he said. The purchase
price is less than the $300 million some investors had expected
three weeks ago, said Powell, who rates the stock
“outperform.”  Investors in Cotendo, founded in 2008, include venture-
capital firms Sequoia Capital and Benchmark Capital, as well as
 Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) , according to the startup’s  website .
Sunnyvale, California-based Cotendo has about 100 employees,
half of them in Israel, where the company has a technology
center, according to a statement today.  The purchase is Akamai’s second largest after the $2.19
billion acquisition of InterVU Inc. in 2000, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Akamai has a market value of $5.68
billion and about 2,300 employees. It has declined 33 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
