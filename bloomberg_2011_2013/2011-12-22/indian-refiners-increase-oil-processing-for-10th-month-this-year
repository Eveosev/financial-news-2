Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  and  Bharat
Petroleum Corp. (BPCL)  led refiners in boosting the country’s crude
processing in November for the 10th month this year.  Refiners turned 14.4 million metric tons of crude into
fuels, 11 percent higher than a year earlier, the oil ministry
said in a statement in  New Delhi  today.  Processing  by Reliance, operator of the world’s biggest
refining complex, rose 40 percent to 2.9 million tons. The
company didn’t provide data for its newer, 29 million ton-a-year
refinery, according to the ministry. State-run Bharat Petroleum
increased output 20 percent to 2 million tons.  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL) , the nation’s largest refiner, raised
processing by 6.1 percent to 4.7 million tons after its plant at
Panipat in the northern state of Haryana increased production by
20 percent. Hindustan Petroleum Corp., based in Mumbai, raised
output 2.8 percent to 1.4 million tons.  Reliance’s smaller non-state rival,  Essar Oil Ltd. (ESOIL) ,
