OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s largest
producer of coal for steelmaking, fell in U.S. trading after
Moody’s Investors Service cut the outlook on the company’s debt
to “negative” from “stable.”  American depositary receipts declined 0.7 percent to $8.29
at 12:31 p.m. in New York. The stock is down 72 percent this
year.  Chief Financial Officer Stanislav Ploschenko said on Dec.
15 that  Mechel (MTLR)  may renegotiate debt covenants with lenders if
the ratio of its net debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization exceeds 3.5 this year. Moody’s
rates the debt B1, four steps below investment grade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
