Arsenal has postponed its Premier
League soccer match against  Wolverhampton Wanderers  by 24 hours
to Dec. 27 because of a strike by London Underground workers.  London Underground Ltd. today failed in a court bid to stop
the action by train drivers from the Associated Society of
Locomotive Engineers and Firemen union. ASLEF plans strikes on
four days over holiday pay, including the day after Christmas.  Arsenal’s match will now be played at 3 p.m. local time on
Dec. 27.  “The paramount concern was always the duty of care towards
the Arsenal supporters, Wolverhampton Wanderers supporters,
matchday employees and workers and indeed everyone who was
planning to attend the match on Boxing Day,” Arsenal said in a
 statement  on the club’s website.  The Gunners beat Aston Villa 2-1 yesterday to remain in
contention for the top four finish they need to qualify for next
season’s  Champions League . Arsenal is behind fourth-place
Chelsea on goal difference.  Chelsea said yesterday that its game against Fulham on Dec.
26 will go ahead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
