Yuan forwards weakened as Chinese
households’ inflation expectations declined and the  European
Central Bank  pledged to lend a record amount to euro-area banks,
fueling concerns over the region’s debt crisis.  About 37 percent of households surveyed expect prices to
rise over the next quarter, down from 49.6 percent in September,
and 20.8 percent predict property prices will fall, the People’s
Bank of China said on its website today. The Frankfurt-based ECB
awarded a record 489 billion euros ($640 billion) in loans for
three years yesterday.  “Easing inflation pressure and concerns over  Europe ’s debt
crisis will slow the pace of yuan appreciation,” said Edmond Law, deputy head of foreign-exchange at BWC Capital Markets in
Hong Kong. “However, it’s unlikely for China to allow yuan
depreciation as the PBOC has reiterated its determination to
improve exchange-rate policy.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.13 percent to
6.3900 per dollar as of 4:39 p.m. in  Hong Kong . The contracts
traded at a 0.8 percent discount to the onshore spot rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan closed at 6.3390 per dollar in  Shanghai , little
changed from yesterday’s 6.3387, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The People’s Bank of China set the
 reference rate  0.01 percent weaker at 6.3253. The currency is
allowed to trade 0.5 percent on either side of the daily fixing.
In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.03 percent to
6.3470.  The People’s Bank of China will continue pushing forward
reform of its exchange-rate mechanism and interest-rate
liberalization, the central bank said in a statement posted on
its website yesterday.  China  will continue with a prudent
monetary policy stance in 2012, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
