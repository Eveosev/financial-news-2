Gold declined in  New York  for the
third time in four days on signs of a strengthening U.S. job
market and a drop in holdings by  exchange-traded fund  investors.  Applications for  unemployment benefits  unexpectedly  dropped 
last week to the lowest since April 2008, the government
reported today, boosting the dollar and reducing demand for gold
as an alternative asset. Holdings in bullion-backed ETFs fell
for a fifth day to the lowest level since Nov. 16, as investors
sold the metal to cover losses in other markets, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  “The jobless numbers were better than expected, and we’re
seeing the dollar strengthen again,” Dennis Cajigas, a senior
market strategist at Zaner Group in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “The  U.S. economy  is starting to find some traction.
The ETF numbers are also a factor.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,610.60 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal has climbed 13 percent this year. Prices dropped
6.9 percent last week after the  Federal Reserve  refrained from
taking new action to boost economic growth.  Bullion-backed ETF holdings, which reached an all-time high
of 2,360.81 metric tons on Dec. 14, fell to 2,329.921 tons
yesterday.  Silver futures for March retreated 0.7 percent $29.047 an
ounce on the Comex, extending this year’s decline to 6.1
percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
March delivery jumped 3.2 percent, the most since Dec. 6, to
$654.40 an ounce. Platinum futures for January delivery fell 0.5
percent to $1,431.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
