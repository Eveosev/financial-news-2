Bank UralSib  of  Russia  obtained a
$132 million trade-finance loan, according to a statement from
the lenders.  The one-year facility was increased from an initial size of
$100 million and pays interest of 225 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate, according to the statement, dated
yesterday.  Commerzbank AG, ING Groep NV, Raiffeisen Bank International
AG and VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG arranged the financing,
according to the statement. They were joined by six other
lenders including Citigroup Inc. and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc.  Standard & Poor’s  raised UralSib’s credit rating by one
level to BB- on Dec. 9, and cited the lender’s “weak capital
and earnings” and “moderate systemic importance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
