U.S. Gulf oil premiums weakened as
the difference between West Texas Intermediate and Brent
narrowed a fourth consecutive day.  The spread between the two benchmark crude futures for
February delivery decreased 68 cents to settle at $8.36 a barrel
in  New York  today. The differential has narrowed 70 percent
since reaching a record of $27.88 a barrel Oct. 14.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI narrowed 50 cents to
$9 a barrel at 4:17 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet  narrowed $1 to $8.50 over
the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI lost $1.25 to $6.60. The
premium for Mars Blend slipped 20 cents to $5.50 a barrel, the
smallest since March.  Poseidon ’s premium weakened 70 cents to
$4.90 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium decreased $1.25 to $4.05 a
barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount widened 45 cents to $1.35
cents under WTI.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  was unchanged at
$15.75 a barrel.  Syncrude ’s premium was unchanged at $2.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
