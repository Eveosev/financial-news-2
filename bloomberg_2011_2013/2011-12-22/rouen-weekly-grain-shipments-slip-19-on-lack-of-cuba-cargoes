Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 19 percent
in the week ended yesterday as deliveries to Cuba and sub-
Saharan  Africa  weren’t repeated.  Outbound grain amounted to 160,573 metric tons from Dec. 15
to Dec. 21, compared with 199,407 tons a week earlier, the  Seine
River port  said in an e-mailed report today. Export cargoes
included 149,383 tons of wheat.  Morocco accounted for the bulk of shipments, taking 145,938
tons of wheat, compared with 57,330 tons the previous week, as
well as 5,040 tons of barley. Last week’s shipments included
48,902 tons of wheat for Cuba, compared with none in the most
recent seven-day period.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to data from national
crops office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
