Britain’s antitrust regulator said
it doesn’t have enough evidence to pursue a criminal probe of
individuals allegedly involved in a cartel in the truck
manufacturing industry, including a  Daimler AG (DAI)  executive.  The criminal case, started in September 2010, was dropped
yesterday by the  Office of Fair Trading  following a “thorough
investigation,” the watchdog said on its  website . The OFT,
which investigates and prosecutes competition violations, is
continuing a civil probe of the companies, including Daimler’s
U.K. Mercedes-Benz unit,  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  and at least three other truck
makers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
