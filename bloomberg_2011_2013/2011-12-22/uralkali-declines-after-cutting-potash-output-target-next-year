OAO Uralkali (URKA) ,  Russia â€™s biggest
fertilizer maker, declined the most in more than a week in
Moscow after cutting its output target for next year by at least
7 percent.  Uralkali shares fell as much as 3.8 percent, the biggest
drop since Dec. 13, and traded down 3.5 percent at 228.93 rubles
at 12:38 p.m. in Moscow, while the 30-stock Micex Index gained
0.1 percent to 1,386.30.  Production next year may reach 10.5 million to 11 million
metric tons, down from a Dec. 7 estimate of as much as 11.8
million tons, Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner said
in an interview on Bloomberg Television late yesterday. The
company is seeking to support potash prices after Brazilian
clients delayed some purchases after a price increase announced
in September.  Uralkali shares have gained 8 percent this year as potash
prices increased, while the Micex has fallen 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
