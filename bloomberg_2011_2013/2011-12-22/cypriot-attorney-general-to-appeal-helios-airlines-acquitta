Cyprus’s attorney general Petros
Clerides said he will file an appeal against the acquittal of
Helios Airlines Ltd. and four of its directors and managers
related to a 2005 crash.  “Filing an appeal against the ruling is justified,”
Clerides told reporters in Nicosia today. The appeal will be
submitted to the east Mediterranean island’s  Supreme Court 
within two weeks, he added.  All 115 passengers and six crew members onboard the Helios
flight 522 died when their plane crashed north of Athens on
August 14, 2005. Relatives of the dead gathered outside
Clerides’s  office  today. The Cypriot airline, which suspended
its operations in November 2006, and the other defendants were
acquitted of a total of 1,190 charges related to manslaughter
for failing to ensure the airplane was flown by qualified
pilots, according to a copy of the verdict obtained by
Bloomberg.  “We conclude without any reservation that in all charges
no case against the defendants has been proven,” Harris
Solomonides and Nicos Yiapanas, two of the three judges at the
Nicosia Assize Court said in the verdict. The third judge
accepted the evidence for the prosecution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
