Banco Panamericano SA , the Brazilian
lender bailed out after allegations of accounting fraud,
suspended payments of four local bonds after it was granted an
injunction from a  Sao Paulo  state court.  The Sao Paulo-based bank said today in a regulatory filing
that it filed a lawsuit against bondholders on Dec. 19 to get
the injunction to withhold payments because the securities have
“atypical” rates and maturities. The court’s decision issued
on Dec. 20 affects payment of certain private bonds, known as
certificados de depositos bancario, that were issued in 2005,
2006 and 2008.  Panamericano, which is controlled by Banco BTG Pactual SA
and Caixa Economica Federal, said in the filing that it’s
“fully able to pay the bonds, which are properly accounted
for” on its financial statement. The bonds can’t be resold by
holders, according to the filing.  The lender’s former controlling shareholder, Grupo  Silvio Santos , had to borrow 2.5 billion reais ($1.35 billion) in
November 2010 from the nation’s bank deposits insurance fund, or
FGC, after allegations of accounting fraud arose. BTG Pactual
bought Silvio Santos’s stake in the bank in February, assuming
3.8 billion reais in debt.  Valor Economico  reported yesterday that Panamericano won
the injunction to withhold payment of 21 million reais of
private bonds suspected of being part of a fraud.  To contact the reporters on this story:
