Williams Partners LP (WPZ)  agreed to buy
pipelines connected to  Pennsylvania  and New York natural-gas
wells from Delphi Midstream Partners LLC for about $750 million
in cash and stock, adding capacity where production is rising.  Delphi, owned by American Securities LLC and its management,
will get $300 million in cash and about 7.5 million common units
in exchange for its Laser Gathering System, Tulsa, Oklahoma-
based Williams Partners said in a statement today.  The purchase includes 33 miles (53 kilometers) of pipeline
and related equipment in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, and
10 miles in New York, said Williams Partners, a master limited
partnership controlled by Williams Cos. The partnership will
revise its capital spending expectations in February to reflect
the acquisition.  The Marcellus Shale, which stretches from  Canada  to
 Kentucky , is estimated to hold 262 trillion cubic feet of gas,
according to Bloomberg Industries. Production from the formation
in Pennsylvania more than doubled in the second quarter to 3.35
billion cubic feet a day from a year earlier.  Williams Partners also will acquire Delphiâ€™s Mansfield
gathering system in the Barnett Shale region of Texas, Jeff Pounds, a spokesman, said today in an e-mail. The partnership
announced Dec. 1 it was in exclusive talks with Delphi for both
systems.  Williams Partners rose less than 1 percent to $59.90 at
11:49 a.m. in New York. The units have gained 28 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
