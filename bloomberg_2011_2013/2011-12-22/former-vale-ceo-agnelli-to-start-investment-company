     Dec. 22 (Bloomberg) --Roger Agnelli, the former chief
executive officer of  Vale SA (VALE3) , created a financial company
in Brazil to invest in energy, logistics and mining.  The company, called AGN Participacoes, has three units that
will focus on fuel production from biomass, ports, and medium-
scale mining in Brazil and Africa, Agnelli said in e-mailed
response to questions today. The firm will start operating at
the start of next year, he said.  Exame magazine reported this week that Agnelli will partner
with Jair Ribeiro, co-chief executive officer of  Banco Indusval
SA (IDVL3) , and that it will start operating in January.   To contact the reporter on this story:
