LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the worldâ€™s
second-largest maker of televisions, said it aims to boost TV
sales 20 percent this year, helped by models showing 3-D images.  LG targets to sell about 30 million liquid-crystal display
TVs this year, compared with about 25 million sets sold in 2011,
Lee Kwan Sup, a vice president at the TV business, said in Seoul
today. LG aims to become the largest seller of 3-D TVs this year
and capture about 25 percent of the global market for such
products, according to a company statement.  The Seoul-based company and its bigger competitor  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930)  are turning to 3-D and Internet technologies to
lure buyers. Global shipments of LCD TVs may have reached 206
million units last year, falling short of an earlier projection
of 211 million units, researcher DisplaySearch said in October.  LG also plans to start selling TVs using the organic light-
emitting diode, or OLED, technology, which produces sharper
images than LCD, in the second half of this year, the company
said earlier this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
