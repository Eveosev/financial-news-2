The  European Central Bank  said there
are signs the economy is stabilizing and the ECB’s record loans
to financial institutions will help to support growth.  While “the economic outlook remains subject to high
uncertainty,” there are “tentative signs of a stabilization in
activity at low levels,” the Frankfurt-based central bank said
in its monthly report today, echoing President  Mario Draghi ’s
Jan. 12 policy statement. The ECB’s unlimited loans “will
continue to support euro-area banks, and thus the financing of
the real economy.”  With the euro area on the brink of a second recession in
three years, some signs of economic resilience have given the
ECB room to assess the impact of its stimulus measures to date.
Draghi said on Jan. 16 the ECB’s three-year loans to banks
averted a “serious” credit contraction. He also noted that
borrowing costs for governments across the 17-nation region have
dropped.  Investor confidence in Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy,
jumped the most on record this month and French business
confidence climbed from a two-year low in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
