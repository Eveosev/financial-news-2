Siemens AG (SIE)  plans to focus on organic
growth at its solar unit,  Financial Times Deutschland  said,
citing an interview with Theodor Scheidegger, head of the German
company’s solar and hydro division.  The Munich-based company would look at potential targets
that come up for sale and may invest should they see
“promising” new technologies, Scheidegger said, citing the
German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
