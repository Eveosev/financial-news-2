OPEC will cut exports from near
their highest in a year because of lower demand from refiners in
 Asia  as the northern hemisphere winter nears its end, according
to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will  ship 
23.35 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Feb. 4, 0.5
percent less than the 23.47 million transported in the period to
Jan. 7, the Halifax, England-based researcher said today in an
e-mailed report. The figures exclude Angola and Ecuador.  “Middle East shipments are down largely because of
sailings eastbound,” said Roy Mason, Oil Movements’ founder,
adding that flows are likely to rebound later in February as
winter volumes reach their final peak.  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will drop 1.2 percent to 17.5 million
barrels a day in the four weeks, according to the report.  Crude on board tankers will average 472.36 million barrels
in the four-week period, down 2.1 percent from 482.64 million in
the period to Jan. 7, according to the report.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-
rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships
as floating storage.  OPEC’s members, which pump 40 percent of the world’s oil,
are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq, Kuwait,  Libya ,
 Nigeria , Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
