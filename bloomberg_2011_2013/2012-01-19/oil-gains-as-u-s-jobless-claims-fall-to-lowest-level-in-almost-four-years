Oil declined for the fifth time in
six days after U.S. gasoline consumption tumbled to the lowest
level in 10 years and inventories rose.  Crude fell after the Energy Department said  gasoline use 
dropped to 8 million barrels a day last week, the lowest level
since September 2001. Stockpiles of the motor fuel climbed 3.72
million barrels to 227.5 million, a 10-month high.  “The product data was not supportive, especially
gasoline,” said  Tom Bentz , a director with BNP Paribas Prime
Brokerage Inc. “Gasoline data certainly is tempering the
bullishness in the early going when crude was trying to rally.”  Crude for February delivery slid 20 cents, or 0.2 percent,
to settle at $100.39 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Oil has gained 17 percent in the past three months.  Brent oil for March settlement rose 89 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $111.55 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  The gain in gasoline stockpiles exceeded the 2.35 million
median estimate of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.
Demand declined for the third week in a row.  “The build in gasoline inventories may be short-lived, but
it is bearish for crude,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market
strategist and founder of Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “Gasoline
demand is down and the market is still playing defense.”  Crude Stockpiles Drop  Crude stockpiles  fell 3.44 million barrels to 331.2
million. Analysts expected a gain of 3 million. Yesterday the
 American Petroleum Institute  reported stockpiles dropped 4.81
million barrels to 330.1 million.  “We had a draw in crude but a big increase in gasoline, so
the numbers are kind of mixed,” said Jason Schenker, president
of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy
consultant. “The drop in crude inventories wasn’t as bullish as
yesterday’s API numbers and the market is a bit disappointed.”  Inventories of  distillate fuels , which include heating oil
and diesel, grew 438,000 barrels to 148 million. Analysts
expected a gain of 1.38 million.  Stockpiles at  Cushing (DOESCROK) ,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
Nymex oil futures, declined for a fifth week, down 2.9 percent
to 28.3 million barrels. That’s the lowest level in more than
two years.  Total petroleum demand  increased for the first time in four
weeks, up 0.5 percent to 17.9 million barrels a day.  Early Advance  Oil rose 1.5 percent in early trading after the Labor
Department said jobless  claims  plunged by 50,000 to 352,000 in
the week ended Jan. 14, the lowest level since April 2008.  The claims were lower than the  median  forecast of 384,000
in a Bloomberg News survey. The drop in the claims was the
biggest since September 2005.  “The  U.S. economy  continues to look better,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut. “The market seems to have a support at
$100. As long as we don’t have a European recession, the market
is poised for another run past $104.”  The  International Energy Agency  sees no urgency to release
oil stockpiles amid threats from Iran to disrupt traffic in the
Strait of Hormuz,  Fatih Birol , the group’s chief economist, said
in an interview. Almost one-fifth of the world’s oil trade flows
through the strait, according to the Energy Department.  Iran’s ambassador to the  United Nations ,  Mohammad Khazaee ,
said yesterday that closing the strait is an option if his
country’s security is endangered. European Union foreign
ministers are scheduled to meet Jan. 23 to discuss a ban on
purchases of Iranian crude, which the IEA said may happen within
six months.  “Geopolitical tensions always put some kind of floor on
 oil prices ,” said Phil Streible, a Chicago-based commodities
broker at RJO Futures. “Eventually we are probably going to see
that embargo take place.”  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 580,080
contracts as of 3:43 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 706,898
yesterday, 17 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.37 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
