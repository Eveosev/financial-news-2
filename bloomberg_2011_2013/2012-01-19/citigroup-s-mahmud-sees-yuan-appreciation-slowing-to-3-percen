Nadir Mahmud, managing director and
Asia head of foreign-exchange and local markets trading in
 Singapore  at Citigroup Inc., comments on the outlook for the
Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Indonesia rupiah in a media
briefing.  On the yuan:  “Since they un-pegged in June of 2010, there’s been a very
almost systematic and steady appreciation of the currency in the
5 percent range per annum. With the slowdown in the Chinese
economy, although they are trying to counter that by getting
banks to increase their lending and they will be easing monetary
policy as well, I think the rate of currency appreciation will
also have to come down from the 5 percent kind of level.  ‘‘Depending on how much the economy slows and how quickly
it slows, our best estimate at this point is the 5 percent will
probably be changed to a 3 percent appreciation.’’  On the rupee:  ‘‘The  Indian rupee  surprised everybody by how much it
weakened. I think now the rupee is probably going to track most
of the Asian currencies. The big issue with the rupee is what
they’re doing on the fiscal side. We don’t think it’s going to
be an underperformer with respect to the other Asian currencies,
at least from where it is valued from at this point.”  On the rupiah:  “The rupiah is going to strengthen. We’ve liked Indonesian
markets for a long time. We like the fixed-income markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
