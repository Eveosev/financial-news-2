Gasoline in  Chicago  weakened to the
lowest level in 46 months as the government reported regional
inventories of the fuel increased.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  dropped 6.5 cents to 31 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile exchange  at 2:33 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It is the lowest level
since March 4, 2008. Prompt delivery for the fuel fell 7.61
cents to $2.5043 a gallon.  Gasoline inventories in the Midwest gained for the last
seven out of nine weeks, to the highest level since the week
ending Feb. 25, the Energy Department reported today.  Crude inputs at Midwest refineries declined 196,000 barrels
to 3.24 million barrels a day last week, government data showed.
Refiners in the previous week processed the most oil since July
2000.  Hovensa LLC announced yesterday that the St. Croix refinery
in the  U.S. Virgin Islands  will shut because of weak demand.  Hovensa, a partnership of Hess Corp. and Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, said it will close the plant by mid-February and
convert it into an oil storage terminal. The refinery supplied
2.7 percent of U.S. East Coast gasoline demand in October.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in  New York  Harbor, narrowed 0.37 cent to 0.38
cent a gallon versus futures traded at 1:55 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
