Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the
maker of International brand trucks, fell the most in four weeks
after Courthouse News reported it lost a bid to force the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to recall certain 2010 engines.  Navistar slid as much as 5.1 percent to $39.55, the biggest
drop since Dec. 21, and recovered to $39.65 at 1:01 p.m. New
York time. Navistar gained 10 percent this year through
yesterday after falling 35 percent in 2011.  The company lost in its attempt at the U.S. District Court
for the  District of Columbia  to force the EPA to recall its
competitors’ model year 2010 engines using selective catalyst
reduction to cut truck emissions, Courthouse News Service
reported yesterday. Navistar said that technology doesn’t comply
with standards being written under the Clear Air Act, Courthouse
News said.  Navistar chose to meet tightening federal standards with
exhaust gas recirculation, and its sales have suffered.
Competitors including  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  and  Daimler AG (DAI)  have adopted
selective catalyst reduction technology.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
