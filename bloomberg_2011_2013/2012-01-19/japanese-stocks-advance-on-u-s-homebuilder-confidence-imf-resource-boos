Japanese  shares  rose, sending the
 Nikkei (NKY)  225 Stock Average to its highest close in more than a
month, after confidence among U.S. homebuilders topped estimates
and the  International Monetary Fund  said it may expand its
lending resources to counter  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a consumer electronics maker that gets 70
percent of its sales overseas, rose 1.7 percent.  Sumco Corp. (3436) , a
maker of silicon wafers, gained the most on the Nikkei 225 after
Europe’s biggest maker of chip equipment forecast higher orders.
Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., which has benefited from
 China ’s building boom, climbed 2.8 percent on speculation
capital requirements for mainland lenders may be relaxed.  The Nikkei rose 1 percent to 8,639.68 at the 3 p.m. close
in  Tokyo , the highest since Dec. 12. The broader  Topix (MXAP)  Index
climbed 0.8 percent to 740.68, with almost three stocks rising
for two shares that fell.  “Investors around the world are starting to think about
taking risks again,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at
Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees the equivalent of $68
billion. “Economic data out of the U.S. has been relatively
firm and Europe doesn’t look like it’s going to fall into chaos
right away.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent
today. The gauge advanced 1.1 percent in  New York  yesterday
after  confidence  among U.S. homebuilders rose in January to the
highest level since 2007.  Europe ‘Safety Net’  Shares also gained after a Greek Finance Ministry official
told reporters the government could reach an agreement with
creditors by the end of this week and the IMF proposed raising
its lending capacity by as much as $500 billion to fight the
debt crisis.  “It’s good that the IMF is also enhancing the safety net
for European financial firms,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees about $600 million at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
Co. in Tokyo.  Sony, which depends on Europe for a fifth of its sales, 1.7
percent to 1,326 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  added 1.4 percent to
2,621 yen.  The Topix has gained 1.7 percent this year, compared with a
4 percent gain by the  S&P 500  and a 3.7 percent rise by the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks on the Japanese gauge are valued
at 15.3 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.5
times for the S&P 500 and 10.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  ASML Orders  Semiconductor-related companies gained after Netherlands-
based ASML Holding NV forecast higher orders for chipmaking
equipment in the first quarter. Shares also advanced after
Linear Technology Corp., which makes chips for cars and
industrial equipment, forecast sales in the March quarter that
would beat analysts’ estimates.  Sumco, the world’s biggest supplier of the silicon wafers
used to make chips, surged 9.4 percent to 607 yen.  Advantest (6857) 
Corp., which makes testers for semiconductors, jumped 7 percent
to 753 yen.  Chinese banking regulators are considering a plan to boost
growth by easing  reserve requirements  for lenders, four people
with knowledge of the matter said. The world’s second-largest
economy, and  Japan ’s biggest export market, expanded at the
slowest pace in 10 quarters in the three months through December.  Hitachi Construction increased 2.8 percent to 1,459 yen.
 TDK Corp. (6762) , a manufacturer of electronic parts which gets almost
a third of its sales from China, advanced 4.6 percent to 3,530
yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
