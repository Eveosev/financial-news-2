Copper rose to the highest level in
four months on better-than-expected U.S. data and signs of
credit easing in  China , which boosted the demand outlook from
the largest user. Other base metals also advanced.  Three-month delivery copper gained for a fourth day,
climbing as much as 1.6 percent to $8,372 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange, the highest level since Sept. 21, before
trading at $8,355 by 3 p.m. Shanghai time. The metal for March-
delivery on the Comex in New York climbed as much as 1.5 percent
to a four-month high of $3.8085 per pound.  “Overall  market sentiment  is a lot better than a couple of
weeks ago, without further negative surprises from Europe,”
Lian Zheng, an analyst at Xinhu Futures Co., said by phone from
 Shanghai . “With better U.S. data and the expectation for some
sort of easing in China, copper is now targeting $8,500.”  China’s banking regulator is weighing a plan to relax
 capital requirements  for lenders, delaying implementing the most
stringent capital adequacy ratios, and may lower risk weightings
for loans to small companies, four people with knowledge of the
matter said.  Copper for April-delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
closed 1.9 percent higher at 60,560 yuan ($9,585) a ton.  The  International Monetary Fund  is aiming to raise its
lending capacity by as much as $500 billion after identifying a
potential need for $1 trillion in financing in coming years.
U.S. factory output climbed the most in December, the most in a
year, while homebuilder confidence rose to the highest level in
more than four years.  On the LME, aluminum rose 0.8 percent to $2,222 a ton and
zinc gained 0.7 percent to $2,015 a ton. Lead advanced 0.4
percent to $2,148.25 per ton, nickel climbed 0.9 percent to
$19,670 per ton and tin added 1 percent to $22,001 per ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
