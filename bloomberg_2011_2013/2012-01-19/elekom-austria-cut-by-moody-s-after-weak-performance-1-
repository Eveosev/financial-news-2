Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  was cut one level
today by Moody’s Investors Service after the company’s weak
operating performance strained the former phone monopoly’s
finances.  The operator was cut a notch, to Baa1 from A3, on the
“expectation that  Telekom Austria ’s operating performance will
remain weak,” Moody’s said in a statement. The investment-grade
rating is three levels above junk credit. The outlook is stable.  The Austrian government’s 28.4 percent stake in the
operator spared Telekom  Austria  from being cut by another grade,
Moody’s said. The company, which owns mobile networks in seven
eastern European countries, may face liquidity constraints as it
pays back 1 billion euros ($1.29 billion) of debt this year.  Telekom Austria cut its 2011 and 2012 dividend forecasts by
half on Dec. 16, citing the adverse economic climate and
investments that will weight on its  cash flow . Private-equity
investor Ronny Pecik, who controls 20.1 percent of the company
through shares and options, had criticized Telekom Austria’s
dividend policies.  Moody’s expects that new investments “will exert further
pressure on Telekom Austris’s financial ratios and that this
will not be completely offset by the group’s recently announced
cut in dividends,” Carlos Winzer, an analyst at Moody’s, said
in the note.  Telekom Austria’s revenue is expected to decline for a
sixth straight year in 2012, according to  data collected  by
Bloomberg. Telekom Austria forecast earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of 1.55 billion euros in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
