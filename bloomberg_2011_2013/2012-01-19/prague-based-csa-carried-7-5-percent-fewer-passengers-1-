Ceske Aerolinie AS, the Czech state
carrier known as CSA, carried 7.5 percent fewer passengers in
2011 than in the previous year as it reduced operations amid
operating losses.  The airline carried 4.25 million passengers, vice president
Jiri Marek said at a press conference in  Prague  today. The
number of travelers from the Commonwealth of Independent States
rose 8 percent from 2010.  The unprofitable carrier has reduced the number of planes
and flights and spun-off units in a bid to narrow its losses and
streamline operations. The state-controlled company, which is
seeking a strategic partner, had to cancel flights in December
due to pilot protests against planned layoffs.  The company has withdrawn flights from Scandinavia and the
 Middle East  which were not economically viable, Marek said. The
carrier will open new destinations in  Russia , including Niznij
Novgorod, where Czech companies are present.  CSA is better placed in Russia and serves more destinations
there than its Western European competitors such as Air France,
the executive said. Ticket sales in the  Commonwealth of
Independent States  continue to grow while sales from Western
Europe are stagnating, the executive said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
