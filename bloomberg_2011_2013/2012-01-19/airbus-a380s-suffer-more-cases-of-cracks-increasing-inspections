Airbus SAS’s flagship A380
superjumbo planes will require regular inspections after
additional cracks appeared on wings, the  European Aviation
Safety Agency  said today.  EASA plans to issue an airworthiness directive tomorrow
advising airlines on procedures, Dominique Fouda, a spokesman
for the agency, said by phone from Cologne,  Germany . Safety
experts haven’t yet determined how often the planes will need to
be checked, he said.  Tomorrow’s safety ruling follows separate incidents last
week, with reports from Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Qantas
Airways Ltd. that “small cracks” had been found in plane-wing
parts. Those faults, which are linked to a manufacturing issue,
can be fixed during scheduled four-year maintenance checks,
according to Airbus.  Some additional cracks have been found on a limited number
of non-critical brackets,  Justin Dubon , an Airbus spokesman,
said by phone. In line with European safety regulations, Airbus
has established an inspection and repair program, he said.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s fleet of eight A380s is as yet
unaffected by the cracks, Patrick Meschenmoser, a Frankfurt-
based spokesman, said by phone.  Airbus is a unit of  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.   To contact the reporter on this story:
