Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban should replace Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  because
the minister no longer has credibility, Gyorgy Kopits, the
former head of the independent Fiscal Council, told Heti Valasz.  “Gyorgy Matolcsy no longer has credibility domestically or
abroad,” Kopits told the weekly in an  interview  published
today. “The economic policy followed thus has been a failure.”  The fact that Matolcsy isn’t the chief negotiator with the
 International Monetary Fund  on a bailout is “an
acknowledgment” of this, the weekly cited Kopits as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
