Russian stocks rose for a fourth day
as oil gained after the number of Americans filing for
 unemployment benefits  fell to the lowest level in almost four
years, indicating an economic recovery in the world’s largest
oil consumer.  The 30-stock  Micex (INDEXCF)  Index climbed 0.7 percent to 1,503.7 by
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its highest since Dec. 5. Oil
producers OAO Surgutneftegas and OAO Gazprom Neft rallied 3
percent and 2.2 percent, respectively. Pipeline operator  OAO
Transneft (TRNFP)  gained on reports it was seeking to expand into
 Croatia . The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 1 percent to
1,503.89.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, climbed as much as 1
percent to $101.64 a barrel in  New York  after the Labor
Department reported jobless claims plunged by 50,000 to 352,000
in the week ended Jan. 14, the lowest level since April 2008.
Oil also gained after  Iran ’s ambassador to the United Nations
said yesterday that closing the Strait of Hormuz is an option if
his country’s security is endangered.  “The U.S. numbers are helpful but they have merely
augmented a rally that has been well underway all week,” Julian Rimmer, a trader Russian shares at CF Global Trading in  London ,
wrote in e-mailed comments.  Transneft rose 1.7 percent to 57,829 rubles. The company is
interested in building pipelines in Croatia, after Kommersant
reported, citing spokesman Igor Dyomin. Transneft may secure a
contract from Russian oil company OAO Zarubezhneft, the
newspaper said.  Lowest Valuation  The Micex has gained 7.2 percent this year and trades at
5.7 times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies,
second to  Egypt ’s EGX30 Index for the lowest valuation among the
21 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg.  The index dropped 17 percent in 2011, compared with an 18
percent slide for Brazil’s Bovespa index, which trades at 9.8
times estimated earnings according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at 9.4 times
estimated earnings, and the BSE India Sensitive Index has a
ratio of 14.6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
