Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. , the best
performer last year in the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index, tumbled
after natural-gas futures declined to the lowest price in almost
10 years.  Cabot, based in Houston,  dropped  6.5 percent to $63.09 at
the close in  New York . Earlier, the stock fell as much as 7.5
percent to $62.40.  Natural gas for February delivery declined 15 cents to
settle at $2.322 per million British thermal units in New York,
the lowest settlement price since Feb. 25, 2002.  Cabot shares doubled in 2011 to $75.90 as output rose. The
company this month announced a stock split and dividend increase
after more than doubling gas output from the Marcellus Shale in
a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
