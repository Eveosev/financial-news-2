Bank Audi SAL-Audi Saradar Group (AUSR) ,
the largest lender in Lebanon by assets, said profit rose 7
percent last year as interest income and fees increased.  Net income climbed to 544 billion Lebanese pounds ($362
million) from 508 billion pounds in 2010, the Beirut-based bank
said in a statement.  The period “reflects the precautionary policy adopted by
management throughout the year to consolidate the bank’s
resilience to adverse domestic and regional developments, while
continuing to favor operating conditions over growth to sustain
its high financial flexibility and efficiency,” the bank said
in an e-mailed statement.  A revolt against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad broke in
March amid popular movements that toppled leaders in Tunisia,
Egypt and  Libya , while forcing Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh to agree to cede power.  Turkey ’s regulator gave a license to Bank Audi in October
to set up a bank, the first such permission in more than a
decade. Turkey hasn’t awarded a new banking license since a
financial crisis in 2001 saw the number of lenders drop to 61 at
the start of 2002 from 81 two years earlier.  Net interest income rose to 18 percent to 815 billion
pounds, while fee and commission income gained to 278 billion
pounds from 263 billion pounds in 2010. Loan provisions more
than doubled to 167 billion pounds.  Total assets were $28.7 billion at the end of December and
deposits reached $24.7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
