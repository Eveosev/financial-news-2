Terrell Owens , whose 15,934
receiving yards ranks second in National Football League history
to  Jerry Rice , has signed a professional contract with the Allen
Wranglers of the  Indoor Football League .  Owens, 38, didn’t play in the NFL last season after having
knee surgery in April. He receives a contract worth between
$250,000 and $500,000 to play with the Allen, Texas-based
Wranglers, who begin their 14-game season on Feb. 25.  “I’m headed back to Texas, that’s right IFL, here I
come,” Owens, who played with the  Dallas Cowboys  from 2006
through 2008, said in a  video  on his website.  Owens has 1,078 career NFL receptions, ranking sixth, and
his 153 touchdown catches are tied with  Randy Moss  for the
second-most behind Rice.  While out of football rehabbing his knee injury, Owens said
on his reality television show that he’s had money problems,
citing mortgages on his real estate properties and child support
payments. He cried on “The T.O. Show” in September while
discussing his financial situation and his frustration with the
person who was managing his money.  “Football season is on a standstill and I have no income
at this point, none,” Owens  said  on the show.  The IFL features 16 teams across the U.S., from the Lehigh
Valley in Pennsylvania to Everett,  Washington . The Sioux Falls
Storm from South Dakota won last year’s championship and the
IFL’s 2012 season runs from February through June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
