     Jan. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Li Ning Co. (2331)  said it will sell 750
million yuan ($119 million) of convertible bonds to TPG Capital
and  Singapore ’s government, and that 2011 sales may have fallen
as much as 7 percent and profit margins narrowed.  The Chinese retailer and maker of shoes and sportswear,
founded by the former Olympic gymnast of the same name, will use
proceeds from the five-year, 4 percent bonds to boost its brand,
open stores and fund product development, according to a Hong
Kong stock exchange statement yesterday.  The company in August said first-half net income plummeted
49 percent from a year earlier to 294 million yuan as costs and
competition increased. The full-year profit margin for 2011 may
have shrunk as much as 8 percentage points from 2010’s 11.7
percent,  Li Ning  said in a separate filing yesterday.  Li Ning cited “flat” order growth and inventory
repurchases from distributors, and said margins declined on its
new wholesale discounting policy while its cost index may have
gained as much as 8 percentage points.  For this year, Li Ning said it will cut costs “across the
board,” except for marketing and research-and-development, and
will seek to control procurement expense to protect profit
margins. The company will clear inventory at the retail level
and seek to use the London Olympics to boost its brand image.  TPG will buy 561 million yuan of the convertible bonds and
Government of Singapore Investment Corp. will take 189 million
yuan through is private-equity arm, Li Ning said. The bonds are
convertible to shares at HK$7.74 each, a 15 percent premium to
the last traded price of HK$6.72.  Li Ning’s stock was suspended Jan. 18, before the filing,
and will resume trading in  Hong Kong  today. The shares dropped
63 percent in 2011, and have gained 8.9 percent this year,
compared with an 8.2 percent increase in the benchmark  Hang Seng 
index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
