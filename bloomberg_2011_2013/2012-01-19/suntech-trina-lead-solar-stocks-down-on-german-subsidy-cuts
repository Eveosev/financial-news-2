Solar companies including Suntech
Power Holdings Co.,  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  and  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  fell
in  New York  trading after Germany said it will make monthly
subsidy cuts to slow demand for panels in the country, the
world’s largest market.  Suntech, the biggest solar-panel maker, fell 14 percent to
$3.20 at the close. Trina dropped 16 percent to $8.28 and First
Solar, the biggest thin-film solar company, declined 10 percent
to $38.70. They helped drag down the Bloomberg Global Leaders
Solar Index of 37 companies, which slipped 3.4 percent.  Germany Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen today said
the country will cut its feed-in tariffs, or premium rates for
electricity from solar energy, monthly instead of the current
twice a year.  Germany  added a record 7.5 gigawatts of solar
panels last year, more than double the government’s target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
