Treasuries snapped a decline as
officials in  Greece  and private creditors prepare to meet for a
third day to seek agreement on reducing the nation’s debt.  Demand for the relative safety of Treasuries during
 Europe ’s fiscal crisis has pushed an index of U.S. securities
due in 10 years and longer up 31 percent in the past year. It
was the best performance among 144 government-bond indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies, after accounting for currency changes. The
 World Bank  this week cut its 2012 forecast for U.S. economic
growth to 2.2 percent from 2.9 percent.  “We’re favoring long-term bonds,” said Hiromasa Nakamura,
a senior investor at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo , which
oversees the equivalent of $42.7 billion and is a unit of
 Japan ’s second-largest publicly traded bank by assets. “The
economic situation is fragile.”  Ten-year  yields  held at 1.97 percent as of 10:39 a.m. in
Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
security maturing in November 2021 changed hands at 100 7/32.  The rate increased 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage
point, over the past two days. It rose 11 basis points this week.  Greek debt-swap talks between the government and the
Institute of International Finance are scheduled to continue in
Athens today. The Washington-based institute represents private
bondholders in the discussions to reduce Greece’s borrowings.  Treasury 10-year yields rose yesterday by the most this
year after a government report showed fewer Americans filed for
 unemployment benefits  than forecast.  ‘Reload on Longs’  Initial jobless  claims  plunged by 50,000 to 352,000 in the
week ended Jan. 14, the lowest since April 2008, the Labor
Department said. The median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey projected a drop to 384,000.  The difference between two- and 10-year  yields  widened to
1.76 percentage points yesterday, the most since Jan. 6.  “The global economic outlook will remain challenged,”
 William O’Donnell , head U.S. government-bond strategist in
Stamford, Connecticut, at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS
Securities primary dealer unit, wrote in a note to clients. “We
advocate that longer-term investors use back-ups to reload on
longs,” or bets bonds will gain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
