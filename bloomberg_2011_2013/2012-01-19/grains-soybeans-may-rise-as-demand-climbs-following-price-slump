What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 4 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that demand
for U.S. supplies will rise after prices slumped almost 9
percent in the past week,  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C
Trading Co. in Fowler, Indiana, said in a telephone interview.
Adverse weather has also reduced crop prospects in South
America, he said.  -- Soybean futures may open 9 cents to 12 cents a bhusel higher
in Chicago on speculation that adverse weather threatening
yields in South America will spur increased Chinese purchases of
U.S. supplies, Gerlach said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open 0.3 cent to 0.5 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal
futures may open $3 to $4 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that the 25 percent drop in prices
in the past 12 months will increase export demand for U.S. grain
Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
