Pay for  London  lawyers rose 10
percent last year to 146,500 pounds ($225,800) as firms competed
for a limited supply of attorneys, a legal recruiter said.  Average base pay for salaried lawyers in the British
capital rose 4 percent to 111,000 pounds and bonuses increased
to 35,500 pounds, recruiter  Laurence Simons  said in a statement.
In comparison, base pay rose 2.1 percent in 2011 for
accountants, and 1.2 percent for all U.K. professionals, the
recruiter said.  Pay and bonuses for lawyers have “been pushed up by the
limited supply of talent in their market, making retention the
name of the game,” said Lucinda Moule, managing director at
Laurence Simons. “A tough 2010 means employers have focused
primarily on boosting salaries rather than increasing
headcount.”  At least three top London-based law firms raised salaries
for lawyers last year after freezing or cutting pay by as much
as 11 percent.  Clifford Chance LLP (1000L) ,  Freshfields Bruckhaus
Deringer LLP (1002L)  and  Slaughter and May  raised salaries and said they
would pay bonuses last June. More experienced lawyers that have
partnership interests in a firm are paid based on the firm’s
financial performance rather than receiving a set salary.  Top U.S. firms still offer higher salaries in London, with
Bingham McCutchen LLP and others paying 100,000 pounds to start,
to match New York levels. London legal salaries are comparable
to entry-level pay at a financial company, without the promise
of a large bonus.  The average bonus for salaried London lawyers rose to 32
percent of their salary, Laurence Simons said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
