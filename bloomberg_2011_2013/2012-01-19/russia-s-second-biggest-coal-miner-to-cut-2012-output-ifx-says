OAO Kuzbassrazrezugol (KZRU) ,  Russia ’s
second-largest coal producer, decreased output 5 percent last
year and plans a 4 percent cut this year to improve mining
efficiency, Interfax reported from Siberia.  Kuzbassrazrezugol produced 47 million metric tons of coal
last year, including more than 5 million tons of steelmaking
coal, the newswire said citing a company statement distributed
to reporters in Kemerovo region, where the miner is based.  This year, the company plans production of 45 million tons
of coal and capital spending of 25 billion rubles ($795
million), Interfax reported.  Siberian Coal Energy Co., or SUEK, is Russia’s largest coal
