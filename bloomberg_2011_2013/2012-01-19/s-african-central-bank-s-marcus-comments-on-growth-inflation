South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus made the following comments after a meeting of the
bank’s monetary policy committee in  Pretoria  today.  “Growth in consumption expenditure by households remains
the main driver of growth in the economy.  ‘‘Administered priced remain a concern in the inflation
outlook.  ‘‘Food prices remain a major driver of inflation.  ‘‘The employment losses suffered during the recession have
still not been recovered and future employment prospects remain
uncertain given the fragile economic outlook.  ‘‘The MPC has reflected on the various risks to the
inflation outlook and considers these risks to be fairly evenly
balanced, notwithstanding the reality that the  exchange rate 
remains a significant source of uncertainty. The main downside
risk continues to emanate from global economic developments.  ‘‘The MPC is also cognizant of the slowing domestic economy
and feels that given the lack of demand pressures, monetary
tightening at this stage would not be appropriate.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
