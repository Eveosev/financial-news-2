Bio Architecture Lab Inc., the U.S.
biotechnology company that turns seaweed into ethanol, will open
a pilot plant in  Chile  in the third quarter to tap the growing
demand for biofuels in developing regions.  The plant will crush seaweed grown in four ocean farms and
ferment the sugary juices into alcohol, Chief Executive Officer
Daniel Trunfio Jr. said yesterday in an interview.  Bio Architecture’s technology is well-suited for  emerging
markets  in Asia and  South America  with established aquaculture
industries and growing demand for transport fuels, Trunfio said.  “It’s a perfect fit,” he said. “Energy demand is growing
in the same places seaweed is plentiful.”  Building a plant in the U.S. would be “about two or three
times more expensive,” than in Chile, he said. It will have
annual production capacity of 6,000 liters (1,600 gallons) of a
diluted form of ethanol a year. About 60 percent of the dry
biomass of seaweed is fermentable carbohydrates.  Bio Architecture, based in Berkeley,  California , is seeking
funds to build a second pilot project next year to process
seaweed into chemicals including precursors for nylon and green
plastics, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
