Central and eastern  Europe ’s
economic outlook improved in January on optimism about the euro
area, the  ZEW Center for European Economic Research  and  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS)  said.  The economic-sentiment indicator, a measure of investor
confidence in the region, rose 14.8 points to minus 26.6 points,
the Mannheim, Germany-based ZEW and Vienna-based Erste Bank said
today in an e-mailed statement.  “The increase in experts’ expectations is consistent with
their overall expectations for the  euro zone ,” they said in the
statement.  Eastern Europe counts western nations in the neighboring
euro region among its biggest trading partners, with Poland
selling more than half of its exports there. There are
“tentative signs of a stabilization in activity at low
levels,” the  European Central Bank  said in a monthly report
today. The ECB said its unlimited loans “will continue to
support euro-area banks.”  Investor confidence in  Germany , Europe’s largest economy,
jumped the most on record in January, while French business
confidence climbed from a two-year low in December.  Romania’s economic expectations index rose the most among
the eight countries surveyed in central and eastern Europe,
rising 47.4 points to minus 5.3 points. Hungary’s index rose by
20.6 points, the smallest increase, to minus 36.6 points.  The ZEW index reflects the difference between the
percentage of analysts who have positive outlooks and those with
negative views. Ratings range from a maximum of 100 points to a
minimum of minus 100 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
