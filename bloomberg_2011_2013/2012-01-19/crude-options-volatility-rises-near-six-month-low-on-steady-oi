Crude oil options volatility rose
for the first time in five sessions, holding near a six-month
low as underlying futures reversed an early gain to settle lower
for a second day.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 30 as of 3 p.m. in  New York , up from 29.4
yesterday.  “We’ve been in a range of only about $2 and, when you have
a range like that, it doesn’t help volatility,” said Ray
Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York and a
trader at the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Crude for February delivery fell 20 cents to settle at
$100.39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The March
contract declined 22 cents to $100.54.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
April $125 calls, with 6,188 lots changing hands at 3:25 p.m.
They rose 3 cents to 50 cents a barrel. March $90 puts, the
second-most active option, gained 3 cents to 55 cents with 1,862
lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  “We were selling everything today, calls and puts, betting
we’re going to stay in a range,” Carbone said.  Calls were 58 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Six of the seven most active options yesterday were puts,
which accounted for about half of the total volume. March $135
calls were the most actively traded, with 9,230 lots changing
hands as they were unchanged at 12 cents a barrel. The next-most
active options, March $80 puts, declined 2 cents to 11 cents on
volume of 5,391 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $80 puts with 39,531
contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 38,765 lots and
December $150 calls with 36,907.  To contact the reporter on this story:
