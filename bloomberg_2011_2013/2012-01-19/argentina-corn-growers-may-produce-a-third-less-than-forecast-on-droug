Corn growers in  Argentina , the
world’s second-largest exporter of the grain, may reap a third
less than initially forecast after a drought damaged crops.  Corn farming groups represented by the Maizar association
are expecting as little as 20 million metric tons of output this
season, compared with estimates of a record 30 million tons in
November before the dry spell began, said Martin Fraguio,
executive director of the group.  The La Nina weather pattern has brought excessive heat and
dryness to crops in parts of Argentina, Brazil and  Mexico  in the
past two months. Output losses in Argentina include grain
planted in October that suffered irreparable damage and corn
that may not be sowed if rain levels are insufficient in coming
weeks, Fraguio said.  “The situation is disastrous and the loss is enormous,”
Fraguio said in a telephone interview from  Buenos Aires 
yesterday. “The most pessimistic estimates are for 20 or 21
million tons.”  Rain expected in the next few days and replanting in areas
affected by the drought may help diminish the impact of the
drought on output, he said.  Corn for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to $5.9775 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 7:00 a.m, after dropping
1.7 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
