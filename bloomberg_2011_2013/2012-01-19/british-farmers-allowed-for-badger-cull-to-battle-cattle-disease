British farmers in West Somerset
and West Gloucestershire will be allowed to apply for licenses
to shoot badgers to control the spread of bovine tuberculosis.  About 25,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2010 because of the
disease, costing 91 million pounds ($140 million), the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in a
report on its website today. Taxpayers have paid about 500
million pounds to control the disease in  England  in the past 10
years, the government said.  About 3,622 cases of bovine tuberculosis were found in
2010, up 7.5 percent from the prior year, Defra data show.  Bovine tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by
bacteria that infects cattle, badgers, deer, dogs and cats,
according to Defra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
