Alstom SA (ALO)   reported quarterly sales
and orders that fell short of analyst estimates as the maker of
power-equipment and trains joins competitors feeling the pinch
from reduced  government spending  on transport and
infrastructure.  Orders in the three months Dec. 31 slid to 4.89 billion
euros ($6.29 billion) from 5.49 billion euros a year earlier,
Levallois-Perret, France-based Alstom said today in a statement.
That compares with an estimate of 5.2 billion euros at Sanford
C. Bernstein & Co. Sales fell 7.1 percent to 4.87 billion euros,
compared with an average  analyst estimate  of 5.03 billion euros.  Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe â€™s largest engineering company, predicted
stagnant profit for this year in November as sales growth
moderates and a cooling global economy damps demand for
industrial gear, and pressure has increased since November,
according to Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
