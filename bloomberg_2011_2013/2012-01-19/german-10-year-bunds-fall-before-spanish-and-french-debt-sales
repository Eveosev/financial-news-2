German 10-year  government bonds  fell
as stocks around the world advanced and borrowing costs declined
at auctions of French and Spanish debt.  France’s 10-year bonds erased a drop as the nation
auctioned 7.97 billion euros ($10.28 billion) at its first sale
of medium- and long-maturity debt since losing its top  credit
rating  at  Standard & Poor’s . Spanish debt fell as it sold 6.61
billion euros of notes and bonds, exceeding its maximum target
of 4.5 billion euros. Greek note yields swung between gains and
losses as the nation moved closer to an agreement to cut the
nation’s debt load.  “The general mood is quite positive,” said  Brian Barry ,
an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in  London . “Auctions are going
well and yields are coming down. The French auction shows that
the downgrade hasn’t really impacted on their borrowing costs.
Investors are getting more accustomed with an environment where
AAA ratings aren’t there.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.83 percent at 3:19 p.m. London time. The
2 percent bond due in January 2022 fell 0.425, or 4.25 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 101.515. The two-year yield was
little changed at 0.20 percent.  French two-year note yields climbed seven basis points to
0.79 percent even after borrowing costs fell at today’s auction
of 2014, 2015 and 2016 securities.  French, Spanish Auctions  Spanish benchmark 10-year bonds fell after Fitch Ratings
Managing Director  Edward Parker  said he has “doubts” over
whether  Spain  can reach its deficit targets for 2012 and 2013
after overshooting its projected shortfall last year.  Spain today sold more than its target of bonds due in 2016,
2019 and 2022. That brings its year-to-date sales to
approximately 19 percent of its anticipated 2012 issuance,
according to an e-mailed note to investors from Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank.  The average yield at the sale of the seven- and 10-year
securities was lower than at their last offerings, the Bank of
Spain said.  “The Fitch comment appears to have hurt Spanish bonds
today,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at WestLB
AG in London. Another reason the good auction results didn’t
boost Spanish bonds may be that the “opportunistic overselling
could be suggestive that the Tresoro is also worried about the
deficit outlook.”  Spanish 10-year bonds underperformed German bonds, with the
yield rising four basis points to 5.17 percent for a spread of
333 basis points. All other euro-region 10-year bonds
outperformed their German counterpart.  Greece ’s ’Final Phase’  Greek two-year yields climbed 35 basis points to 147.27
percent after earlier slipping 518 basis points to 165.53
percent. The price was 22.25 percent of face value.  Greece will enter the “final phase” of talks on a second
financing package with European Commission,  European Central
Bank  and International Monetary Fund representatives in Athens
tomorrow, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said.  Portuguese bonds pared declines as the European Central
Bank was said to buy the securities by two people with knowledge
of the transactions, who asked not to be identified because the
trades are confidential.  The 10-year yield was one basis point higher at 14.54
percent, after rising as much as seven basis points to 14.61
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
