“ American Idol ,” the most-watched
series on U.S. television, drew 17 percent fewer viewers to the
debut of the 11th season last night.  “Idol” attracted 21.9 million viewers, News Corp.’s Fox
network said today in an e-mailed statement, citing Nielsen
data. The show’s 18-to-49-year-old audience, a group targeted by
advertisers, slid 24 percent from the year-earlier premiere.  The show started last season with fewer viewers, only to
average a bigger audience by the May finale as fans warmed to
Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez joining  Randy Jackson  as judges.
After 10 seasons, “Idol” will average about 10 percent fewer
viewers this season, Kevin Reilly, the network’s entertainment
president, told TV critics on Jan. 8.  News Corp. (NWSA)  climbed 1.4 percent to $19.54 at 1:35 p.m. in
New York  trading . The Class A shares gained 23 percent last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
