PT Pertamina (PERT)  isn’t planning to shut
its Balongan refinery in West Java for maintenance this year as
it seeks to increase gasoline production, according to an
official at the state-run producer.  Pertamina plans to double high-octane gasoline output this
year to 1 million kiloliters, mostly from the Balongan plant,
Mochamad Harun, the company’s vice president for corporate
communications, said in Jakarta today. The Balongan plant can
process 125,000 barrels of crude a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We will have intermittent maintenance for machinery in
the plant, not a total shutdown,” Harun said. “All units in
Balongan will operate during maintenance, otherwise we can’t
boost gasoline output.”  Indonesia , Southeast Asia’s biggest oil producer, will
allow only public transportation, public-service vehicles and
motorcycles owned by low-income people to use subsidized low-
octane gasoline from April,  Evita Legowo , director general of
oil and gas at the energy ministry, said Jan. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
