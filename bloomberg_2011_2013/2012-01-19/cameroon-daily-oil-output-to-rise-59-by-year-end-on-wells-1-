Cameroon ’s daily oil production is
expected to rise 59 percent by the end of the year as output
starts at new wells, said Bernard Bahiya, director of production
at the state-owned National Hydrocarbons Corp.  “We are developing new  oil fields , notably Dissoni, that
will enable us to increase daily oil output from the present
63,000 barrels to 100,000,” he told reporters in Yaounde, the
capital.  Dissoni, discovered in 2005, is located off the coast of
the central African nation in the Rio Del Rey concession area,
according to operator Perenco SA. The state oil company, known
by its French acronym SNH, said Dissoni output will begin in
August.  Oil production in Cameroon, which borders  Africa ’s biggest
producer Nigeria, dropped to 5.6 million barrels in the third
quarter of 2011 from 5.7 million barrels a year earlier, SNH
said Nov. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
