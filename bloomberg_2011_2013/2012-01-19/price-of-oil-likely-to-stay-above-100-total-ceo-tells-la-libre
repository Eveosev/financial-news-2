The price of a barrel of oil is
likely to remain in the range of $100 to $120 this year,  Total
SA (FP)  Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said in an
interview with  La Libre Belgique  newspaper.  “The likelihood that a barrel will fall below $100 is
weak,” the newspaper quoted de Margerie as saying. “I see it
remaining in the zone of $100 to $120.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
