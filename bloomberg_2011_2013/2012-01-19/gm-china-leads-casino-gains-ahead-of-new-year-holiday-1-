MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282)  and  Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  led gains in Macau casino operators on
expectations they will benefit from more mainland China visitors
during the coming Lunar New Year holiday.  MGM China surged 8.75 percent to HK$11.68, the largest gain
since Oct. 27, at the close of  Hong Kong  trading.  Galaxy
Entertainment  rose 5.5 percent, its biggest gain since Dec. 1,
to HK$16.76. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  advanced 1.3 percent.  The week-long Lunar New Year holiday kicks off on Jan 23
and tourists from mainland China tend to boost gambling and
shopping revenue in Hong Kong and Macau during that period.  “Investors are expecting the footfall in Macau casinos to
rise during the Chinese New Year,” said Edwin Fan, an analyst
with Bank of China International in Hong Kong.  Casino revenue in Macau, the world’s largest gambling hub,
rose 25 percent in December to 23.6 billion patacas ($2.95
billion), as Chinese tourists spent more. Chinese gamblers have
fueled growth in the former Portuguese colony, where gambling
sales have more than tripled in the past four years.  Wynn Macau Ltd. climbed 2.4 percent and Melco Crown
Entertainment Ltd. added 2.2 percent.  Sands China Ltd., the Hong Kong-listed unit of billionaire
Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas-based company, advanced 3.3 percent.
 SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , Asia’s biggest casino operator by revenue,
gained 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
