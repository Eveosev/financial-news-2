Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, more than
doubled in the week through yesterday, boosted by wheat
purchases by Algeria and  Morocco .  Outbound grain shipments were 100,570 metric tons from Jan.
12 to Jan. 18, compared with 46,440 tons in the prior week, the
 Seine River port  said in an e-mailed report today. Export
cargoes included 88,550 tons of soft wheat, 8,920 tons of durum
wheat and 3,100 tons of barley.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to figures from national
crops office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
