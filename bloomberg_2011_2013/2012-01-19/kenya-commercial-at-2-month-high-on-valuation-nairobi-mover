Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (AKNCB) , the
biggest lender by outlets in the East African nation, rose to
the highest level in three weeks as investors speculated its
valuation was more attractive than peers.  The stock advanced as much as 1.25 shillings, or 7.5
percent, to 18 shillings, the third day of gains, before trading
0.6 percent higher at 16.85 shillings at the end of trading in
Nairobi, the highest level since Dec. 30.  KCB, as the bank is known, has a price-to-earnings ratio of
6.11. Equity Bank, the biggest lender by customers, is valued at
8.26 times profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It is attractive to foreign investors; what they look for
first is the most liquid counters and KCB and  Equity (EQBNK)  are the
most liquidity in the banking sector,” Francis Mwangi, head of
research at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd. said in
a phone interview. “Then in terms of valuation KCB is
cheaper.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
