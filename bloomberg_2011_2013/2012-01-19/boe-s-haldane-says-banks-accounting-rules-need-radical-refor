Bank of England official  Andrew Haldane  said fair-value accounting principles may have
exacerbated the financial crisis by allowing banks to “over
emphasize” potential returns in the years before the slump.  “Accounting rules in general, and fair value principles in
particular, appear to have played a role in both over-egging the
financial upswing and elongating the financial downswing,”
Haldane,  executive director  for financial stability at the
central bank, said in a  speech  published in London today. “They
have tended to over-emphasize return in the boom and under-
emphasize risk in the bust. That is not a prudent approach” and
“we need accounting rules for banks which are crisis-neutral,
valuation conventions for all seasons.”  Haldane made the comments in a speech delivered on Dec. 19.
He said that accounting rules for banks have “bent with the
financial stability wind” in ways which have amplified
investor and regulatory uncertainty and that a “radical”
change is needed.  Haldane said auditors need a more nuanced approach to their
reviews of banks’ balance sheets rather than being required to
issue a “clean report or not.”  “A clean verdict runs the risk of that judgment being
quickly invalidated if maturity mismatches are exposed by a
liquidity run,” he said. “But anything other than a clean
report might itself provoke that very run and hence become self-
fulfilling. A more graduated, less binary, approach
to classifying banks’ accounts may be needed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
