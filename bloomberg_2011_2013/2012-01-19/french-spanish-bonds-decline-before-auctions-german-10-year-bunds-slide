Spanish and French  government bonds 
declined as the two nations prepared to auction debt.  French bonds fell for a third day as the nation seeks to
raise as much as 9.5 billion euros ($12.2 billion) in its first
sale of medium- and long-maturity debt since losing its top
 credit rating  at  Standard & Poor’s . Greek note yields jumped to
a record as the nation began a second day of talks with private
creditors in an effort to reach an agreement to cut the nation’s
debt load. German 10-year bunds declined.  Spain ’s 10-year yields fell three basis points to 5.17
percent at 8:35 a.m. London time, before its auction of debt
maturing in 2016, 2019 and 2022.  French 10-year bonds fell for a third day, pushing the
yield one basis point higher to 3.15 percent. France is set to
sell notes due in 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The German 10-year yield was little changed at 1.80
percent. The 2 percent bund due January 2022 fell 0.105, or 1.05
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.835. The two-year yield
was little changed at 0.20 percent.  Greece ’s discussions with officials from the Institute of
International Finance, which represents bondholders, will
continue today. Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  is racing to
agree a deal, key to a second financing package, before a March
20 bond payment that will cost 14.5 billion euros.  The yield on two-year Greek notes was 427 basis points
lower at 166.44 percent after climbing 1,917 basis points to a
record 189.88 percent. The price fell to as little as 20 percent
of face value.  Bunds have returned 0.2 percent this year, after gaining
9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
French government bonds have lost 0.3 percent in 2012, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
