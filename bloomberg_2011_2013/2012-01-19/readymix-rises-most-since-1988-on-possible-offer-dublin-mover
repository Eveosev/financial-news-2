Readymix Plc (RYX) , an Irish cement
distributor, rose the most since at least 1988 after receiving
an approach from  Cemex SAB (CX)  to buy the shares it doesn’t already
own in the company for 22 euro cents each.  The shares rose 533 percent, or 16 cents, to 19 cents,
giving the company a market value of 20.8 million euros ($26.9
million).  The worst recession in Ireland’s modern history and the
ending of a decade-long housing boom weakened demand for
Readymix’s products. Sales fell in the first nine months of last
year by about 18 percent, the company said in October, adding
the “near-term outlook remains poor.”  “Cemex is the only likely buyer of Readymix,” analysts at
Dublin-based NCB Stockbrokers said in a note today. “It is the
provider of finance to the group, recently extending the credit
facility to September 2014. Mopping up the minorities would
allow Cemex greater financial flexibility.”  Discussions have commenced on the possible accord, Readymix
said today in a statement. The approach is preliminary and there
can be no certainty that an offer will be made, the company
said. Cemex owns 62 percent of Readymix, NCB said.  Readymix said it plans to release a full-year trading
update “shortly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
