French two-year notes pared a
decline after borrowing costs fell at an auction of 2014, 2015
and 2016 securities.  The two-year yield was one basis point higher at 0.77
percent as of 10:07 a.m. London time, after rising as much as
three basis points to 0.79 percent.  French 10-year bonds advanced, pushing the yield three
basis points lower to 3.11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
