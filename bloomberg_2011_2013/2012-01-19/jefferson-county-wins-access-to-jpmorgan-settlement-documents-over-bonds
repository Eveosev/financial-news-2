Jefferson County (3681MF) ,  Alabama , won
permission to review a settlement between  JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
and an investor who sued the bank for fraud related to the
county’s defaulted sewer bonds.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas B. Bennett in Birmingham
approved a request by the county to question the investor, James
R. Crane, and to review the settlement that ended his lawsuit
against JPMorgan, which underwrote the bonds. Bennett ordered
Crane to appear at the Houston offices of his  law firm  to answer
questions about the case.  The county is seeking information to use in its own lawsuit
against New York-based JPMorgan. Now that Crane has settled, the
county said it is concerned information he collected as part of
his case may be thrown away.  “If such information is discarded, destroyed or otherwise
lost, the county may be unable to obtain the documents,” the
county said in its request.  Jefferson County filed for bankruptcy in November after the
county, state officials and bondholders failed to implement a
tentative agreement to reduce its $3 billion in sewer debt by
about $1 billion, raise rates and win financial support from the
Alabama state legislature.  The case is In re Jefferson County, 11-05736-9,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham).  To contact the reporter on this story:
