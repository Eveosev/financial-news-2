Delek Real Estate Ltd. (DLKR)  climbed to
the highest level in more than five months after  Calcalist
reported  that the property company reached an initial
understanding with its Series Heh bondholders.  The  shares  gained 0.4 percent to 0.245 shekel at the 4:30
p.m. in  Tel Aviv , the highest since Aug. 14. Earlier the stock
climbed as much as 8.6 percent. The price on the 4.8 percent
bonds due in February 2019 climbed to 37.97 agorot on the
shekel, pushing the yield down 4.9 percentage points to 56.2
percent, the lowest since Dec. 13.  Delek Real Estate said in a  statement to the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange  today that no agreement had been reached with the
bondholders and that talks were continuing with their
representatives.  The Ramat-Gan, Israel-based company submitted a debt
restructuring proposal on Nov. 20 that calls for issuing new
securities to bondholders and further investments by controlling
shareholder Isaac Tshuva.  Delek Group (DLEKG)  owns 4.99 percent of Delek
Real Estate, while Tshuva owns  50.79  percent of the property
company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Delek Group shares  gained 1 percent to 802.80 shekels, the
