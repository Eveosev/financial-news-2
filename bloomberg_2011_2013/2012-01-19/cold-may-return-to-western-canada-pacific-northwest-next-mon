Frigid temperatures may return to
western  Canada  and the Pacific Northwest, while seasonal weather
comes to the East Coast at the start of February, according to
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  In his 11- to 15-day forecast, Rogers calls for seasonal
weather on the East Coast with the exception of northern New
England and the Canadian Maritimes, which may be 3 to 5 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.8 Celsius) above normal.  “In the 11-15 day, we still see building support for re-
strengthening cold air in Western Canada and the Pacific
Northwest,” Rogers said in a note to clients today from his
office in Bethesda, Maryland.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand for heating and cooling. Natural-gas
prices fell to a 10-year intraday low in  New York  as forecasts
for mild weather in the U.S. signaled a wider stockpile surplus.  Warmer than normal temperatures are expected across most of
the U.S. and Canada next week, according to Rogers and  David Salmon , a meteorologist at Weather Derivatives in Belton,
Missouri.  In his 6- to 10-day forecast, Salmon calls for average
daily temperatures to rise 6 to 10 degrees above normal across
most of the U.S. from January 25 to 29. Salmon doesn’t issue an
11- to 15-day forecast.  Rogers predicts temperatures will be 5 to 8 degrees above
normal across most of the U.S., in his 6- to 10-day forecast for
Jan. 24 to Jan. 28.  For Jan. 25, the normal average temperature in New York is
32.5, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland . In Boston it’s 29; in Chicago, 24; Atlanta, 44;
Houston, 54; Seattle, 43; and Burbank,  California , 55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
