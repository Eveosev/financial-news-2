Aluminum, the second best-performing
metal on the London Metal Exchange this year, may extend a rally
to $2,295 per ton in the next few weeks, according to  technical
analysis  by Commerzbank AG.  “Aluminum has maintained its break higher and continues to
correct higher,”  Karen Jones , a Commerzbank technical analyst
in London, wrote in a Jan. 18 report. The erosion of the
December high of $2,168 suggests an extension of the rally, she
said in a telephone interview today.  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the LME rose as
much as 1.3 percent to $2,233 a ton, the highest price since
Oct. 31, and traded at $2,228 a ton by 6:47 p.m. Seoul time.  “We believe that the market has some unfinished business
on the topside near term and we would allow for an extension of
the rally to the $2,278/95 resistance,” Jones wrote. Resistance
refers to levels where sell orders may be clustered.  Technical analysts watch for patterns on daily charts, such
as moving averages and resistance levels, for clues to price
direction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
