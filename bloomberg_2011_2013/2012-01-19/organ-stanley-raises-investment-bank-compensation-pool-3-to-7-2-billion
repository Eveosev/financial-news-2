Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, set aside $7.2 billion to pay employees at
its investment banking division in 2011, 3 percent more than a
year earlier, as the unit’s revenue climbed 6 percent.  Compensation at the institutional-securities unit, which
includes salaries, bonuses and benefits for traders and bankers,
was 42 percent of revenue, down from 43 percent in 2010 and from
56 percent in 2009, according to figures posted on the New York-
based firm’s website.  The division’s fourth-quarter pay expense fell 12 percent
from a year earlier, following rivals  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
and  JPMorgan Chase & Co .’s investment bank in lowering costs.
Morgan Stanley said last month it plans to cut 1,600 jobs.
Goldman Sachs disclosed yesterday that it eliminated 2,400
positions and reduced full-year compensation 21 percent in 2011.  “I think there’s more to come,”  William Fitzpatrick , a
Milwaukee-based financial-services analyst at Manulife Asset
Management, said on Bloomberg Television’s “InsideTrack”
before the results were released. “The industry is undergoing
some changes here, and some are more structural than cyclical.”  Companywide compensation and benefits at Morgan Stanley
rose 3 percent to $16.4 billion as revenue climbed at the same
rate. That was enough to pay each of the firm’s 61,899 employees
$264,996 on average for the year, more than the $254,596 it set
aside for each of the 62,542 employees at the end of 2010,
according to figures released today. The bank doesn’t report how
many people work in institutional securities.  Brokerage Unit  Morgan Stanley’s brokerage division, which employed 17,156
financial advisers at the end of December, down from 18,043 a
year earlier, set aside $8.35 billion for pay, 6 percent more
than in 2010. The unit’s compensation cost, which is set by a
fixed grid for many employees, was 62 percent of its revenue,
unchanged from a year earlier.  Goldman Sachs said yesterday that it reduced its
compensation and benefits expense to $12.2 billion in 2011 as
revenue slid 26 percent. The expense was enough to provide
$367,057 to each of its 33,300 employees, down from $430,700 for
each of the 35,700 workers at the end of 2010.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the biggest and most profitable U.S.
bank, reported last week that it lowered pay at its investment
bank 9 percent in 2011, enough to pay each worker an average
$341,552.  The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don’t represent individual workers’ actual pay. Investment
banks set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and
typically decide bonuses at year-end.  To contact the reporters on this story:
