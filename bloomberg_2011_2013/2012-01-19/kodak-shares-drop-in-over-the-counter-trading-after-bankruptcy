Eastman Kodak Co.’s  shares  declined
in over-the-counter trading after the photography pioneer’s
bankruptcy  filing  prompted the New York Stock Exchange to delist
the securities.  They fell 45 percent to 31 cents at 1:37 p.m. New York time
on volume of 49 million shares. The Rochester, New York-based
company’s stock symbol  changed  today to “EKDKQ” from “EK.”  Kodak started trading at the New York Stock Exchange in
April 1905, according to  data  compiled by the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
