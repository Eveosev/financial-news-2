Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said Britain may adopt technology used by  Japan ’s
Shinkansen trains on new high-speed rail lines running from
 London  to northern England.  “I want Britain to set the standard for the next
generation of high-speed rail -- for level of technology,
quality of travel and value for money,” Osborne said during a
visit to  Tokyo  today, according to remarks released by his
office in London. “Japan is the home of high-speed rail. So we
will look at all the options, including using bullet-train
technology in Britain.”  The U.K. government this month approved a plan to build a
high-speed rail link from London to Birmingham and on to
northern England. The London-Birmingham route will open in 2026
with lines to Manchester and Leeds in 2032-33. The government is
seeking private-sector and European Union funding to help meet
the 32.7 billion-pound ($50.4 billion) cost of the project.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s coalition government says
the high-speed line will boost the capacity of the U.K.’s rail
network, slash journey times and ease overcrowding on existing
lines, as well as allow northern cities better access to
London’s economy.  Hitachi Ltd. has already supplied trains using Shinkansen
technology to Britain. The Tokyo-based company’s Javelin units
provide an express commuter service to London along the High
Speed 1 line to the Channel Tunnel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
