Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri
AS (TUPRS) , which operates refineries in Turkey, plans to meet with
Saudi Arabian authorities within the month as it seeks to reduce
its dependence on Iranian oil,  Greece ’s state-run ANA news
agency said, without saying where it got the information.  Iranian threats to close the Strait of Hormuz prompted
Tupras to look for alternative suppliers, the Athens-based
agency said today. Tupras is aiming to secure supply by the
middle of this year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
