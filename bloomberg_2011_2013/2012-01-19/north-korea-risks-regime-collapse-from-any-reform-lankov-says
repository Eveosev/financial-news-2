Andrei Lankov , an associate
professor at Kookmin University in Seoul, comments about North
Korea, a month after the announcement of the death of  Kim Jong Il . He spoke in a Bloomberg Television interview.  On whether North Korea can maintain the status quo or may start
reforms:  “For the North Korean leadership, starting Chinese style
reforms means bringing disaster and collapse. Many people have
expected that North Korean leadership would sooner or later
start reforms. I have always been skeptical and now I’m more
skeptical than ever.”  “Reforms are possible. We cannot rule out the new
leadership might start reforms, because it is naive, idealistic
or just stupid. The question is whether  North Korea  is
reformable, whether a reformed North Korea is going to remain
stable.”  On whether Kim Jong Un can sustain the leadership:  “For the average North Korean, a member of the Kim family
is still a logical choice for at least a symbolic, a figurehead,
leader. I would not expect North Korean leadership including
military leadership to challenge Kim Jong Un or to depose him.”  “They need somebody from the Kim family and they need
someone who looks like Kim Jong Il and  Kim Il Sung . I don’t see
how you can get rid of such person. I don’t think he is going to
be deposed unless he starts reforms. If he starts reforms, then
military and the top government, the top party officials may
intervene. But as long as he doesn’t do anything like that, he
is personally safe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
