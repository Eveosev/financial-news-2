Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s
second-largest oil and gas producer, said fourth-quarter sales
increased 17 percent, driven by higher crude prices.  Sales climbed to $1.237 billion in the three months ended
Dec. 31, from $1.058 billion a year earlier, Perth-based
Woodside said today in a statement. That exceeded UBS AG’s
revenue estimate of about $1.12 billion.  Woodside is among companies planning as much as A$200
billion ($208 billion) of liquefied natural gas developments in
Australia to tap rising Asian demand for the fuel. Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Coleman  faces higher costs, funding
challenges and sales competition from the U.S. as he seeks to
develop more than A$70 billion in LNG ventures.  Shares of Woodside declined 1.9 percent to A$33.48 at the
close of trade in Sydney, while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index
was little changed.  Production in the fourth quarter fell 6 percent to 16.6
million barrels of oil equivalent, compared with the UBS
estimate of 15.3 million barrels. Woodside received an average
oil price of $113.80 a barrel in 2011, up 41 percent.  The company said last year it expects its Pluto LNG project
in Western  Australia  to cost A$14.9 billion, the third increase
since November 2009. Pluto’s first cargoes are scheduled for
March, six months later than Woodside expected.  “No material change is anticipated” to the scheduled
start of Pluto, Woodside said in the statement.  Woodside, seeking more gas to underpin a Pluto expansion,
said that it won’t proceed with the Xeres-1 well off Australia’s
northwest coast. Talks with other holders of gas resources to
supply Pluto are continuing, the company said. “Technical
difficulties” hindered the completion of tests at the Xeres gas
discovery, Woodside said last year.  To contact the reporter on this story: James Paton in Sydney at
