Chauncey Billups hit a 3-pointer
with one second left to give the  Los Angeles Clippers  a 91-89
win against the visiting Dallas Mavericks in a National
Basketball Association game.  Jason Terry  made a 3-pointer with five seconds left to give
the Mavericks an 89-88 lead, only to have Billups respond with
his fifth 3-pointer of the night for the Clippers at the Staples
Center in Los Angeles.  Mo Williams came off the bench to score a game-high 26
points for the Clippers (8-4), who were missing point guard
Chris Paul for the third straight game with a strained left
hamstring.  Dirk Nowitzki and Delonte West had 17 points each to lead
the Mavs (8-7).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
