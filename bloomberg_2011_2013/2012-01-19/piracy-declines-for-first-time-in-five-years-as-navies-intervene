Somali pirates seized almost 80
percent fewer ships in the final three months last year as
pre-emptive strikes by naval forces deterred attacks, a group
tracking incidents worldwide said.  Pirates from the East African country attacked 31 vessels
and captured four, the London-based International Maritime
Bureau said in a report today. They attempted 90 hijackings and
seized 19 a year earlier. Worldwide attacks fell for the first
time in five years in 2011, aided by the intervention of naval
forces, the bureau said.  Navies disrupted at least 20 so-called pirate action groups
in the final three months through pre-emptive strikes, the IMB
said. Yearly monsoons also affect the number and success-rate of
attacks. Record incidents off Somalia, the world’s most pirated
seas, have disrupted world trade because freighters using
 Egypt ’s Suez Canal must pass by Somalia to ship commodities, oil
and manufactured goods between  Asia  and  Europe .  “The role of the navies is critical to the anti-piracy
efforts in this area,” Pottengal Mukundan, IMB director, said,
adding that better management practices and the use of armed
guards also helped reduce the number of successful attacks.  A total of 439 attempts were reported worldwide last year,
compared with 445 in 2010, while pirates took 802 crew hostage
last year compared with 1,181 a year earlier, it said.  Off Somalia and in the nearby Gulf of Aden, total attacks
advanced to 197 from 192 in 2011, the bureau said. There were 13
attacks in the  South China Sea  compared with 31 a year earlier.
The number in  Bangladesh  declined to 10 from 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
