The yield on  Petroleos de Venezuela
SA ’s bonds due in 2014 fell below 13 percent for the first time
as investors move into shorter maturities on speculation the
state oil company plans to sell debt with longer maturities.  The yield on the 4.9 percent bonds fell 52 basis points, or
0.52 percentage point, to 12.79 percent today at 2:30 p.m. in
Caracas, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
1.04 cents to 82.1 cents on the dollar, a record since the bonds
were first sold in 2009.  “We just added to the short-end yesterday including 2014
bonds which we prefer over the long-end due to the potential for
supply,” said Raymond Zucaro, who helps manage and advise on
about $230 million of emerging-market corporate debt at SW Asset
Management LLC in  Newport Beach ,  California . “The short-end of
PDVSA has done so well and it’s still an attractive pick up when
you look at 10-year yields under 2 percent. It’s certainly an
outlier in terms of yield.”  PDVSA, the Caracas-based state oil company, will probably
sell $7 billion of dollar-denominated bonds this year after
raising more than $10 billion in international debt markets last
year, according to Barclays Capital analyst Donato Guarino in
 New York . Barclays has an “overweight” recommendation on PDVSA
bonds and Guarino prefers the 2014 and 2017 notes because most
of the new bond offering will probably carry longer maturities
and are relatively cheaper than Venezuelan  government bonds .  The extra yield investors demand to hold Venezuelan
government debt over U.S. Treasury bills fell 25 basis points
today to 1,201, or 12.01 percentage points, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global index. That compares to a 13
basis point drop on average for  Latin America .  The yield on  Venezuela ’s benchmark 9.25 percent bonds due
in 2027 fell 27 basis points to 13.23 percent, according to
Bloomberg data.  “The short part of the PDVSA curve is the best alternative
for investors who don’t want as much price volatility due to the
shorter maturities,” Andres Caballero, a Caracas-based bond
trader at BancTrust & Co., said in an interview. “I expect to
see more demand for those bonds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
