Dana Petroleum Plc, the U.K.
explorer acquired by  Korea National Oil Corp (KNOCPZ) . in 2010, plans to
expand in west  Africa  as it seeks to double production over the
next five years.  The company, which has assets in the North Sea,  Egypt  and
Africa, aims to produce at least 100,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day by 2016, Chief Executive Officer Marcus Richards said in an interview in  London  yesterday. The company
already has acreage in waters off Morocco, Mauritania and Guinea
and is interested in prospects along the west African coast.  “I expect we’ll have more of a balance between the U.K.
and the rest of the world,” said Richards, a former executive
at  BP Plc. (BP/)  Britain currently represents about 70 percent of the
business and the company is the second-largest holder of
offshore acreage in the U.K. after  Centrica Plc (CNA) , he said.  Dana, which operates independently from KNOC and pays its
owner a dividend, plans to invest about $1 billion a year in its
existing businesses to increase output. The company has an
untapped $900 million lending facility that it could use if it
decides to make any acquisitions, Richards said.  The Aberdeen, Scotland-based company won’t use the money to
buy production, he said. The company is interested in operating
more fields and entering new countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
