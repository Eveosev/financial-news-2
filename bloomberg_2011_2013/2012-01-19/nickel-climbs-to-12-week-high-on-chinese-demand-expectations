Nickel climbed to a 12-week high in
 London  on speculation economic growth in  China  will boost demand
for the metal used mostly in stainless steel.  Nickel for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose $658, or 3.4 percent, to $20,153 a metric ton by
5:34 p.m. local time. Prices reached $20,201, the highest level
since Oct. 25, and are above the 100-day moving average.  China’s banking regulator is weighing a plan to relax
capital requirements for lenders, delaying implementing the most
stringent capital-adequacy ratios, four people with knowledge of
the matter said. U.S. economic data also supported prices as
Philadelphia-area manufacturing expanded at a faster pace this
month.  The stainless-steel “market could witness considerable
restocking into early spring,” with better-than-expected
economic data in the U.S., “some reasonable” strength in
Japanese operating rates and “some stability in  Europe ,”
 Daniel Brebner , a Deutsche Bank AG analyst, said in a report
today. Stainless steel accounts for 65 percent of nickel usage,
according to RBS Capital Markets.  Nickel will outperform gold in the next 12 months on
“positive global cyclicality,” Brebner said. Delays to new
nickel projects may support prices, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
