Bank of Nova Scotia ,  Canada ’s third-
largest bank, is considering a sale of its Scotia Plaza office
tower, one of the largest skyscrapers in Toronto’s financial
district.  “In the current low-interest rate environment, it’s
potentially a good time to sell and we have chosen to explore
the sale of Scotia Plaza,” Scotiabank spokeswoman Ann DeRabbie
said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Toronto-based bank is at “a very early stage in the
process,” DeRabbie said. The building could sell for C$1
billion ($992.5 million), according to a report in the Globe and
Mail newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
