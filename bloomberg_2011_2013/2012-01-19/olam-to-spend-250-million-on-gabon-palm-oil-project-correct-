published Jan. 6.)  Olam Palm Gabon, a company owned by
the Gabonese government and  Singapore ’s  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) ,
is investing in a palm-oil project in the country.  Funding will be used to develop 50,000 hectares in the
central African nation and is part of $250 million in total
spending, said Gagan Gupta, general manager at Olam Gabon SA. A
report published on Jan. 5 in the Libreville-based l’Union

2013. The company said the report was inaccurate.  Olam announced the Gabon investment in November 2010,
according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
