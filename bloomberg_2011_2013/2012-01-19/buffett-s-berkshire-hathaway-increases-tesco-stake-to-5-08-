Billionaire investor Warren Buffett
increased his stake in  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  to 5.08 percent after a slump
in the share price of the U.K.’s largest supermarket chain.  Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  raised the holding from
3.21 percent and held about 407.6 million shares as of Jan. 13,
Cheshunt, England-based Tesco said today in a statement.  Tesco  shares  declined 16 percent on Jan. 12, the most since
at least 1988, after the company reported Christmas sales that
missed estimates and reined back profit expectations. Buffett
told CNBC in November he’d buy more shares if the price fell.  Tesco rose as much as 1.7 percent in London trading today
and was up 0.4 percent at 322.4 pence as of 12:33 p.m. The stock
has fallen 20 percent since the start of the year, cutting the
company’s market value to 25.9 billion pounds ($40 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
