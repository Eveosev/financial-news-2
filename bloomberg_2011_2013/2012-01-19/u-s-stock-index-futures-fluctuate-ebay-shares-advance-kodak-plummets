jobless claims plunged to the lowest level in almost four years.  Bank of America , the second-largest U.S. lender, climbed
2.4 percent. Morgan Stanley added 5.4 percent after the owner of

for the ride,” Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee about $209
billion as chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage
Funds in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, said in a telephone
interview. “A lot of the pessimism has been baked into the
cake. We’re more likely to see positive surprises.”  Of the 35 companies in the S&P 500 that reported results
since Jan. 9, 22 posted per-share earnings that  beat 
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P
500 has gained 4.5 percent so far in 2012, the most since it
rose 4.8 percent over the first 12 days in 1997, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Economic Data  Today’s rally in stocks was helped by optimism that the
 U.S. economy  will be able to weather  Europe ’s debt crisis.
Claims for jobless benefits last week dropped to the lowest
level since April 2008, pointing to an improvement in the U.S.
job market that may help bolster spending in the new year.  “We’re in a fragile economy, we’re not going to have
robust growth, but it’s going to take us a lot of things to
derail,” Richard Weeks, the Vienna, Virginia-based managing
director and partner at HighTower’s VWG Wealth Management. His
firm oversees about $20 billion. “You’ve seen big corporations
navigate through very difficult times.”  The Dow Jones Transportation Average, a proxy for the

and transportation shares added at least 1.5 percent, leading
the gains among  24 industries  in the S&P 500.  Raising Capital  Bank of America rallied 2.4 percent, the most in the Dow,
to $6.96. Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  is cutting
assets, expenses and staff while raising capital to meet demands
from regulators for a larger cushion against unexpected losses.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  climbed 5.4 percent to $18.28. Morgan
Stanley posted the only increase in trading revenue excluding
accounting gains among the five largest Wall Street banks in
2011, making progress toward Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman’s goal of boosting market share.  Union Pacific gained 2.2 percent to $112.18. Carloads
advanced 3 percent in the quarter, with auto and chemical
shipments leading gains as a strengthening recovery boosted
demand. Energy and industrial products  deliveries  also rose.  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  jumped 3.9 percent to $31.51. The largest
Internet marketplace reported sales and profit that topped
analysts’ estimates, buoyed by a campaign to promote its
expanded retail offerings and broader use of the PayPal online-
payments service.  Technology Results  Some of the largest technology companies reported results
after the market closed today.  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the biggest chipmaker, predicted revenue that
may top estimates. International Business Machines Corp., the

percent to $185.01, and Microsoft jumped 1.8 percent to $28.62
at 5:09 p.m. New York time. Google tumbled 8.5 percent to
$585.26 after the close of regular trading.  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  advanced 9.8 percent to $43.35
following a report that CIT Group Inc. will approve financing
for the retailer’s vendors as soon as today. CIT is looking for
more detailed information on Sears’s financing and may require
letters of credit for all orders, Women’s Wear Daily reported,
citing unidentified people familiar with the plan. CIT is the
largest U.S. company that provides what’s known as factoring.  Higher Forecast  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s  Andrew Garthwaite  lifted his 2012
forecast for the S&P 500 to 1,400, citing the  European Central
Bank ’s refinancing plans for banks as a “potential game
changer.” Garthwaite, the London-based global equity strategist
at the firm, had previously estimated the benchmark gauge for

the-counter trading. The Rochester, New York-based company,

 changed  today to “EKDKQ” from “EK.”  Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI)  plunged 8.8 percent to $32.46. The
