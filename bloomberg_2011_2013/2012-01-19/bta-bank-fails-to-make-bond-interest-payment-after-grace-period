BTA Bank, the Kazakh lender seeking
to restructure debt for the second time in as many years, failed
to make an interest payment on a dollar-denominated bond due in
July 2018 by the end of yesterday after a grace period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BTA may skip the $166 million coupon, which had to be paid
Jan. 18, because it has an “acute need to restore capital” and
faces the risk of a run on deposits, acting Chief Executive
Officer Askhat Beisenbayev said in Almaty the day before the
period ended. The coupon had been due on Jan. 1.  Rakhim Oshakbayev, a spokesman for the Kazakh sovereign-
wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, declined to comment on the coupon by
phone. The fund took over BTA Bank in February 2009, two months
before the lender defaulted on $12 billion of debt.  The issue is on the agenda for a Jan. 26 shareholders’
meeting, where their position will be made clear, Oshakbayev
said. Shareholders will vote on the non-payment of interest on
its bonds as well as a “moratorium on certain payments” to its
creditors, excluding depositors, according to a statement  on
BTA’s  website  on Jan. 11.  BTA Bank’s press service declined to immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
