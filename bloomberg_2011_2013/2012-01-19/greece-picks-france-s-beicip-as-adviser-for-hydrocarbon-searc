Greece  chose consulting company
 Beicip-Franlab  to advise on the country’s oil and gas
exploration, Deputy Energy Minister Yiannis Maniatis said.  A team from the company, which also acted as technical
adviser to the Cyprus government on exploration, began work at
Greece’s Energy Ministry at the start of the week, Maniatis said
at a conference today, according to an e-mailed transcript of
his comments from the Athens-based ministry.  Investor interest in exploration rights in western offshore
and mainland Greece is “substantial” and there will be “very
interesting” binding offers, Maniatis said. Bids from investors
to conduct seismic surveys in the region are  due by March 2.  Greece’s Hydrocarbon Agency is due to open next week. About
30 percent of the country’s hydrocarbon needs can be met from
domestic sources based on existing data, Maniatis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
