The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars had a fifth weekly advance as sovereign-debt sales in
 Europe  signaled the region’s fiscal crisis is being contained,
boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie gained to its strongest level in more than two
months against the greenback after France and  Spain  sold 14.6
billion euros ($18.9 billion) of bonds, with lower funding
costs. New Zealand’s dollar reached a 10-week high versus the
yen.  “Europe seems, at this early stage, to be stabilizing and
if that continues, then the Australian economy will be very
strong indeed in 2012,” said  Adam Carr , a senior economist in
Sydney at ICAP Australia Ltd., a unit of the world’s biggest
interdealer broker. “That’s why I think we’re seeing an
underlying bid for the Aussie dollar.”  Australia ’s currency traded at $1.0466 at 12:15 p.m. New
York time, after earlier reaching $1.0481, the strongest since
Nov. 1. It had a 1.4 percent weekly advance. The currency
fetched 80.53 yen, advancing for a third week.  New Zealand’s dollar traded 0.3 percent stronger at 80.54
U.S. cents, for a fifth weekly advance. It strengthened 0.1
percent to 61.97 yen after touching 62.19, the highest since
Nov. 8.  Winning Streaks  The Australian dollar’s five weeks of gains constitute its
longest winning streak since April 2011 while New Zealand’s
stretch of weekly advances is the longest since the period ended
July 29.  The European tenders yesterday were the first sale of
medium- and long-term debt since  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded
the ratings of France and Spain. S&P on Jan. 13 stripped France
of its AAA rating and cut Spain by two levels to A.  Spain has exceeded its maximum targets in all its bond
auctions since Dec. 13, and demand has strengthened since the
 European Central Bank  pumped 489 billion euros of three-year
loans into the financial system on Dec. 21.  A preliminary reading of a purchasing managers’ index for
manufacturing in China showed an increase to 48.8 this month
from a final figure of 48.7 in December, according to data
published by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. An index
above 50 means the number of manufacturers who said conditions
improved was greater than the number saying they deteriorated.  China  is Australia’s largest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-biggest export destination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
