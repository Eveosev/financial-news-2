The following is the text of
Canada's employment insurance report for Nov. released
by  Statistics Canada .  In November, the number of people receiving regular
Employment Insurance (EI) benefits totalled 539,000,
virtually unchanged from the previous month.  The number of EI beneficiaries fell in Prince Edward
Island, Ontario, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and
Labrador. In British Columbia and  Quebec , the number of
people receiving benefits rose slightly.  Number of Employment Insurance beneficiaries virtually
unchanged in November  Claims down slightly in November  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the
number of people who could become beneficiaries.  Nationally, the number of initial and renewal claims
edged down 0.8% to 238,300 in November. While claims fell
4.2% in Ontario, they increased 5.7% in Manitoba and 5.0%
in Saskatchewan. There was little or no change in the
other provinces.  Number of claims slightly down in November  Number of beneficiaries down in four provinces  Provincially, the number of people receiving regular EI
benefits in November declined in Prince Edward Island 
(-2.7%), Ontario (-1.8%),  Nova Scotia  (-1.6%) and
Newfoundland and Labrador (-1.6%). The number edged up in
British Columbia (+1.2%) and Quebec (+0.7%), while it was
little changed in the other provinces.  The decrease in Ontario continued a two-year-long
series of declines. In Nova Scotia, the number of
beneficiaries declined for the third consecutive month.  While virtually unchanged in November, the number of EI
beneficiaries in Alberta has been on a steady downward
trend since October 2009.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  EI data by sub-provincial region, sex and age are not
seasonally adjusted and are therefore compared on a year-
over-year basis.  Most large centres continue to post declines  Between November 2010 and November 2011, the number of
people receiving regular benefits fell 108,200 (-18.8%)
nationally. Declines occurred in 133 of the 143 large

population of 10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of
beneficiaries decreased in four of the five large centres.
In St. John's, the number fell 15.6%, continuing a series
of declines that began 20 months earlier.  In Prince  Edward Island , both large centres had fewer

decline in Summerside. In Charlottetown, the number of
people receiving benefits fell 10.2%.  In Nova Scotia, all five large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in November compared with November 2010,
with the largest percentage decrease in Kentville. In

year-over-year declines in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu,
Granby and Gatineau.  In Ontario, 38 of the 41 large centres had fewer

21.7%.  Demographic groups  The number of men receiving regular benefits fell 19.9%
to 268,700 between November 2010 and November 2011. The
pace of decline was similar for men under 25 years of age
(-20.1%) and those aged 25 to 54 (-20.9%). Among men aged
55 and over, the number of beneficiaries fell 16.7%.  A total of 198,700 women received benefits in November,

number of beneficiaries fell 21.0%, while for those aged
25 to 54, it was down 18.0%. For women aged 55 and over,
the number of beneficiaries declined 13.5%.  Note to readers  The change in the number of regular Employment
Insurance (EI) beneficiaries reflects various situations,
including people becoming beneficiaries, people going back
to work, and people exhausting their regular benefits.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data
sources provided by Service  Canada  and Human Resources and
Skills Development Canada. These statistics may, from time
to time, be affected by changes to the Employment
Insurance Act or administrative procedures. The number of
regular beneficiaries and the number of claims received
for October and November are preliminary. In this release,
large centres correspond to those with a population of
10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people
who received EI benefits from November 6 to 12. This
period coincides with the reference week of the Labour
Force Survey (LFS).  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.
