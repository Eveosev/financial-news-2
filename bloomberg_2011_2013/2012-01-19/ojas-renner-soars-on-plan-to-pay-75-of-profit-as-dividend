Lojas Renner SA (LREN3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest
publicly traded clothing retailer, surged to a 12-week high
after its board proposed paying 75 percent of last year’s profit
as a dividend.  The  shares  jumped 3 percent to 56.40 reais at 12:53 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo , the highest since Oct. 27. The benchmark  Bovespa (IBOV) 
index rose 0.7 percent.  Renner’s board suggested paying out 75 percent of net
income from the 2011 fiscal year to shareholders, according to
minutes released yesterday. That’s a  dividend  yield of 3.8
percent, above the firm’s 3 percent forecast and in line with
past payouts, Raymond James analysts including Guilherme Assis
wrote in a note to clients today.  “The consistency of its dividend policy over time
underscores the company’s strong management,” the analysts
said. “We see the maintenance of the payout ratio for this year
as an indication that Renner is confident that its cash flow
generation will be able to support the planned capital
expenditure budget.”  Renner is scheduled to release its 2011 results in
February. The company plans to ask shareholders to approve the
dividend at an April meeting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
