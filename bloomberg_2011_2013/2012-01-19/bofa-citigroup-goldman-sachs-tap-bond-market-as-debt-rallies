Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  and  Bank of America Corp.  tapped the corporate  bond market ,
locking in reduced borrowing costs amid a rally in their debt.  Goldman Sachs issued $4.5 billion of notes in its largest
offering since March 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. New York-based Citigroup sold $1 billion of 30-year
bonds in its first sale of the debt in more than two years,
Bloomberg data show. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S.
lender, raised $1.5 billion in an offering of 10-year
debentures.  Financial companies’ bonds are enjoying their best
performance in back-to-back months in more than a year as
investors gain confidence that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
will be contained. Even as the fourth-quarter net income at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup dropped, the average cost to
protect debt of the largest U.S. banks using credit-default
swaps has fallen to the lowest since October.  “They all want to prove they have access to the market and
fewer people are buying into a ‘woe is me’ catastrophe coming
out of  Europe ,”  Michael Johnson , chief market strategist at the
Scottsdale, Arizona-based broker-dealer M.S. Howells & Co., said
in a telephone interview. “Investment-grade financial paper is
still cheap compared to other parts of the market, and that’s
pushing some buyers toward them.”  Financial Bond Yields  Yields on financial company bonds worldwide fell to 4.55
percent yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 8, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. They have declined after
rising on Nov. 29 to 5.25 percent, the highest level since
August 2009, the index data show.  Corporate bonds issued by financial firms have returned 1.2
percent this month after gaining 2 percent in December, the best
performance in consecutive months since the period ended August
2010, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  Goldman Sachs’s $4.25 billion of 10-year, 5.75 percent
notes yield 380 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The company sold $250 million
of additional 5.125 percent notes due in January 2015 at a
spread of 350 basis points. Goldman Sachs had $2.25 billion of
the debt outstanding after a January 2005 offering, Bloomberg
data show.  Net income  in the fourth quarter decreased 58 percent to
$1.01 billion, the bank said yesterday.  The sale was Goldman Sachs’s largest since it issued $5
billion of debt guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. on March 12, 2009, Bloomberg data show.  Citigroup Offering  Citigroup’s $1 billion of 30-year, 5.875 percent bonds
yield 297 basis points more than Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. Fourth-quarter  profit  fell 11 percent, missing analysts’
estimates for an increase, to $1.17 billion as trading revenue
declined, the bank said Jan. 17.  Bank of America’s 10-year, 5.7 percent notes pay a spread
of 378 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based bank swung to a fourth-quarter profit as the
company sold assets and built capital faster than expected, it
said today in a statement. Net income was $1.99 billion compared
with a loss of $1.24 billion a year earlier.  The average of  contracts  on JPMorgan Chase, Bank of
America, Citigroup,  Wells Fargo & Co ., Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley fell to 235 basis points yesterday, the lowest since
touching 222.5 basis points on Oct. 28, according to the data
provider CMA. Credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge
against losses on the company’s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
