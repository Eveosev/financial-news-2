China ’s diesel inventories gained
the most in 10 months after refineries processed crude oil at a
record rate to meet demand for the transportation fuel,
according to a newsletter by the official Xinhua News Agency.  Stockpiles rose 10 percent at the end of December from a
month earlier, the biggest jump since February, according to an
e-mailed report from Xinhua’s China Oil, Gas & Petrochemicals.  Refineries boosted crude processing in December to 9.28
million barrels a day, exceeding the previous monthly record of
9.25 million in November, according to Bloomberg calculations of
data released Jan. 17 by the National Bureau of Statistics.
Diesel inventories reached 8.6 million metric tons, Bloomberg
calculations based on the data show.  Gasoline stockpiles rose 1.4 percent and kerosene gained
4.9 percent, while commercial crude inventories fell 2.2 percent,
according to OGP. Crude stockpiles were at 28.76 million tons in
December, according to Bloomberg calculations.  OGP stopped publishing specific stockpile levels in July
2010. Inventory levels calculated by Bloomberg News are based on
percentage changes that OGP provides monthly and volumes given
by the publication up to July 2010.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
