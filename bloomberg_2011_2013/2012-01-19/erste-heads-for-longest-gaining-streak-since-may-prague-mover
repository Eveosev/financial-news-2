Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  increased to its
highest in more than two months in Czech trading after Chief
Executive Officer Andreas Treichl said the Vienna-based bank
will reach a new capital ratio requirement of 9 percent by June.  The shares jumped 5.7 percent to 367.9 koruna at the end of
trading in Prague, its highest close since Nov. 14, leading a
1.7 percent rally for the  PX (PX)  company gauge. In Vienna, Erste’s
home market, the stock surged 7.3 percent to 14.65 euros.  A possible rating downgrade of Erste by  Standard & Poor’s 
after Austria lost its AAA status last week will have “little
effect” on the company, Treichl told reporters yesterday in
Prague. Central and eastern  Europe  is well-placed to weather the
euro area’s debt crisis and grow in years ahead, Treichl said,
adding he sees growth opportunities for Erste across the region.  Financial companies led global stocks higher after Bank of
America Corp. published a profit. Spanish and French borrowing
costs fell in auctions, a sign of easing in the euro-area’s debt
crisis, and a U.S. report showed jobless claims in the world’s
largest economy fell to a four-year low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
