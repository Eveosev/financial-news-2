Ethanol rebounded from a four-week
low as corn increased on signs of more export demand.  Futures rose 0.9 percent after the Agriculture Department
reported that exporters sold a combined 264,700 metric tons of
corn, the primary ingredient in U.S. production of the biofuel,
to Mexico and  South Korea .  “Corn finally had a little reversal here and the people
that were sitting on the sidelines decided to buy some ethanol,
too,” said Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk
Management in Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for February delivery advanced 1.9 cents
to $2.131 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
yesterday settled at $2.112, the lowest level since Dec. 19.
Futures have slipped 7.9 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slid 1.5
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.205 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive increased 0.5 cent to $2.215, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  Chicago  climbed 0.5 cent to $2.105 a gallon and
on the West Coast the biofuel rose 0.5 cent to $2.22.  Corn for March delivery increased 12.5 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $6.06 a bushel in Chicago. One such unit makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
