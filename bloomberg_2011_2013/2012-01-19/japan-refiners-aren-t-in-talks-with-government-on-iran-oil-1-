Japanese refiners haven’t started
talks with the government on cutting imports of Iranian crude
after the U.S. imposed sanctions on the country, the head of
Japan’s oil industry association said.  “We aren’t in talks with the government at the moment,”
Akihiko Tembo, chairman of  Idemitsu Kosan Co. (5019)  and the Petroleum
Association of Japan, told reporters in Tokyo today.  The Japanese government signaled support for U.S. efforts
to cut imports of Iranian oil as senior U.S. officials including
U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  visited Tokyo.
Japan, the second-biggest importer of Iranian crude after  China ,
will probably be forced to cut purchases from the country as
banks may stop doing business with the  Central Bank  of Iran to
avoid penalties from the U.S., Tembo said.  “No matter what the Japanese government says, we can’t
keep doing business with Iran, once banks pull back on
transactions,” Tembo said. “Japanese refiners are probably
trying to reduce and replace Iranian oil imports with other
sources as a realistic approach.”  The U.S. and its allies say  Iran  is trying to develop
nuclear weapons, a claim the country denies. The sanctions are
aimed at cutting off Iran’s main source of income to force the
government to abandon its atomic program.  To contact the reporters on this story:
