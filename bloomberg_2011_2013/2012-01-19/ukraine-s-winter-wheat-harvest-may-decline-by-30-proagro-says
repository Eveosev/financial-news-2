Ukraine’s winter wheat harvest may
decline by 30 percent this year compared with 2011 after drought
weakened plants, agriculture researcher ProAgro said, citing
Tetiana Adamenko, head of the national weather center’s agro-
meteorology department.  Even under the best-case scenario, the harvest will be at
least 20 percent to 30 percent lower, Kiev-based ProAgro said in
a statement e-mailed yesterday, citing Adamenko.  Farmers will have to prepare significant areas for re-
seeding, ProAgro cited her as saying.  Ukraine’s farmers may have to replant as many as 3 million
hectares (7.4 million acres) of grain in the spring, Agriculture
Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said last month, after a three-and-
a-half month drought damaged plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
