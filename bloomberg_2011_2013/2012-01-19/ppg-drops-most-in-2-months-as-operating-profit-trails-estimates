PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) , the world’s
second-largest paint maker, fell the most in two months after
posting fourth-quarter operating profit that trailed analysts’
estimates.  PPG fell 2.8 percent to $87.41 as of 10:38 a.m. in  New York 
after trading as low as $86.81, the biggest drop since Nov. 17.  Operating income -- sales minus the cost of goods sold,
administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization -- was
$307 million, Pittsburgh-based PPG said today in a statement.
That’s less than the $344.8 million average of five analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 4.1 percent from a
year earlier to $3.52 billion as sales volumes were unchanged.  Net income climbed 5.4 percent to $216 million, or $1.39 a
share, from $205 million, or $1.24, a year earlier, PPG said.
The average of 14 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was
$1.27 a share.  The 12-cent beat was aided by a lower-than-expected  tax
rate  and a favorable tax settlement that added 17 cents a share
to earnings, Ivan A. Marcuse, a Cleveland-based analyst at
Keybanc Capital Markets Inc. who rates the shares “buy,” said
in a report today.  Akzo Nobel NV is the world’s largest paint maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
