Tenaris SA (TS) , the world’s largest
maker of seamless steel pipes, said it agreed to buy all shares
it still doesn’t own in  Brazil ’s  Confab Industrial SA (CNFB4)  in a
public offering to delist the company from the Sao Paulo stock
exchange.  Tenaris will offer 5.85 reais per share of Confab, a maker
of steel tubes, which would value the transaction at as much as
1.4 billion reais ($792 million), the company said in a
statement yesterday after the market closed.  The offer is 13 percent higher than the 5.20 reais per
share Tenaris proposed on Aug. 29. On Nov. 3, Tenaris said it
had withdrawn its offer for Confab shares and there would be no
second valuation after shareholders requested a “substantially
higher offer.”  Tenaris shares rose 0.3 percent yesterday to 15.54 euros in
Italian trading. The shares have gained 8.8 percent this year.  Confab shares fell 0.9 percent yesterday to 4.60 reais. The
shares have gained 12.2 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
