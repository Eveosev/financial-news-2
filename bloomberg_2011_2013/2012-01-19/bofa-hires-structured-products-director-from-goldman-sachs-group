Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a
unit of  Bank of America Corp. , hired a structured product
specialist in  Tokyo  from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   Yuichiro Shinozaki joined the bank this month as a director
in charge of developing and structuring equity investments,
Tsukasa Noda, a spokesman in Tokyo at Merrill Lynch Japan
Securities Co., a unit of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
lender, said by phone today.  Miyako Takebe, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo,
declined to comment on staff moves when reached by phone today.  Bank of America also hired Masahiro Oshige, previously at
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , as a managing director in charge of
equity product sales, Noda said.  Isamu Kajino, a spokesman for Credit Suisse in Tokyo, said
in an e-mail today that Oshige had been head of equity
derivatives before leaving the firm last year.  Shinozaki and Oshige started with Bank of America on Jan.
4, Noda said.  With these two hires, Bank of America wants to strengthen
its structuring capabilities for clients including third party
distributors, according to Noda.  Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are
contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
