The efforts of German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s party to avert new elections in the state of
Saarland by sharing power with the opposition Social Democrats
failed, the  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  said.  Merkel’s  Christian Democrats  have sought new partners in
the state, one of Germany’s smallest, after a coalition with the
Free Democrats collapsed this month. CDU state Prime Minister
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said she would seek an alliance with
the SPD to hold on to power.  The efforts crumbled today, DPA reported, citing comments
made by Kramp-Karrenbauer and SPD leader Heiko Maas in the
state’s capital Saarbruecken. Their respective press departments
didn’t return calls to confirm the talks failed.  The collapse of the coalition in Germany’s smallest state
that isn’t one of three cities highlights Merkel’s own woes with
the FDP, her partner in the federal coalition. Voter support has
slumped for the business-friendly FDP to below 5 percent, the
threshold for qualifying for parliament in national elections.  Germany ’s next national election is due in the fall of
2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
