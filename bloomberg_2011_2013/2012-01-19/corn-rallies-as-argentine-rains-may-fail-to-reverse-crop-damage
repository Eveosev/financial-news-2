Corn rose from a four-week low in
 Chicago  on speculation rains forecast in Argentina, the world’s
second-biggest exporter, may fail to reverse crop damage.
Soybeans climbed.  Rains in Argentina this week that helped ease stress on
crops won’t reverse damage from months of hot, dry weather, said
Christopher Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in  London .
The effect on corn is “irreversible” in the country, said
Esteban Copati, an agronomist at the Buenos Aires Cereals
Exchange.  “The rains can’t offset some of the damage,” Gadd said by
phone today. “They can only stop it from getting any worse.
Only time will tell.”  Corn for March delivery gained 0.6 percent to $5.9725 a
bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The grain yesterday reached $5.925, the lowest price since Dec.
19.  Soybeans for delivery the same month advanced 0.9 percent
to $11.945 a bushel. The oilseed last week touched $11.50, the
lowest price since Dec. 21.  “It’s getting to a critical stage for soybeans,” Gadd
said. “The weather still looks dry on the six- to 10-day
outlook for  Argentina .”  Wheat for March delivery increased 0.5 percent to $5.955 a
bushel. Milling wheat for March delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 0.1 percent to 197.75 euros ($255.25) a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
