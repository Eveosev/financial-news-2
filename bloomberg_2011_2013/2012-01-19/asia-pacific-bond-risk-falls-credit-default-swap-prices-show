The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment fell,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index declined 4 basis points
to 169 as of 11:35 a.m. in Sydney, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc prices show. The gauge is on track for its lowest close
since Oct. 31, 2011, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 3 basis points to 197.5 as of
8:35 a.m. in  Singapore , RBS prices show. The measure is set for
its lowest close since Dec. 7, according to CMA, which is owned
by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index decreased 1.5 basis point to
181 as of 9:35 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
