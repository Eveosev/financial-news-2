TNK-BP (TNBP) , the Russian oil venture
owned by BP Plc and a group of billionaires, plans to increase
output at two mature fields in the Orenburg region after adding
five wells this year.  Buguruslanneft, one of the company’s oldest units in the
region, will drill two wells at the Novo-Mikhailovskoye field
and three at Krasnoyarskoe, boosting oil output at the deposits
by 20 percent from 2011, TNK-BP said today in a  website 
statement.  Production at Novo-Mikhailovskoye started in 1999, while
Krasnoyarskoe pumped its first oil in 1956. TNK-BP is Russia’s
third-largest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
