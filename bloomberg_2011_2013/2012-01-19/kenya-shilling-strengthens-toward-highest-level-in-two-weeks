Kenya ’s shilling appreciated, set
for the strongest closing level in more than two weeks, as the
 central bank  removed cash supply in the market.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.6 percent to 85.68 per dollar and traded 0.2 percent
higher at 86 at 1:52 p.m. in Nairobi. A close at that level
would be the highest since Jan. 3.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 225 million shillings
($2.6 million) of bids for the 5 billion shillings of  repurchase
agreements  it offered at 18 percent, a bank official, who
declined be identified in line with the bank’s policy, said by
phone today from Nairobi.  Tanzania’s shilling appreciated for the first time in five
days against the dollar as the central bank sold dollars in the
market. The currency of the second-largest East African economy
climbed 0.3 percent to 1,590.00 at 1:57 p.m. in  Dar es Salaam .  “Today we have seen some intervention from the central
bank selling dollars to support the shilling,” Hakim Sheik, a
trader with Commercial Bank of Africa Tanzania Ltd., said by
phone from the commercial capital.  Uganda ’s currency appreciated for the third day, gaining 1
percent to 2,400 per dollar in Kampala.  “The shilling has rallied because of tight liquidity in
the interbank as they are short of the local currency and
diminished demand of the dollar from the oil importers and
manufacturing sector,” Dickson Musoni, a currency trader at
Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said by phone from Kampala.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
