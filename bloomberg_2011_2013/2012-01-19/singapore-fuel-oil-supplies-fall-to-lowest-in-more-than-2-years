Singapore â€™s  fuel-oil  stockpiles fell
to the lowest level in almost two and a half years, data from
the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
dropped 6 percent to 15.33 million barrels in the week to Jan.
18,  International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the ministry,
said in an e-mailed statement today. Supplies are at the lowest
since July 29, 2009.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  such as gasoil and
kerosene decreased 5.6 percent to 9.93 million barrels.  Light
distillates (SPIVLDIS) , a category that includes naphtha, reformate and
gasoline, increased 4.3 percent to 11.05 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
