Florida (STOFL1)  should consider making its
12th state university completely online, a top state Republican
legislator said today.  Florida would be the first state to create such a program,
said Andrew Magda, a senior analyst at Eduventures, Inc., a
Boston-based higher education research company. Magda said that
while several states have partnered with private companies to
offer online courses and degrees, none have tried to start their
own college.  State Representative Will Weatherford today is asking the
Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the state university
system, for a cost-benefit analysis of creating a state-
subsidized online university. Weatherford is the designated
House speaker in 2013-2014 if Republicans maintain their
majority after the November elections. Republicans in  Florida 
have controlled the House since 1996.  “There is no doubt that such a delivery model is the wave
of the future,” Weatherford wrote in a letter to Dean Colson,
chairman of the Board of Governors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
