Players at Turkish soccer club MKE
 Ankaragucu , bottom of the country’s premier league, are being
fed by supporters and equipped by the government as the Ankara
team struggles to pay off debt.  Lawmaker Aylin Nazliaka said today she’s donating a month’s
salary to the 102-year-old club to help with what she said are
“astronomic debts,” the state-run Anatolia news agency said.
Sports Minister Suat Kilic this week announced the government
will provide equipment sponsorship, after the team had to play
in sodden shirts in the second half of a snow-swept match in
Sivas, central  Turkey , because players didn’t have spare
uniforms. Ankaragucu lost 3-0.  The club also accepted a van full of meat, vegetables and
fruit donated on Jan. 17 by supporters, Anatolia said.
Ankaragucu needs about 200,000 liras ($110,000) to support the
club through the end of this season, Nazliaka said.  Debts amount to 95 million liras and all revenue is being
claimed by creditors, former Chairman Cemal Aydin said today.
Aydin said he’s quitting the club and won’t extend his three-
year battle for control with the city’s mayor, Melih Gokcek,
according to a statement on Anatolia.  The club has only three professional players because others
have quit after not being paid, Nazliaka said. Ankaragucu may
field youth team players this weekend when they play local rival
Genclerbirligi in the Ankara derby.  Ankaragucu has 11 points from 20 matches, compared to
Galatasaray, leader of the 18-team Super League, which has 46.  To contact the reporter on this story:
