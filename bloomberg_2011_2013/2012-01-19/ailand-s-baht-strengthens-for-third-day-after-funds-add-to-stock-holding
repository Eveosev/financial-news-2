Thailand ’s baht advanced for a third
straight day and  government bonds  gained after international
investors raised holdings of the nation’s assets on optimism
growth in Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy will quicken.  Global funds bought $91 million more Thai equities than
they sold in the first three days of the week, according to
exchange data.  Gross domestic product  may rise 7 percent this
year, incoming Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said on Jan.
15. The  finance ministry  estimates the economy expanded 1.1
percent last year. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks climbed
after the  International Monetary Fund  said it plans to boost its
lending resources to counter Europe’s debt crisis.  “Fund inflows are among the major factors influencing the
baht so far this week,” said Norawit Suparinayok, a foreign-
exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “Most investors don’t have
confidence in European countries for now and so the current
better sentiment may only be temporary.”  The baht appreciated 0.2 percent to 31.71 per dollar as of
3:12 p.m. in Bangkok and touched 31.67 earlier, the strongest
level since Jan. 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency may trade between 31.50 and 31.85 for the rest of
this week, Norawit said.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent notes due June
2017 declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
3.09 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  International investors purchased a net $112 million of
local notes in the first three days of this week, according to
the Thai Bond Market  Association (TBTVFCNV) .  To contact the reporter on this story:
