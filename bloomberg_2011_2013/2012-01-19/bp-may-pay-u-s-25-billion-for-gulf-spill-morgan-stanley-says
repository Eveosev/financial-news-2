BP Plc (BP/) , the operator of the Macondo
well that caused the worst U.S. oil spill in the  Gulf of Mexico 
in 2010, may reach a settlement with the U.S. for as much as $25
billion, Morgan Stanley said.  The company and the  Department of Justice  will probably
agree on a sum of $20 billion to $25 billion before the trial
scheduled to start on Feb. 27, analyst Martijn Rats said in a
note published today. The figure, which includes civil charges,
criminal penalties and fines under the  Clean Water Act , exceeds
the $12 billion that BP set aside for these costs, he said.  BP took about $40 billion in charges related to the April
20, 2010, blowout on the Deepwater Horizon  rig  and set up a $20
billion fund for victims of the spill. The higher-than-expected
cost of a settlement will prevent BP from raising its dividend,
Rats said.  The result of the trial, “would be particularly uncertain
and difficult to predict,” Rats wrote in the note. “Given the
large amounts involved, we believe both BP and the DoJ will find
the associated risk unattractive.”  A settlement will probably come after BP announces fourth
quarter results on Feb. 7, Rats said. BP has already settled
with four of the six other companies involved in the spill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
