Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said financial markets are undervaluing some European
 government bonds  and not giving enough credence to budget cuts.  “Progress in the various countries can be seen, in Ireland
for example, but also in Italy, where the new government is
going to implement fiscal measures,” Dombret said in a speech
in  Abu Dhabi  today. “European sovereigns deserve more
confidence than markets are currently willing to give them.”  France will seek to raise as much as 9.5 billion euros
($12.8 billion) today in its first sale of medium and long-term
debt since it lost the AAA credit rating at Standard & Poor’s
last week. Europe’s debt crisis has prompted the International
Monetary Fund to seek to boost its lending capacity by as much
as $500 billion, and the Washington-based lender is pushing
nations such as  China , Brazil and oil-exporting countries to
step up their contributions.  “Global players can help to solve the current crisis in
Europe,” Dombret said. The Bundesbank official is attending a
seminar hosted by the  Central Bank  of the United Arab Emirates.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is due to speak at
a press conference with U.A.E. central bank Governor Sultan Bin Nasser Al-Suwaidi at 1 p.m. Frankfurt time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
