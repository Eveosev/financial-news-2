Endemol NV (EML) , the Dutch producer of
the “Big Brother” TV shows, said a majority representing more
than two-thirds of its lenders have agreed “in principle” on
restructuring about 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in debt.  “Without the constraints of an onerous  capital structure ,
we will be able to pursue exciting growth initiatives,”
President Marco Bassetti and Chief Financial Officer Just Spee
said in a statement today.  The company will continue talks in coming weeks to finalize
documents for the restructuring, Endemol said. Charlie Gardner,
an Endemol spokesman, declined to elaborate.  Endemol last month received a $1.3 billion all-cash offer
from  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  It was taken over in 2007 by  Mediaset
Espana Comunicacion SA (TL5) , Cyrte Fund II BV,  Mediaset SpA (MS)  and
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
