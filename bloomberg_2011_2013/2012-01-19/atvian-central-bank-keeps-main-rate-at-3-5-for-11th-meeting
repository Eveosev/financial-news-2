Latvia’s central bank left its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for an 11th meeting as the
Baltic nation’s economic recovery gathered pace.  Latvijas Banka  held the refinancing rate at 3.5 percent,
Governor Ilmars Rimsevics said today at a news conference in the
capital, Riga.  The  economy  grew a preliminary 5.7 percent from a year
earlier in the third quarter, the quickest pace in almost 4
years, as private consumption, manufacturing and exports
increased. Latvia completed its 7.5 billion-euro ($9.6 billion)
lending program from a group led by the European Commission and
the  International Monetary Fund  in December.  The refinancing rate affects the minimum interest rate on
central bank swaps and repurchase agreements, worth about 75
million lati ($137.6 million) a week. The bank runs a quasi-
currency-board system, where lati in circulation are backed by
foreign currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
