The  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  said
it will remove by September a provision in spring-wheat futures
contracts that requires delivery of only U.S. grain.  The exchange received approval from the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission to make the change, MGEX said today
in a  statement  on its website. Plans for the change were first
announced in August, when MGEX indicated the requirement would
be lifted no later than May 2013.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) , a rival exchange, plans to
offer milling-wheat, durum and barley contracts in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, starting Jan. 23. Canadaâ€™s Conservative government
passed a law last month ending the marketing monopoly held by
the Canadian Wheat Board in Western Canada since 1943.  To contact the reporter on this story:
