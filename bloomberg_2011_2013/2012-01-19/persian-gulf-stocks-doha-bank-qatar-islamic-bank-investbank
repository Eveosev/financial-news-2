declining 2.9 percent to 63 riyals. Full-year earnings of 1.24
billion riyals ($341 million) at Qatar’s third-largest bank by
total loans met analysts’ estimates. The bank also said it may
sell bonds as early as this quarter to raise $500 million or
more.  InvestBank PSC (INVESTB)   climbed the most in more than
two weeks, rising 6.3 percent to 1.7 dirhams. The Sharjah,

billion riyals at the Persian Gulf country’s biggest Shariah-
