ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM)  concluded a
contract with Warner Bros. studios to show films including
“Superman,” the “Harry Potter” series and the “Lord of the
Rings” trilogy,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing Ruediger Boess,
the company’s purchasing chief.  The agreement takes effect in 2013 and will replace showing
rights so far held by Bertelsmann AG’s RTL unit, ProSieben’s
biggest German rival, the newspaper said. The price may be
higher than 100 million euros ($129 million), Handelsblatt
added, citing analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
