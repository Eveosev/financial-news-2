Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , Austria’s former
telephone monopoly, said investor Ronny Pecik’s RPR
Privatstiftung holds 20.118 percent after exercising  call
options .  RPR’s Marathon Zwei Beteiligungs GmbH exercised call
options to buy 22,593,000 shares, or 5.1 percent, of Telekom
Austria, the Vienna-based company said in a statement late
yesterday. Marathon already held 15.004 percent and RPR directly
holds 0.015 percent of Telekom Austria.  The network operator said on Jan. 16 that RPR held 5.1
percent of call options exercisable until June 18. RPR has been
progressively building the stake since acquiring options to buy
5.4 percent of the company’s rights in October.  Pecik, who said in October that he teamed up with Egyptian
billionaire  Naguib Sawiris  to buy a stake in  Telekom Austria ,
told Format magazine on Dec. 16 that he was aiming for 25
percent of Telekom Austria.  Telekom Austria, which owns mobile networks in seven
eastern European countries, halved its 2011 and 2012 dividend
forecasts on Dec. 16, after Pecik criticized the company’s
payout policy. Pecik may call an extraordinary shareholder
meeting in March, Die Presse reported Jan. 18, without saying
where it got the information.  The Austrian government owns 28.4 percent of Telekom
Austria and is its biggest shareholder.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
