France  and  Spain  sold 14.6 billion
euros ($18.8 billion) of bonds, with both nations’ funding costs
falling in the first sale of medium and long-term debt since
 Standard & Poor’s  downgraded their ratings.  France sold 7.97 billion euros of notes, just short of its
maximum target, with the average yield on the benchmark two-year
notes sliding to 1.05 percent from 1.58 percent in October.
Spain sold 6.61 billion euros in bonds maturing in 2022, 2019
and 2016, more than its maximum target of 4.5 billion euros. It
issued debt due 2022 at an average of 5.403 percent, down from
6.975 percent in November.  The sales came after S&P on Jan. 13 stripped France of its
AAA rating and cut Spain by two levels to A. Spain has exceeded
its maximum targets in all its bond auctions since Dec. 13, and
demand has strengthened since the  European Central Bank  pumped
489 billion euros of three-year loans into the financial system
on Dec. 21.  “They are both good strong auctions,”  Padhraic Garvey ,
head of developed markets debt strategy at ING Bank NV in
Amsterdam, said in an interview. “Spain is showing the market
there’s ample demand for their paper. The result is perfectly in
line with the sentiment we’ve see over the past couple of weeks.
The ECB measures obviously help.”  The demand for Spain’s 2022 bond was 2.17 times the amount
sold, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.54 in November.
For the French sale it was 2.4, in line with 2011 sales.  Sliding Yields  France’s benchmark 10-year bonds yielded 3.09 percent at
11:09 a.m. London time, down from 3.13 percent on Dec. 5, when
S&P warned of a rating cut. Borrowing costs fell on Jan. 16 at
the French sale of 8.59 billion euros in bills, the first after
the downgrade.  The Spanish 10-year  benchmark  yields rose to 5.25 percent,
compared with 5.14 percent yesterday. They reached a 14-year
high of 6.78 percent on Nov. 17.  Spain’s funding costs for four-year paper rose from an
auction one week ago, even as demand increased. The 2016 debt
yielded an average of 4.021 percent, up from 3.912 percent on
Jan. 12. Demand for those notes was 3.24 times the amount sold,
compared with 1.71 times last week.  France also sold 425 million euros of 10-year inflation
linked bonds for an average yield of 1.07 percent, down from
2.32 percent on Nov. 17.  Investor demand is being stoked in part by the ECB, which
has injected euros into the market by offering loans in so-
called long-term refinancing operations, or LTROs. The ECB
awarded 489 billion euros of three-year loans to 523 banks on
Dec. 20, and banks in the region can use that cash to snap up
government debt, investors said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
