UBS AG (UBSN)  plans to raise $1.5 billion
in the first dollar-denominated sale of covered bonds from a
European borrower in four months, said a banker involved in the
deal.  Switzerland ’s largest bank may price the three-year notes
to yield 135 basis points more than the benchmark mid-swaps
rate, said the banker, who declined to be identified before the
deal is completed. Sweden’s Nordea Bank AB was the last issuer
of the securities when it priced $1 billion of 2016 notes on
Sept. 15, UniCredit SpA data show.  Banks have issued a record 42.7 billion euros ($55 billion)
of covered bonds so far this year compared with 41.2 billion
euros in the same period a year earlier, Bloomberg data show.
Covered bonds are backed by mortgages or public sector loans,
and guaranteed by the issuer.  Barclays Capital , HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and Scotia Capital are managing the deal with UBS, the
banker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
