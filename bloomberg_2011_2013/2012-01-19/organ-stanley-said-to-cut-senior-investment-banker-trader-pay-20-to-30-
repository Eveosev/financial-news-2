Morgan Stanley (MS)  is reducing pay for
senior investment bankers and traders by an average of 20
percent to 30 percent for 2011 as it seeks to curb mounting
compensation costs, people with knowledge of the decision said.  The cuts affect employees on the executive director level
and above, one of the people said, declining to be identified
because the pay policy isn’t public. Some bankers were informed
this week, two of the people said.  Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman , 53, vowed after
taking over in 2010 to shrink the portion of revenue devoted to
paying employees after the ratio reached 62 percent the previous
year. Excluding accounting adjustments and one-time items,
revenue at the New York-based company’s investment-banking
 division  fell about 2 percent last year.  The unit’s compensation expenses rose 3 percent, according
to figures released today. Deferred pay awarded in previous
years helped boost costs in 2011, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview. Mark Lake, a spokesman for the bank,
said he couldn’t comment on pay decisions.  Banks worldwide have been cutting and deferring
compensation and overhauling policies for clawing back payouts
to traders and investment bankers over the past two years as
firms succumb to revenue and regulatory pressures in the wake of
2008’s financial crisis.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said yesterday that discretionary
compensation declined “significantly more” than the firm’s
annual revenue, which dropped 26 percent.  Deferred Payouts  Bonuses, which are awarded early in the year for the
previous year’s performance, make up a large portion of total
pay for Wall Street employees.  Morgan Stanley, owner of the world’s largest brokerage,
told staff this month that it’s capping immediate cash bonuses
at $125,000 as the firm defers a greater share of awards to
senior executives, a person briefed on the plans said earlier
this week.  That decision will increase the average amount of pay
deferred to about 75 percent, the person said. That’s up from an
average of 60 percent in 2010 and 40 percent in 2009. Deferred
cash for 2011 performance will be paid out in two equal
installments in the final month of 2012 and 2013, a change from
the previous deferral plan that paid out in thirds over 18
months, the person had said.  Average Payouts  Companywide compensation and benefits at Morgan Stanley
rose 3 percent to $16.4 billion as revenue climbed at the same
rate. That was enough to pay each of the firm’s 61,899 employees
$264,996 on average for the year, more than the $254,596 it set
aside for each of the 62,542 employees at the end of 2010,
according to figures released today. The bank doesn’t report how
many people work in institutional securities.  Goldman Sachs reduced its compensation and benefits expense
21 percent to $12.2 billion in 2011. The expense was enough to
provide $367,057 to each of its 33,300 employees, down from
$430,700 for each of the 35,700 workers at the end of 2010.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest and most profitable U.S.
bank, reported last week that it lowered pay at its investment
bank 9 percent in 2011, enough to pay each worker an average
$341,552.  Average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don’t represent individual workers’ actual pay.  To contact the reporters on this story:
