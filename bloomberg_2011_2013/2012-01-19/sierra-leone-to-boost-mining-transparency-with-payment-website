Sierra Leone  wants to improve
transparency in its burgeoning mining industry by publishing
revenue online, said Mines and Mineral Resources Minister
Minkailu Mansaray.  “The extractive sector is projected to improve government
revenue considerably both this year and beyond,” he said in
Freetown, the capital, today. “This requires transparency on
the part of government.”   The  website  shows payments made by large and small miners
and the status of licenses and applications. It shows London
Mining Plc, which expects to start iron-ore shipments this
month, paid $450,000 in September and Koidu Holdings SA, a
diamond producer, paid $200,000 on Jan. 11.  Sierra Leone is the first country in West Africa with an
online repository, according to Jonathan Siaka, a director in
the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
