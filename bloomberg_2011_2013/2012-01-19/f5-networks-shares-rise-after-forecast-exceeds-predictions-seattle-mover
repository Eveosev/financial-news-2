F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV) , a maker of
equipment for managing data traffic, posted its biggest one-day
gain since October after the company’s profit and sales
forecasts beat analysts’ estimates.  Second-quarter earnings will be $1.05 to $1.07 a share,
excluding some items, the Seattle-based company said yesterday.
Sales will be $332 million to $337 million in the period, which
ends March 31. Analysts had estimated $1.05 in profit and $330.9
million in revenue, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  F5’s so-called application-delivery controllers go into
data centers to prevent Internet gridlock and enhance security.
The company’s hardware products are withstanding a challenge
from server software, which attempts to provide similar
features, said Matthew Robison, an analyst at Wunderlich
Securities Inc. The company showed it can improve profit margins
despite the increased competition, he said.  “Peers may be getting traction with software/server-based
application delivery controllers, but for the traditional
customer base of F5, purpose-built hardware continues to
deliver,” Robison said in a report. He now expects  F5 shares  to
reach $120, up from a previous target of $110. Robison
maintained his “hold” rating.  F5 shares  jumped 12 percent to $121.83 at 12:59 p.m. in  New
York , the biggest gain since Oct. 26. The stock, which had
fallen 18 percent last year, climbed as high as $122.63 earlier
in today’s session.  Annual Sales  Demand for its equipment will help fuel sales growth of at
least 20 percent this year, F5 said yesterday, reiterating an
earlier forecast. The company plans to hire more than 125
workers in the current quarter.  F5’s fiscal  first-quarter earnings  also beat estimates. Net
income in the three months ended Dec. 31 rose 19 percent to
$66.5 million, or 83 cents a share, from $55.7 million, or 68
cents, a year earlier.  Excluding some items, Earnings were $1.03 a share. Sales
rose almost 20 percent to $322.4 million. Analysts had estimated
profit of $1.01 a share and revenue of $319.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
