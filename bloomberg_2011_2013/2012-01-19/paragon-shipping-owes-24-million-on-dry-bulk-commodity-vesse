Paragon Shipping Inc. (PRGN) , a Marshall
Islands-incorporated owner of 16 vessels that haul dry-bulk
commodities, owes $24 million on one of its carriers, the
Friendly Seas.  The amount owed, which is as of Sept. 30, is less than the
$36.6 million listed in a company filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission on Dec. 31, 2010, Robert J.
Perri, the company’s Athens-based financial officer, said by e-
mail yesterday. Paragon said Jan. 17 the vessel’s charterer
asked to change the hire terms of a $33,750-a-day contract
scheduled to expire in 27 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
