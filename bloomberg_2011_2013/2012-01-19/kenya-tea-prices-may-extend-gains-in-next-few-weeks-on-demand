Tea prices at auction in  Kenya , the
world’s biggest exporter of the black variety of the leaves, may
extend gains in the next few weeks on seasonal demand, according
to the East Africa Tea Trade Association.  Frost this month caused “minimal damage,” Peter Kimanga,
chairman of the association, said in a phone interview today
from Mombasa. The average tea price at the Mombasa auction
yesterday was $2.74 a kilogram (2.2 pounds).  “The high prices are demand driven,” Kimanga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
