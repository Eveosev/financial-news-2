Mexico ’s peso advanced for a fourth
day as better-than-forecast U.S. economic data boosted the
outlook for the Latin American country’s exports.  The peso strengthened 0.7 percent to 13.2210 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close in Mexico City, from 13.3089 yesterday.
Today’s closing level was the currency’s strongest since Oct.
28. It has appreciated 5.4 percent this year.  Increasing optimism about the economic outlook for the
U.S., the destination for 80 percent of Mexican exports, is
helping drive the peso’s gains. A U.S. Federal Reserve report
this week showed New York-region manufacturing expanded by more
than forecast and at the fastest pace in nine months. U.S.
jobless claims plunged to the lowest level since April 2008 in
the week ended Jan. 14, Labor Department figures showed today.  The U.S. economic data “is giving the markets a little
more tranquility,” Omar Martin del Campo, head trader at Banco
Ve Por Mas SA in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview.
“Whatever piece of data that pushes the  U.S. economy  helps us
in the same way.”  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
6.33 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
of the securities, known as Mbonos, rose 0.59 centavo to 132.31
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
