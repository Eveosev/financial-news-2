Greece ’s money managers saw a 25
percent increase in the value of net outflows from mutual funds
in 2011 compared with 2010, the  Hellenic Fund and Asset
Management Association  said.  Equity assets managed were negatively affected by a 60
percent drop last year in the level of the Athens Stock
Exchange’s FTSE/ASE 20 large-cap index, the Athens-based group
said in an e-mailed statement today. Equities accounted for 22
percent of total mutual-fund assets and bonds for 23 percent.  The total value of UCITS mutual funds stood at 5.2 billion
euros ($6.7 billion) at the end of December, down from almost 8
billion euros at the end of 2010 and 5.9 billion euros at the
end of the third quarter, according to the statement.  Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable
Securities, or UCITS, is a regulated European fund format that
allows managers to invest in derivatives, according to the
European Commission’s website.  The total value of assets managed by the association’s 35
members, including real-estate and closed-end funds, declined to
8.55 billion euros as of Dec. 31 from 9.6 billion euros on Sept.
30, the association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
