Yale University  ended the longest
winning streak in intercollegiate sports history when it
defeated top-ranked  Trinity College  5-4 in men’s squash,
breaking a 252-match winning streak that dated back to February
1998.  The No. 2 Bulldogs (7-0), runners up to the Bantams in each
of the last two national championship matches, rallied late to
defeat their in-state rivals at Brady Squash Center on Yale’s
campus in New Haven,  Connecticut , yesterday. No. 1 Trinity (8-
1), located 40 miles away in Hartford, has won 13 consecutive
national championships over the 14-year, 252-match span.  “It’s hard to put into words, this group has been trying
for four years to break through,” Yale coach Dave Talbott said
on the school’s athletics website. “A lot of the guys were here
tonight, guys who graduated and laid the foundation, but this
team -- especially the seniors -- wanted this so bad.”  Yale trailed 4-3 after the first seven matches went final,
and rallied with victories from seniors Robert Berner and  John
Roberts . Berner won first, and Roberts closed the match with a
10-12, 11-7, 11-7, 5-11, 11-4 victory over Trinity’s Johan
Detter.  Yale, 2-0 in Ivy League competition, is yet to face No. 3
 Princeton University  or No. 5  Harvard University .  Trinity’s unbeaten streak was the longest streak in the
history of college athletics, according to the school’s
athletics website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
