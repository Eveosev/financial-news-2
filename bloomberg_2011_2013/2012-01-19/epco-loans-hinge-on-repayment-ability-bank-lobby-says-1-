Fresh loans for  Tokyo Electric Power
Co. (9501) , the operator of the stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant, depend on the utility’s repayment ability and forthcoming
business strategy, the head of  Japan ’s banking lobby said.  Tokyo  Electric’s business plan scheduled for release in
March “should include what kind of financial support it needs
from banks,”  Katsunori Nagayasu , chairman of the Japanese
Bankers Association, said at a news briefing in Tokyo today.  The utility known as Tepco is in talks with banks to borrow
as much as 2 trillion yen ($26 billion) to help avoid bankruptcy
as it compensates survivors of the nuclear disaster and
decommissions reactors, two people with knowledge of the
discussions said this month. Meltdowns at the plant after last
March’s earthquake and tsunami led Japanese utilities to resort
to loans for funding as they were unable to sell bonds, a trend
that Nagayasu expects to continue.  “The  bond market  probably won’t accept utilities’ issuance
for the time being,” said Nagayasu, who is also chief executive
officer of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest
publicly traded bank. “That’s because of uncertainty over
nuclear power policy and power rate hikes. Banks will have to
continue to meet utilities’ financial needs with loans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
