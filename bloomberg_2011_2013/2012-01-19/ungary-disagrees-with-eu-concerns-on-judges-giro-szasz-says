Hungary disagrees with the European
Commission on the lowering of the mandatory  retirement age  for
judges, over which the European Union has threatened a lawsuit,
government spokesman Andras Giro-Szasz said.  The commission is “fundamentally wrong” to consider the
lowering of the retirement age for judges to 62 years from 70
years as “early retirement” as 62 years is now the general
retirement age, Giro-Szasz told M1 state television today.  “Hungary will negotiate and if there is no agreement in
the end, then the case goes to the European court,” Giro-Szasz
said. “Obviously, if the Hungarian government presents its
reasons next to the European Commission’s reasons, then the two
sides will accept each others’ reasons.”  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  told European Parliament
members in Strasbourg,  France  yesterday that he is ready to
compromise on disputed laws as he seeks to revive bailout talks
with the EU and the  International Monetary Fund .  The EU and the IMF suspended the talks last month after
Orban refused to compromise on a central bank legislation the EU
and IMF said may undermine monetary policy independence. The
European Commission has also cited concerns about the overhaul
of the data-protection authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
