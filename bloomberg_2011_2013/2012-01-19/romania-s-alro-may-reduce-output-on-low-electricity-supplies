Romanian aluminum smelter  Alro SA (ALR) 
may temporarily halt some production, lowering total capacity,
or restructure operations as power supplies from hydropower
generator Hidroelectrica SA falter.  Alro, majority owned by  Vimetco NV (VICO) , is trying to avoid an
output cut as Hidroelectrica is only providing about 50 percent
of needed electricity, forcing the smelter to buy the rest from
the overnight market at much higher costs, the company said
today in a filing to  Bucharest Stock Exchange .  “We are focusing now on maintaining the activity,” Alro
Chief Executive Officer Gheorghe Dobra said in the statement.
“We are confident that we’ll find an acceptable solution
regarding the electricity supplies, and we’ll be able to
implement our long-term development strategy in  Romania .”  Alro plans to build its own gas-fired power plant with a
total capacity of 250 megawatts after it received financing from
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other
commercial banks, the company said. The company completed the
first step in selecting general contractor for the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
