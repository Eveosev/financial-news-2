Debt in the U.S. private sector
could return to sustainable levels within two years, according
to a report by McKinsey & Co. that concludes deleveraging is
proving less aggressive elsewhere in the world economy.  Debt in the U.S.’s financial and corporate sectors has
dropped to levels last seen in 2000, while U.S. households have
reduced what they owe relative to income by 15 percentage
points, the report said today.  Progress in cutting the debt overhang has been more limited
elsewhere with McKinsey’s research division estimating total
debt has grown across the world’s 10 largest advanced economies
since the financial crisis of 2008. Government liabilities have
led the increase with the ratio of debt to gross domestic
product declining in only the U.S.,  South Korea  and  Australia .  “Understanding the interplay between deleveraging and
growth can help policy makers and business leaders steer the
proper course as their national economies continue to recover
from the financial crisis,” said Charles Roxburgh, a London-
based director of the McKinsey Global Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
