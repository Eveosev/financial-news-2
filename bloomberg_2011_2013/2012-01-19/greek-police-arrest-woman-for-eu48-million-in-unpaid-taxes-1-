Greek police arrested a 35-year-old
woman in Thessaloniki,  Greece ’s second-largest city, for non-
payment of taxes amounting to 48 million euros ($62 million), in
an effort to clamp down on tax evasion.  The woman operated a clothing company between 2006 and
2010, according to a statement released on the police force’s
 website .  Greece’s government has been stepping up efforts to fight
tax evasion, by arresting citizens that owe taxes. Total unpaid
taxes amount to 42 billion euros, according to a statement
released on Sept. 8 by the Greek Finance Ministry.  On Dec. 28 a 70-year-old man was arrested in  Athens  by the
Greek police for unpaid taxes that amounted to 1.1 million
euros, while a 47-year-old man was arrested on Dec. 12 for non-
payment of 7 million euros.  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said Oct. 18
Greece had to step up the fight against  tax evasion  “which will
help heal society’s wounds”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
