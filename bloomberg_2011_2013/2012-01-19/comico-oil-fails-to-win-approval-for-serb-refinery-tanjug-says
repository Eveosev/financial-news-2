Comico Oil, the Serbia-based unit of
U.S.-Dutch Comico Overseas, failed to secure consent by local
authorities in Smederevo to build a $250 million refinery,
 Tanjug  news agency reported, citing a local official.  After more than three years of negotiations and efforts to
overcome local opposition over environmental concerns, the
company did not receive approval for a proposed 99-year lease
for a 113 hectare (280 acre) lot for the facility, the report
said, citing Brance Stojanovic, the head of the local assembly,
after a vote late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
