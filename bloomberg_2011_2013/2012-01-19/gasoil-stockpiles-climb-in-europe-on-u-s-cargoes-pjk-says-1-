Gasoil stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, rose after two consignments arrived from the U.S.,
according to PJK International BV.  The inventories increased 15.4 percent to 2.12 million
metric tons in the week to today, the highest level since Dec.
1, according to PJK, a researcher in the Netherlands. Shipments
also arrived from  Canada  and  Russia .  “They were big cargoes of diesel quality,” Pieter Kulsen,
founder of PJK, said by phone from Brega. “Recently, the
backwardation turned into contango so this gives incentive to
store,” he said.  The contango, where later-dated deliveries are more
expensive than near-term supplies, was at $1.50 a ton, the most
since early August. The reverse is known as backwardation.
Gasoil for March traded at $948.50 a ton on  London ’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange while the contract for February was at $947.  Gasoline (ARASGSLN)  stockpiles advanced for a third week, rising 4.2
percent to 746,000 tons amid supplies from Denmark, France,
Germany,  Poland  and the U.K., PJK data show. That’s the most
since May 5. Product was shipped to  China  and  South Africa .  Naphtha (ARASNPHT)  gained 13 percent to 53,000 tons on imports from
Russia, PJK said.  Fuel oil  climbed 45 percent to 814,000 tons on consignments
from Poland and Russia, PJK said. That’s the highest level since
Nov. 17. A very large crude carrier was expected to sail on Jan.
22 for  Singapore , the data showed.  Jet fuel  declined 2.2 percent to 479,000 tons even as
supplies arrived from the  United Arab Emirates .  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
