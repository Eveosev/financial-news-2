Oil traded near a one-week low after
gasoline stockpiles rose and consumption fell to the lowest in
10 years in the U.S., the world’s biggest crude consumer.  Futures were little changed in  New York  after slipping 0.2
percent yesterday. While crude inventories declined, gasoline
use dropped to the  lowest  since September 2001, and supplies of
the motor fuel increased to the highest level in 10 months,
according to a report yesterday from the Energy Department. U.S.
demand for oil products in the latest four-week period was down
7.2 percent from a year ago, according to  Societe Generale  SA.  “This is an ominous sign for the  U.S. economy ,”  Mike Wittner , head of oil market research at Societe Generale in New
York, said in a report dated yesterday. “Gasoline fundamentals
remain weak. The market is anticipating firmer future
fundamentals due to Atlantic Basin refinery closures. We are
skeptical.”  Oil for February delivery was at $100.50, up 11 cents, in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:53
a.m. Singapore time. The contract, which expires today, declined
20 cents yesterday to $100.39, the lowest settlement since Jan.
13. The more-active March contract advanced 27 cents to $100.81
today. Prices are 1.8 percent higher this week.  Brent oil for March settlement was at $111.98 a barrel, up
43 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The
European benchmark contract’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
futures was at $11.17, compared with $11.01 yesterday and a
record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Fuel Consumption  Hovensa LLC said this week it will shut its St. Croix
refinery in the  U.S. Virgin Islands  by mid-February because of a
downturn in fuel demand. The 350,000 barrel a day plant is the
largest plant to shut in at least a decade because of a downturn
in fuel demand and increased international competition.  U.S. gasoline consumption dropped 2.2 percent to 8 million
barrels a day last week, the lowest since the week ended Sept.
21, 2001, when it slid to 7.8 million barrels, according to data
from the Energy Department. Motor  fuel stockpiles  rose 3.72
million barrels last week to 227.5 million, the highest since
the week ended March 4. They were forecast to rise 2.35 million
barrels in a Bloomberg News survey.  Crude inventories declined 3.44 million barrels last week,
the Energy Department data showed. They were estimated to climb
3 million barrels, according to the median of 12 analyst
estimates in the Bloomberg News  survey . Distillate supplies, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, rose 438,000
barrels compared with a projected gain of 1.375 million barrels.  U.S. imports fell 17 percent to 8.3 million barrels a day,
the lowest since the week of Dec. 16, according to the Energy
Department report. Refineries ran at 83.7 percent utilization
during the week, the lowest since the week of Nov. 4, the data
showed.  ‘Bearish Bias’  “Prices sold off on weak refinery utilization and import
demand,” according to a report from The Schork Group Inc.,
energy analysts based in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “We are not
feeling bullish after the DOE data and maintain our bearish
bias.”  Refinery closures worldwide by the middle of the year,
coupled with increased crude production from  Libya , will lead to
a “better-supplied oil market” in the Atlantic Basin,  Olivier Jakob , managing director of Petromatrix GmbH, said in a report
yesterday. The basin, which includes northwest Europe and the
U.S., will have 3 million barrels a day more as Libya resumes
pumping 1.2 million barrels and refinery halts remove 1.8
million barrels a day of crude processing capacity, he said.  Crude may rise next week on speculation an economic
recovery in the U.S., the world’s top oil consumer, will boost
demand, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Eighteen of 40 analysts, or 45 percent, forecast oil will
advance through Jan. 27. Fifteen respondents, or 38 percent,
predicted prices will drop and seven estimated there will be
little change. Last week, 50 percent of surveyed analysts
expected a decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
