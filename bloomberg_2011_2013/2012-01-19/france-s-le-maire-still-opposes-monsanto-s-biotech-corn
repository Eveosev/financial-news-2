corn variety is insect-resistant.)  France  still opposes the growing of
genetically-modified corn from  Monsanto Co. (MON)  in the country,
French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire said.  The corn opposed by Le Maire is MON 810, an insect-
resistant variety that is modified to be poisonous to pests
including the European corn borer.  “I continue to oppose cultivation of Monsanto 810 on
French soil,” Le Maire told reporters at a conference in Dijon
in eastern France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
