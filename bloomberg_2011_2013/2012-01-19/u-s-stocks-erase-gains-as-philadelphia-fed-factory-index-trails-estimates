U.S. stocks erased gains after a
Federal Reserve gauge of manufacturing in the Philadelphia area
trailed economists’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,308.31 at 10:05 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as 0.4
percent earlier.  The Philadelphia Fed’s general economic index increased to
7.3 in  January from 6.8 last month. Readings greater than zero
indicate expansion in the area covering eastern Pennsylvania,
southern  New Jersey  and Delaware. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News forecast the gauge would rise to 10.3, according
to the median roecast.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
