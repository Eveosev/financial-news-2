The European Commission said that as
many as eight Hungarian radio licenses may have been withdrawn.  “We have learned in recent days that there may be up to
eight licenses that have been withdrawn,” Ryan Heath, a
spokesman for the commission, told reporters today in Brussels.
“That doesn’t in itself mean that the authorization directive
has not been complied with,” he said.  “So we have yet to establish that there has been a failure
to comply with the authorization directive,” Heath said. “But
the trend is obviously quite concerning. It goes beyond the non-
renewal of the license in Budapest. It suggests to us that there
may be problems with media pluralism and media freedom in
 Hungary ,” he said.  “We have been following the Klubradio situation very
closely,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
