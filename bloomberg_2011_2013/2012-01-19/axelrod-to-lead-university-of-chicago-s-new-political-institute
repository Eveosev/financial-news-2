The University of  Chicago  plans to
open an Institute of Politics next year and has named political
strategist  David Axelrod  as its inaugural director.  The institute, which will cater to students seeking careers
in public service and the nonprofit industry, will begin
offering programs on the campus in Chicago’s Hyde Park
neighborhood in early 2013, the university said today in a
 statement .  Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President  Barack Obama 
who left the administration to lead Obama’s re-election effort,
will start his new position after the election.  The institute will offer public lectures with policy
makers, connect students with leaders at the Harris School of
Public Policy Studies and tap into an existing network of
fellowships and internships for students around the world,
according to the statement.  “My goal is to introduce more students to the spirit of
public service,” Axelrod said in the statement. “To me, it’s
the most exciting, interesting and vital way to spend one’s
life, and it’s a tremendous way for students to have an impact
on the issues they care about.”  Informal discussion with students showed a strong desire
for the program, Axelrod, a 1976 graduate of the university,
said in the statement.  The  University of Chicago , founded in 1890, has more than
15,000 students. Among its alumni are economist  Milton Friedman ,
author Saul Bellow, former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft
and astronomer Carl Sagan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
