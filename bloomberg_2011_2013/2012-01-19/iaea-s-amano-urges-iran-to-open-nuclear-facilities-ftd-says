International Atomic Energy Agency
Director General Yukiya Amano urged  Iran  to open its nuclear
program to inspectors who plan to visit the country this month,
the Financial Times Deutschland quoted him as saying in an
 interview .  The Vienna-based United Nations nuclear-monitoring agency
wants access to anything that may have a military dimension,
Amano was quoted as saying in the German newspaper today.  Iran hasn’t helped clear up suspicion surrounding its
nuclear program and what is known suggests it is working on an
atomic bomb, Amano was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
