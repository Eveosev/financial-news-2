Bell Equipment Ltd. (BEL)  closed at its
highest in more than three years on expectations the South
African manufacturer of handling machinery will report a surge
in earnings for the year through December.  The stock rose 5 percent to 21 rand in Johannesburg, a
sixth day of gains and its highest close since October 2008.  Bell’s adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal 2011 are
expected to rise to 2.48 cents from 0.27 cents a year earlier,
said Hugan Chetty, an analyst with Johannesburg-based Afrifocus
Securities.  “It’s the positive results that are going to come out,”
Chetty said in a mobile-phone interview from  Cape Town . “Market
conditions have improved and there’s improved activity in the
mining sector. It’s also better stock management, pricing and
volumes.”  South African mine production rose 11.2 percent in November
after declining 8.2 percent the previous month, Statistics South
Africa said on Jan. 17. Year-on-year production fell 4.6
percent, less than the 9 percent decline estimate of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the Pretoria-based agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
