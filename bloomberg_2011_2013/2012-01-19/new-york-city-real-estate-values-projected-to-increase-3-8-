The value of  New York City ’s more
than 1 million properties may rise 3.8 percent to $845.4 billion
this fiscal year as the real estate market recovers, according
to a projection by the city Finance Department.  Commercial properties, including Manhattan’s signature
office towers, will gain the most, with a 7.9 percent increase
to $222.7 billion, according to the tentative  assessment  for
fiscal 2013. “Market forces” -- changes in supply and demand -
- accounted for more than half that increase, the Finance
Department said today in a statement.  A jump in assessed property values increases the amount of
money New York City can  borrow , as set forth in the state
constitution. The city can owe as much as 10 percent of a five-
year average of the value of its taxable properties. For fiscal
2012, that was $76.1 billion. The amount is projected to
increase to $77.8 billion in fiscal 2013, to $79.5 billion in
2014, and $81.2 billion by 2015.  Residential buildings with more than three units will rise
5.2 percent in assessed value, according to the city’s forecast.
Average tax bills paid by property owners in that category,
which includes rental apartments and most condominiums, would
increase $195.77 to $4,150.60, the Finance Department said. For
single-, two- and three-family homes, plus condos in buildings
of three stories or fewer, the projected gain was 3.1 percent,
with a tax increase of $119.02 to $4,082.  Manhattan  will have the largest rise in market value, 5.9
percent, according to the city’s report. Following are the
Bronx, with a projected gain of 3.6 percent;  Brooklyn , 3.2
percent; Queens, 2.2 percent; and  Staten Island , 0.7 percent.  Major Office Buildings  The city estimated 111 Eighth Ave. in Manhattan, the almost
3 million-square-foot (279,000-square-meter) industrial building
that Google Inc. bought in 2010, would increase 17 percent in
taxable value, the most among 16 “major” office properties
included in the report. The value would rise 15 percent at the
Seagram Building, 13 percent at the General Motors Building and
15 percent at 666 Fifth Ave.  New York City commercial-property prices rose 6 percent on
a per-square-foot basis in 2011, Massey Knakal Realty Services
said in a report on Jan. 17. Retail properties and elevator
apartment buildings in Manhattan increased the most -- 37
percent and 30 percent, respectively. Office values climbed 22
percent, the New York-based brokerage said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
