(Corrects story yesterday to show Yahsi is CEO of Albaraka
Turk, not Asya Katilim in the second paragraph.)  Turkey ’s Islamic banks gave most
loans to construction companies and will continue lending to
Turkish firms this year, Sabah reported.  The industry awarded 14.8 billion liras ($8 billion) of
loans to constructors as of November, 6.5 billion liras to trade
and retail companies and 3.8 billion liras to textile firms, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said citing Fahrettin Yahsi, chief
executive of  Albaraka Turk Katilim Bankasi AS (ALBRK)  and head of an
association representing the banks.  Islamic banks increased their lending by about 20 percent
last year, Yahsi said. Total loans, including personal loans,
were 38 billion liras at the end of November, he said. The banks
are committed to lending money without changing the loan’s terms
before maturity, Yahsi said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
