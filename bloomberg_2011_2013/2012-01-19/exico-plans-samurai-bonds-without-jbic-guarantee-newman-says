Mexico ’s government will seek to
sell Japanese yen-denominated debt without a guarantee from the
 Japan Bank for International Cooperation , said Juan Pablo
Newman, the country’s deputy director general of debt issuance.  The government may have to sell a smaller amount with a
shorter maturity than the so-called Samurai bonds it previously
sold with the JBIC guarantee, he said at a conference held by
LatinFinance today in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
