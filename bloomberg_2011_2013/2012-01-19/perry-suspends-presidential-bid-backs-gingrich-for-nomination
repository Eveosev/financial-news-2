Texas Governor Rick Perry suspended
his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and
endorsed former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich .  “There is no viable path forward for me in this 2012
campaign,” Perry said. “I believe Newt is a visionary
conservative who can transform our country.”  Perry, who has lagged below 10 percent in public opinion
polls since the New Hampshire primary, made his announcement in
South Carolina, site of the next primary election Jan. 21.  Backing Gingrich, Perry said Republicans need to replace
President Barack Obama “with a conservative leader who will
bring about real change.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
