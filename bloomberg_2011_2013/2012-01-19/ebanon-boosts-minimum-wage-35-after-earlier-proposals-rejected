Lebanon agreed to raise the minimum
wage by 35 percent, the first increase since 2008, after more
than three previous proposals were rejected by unions or an
advisory committee.  Prime Minister  Najib Mikati ’s government agreed late
yesterday to boost the wage to 675,000 Lebanese pounds ($448) a
month, Information Minister Walid Daouk said in a statement on
the premier’s  website .  The General Labor Confederation and other organizations
said earlier they weren’t satisfied with previous proposals
endorsed by the cabinet for wage increases of 40 percent to 74
percent. The agreements were held up after opposition from some
cabinet members and an advisory committee.  Lebanon’s last minimum wage increase was in 2008 when it
rose 67 percent, the first raise since 1996. Yesterday’s
decision must be reviewed by the advisory council and published
in the Official Gazette before it takes effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
