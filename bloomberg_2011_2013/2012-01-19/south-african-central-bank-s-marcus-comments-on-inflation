South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus made the following comments on inflation today after
a meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee in  Pretoria .  “Inflation is now expected to remain above the upper end
of the target range for an extended period but there is no
evidence of significant demand pressure in the economy.  ‘‘The inflation forecast of the bank has been subjected to
a further upward revision.  ‘‘Inflation is now expected to remain outside the upper end
of the target range for the whole of 2012 and to peak in the
second quarter of 2012 at around 6.6 percent, before declining
gradually and returning to within the target range in the first
quarter of 2013.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
