Qatar ’s benchmark index tumbled to
the lowest close almost three months after  Qatar Islamic Bank (QIBK) ’s
full-year earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  Qatar Islamic, the Persian Gulf country’s biggest Shariah-
compliant lender, slumped 3.1 percent.  Doha Bank QSC (DHBK)  fell for a
sixth day after reporting 2011 profit in line with expectations.
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  declined 1.1 percent to 8,461.77, the lowest
since Oct. 25, at the 1 p.m. close in Doha. The measure
retreated 2.7 percent  this week .  “Banks earnings are weighing on the Doha bourse and
disappointed some investors as Qatar Islamic missed estimates
and Doha Bank was in line,” said Samer Darwiche, a Dubai-based
analyst at Gulfmena Investments. He said investors were “highly
anticipating” results of lenders in Qatar, which had the
world’s fastest-growing economy for a second straight year in
2011, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  Qatar Islamic, the company with the  fourth-heaviest 
weighting on Qatar’s benchmark stock index, said net income for
2011 was 1.37 billion riyals ($376 million) compared with 1.26
billion riyals a year earlier. The  mean estimate  of eight
analysts was for a profit of 1.46 billion riyals, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock fell the most since March
14 to 80.3 riyals. The shares rose 4.7 percent  last year .  Doha Bank shares dropped 2.9 percent, the most since Oct.
4, to 63 riyals. Qatar’s third-largest bank by total loans
posted an 18 percent rise in 2011 profit, and may increase the
size of a $500 million bond it plans to sell as early as this
quarter, Chief Executive Officer  Raghavan Seetharaman (BHSEASI)  said.  About 6.1  million shares  traded in Qatar today, compared
with a 12-month daily average of 7.8 million.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  retreated 0.3 percent and
Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  slipped 0.2 percent. Dubai’s  DFM General
Index (DFMGI)  dropped 0.3 percent. Kuwait’s  gauge  was little changed
while Bahrain’s BB All Share Index gained 0.4 percent and  Abu
Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  advanced 0.2 percent. Saudi Arabia’s
market is closed for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
