Burundi ’s lawmakers rejected a bill
that would result in high-ranking government officials, such as
ministers and parliamentarians, paying taxes on their salaries,
National Assembly Chairman Pie Ntavyohanyuma said.  “The assembly rejected the bill because there are some
contradictions with the laws that already exist in Burundi,”
Ntavyohanyuma said in a speech in the capital, Bujumbura,
yesterday.  Gabriel Rufyiri, head of the anti-corruption advocacy group
OLUCOME, said the rejection of the bill may undermine foreign
donors’ confidence in Burundi.  “Our fight is not ended,” Rufyiri said in a telephone
interview today. “We will go on calling senior officials to pay
taxes like small civil servants who still pay while they are not
well paid.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
