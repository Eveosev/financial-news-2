German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  will present a plan for a
growth and competitiveness fund, the  Handelsblatt  newspaper
said, citing an unpublished six-point paper.  The money for the euro-area facility would come from
existing European Union funds for less developed regions that
weren’t fully exhausted last year, the German newspaper reported
today. Merkel and Sarkozy will present the paper at the Jan. 30
EU summit, according to Handelsblatt.  The two leaders also seek to accelerate tax harmonization
in the EU, the newspaper said, citing energy taxes, a financial
transaction tax and the assessment base for corporate taxes.
Germany and  France  will present a proposal by the end of
February to streamline their corporate tax systems, it said.  Merkel and Sarkozy also said that new bank liquidity rules
shouldn’t go into effect before 2014 and new debt limits
shouldn’t become effective before 2018, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
