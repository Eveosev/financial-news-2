  Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS (FROTO) , the
Turkish unit of  Ford Motor Co. (F)  in partnership with  Koc Holding
AS (KCHOL) , expects to produce 288,000 vans this year, fewer than the
record 296,000 it built in 2011.  Ford aims to export 212,000 of the vans during 2012, chief
executive officer Nuri Otay said at a news conference in
Istanbul today. The company will sell 128,000 cars and vans in
Turkey this year, he said.  Ford Otosan will build a new plant in Eskisehir to produce
small vans, Otay said.  Exports totaled $3.5 billion in 2011, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
