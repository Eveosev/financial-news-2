Singapore  may displace  Hong Kong  as
Asia’s hub for synthetic exchange-traded funds due to regulatory
changes, Boston-based financial research and consulting firm
Celent said in a report.  The market in Singapore for the investments, which produce
returns through derivative contracts rather than through
underlying securities, may rise to $5.5 billion by 2014 from $1
billion, Anshuman Jaswal, Celent’s Bangalore, India-based
analyst covering financial services, said by e-mail on Jan. 17.  Hong Kong may shrink to $4.5 billion in the same period
from $8 billion, if the city’s Securities and Futures Commission
“comes down strongly” on the funds, Jaswal said. The regulator
last year  announced  new requirements on synthetic ETFs
incorporated in the city to increase transparency and protection
for investors.  Societe Generale SA’s Lyxor Asset Management plans to
delist all 12 of its Hong Kong-listed synthetic ETFs in March,
Herman Chen, the company’s head of ETF distribution in  Asia ,
said by phone in Hong Kong today. Lyxor announced its intent in
December. The decision was not in reaction to the new
regulations, Chen said.  “It is possible that trading volumes are insufficient to
make Lyxor’s ETFs cost-effective in light of the new measures,”
Celent said it its Jan. 12 report. The company is part of the
Oliver Wyman Group, a management consulting firm.  Lyxor has 26 synthetic ETFs in Singapore. It plans to add
two this quarter, and possibly list more later this year, Chen
said.  ETFs in Asia  Hong Kong has 70 ETF listings, while Singapore has 44,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of today. Synthetic
funds account for 11 percent of the $100 billion ETF market in
the Asia-Pacific region, according to the report.  Apart from Hong Kong and Singapore, markets in the region
do not have a high level of synthetic ETF activity, according to
the report. Two such funds in  Australia  were converted to
regular ones after coming under pressure from regulators, and
the Japanese and Korean markets are dominated by regular ETFs,
it said.  Deutsche Bank AG and Lyxor are the main synthetic ETF
providers in the area, according to the report.  Recent Approvals  The Hong Kong regulator approved six Deutsche Bank
synthetic ETFs at the end of 2011, the first in 18 months. Soon
after, it sanctioned seven from Enhanced Investment Products
Ltd., a Hong Kong-based asset manager.  “It would be difficult to say that Singapore will overtake
Hong Kong” due to the recent authorizations, said Johnny Yu,
managing director for equity derivatives sales at UBS AG, in a
telephone interview Jan. 16.  While the differences in regulations between the two Asian
cities are not big, Hong Kong is stricter, Marco Montanari, the
head of Deutsche Bank’s ETF business in Asia, said in a
telephone interview on Jan. 17.  In Hong Kong, the funds must have zero counterparty risk,
meaning that investors’ money has to be completely secured in
case a derivative provider goes bankrupt, Montanari said. “In
Singapore you can have up to 10 percent counterparty risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
