Cofinoga, a French consumer-credit
venture of  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  Galeries Lafayette SA (GL) , may be

Bertail, the secretary of the works council.  The business has been hurt by slowing economic growth and a
law aimed at protecting individuals from taking on too much
debt, the paper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
