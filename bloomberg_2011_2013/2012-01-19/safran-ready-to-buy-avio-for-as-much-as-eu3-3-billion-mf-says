Safran SA (SAF)  is ready to pay as much as
3.3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) for Italian aerospace company
Avio SpA, newspaper MF reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Safran, advised by  Mediobanca SpA (MB) , has started an antitrust
review, after which it would start a due diligence process,
according to the Italian newspaper. Safran may offer eight times
the Italian company’s earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to beat  CVC Capital Partners  and
 Italy ’s strategic fund, MF reported.  --  To contact the reporter on this story:
