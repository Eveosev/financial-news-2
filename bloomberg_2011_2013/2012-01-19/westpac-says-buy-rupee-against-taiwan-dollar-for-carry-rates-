Analysts at Westpac Banking Corp.,
including  Robert Rennie , Sydney-based chief currency strategist,
recommend buying India’s rupee against the Taiwan dollar. The
comments were published today in a research note.  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 50.285 against the  U.S.
dollar  as of 12:19 a.m. in Mumbai, taking this month’s gain to
5.6 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It gained
4.3 percent since Dec. 31 against the Taiwanese currency.  “The rupee continues to strengthen as the Indian
government does more to encourage capital inflows and the risk
of stagflation recedes somewhat.  ‘‘The dollar has already fallen a long way against the
rupee and the better way to play long-rupee may be through
shorting the Taiwanese dollar against the rupee, which offers
very attractive carry rates.  ‘‘Next week sees the  Reserve Bank  of India decision on
Tuesday, with inflation pressures still too strong to warrant a
rate cut just yet.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
