BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, said it’s started developing
infrastructure at its 75 percent-owned coal project in  Borneo 
after receiving regulatory approvals.  The work at the IndoMet Coal project includes  road
construction  and associated infrastructure for future mine
development, Kelly Quirke, a spokeswoman for the Melbourne-based
company, said by telephone today.  “Regulatory permits and approvals that we need for the
initial road works are now in place,” Quirke said. “Those
early works have now begun.”  The project in Kalimantan on Indonesia’s part of Borneo
island could start production in the year ending June 2016,
according to a BHP  presentation  in September. The basin has the
potential to support large-scale metallurgical and thermal-coal
output and the first development at Lahai will provide the
initial operating platform and development of transport
infrastructure, it said.  The IndoMet project spans East and Central Kalimantan
provinces, with an estimated 774 million metric tons of coal
resources, according to the  website  of PT Adaro Energy, the
Indonesian partner, which paid $335 million for a 25 percent
stake in the project in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
