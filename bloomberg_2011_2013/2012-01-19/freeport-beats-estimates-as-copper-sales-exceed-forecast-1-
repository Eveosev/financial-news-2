Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ,
the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, reported
fourth-quarter profit and revenue that beat analysts’ estimates
after sales of the metal surpassed expectations.  Net income fell 59 percent to $640 million, or 67 cents a
share, from $1.55 billion, or $1.63 a share, a year earlier, the
Phoenix-based company said in a statement today. The average of
19 estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of 61 cents a
share. Revenue slid 26 percent to $4.16 billion from $5.6
billion. The average of 11 estimates was for $3.84 billion.  Freeport fell 0.2 percent to $44.37 at the close in New
York. The shares have declined 23 percent in the past 12 months.  Copper for March delivery rose 1.3 percent to settle at
$3.8005 a pound on the Comex in  New York . Prices earlier reached
$3.8215, the highest since Sept. 20.  “Copper markets are tight worldwide,” Freeport Chief
Executive Officer Richard C. Adkerson said on the company’s
fourth-quarter earnings conference call. Chinese demand remains
strong and Freeport is seeing a “fairly positive” outlook from
downstream customers in the U.S., he said.  Freeport’s fourth-quarter copper sales were 823 million
pounds, compared with the company’s December forecast of 800
million pounds. Output at the strike-hit Grasberg mine in
 Indonesia  was better than expected and the company was also
helped in the quarter by the timing of shipments, it said.  Grasberg Mine  About 8,000 workers at the mine, which has the world’s
largest recoverable reserves of copper, began a strike for
higher wages on Sept. 15 and signed a wage deal three months
later. Grasberg is expected to resume full operations during the
first quarter, Freeport said. It said yesterday that shipments
of copper concentrates, a form of ore that’s processed by
smelters, had restarted.  Freeport’s cost to produce copper, gold and molybdenum in
the fourth quarter on a copper-equivalent basis was $1.57 a
pound, up from 53 cents a year earlier. That exceeded the $1.49
estimate of  Jorge Beristain , a mining analyst at Deutsche Bank
AG in Greenwich,  Connecticut .  Costs may average $1.38 a pound in 2012 as higher labor,
energy and material expenses offset increased sales volumes,
Freeport said.  “There doesn’t appear to be a whole lot of easing on the
cost front,” Daniel Rohr, an analyst at Morningstar Investment
Services Inc. in  Chicago , said today in a telephone interview.
“On the volume side, it looks pretty good.”  Sales Forecasts  Freeport forecast 2012 sales of 3.8 billion pounds of
copper and 1.2 million ounces of gold, compared with a November
projection of 3.9 billion pounds and 1.2 million ounces.  The company also operates mines in the Americas and  Africa .
Expansions in  Peru , the  Democratic Republic  of Congo and  Arizona 
may add 1 billion pounds of annual copper production at a cost
of $6 billion, Adkerson said. Freeport is increasing U.S. copper
production after curbing output and halting expansions during
the global economic recession in 2008 and 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
