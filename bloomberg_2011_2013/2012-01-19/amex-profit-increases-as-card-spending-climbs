American Express Co. (AXP) , the largest
credit-card issuer by purchases, capped a record year for profit
and beat analysts’ estimates as fourth-quarter net income
climbed 12 percent and customer spending surged.  Net income  was $1.19 billion, or $1.01 a share, up from
$1.06 billion, or 88 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
lender said yesterday in a statement. The average estimate of 23
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings per share of 99
cents. Net revenue for the quarter rose 6.9 percent to $7.74
billion.  “Cardmembers spent a record amount on their American
Express cards, continuing a trend that has translated into
overall share gains during the last two years,” Chief Executive
Officer Kenneth I. Chenault, 60, said in the statement. “The
overall recovery in the U.S. remains uneven and the environment
in  Europe  continues to pose challenges for the global economy.”  Chenault is expanding AmEx’s reach beyond its affluent
credit-card clients with a new payment system for smartphones
and computers as it vies for customers who prefer debit cards.
The electronic wallet, called Serve, may draw more transactions
to AmEx’s global network. In June, the company introduced a
prepaid card that also targets a broader consumer base.  Full-Year Profit  Profit for the year increased 22 percent to $4.9 billion
and revenue advanced 8.6 percent to $30 billion, both records.  American Express climbed 0.8 percent to $50.95 at 4 p.m. in
New York and has advanced 13 percent in the past year. The
shares slid 2.3 percent at 5:32 p.m. in extended trading.  Fourth-quarter U.S. card income rose 3.9 percent to $727
million from a year earlier and international card income
climbed 54 percent to $152 million, according to the statement.  Worldwide card spending, or billed business, rose 11
percent to $219 billion, the company said in a financial
supplement. Individuals spent an average of $3,933, an increase
of 8.4 percent from a year earlier, when AmEx had fewer cards
outstanding.  “We continued to grow well above the average rate of our
large issuing competitors, despite difficult prior-year
comparisons and a challenging global economic environment,”
Chief Financial Officer Dan Henry said in a conference call with
analysts. “Certain regions internationally did show slowing
growth, especially in Europe, where growth slowed to 4
percent.”  The company set aside $409 million in the fourth quarter to
cover future loan losses, a 71 percent increase from a year
earlier, AmEx said. Total expenses were $5.59 billion, up from
$5.53 billion.  Write-offs for loans AmEx deems uncollectible fell to 2.3
percent in December, from 2.4 percent in the previous month, the
company said in a Jan. 17 regulatory filing. Loans at least 30
days overdue, a signal of future defaults, fell to 1.4 percent
from 1.5 percent, the lowest of the six-biggest U.S. credit-card
issuers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
