Princeton University economist  Alan Blinder  said he sees a “likelihood” the Federal Reserve will
undertake a third round of quantitative easing this year because
of Europe’s debt and financial woes.  “The odds of getting through 2012 without bad
repercussions from Europe” aren’t likely, Blinder, the Fed’s
former vice chairman, said in an interview today on Bloomberg
Radio’s “The Hays Advantage” with  Kathleen Hays . While there’s
a possibility the Fed may buy more bonds, it won’t happen
“right away.”  Fed officials, who meet in Washington next week, have “a
lot” on their plate right now and will have “big financial
problems” if “Europe blows up,” Blinder said. They’re likely
to make significant changes to their statement, including
removing the pledge to keep rates near zero through at least
mid-2013, he said.  In the U.S., “the tea leaves are looking better” as the
labor and housing markets improve, he said. Still, “I wouldn’t
be throwing any lavish parties yet.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
