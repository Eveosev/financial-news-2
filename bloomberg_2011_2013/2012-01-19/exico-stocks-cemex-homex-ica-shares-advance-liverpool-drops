The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:02 p.m. Mexico City time.  The IPC  index  rose 0.8 percent to 37,787.92.  Mexican stocks followed U.S. equities higher as American
jobless claims plunged to the lowest level in almost four years.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*)  , Mexico’s largest
homebuilder, rose 2.8 percent to 44.65 pesos.  Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) 
, the country’s biggest construction company, rose 2
percent to 18.38 pesos.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, rose 4.4 percent to 8.55 pesos. The  Mexican peso 
touched the strongest level since Oct. 31, helping reduce costs
for the company that has most of its debt in U.S. dollars.  El Puerto de Liverpool SAB  (LIVEPOLC MM), a Mexican
department store operator, declined 0.2 percent to 99.09 pesos
as the country’s same-store sales increased at a slower pace.
Same-store retail sales rose 3.8 percent in December compared
with a year earlier, following a 14.6 percent increase for
November, the country’s retail association, known as ANTAD, said
in a report distributed today in  Mexico  City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
