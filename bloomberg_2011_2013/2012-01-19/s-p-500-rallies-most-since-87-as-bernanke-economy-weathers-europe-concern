U.S. stocks  are off to the best
start in 15 years as investors speculate Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has done enough to insulate the economy
from Europe’s debt crisis.  The  S&P 500  has gained 4.5 percent, the most since it rose
4.8 percent over the first 12 days in 1997, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Stocks are overcoming earnings that
 trailed estimates  by the widest margin in three years as
improvements in  hiring , manufacturing and car sales extend the
biggest  fourth-quarter advance  since 2003.  Bernanke has left the target rate on overnight loans
between banks unchanged since the end of 2008, the  longest
stretch  since at least 1971, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The policy may push more investors toward equities after yields
on 10-year Treasuries finished 2011 within a quarter-point of a
record low and the economy grew at an estimated 3.1 percent rate
last quarter, said  John Carey  of Pioneer Investments.  “It’s probably a good idea not to fight someone so much
bigger than you are,” Carey, a Boston-based money manager at
Pioneer, said in a telephone interview on Jan. 18. The firm
oversees about $220 billion. “The Fed will probably stay on its
course,” he said. “I haven’t heard any indication that the Fed
is considering boosting  interest rates , so stocks will look
attractive from an income point of view.”  Worst to First  Three companies whose declines were among the 10 biggest in
the S&P 500 last year are among the  10 largest gainers in 2012 .
Netflix Inc., the Los Gatos, California-based movie service,
climbed 49 percent.  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp., which lost 58 percent in 2011, gained 25 percent
this year, while Sears Holdings Corp. in  Hoffman Estates ,
 Illinois , rose 36 percent after losing 56 percent.  The S&P 500 advanced seven of the first eight days this
year, something that has occurred eight times since 1900, data
compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. show. The mean return those
years was 16 percent, the data show.  About $640 billion has been added to the value of American
shares this year and the S&P 500 reached an almost six-month
high yesterday, as economic reports outweighed concern that
downgrades for European nations would worsen the debt crisis.
 France  was stripped of its top rating by S&P and banks suspended
talks with  Greece  over restructuring.  Economic Growth  “ Europe  is important but it’s not the end of the world if
they see a recession,” James Dunigan, who helps oversee $107
billion as chief investment officer in Philadelphia for PNC
Wealth Management, said in a Jan. 17 phone interview. “We’re
starting to see that modest economic growth expectation for this
year.”  The average forecast for U.S. gross domestic product growth
this year has been rising since October. From a low of 2
percent, the median estimate in a survey of 72 economists has
climbed to 2.3 percent, including a 0.2-point increase on Jan.
12 that represented the biggest one-day gain since projections
for 2012 began, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Optimism about the economy is helping investors shrug off
fourth-quarter earnings that have trailed estimates.  Profit (SPX)  fell
short of analyst forecasts by an average of 4.3 percent among
the eight S&P 500 companies that posted results in the first
week of earnings season, the data show. Three other quarters
with a worse first week of earnings season were in 2007 and 2008
as the economy was slipping into to the worst recession since
the 1930s.  Five-Month High  The S&P 500 increased 1.1 percent to 1,308.04 yesterday,
the highest level since July 26. It climbed 1.4 percent over
four days last week, reaching a five-month high of 1,292.48 on
Jan. 11 even after Microsoft Corp., the world’s biggest software
maker, said personal computer sales were probably worse than
forecast in the fourth quarter. The gauge advanced 0.5 percent
to 1,314.50 today.  “This year isn’t going to be about earnings,”  James Paulsen , who helps oversee about $333 billion as chief
investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital
Management, said in a Jan. 17 phone interview. “There’s a lot
of value in the market that could come just from people calming
down about this recession, depression calamity. It’ll be about
expanding that multiple.”  Combined S&P 500 profit is forecast to reach  $104.64 a
share  in 2012, the highest level ever, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark index is trading at 12.6
times forecast earnings. That compares with 13.4 at the
beginning of 2011. The S&P 500’s average ratio in 2011 was 14.1
based on  reported earnings . The five-decade mean is 16.4.  Unprecedented Stimulus  Central banks around the world have taken unprecedented
measures to prevent the European debt crisis from triggering a
global recession. European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
last month unveiled plans to offer banks 36-month, 1 percent
loans through two so-called longer-term refinancing operations,
known as LTROs.  That combined with investor speculation of a third round of
stimulus by the Fed and bets  China ’s central bank will ease
monetary policy has fueled stock prices, according to Doug Noland, the  money manager  for Pittsburgh-based Federated
Investors Inc.’s Prudent Bear Fund, which oversees $1.3 billion.
It won’t last, he said.  “Markets over the years have become programmed to focus a
lot on monetary stimulus,” Noland said in a Jan. 17 phone
interview. “It’s a very dangerous reason to be buying equities.
We saw in 2011 how QE2 didn’t have much fire power. We’ve seen
European policy making repeatedly disappoint the markets.”  Target Rate Unchanged  Fed policy makers have left their target rate unchanged
since the end of 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The S&P
500  more than doubled  from its low in March 2009 after Bernanke
signaled in August 2010 the central bank would embark on a
second round of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing,
to boost the economy.  The index declined as much as 19 percent from its 2011 high
in April through October last year as the program ended and
concerns European leaders would fail to tame the region’s debt
crisis escalated. It has since rebounded 19 percent.  Gross domestic product in the euro region will shrink by
0.2 percent this year, the median estimate in a survey of 21
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The diverging outlooks are
reducing lockstep price moves. The so-called 30-day  correlation
coefficient  between the euro and S&P 500 fell 27 percent to 0.66
after reaching a record 0.91 in November.  Correlation Weakens  Speculation about whether European leaders would succeed in
containing the credit crisis sent equity, currency and commodity
markets up and down in unison last year. The relationship
between U.S. stocks and the euro weakened after American
unemployment fell to 8.5 percent from 9 percent and business
activity as measured by the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index
 expanded  at the fastest pace in seven months.  “A lot of people dismissed the original data in the fall
as being backward looking,” Paul Zemsky, the New York-based
head of  asset allocation  for ING Investment Management, said in
a telephone interview. His firm oversees $550 billion. “But
when you started seeing jobless claims going down, it looked
more and more like the U.S. had shrugged off a lot of the
European contagion.”  Rallying stocks have done little to entice investors.
Mutual funds that invest in U.S. equities posted $753 million in
inflows for the week ending Jan. 11 after $7.1 billion in
outflows during the first week of the year, Investment Company
Institute data show. Customers pulled about $63 billion for the
final three months of 2011, the data show.  Election Years  The S&P 500 has gained an average 6.1 percent during
presidential election years, compared with 4.4 percent in the
years that follow, according to Bloomberg data going back to
1952. The index has posted a positive return for the last seven
months of those years 87 percent of the time, data from the
Stock Trader’s Almanac show.  “Committed bears have to pull in their claws a little,”
according to Brian Barish, who helps oversee about $7 billion as
Denver-based president of Cambiar Investors LLC. “On the more
bullish side, corporate earnings continue to be very good and
stocks in a lot of areas are quite undemanding in terms of their
valuations,” Barish said in a Jan. 17 phone interview. “We
could have a good year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
