European Union regulators restarted
their antitrust review of plans by  Google Inc. (GOOG) , the biggest
maker of smartphone software, to buy  Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc (MMI) .  The European Commission  set  a new deadline of Feb. 13 to
rule on the deal. It stopped the review on Dec. 6 to seek more
information from the companies.  Regulatory reviews mean the purchase by Google is likely to
close in 2012, Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola Mobility
said in November. Google plans to use Motorola Mobility’s more
than 17,000 patents to protect supporters of its Android
software in licensing and legal disputes with rivals such as
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  -- and also move into the hardware business.  Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, declined to
comment.  Jennifer Erickson , a spokeswoman for Motorola Mobility,
didn’t immediately respond to a call and an e-mail seeking
comment.  Google’s  shares  gained 0.97 percent on the news, or $6.66
to $638.60 before falling back to $635.74 at 2:05 p.m. in New
York trading.  Mountain View , California-based Google and Motorola
Mobility in September received a request for additional
information from the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust
division. China is also reviewing the deal, Shang Ming, the head
of the country’s Ministry of Commerce’s antimonopoly bureau,
said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
