The  Port Authority  of New York and
 New Jersey , owner and operator of bridges, tunnels, airports and
transit facilities in the New York City area, said it sold bonds
through a competitive bid at the lowest cost in 46 years  JPMorgan Chase & Co . yesterday won the bidding for $400
million of bonds due from 2030 to 2042 at a total interest cost
of 3.86 percent, the lowest of seven bids received, said Steve Coleman, an agency spokesman.  The debt, rated AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings,
the fourth-highest grade, will be used for capital projects,
refinancing higher-cost debt or both, according to an offering
statement.  Borrowing costs for U.S. state and local governments have
declined to the lowest since the 1960s as the  Federal Reserve 
has kept benchmark interest rates near zero, and last year’s
supply of municipal bonds declined 30 percent to $285 billion.
At the same time, concern about European government defaults has
boosted demand for less-risky securities, such as U.S.
Treasuries and municipal bonds.  The  interest rate  on  20-year general-obligation bonds  with
an average Moody’s Investors Service rating of Aa2, the third-
highest grade, fell 0.21 percentage point to 3.62 percent in the
week ended Jan. 12, according to the Bond Buyer 20-General
Obligation Bond index, the oldest gauge of yields in the $3.7
trillion muni market. That’s the lowest since April 13, 1967.  Payment on the Port Authority’s 171st series of
consolidated bonds will be generated by revenue from  John F.
Kennedy , LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International airports;
two Hudson River tunnels; four bridges; and six marine-cargo
terminals. The agency, which also owns the  World Trade Center
site , has about $17 billion of such outstanding debt.  The agency in September voted to raise bridge and tunnel
tolls by 56 percent over five years, a move that should
stabilize its finances as it proceeds with a $25.1 billion 10-
year capital plan, Fitch said in a Jan. 13 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
