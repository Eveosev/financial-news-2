Good afternoon, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items
forthe busy person's media diet. The Keystone XL pipeline is a no-go, at least
for now. That's what President Obama yesterday told Canadian Prime Minister
 Stephen Harper , who hoped to build the artery connecting Canadian oil sands
crude to U.S. refineries. How much does the decision matter? Probably not much.
While it sets up a political battle for U.S. 2012 elections, the $7 billion
pipeline will likely proceed  with an alternate route , and TransCanada is likely
get approval by early 2013, safely after the U.S. election. From a
sustainability perspective, nothing has changed. The world needs oil, and demand
is strong enough to drive oil sands extraction, the energy-intensive, carbon-
emitting process for mining crude from sand. Until fuel prices reflect the
social and environmental costs of carbon, politically timed decisions about
pipeline routes are mostly just political. And now the news: Obama’s Keystone Denial Prompts Canada to Look to China Sales  (Bloomberg)
