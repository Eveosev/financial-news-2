The ruble climbed to the strongest
level against the dollar in three weeks as declining U.S. crude
inventories spurred demand for  Russia ’s chief export earner.  The Russian currency strengthened 0.5 percent to 31.35 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, its highest closing level
since Dec. 26. The ruble was little changed at 40.42 per euro
and 35.4315 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket.  Crude jumped 0.7 percent to $101.31 a barrel in New York
futures after government reports showed an unexpected decline in
inventories and  unemployment benefits  fell to the lowest level
in almost four years. Russia is the world’s largest oil
producer.  Russia’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds due 2020 rose, pushing
the yield down 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to
4.433 percent. Eurobonds due April 2015 yielded 11 basis points
less at 3.064 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
