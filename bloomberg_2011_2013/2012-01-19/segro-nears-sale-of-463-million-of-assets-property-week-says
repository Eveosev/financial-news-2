Segro Plc (SGRO)  is close to selling about
300 million pounds ($463 million) of industrial and regional
office properties to investors,  Property Week  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Harbert Management Corp. and Canmoor Holdings Ltd. offered
to buy four office parks near the English cities of Manchester
and Birmingham for about 200 million pounds, the magazine said
on its website.  Ignis Asset Management may acquire about 90 million pounds
of properties, mostly in the Southampton and Portsmouth areas of
southern England, Property Week said.  Segro, based in  London , declined to comment through
external public relations adviser David Shriver.  To contact the reporter on this story:
