California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  strengthened for the first time this week after  Tesoro
Corp. (TSO)  said it is planning maintenance on units at the Wilmington
oil refinery in  Southern California .  Carbob in  Los Angeles (MOGLDB85)  rose 2.25 cents to a premium of 10
cents a gallon against gasoline futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt-delivery of the fuel increased 1.29 cents to $2.9158 a
gallon.  Tesoro’s 97,000-barrel-a-day  Wilmington (SHWCCRUD)  refinery is
planning work on units that may cause the plant to flare gases
from Jan. 21 through Jan. 24, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at the
company’s headquarters in  San Antonio , said in an telephone
interview.  “These activities are not anticipated to have any impact
on Tesoro’s ability to fulfill its regional product supply
commitments,” Barbee said.  Carbob in  San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  strengthened 1.25 cents to a
premium of 3 cents a gallon versus futures. Tesoro is also
performing maintenance on units at the  Martinez (TEMTCRUD)  refinery in
Northern California.  California-blend diesel in  San Francisco (DIEISCAD)  was unchanged at a
discount of 2 cents a gallon against Nymex heating oil futures.
The same fuel in  Los Angeles (DIEILCAD)  was also unchanged at a premium of
3 cents against futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon , fell
1.5 cents to a discount of 5.5 cents to futures. That’s the
lowest level for the fuel in  Portland  since Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
