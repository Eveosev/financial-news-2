Spain  sold 6.61 billion euros of
bonds maturing in 2016, 2019 and 2022, compared with a maximum
target for the sale of 4.5 billion euros.  Demand for the 2016 bond was 3.24 times the amount sold,
the Bank of Spain said, compared with 1.71 times at an auction
of the same security last week. Demand for the 2022 bond was
2.17 times the amount sold, compared with a ratio of 1.54 when
it was auctioned in November.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
