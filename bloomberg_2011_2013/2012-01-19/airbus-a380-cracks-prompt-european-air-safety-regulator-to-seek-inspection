Singapore  Airlines Ltd., the second-
largest operator of Airbus SAS A380s, started inspecting
superjumbos today because of concerns about cracks in wing
parts.  The checks won’t impact operations,  Nicholas Ionides ,
a spokesman, said by telephone from Singapore. The 
Singapore-based carrier has 15 superjumbos.  The  European Aviation Safety Agency  also plans to issue a
notice today ordering inspections after Singapore Air and  Qantas
Airways Ltd. (QAN)  found cracks in A380 wing-rib feet. The fissures,
while “embarrassing,” pose no dangers to passengers flying on
the world’s largest commercial aircraft, Airbus Chief Executive
Officer  Tom Enders  said late yesterday.  “The A380 is a bit like Concorde,” said  Nick Cunningham ,
an analyst at Agency Partners in  London , referring to the
supersonic plane that flew from the late 1960s until a decade
ago. “It’s distinctive, it’s an icon, and so anything that
happens to it is big news. The cracks seem to be reasonably
normal for the course of business.”  If similar cracks had been find in the wings of other
planes in airline fleets, it would not have drawn public
attention, he said.  Shares of Airbus parent  European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co.  declined 0.2 percent to 25.49 euros as of 10:32 a.m.
in Paris. Singapore Air rose 0.6 percent to S$10.79.  Probe Underway  “I can’t say I’m proud of it,” Enders said in an
interview with  CNN  that aired late yesterday, referring to the
cracks discovered. “We’re obviously investigating how it
happened. We think we have a good understanding but the
investigation is ongoing.”  A total of 67 A380s were in service as of the end of 2011,
according to figures on Airbus’s web site. The iconic Concorde
model had only 14 planes in service: seven with Air France SA
and seven with then-British Airways Plc.  EASA hasn’t decided how often planes will need to be
checked, Dominique Fouda, a spokesman, said by phone from
Cologne,  Germany , yesterday.  Airbus initially advised on Jan. 5 that faults, linked to a
manufacturing issue, could be fixed during scheduled four-year
maintenance and didn’t need immediate checks. Wing-rib feet help
support aircraft wings.  Some additional cracks have been found on a limited number
of non-critical brackets,  Justin Dubon , an Airbus spokesman,
said yesterday.  Qantas, Emirates  Qantas will fully comply with the directive, Thomas
Woodward, a spokesman, said by e-mail. The Sydney-based carrier
hasn’t yet begun checks on its 11 in-service planes, he said.  Emirates, the biggest operator of the A380, has been told
by Airbus that the cracks aren’t “a major issue of any sort,”
said Nigel Page, the Dubai-based carrier’s director of
commercial operations for the Americas region. In an interview
from  Seattle , he said he wasn’t aware if the airline had found
any cracks. The carrier is closely monitoring its A380 fleet, it
said.  The U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  said in an e-
mailed statement that its engineers are working with EASA on the
issue. No U.S. airlines operate the jet.  Airbus has developed a “repair solution” that can be
applied if necessary, Enders said. The planemaker is also
applying a fix on aircraft being built, he said. The issue won’t
affect other aircraft types, he said.  Engine Explosion  Engineers first discovered the wing-rib feet cracks in an
Qantas A380 that was being repaired following a mid-air engine
explosion in November 2010. It was thought the cracks were
related to the accident until more were discovered in other
A380s.  Korean Air Lines Co. hasn’t found any cracks in its five
A380s, it said by e-mail. China Southern Airlines Co. is
operating A380 flights as normal, said You Yingping, a
spokesman. He wasn’t able to immediately comment on checks.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s fleet of eight A380s is as yet
unaffected by the cracks, Patrick Meschenmoser, a Frankfurt-
based spokesman, said by phone.  Air France KLM Group, whose Air France unit operates four
A380s, has been informed about the possibility of cracks and
will take any necessary measures, Brigitte Barrand, a
spokeswoman, said by telephone without indicating whether the
airline had discovered any cracks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
