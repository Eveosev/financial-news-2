Pumpkin Patch Ltd. (PPL) , a New Zealand
children’s clothing retailer, is headed for the best two-day
gain since June 2009 in Wellington trading after placing its
U.K. unit in administration.  The decision follows a review of the loss-making unit that
owns 36 stores, Auckland-based Pumpkin Patch said yesterday, The
 stock  rose 6.7 percent as at 10:35 a.m. following a 7.1 advance
yesterday. The 14 percent, two-day gain is the best since June
30, 2009.  “It just doesn’t make sense for us or our shareholders to
continue to maintain the existing operation up there,” Chief
Executive Officer Neil Cowie said in a statement yesterday.
“The economic environment in the  United Kingdom  and in wider
 Europe  is extremely difficult and we believe it is going to get
worse before it gets better. Therefore we expect the U.K.
operation would continue to make losses for some time to come.”  While there will be cash costs and a charge against
shareholders funds in the six months ending Jan. 31, the
elimination of U.K. losses will improve earnings in the second
half ending July 31, and in the future, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
