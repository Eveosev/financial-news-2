Kaufman & Broad SA , the French
property developer, plans to make up for a decline in apartment
sales by offering them at 25 percent below market prices, Chief
Executive Officer Guy Nafilyan told Le Figaro.  To do that, the company plans to build lodgings in areas
further from city centers that are still well-served by public
transportation, and to restrain costs by building in places that
donâ€™t require special foundations, Mafilyan said. The company
also plans to speed its diversification into senior and student
residences, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
