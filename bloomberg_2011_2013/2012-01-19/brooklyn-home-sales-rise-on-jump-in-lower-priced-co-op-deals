Home sales in  Brooklyn ,  New York ’s
most populous borough, climbed 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter
as falling  mortgage rates  pushed buyers into the market for
lower-priced properties.  Purchases of condominiums, co-ops and one- to three-family
homes totaled 1,558, up from 1,468 a year earlier, New York
appraiser  Miller Samuel Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas
Elliman Real Estate  said today in a joint report. Sales of co-
ops, which tend to be older and less-expensive properties,
surged 28 percent. The median price of all homes that changed
hands in the period declined 4.3 percent to $454,383.  “The lower the price point in the borough, the more
immediate change you see in consumer behavior with low mortgage
rates,”  Jonathan Miller , president of Miller Samuel, said in an
interview. “People that were on the fence about buying, the
drop in mortgage rates brought them into the market.”  The average rate for a  30-year  fixed U.S. home loan dropped
below 4 percent in October for the first time in Freddie Mac
records dating to 1971. The rate was 4 percent or lower for all
but three weeks in the fourth quarter, according to the McLean,
Virginia-based mortgage financier. The decline in borrowing
costs helped spur home purchases nationwide. Sales of  existing
houses  rose to a 10-month high in November, the National
Association of Realtors said Dec. 21.  In Brooklyn, co-op apartments accounted for 23 percent of
all home sales in the three months ended Dec. 31, up from 19
percent a year earlier, Miller said. The median price of co-op
deals declined 16 percent to $265,000, according to the report.  “Co-op prices didn’t fall 16 percent, we just had smaller
properties move,” Miller said.  Condo sales in the borough were little changed, with 479
properties changing hands in the fourth quarter, according to
 Miller Samuel  and Prudential. The median price of those
transactions dropped 7.5 percent from a year earlier to
$476,580. Purchases of condos in new developments increased 13
percent to 257, while the median price fell 5.8 percent to
$499,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
