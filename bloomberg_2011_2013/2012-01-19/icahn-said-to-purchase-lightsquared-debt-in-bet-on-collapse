Billionaire  Carl Icahn  has purchased
debt from Philip Falcone’s LightSquared Inc.’s bondholders as
the satellite-broadband- service  provider struggles to start
service, two people familiar with the transaction said.  Icahn, along with investors Andrew Beal and David Tepper
purchased $300 million in LightSquared debt sold by Farallon
Capital Management LLC. last month, said the people, who
declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak.
The move may give Icahn control of LightSquared’s radio spectrum
for less than Falcone originally paid.  As the Reston, Virginia-based company seeks approval to
convert satellite airwaves to mobile-phone spectrum,
interference with global-positioning devices threatens to kill
the process. In a letter last week regulators said no further
tests were needed after an investigation found that LightSquared
disrupts GPS receivers. The company has disputed the findings.  With the approval process in jeopardy, network investment
partner  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  said on Jan. 5 that it was
postponing its venture with closely-held LightSquared. Sprint
had agreed to build the company’s so-called fourth-generation
long-term evolution network.  Terry Neal , a LightSquared spokesman, declined to comment.
Harbinger Group Inc. and Beal Financial Corp. representatives
Lew Phelps and Jim Chambless declined to discuss the matter.
Icahn and Tepper, president of Appaloosa Management LP, weren’t
immediately available. Harbinger is Falcone’s hedge fund and the
primary investor in LightSquared.  LightSquared has limited time and may need more money by
April,  Jonathan Chaplin , an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG,
said last month. Falcone originally paid $4 billion for the
radio spectrum.  Icahn’s investment was first reported today by The Wall
Street Journal.  LightSquared has “enough money to last us several
quarters,” Neal said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
