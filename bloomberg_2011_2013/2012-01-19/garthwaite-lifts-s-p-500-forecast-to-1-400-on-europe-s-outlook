Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s  Andrew
Garthwaite  lifted his 2012 forecast for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index to 1,400, citing the European Central Bank’s
refinancing plans for banks as a “potential game changer.”  Garthwaite, the London-based global equity strategist at
the firm, had previously estimated the benchmark gauge for U.S.
equities would climb to 1,340 at the end of 2012. His new
forecast, which would be a 6.5 percent rise from the index’s
close today, pushes the average projection of 12 strategists
surveyed by Bloomberg to 1,349.  The  S&P 500  fell as much as 19 percent in 2011 amid
concerns the sovereign debt crisis in Europe would trigger a
global recession. ECB President  Mario Draghi  last month unveiled
plans to offer banks 36-month, 1 percent loans through two so-
called longer-term refinancing operations, known as LTROs. The
loans have prevented a “serious” bank funding crisis, he said
today.  “A lot has changed since early December,” Garthwaite
wrote in a note dated today. “The significance of the ECB’s
three-year LTRO is not yet fully understood. This is increasing
base money supply, potentially by an exceptionally large
amount.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 4.5 percent this year, the best
start since 1997. The measure has climbed 20 percent from its
2011 low of 1,099.23. The gauge advanced 0.5 percent to 1,314.50
today.  Economic Data  Garthwaite also said equities will continue to rebound on
improvement in the U.S. economic data, the steps in  China  to
ease monetary policy, the low discount rate and the cheaper
valuations of equities relative to bonds. He didn’t recommend
stocks at “overweight,” citing risks to U.S. growth momentum,
as well as global macro factors such as China’s housing market
and Europe’s potential recession.  Initial jobless claims in the U.S. fell to the lowest rate
since April 2008 last week, the Department of Labor said today.
