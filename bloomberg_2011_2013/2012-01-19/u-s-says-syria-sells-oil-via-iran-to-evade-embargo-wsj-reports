Iran  is selling Syrian crude on the
Arab nation’s behalf to help the government of President Bashar
al-Assad skirt international sanctions,  the Wall Street Journal
reported , citing U.S. officials it didn’t identify.  Last month 91,000 metric tons of Syrian crude were shipped
to Iran for sale on international markets, the newspaper said,
citing transit documents. In response, the U.S. Treasury
Department is targeting the insurance and registration of
tankers that transport Syrian oil, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
