Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd.  said
Adan Mohamed will remain as chief executive officer after he
didn’t get the post as head of the country’s revenue agency.  Mohamed applied for the position of commissioner-general of
the  Kenya Revenue Authority  “following internal consultations
with the board and Barclays Plc,” the bank said in an e-mailed
statement from Nairobi today. The revenue agency’s post was
awarded to John Njiraini, according to the statement.  Kennedy Onyonyi, spokesman for the Kenya Revenue Authority,
wasn’t immediately available when contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
