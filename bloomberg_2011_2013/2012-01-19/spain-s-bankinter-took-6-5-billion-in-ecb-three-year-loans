Bankinter SA (BKT) , a Madrid-based
mortgage lender, took 5 billion euros ($6.45 billion) in three-
year loans from the  European Central Bank  and will put some of
the funds to work by lending them out.  The bank will lend the money in higher-yielding loans and
also use it to acquire short-duration government bonds and buy
back its own debt, Chief Executive Officer Maria Dolores Dancausa said in a news conference in Madrid today.  As many as 523 euro-area lenders took money from the ECB’s
injection of 489 billion euros into the banking system last
month. Spanish banks’ average borrowings from the ECB rose in
December to 118.9 billion euros, the highest level in 18 months,
after lenders tapped the loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
