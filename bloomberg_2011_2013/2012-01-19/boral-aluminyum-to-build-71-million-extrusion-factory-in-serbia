Boral Aluminyum , a Turkish maker of
aluminum-extrusion products, signed a preliminary agreement to
develop a manufacturing plant in southern  Serbia  with state
support.  The 25,000 square-meter (270,000 square-feet) factory in
Doljevac may cost an estimated 55 million euros ($71 million) to
build and the investor will receive a 10 million-euro subsidy
for creating some 300 expected jobs, said Aleksandra Vuckovic,
spokeswoman for the  Serbia Investment and Export Promotion
Agency , in a phone interview.  SIEPA, which administers the government incentives, signed
the agreement today with Boral founder and owner, Bunyamin Atik,
and with authorities in the town located 240 kilometers (149
miles) southeast of the capital Belgrade. The plant may open in
August, producing aluminum profiles for doors, windows, trucks
and trailers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
