Madeleine Schickedanz is demanding
more than 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in compensation from
Sal. Oppenheim and property financier Josef Esch after she lost
money on investments in  Arcandor AG (ARO) , Manager Magazin reported.  Sal. Oppenheim and Esch deny the allegations, the magazine
said today in a preview of an article that will run tomorrow.  Arcandor, the former parent of Germanyâ€™s Karstadt
department-store chain, filed for insolvency in June 2009. Sal.
Oppenheim is now a unit of  Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK)   To contact the reporter on this story:
