Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities rose as fewer Americans than forecast filed
claims for jobless benefits and after  Spain  and  France  sold
bonds at lower yields, boosting the outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a
Japanese carmaker that gets about 70 percent of its sales
overseas, rose 1.6 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo. Those of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that depends on
Europe for almost a third of its sales, gained 1.3 percent.
Westpac Banking Corp. rose 0.9 percent and led financial stocks
higher in Sydney after Bank of America Corp., the second-largest
U.S. lender, swung to a fourth-quarter profit.  Futures on  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 8,715 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,650 in
 Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at  8,710 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained
0.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2 percent
in Wellington.  “The European government bond auctions are going well and
investors are starting to reverse their risk-avoidance stances
globally,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based
Nomura Holdings Inc. “Money is centering into the U.S., where
the fundamentals are good, and then is spreading out to the
world.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index advanced 0.5 percent in  New York 
yesterday as optimism about company earnings was boosted when
Bank of America reported it swung to a profit. A government
report showed initial jobless-benefit claims plunged by 50,000
to 352,000 in the week ended Jan. 14, the lowest level since
April 2008 and less than economists estimated.  European Stocks  European stocks gained for a fourth day, extending a five-
month high for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index, as Spain and France
sold bonds at lower yields.  France auctioned 7.97 billion euros of two-, three- and
four-year notes in its first sale of medium- and long-term debt
after losing its AAA rating at  Standard & Poor’s  last week.
Yields fell on all maturities.  Spain sold 6.6 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2016,
2019 and 2022, compared with a maximum target for the sale of
4.5 billion euros. The yields on the 2022 and 2019 securities
declined, while the 2016 borrowing costs increased.  The euro strengthened to a two-week high against the yen as
Spain raised more than its maximum target at the debt sale,
boosting optimism the region’s sovereign-debt crisis is being
contained. The 17-nation currency touched 100.06 yen today in
 Tokyo , the strongest since Jan. 4.  Dollar Rises  The dollar also appreciated to 77.32 yen today, compared
with 76.76 yen at the close of  stock trading  yesterday, boosting
the value of some overseas income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  gained 4.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.5 percent by the  S&P
500  and 4.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 12.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 12.6 times for the S&P 500 and 10.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Copper futures for March delivery gained 1.3 percent
yesterday in New York. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices
for six metals including copper and aluminum increased 1.6
percent to the highest level since Sept. 21. Australian
commodity stocks rose today, with  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest miner, gaining 0.9 percent.  Chinese Stocks  Most  Chinese stocks  in the U.S. rose, led by Internet
companies, on speculation  China  will loosen lending restrictions
and as plunging U.S. jobless claims bolstered the outlook for
the world’s largest exporter.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index  of
the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. was little changed at
101.20 yesterday in New York.  Chinese policy makers are under pressure to ease credit
after growth in the world’s second-biggest economy moderated to
the slowest pace in 10 quarters in the last three months of
2011. The banking regulator is relaxing loan limits and delaying
the implementation of the most stringent capital adequacy ratios
for lenders, said people with knowledge of the matter, declining
to be named because the plan hasn’t been announced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
