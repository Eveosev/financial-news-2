Malaysia’s growth will miss the
government’s forecast this year amid the faltering global
economy, according to the Malaysian Institute of  Economic
Research .  Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy will probably expand
3.7 percent in 2012, the partly-government funded institute said
in a statement in Kuala Lumpur today, cutting its earlier
estimate of 5 percent gross domestic product expansion. This is
below the 5 percent to 6 percent government forecast in its Oct.
7 budget statement.  “Economic growth will likely get bumpier in the months
ahead,” the institute said in the report. “Growth in the last
quarter of 2011 is expected to be much lower on account of
external developments. Latest monthly economic indicators are
already suggesting that.”  The  World Bank  said yesterday developing growth in Asia-
Pacific economies will slow for a second straight year on
Europe’s debt crisis and weaker global trade. Malaysia likely
expanded 4.9 percent in 2011, the institute said, missing the
government’s growth forecast of as much as 5.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
