Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , Canada’s largest oil-
pipeline operator, expects to have the Northern Gateway line
operating by 2017, said Chief Executive Officer Pat Daniel.  Enbridge proposed the crude pipeline from Alberta’s oil
sands to the coast of British Columbia, where it may be taken by
tanker to  Asia . Canada’s national energy regulator is now
holding hearings that will run through next year to solicit
comments on the project. Daniel spoke at a CIBC conference
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
