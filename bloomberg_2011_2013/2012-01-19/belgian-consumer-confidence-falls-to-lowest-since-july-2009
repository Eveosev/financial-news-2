Belgian  consumer confidence  dropped
to the lowest level in two and a half years in January as the
government struggled against faltering growth to meet a European
Union budget-deficit target.  The consumer sentiment index for  Belgium , the euro area’s
sixth-largest economy, dipped to minus 16 from minus 12 in
December, the Brussels-based  National Bank of Belgium  said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said last week that Belgium,
saddled with  Europe ’s fifth-highest debt, is at a “turning
point.” The premier won a reprieve from speeded-up EU deficit
sanctions on Jan. 11 after freezing 1.3 billion euros ($1.7
billion) of spending before a budget review next month. He has
pledged to cut the deficit to less than 3 percent of gross
domestic product this year, as required by the EU.  The six-party coalition led by Di Rupo in November unveiled
a 2012 budget based on a growth forecast of 0.8 percent that
contained 11.3 billion euros of spending cuts and tax increases
to pare the deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP. Since then, Budget
Minister Olivier Chastel has said  growth will slow  to between
zero and 0.5 percent, forcing Di Rupo to cut even deeper.  “Consumers have again taken a more pessimistic view of the
macroeconomic forecast,” the central bank said. “They expect
the general economic situation in particular to get worse over
the coming year. At the same time, fears of an increase in
unemployment have been revived.”  Households have become “more pessimistic” about their
savings capacity in the past month, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
