Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  rose 0.7
percent to 2,244.38 at 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw, gaining for a
fourth day.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper and
silver producer, slumped the most in a month after shareholders
rejected a proposal to buy back as much as 3 billion zloty ($893
million) of shares. The stock plunged as much as 8 percent to
119.8 zloty in Warsaw trading, the steepest intraday decline
since Dec. 15, and closed 0.2 percent lower at 129.9 zloty.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the country’s second-largest
refiner, gained 3.1 percent to 24.14 zloty as oil rose on signs
that the U.S. economic recovery is reducing the nation’s crude
inventories, and on concern that tensions with Iran may lead to
disruptions in exports from the  Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
