South Korean shipyards plan to buy
12 percent less steel plate this year, worsening a demand slump
that has hurt prices at Posco, the world’s biggest producer.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (009540) ,  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co.  and Samsung Heavy Industries Co. will cut
purchases to a combined 6.5 million metric tons from 7.4 million
tons, according to company figures. The yards are the world’s
biggest buyer of steel plate, which is used for making hulls and
in construction.  The shipbuilders, the world’s three biggest, are making
fewer oil tankers and container vessels as they focus on more
lucrative drill ships and offshore units that generally need
less steel. The shift may hurt earnings at Posco,  Dongkuk Steel
Mill Co. (001230)  and Hyundai Steel Co., which have boosted plate-making
capacity 72 percent since 2008.  “Steelmakers are in for a tough year,” said Bang Minjin,
an analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co. in  Seoul . “Their
one bright spot is about to fade.”  Hyundai Heavy, based in Ulsan, South Korea, expects to cut
the use of steel plate, its biggest raw-material cost, by 14
percent to 3.6 million tons this year. The tally includes two
affiliates.  The company’s orders for  oil tankers , container ships and
dry-bulk vessels halved to 23 last year because of competition
from  China  and a global drop in orders caused by a capacity
glut. The worldwide order backlog fell 26 percent in 2011, the
biggest decline since  Clarkson Plc  began compiling data in 1995.  Drill-Ship Orders  At the same time, Hyundai Heavy won a record 11 orders for
 drill ships  last year as oil companies increase exploration.
Such vessels, used for boring test wells, require about 20,000
tons of steel plate, half the amount needed for a 300,000-
deadweight ton oil tanker, according to the shipbuilder. New
tankers have double hulls to help prevent leaks.  A shipyard can sell a drill ship for about $600 million,
about six times the price it will get for a 300,000-deadweight
oil tanker, according to Lee Jae Won, an analyst at Tongyang
Securities Inc. in Seoul.  The three Korean steelmakers have boosted annual plate-
production capacity to 13.89 million tons from 8.09 million tons
in 2008, according to data from the  Korea Iron & Steel
Association . They added facilities after five years of record
orders caused steel-plate prices to almost quadruple to as much
as 1.41 million won ($1,240) per ton in 2008.  Price Drop  Posco (005490) ’s average selling price may drop to 920,000 won this
quarter, Chris Kim, a Samsung Securities Co. steel analyst,
wrote in a Jan. 11 report. The Pohang, South Korea-based
steelmaker’s average price was probably 980,000 won in the
fourth quarter of last year and 1.053 million won in the
preceding three months, Kim said.  Posco, the world’s third-biggest steelmaker, doesn’t have
any plans to adjust production and prices, said Kim Dong Ho, a
spokesman. The company, which gets 20 percent of sales from
steel plate, opened a 1.7 trillion won plant for making the
material last year, boosting capacity to 7 million tons a year.  The steelmaker reported a 13 percent decline in net income
for last year, missing analyst estimates. Profit may be little
changed this year at 3.3 trillion won, according to the median
of eight  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Hyundai Steel (004020) , an affiliate of Hyundai Motor Group, has no
plans to cut plate output, said Lee Choong Hee, a spokesman. The
Incheon-based company opened two blast furnaces in 2010 costing
a total of 6.23 trillion won and able to produce 1.5 million
tons of plate a year. Kim Sun Hong, a spokesman for Dongkuk
Steel, declined to comment.  Plate Oversupply  “The oversupply of steel plate is likely to last a bit
longer,” said Lee Young Seog, who helps manage about $7.8
billion in equities including Posco shares at Korea Investment
Management Co. in Seoul. “Shipbuilding orders fell considerably
last year and we don’t expect it to improve this year.”  Posco gained 1.8 percent to close at 414,500 won in Seoul
trading. Dongkuk advanced 2.4 percent to 23,300 won and Hyundai
Steel climbed 2.4 percent to 109,000 won.  Posco has fallen 13 percent in Seoul trading in the past 12
months, compared with a 15 percent decline for Hyundai Steel and
a 30 percent slump for Seoul-based Dongkuk. The benchmark Kospi
Index has dropped 7.4 percent in the period.  Lower Prices  The steelmakers have cut prices as they seek to boost sales
in markets including China, the biggest consumer and producer of
the metal.  South Korea ’s exports of plate increased 42 percent
last year to 2.9 million tons, according to the Korean
steelmakers group.  “Steelmakers will have to sell more overseas, even though
prices will be lower,” said HI Investment’s Bang. “This is
going to be bad news for profits.”  The  average price of steel plate  in China fell to 4,173
yuan ($661) per ton on Jan. 9, the lowest price since July 2010,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Posco is also challenging European and Japanese steelmakers
to supply plate for offshore structures. The company hasn’t
traditionally operated in this market because of booming demand
from shipbuilding. In October, it won a five-year deal to supply
plate for offshore units to  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   Materials Cost  Steelmakers may also benefit from a decline in raw material
prices, partly caused by reduced production in China. Posco’s
contract prices for  iron ore  may fall to an average $141 per ton
this year from an estimated $161 in 2011, according to a Jan. 13
report by Jeon Seung Hun, an analyst at Daewoo Securities Co.
Coking coal prices may drop to $230 a ton from $289, he said.  Daewoo Shipbuilding expects to cut plate use 10 percent
from last year’s tally of 1.7 million tons. The company, which
built the world’s biggest floating oil production and storage
vessel for  Total SA (FP) , plans to double output of offshore units
this year.  Samsung Heavy intends to buy 1.4 million tons of plate this
year, a 6.7 percent decline. The company is building the world’s
first floating LNG production and storage plant for Shell.
Hyundai Heavy is constructing two floating oil production and
storage vessels as well as a gas-processing facility for Chevron
Corp.’s Gorgon project in  Australia .  “Working on more offshore projects will be good for
shipyards’ earnings because they have higher margins,”
Tongyang’s Lee said. “It’s definitely not going to be good for
steelmakers.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
