Investors should buy the euro
against the  Swiss franc  in a bet the  Swiss National Bank  will
maintain its ceiling of 1.20 against the 17-nation currency,
according to Lloyds Capital Markets.  The SNB on Sept. 6 imposed the ceiling versus the euro and
resumed purchases of foreign currencies to protect exports and
ward off the risk of recession. The rate has been trending down
since early December, when it touched 1.2444 francs, and Lloyds
said signs of economic weakness and a lack of inflation will
help the SNB maintain the ceiling.  “That the SNB have unlimited supply of francs makes their
commitment credible as long as they don’t feel it is having
negative economic effects,” Adrian Schmidt and Jennifer Hau,
currency strategists at Lloyds in  London , wrote in a note to
investors. “Swiss inflation is negative, so there should be
little concern of inflationary impact.”  The Lloyds analysts recommended buying three-month forward
contacts on the euro against the franc at 1.2068, with a target
of gaining to 1.2325. They suggested a stop-loss order at 1.990
to protect investors if the market moves against the trade.  The euro was little changed Thursday, trading at 1.2083
francs.  The Zurich-based central bank has spent relatively little
defending the ceiling rate in comparison to a failed 2009
effort. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows that the percentage of
the SNB’s total holdings in terms of euros had declined through
the first three quarters of 2011.  In 2009, the SNB established a ceiling at 1.50. The
inability to maintain the rate was attributed to the Greek
crisis and that fair value was close 1.40, according to the
analysts.  The 1.20 line is “more appropriate” than the failed
ceiling in 2009 so “there is more chance of success this time
around,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
