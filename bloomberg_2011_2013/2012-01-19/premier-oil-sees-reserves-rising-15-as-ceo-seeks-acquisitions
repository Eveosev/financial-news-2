Premier Oil Plc (PMO) , a London-based oil
explorer, expects to raise estimated reserves about 15 percent
after acquisitions, while the company is examining further deals
to expand worldwide, Chief Executive Officer Simon Lockett said.  The board may increase the company’s proven and probable
reserves estimate to about 300 million barrels of oil equivalent
in March after acquisitions and field developments last year, he
said. Reserves totalled 261 million barrels in 2010.  “We’ve still got a strong balance sheet and we’d like to
carry on if we can” with acquisitions, Lockett said in a phone
interview. “We will continue to look for companies or assets
where the holding company has got balance sheet issues, and we
can do something with the development of the assets.”  Premier in 2011 bought assets from BP Plc, took over EnCore
Oil Plc and acquired field licenses from  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  It will
invest about $1.1 billion in projects this year, Lockett said.  Production will rise to about 75,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day at the end of the year, from 60,000 barrels at
the end of last year, the company forecast today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
