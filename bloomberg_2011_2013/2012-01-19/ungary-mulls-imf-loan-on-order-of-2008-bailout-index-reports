Hungary  may obtain an  International
Monetary Fund  and European Union loan of a “similar order to
the 2008” bailout the country received,  Index  reported, citing
a document signed by Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy .  Hungary may get between 17 billion euros ($22 billion) and
20 billion euros from the organizations, the news website said,
citing a government document it obtained about the status of
bailout talks. Hungary received a 20 billion-euro loan in 2008.  Hungary needs to make progress in “key areas” for the
bailout talks to succeed, including on central bank
independence, banks, extraordinary industry levies, the budget
and taxes, Index said, citing the document.  The government expects Hungary’s loan request to be on the
agenda of a European Union finance ministers’ meeting on Jan.
24, Index said. A decision on Hungary’s loan may be made at the
finance chiefs’ Feb. 21 meeting, the news website said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
