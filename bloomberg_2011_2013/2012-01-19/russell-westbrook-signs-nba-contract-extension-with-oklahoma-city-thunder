Guard  Russell Westbrook  signed a
multiyear contract extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder,
likely keeping him teamed with fellow All-Star  Kevin Durant  for
the next several years.  Financial terms and the exact length of the deal weren’t
disclosed in a news release announcing the extension. It’s worth
$80 million over five years -- the maximum allowed -- and will
go into effect next season, Yahoo! Sports said, citing
unidentified people in the  National Basketball Association .  Durant, who like Westbrook is 23, signed a five-year
contract extension in July 2010 that will keep him under
contract through the 2015-16 season, according to ESPN.  Oklahoma City has the best record in the Western Conference
at 12-3. The club reached the conference finals last season
before falling in five games to the  Dallas Mavericks , the
eventual NBA champions.  Westbrook, who was named second team All-NBA last season,
has career averages of 17.9 points, seven assists and 4.8
rebounds per game. By the end of the 2010-11 campaign he became
one of five NBA players to record 4,000 points, 1,500 assists
and 1,000 rebounds through his first three seasons, joining
LeBron James, Chris Paul, Anfernee Hardaway and Oscar Robertson.  Westbrook is averaging 20.5 points, 5.5 assists and five
rebounds per game this season, and this week he was named one of
20 finalists to play for the U.S. during the 2012 Olympics in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
