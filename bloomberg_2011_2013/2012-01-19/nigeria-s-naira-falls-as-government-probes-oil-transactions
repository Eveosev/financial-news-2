Nigeria ’s naira strengthened for a
second day against the dollar, reversing earlier declines.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer appreciated
0.1 percent at 161.425 per dollar after falling 0.2 percent in
interbank trading as of 3:45 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ghana’s cedi weakened for a third day against the dollar as
oil-driven economic growth increased demand for the U.S.
currency.  The cedi depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.7520 per dollar, the
lowest in almost 18 years, as of 3:45 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
