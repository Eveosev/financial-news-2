The yuan weakened for the first time
in three days on speculation  China  will curb currency
appreciation to support exports as economic growth slows.  China’s economy  will expand 8 percent in the first three
months of this year, the least since 2009, according to the
median estimate by Bloomberg survey of economists. It grew 8.9
percent last quarter, according to official data this week. The
People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s fixing 0.05 percent
stronger at 6.3173 per dollar, while the  Dollar Index (DXY)  slid for a
third day.  “We can’t see any significant signals in today’s fixing as
it reflects mostly the decline in dollar,” said Eddie Cheung,
an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong. “Investors
are cautious again as they have to wait for the next set of data
to see whether China is heading into a sharper slowdown.”  The yuan fell 0.07 percent to close at 6.3167 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
It is allowed to trade as much as 0.5 percent on either side of
the daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency slipped 0.25
percent to 6.2983. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards
declined 0.21 percent to 6.2855, a 0.6 percent premium to the
onshore spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
