Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany â€™s second-
biggest lender, said retained earnings in the fourth quarter and
first half will help it meet European Banking Authority capital
requirements without government aid.  The lender had retained earnings of about 1.2 billion euros
($1.6 billion) in the fourth quarter, which includes one-off
income from the buyback of hybrid equity instruments and
excludes potential further Greek writedowns, it said in a
statement today. Commerzbank expects another 1.2 billion euros
in retained earnings in the first half of this year, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
