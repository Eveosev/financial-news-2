“Occupy the Courts,” a group
planning to rally outside a  New York  federal courthouse
tomorrow, sued after the U.S. denied it a permit.  The rally, intended to coincide with similar protests
outside 120 U.S. courthouses in 46 states, was planned for the
Daniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse in lower Manhattan.
Organizers said they want to call attention to a 2010 Supreme
Court decision that made it easier for corporations to spend
money in election campaigns.  “The purpose of the day of action is to mark the second
anniversary of the  U.S. Supreme Court (1000L) ’s infamous Citizens United
v. Federal Election Commission decision that opened the
floodgates to unlimited corporate money in elections,” Occupy
the Courts said in its complaint, filed last night.  The suit was brought by Occupy the Courts and Jarret
Wolfman, an organizer with the group, against two U.S. General
Services Administration officials, Wesley French and Joanna
Rosato. The GSA denied the permit for a rally from 4 p.m. to 6
p.m. tomorrow, citing a conflict with the swearing in of new
citizens and the installment of a new judge, Occupy the Courts
said in the complaint.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for today.  A voice mail left with the GSA press office seeking comment
on the suit wasn’t immediately returned.  The case is Wolfman v. French, No. 12-CV-443, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
