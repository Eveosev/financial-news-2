Blue Panorama Airlines SpA, an
Italian carrier, will start a weekly non-stop flight between
Rome and Seychelles from Feb. 14, according to the Seychelles
Tourism Board.  The airline plans to then boost the service to two flights
a week from July, the Victoria-based agency said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Air Seychelles, the Indian Ocean archipelagoâ€™s national
carrier, stopped operating routes to  Europe  last month to cut
costs. Italy is its second biggest source of tourists after
 France , according to the statistics agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
