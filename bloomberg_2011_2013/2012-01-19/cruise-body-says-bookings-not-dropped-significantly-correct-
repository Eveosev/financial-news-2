(Corrects travel industry official’s comment in headline
and text.)  Bookings haven’t declined
significantly since the Costa Concordia capsized off the coast
of  Italy  last week, a cruise industry executive said.  There has been no “significant reduction in activity”
since the Jan. 13 grounding that killed at least 11 people and
left 20 passengers and crew missing, said Christine Duffy,
president and chief executive officer of the Cruise Lines
International Association, at a briefing in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
