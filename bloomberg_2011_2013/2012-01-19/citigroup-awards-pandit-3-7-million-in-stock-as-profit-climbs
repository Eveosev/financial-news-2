Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, awarded Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  about $3.7 million in stock as the firm reported a 6.4
percent increase in full-year profit.  The bonus was among shares the New York-based lender
awarded this week to 12 executives, whose grants were described
in regulatory filings yesterday. The awards had a total value of
almost $25 million, based on the closing price of the shares on
Jan. 17, when Citigroup posted 2011 net income of $11.3 billion,
Pandit’s second profitable year as CEO.  The award is the latest payout for Pandit, 55, since the
bank returned to profitability. Last year, when Citigroup shares
slid 44 percent, he received a base salary of $1.75 million and
a retention plan that could be valued at more than $40 million.
In July, he received the remaining $80 million of the $165
million that Citigroup owed him from the bank’s 2007 buyout of
his Old Lane Partners LP hedge fund.  “We made solid progress in 2011,” Pandit said in a
statement announcing fourth-quarter results. “We are
increasingly focused on driving earnings through our core
franchise and beginning to return capital to our shareholders
this year.”  Chief Operating Officer  John Havens  received an award
valued at $3.47 million while consumer-banking boss Manuel Medina-Mora’s award was $2.64 million, the filings show. Chief
Risk Officer Brian Leach’s award was $2.36 million.  Corbat, Callahan  Michael Corbat , who was appointed head of the bank’s
operations for  Europe ,  Middle East  and Africa in November,
received shares valued at $2.08 million, as did Don Callahan,
the bank’s chief administrative officer.  Pandit is cutting 5,000 jobs and seeks to cut as much as
$3 billion from the bank’s expenses this year as he seeks to
control costs. Sales at the company’s investment-banking and
trading operations, overseen by Havens, declined for the year
amid investor concern that the most indebted European nations
could default.  Citigroup shares  fell  28 cents, or less than a percent, to
$29.05 at 11:38 a.m. in New York trading. The shares advanced 11
percent this year through yesterday.  Jon Diat, a company spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
