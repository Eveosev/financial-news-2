Flughafen Wien AG (FLU) , the operator of
Vienna International Airport, cut its dividend and forecast
fewer flights because of the weakening global economy.  Flughafen Wien will reduce the payout by as much as 50
percent after giving shareholders 2 euros a share last year, the
Vienna-based company said today in a statement. The airport
operator had been expected to pay 1.50 euros a share, according
to the data of three analysts collected by Bloomberg.  The number of flights serving Vienna, a hub for eastern
European travel, will fall by as much as 1 percent this year
while maximum takeoff weight will drop by as much as 3 percent,
according to the company. Passenger numbers, which rose 7.2
percent to 21.1 million travelers in 2011, may grow as much as 1
percent this year, Flughafen Wien said.  The slowing economy will hinder Flughafen Wien as it starts
putting a new terminal costing more than 800 million euros
($1.03 billion) into service. The euro regionâ€™s economy may
contract 0.3 percent, compared with a previous estimate of a 1.8
percent gain, according to the  World Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
