U.S. stock-index futures maintained
gains after government data showed jobless claims decreased last
week to the lowest level in almost four years.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March rose 0.4 percent to 1,306.9 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York .   Jobless claims plunged by 50,000 to 352,000 in the week
ended Jan. 14, the lowest level since April 2008, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of 41 economists in a Bloomberg News survey projected
384,000. A Labor Department spokesman said the decrease
reflected the usual volatility seen during this time of year.  Futures climbed earlier as results from Bank of America
Corp. to Morgan Stanley and EBay Inc. reassured investors that
the recovery in the world’s largest economy remains intact.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 4 percent in 2012, its best start
to a year since 1987, as U.S. economic reports and speculation
that  China  will loosen monetary policy outweighed concern that
downgrades of European nations will worsen the debt crisis.  U.S. companies are struggling to top analysts’ estimates for
profits, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Earnings-per-share for
the 24 companies that reported results since Jan. 9 has shrunk
9.7 percent, with more than 40 percent of these firms missing
forecasts, the data show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
