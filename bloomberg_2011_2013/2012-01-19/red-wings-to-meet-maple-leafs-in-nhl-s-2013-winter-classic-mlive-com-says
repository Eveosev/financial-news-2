The  Detroit Red Wings  will face-off
against the  Toronto Maple Leafs  in the National Hockey League’s
2013 Winter Classic at the University of Michigan’s stadium,
MLive.com reported, citing a person familiar with the plan.  The last matchup on Jan. 2 saw the New York Rangers defeat
the Philadelphia Flyers 3-2 on an outdoor ice rink at Citizens
Bank Park, home to Major League Baseball’s Philadelphia Phillies.  A record crowd for a hockey game of 104,173 watched the
home team beat Michigan State 5-0 on Dec. 11, 2010, at Michigan
Stadium, MLive.com said.  The official NHL announcement on the Winter Classic is
expected in February, MLive.com said.  NHL spokeswoman Bernadette Mansur didn’t immediately answer
an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
