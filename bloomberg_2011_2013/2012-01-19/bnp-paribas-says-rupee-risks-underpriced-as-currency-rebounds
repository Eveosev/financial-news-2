Thio Chin Loo, a Singapore-based
senior currency analyst at BNP Paribas SA, comments on the
outlook for  India ’s rupee.  “The market may have underpriced risks of the current
account widening further, a poor fiscal deficit and bad loans at
Indian banks. Market sentiment can shift very quickly and at
these levels, when the rupee is approaching 50, I wouldn’t
advise corporates to chase a stronger currency. If exporters
haven’t already hedged their dollar exposure, they should wait
for a rebound in the greenback to 52 before hedging their
dollars in the forward market.”  The currency climbed 5.7 percent this year to 50.215 per
dollar in Mumbai as of 9:39 a.m., after dropping 16 percent in
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Three-month
onshore rupee forward contracts traded at 51.29 per dollar,
compared with 52.58 at the end of last week.  “Whether the rupee’s rally continues and how far it could
run will depend on euro-zone developments, data and policy
guidance. The market also could have underpriced some risks
regarding India’s domestic fundamentals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
