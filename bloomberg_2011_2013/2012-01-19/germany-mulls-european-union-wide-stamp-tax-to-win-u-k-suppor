German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  may
revise her call for a financial transaction tax by backing a
U.K.-style, European Union-wide  stamp duty  on share purchases to
lure Prime Minister  David Cameron  back into the European fold.  Germany sees adoption of a stamp duty as a means to win
U.K. support for a levy that covers the whole EU, German Economy
Minister Philipp Roesler said today in an advance copy of an
interview with the  Rheinische Post  newspaper. Germany has a
“special interest” in having Britain involved, he said.  “In the context of the current negotiations, special
attention will certainly be paid to talks with the British
side,” German Deputy Finance Minister Hartmut Koschyk said in
an interview in Berlin.  Germany  wants an agreement to include
all 27 EU member states, he said.  An EU-wide tax on share transactions, like that in force in
the U.K., would help Merkel appease voters frustrated with the
role of banks in the financial crisis and end a conflict with
her Free Democratic Party coalition partner, which has resisted
a levy in the EU that doesn’t include the U.K.  To contact the reporters on this story:
