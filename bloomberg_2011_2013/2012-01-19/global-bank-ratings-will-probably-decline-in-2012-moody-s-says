Bank ratings worldwide will probably
decline in 2012, said Moody’s Investors Service, citing the
European sovereign debt crisis, economic uncertainty and reduced
access to  capital markets .  While support from central banks and regulation designed to
make banks safer will help, fiscally weaker governments, less
predictable economic growth and scarcer access to interbank
lending will push ratings down, Moody’s said in a statement
today.  France and  Austria  lost their top credit ratings in a
number of downgrades on Jan. 14 that left  Germany  with the euro
area’s only stable AAA grade as  Standard & Poor’s  warned that
crisis-fighting efforts are still falling short. The euro region
economy may contract by 0.3 percent, according to World Bank
forecasts.  “Banks operating in more stable environments, and banks
with strong, retail-oriented businesses and funding profiles
will be less affected,” said Johannes Wassenberg, a Moody’s
analyst, in a telephone interview. Rating changes will occur in
the first half of the year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
