Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL)  dropped the most
in almost a week in  Tel Aviv  after the country’s biggest mobile-
phone provider gave a fourth-quarter profit outlook that came
below analysts estimates.  The  shares  lost 2.6 percent, their biggest drop since Jan.
15, to 59.70 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. They
fell more than any other member in the TA-25 Index benchmark
index.  Cellcom said adjusted profit for the quarter, which
excludes the one-time effect of a class action and deferred tax
liability, will be 120 million shekels ($32 million) to 130
million shekels, according to a PRNewswire statement today.  Analysts expected fourth-quarter adjusted net income of
about 160 million shekels, according to Gilad Alper, an analyst
at Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd. in Ramat Gan,
 Israel .  The company’s board authorized management to begin
preparations for a public offering of 200 million to 300 million
shekels of debt in Israel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
