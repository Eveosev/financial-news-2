Builders began work on fewer houses
than forecast in December, capping the worst year on record for
single-family  home construction  and signaling recovery in the
industry will take time.  Housing starts dropped 4.1 percent to a 657,000 annual rate
last month, reflecting a slump in multifamily dwellings, Commerce
Department figures showed today in Washington. Building  permits ,
a proxy for future construction, were little changed.  Four years after housing helped spark the last recession,
falling  home prices  and ongoing foreclosures are hampering an
industry-wide recovery. For all of 2011, work was started on
428,600 single-family homes as construction competed with the
surfeit of previously owned dwellings.  “There’s little reason for builders to ramp up residential
construction in any strong way until we work off more of the
existing supply of homes,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist
at  Wells Fargo Securities LLC  in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , who
projected a rate of 660,000 starts for December. “There’s still
issues with foreclosures. We suspect prices are going to go down
another 5 to 6 percent, but we do expect them to bottom this year
and gradually pick up from there.”  The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for
680,000 starts at an annual rate.  Estimates (NHSPSTOT)  ranged from 625,000
to 723,000 in the Bloomberg News survey of 76 economists.  Jobless claims plunged last week to the lowest level since
April 2008, another report today showed. First-time filings for
 unemployment benefits  declined by 50,000 to 352,000, the Labor
Department said.  Stock Futures   Stock-index futures held gains after the figures. The
contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.5 percent
to 1,308.8 at 8:46 a.m. in  New York . The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note rose to 1.93 percent from 1.9 percent late
yesterday.  There were 606,900 homes started in 2011, up from the
587,000 in 2010 and reflecting gains in multifamily construction.  Permits fell 0.1 percent to a 679,000 annual rate in
December.  Housing starts in fell in three of four regions last month,
led by a 41.2 percent decline in the Northeast and a 17.6 percent
drop in the West.  New projects involving multiple housing units helped
sustained business at the end of 2011 as foreclosures turn more
Americans into renters. Work on multifamily homes, such as
apartments, townhouses and condominiums, fell 20.4 percent to
187,000 in December. For the year, multifamily starts totaled
178,300.  Single-Family Homes  Construction on single-unit dwellings increased 4.4 percent
to a 470,000 rate in December from the prior month, the highest
since April 2010. At the same time, demand for single-family
homes has waned after three years with near 9 percent joblessness
and a pipeline of distressed properties.  Homebuilders have signaled the new year will bring greater
prospects than 2011. At  Lennar Corp. (LEN) , the third-largest U.S.
builder by revenue, new orders jumped 20 percent in the three
months ended Nov. 30. Demand rose to 3,027 homes for the
company’s fourth quarter from 2,520 a year earlier.  “As I look ahead to 2012, I’m cautiously optimistic that
we’re seeing a real bottom form and that we will begin to see
signs of recovery,”  Stuart Miller , chief executive officer the
at Miami-based builder, said on a Jan. 11 conference call.  Builder Confidence  Confidence among U.S. homebuilders rose in January to the
highest level in more than four years as sales and buyer traffic
improved, according to the  National Association of Home Builders .
The Washington-based group’s index of sentiment  rose  to 25 this
month, reaching the highest level since June 2007. Nonetheless,
readings lower than 50 mean more respondents still said
conditions were poor.  Strong business for homebuilders would help propel U.S.
growth, Federal Reserve policy makers have recently said. A Jan.
5 report from central bank Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  called the
weakness in the housing market a “significant barrier” to U.S.
economic health. The next day Federal Reserve Bank of New York
President  William Dudley  outlined strategies that could prevent
foreclosures, ease refinancing of mortgages and get renters into
lender-owned properties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
