President  Barack Obama  told a group
of Jewish donors that while a lack of progress in  Middle East 
peace negotiations is disappointing, Iran’s economy is in
“shambles” due to international sanctions the U.S. has helped
impose.  “We have a united international community that is saying
to Iran, you’ve got to change your ways,” Obama said at the
fundraiser in New York City. Sanctions have been “so effective,
even the Iranians have had to acknowledge that their economy is
in shambles,” he said.  As for the Middle East, “obviously, we still have not seen
the kind of progress that I would have liked to have seen when
it comes to peace between Israel and Palestinians,” Obama said.  He said “ Israel ’s security is non-negotiable” and pledged
that the U.S. “will do everything that is necessary to make
sure that Israel is able to thrive and prosper as a secure
Jewish state.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
