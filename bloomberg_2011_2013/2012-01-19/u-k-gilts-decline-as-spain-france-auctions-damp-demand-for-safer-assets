U.K. gilts fell, pushing 10-year
yields up from a record low, as a decline in borrowing costs at
Spanish and French debt sales damped demand for safer assets.  The 10-year bond yield rose the most since November after
the U.K. sold 4 billion pounds ($6.19 billion) of five-year
notes. The difference between two- and 10-year yields widened
from near the narrowest since January 2009 as two-year
securities outperformed longer-dated debt. Britain will sell
3.75 percent bonds maturing in 2052 through banks next week. The
pound strengthened for a fourth day against the dollar.  “AAA bond yields, including those of gilts, are being
driven higher by what seems to be an improvement in sentiment,”
said Vatsala Datta, an interest-rate strategist at Lloyds
Banking Group Plc in London. “The market is also making room
for new supply. But overall, demand for top-quality  government
bonds  is still strong and the low-yield environment for gilts is
set to continue.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt rose nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 2.05 percent at 4:54 p.m. in London
after falling to a record 1.917 percent yesterday. That’s the
biggest daily increase since Nov. 25, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The 3.75 percent bond due September 2021 declined
0.805, or 8.05 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 114.805.
Two-year yields dropped five basis points to 0.38 percent.  The spread between two- and 10-year yields was 168 basis
points after shrinking to 154 basis points yesterday, the least
since January 2009 according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spain ,  France   Longer-dated gilts dropped as increasing demand at Spanish
and French bond sales added to signs the  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis is being contained.  Spain sold 6.61 billion euros ($8.53 billion) of bonds
maturing in 2016, 2019 and 2022, exceeding the maximum target of
4.5 billion euros. France sold 7.97 billion euros of notes, just
short of its maximum target, with the average yield on the
benchmark two-year notes sliding to 1.05 percent from 1.58
percent in October.  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index (SXXP)  of shares gained for a fourth
day, rising 1.2 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE-100  Index (SXXP)  climbed
0.7 percent.  The pound strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.5466. Sterling was
little changed at 83.44 pence per euro.  An index of U.K. consumer confidence fell to 38 last month
from 40 in November,  Nationwide Building Society  said today.
That’s the second lowest since the survey began in 2004. A gauge
of consumers’ expectations declined five points to 50.  U.K. Auction  The U.K. sold 4 percent notes due in 2016 at an average
yield of 0.89 percent, compared with 2.52 percent at the
previous auction of the security in July 2010.  Gilt yields will fall further as the  Bank of England 
expands its bond-purchase program to support growth, according
to Citigroup Inc. The size of its so-called quantitative-easing
program may reach 600 billion pounds by the end of this year
from 275 billion pounds now, the company said.  “Record lows for gilt yields are likely to be a regular
occurrence in 2012,” Jamie Searle, an interest-rate strategist
at the bank in  London , said today. “Policy rates are likely to
stay on hold for many years, and most importantly, the Bank of
England are likely to ramp up QE, and own around half of the
gilt market by the end of this year.”  The 10-year yield will fall to 1.5 percent by September,
Searle said, citing the bank’s forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
