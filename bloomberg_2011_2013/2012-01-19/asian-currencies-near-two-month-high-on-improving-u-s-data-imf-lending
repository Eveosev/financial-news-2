Asian currencies traded near a two-
month high after data this week showed signs of a recovery in
the world’s largest economy and the  International Monetary Fund 
sought to increase its lending capacity.  South Korea’s won rose for a third day and Indonesia’s
rupiah reached the strongest level since November as Asian
stocks jumped. Global funds bought $3.6 billion more South
Korean, Taiwanese and Indian stocks than they sold this month,
exchange data show. The Philippine peso reversed gains as policy
makers cut borrowing costs for the first time since July 2009.  “With the global stock-market gains, the overall sentiment
has shifted toward risk-on,” said Lee Jin Ill, a foreign-
exchange dealer at Hana Bank in Seoul. “Currency movements will
depend on the euro and stock markets in the near term.”  The won appreciated 0.4 percent to 1,137.38 per dollar at
the close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rupiah rose 0.2 percent to 9,051, Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.1
percent to NT$29.941 and India’s rupee strengthened 0.1 percent
to 50.3625. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index (ADXY)  reached
116.32, just below yesterday’s two-month high of 116.34.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks climbed to the
highest level since Nov. 10 after the  Federal Reserve  said
yesterday industrial production rose 0.4 percent in December
following a 0.3 percent drop in November. The IMF said it plans
to boost its lending resources by as much as $500 billion to
insulate the world economy from Europe’s debt crisis.  “We’re getting some consistent numbers showing the  U.S.
economy  is recovering,” said  Frances Cheung , a Hong Kong-based
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.  Philippine Rate Cut  The rupiah rose for a third day after Moody’s Investors
Services raised the country’s debt rating by one level on Jan.
18 to its lowest investment grade of Baa3, citing economic
resilience to external shocks.  Fitch Ratings  lifted its ranking
to investment grade on Dec. 15.  “The overall attitude towards Asian assets is good based
on the upgrading of Indonesia,” said Akira Banno, a treasury
adviser at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 43.495. Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas cut the overnight rate to  4.25 percent  from 4.5
percent, as predicted by 13 of 17 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Four expected no change.  China ’s yuan slipped 0.07 percent to 6.3167 per dollar on
slowdown concerns ahead of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday
that starts Jan. 23. The People’s Bank of China set its
 reference rate  at 6.3173, raising the fixing for a third day.  Elsewhere, the Thai baht rose 0.2 percent to 31.72 per
dollar, Malaysia’s ringgit gained 0.1 percent to 3.1065 and the
