Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s biggest
closely-held company, said its offer to buy a majority stake in
 Slovenia ’s retailer  Mercator Poslovni Siste d.d.  is valid until
Feb. 29, according to company spokeswoman Ankica Mamic.  The sale of a 52 percent stake in Mercator was put on hold
after Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d, the second-largest investor in
the Slovenian company, delayed a decision on the sale and Bozo Jasovic, the chief executive officer of Slovenia’s biggest bank,
stepped down because of pressure to stop the sale to Agrokor.  In the latest attempt to purchase the largest retail
operator in the Balkans, Agrokor said the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance
Corp, the financing arm of the  World Bank , as well as a unit of
 JP Morgan Chase (JPM)  & Co., are its partners in the takeover bid.  “The offer stands, and we are waiting for developments on
the Slovenian side,” Mamic said last night by phone.  Political leaders in Slovenia have opposed the sale
claiming it would hurt national interests and reduce
competition. The former Yugoslav republic is locked in a
political stalemate after the general elections in December
failed to produce a winner backed by a parliamentary majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
