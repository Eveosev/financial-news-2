Brightwell Holdings BV , a Turkish
private-equity firm, said it plans to bid for bankrupt Swedish
carmaker  Saab Automobile  and revive its manufacturing.  “We will make a bid very shortly, there’s no question,”
Zamier Ahmed, a board member of the Istanbul-based group, said
today in a phone interview.  Brightwell, which invests in energy, transport and
technology, wants to buy all of the Trollhaettan-based carmaker
and plans to keep production in Sweden, Ahmed said from  London .
His firm is in discussions with the administrators overseeing
Saab’s bankruptcy as well as with Saab Chief Executive Officer
Victor Muller, Ahmed said.  Saab, owned by Zeewolde, Netherlands-based manufacturer
 Swedish Automobile NV (SWAN) , filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 19 after
running out of cash. Production at the plant in Trollhaettan
stood still for most of last year starting in March. The company
can emerge from bankruptcy if a viable bidder comes along,
Muller said last month.  Brightwell will need at least two weeks before submitting
any offer as it’s still evaluating Saab’s assets, including
inventories, to decide how much to pay, Ahmed said.  Any transaction will require approval from Saab’s former
owner,  General Motors Co. (GM) , as well as the Swedish government and
the  European Investment Bank , Ahmed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
