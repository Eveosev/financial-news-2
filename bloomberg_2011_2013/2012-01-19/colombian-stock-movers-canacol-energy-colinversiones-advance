The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:27 a.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  slipped 0.1 percent to 13,451.62, while the
Colcap Index fell 0.5 percent to 1,605.35.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based  oil
company  that operates fields in Colombia, rose 2.5 percent to
1,655 pesos. The company drilled the Cachalote-1st Well in
southern Colombia with results expected in two to three weeks,
according to a regulatory filing yesterday.  Oil rose as the number of Americans filing for  unemployment
benefits  fell to the lowest level in almost four years,
indicating an economic recovery in the worldâ€™s largest oil
consumer.  Cia. Colombiana de Inversiones SA  (COLINV CB), a Colombian
electricity holding company, advanced 1.4 percent to 4,280
pesos. The shares gained 11 percent since Jan. 3 as investors
bet the company will seek to use accumulated cash on hand for an
expansion, including by participating in public bids this year
for electricity generation projects, said Jairo Agudelo, an
analyst at Celfin Capital.  Shareholders may also be buying the stock to try to get the
company back on the Colcap Index after it was removed in
October, Agudelo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
