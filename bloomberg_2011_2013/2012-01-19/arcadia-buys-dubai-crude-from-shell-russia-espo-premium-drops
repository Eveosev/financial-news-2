Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. bought 75,000
barrels of benchmark Dubai crude, while  Sudan ’s Nile Blend sold
at a higher premium and Russia’s ESPO declined.  Arcadia bought three 25,000-barrel partial cargoes from
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) , according to a survey today of traders
who monitor the Platts trading window. London-based Arcadia has
purchased 300,000 barrels of Dubai crude in January.  ONGC Videsh Ltd. (ONGC) , the overseas unit of  India ’s largest oil
explorer, sold a 600,000-barrel cargo of Sudan’s Nile Blend
crude to Japan’s  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  at a premium of about $4.50 a
barrel to ICP Minas, said two traders who participate in the
market, declining to be identified because the information is
confidential. The shipment for Feb. 16-20 sold at a higher
premium than a January cargo, which sold at $2.50 to $3 a
barrel.  Russia’s  TNK-BP (TNBP)  sold two 100,000-metric ton cargoes of East
Siberian Pacific Ocean crude, or ESPO, for loading in early
March to buyers including China International United Petroleum &
Chemical Co., known as Unipec, according to three traders who
participate in the market, declining to be identified because
the information is confidential.  The ESPO cargo was sold at a premium of $6 to $6.30 to
Dubai, down from as much as $6.50 for a cargo in February. A
second cargo was sold to Shell at a similar price, according to
four traders.  Su Tu Den  PV Oil Co., Vietnam’s state-owned oil marketing company,
sold two 300,000 to 450,000-barrel cargoes of Su Tu Den crude
for March at premiums around $8 a barrel to Minas, said three
traders who participate in the market and who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  Italy’s ENI SpA and  Japan ’s Inpex Corp. will offer two
550,000-barrel shipments of  Australia ’s Kitan crude in March,
according to two traders who participate in the market and who
asked not to be identified, citing company policy.  Dubai crude’s backwardation, when the price of early
shipments is greater than for later deliveries, narrowed. Dubai
swaps for February fell 7 cents to 94 cents a barrel more than
April, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-
based broker. A narrower backwardation implies weaker demand for
prompt oil.  Murban (PGCPMURB)  crude, produced in  Abu Dhabi , dropped 4 cents to a
discount of 24 cents a barrel below its official selling price
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Qatar Marine (PGCPQRMR) 
slid 7 cents to a discount of 50 cents, the widest since June
17, the data showed.  The spot price of  Dubai (PGCRDUBA)  fell 56 cents to $110.05 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oman futures for March
delivery rose 42 cents to $111.17 a barrel on the Dubai
Mercantile Exchange at 4:40 p.m. Singapore time, with 1,841
contracts traded. The contract settled at $111.01 at 12:30 p.m.
Dubai time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
