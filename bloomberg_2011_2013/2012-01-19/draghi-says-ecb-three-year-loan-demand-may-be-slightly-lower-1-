European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said demand for the central bank’s second three-
year loan may be slightly lower than the “very high” total of
489 billion euros ($631 billion) achieved at the first one.  “For a variety of reasons, many of which are technical, we
do expect an intake of the second LTRO quite high,” Draghi said
at a press conference in  Abu Dhabi  today. “Whether it’s going
to be higher than the previous one or slightly lower, but that’s
the sort of margin.  ‘‘We do expect something probably lower than the first, but
very high, still very high,” he said.  The ECB will offer the three-year loan on Feb. 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
