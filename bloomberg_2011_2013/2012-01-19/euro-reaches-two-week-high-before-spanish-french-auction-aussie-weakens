The euro strengthened to a two-week
high against the dollar and the yen as  Spain  raised more than
its maximum target at a debt sale, boosting optimism the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis is being contained.  The Dollar Index declined for a third day after U.S.
inflation was little changed in December, giving the Federal
Reserve more room to keep interest rates at virtually zero. The
common currency advanced versus the yen and dollar as  Greece 
held a second day of talks with private creditors in a bid to
reach an accord to lower its debt levels. Australia’s dollar
tumbled after payrolls unexpectedly shrank.  “The euro is getting a little bit of a boost from these
bond auctions,” said  John Doyle , director of markets in
 Washington  at currency-trading firm Tempus Consulting Inc.
“We’re still seeing generally positive U.S. data while  Europe 
continues to struggle and is likely headed for a recession, but
the euro has taken something like a breather from the massive
fall it had in December.”  The euro rose 0.8 percent to $1.2968 at 5 p.m. in New York
after climbing earlier to $1.2971, the strongest level since
Jan. 4. The 17-nation currency appreciated 1.2 percent to 99.99
yen and touched 100.06 yen, the strongest since Jan. 4. The
dollar rose 0.4 percent to 77.11 yen.  Europe’s shared currency has gained 2.4 percent in the past
three days against the dollar as signs the debt crisis is
stabilizing spurred demand for the region’s assets.  U.S. Policy Makers  The dollar weakened against most of its major peers as the
outlook for  interest rates  spurred investors to seek higher-
yielding assets. The central bank’s rate-setting committee meets
Jan. 24-25. It has said it will keep the  benchmark rate  at a
record low through at least mid-2013.  The U.S. consumer price index was little changed for a
second month, Labor Department data showed today in Washington.
That compared with a median forecast of a 0.1 percent gain in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. Excluding volatile food and
fuel costs, the so-called core rose 0.1 percent as projected.  Other reports showed fewer Americans than forecast filed
applications for jobless benefits last week and U.S. housing
starts dropped 4.1 percent to a 657,000 annual rate last month.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, declined 0.5 percent to 80.071 and touched
80.046, the lowest level since Jan. 5.  Krona, Krone  Higher-yielding currencies gained after the stronger-than-
forecast jobs data spurred an advance in stocks. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4 percent.  Sweden’s krona was the biggest winner among major
currencies against the dollar, appreciating 1.4 percent to
6.7496. Norway’s krone strengthened 1 percent to 5.9054 to the
greenback.  “The market has a sort of bullish momentum,” said  Mary Nicola , a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York.
“If we look at some of the key outperformers today, the
Norwegian krone and Swedish krona, they’re still performing
pretty well.”  Spain sold 6.61 billion euros ($8.6 billion) of debt due in
2016, 2019 and 2022, exceeding the maximum target of 4.5 billion
euros set for the auctions. Investors bid for 3.2 times the
amount of 2016 notes allotted, versus 1.7 times last week.
Demand for the 2022 bond was 2.2 times the amount sold, from 1.5
in November.  French borrowing costs declined as the nation sold 7.97
billion euros of medium and long-term securities.  Greek Talks  The euro also advanced as Greek Prime Minister Lucas
Papademos races to complete an accord to lower his nation’s
debt, key to a second financing package for the country.  Progress was made in the debt swap talks, Greek Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos said today. The discussions with
officials from the  Institute of International Finance , which
represents bondholders, will continue tomorrow, he told
reporters in  Athens  after the meeting.  “The euro’s rebound is very fragile, and we could well see
it starting to run out of steam very quickly,” said  Ian Stannard , head of European foreign-exchange strategy at Morgan
Stanley in  London . “There are many risk factors, including the
Greek negotiations.”  The common currency declined 3.4 percent in the past six
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-nation currencies. The yen, the top
performer, gained 7.4 percent, and the dollar rose 6.6 percent.  Aussie Falls  Australia ’s dollar weakened against all its 16 major
counterparts except the yen and the  New Zealand dollar  after the
statistics bureau said the number of workers dropped by 29,300
in December. Economists had projected an increase of 10,000. The
Aussie declined 0.2 percent to $1.0419.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, slid after the
nation’s consumer prices unexpectedly fell in the fourth
quarter. It weakened 0.2 percent to 80.29 U.S. cents.  The franc strengthened to within 0.1 percent of a four-
month high against the euro as investors bet the  Swiss National
Bank  won’t raise the currency floor imposed by former President
Phillip Hildebrand.  The Swiss currency approached its strongest level since
September, the same month the SNB capped the currency’s strength
at 1.20 per euro. Hildebrand, a former hedge-fund manager,
announced his resignation on Jan. 9.  The currency was little changed at 1.2088 per euro after
earlier reaching 1.2069. It reached 1.2063 per euro on Jan. 13,
the strongest since Sept. 20. The franc strengthened on Aug. 9
to a record 1.0075 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
