Wumart Stores Inc. (1025)  and  Lianhua
Supermarket Holdings Co. (980)  led gains by Chinese retailers on
expectations the Lunar New Year holidays starting next week
would boost sales.  Wumart advanced as much as 7.2 percent to its highest level
in almost four months, and was trading 6.6 percent higher at
HK$17.42 as of 3.09 p.m. in Hong Kong trading. Lianhua was 5.7
percent up at HK$10.70, after hitting its highest level since
Nov. 15, 2011.  Retail sales in  China  grew 17 percent in 2010, the
statistics bureau said this week. Spending in stores rose 18.1
percent in December from a year earlier, beating the median 17.2
percent estimate of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
and the 17.3 percent growth in November.  “Chinese New Year is always a busy time for retailers,”
Chang Dongliang, an analyst with Everbright Securities in
 Shanghai  said in a phone interview. “This year, we have the New
Year and the Chinese New Year in the same month, which is
definitely a big boost.” The week-long Lunar New Year holiday
kicks off on Jan 23.  Golden Eagle Retail Group Ltd. (3308)  increased 4 percent to
HK$17.28, the highest intraday level since Dec. 08, 2011.  Sun
Art Retail Group Ltd. (6808)  rose 1.6 percent to HK$9.95.  Intime
Department Store Group Co. (1833)  climbed 4.2 percent to HK$9.16.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
