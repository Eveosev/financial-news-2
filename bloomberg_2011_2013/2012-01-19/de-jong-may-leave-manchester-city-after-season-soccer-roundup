The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  De Jong Out?  Nigel de Jong may leave  Manchester City  at the end of the
season, the  Sun  reported.  The Holland midfielder, who has 18 months left on his
contract, has turned down a 33 percent increase on his current
weekly wages of 75,000 pounds ($116,000 a week).  Wellbeck’s Demands  Manchester United  has been “angered” by  Danny Welbeck ’s
demands to quadruple his wages, the  Daily Mail  reported.  Welbeck, 21, has scored eight goals for United this season.
He currently earns 15,000 pounds a week and his demand of 60,000
pounds per week has left United officials astonished, the Mail
said.  Lopez Bidding War  Fulham may have to offer as much as 6.5 million pounds for
Catania striker Maxi Lopez in order to match a bid from
Fiorentina, the  Daily Mirror  reported.  A Fulham loan bid for the player, seen as a possible
replacement for  Bobby Zamora , was rejected.  Tightened Security  Queens Park Rangers has tightened security arrangements
ahead of the F.A. Cup fourth-round match against Chelsea, the
 Daily Mirror  reported.  The Jan. 28 match marks the first time Chelsea captain  John Terry  will play at Loftus Road since he was charged with
racially abusing QPR’s Anton Ferdinand during a game in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
