Swiss stocks  climbed for a fourth
day, sending the country’s benchmark equity measure to its
highest level in more than six months, as funding costs for
 France  and  Spain  fell at auctions of the countries’ bonds.  UBS AG and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  both advanced more than 6
percent. Swiss Re Ltd., the world’s second-biggest reinsurer,
added 4.1 percent after saying Michel Lies will succeed Stefan Lippe as its chief executive officer.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, rose 1.3 percent to 6,194.45 at the
close in Zurich, its highest level since July 7. The broader
Swiss Performance Index increased 1.3 percent today.  “Bond sales, before a normal course of action, since the
downgrades of the U.S. and other countries, are in the
spotlight,” said Fabrice Seiman, chief executive officer at
Lutetia Capital, which oversees more than $100 million in Paris.  France sold 7.97 billion euros ($10.3 billion) of debt
today with borrowing costs falling in its first sale of medium-
and long-term securities since  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the
country’s credit rating on Jan. 13.  Spain sold 6.61 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2016,
2019 and 2022. It had targeted 4.5 billion euros for the sale.
Demand for the 2016 bond was 3.24 times the amount sold, the
Bank of Spain said, compared with 1.71 times at an auction of
the same security last week. Demand for the 2022 bond was 2.17
times the amount sold, compared with a ratio of 1.54 in
November.  UBS (UBSN) , Credit Suisse  UBS, Switzerland’s largest lender, jumped 8.1 percent to
12.57 Swiss francs. The stock was upgraded to “overweight”
from “equal weight” at Morgan Stanley. Credit Suisse jumped
6.8 percent to 23.90 francs.  Swiss Re added 4.1 percent to 51.60 francs. The company
said Lies, the chairman of the reinsurer’s global partnerships,
will succeed Lippe as CEO in February. Lippe announced in
December that he planned to step down.  The appointment “is somewhat unexpected, but keeps
continuity and long-standing reinsurance experience at the top
position,” Stefan Schuermann, an analyst at Vontobel Holding
AG, wrote in a note to clients today.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , the Swiss wealth manager
established in 1890, climbed 4.4 percent to 38.37 francs as
investors speculated that the bank will announce a new share
buyback program next month.  “We believe they are going to announce a new buyback on
Feb. 6 that would begin in May,”  Teresa Nielsen , an analyst at
Vontobel Holding AG in Zurich, said in a phone interview today.
“That’s what is driving the current move.”  Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN)  jumped 6.4 percent to 19.05
francs. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. listed the stock among its top
European clean energy picks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
