Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  offered to buy
back as much as $1.5 billion of subordinated bonds as the
second-largest U.S. lender seeks to cut debt and bolster
capital.  Bondholders must accept the offer by Feb. 15, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said today in a statement.
Those who tender their bonds by Feb. 1 will receive an early
tender payment of 3 percent of face value.  Bank of America is reducing long-term debt as Chief
Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan , 52, seeks to cut holdings,
expenses and staff while raising capital to meet demands from
regulators for a larger cushion against losses. The company
reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.99 billion today,
compared with a loss of $1.24 billion a year earlier.  Traders pushed Bank of America debt higher after the offer.
The lenderâ€™s $1.35 billion of 6.22 percent subordinated notes
due in September 2026 climbed 3.6 cents on the dollar to 89.4
cents at 12:22 p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The bank is offering about 95 cents for those
securities, it said in the statement.  -- With assistance from Hugh Son in New York. Editor: Shannon D.
