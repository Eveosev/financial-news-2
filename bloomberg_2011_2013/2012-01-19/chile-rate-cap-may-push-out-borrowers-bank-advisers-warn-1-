Chile’s plans to reduce the maximum
interest rate charged on consumer loans may exclude low-income
households from the formal credit market and should be
introduced gradually, central bank economists said.  “A gradual implementation process seems advisable,” the
economists wrote in a report published today. “That would
provide space for a more continuous and thorough evaluation of
the impact of modifying the rate ceiling.”  The government last year submitted a bill to lower the rate
ceiling on some consumer loans after then-bank President Jose De Gregorio said  interest rates , which can exceed 50 percent, were
a “ puzzle ” in a country where the benchmark rate is currently
5 percent. Today’s report, posted on the central bank’s website
for a congressional debate, doesn’t necessarily reflect policy
makers’ views, the bank said.  Chilean law allows banks and credit-card operators to
charge a maximum 51.4 percent a year for peso loans of up to 90
days worth less than 200 unidades de fomento, the local
inflation-adjusted accounting unit, or about $8,700, according
to data on the banking regulator website.  The finance ministry’s bill submitted in September would
set a ceiling of 1.35 times the average market interest rate on
such loans, from 1.5 times at the moment, or the average plus 12
percentage points, whichever is lower. The maximum annual rate
may fall to below 40 percent, officials have said.  The government also announced plans last year to create a
consumer protection agency specifically tailored for the
financial services industry after retailer  Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR) 
detected a $1 billion consumer credit fraud.  To contact the reporter on this story:
