Hawkpoint Partners Ltd., a corporate
finance adviser, hired Peter Kiernan, a former  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  head
of U.K. investment banking, as a vice chairman.  Kiernan has more than 25 years investment banking
experience and advised Kraft Foods Inc. on its purchase of
Cadbury Plc among other transactions, London-based Hawkpoint
said in an e-mailed statement today.  “His strong track record further reinforces the strength
of Hawkpoint’s senior advisory capability,” said Paul Baines,
Hawkpoint chairman, said in the statement.  Hawkpoint is a unit of U.K. stockbroker,  Collins Stewart 
Hawkpoint Plc. Collins Stewart advises clients on share sales
and mergers and executes trades on behalf of institutional and
private clients. The firm acquired independent advisory business
Hawkpoint in 2006.  Kiernan had been scheduled to begin a term as director
general of the London-based Takeover Panel in 2010. He withdrew
his candidacy after the regulator criticized the U.S. foodmaker
for misstating its intentions for a Cadbury plant. Kraft pledged
to keep the factory open before later moving it to  Poland .  He joined Lazard in 2004 from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
where he was responsible for the New York-based bank’s British
clients, and previously worked at UBS AG.  To contact the reporters on this story:
