The company selling real estate
built for the  London  2012 Olympic Games has shortlisted three
potential tenants to move into two media centers after the
event.  UK Fashion Hub, Oxylane Group and iCITY have been chosen as
possible tenants for the 91,689 square meters (987,000 square
feet) of space that will reopen in the second quarter of 2013,
the  Olympic Park Legacy Company  said today in a statement on its
website.  “Having already secured operators for six out of eight of
the Olympic Park venues, we are close to securing the huge 2012
legacy prize of long-term jobs and growth,” London Mayor  Boris Johnson  said in the statement.  London Olympic officials are seeking buyers for buildings
and sport facilities erected for the Games as they try to avoid
the legacy of previous host cities like  Athens  that were left
with underused or dormant structures.  UK Fashion Hub would use the site to manufacture clothing
and educate potential designers, the committee said. France-
based Oxylane Group would open a Decathlon retail store on the
premises and iCITY would develop an information technology
research center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
