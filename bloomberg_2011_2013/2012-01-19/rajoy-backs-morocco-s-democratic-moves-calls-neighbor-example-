Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
met yesterday with his counterpart in  Morocco , Abdelilah
Benkirane, and said he supported the neighboring country’s
recent moves toward greater democracy.  In his first trip abroad since being sworn in last month,
Rajoy said Morocco was at the vanguard of Arab nations and had
become “an example for many others to follow,” according to a
 statement  on the Spanish prime minister’s website. Rajoy and
Benkirane agreed to maintain a “fluid dialog.”  The two nations, which disputed the sovereignty of Perejil
Island off Morocco in 2002, plan to resume annual summits, which
were suspended since 2008, El Mundo newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
