The Swedish krona rose to a five-
week high against the dollar as French and Spanish auction
results boosted optimism  Europe ’s debt crisis will be contained,
increasing demand for higher-yielding assets.  Norway’s krone strengthened versus all but two of its 16
major counterparts as European stocks gained for a fourth day.
The euro climbed versus the dollar and the yen as French
borrowing costs fell at the auction and Spain sold more bonds
than its maximum target.  The krona and krone “have lagged other fundamentally
strong currencies, hence investors see good potential as the
euro corrects higher,” said  Carl Hammer , chief foreign-exchange
strategist at SEB AG in Stockholm.  Sweden’s currency rose 0.8 percent to 6.7885 per dollar at
4:25 p.m. London time after reaching 6.7733, the strongest since
Dec. 12. The krona appreciated 0.5 percent to 8.7563 per euro.  The Norwegian krone advanced 0.7 percent to 5.9283 versus
the dollar, and gained 0.4 percent to 7.6472 per euro.  Spain  sold 6.61 billion euros ($8.53 billion) of bonds,
compared with a maximum target of 4.5 billion euros, while
French yields fell to 1.05 percent from 1.58 percent in October
at its auction of 3 percent 2014 notes.  Benchmark interest rates are 1.75 percent in both Sweden
and Norway, compared with as low as zero in the U.S. and  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
