Peru ’s sol will appreciate at a
slower pace this year as the waning global economy curbs demand
for the country’s metal exports and damps capital inflows, said
Banco de Credito del Peru.  The currency will likely strengthen 2.1 percent from the
end of December to 2.64 per  U.S. dollar  in 2012, compared with a
4.1 percent gain last year, Peru’s biggest lender said in an e-
mailed report to investors.  The Lima-based bank forecast the Andean nation’s  trade
surplus  will shrink 4.5 percent to $7.6 billion while foreign
currency reserves will climb 9.5 percent to $53.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
