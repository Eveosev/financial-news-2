Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Russian proposals
to bolster military forces in its  Baltic Sea  exclave of
Kaliningrad would be “a waste of money.”  The Russian government has warned it may respond to the
U.S.-led plan to position parts of a  missile shield  in eastern
 Europe  by stationing its own strike missiles on its southern and
western flanks, including Iskander rockets in Kaliningrad,
located between NATO and European Union members Poland and
 Lithuania .  “These Russian statements are a matter of concern for NATO
allies,” Rasmussen told a news conference in the Lithuanian
capital, Vilnius, today. “It is a complete waste of Russian
financial resources because it is a build-up of offensive
military capacity directed against an artificial enemy. An enemy
that doesn’t exist, because NATO has no intention whatsoever to
attack  Russia .”  Russia should instead invest its resources in economic
development and the creation of jobs, he said.  “I would encourage the Russians to face the new reality,”
Rasmussen said. “We’re not enemies, we’re not adversaries, we
should be partners. It would be of mutual benefit if we
developed peaceful cooperation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
