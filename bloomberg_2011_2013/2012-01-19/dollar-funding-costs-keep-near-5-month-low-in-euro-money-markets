The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars held near the lowest level in five months,
according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was at 77
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 12:11 p.m.
in  London , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest cost since Aug. 8.  The one-year basis swap was little changed from yesterday
at 72 basis points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  rose. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was at 85 basis
points from 84 yesterday. The measure has declined from 95 basis
points at the start of the year.  Overnight deposits  at the  European Central Bank  fell with
lenders parking 395 billion euros ($508 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday. That compares with a record 528
billion euros on Jan. 17.  Three-month Euribor (EUR003M) , the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 1.195 percent, the lowest since
March, from 1.204 percent.  One-week Euribor (EUR001W)  dropped to 0.44
percent from 0.448 percent.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged at 0.561 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
