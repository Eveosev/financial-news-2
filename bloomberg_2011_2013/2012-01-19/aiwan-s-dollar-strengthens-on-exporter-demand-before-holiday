Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to its
strongest level since October amid speculation exporters are
repatriating income before the weeklong Chinese New Year
holiday.  The island’s stock and bond markets are closed today
through Jan. 27. Global funds bought $106 million more local
shares than they sold this week, taking net purchases for the
month to $1 billion, according to exchange data. Most Asian
currencies advanced today after the  International Monetary Fund 
announced plans to expand its lending resources and a pickup in
confidence among U.S. homebuilders spurred risk-taking.  “We’re getting some consistent numbers showing the  U.S.
economy  is recovering,” said Frances Cheung, a Hong Kong-based
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “Volumes are thin due to the
Chinese New Year holiday.”  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.941 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.86 earlier, the strongest level since Oct. 31.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.4 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
