Green Fuel (Pvt) Ltd. of  Zimbabwe 
will increase generating capacity to 18 megawatts within the
next six months, the  Herald  reported, citing General Manager
Graeme Smith.  By July, Green Fuel’s plant, which produces ethanol, will
consume 8 megawatts itself and plans to sell the balance to Zesa
Holdings (Pvt) Ltd., Zimbabwe’s state-owned power utility, the
Harare-based newspaper said.  The closely-held company is currently producing about 4.5
megawatts, the Herald said. Green Fuel produces ethanol from
sugar cane under an agreement with the state-owned Agricultural
Rural Development Authority, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
