Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s cargo joint
venture with  China ’s Shenzhen Airlines Co. has sent a letter to
customers telling them that flights will not start operating
again until further notice.  Jade Cargo, the venture, will ground flights until Cologne,
Germany-based Lufthansa and Shenzhen Airlines agree on a
financial restructuring, Nils Haupt, a spokesman for Lufthansa
Cargo, said by telephone.  “We hope that we will come to a solution soon because time
is pressing,” Haupt said.  Andreas Otto, the Lufthansa Cargo board member in charge of
sales, said in November that the carrier had given Shenzhen
until the end of the year to reach an agreement on plans to pour
more cash into the venture.  Germany ’s state-owned development
bank KfW Group also has a stake in Jade.  Handelsblatt, which first reported the letter to customers
yesterday, said Jade needs an investment of 50 million euros
($64 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
