Quabit Inmobiliaria SA (QBT)  climbed as
much as 40 percent in  Madrid  trading after the Spanish real-
estate company agreed to refinance almost all of its debt.  The shares rose the most since June 2011. Quabit has
refinanced “practically all” of its debt for five years by
giving lenders properties valued at 360 million ($464 million),
the Madrid-based company said today in a regulatory  filing .  “The syndicated loan has been transformed into as many
bilateral loans as lenders, giving the company more flexibility
over its assets,” Quabit said.  Spanish lenders are acquiring properties to cancel debt
from developers that are reeling from the crash in the country’s
real-estate and construction industries that started in 2008.
Quabit reported a net loss of 57.9 million euros for the first
nine months of 2011 and said it had 1.37 billion euros of debt.  Quabit was up 26 percent at 13 cents at 11:25 a.m., raising
the company’s market value to 166 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
