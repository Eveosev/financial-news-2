England wing  Chris Ashton  signed a
“long-term” contract to join Saracens next season, the
Premiership rugby team said on its website.  Ashton will move to the reigning English champion from
 Northampton Saints .  “We are obviously delighted, but for now, Chris remains a
Northampton player,” the club said. “Out of respect for
Saints, Saracens will not make any further comment on the
matter.”  Ashton, known for doing a swan dive as he scores a try, has
appeared 18 times for England. He matched a Six Nations single-
season record by touching down six times in 2011. He also
started all five games at last year’s World Cup in New Zealand,
where he tied for the tournament lead with six tries.  “I have decided to join Saracens from next season...until
then it’s all about Saints,” Ashton said on his Twitter feed.  Ashton has scored 90 tries and 452 points in 106 games
since joining Northampton from rugby league’s Wigan Warriors in
2007. He returned to the Saints on Jan. 6 following a four-week
suspension for pulling the hair of Leicester’s Alesana Tuilagi
during a Premiership match last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
