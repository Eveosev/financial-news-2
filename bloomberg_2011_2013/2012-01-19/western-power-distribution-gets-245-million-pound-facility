Western Power Distribution South
West Plc, the U.K. electricity network, signed a 245 million-
pound ($378 million) revolving credit.  The five-year facility replaces an existing 210 million-
pound line due July 2012, according to a statement from lenders.  Lloyds TSB Bank Plc and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. were
coordinating bookrunners on the deal, lenders said. The
refinancing attracted “significant oversubscription and
reduction in pricing” from its current facility, Ian Williams,
Western Power’s treasurer, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
