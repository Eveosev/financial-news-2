The  European Central Bank  said
overnight deposits from financial institutions dropped from a
record high at the start of a new reserve maintenance period.  Euro-area banks parked 395.3 billion euros ($508.4 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, down from 528.2 billion
euros a day earlier, which was the most since the euro was
introduced in 1999.  Overnight deposits tend to drop at the start of a new
 reserve maintenance period , a stretch of about a month in which
banks are required to hold a certain amount of reserves on
average. Lenders tend to front-load their ECB borrowings at the
start of the period and seek to balance their accounts toward
the end, driving up overnight deposits.  “A new maintenance period started yesterday and banks are
holding on to their money,” said Tobias Blattner, a former ECB
economist now working at Daiwa Capital Markets  Europe  in  London .
“It will go up again at the end of the current period, and
likely go through the roof after the ECB’s second three-month
loan.”  Overnight deposits were boosted by a record 489 billion
euros of three-year loans awarded by the ECB last month,
signaling banks’ unwillingness to lend the funds on. The ECB
will offer another batch of three-year loans on Feb. 28. The
current reserve maintenance period ends on Feb. 14.  Banks currently earn 0.25 percent on overnight deposits and
borrow from the ECB at 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
