Francisco Luzon, head of  Banco
Santander SA (SAN) ’s Latin American business, has resigned.  Luzon, 64, an  executive  board member of Spain’s biggest
bank, will be replaced in his Latin American role by Jesus Zabalza, his deputy in the region, the bank said in a statement
sent by e-mail today.  Luzon, named to the board in 1997, is a former chairman of
Argentaria SA, a state-owned banking group that was absorbed by
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA)  As head of the Latin
American business from 1999, Luzon ran a division that increased
profit in 2010 to 4.8 billion euros ($6.2 billion) from 546
million euros when he took on the role, Santander said.  “The bank wishes to express its recognition of the
extraordinary work Francisco Luzon has carried out in his 15
years as an executive board member and, in particular, of his
work in the Americas division, which was crucial in building the
franchise in  Latin America ,” Santander said.  Luzon who earned 1.66 million euros in fixed pay in 2011,
has a 56 million-euro pension, compared with 25 million euros in
retirement funds for Chairman  Emilio Botin  and 87 million euros
for Chief Executive Officer Alfredo Saenz, according to the
bank’s remuneration report.  Luzon’s plans were previously reported in El Pais.  To contact the reporter for this story:
