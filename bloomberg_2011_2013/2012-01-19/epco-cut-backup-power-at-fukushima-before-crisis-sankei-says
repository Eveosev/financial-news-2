Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) 
disconnected an emergency power source at its Fukushima nuclear
plant four months before the earthquake and tsunami in March
last year wrecked the station, the Sankei newspaper said.  The supply was cut during maintenance work in November 2010
and wasn’t reconnected, the paper reported, without citing the
source of its information.  The backup would have provided power for transmitting
temperature and radiation data from monitors near the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant’s reactors and helped assess the severity of the
situation once the main electricity supply was knocked out, the
Sankei said.  Tokyo Electric is checking the Sankei report and can’t
immediately comment, spokeswoman Ai Tanaka said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
