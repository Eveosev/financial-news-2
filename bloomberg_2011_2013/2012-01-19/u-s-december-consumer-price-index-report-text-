Following is the text of the
December consumer prices from the Labor Department.  Consumer Price Index  - December 2011  The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)
was unchanged in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, the
 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Over the last
12 months, the all items index increased 3.0 percent before
seasonal adjustment.  Similar to last month, the energy index declined in
December and offset increases in other indexes. The gasoline
index declined for the third month in a row and the household
energy index declined as well. The food index rose in
December, with the index for food at home turning up after
declining last month.  The index for all items less food and energy increased
0.1 percent in December after rising 0.2 percent in November.
The indexes for shelter, recreation, medical care, and
tobacco all posted increases, while the indexes for used cars
and trucks, new vehicles, and apparel all declined.  The all items index has risen 3.0 percent over the last
12 months, a decline from last month's 3.4 percent figure.
Recent declines in the energy index have brought its 12-month
change down to 6.6 percent from 19.3 percent in September.
The 12-month change in the index for all items less food and
energy held at 2.2 percent, while the 12-month change in the
food index edged up from 4.6 percent to 4.7 percent.  Year in Review  The CPI rose 3.0 percent in 2011 after a 1.5 percent
increase in 2010. This was the largest December-December
increase since 2007.  The energy index increased 6.6 percent in 2011, a
deceleration from the 2010 increase of 7.7 percent. The
gasoline index, which rose 13.8 percent in 2010, increased
9.9 percent in 2011. In contrast, the household energy index
accelerated in 2011, rising 1.8 percent after a 0.8 percent
increase in 2010. The  fuel oil  index rose 18.0 percent and
the electricity index increased 2.2 percent, although the
index for natural gas declined for the third straight year,
falling 3.7 percent.  The index for food accelerated in 2011, rising 4.7
percent compared to a 1.5 percent increase in 2010. The index
for food at home rose 6.0 percent in 2011 compared to 1.7
percent in 2010. All six major grocery store food group
indexes rose in 2011, with increases ranging from 2.3 percent
(fruits and vegetables) to 8.1 percent (dairy and related
products). The index for food away from home rose 2.9 percent
in 2011 after increasing 1.3 percent in 2010.  The index for all items less food and energy also
accelerated in 2011, increasing 2.2 percent after its
historical low 2010 increase of 0.8 percent. This was the
largest increase since 2007. Several indexes turned up in
2011. The apparel index rose 4.6 percent after a 1.1 percent
decline the previous year. Similarly, the new vehicles index
rose 3.2 percent in 2011 after a slight decline in 2010. The
indexes for recreation and household furnishings and
operations also rose in 2011 after declining in 2010. A
number of other indexes rose more quickly in 2011 than in
2010. The shelter index accelerated notably, advancing 1.9
percent in 2011 after rising only 0.4 percent the previous
year. The indexes for used cars and trucks, medical care,
education, and personal care also rose more quickly in 2011
than in 2010. In contrast, the indexes for tobacco and
airline fare posted smaller increases in 2011 than 2010.  Consumer  Price Index  Data for December 2011
Food  The food index rose 0.2 percent in December after a 0.1
percent increase in November. The index for food at home,
which fell 0.1 percent in November, rose 0.3 percent in
December as four of the six major grocery store food group
indexes increased. The index for meats, poultry, fish, and
eggs rose the most, increasing 0.7 percent, even though the
index for eggs declined. Also rising in December were the
indexes for cereals and bakery products and for nonalcoholic
beverages, each increasing 0.3 percent, while the index for
other food at home rose 0.4 percent. In contrast, the fruits
and vegetables index decreased 0.5 percent in December as the
fresh vegetables index fell 1.4 percent, and the index for
dairy and related products declined 0.1 percent. The index
for food away from home, which rose 0.3 percent in November,
increased 0.2 percent in December.  Energy  The energy index declined for the third month in a row,
falling 1.3 percent in December as all of its major component
indexes declined. The gasoline index, which fell 2.4 percent
in November, declined 2.0 percent in December. (Before
seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices fell 4.0 percent in
December.) The household energy index also declined, falling
0.4 percent in December, the same decrease as November. The
index for fuel oil fell 1.0 percent, the natural gas index
declined 0.8 percent, and the electricity index decreased 0.2
percent.  All items less food and energy  The index for all items less food and energy increased
0.1 percent in December after rising 0.2 percent in November.
The shelter index rose 0.2 percent for the third month in a
row. The rent index increased 0.3 percent and the index for
owners' equivalent rent advanced 0.2 percent. The medical
care index continued to rise significantly; its 0.4 percent
increase in December was the third in a row of at least that
size. The medical care services index rose 0.4 percent with
the hospital services index up 0.5 percent. The recreation
index increased 0.4 percent in December and the indexes for
tobacco, household furnishings and operations, and airline
fares posted increases as well. In contrast, the index for
used cars and trucks declined for the fourth month in a row,
falling 0.9 percent, while the index for new vehicles fell
0.2 percent, its third consecutive decline. The apparel index
fell 0.1 percent in December after increasing in seven of the
last eight months. The index for personal care, which rose
0.6 percent in November, was unchanged in December.  Not seasonally adjusted CPI measures  The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)
increased 3.0 percent over the last 12 months to an index
level of 225.672 (1982-84=100). For the month, the index
declined 0.2 percent prior to seasonal adjustment.  The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and
Clerical Workers (CPI-W) increased 3.2 percent over the last
12 months to an index level of 222.166  (1982-84=100). For
the month, the index declined 0.3 percent prior to seasonal
adjustment.  The Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers
(C-CPI-U) increased 2.8 percent over the last 12 months. For
the month, the index declined 0.3 percent on a not seasonally
adjusted basis. Please note that the indexes for the post-
2009 period are subject to revision.  The Consumer Price Index for January 2012 is scheduled
to be released on Friday, February 17, 2012, at 8:30 a.m.
(EST).  Redesigning the Consumer Price Index (CPI) Press Release
Tables  The format of the tables contained in the CPI News
Release will change beginning with the CPI News Release for
March, 2012, which will be issued on Friday, April 13, 2012.
News Release tables are currently available as part of the
News Release pdf and html files, and independently in html
format.  The new tables will also be available in Excel
format.  In addition, the BLS will begin issuing monthly
companion Excel files, which will contain additional index
level and CPI-W information.  These tables were made available for public comment
during October 2011.  In response to the public comments, the
BLS will issue Excel files each month, as companions to the
News Release.  There will be CPI-U and CPI-W files, and in
addition to the data contained in the News Release tables,
the Excel files will contain index values. Samples of the
companion Excel files will be available with the February CPI
News Release in March 2012. Samples of the new CPI press
release tables are available now at
 http://www.bls.gov/cpi/mock-ups.htm .  In August 2009, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
restructured the text of the CPI press release to focus on
the price movements of three broad expenditure categories,
namely Food, Energy, and All items less food and energy.
Table A within the CPI press release text was also updated in
August 2009 to reflect this new structure. Before August
2009, the text of the CPI press release had focused on eight
CPI `major groups' (Food and beverages; Housing; Apparel;
Transportation; Medical care; Recreation; Education and
communication; and Other goods and services).  While the text of the CPI press release was restructured
in 2009, seven additional CPI press release tables continued
to be published using the eight major groups. BLS has
redesigned these press release tables, to reflect the focus
on Food, Energy, and All items less food and energy. Within
these three broad categories, CPI item series will be further
divided into commodities and services. The CPI News Release
will contain these updated tables beginning with the March
2012 News Release, to be issued on Friday, April 13, 2012.  Beyond the redesign in the structure of the CPI press
release tables, several other improvements to these tables
have been made.  The new Table 1 gives a summary of the index series
which typically contribute to changes in the Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).  The new Table 2 will show the full publication stub
using the new structure for the CPI-U, including 11 new items
series that were created to augment the redesign in the
publication structure.  Table 3 will show aggregate item series (e.g.,
Transportation) that do not fall under the Food, Energy, and
All items less food and energy structure.  Table 4 will show the All items indexes at the local,
regional, and city-size class levels.  Table 5 will show the Chained Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U), and presents a history of
annual percentage changes in the C-CPI-U compared to the CPI-
U.  Table 6 will focus on 1-month seasonally adjusted
changes in the CPI-U, while table 7 will focus on 12-month
not seasonally adjusted changes.  Tables 6 and 7 will present three additional pieces of
data to help users better interpret index changes. First,
these tables will show the `effect' each item has on the
price change for All items. For example, if the effect of
food is 0.4, and the index for All items increased 1.2
percent, it can be said that increases in food prices
accounted for 0.4 / 1.2, or 33.3 percent, of the increase in
overall prices for that period. Said another way, had food
prices been unchanged, the All items index only would have
increased 0.8 percent (or 1.2 percent for All items, minus
the 0.4 effect for Food).  Effects can be negative as well.
For example, if the effect of food was a negative 0.1, and
the All items index rose 0.5 percent, the All items index
actually would have been 0.1 percent higher (or 0.6 percent)
had food prices been unchanged.  Second, standard errors for percent changes will be
shown on tables 6 and 7.  Confidence intervals for statistics
can be created using standard errors; e.g., roughly 95%
confidence intervals can be constructed using two standard
errors. For example, if an item increased 3.7 percent, and
its standard error was 0.6 percent, the 95% confidence
interval for that price change can be said to be 3.7 percent
plus or minus two standard errors, or 3.7 percent plus or
minus 1.2 percent.  Finally, each item series in tables 6 and 7 will show
the last time that item had a price change as large (or as
small) as the percent change published that period. For
example, if bananas rose 3.7 percent, and that was its
largest increase since November 2007, that would be noted in
the new tables.  In addition, most of the existing tables show the
`relative importance', or weight, of each item category as of
the previous December. The relative importance columns in the
new tables will be improved in that they will be updated
monthly to reflect the change in relative prices over time.  Finally, there will no longer be any press release
tables that focus on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage
Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). That said, the CPI-W
All items index level and percent changes will still be noted
in the text of the press release, and a companion Excel file
with CPI-W information will be available.  Expenditure Weight Update  Effective with the release of the January 2012 CPI on
February 17, 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will
update the consumption expenditure weights in the Consumer
Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and Consumer
Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-
W) to the 2009-10 period. The updated expenditure weights for
these indexes will replace the 2007-2008 weights that were
introduced effective with the January 2010 CPI release. As
originally announced by BLS in December 1998, CPI expenditure
weights will continue to be updated at two-year intervals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
