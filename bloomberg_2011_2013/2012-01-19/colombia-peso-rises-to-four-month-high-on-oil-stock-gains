Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to the highest in a week, on
concern an economic expansion may stoke inflation.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.40
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell
0.188 centavo to 120.659 centavos per peso.  Government reports today may show Colombian industrial
output increased 5.2 percent in November, while retail sales
rose 5.9 percent, according to the median estimates of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The national statistics agency is
scheduled to publish both reports at 4 p.m. Bogota time.  “Signals the economy continues to expand may be leading to
some concerns about inflation,” said Francisco Chaves, a fixed-
income analyst at brokerage Corredores Asociados in Bogota.  The economy grew 7.7 percent in the third quarter from a
year earlier, the most since the fourth quarter of 2006.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 1,825.86 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,823.10 yesterday. It has jumped 6.2 percent this year,
the best performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
