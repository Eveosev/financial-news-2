Gulf states promised to provide
Yemen with power stations able to generate 450 megawatts of
electricity to help with energy shortages in the Arab world’s
poorest nation, Yemeni Electricity Minister Saleh Sumai said.  Three facilities will be set up in different regions and
will be connected to national power stations, Sumai said in an
interview with the army’s 26 September newspaper. There were
also pledges to provide mobile power stations to cover provinces
including Marib and Sanaa, Sumai said, adding that he expected
an announcement to be made during a donor meeting on Yemen in
 Riyadh  in March.  Yemen’s state-owned Public Electricity Corporation operates
an estimated 57 percent of the country’s electricity-generating
capacity of about 1,200 megawatts as well as the national  power
grid , according to the Electricity Ministry.  The gas-powered Marib station, which began operating in
2010, was closed down after attacks by tribesmen that continue
and which, Sumai said, are politically motivated. He didn’t
elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
