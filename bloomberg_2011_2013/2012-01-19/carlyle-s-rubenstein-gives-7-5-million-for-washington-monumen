David Rubenstein , co-founder of the
 Carlyle Group LP (CG)  private equity firm, donated $7.5 million to
fix the  Washington  Monument, which has been shuttered because of
earthquake damage.  The contribution matches the amount allocated by Congress
to fix chipped stones and cracks that left the structure unsafe,
the Trust for the National Mall said today. The monument has
been closed since August, when a 5.8-magnitude earthquake
centered in Virginia rocked the capital.  “America has been very good to me, and I am humbled to be
able to honor the father of our country in this way,”
Rubenstein said of the monument, dedicated to the first U.S.
president,  George Washington .  The National Park Service plans to award a contract by
August for work that will take 10 to 12 months, the trust said.
In addition to the cracks and chipped stones, the monument
suffered from damage to the elevator and the lightning
protection system, according to the trust, a nonprofit group
that works with the Park Service to improve the mall.  “While no one was hurt, the damage to this iconic obelisk
was substantial,” said Jonathan Jarvis, director of the
National Park Service, in the trust’s statement.  The  Carlyle Group  is based in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
