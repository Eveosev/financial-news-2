The euro may advance against the
Hungarian forint as the 17-nation European currency rallies
based on technical levels, according to Lloyds Banking Group
Plc, citing ichimoku cloud chart analysis.  “So long as the support holds at the end of the week, the
trend should resume for at least one more week,” Tim McCullough, a technical strategist at Lloyds in  London , wrote in
an e-mailed report. “The rally has experienced increased
volatility in the last two months.”  McCullough said the same exhaustion patterns showing the
end of the current decline in the ichimoku chart signaled the
end of the Jan. 5 peak. The peak marked the end of a nearly six
month climb from 261.88.  The euro declined 0.4 percent to 303.80 forints at 2:20 p.m
in  New York , falling for the third straight day. It touched as
low as 301.67 forints, the least in almost a month.  McCullough said he suggests a stop-loss order at 300.18
euros per forint to protect investors if the market moves
against the trade.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows. The
conversion line plots the sum of the highest high and lowest low
during the past nine trading days. The baseline is the same
calculation during the past 26 days.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
