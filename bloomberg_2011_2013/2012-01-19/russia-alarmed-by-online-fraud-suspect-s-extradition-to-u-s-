Russia ’s Foreign Ministry said it’s
“alarmed” that Swiss and American authorities didn’t inform it
about the extradition to the U.S. of Vladimir Zdorovenin, who’s
accused of online fraud.  “Unfortunately, it’s not the first case when U.S. security
forces organize a detention of our nationals in third countries,
often on dubious grounds and using a provocation,” Alexander Lukashevich, a ministry spokesman, said today in an e-mailed
statement. “This concerns improper exterritorial application of
U.S. legislation against Russian citizens.”  Zdorovenin was arrested last March in Zurich and arrived in
 New York  on Jan. 16 after extradition by Swiss authorities,
according to a statement from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in  Manhattan . His son Kirill is also wanted and remains
at large. U.S. prosecutors charged the two Russian nationals
with taking part in a scheme to gain illegal computer access to
American bank accounts through bogus e-commerce websites.  At his Jan. 17 arraignment before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Gabriel Gorenstein, Vladimir Zdorovenin pleaded not guilty to
the charges through his lawyer, Sabrina Shroff. She declined to
comment on the case after court.  Russia has insisted consular officers are granted access to
Zdorovenin in the U.S. to guarantee his rights, according to
Lukashevich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
