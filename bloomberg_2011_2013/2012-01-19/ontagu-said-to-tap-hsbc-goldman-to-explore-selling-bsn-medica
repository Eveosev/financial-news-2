Montagu Private Equity LLP, the
London-based buyout firm spun off from  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
appointed its former parent company and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
to manage the sale of the German bandages-supplier BSN Medical,
three people familiar with the decision said.  An auction to sell the Hamburg-based company is scheduled
to start in the next few weeks, said the people, who declined to
be identified because the process is private. The disposal of
BSN may fetch about 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion), other people
said last week.  Montagu, which manages a 2.5 billion euro buyout fund and
which split from HSBC in 2003, has been looking to dispose of
the German medical equipment company for more than three years.
In 2008, it hired Morgan Stanley to lead a review, which
included a possible initial public offering or a sale, people
with knowledge of the plan said at the time. The firm bought BSN
in 2006 for about 1 billion euros, according to its website.  BSN makes general wound-care and orthopedics products, and
has operations in 25 countries with about 3,400 staff, according
to Montaguâ€™s website. It had revenue of 526 million euros in
2005.  Sky News  reported earlier today that Montagu had chosen the
two banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
