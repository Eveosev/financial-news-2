The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  rose 0.4 percent to close at 659.77 at
4:27 p.m. in New York, led by nickel.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices gained 0.6
percent to 1,570.87.  BASE METALS  Nickel climbed to a 12-week high on speculation that
economic growth in  China  will boost demand amid signs of
tightening supplies.  Russia’s OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel plans to trim output this
year, RBC Capital Markets Ltd. said in a report, citing Reuters.
Chief Executive Officer Vladimir Strzhalkovsky made the comments
in an interview on Russian television, according to the report.  On the London Metal Exchange, nickel for delivery in three

according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s equal to
$8.05 a million Btu. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures extended a rally to a record on signs of
climbing demand for U.S. beef as supplies tighten.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
