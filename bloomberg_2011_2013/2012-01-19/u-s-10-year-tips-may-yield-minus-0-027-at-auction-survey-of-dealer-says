The Treasury Department’s record
$15 billion sale of 10-year inflation-indexed securities may
draw a yield of minus 0.027 percent, according to the average
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the  Federal
Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities mature in
January 2022. The current 10-year TIPS yielded negative 0.025
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  The last offering of 10-year TIPS, an $11 billion sale on
Nov. 17, drew a yield of 0.099 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 2.64, versus 2.61 at the previous auction in
September, and an average of 2.79 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 46.3 percent of the securities
at November’s auction, compared with 30.4 percent at the
September sale.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 11.6 percent of
the notes at the November sale, versus a record 35.7 percent in
September.  Inflation-indexed notes pay interest at lower rates than
nominal Treasuries on a principal amount that’s linked to the
Labor Department’s consumer price index. Primary dealers trade
 government securities  with the central bank and are obligated to
participate in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
