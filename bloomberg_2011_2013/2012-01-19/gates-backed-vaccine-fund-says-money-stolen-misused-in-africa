A fund backed by Microsoft Corp.
founder  Bill Gates  said that as much as $6.7 million intended
for buying vaccines for children in poor countries was either
stolen or misused.  In Cameroon, as much as $4.2 million was misused between
2007 and 2010, including $1.8 million that is being investigated
for theft, the GAVI Alliance said in an e-mailed statement
today. As much as $2.5 million was misused in Niger, of which
$1.5 million may have been stolen, the Geneva-based organization
said.  GAVI joins another Gates-backed group, the Global Fund to
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, in saying it’s
investigating the abuse of money donated to improve health in
poor nations. The Global Fund said last year it’s seeking to
recover as much as $19.2 million from grants in eight countries.  “GAVI and its donors have no tolerance for any misuse,”
the organization said in the statement, adding it “will
vigorously pursue the repayment of misused funds.”  GAVI, formerly known as the  Global Alliance  for Vaccines
and Immunization, suspended some funding to the two countries
last year after discovering the misuse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
