The euro may rise to its strongest
level in a month against the dollar with a daily close above its
21-day moving average, according to Bank of America Corp.  The 17-nation currency may appreciate to $1.3080 and then
$1.3243, last reached Dec. 12, after a daily close stronger than
$1.2879,  MacNeil Curry , chief technical strategist at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in  New York , said in an interview.  “The 21-day has defined this downtrend in the euro since
early November; a close above would indicate something has
changed,” Curry said. “To get to $1.32 on the technical side
you need momentum, and on the fundamental side you need people
to think that things have changed for the better. To get to
$1.30 could be pretty easy.”  The rally would gain momentum if the Dollar Index closes
below 80.43, according to Curry. The IntercontinentalExchange
Inc. gauge, which is used to track the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, is weighted 57.6
percent to movement in the euro.  The euro appreciated to a two-week high of $1.2927 before
trading 0.2 percent higher at $1.2890 at 10:42 a.m. New York
time. It reached the 16-month low of $1.2624 on Jan. 13. The
 Dollar Index (DXY)  fell 0.1 percent to 80.372 today.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
