of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest
level in almost four years, indicating an economic recovery in
the world’s largest oil consumer.  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB)  , the biggest lender by
outlets in the East African nation, rose 0.6 percent to 16.85
shillings, the highest close since Dec. 30, as investors
speculated its valuation was more attractive than peers.  “It is attractive to foreign investors; what they look for
first is the most liquid counters and KCB and Equity Bank Ltd.
are the most liquidity in the banking sector,” Francis Mwangi,
head of research at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd.
said in a phone interview. “Then in terms of valuation KCB is
cheaper.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
