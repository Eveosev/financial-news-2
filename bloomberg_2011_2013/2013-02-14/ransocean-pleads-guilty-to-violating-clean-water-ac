Transocean Ltd . pleaded guilty to
violating the U.S. Clean Water Act for its role in the April
2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  Transocean, the Vernier, Switzerland-based owner of the
Deepwater Horizon oil rig that burned and sunk in the gulf,
agreed last month to pay a $400 million criminal fine and $1
billion in civil penalties to the U.S. The company pleaded
guilty to one misdemeanor count today in federal court in New
Orleans.  “Does Transocean wish to plead guilty to count one of the
bill of information,” U.S. District Judge  Jane Triche Milazzo 
asked the company’s lawyer at the hearing.  “It does,” Transocean lawyer Brad Brian replied.  The judge will consider whether to approve the plea at
today’s hearing.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Transocean Deepwater Inc., 13-
cr-001, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New
Orleans).  To contact the reporters on this story:
