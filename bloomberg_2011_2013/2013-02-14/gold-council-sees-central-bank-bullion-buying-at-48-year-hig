Central banks added the most gold to
reserves in almost a half century last year as prices averaged a
record, the  World Gold Council  said.  The banks bought 145 metric tons in the fourth quarter, an
eighth successive quarter of net buying, the London-based
industry group said today in a report. They added 534.6 tons to
reserves last year, 17 percent more than in 2011 and the most
since 1964, it estimates.  Nations from Brazil to Russia are adding the metal to
reserves at a time when investors are holding a near-record
amount through gold-backed  exchange-traded products . Bullion
gained for a 12th straight year in 2012, the best run in at
least nine decades, averaging $1,669 an ounce through the 12
months.  “We think that the current rate of net central bank
purchasing, driven by emerging countries, is likely to continue
to be very strong,”  Marcus Grubb , managing director of
investment research at the council, said yesterday by phone from
London. “This is very much due to a desire to diversify away
from over-reliance from the dollar and the euro.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
