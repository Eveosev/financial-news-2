Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp .,
Japan’s biggest steelmaker, said its loss widened in the first
nine months of its fiscal year after writing down the value of
two steel mills and investments were sold at a loss.  The net loss was 151.9 billion yen ($1.62 billion) in the
nine months ended Dec. 31 compared with a loss of 1.25 billion
yen a year earlier before Nippon Steel Corp. combined with
Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., according to a statement today
from the Tokyo-based company.  The company booked a one-time loss of 234 billion yen in
the nine months from an impairment charge at Nippon Steel’s
Hirohata and Sakai mills in western Japan and Sumitomo’s losses
on the sale of investment securities, the company said.  Third-quarter net income totaled 24.7 billion yen, the
company said, without providing a comparison for the previous
year before the merger in October. Four-quarter net income is
forecast at 10.3 billion yen, the company said.  The newly created company is pushing to cut costs by 200
billion yen annually after three years of integration as it
streamlines domestic facilities and reviews raw material
purchasing. The merger was designed to fend off competition from
steelmakers in China and South Korea.  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo shares were down 3.4 percent at 256
yen as of 14:02 p.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They traded at
263 yen before the earnings release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
