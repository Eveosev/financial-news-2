Farmland values in the U.S. Midwest
jumped 16 percent last year, the third-largest annual gain since
the late 1970s, as a prolonged drought drove up crop prices, the
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said.  Values in Iowa, the top U.S. corn and soybean producer
jumped 20 percent, the most among the five Midwest states, the
Chicago Fed said today in a report. Illinois, Indiana, Michigan
and Wisconsin posted gains of at least 10 percent. The rally
picked up at the end of 2012 with farmland climbing 7 percent in
the fourth quarter from the third.  The most-severe U.S. drought since the 1930s reduced the
production of corn, the biggest crop, for the third straight
year, sending the price of the grain to a record $8.49 a bushel
in August. U.S. farm profit this year may rise 14 percent to a
record $128.2 billion from 2012 as crop-insurance payments reach
an all-time high, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a
report on Feb. 11.  “2012 marked the third consecutive year of significant
jumps in agricultural land values,”  David B. Oppedahl , a
business economist at the Chicago Fed, said in the report.
“Recovery from the drought will remain a key factor in 2013, as
the movements of drought-influenced crop prices will affect both
crop farmers and livestock producers.”  Farmland values, adjusted for inflation, rose 14 percent in
2012, the third-highest in 35 years, according to the report.
About 71 percent of the 212 survey respondents projected
farmland values will be stable in the first quarter of 2013,
while 28 percent forecast an increase.  Average interest rates reached new lows in the fourth
quarter, the Fed said. As of Jan. 1, borrowing costs for-farm
operating loans were 5.03 percent, and the rate for agricultural
real-estate loans was 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
