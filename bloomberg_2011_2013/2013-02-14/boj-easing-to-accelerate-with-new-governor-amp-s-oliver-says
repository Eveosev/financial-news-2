Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has about $126
billion under management, comments on the outlook for Bank of
Japan policy following today’s decision to maintain asset
purchases. He also discussed his forecast for Japanese equities,
speaking in a telephone interview.  “Once the new governor takes over we’ll see an
acceleration of the pace of monetary easing. Valuations remain
reasonable and monetary policy will remain accommodative.  ‘‘The significance of Japan joining the fray is that it
adds to global monetary easing, with another major central bank
putting cash into the system and that puts pressure on others
others in Asia.  ‘‘The yen is probably on its way to 105 against the dollar
and this year would see the Japanese share market rise 30 or 40
percent in U.S. dollar terms. To get that degree of
outperformance probably will require the yen to fall to 105.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
