The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
was unchanged, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was unchanged at 111 basis points as of
8:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The gauge closed at its lowest level yesterday since Jan.
29, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was at 113 basis points
as of 11:09 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia Bank
Ltd. prices. The benchmark closed at 113 yesterday, the lowest
since Jan. 10, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was unchanged at 122 basis
points as of 9:23 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Citigroup Inc.
prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
