The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  rose less than 0.1 percent to settle
at 679.37 at 3:54 p.m. New York time, led by energy and
industrial metals.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  slid 0.2 percent
to 1,603.49.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil rose for the third time this week as United
Nations nuclear inspectors failed to reach a deal with Iran and
fewer Americans than forecast filed applications for
unemployment benefits.  UN officials said they didn’t secure an agreement that
would allow access to atomic facilities and couldn’t settle on a
date for another meeting, indicating that sanctions on the
country may remain in place. Gains accelerated after a report
showed U.S. jobless claims fell by 27,000 last week, signaling
fuel demand may increase.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil futures for March
delivery climbed 0.3 percent to $97.31 a barrel.  Brent oil for April settlement gained 0.1 percent to $118 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell North Sea Forties crude
with an offer at the lowest in at least a month. Glencore
International Plc and Vitol Group each sold a cargo of Russian
Urals.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline jumped to a four-month high, partly because of
falling U.S. inventory.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for March delivery advanced

Sept. 28.  Heating-oil futures for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to

sales and further signs of economic recovery in the U.S.
bolstered the outlook for demand.  On the London Metal Exchange, aluminum for delivery in
three months rose 0.7 percent to $2,157 a metric ton. Prices
earlier reached $2,166.50, the highest since Jan. 3.  Copper advanced 0.2 percent to $8,240 a ton ($3.74 a
pound). Lead also gained, while zinc, tin and nickel fell.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for delivery in
March slid 0.1 percent to $3.7375 a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn fell, capping the longest slump since 1965, as rain
improved prospects for harvests in Brazil and Argentina, while
U.S. exports lagged behind year-earlier shipments.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for May
delivery fell 0.1 percent to $6.9275 a bushel, the 10th straight
decline  Soybean futures for May delivery dropped 0.4 percent to

are getting enough moisture to boost harvests in Brazil, the

the price touched 84.05 cents, the lowest since Dec. 12.  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1.29775 a pound.  Feeder cattle futures for March settlement climbed 0.9
percent to $1.42675 a pound.  PRECIOUS METALS  Platinum dropped the most in more than two weeks after a
report showed Europe’s recession deepened more than economists
forecast, spurring concern that metal demand will ebb.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for April delivery fell 1.1
percent to 1,710.90 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery slipped 1 percent to
