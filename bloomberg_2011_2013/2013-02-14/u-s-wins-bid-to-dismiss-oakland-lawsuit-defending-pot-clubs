The Obama administration won a bid
to dismiss a lawsuit by the city of Oakland, California,
defending permits for medical marijuana clubs, including a local
pot “superstore” federal prosecutors are trying to shut.  U.S. Magistrate Judge  Maria-Elena James  in San Francisco
ruled that courts don’t have jurisdiction over the claims in the
lawsuit, and it had to be dismissed, according to a court filing
today.  Oakland sued the federal government after prosecutors filed
a forfeiture case to seize property housing the Harborside
Health Center, a six-year-old dispensary with annual gross
revenue of $20 million that offers more than 70 types of
marijuana and cannabis concentrate such as hashish, as well as
home delivery and product promotions. Prosecutors called the
center a “superstore” serving 100,000 customers in violation
of federal drug law.  The case is City of Oakland v. Holder, 12-05245, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
