Actelion Ltd. , the Swiss maker of
the Tracleer lung drug, rose in Zurich trading after proposing a
larger-than-expected dividend.  Actelion will increase its dividend by 25 percent to 1
Swiss franc per share from 80 centimes a year earlier, the
Allschwil-based company said in a statement today. Analysts
forecast a payout of 77 centimes a share, the average of 16
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The stock gained as much as 2.6
percent after the company reported earnings and sales in line
with analyst forecasts.  Profit this year will about match figures from last year,
with “single-digit percentage growth in 2014” and a double-
digit increase in 2015, Actelion said, repeating a previous
forecast. The company has applied for regulatory approval for
Opsumit, a successor to Tracleer.  The dividend increase, along with a share buyback and cost
reductions, “demonstrate the company’s drive to improve
returns,”  Peter Welford , an analyst at Jefferies International
Ltd. in London, wrote in a report today. He recommends buying
the shares.  Actelion climbed 2.3 percent to 46.52 Swiss francs at 10:10
a.m. in Zurich, giving the company a market value of 5.89
billion francs ($6.4 billion).  Core earnings rose 12 percent last year to 537 million
francs, or 3.69 francs a share, from 480.6 million francs, or
3.04 francs, a year earlier. Analysts predicted 3.70 francs a
share, the average of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue fell 3.8 percent to 1.73 billion francs, matching the
average analyst estimate.  Tracleer accounts for 87 percent of Actelion’s sales and
starts losing patent protection in 2016.  “This year brings a little more uncertainty to the
table,”  Michael Leuchten , an analyst at Barclays Plc in London,
wrote in a note today. “While bringing the product to market
shouldn’t be a challenge for Actelion, the extent of conversion
of Tracleer patients to the new product remains a question.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
