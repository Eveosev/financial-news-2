Fidelity Investments, the largest
provider of 401(k) retirement savings plans, said average
balances in the employer-sponsored accounts reached a record
high in 2012 as market gains boosted assets.  The average balance in the U.S. rose 12 percent from a year
earlier to $77,300 as of Dec. 31, according to a report today by
the Boston-based mutual-fund firm. Fidelity administers plans
for about 12 million workers and has been tracking the data
since 2000.  About two-thirds of the average-balance increase came from
market appreciation. The rest was from contributions to the
accounts, said  Beth McHugh , vice president of market insights at
Fidelity. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, a benchmark for large
U.S. stocks,  gained  13 percent last year.  “People are still contributing,” McHugh said in an
interview. “Obviously the market is helping them along the
way.”  The year-end average was 58 percent higher than in 2008,
when the global financial crisis shook equity markets. That year
the average balance plummeted to $48,900 as the S&P 500 Index
declined 38 percent.  Balances have since rebounded in three of the past four
years. The previous record high was $75,900 at the end of 2012’s
third quarter.  A 401(k) generally lets employees contribute a portion of
their wages to the account on a pretax basis. Worker
contributions are  limited  to $17,500 in 2013. Those age 50 or
older may set aside an additional $5,500, according to the
Internal Revenue Service.  Americans held  $3.5 trillion  in 401(k) accounts as of Sept.
30, according to the Investment Company Institute. The ICI is
the Washington-based trade group for the mutual-fund industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
