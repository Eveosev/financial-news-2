OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-biggest
oil producer, started construction of a $1.4 billion processing
unit at its Volgograd refinery to boost ultra-low sulfur diesel
output as exports of the fuel jumped.  The project will increase the supply of Euro-5 standard
diesel by 1.8 million metric tons a year,  Lukoil  said today in
an e-mailed statement. Exports from the Baltic port of Primorsk
may have increased to 240,000 barrels a day in January from
180,000 barrels in December, putting pressure on prices in
Europe, according to the International Energy Agency’s monthly
oil market report published on Feb. 13.  Russia is pressing oil companies to upgrade their refining
capacity in order to boost output of higher-value fuels at the
expense of fuel oil. The country’s leading oil companies,
including OAO Rosneft, Lukoil and TNK-BP, have signed agreements
with the authorities committing them to modernizing the plants.  “With over 100,000 barrels a day of Russian hydrotreating
capacity slated to come online in 2013, it is likely that ULSD
will become a more important component of Russian exports,” the
Paris-based IEA said.  The Lukoil project, which includes a hydrocracker will have
the capacity to remove sulfur from refined products, is
scheduled to be ready by the end of 2015 and is part of an
agreement with the authorities, the company said.  Euro-5 diesel contains no more than 10 parts per million of
sulfur and is the main grade used in the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
