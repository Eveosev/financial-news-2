MetLife Inc. , the largest U.S. life
insurer, fell the most in two months after fourth-quarter profit
declined 87 percent on costs tied to lower interest rates and
annuities.  MetLife slipped 2.8 percent to $36.46 at 10:54 a.m. in New
York, the most intraday since Dec. 14. The insurer  advanced  less
than 1 percent in the 12 months through yesterday, compared to
the 13 percent gain of the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index .  Operating return on equity was 11.3 percent for the year,
New York-based MetLife said yesterday in a statement, and the
firm projects a return between 12 and 14 percent by 2016.
MetLife’s 2013 projection doesn’t include buybacks since it
can’t be sure of winning regulators’ approval, even as the firm
looks to divest its bank, the company said in December. Chief
Executive Officer  Steve Kandarian , 60, declined to provide
further guidance on share buybacks, which can help boost a
company’s return on equity, in an earnings call today.  “Met may by its own choice be hamstrung in its efforts to
remove excess capital from its balance sheet,”  Eric Berg , an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said today in a note to clients.
Removing excess capital is “critical” to achieving target
return on equity, Berg said. He rates the shares sector perform.  Net income for the quarter dropped to $127 million from
$990 million a year earlier, the firm said. Operating profit,
which excludes some investing results, was $1.25 per share,
beating the $1.18  average estimate  of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
