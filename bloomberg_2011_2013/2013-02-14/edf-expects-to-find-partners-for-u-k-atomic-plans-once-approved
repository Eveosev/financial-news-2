Electricite de France SA , Europe’s
biggest power generator, is confident of finding partners to
develop nuclear reactors in the U.K. once an agreement is
reached with the government on their profitability.  “I am very comfortable with the possibilities of finding
partners, some have already come forward,” Chief Executive
Officer  Henri Proglio  said today. “We will not go ahead without
a guarantee on the profitability of our investments.”  EDF today reported the highest output in seven years from
its current U.K. reactors, acquired in 2008 when it agreed to
buy British Energy Group Plc for 12.5 billion pounds ($19
billion). Proglio’s predecessor  Pierre Gadonneix  pledged at the
time to develop at least four atomic generators from 2017.  The utility is in “intense” talks with U.K. authorities
on a price guarantee for nuclear, Proglio said today. “We think
they can conclude by the end of the first quarter,” he said.  EDF will consider partners for the projects once the accord
is reached and approved by the European Commission, the chief
executive said. The utility has already spent 480 million euros
($640 million) on the projects, demonstrating its interest.  Amid the talks with authorities, EDF in December raised the
estimated cost of developing its EPR reactor in Normandy to 8.5
billion euros, more than double the initial estimate. It has
scheduled the startup for 2016, after initially targeting 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
