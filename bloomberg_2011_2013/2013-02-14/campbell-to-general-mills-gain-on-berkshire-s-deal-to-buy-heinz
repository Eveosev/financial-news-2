Consumer stocks including  Campbell
Soup Co. ,  General Mills Inc.  and J.M. Smucker Co. advanced after
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Capital agreed
to buy H.J. Heinz Co. in a $23 billion deal.  Campbell, the world’s largest soup maker,  jumped  as much as
6 percent to $40.56 for the biggest intraday gain in more than
four years. General Mills, the maker of Cheerios cereal,
 increased  as much as 3 percent to $44.26, the highest intraday
price since at least 1980. Smucker, the maker of its namesake
brands and Jif peanut butter,  rose  as much as 2 percent to
$92.15 for the highest intraday price since at least 1988.  The gains follow the announcement of the Heinz deal, in
which Berkshire’s billionaire chairman increases his bets on
consumer products. The buyers will pay $72.50 a share for the
maker of condiments and Ore-Ida potato snacks, compared with
yesterday’s closing price of $60.48.  Investors are speculating that other large food company
purchases could happen as a result of the Heinz deal, said  Jack Russo , an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis.  “That’s exactly what’s going on,” Russo said in an
interview. “People start asking who’s going to be next?”  Russo declined to name specific takeover targets.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Consumer Staples Index rose 0.2
percent at 12:32 p.m. in New York while the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and the S&P 500 both fell less than 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
