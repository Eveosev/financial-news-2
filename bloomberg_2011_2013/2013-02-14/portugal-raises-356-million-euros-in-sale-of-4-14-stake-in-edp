Portugal raised about 356 million
euros ($475 million) by selling 4.14 percent of utility  EDP-
Energias de Portugal SA  to meet the terms of a 78-billion euro
bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.  Portugal sold 151.5 million shares in its biggest power
producer to institutions at 2.35 euros each, Lisbon-based state
holding company Parpublica SGPS SA said in a statement. Caixa-
Banco de Investimento and Morgan Stanley arranged the offer.  EDP  dropped 3.2 percent to close at 2.345 euros in Lisbon.
The stock was suspended from trading earlier today after closing
yesterday at 2.42 euros, the highest in 13 months.  Portugal, selling assets to comply with the bailout, has
also sold holdings in power-grid operator REN-Redes Energeticas
Nacionais SA and airport operator ANA-Aeroportos de Portugal SA.  Stock sold today backed exchangeable bonds issued in 2007
by Parpublica. The firm in December said it was reimbursing the
bonds after most holders exercised an option to redeem them. The
government on Oct. 31 approved the sale of 4.1 percent in EDP
through an accelerated bookbuilding or a competitive sale.  China Three Gorges Corp. Chairman  Cao Guangjing  on Dec. 20
had said his company was discussing the purchase of 4 percent in
EDP. Portugalâ€™s government in December 2011 agreed to sell 21
percent in EDP to China Three Gorges for 2.69 billion euros.  Former monopoly  EDP  is investing in dams and wind turbines
in Europe and Brazil to cut reliance on oil and coal, and tap
state incentives for alternative energy. It plans to invest 2.1
billion euros a year on average through 2015 and sees installed
capacity up 14 percent at 26.4 gigawatts in 2015 from 2011.
Hydropower and wind will be 73 percent of EDP capacity in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
