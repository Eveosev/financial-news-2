The U.S. didn’t buy or sell dollars
to affect foreign-exchange rates in the fourth quarter, the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report to Congress.  The value of the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund fell
to $24.950 billion at the end of December, from $25.766 billion
in the prior quarter, today’s report said. The fund comprises
yen and euro holdings.  The Fed’s System Open Market Account holdings of foreign-
currency-denominated assets decreased to $24.972 billion in the
quarter, from $25.788 billion on Sept. 30.  The New York Fed, which acts for the U.S. Treasury and the
Fed in the $4 trillion daily currency market, intervened in the
currency market in 2011 for the first time since 2000. The Fed
bought $1 billion of the U.S. currency on March 18, 2011, when
Group of Seven nations sought to halt the surge in the yen after
Japan was struck by the nation’s worst earthquake on record.  The central bank’s nominal trade-weighted measure of the
U.S. dollar increased 1 percent during the quarter, with the
greenback depreciating 2.5 percent against the euro and gaining
11.3 percent against the yen, the report said.  At the end of December, the Exchange Stabilization’s Fund’s
direct holdings of foreign government securities totaled $23.67
billion.  At the end of the quarter, the Fed had $8.889 billion
outstanding in reciprocal currency arrangements, most through
the dollar swap line with the European Central Bank.  The swap lines were provided by the Fed, also with central
banks of Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Mexico and the U.K., as
part of measures taken since 2007 to combat the effects of the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The emergency
liquidity tool, which provides dollars as needed, was
reintroduced in May 2010 in response to renewed demand by
overseas banks for dollar-based funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
