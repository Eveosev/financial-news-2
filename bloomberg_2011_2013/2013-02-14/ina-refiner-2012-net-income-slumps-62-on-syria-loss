INA Industrija Nafte d.d ., the
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt ., said its
2012 profit fell 62 percent from a year earlier after halting
operations in Syria.  Net income was 681 million kuna ($120 million) and revenue
was unchanged at 29.8 billion kuna. Earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization fell 30 percent to 4.5
billion kuna, the company said in a regulatory statement.  “Despite significant challenges, including the loss of
production from Syria and lower demand for key oil products, the
company achieved solid results through efforts to increase
efficiency,”  Zoltan Aldott , head of management board, said in
the statement.  INA, whose profit almost doubled in 2011 to 1.8 billion
kuna, halted its profitable gas and oil business in Syria a year
ago to comply with European Union policy on the Middle Eastern
country, engulfed in a civil war.  Mol owns 49.1 percent of the Zagreb-based refiner, while
the Croatian government holds a 44.84 percent stake. Croatia in
the last two years has attempted to increase its influence in
INA, after Mol won controlling rights to Croatia’s largest
refiner in 2009.  INA, Croatia’s fourth-biggest employer and one of the
country’s biggest investors, spent about 17 billion kuna in the
last decade to expand its operations. The company returned to
profit in 2010 following two years of losses as oil and gas
output in the northern Adriatic and Syria pushed revenue higher.  In addition to 11 exploration and production plants in
continental Croatia and 19 off-shore platforms in the northern
Adriatic that are jointly owned with Italy’s  ENI SpA  and  Edison
SpA , INA has production facilities in Syria, Egypt and Angola.  To contact the reporters on this story:
