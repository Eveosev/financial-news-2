Serbia’s central bank bought euros
for the second time this year today to slow gains in the dinar.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije purchased 5 million
euros ($6.67 million) from commercial banks to “smooth the
dinar’s intraday swings,” the bank said on its  website  without
disclosing any further details.  Three currency traders in Belgrade, who asked to remain
unidentified, in line with the policies of their banks, said the
central bank was buying euros at levels around 111.30 dinars
after the unit strengthened 0.44 percent to 110.6990. The dinar
traded at 111.3550 by 5:37 p.m. in Belgrade, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The currency has advanced because of tight monetary policy,
with the central bank raising its  benchmark interest rate  eight
times since June by a total of 225 basis points, or 2.25
percentage points, to 11.75 percent, to bring inflation back to
the target of 4 percent, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points by
the end of 2013. Inflation was 12.2 percent in December.  The dinar and Romanian leu have been among top picks for
SocGen analysts in London, including  Benoit Anne . The dinar
“has ample room to appreciate, especially with a big
credibility effort on the policy front,” they said in a Feb. 6
note to investors.  The central bank’s buying is not “part of a more
aggressive move to weaken the currency, but just to let the
market know that the NBS is there and it is not a one way bet,”
 Timothy Ash , chief emerging-markets economist with Standard Bank
Plc in London, wrote to clients today. “We have seen a number
of small interventions” recently and “I sense the bank is
eager to hold the currency in the 110-115 range.”       The
central bank last bought 5 million euros on Jan. 24 to curb the
currency’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
