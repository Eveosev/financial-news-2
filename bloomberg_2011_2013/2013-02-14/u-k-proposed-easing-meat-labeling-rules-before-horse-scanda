The U.K. proposed easing regulations
on meat products and their labeling before the recent scandal
involving horse meat discovered in beef products, a panel of
lawmakers said.  In a report published today, Parliament’s  Environment
Committee  criticized proposals that minced meat in the U.K.
should be allowed higher fat and collagen content than is
allowed in other member states, and that labels for loose meat
products shouldn’t have to declare their meat content.  “There is a risk that the consumer would have even less
clarity about what our meat contains than at present,” the
lawmakers said in the report released in London. “This is not
the time for the government to be proposing reducing the
labeling standards applied to British food.”  The U.K.’s mislabeled meat scandal has spread to Europe.
The  Food Standards Agency  has raided two British meat processing
plants, one in West Yorkshire and one in West Wales, in an
investigation into horse meat in products which were supposed to
be beef intended for kebabs and burgers.  The U.K. Department for the Environment defended proposing
easing meat labeling requirements. “These regulations are about
striking the right balance between improved information for
consumers and red tape on food businesses,” it said in an e-
mailed statement. “We will consider the consultation responses
before we make a final decision.”  The Environment Committee recommended giving the FSA more
powers to order food testing, and tighter rules around the
tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
