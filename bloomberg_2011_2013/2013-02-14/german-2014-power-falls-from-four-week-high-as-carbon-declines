German power for 2014, a benchmark
for European electricity, fell from a four-week high as coal
dropped for a fourth day.  Baseload German electricity, for delivery around the clock,
declined 35 cents to 42.55 euros ($56.77) a megawatt-hour after
rising to 43.05 euros earlier, the highest since Jan. 18,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The 2014
contract sank to a record 40.25 euros on Feb. 1.  Gains probably won’t hold because the “market is still
oversupplied, demand is still depressed and longer days will
bring heavy contributions from solar power with a likely
depressive effect on prices,”  Paolo Coghe , a Paris-based
analyst at  Societe Generale SA , said yesterday by e-mail.  Thermal coal for delivery to Antwerp, Rotterdam or
Amsterdam next year dropped as much as 0.6 percent to $98.90 a
metric ton.  In France,  Electricite de France SA  said its 2013 nuclear
outage program will be “busier” than last year and that 2013
will be marked by long outages. In Germany,  RWE AG  halted its
608-megawatt hard coal plant Gersteinwerk K2 after a boiler
fault today, the company said on its  transparency website . The
unit is scheduled to resume operations Feb. 16.  The company will idle its two 410-megawatt gas-fired units
F and G in Gersteinwerk from April to the beginning of October
as solar generation damps demand for the plants in the summer
months, a company spokesman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
