The Group of 20 nations are debating
calls to refrain from government intervention in currency
markets, Russia’s central bank First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  said.  “Delegates from international organizations and major
economies are already taking the line in their speeches that
market-determined exchange rates are an important element of
firm, stable and long-term growth and that it’s not worth
interfering with market forces,” Ulyukayev said today in an
interview in the Russian capital. He declined to predict what
the final communique will say.  The U.S. Treasury urged G-20 finance ministers and central
bankers “to refrain from competitive devaluation, according to
the Treasury’s Undersecretary for International Affairs  Lael Brainard  at Feb. 11 in Washington.  Ulyukayev said he ‘‘personally’’ supports the move.  Moving away from managed currencies is important to forming
a new model of stable economic growth, he said.  ‘‘Fiscal policy is just one part of these reforms,’’ the
central banker said. ‘‘They include a freer, more dynamic labor
market, lowering barriers to enter the market, more
competitiveness.’’  The Italian and Spanish governments have made
‘‘significant’’ strides, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
