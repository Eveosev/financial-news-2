Kenneth Heebner , who ranked as
America’s No. 1 stock picker before losing his touch, added to
his stake in Herbalife Ltd., while taking a new position in
American International Group Inc. and selling out of Google Inc.  Heebner’s Capital Growth Management LP purchased 980,000
shares of Herbalife during the fourth quarter, even as the
marketer of nutritional supplements tumbled 31 percent, based on
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The money
manager bought 710,000 shares of insurer AIG and sold $123.7
million of Google stock.  Heebner, whose  CGM Focus Fund  topped all diversified U.S.
stock mutual funds in the decade through 2007, has returned 11.3
percent this year and is ranked in the 99th percentile versus
peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Boston-based
fund’s assets plunged to $1.5 billion at the end of October from
the June 2008 peak of $10.3 billion, as it lost an annual 7.8
percent in the past five years, Bloomberg data show.  The firm also bought stock in Delta Air Lines Inc. and
United Continental Holdings Inc. after exiting from airlines in
the third quarter as the shares tumbled.  Delta  and United made
up Heebner’s two biggest new purchases in the fourth quarter.  Capital Growth sold 164,000 Google shares as the owner of
the world’s largest search engine lost 6.3 percent in the fourth
quarter. The money manager bought AIG stock as it gained 7.7
percent during the last three months of 2012. The insurer
finished repaying its $182.3 billion bailout in December.  Heebner increased his total position in Herbalife to $110.2
million in the fourth quarter and the investment firm is the
company’s seventh-biggest shareholder.  Herbalife  plunged after
hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman accused the company of illegally
operating a pyramid scheme. The shares have rallied 11 percent
this year through yesterday.  Capital Growth’s stake in financial companies still made up
the biggest allocation out of 10 industries, with Citigroup Inc.
and Morgan Stanley its largest holdings in the fourth quarter.
The company increased ownership of industrial shares the most
and also boosted holdings of consumer discretionary and raw
material producers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
