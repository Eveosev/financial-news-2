Hours-long delays at U.S. airports
may result if Congress and President Barack Obama’s
administration don’t agree to stop automatic budget cuts at two
Homeland Security Department agencies, according to a U.S. House
analysis.  The Transportation Security Administration would reduce its
front-line workforce, including seven-day furloughs for airport
screeners, Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee said
in a report today.  Customs and Border Protection, which handles security
checks for passengers arriving in the U.S. on international
flights, also wouldn’t be able to maintain staffing levels,
resulting in furloughs of between 12 days and 14 days, the
lawmakers said.  “At the busiest airports, the increase in peak airport
wait times would regularly reach three or more hours,” the
report stated.  Next month’s deadline for the cuts to take effect marks
another fiscal showdown between Obama and congressional
Republicans. Without a deal to avoid automatic cuts, $1.2
trillion in spending cuts, known as sequestration, will take
effect.  In a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee released
yesterday, Homeland Security Secretary  Janet Napolitano  said the
budget cuts would affect aviation security, roll back border
security and hamper disaster response times.  The CBP cuts would affect the agency’s ability to collect
revenue owed to the U.S. government, Napolitano said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
