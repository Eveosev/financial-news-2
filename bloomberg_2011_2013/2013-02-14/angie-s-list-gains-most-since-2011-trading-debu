Angie’s List, the consumer-review
website, surged to the highest price in more than 10 months
after forecasting sales that beat estimates as more members pay
to use the service.  The  shares  climbed 24 percent to $16.86 in New York, for
the highest closing price since April 2012. The stock has
advanced 41 percent this year, compared with a 7 percent
increase for the Russell 1000 Index.  Founded in 1995 by  Angie Hicks , the company charges fees
for access to reviews of plumbers, electricians and other
service providers. Vendors can also pay to advertise on the
site. Paid membership climbed 66 percent to 1.79 million in the
fourth quarter, and the company’s first-quarter sales forecast
of as much as $52 million suggests that user growth will
continue at that rate, according to  Jason Helfstein , an analyst
at Oppenheimer & Co.  “2013 will mark a turning point,”  Aaron Kessler , an
analyst at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a research
report. He upgraded the shares to buy and raised his target
price to $22 from $17. Helfstein increased his target to $18
from $15.  Lower marketing costs and a bigger base of paid service
providers have positioned the company to rapidly grow revenues
and boost investment in new products and technology, Kessler
said.  Sales Forecast  Angie’s List yesterday forecast first-quarter sales of at
least $51 million, beating analysts’ average estimate of $49.5
million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Indianapolis-based company reported fourth-quarter net
income of $2.43 million, or 4 cents a share, compared with a
loss of $5.87 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose
68 percent to $46.2 million, exceeding analysts’ $46 million
projection.  Angie’s List raised $114 million from an IPO in November
2011 after pricing shares at $13 apiece, the top of the proposed
range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
