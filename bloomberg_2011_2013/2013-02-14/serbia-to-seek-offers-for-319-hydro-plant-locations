Serbia will offer investors 319
locations to build hydro plants as it seeks to boost power
generation, a government minister said.  The list of projects will be announced next week and
investors will be invited to apply for permits to develop the
facilities of as much as 30 megawatts each, Energy Minister
Zorana Mihajlovic told a business forum in Belgrade yesterday.  The Balkan country needs 484 billion dinars ($5.8 billion)
to maintain and upgrade its existing hydro and thermal  plants 
through 2017 and another 235 billion dinars to add new
facilities in the period,  Aleksandar Obradovic , the acting chief
executive officer of Elektroprivreda Srbije JP, Serbiaâ€™s
