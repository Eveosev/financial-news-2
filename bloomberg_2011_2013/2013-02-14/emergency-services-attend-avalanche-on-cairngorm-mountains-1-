Emergency services are responding to
an avalanche on the Cairngorm mountains in the Highlands of
Scotland, the Northern Constabulary said on its website today.  The avalanche was first reported shortly after 12:30 pm
today in the Chalamain Gap area of the Cairngorms, the
constabulary said.  A man was airlifted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and
mountain rescue teams continued their search for two other
people following the avalanche, the police said, without
identifying the man.  Police are being assisted by members of the Cairngorm and
RAF Lossiemouth mountain rescue teams, search and rescue dogs
and an RAF helicopter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
