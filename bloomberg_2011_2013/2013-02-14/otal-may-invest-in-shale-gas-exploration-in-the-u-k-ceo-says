Total SA , Europe’s third-largest oil
company, may invest in shale gas exploration in the U.K., Chief
Executive Officer  Christophe de Margerie  said.  “We’re looking at it,” de Margerie told reporters in
London today, without providing details. The U.K. is examining
whether shale gas can compensate for the dwindling supplies from
the North Sea, he said.  Total, based in Paris, is looking to explore for shale
outside of France, where hydraulic fracturing, the extraction
method that’s raised the U.S. to the top spot in natural-gas
production, is banned. The company is in “advanced talks” with
a Chinese partner to explore in that country and expects to
start drilling in Denmark later this year. It’s also investing
in projects in Poland.  The U.K. may hold as much as 1,700 trillion cubic feet of
gas in shale formations and 20 percent may be recoverable, The
Times reported on Feb. 9, citing a forthcoming report by the
British Geological Survey.  Cuadrilla Resources Ltd. and IGas Energy Plc may be looking
for partners as they start drilling test wells in the U.K. this
year. The government lifted a moratorium at the end of last year
following earthquakes in April and May of 2011 related to
Cuadrilla’s drilling activities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
