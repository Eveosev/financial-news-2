India’s benchmark bonds gained,
pushing yields to their lowest level in a month, on speculation
slowing inflation will create room for the central bank to cut
interest rates.  Wholesale  prices rose 6.62 percent in January, the slowest
pace since November 2009, the commerce ministry said in a
statement today. The median of 34 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey was 6.98 percent. The Reserve Bank of India last cut the
repurchase  rate  by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29,
the first reduction in nine months.  “The signal WPI provides to the RBI is a positive one,
which is likely to support a continuation of easing,” Cristian
Maggio, a London-based analyst at TD Securities, said in a
research note today. “With WPI inflation declining below 7
percent and sub-par growth, while the government pushes the
reforms forward, we see the RBI reducing the repo rate by
further 50 basis points this year and perhaps more if inflation
proves more benign than we currently expect.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.82 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  Gross domestic  product  will rise 5 percent in the 12 months
through March 2013, the Central Statistical Office predicted on
Feb. 7, below last year’s 6.2 percent and the least since the 4
percent growth in 2002-2003.  As part of an economic-policy overhaul that started five
months ago, India let oil firms raise retail diesel prices on
Jan. 18 for the first time since September. The government also
allowed industries such as retail and aviation to foreign
investment.  Debt Purchase  The Reserve Bank of India will offer to buy as much as 100
billion rupees ($1.9 billion) of notes at an open-market auction
tomorrow, it said in a statement on Feb. 12. The RBI has bought
1.2 trillion rupees of securities in the year that began April
1, up from 336 billion rupees a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The open-market operations have capped yields and the RBI
is likely to infuse 300 billion rupees more by March by buying
debt,” said Vivek Rajpal, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc.
in Mumbai.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell five basis
points to 7.60 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
