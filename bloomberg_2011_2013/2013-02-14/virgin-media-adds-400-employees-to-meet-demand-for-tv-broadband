Virgin Media Inc. , the U.K. cable
television company that’s being bought by  Liberty Global Inc. ,
announced 400 new jobs to meet demand for the TiVo TV system and
broadband products.  The vacancies are in South Wales as well as Manchester and
Birmingham in England and will be advertised in coming weeks,
the company said in a statement today. The new jobs are in
addition to 60 announced for Virgin Media’s Bellshill, Scotland
office in January.  “By creating hundreds of customer-facing roles, we’ll be
able to meet the sustained appetite for TiVo, already the
leading connected TV platform in the country, and superfast
broadband,”  Paul Buttery , chief customer and networks officer,
said in the statement.  Virgin Media is being sold to Liberty Global for $16
billion, the largest media transaction since 2007. Liberty
Global Chairman  John Malone  has been using the company to expand
in markets outside the U.S. and runs pay-TV operators in
countries including Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
