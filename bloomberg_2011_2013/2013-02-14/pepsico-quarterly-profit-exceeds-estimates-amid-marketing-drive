PepsiCo Inc.  said fourth-quarter
profit rose 17 percent, helped by higher prices, and authorized
a new plan to repurchase as much as $10 billion in stock as the
world’s largest snack-food maker returns cash to investors.  Net income increased to $1.66 billion, or $1.06 a share,
from $1.42 billion, or 89 cents, a year earlier, the Purchase,
New York-based company said today in a statement. Profit
excluding some items totaled $1.09 a share. Analysts had
projected $1.05, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Indra Nooyi  has increased prices
and worked to boost sales with new products, such as Gatorade
Energy Chews and Pepsi Next. PepsiCo has spent more to market
brands including Lay’s and put a renewed focus on U.S. soft
drinks to revive lagging beverage sales and regain market share
from  Coca-Cola Co.   PepsiCo, the world’s second-largest soft drink maker,  rose 
1.1 percent to $72.28 at the close in New York. The shares have
advanced 5.6 percent this year, compared with a 1.6 percent
increase for Coca-Cola.  The company’s $10 billion share-repurchase will be from
July 1, 2013, through June 2016. PepsiCo will also boost its
annualized  dividend  by 5.6 percent to $2.27 a share starting in
June. In 2013, PepsiCo intends to pay dividends of $3.4 billion
and buy back $3 billion of its shares.  Annual Forecast  Earnings per share in 2013 will increase 7 percent from the
$4.10 in 2012, implying profit of $4.39. Analysts projected
$4.41, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Financial Officer  Hugh Johnston  said on a conference
call today that the company sees no need for large-scale
acquisitions. PepsiCo has also asked for approval from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for new sweeteners, Nooyi also said
on the call.  Any restructuring of the company’s beverage bottling
business in North America won’t be addressed until early 2014,
Nooyi said on the call. That extends a timeline Johnston laid
out one year ago, when he said PepsiCo would evaluate its
beverage distribution operations in North America through this
fall and consider whether to make changes, including
divestiture.  “We certainly wouldn’t want to make a change in the
business structure while there’s still opportunities to unlock
value that might be better unlocked while PepsiCo still owns the
business,” Johnston said in a conference call with journalists,
declining to elaborate.  Fourth-quarter  revenue  fell 1 percent to $20 billion.
Analysts projected $19.7 billion, on average.  PepsiCo Americas Foods volume grew 6 percent in the
quarter, helped by acquisitions and higher sales of Frito-Lay
products in North America.  Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, said Feb. 12 that  net income 
rose 13 percent to $1.87 billion as sales of non-carbonated
drinks in North America such as Powerade helped counter lower
demand in Europe. Revenue advanced 3.8 percent to $11.5 billion,
less than analysts estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
