Manchester United, the soccer team
that leads the English Premier League by 12 points, said second-
quarter profit declined 61 percent because of a tax charge.  Profit from continuing operations was 16.2 million pounds
($25.1 million), or 10 pence a share, in the three months ended
Dec. 31, compared with 42.1 million pounds, or 27 pence, in the
year-earlier period, the team said in a statement. Revenue rose
8.7 percent to 110.1 million pounds after six new sponsorship
deals.  The record 19-time English champion’s commercial revenue
rose 29 percent to 35.6 million pounds, including sponsorship up
49 percent to 20.8 million pounds. That may get better, after
United said it has a new eight-year agreement for its training
uniform with an undisclosed sponsor. It ended a pact with
delivery company DHL early to allow talks with other firms.  United said the new sponsor will announce details of the
agreement “in the near future.”  Manchester United is having “extremely strong growth
particularly in sponsorship,”  Ed Woodward , executive vice-
chairman, said in the statement. The agreements were with
Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co., the beverage group owned by China’s
richest man  Zong Qinghou , China Construction Bank Corp. and
other companies in Asia.  United said a 12.1 million-pound non-cash tax charge,
compared with a 22.9 million-pound tax credit in the previous
second quarter, cut into this period’s results.  Champions League  United tied 1-1 at Real Madrid last night in the Champions
League round of 16. The deciding part of the two-game contest is
at Old Trafford in Manchester on March 5. United leads the
Premier League with 12 games remaining with defending champion
Manchester City in second place.  The northwest England team’s owners, the U.S.-based Glazer
family, held an initial public offering on the New York Stock
Exchange in August, raising $233 million by selling 10 percent
of the 135-year-old club at $14 per share. That was below the
initial marketed range of as much as $20. The shares were down
0.9 percent at $18.55 at 12.50 p.m. in New York trading.  United said borrowing declined to 366.6 million pounds at
the end of the year compared with 439 million pounds at the end
of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
