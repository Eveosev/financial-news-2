US Airways Group Inc.  and AMR
Corp.’s American Airlines are combining after playing separate
roles in the U.S. industry’s first two big tie-ups of the 21st
century.  The consolidation began in 2001 when AMR bought  Trans World
Airlines Inc.  US Airways Chief Executive Officer  Doug Parker ,
who pulled off a merger in 2005, said in 2011 he saw “one big
deal left” after a hostile bid for Delta Air Lines Inc.
collapsed in 2007 and two rounds of talks failed with former
United Airlines parent UAL Corp.  Completing the merger between Tempe, Arizona-based US
Airways and American will trim the number of U.S. carriers with
overseas networks and full-service cabins to three from seven at
the start of the last decade.  The following is a timeline of successful combinations
among major U.S. carriers since 2000.  January 2001: AMR agrees to buy then-bankrupt TWA in a deal
eventually valued at $2.8 billion. The purchase pushes Fort
Worth, Texas-based  American  ahead of United as the world’s
largest carrier. The transaction closed in April 2001.  May 2005:  America West Holdings Corp. , then led by Parker,
agrees to merge with bankrupt US Airways using $1.57 billion
from backers including planemaker Airbus SAS and hedge fund Par
Capital Management Inc. The deal was completed in September
2005.  April 2008: Delta agrees to acquire  Northwest Airlines Corp . in
a stock swap eventually valued at $2.75 billion. The tie-up,
which was completed in October 2008, makes Atlanta-based Delta
the biggest carrier by traffic.  May 2010: United parent UAL and  Continental Airlines Inc.  agree
to combine in an all-stock merger eventually valued at $3.47
billion. The deal puts together the third- and fourth-largest
U.S. carriers by traffic, vaulting the new Chicago-based  United
Continental Holdings Inc.  past Delta as the world’s biggest
airline. The United brand survives. The transaction closed in
October 2010.  September 2010: Southwest Airlines Co. agrees to buy  AirTran
Holdings Inc.  in a cash-and-stock transaction eventually valued
at $1 billion. The deal allows Dallas-based  Southwest  to add
flights outside the U.S. for the first time and gives the low-
cost carrier a hub in Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport. The
transaction closed in May 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
