New Jersey Transit , the nation’s
largest statewide mass-transit network, will expand its new
ticket vending-machine technology that allows it to dispense
change in the form of paper bills instead of dollar coins.  The service is available beginning today at Newark Penn
Station, after successful testing over the past year at New York
Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal and on the
Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system. It should be system-wide by the
end of 2013, Executive Director  James Weinstein  said.  “By equipping our ticket vending machines with this new
technology, we will further improve the ticket purchasing
experience for our customers while also reducing cash handling
costs for NJ Transit,”  Weinstein said in a statement.  Once fully implemented, the technology is expected to save
$1.2 million annually, according to the statement.  Hurricane Sandy brought New Jersey Transit service to a
standstill. The Oct. 29 storm flooded rail yards in Kearny and
Hoboken, damaged 62 of the agency’s 203 locomotives and left 261
of its 1,162 cars in need of repair. It also washed out some of
the system’s 500 miles (805 kilometers) of rail tracks, brought
down overhead wires and flooded control panels.  The agency is still working to repair damage caused by
saltwater that breached the Mason power substation in Hoboken,
spokesman John Durso said. Bus and light-rail service has
returned to pre-Sandy levels and the agency hopes to restore
full rail service by March, he said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
