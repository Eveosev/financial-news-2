R. Allen Stanford’s former chief
accounting officer, Gilbert Lopez, 70, was sentenced to 20 years
in prison for helping to conceal Stanford’s $7 billion Ponzi
scheme.  U.S. District Judge David Hittner imposed the sentence
today in Houston. Also set for sentencing is Stanford’s former
controller, Mark Kurht, 40. The men were convicted in November
of conspiring to hide Stanford’s fraud.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
