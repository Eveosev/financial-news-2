Iranian officials held a funeral
today for a Revolutionary Guards commander who they said was
killed by supporters of Israel on his way to Lebanon from Syria.  Iranian authorities held the funeral for General Hassan
Shateri in a mosque in the Iranian capital, the state-run  Fars 
news agency reported. Shateri was killed by “backers of the
Zionist regime” as he travelled to Beirut from Damascus, Fars
said earlier today, citing Ramezan Sharif, public relations head
of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps.  Shateri headed an Iranian agency in charge of
reconstructing areas of Lebanon that had been demolished during
the 2006 war between the Islamic militant group Hezbollah and
Israel, Sharif said, without giving details of the circumstances
surrounding his death.  Iran is Syrian president  Bashar al-Assad ’s closest
supporter and also backs Hezbollah, a major Shiite militia force
and political party in Lebanon. Hezbollah, initially created
with the help of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in the 1980s, has
waged several armed conflicts to end Israel’s occupation of
Lebanese territory. The U.S. and Israel consider the group a
terrorist organization.  Shateri’s funeral was attended by top Iranian officials
including Guards chief  Mohammad Ali Jafari  and Ali Saeedi,
Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ’s representative to the
elite force, Fars said. Shateri will be buried tomorrow in his
hometown, Semnan, the state-run  Press TV  news channel reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
