Angola, Africa’s second-biggest oil
producer, will start an electronic bond market within months and
a stock market within two years, central bank Governor  Jose de Lima Massano  said.  “We are going to have this set up during the first half,”
Massano, 43, said in an interview yesterday at his offices in
Luanda, the capital. “It will be done through the Capital
Markets Commission, not the central bank.”  While some local companies may need more time to meet
requirements on financial reporting and transparency, the nine
largest domestic banks in the country are ready to list on a
stock exchange, he said. Angola has 23 registered domestic banks
and 10 units of foreign financial companies, according to the
website of the central bank.  A stock market has been discussed for more than a decade by
policy makers in the southwest African country rebuilding from a
27-year civil war that ended in 2002. Banco Regional Do Keve SA,
an Angolan lender, raised $20 million of subordinated debt in
the nation’s first corporate bond sale in September.  The project has “momentum” because the government has
studied the market, installed much of the infrastructure and has
the support of the International Monetary Fund and officials
from the U.S. Treasury Department, Manuel Alves de Rocha, an
economist at the Catholic University of Luanda, said in an
interview this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
