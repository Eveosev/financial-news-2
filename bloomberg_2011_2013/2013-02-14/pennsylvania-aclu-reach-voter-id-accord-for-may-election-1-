Pennsylvania and the American Civil
Liberties Union agreed to a compromise on voter identification
for May elections before a trial still set for July on the
merits of the state’s law.  Voters will be able to cast ballots without photo ID in the
May 21 primary and any special elections before that date under
the temporary accord, the ACLU said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. The agreement extends an October ruling by
Commonwealth Court Judge Robert Simpson that barred enforcement
for the presidential election.  “In-person voters will again be asked for ID but will not
be required to show it,” the ACLU said in the statement.  Pennsylvania is one of nine states that passed laws ahead
of the November election requiring each voter to show a state-
issued ID before casting a ballot. Enacted in March 2012 and
backed by Pennsylvania Governor  Tom Corbett , a Republican, the
law requires prospective voters to present a state-issued ID, or
an acceptable alternative such as a military ID.  The state’s photo ID requirement could have excluded as
many as 759,000 eligible voters, or about 9 percent of the
state’s electorate, from the recent election, according to an
analysis conducted last year by the Pennsylvania Department of
State.  A trial in the case is scheduled to begin July 15 with a
decision by mid-August.  The case is Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
330-md-2012, Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania (Harrisburg).  To contact the reporter on this story:
