Asian  stocks  rose after the Bank of
Japan maintained its asset-purchasing program before its
governor steps down next month. An unexpected contraction in
Japan’s economy fueled speculation policy makers will boost
efforts to end deflation.  Asahi Group Holdings Ltd.  advanced 5.8 percent as the
biggest beer maker in Japan by market share said it will buy
back as much as 4.3 percent of its stock and forecast profit
will rise 15 percent.  Alumina Ltd.  soared 7.5 percent in Sydney
after Citic Resources Holdings Ltd. agreed to buy a stake in the
company for A$452 million ($468 million). Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. lost 2.2 percent as earnings declined on
charges at its Australian and Philippine businesses.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  climbed 0.3 percent to 133.64
as of 6:24 p.m. in Tokyo. About four shares advanced for each
three that fell. Hong Kong’s market reopened today while China,
Taiwan and Vietnam remain shut for the Lunar New Year.  “Once the new governor takes over, we’ll see an
acceleration of the pace of monetary easing,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of strategy at AMP Capital Investors
Ltd., which has about $126 billion under management.
“Valuations remain reasonable and monetary policy will remain
accommodative. We’re starting to transition into a phase where
global growth picks up and that transfers through to earnings.”  Bank of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  and his colleagues
left monetary policy unchanged, as forecast by all 20 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, while raising their assessment for
the economy. Shirakawa and his two deputies step down on March
19.  Inflation Target  The central bank last month set a 2 percent inflation
target urged by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, while stopping short
of immediate action to achieve it. The BOJ pledged to begin
open-ended asset purchases next year to stimulate the economy.  Japanese gross domestic product contracted an annualized
0.4 percent in the three months through December, following a
revised 3.8 percent contraction in the previous quarter, the
Cabinet Office said in Tokyo today. The median forecast of 32
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 0.4 percent
growth.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.5 percent and Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.9 percent. Australia’s  S&P/ASX
200 Index  advanced 0.7 percent, to the highest level since
September 2008. South Korea’s Kospi Index added 0.2 percent and
Singapore’s Straits Times Index lost 0.1 percent.  Relative Value  The Nikkei climbed 8.2 percent in 2013 through yesterday,
compared with a 6.6 percent gain on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index. This year’s 3.1 percent advance through yesterday on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional equities gauge,
left the measure trading at 14.8 times average estimated
earnings compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.4 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The continued high level of optimism is a concern and
markets may be vulnerable to bad news, but valuation support
suggests any correction should be short and shallow,”  Michael Hartnett , New York-based chief global equity strategist at Bank
of America Corp., wrote in e-mailed comments.  Of the 308 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific index that
have reported earnings this quarter and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 53 percent exceeded profit expectations. Some 52
percent missed sales projections. That compares with 74 percent
of S&P 500 companies that topped profit forecasts during the
period, while 34 percent fell short of sales estimates, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the S&P 500 dropped 0.1 percent. The gauge
gained 0.1 percent yesterday to the highest level since October
2007 as investors weighed economic reports and President Barack
Obama’s State of the Union address.  Asahi gained 5.8 percent to 2,125 yen. The Japanese brewer
of Super Dry increased it full-year net-income forecast 15
percent to 65.5 billion yen ($703 million).  Alumina soared 7.5 percent to A$1.29. The purchase by Citic
Resources, a Chinese oil and coal producer, of a A$452 million
stake in Alumina makes it the Australian company’s biggest
shareholder.  Nippon Prologis REIT Inc. , a real estate investment trust
set up by the world’s largest owner of industrial buildings,
surged 24 percent to 682,000 yen on its Tokyo trading debut amid
expectations for growing demand for warehouses.  SingTel slid 2.2 percent to S$3.52 as net income dropped to
S$827 million ($669 million) in the three months ended December,
missing the S$907 million average of four analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Alacer Gold Corp. slid 4.2 percent in Sydney to A$3.84 as
gold fell 0.2 percent to $1,642.10 per ounce, weakening the
company’s earnings outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
