The U.S. is poised to become a net
exporter of liquefied petroleum gases for the first year ever as
shale-based energy production jumps, prompting new orders for
specialized ships to haul propane and butane.  Daily LPG  shipments  equated to a record 194,000 barrels in
last year’s first 11 months, outpacing  imports  at 169,700
barrels, U.S. Energy Information Administration figures show.
That’s the first time the country was a net exporter in records
going back to 1973, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Total seaborne trade in LPG will come to 100.6 million
metric tons this year, up about 16 percent from 2010, estimates
by German transportation lender DVB Bank SE show. U.S. exports
will exceed 5 million tons this year, against 3.7 million tons
in 2012, before reaching 7 million tons next year, London-based
shipbroker Braemar Seascope Ltd. predicts.  “After that, it’s anybody’s guess,” Nick Wright, a
shipbroker at Braemar who specializes in organizing charters for
gas carriers hauling LPG, said by phone Feb. 13. “Some have
predicted they’ll be as much as 20 million tons by 2020.”  LPG is a byproduct from refining oil and purifying natural
gas, according to the EIA. Hydraulic fracturing, known as
fracking, of shale rock formations from Texas to West Virginia
has boosted U.S. supplies of gas. LPG, used to manufacture
petrochemicals and also for heating and cooking, is converted to
liquid form for shipping by pressurization and cooling to minus
42 degrees Celsius (minus 44 degrees Fahrenheit).  More Vessels  Increased U.S. production is leading to orders at shipyards
for vessels designed to transport LPG as well as other
petrochemical gases including ethane, said Stephen Wilson,
director of Braemar Seascope’s gas department.  “We are seeing a game-changer because of this era of shale
gas,” Wilson said in a Feb. 8 interview. “The extra production
planned of LPG and petrochemical gases is going to have a major
impact, but nobody’s 100 percent sure of what types of ships
will be needed and numbers required.”  BW Group Ltd. has 12 very large gas carriers that haul
propane and butane, the biggest fleet, data from IHS Fairplay
show. The Bermuda-based shipowner owns 47 gas carriers of all
types, according to its website.  Billionaire  John Fredriksen  was among shipowners who
ordered eight VLGCs in the last six months as shipyard prices
fell as low as $62 million from the high of $95 million in 2006.
Each vessel can hold 80,000 cubic meters (2.83 million cubic
feet) of cargo.  2015 Deliveries  The fleet of 150 VLGCs will swell by 13 ships this year and
a further 10 in 2014, Braemar’s Wright said. Orders for another
four vessels have yet to be confirmed, he said, predicting
deliveries of the carriers in 2015.  Evergas, a Copenhagen-based shipper of petrochemical gases,
last month ordered vessels that can haul ethane or liquefied
natural gas from the U.S., Vice President Ralph Juhl said in an
interview Feb. 13. He gave no information on the order’s size.  Petrochemical manufacturer Ineos Group Holdings will
charter the ships, each with a capacity of 27,500 cubic meters,
under long-duration accords once they enter service starting in
2015 to transport ethane to Norway from the U.S., Juhl said.  LPG from the U.S. is cheaper than the biggest suppliers in
the Middle East, which account for about 35 million tons a year
of the estimated 85 million-ton global seaborne trade, according
to Braemar.  Benchmark Voyage  The cost to ship 44,000 tons of LPG to Japan from Saudi
Arabia, the benchmark route, advanced 0.6 percent to $40.59 a
ton, according to the Baltic Exchange, a London-based assessor
of freight costs. Rates gained in eight of the 10 sessions so
far this month after averaging $38.75 in January, the lowest
since October 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  VLGCs will be able to navigate the expanded Panama Canal
once wider locks under construction open in 2015, according to
Braemar. Access to the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans will shorten voyage times, in turn cutting shipping costs
and reducing the expense of exporting LPG to Asia from the U.S.,
the shipbroker says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
