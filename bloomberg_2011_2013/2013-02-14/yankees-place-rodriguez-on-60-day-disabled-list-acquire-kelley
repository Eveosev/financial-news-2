The New York Yankees placed third
baseman  Alex Rodriguez  on the 60-day disabled list, the Major
League Baseball team said.  Rodriguez, 37, is missing spring training to stay in New
York and rehabilitate from last monthâ€™s hip surgery. The Yankees
signed third baseman  Kevin Youkilis  in December as a replacement
for Rodriguez, who probably will miss at least the first three
months of the season.  The Yankees also said yesterday that they had acquired
right-handed pitcher  Shawn Kelley  from the Seattle Mariners in
exchange for minor-league outfielder Abraham Almonte.  Kelley, 28, was 2-4 with a 3.25 earned run average in 47
appearances with Seattle last year. He had 45 strikeouts in 44
innings. During parts of four seasons with the Mariners, Kelley
has a 10-9 career record with 3.52 ERA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
