Gasoline jumped to a four-month high
as March contract’s discount to April futures narrowed for the
first time in four days.  The March-delivery gasoline gained 2 percent. The March-
April spread shrank 2.44 cents to 21.2 cents, after reaching the
widest in seven years yesterday for the contracts nearest to
expiration on speculation winter-grade supply is ample. April
futures represent summer-grade fuel, which costs more to refine
and blend. East Coast supplies rose last week while total U.S.
inventories fell, Energy Information Administration data show.  “It’s surprising that gasoline continues to rally,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“National inventories drew this week due to the lower
inventories in PADD 5 while RBOB on the East Coast in PADD 1
built substantially.”  Gasoline for March delivery advanced 6.11 cents to $3.0965
a gallon at 12:21 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
volume that was 50 percent above the 100-day average. Gasoline
has been the top performer this year on the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI  commodity index .  The contracts are based on reformulated gasoline, or RBOB.
Gasoline stockpiles in the East Coast, or PADD 1 region, which
includes the Nymex delivery point in New York Harbor, jumped 1.7
million barrels to the highest level since March 16 last week,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.
Total U.S. supplies fell 803,000 barrels to 233.2 million.  April-September  April gasoline’s premium over September widened 2.46 cents
to 27.38 cents a gallon, indicating concern that supplies will
drop heading into the peak period for U.S. driving demand, which
typically starts in late May.  “The concern specifically is a shortage of blending
components, which you need more for summer,” said Amrita Sen,
chief oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research
consulting company in London. “Petrochemicals are running at
max capacity because of cheap natural gas and they’re also
looking for cheap feed stock.”  Hess Corp.  will shut its Port Reading, New Jersey, plant
later this month. Lipow estimated that the refinery can produce
50,000 barrels a day of the motor fuel and represents 7.7
percent of PADD 1 gasoline-making capacity.  “The market is expecting tight RBOB supplies in the Harbor
because Hess Port Reading will be shut down and it doesn’t see
much resupply of summer-grade RBOB out of Europe this summer,”
Lipow said.  Heating oil for March delivery rose 0.48 cent to $3.2236 a
gallon on the Nymex. on volume that was 8.4 percent above the
average.  Inventories of  distillate fuels , including heating oil and
diesel, declined 3.68 million barrels to 125.9 million, the EIA
reported. Heating oil supplies in PADD 1 increased 430,000
barrels.  The  retail  price for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 1 cent to $3.628 a gallon, the highest level since Oct. 22,
AAA said today on its website. Costs have climbed 10 percent
this year and are 11.5 cents above a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
