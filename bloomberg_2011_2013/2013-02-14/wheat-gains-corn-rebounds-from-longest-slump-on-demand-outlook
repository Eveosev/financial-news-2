Wheat rose for a second day in
Chicago on speculation demand will rebound for U.S. supplies
after prices reached a seven-month low yesterday. Corn gained
after nine sessions of declines.  Wheat plunged 22 percent from a four-year high achieved in
July and corn slumped 18 percent from a record as global grain-
production prospects improved after the worst U.S. drought since
the 1930s hurt crops. Iraq is seeking to import 50,000 metric
tons of wheat with bids due by Feb. 17, the Trade Ministry said.
Bangladesh, the largest buyer in South Asia, aims to buy 50,000
tons with bidding closing Feb. 28.  “Chicago wheat is now the cheapest,”  Michael Pitts , a
commodity sales director at National Australia Bank Ltd., said
from Sydney today. “That’s going to attract some demand. Demand
has still been decent for global wheat generally.”  Wheat for delivery in March added 0.5 percent to $7.3925 a
bushel by 6:35 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Yesterday the
grain touched $7.225, the lowest since June 25. In Paris,
milling wheat for delivery in May rose 0.2 percent to 237.25
euros ($316.25) a ton on NYSE Liffe. The contract was about
$1.14 a bushel more expensive than Chicago futures for the same
delivery month.  In the week ended Feb. 7, 22.45 million bushels of U.S.
wheat were inspected for export, 46 percent more than a week
earlier, while corn export inspections more than doubled to
14.46 million bushels, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.  Corn for delivery in May was 0.3 percent higher at $6.9525
a bushel in Chicago. The contract slid 6.5 percent in the
previous nine sessions, the grain’s longest losing streak since
December 1980. The USDA on Feb. 8 predicted bigger-than-expected
corn and soybean harvests in Brazil and Argentina, where output
is rebounding after dry weather last season.  Soybeans for delivery in May fell 0.2 percent to $14.11 a
bushel. Yesterday the oilseed touched $13.935, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Jan. 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
