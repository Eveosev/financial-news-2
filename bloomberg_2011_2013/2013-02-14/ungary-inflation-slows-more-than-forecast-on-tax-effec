Hungary’s  inflation  rate dropped
more than forecast to the lowest in 16 months in January as
value-added tax increases from a year ago faded from the index,
adding to arguments to keep cutting borrowing costs.  The inflation rate was 3.7 percent in January, the lowest
since September 2011, the Budapest-based statistics office said
today. The median estimate of 18 economists in a Bloomberg
survey was 3.9 percent. Prices rose 0.8 percent from December.  Outgoing central bank President Andras Simor has been
outvoted along with his two deputies on rate cuts by non-
executive members who want to spur an economy battling its
second recession in four years and who forecast meeting policy
makers’ 3 percent inflation target in the medium-term. The bank
on Jan. 29 lowered the two-week deposit rate by a quarter-point
for a sixth month to 5.5 percent, the lowest since 2010.  The drop in the January inflation index was primarily
caused by the high base from a year ago due to value-added tax
increases, statistician Borbala Minary told reporters today. The
effects of a 10 percent cut in household energy prices from Jan.
1 will show up in the inflation rate next month, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
