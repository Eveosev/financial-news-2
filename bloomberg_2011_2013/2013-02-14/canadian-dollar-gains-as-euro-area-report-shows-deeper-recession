The Canadian dollar gained the most
versus the euro since the beginning of the year after a report
showed Europe’s recession deepened more than economists forecast
last quarter, sapping demand for the region’s assets.  The currency approached parity against the U.S. dollar
ahead of a two-day meeting between Group-of-20 finance ministers
and central bankers scheduled to start tomorrow in Moscow. It
rose against the greenback for a third day after a report showed
weekly U.S. jobless claims fell more than forecast.  “The Canadian dollar has done fairly well, especially
against the euro,”  Blake Jespersen , managing director of
foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal, said in a telephone
interview. “Generally speaking, people are somewhat optimistic
about global growth this year, especially in some of the
emerging market and commodity economies, so you’re seeing a
boost from that.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 0.1 percent to $1.010 per
U.S. dollar at 8:49 a.m. in Toronto. The loonie gained as much
as 1 percent versus the euro, its biggest intraday increase
since Jan. 2. One Canadian dollar purchases 99.87 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
