George Soros  made almost $1 billion
since November from bets that the yen would tumble, according to
a person close to the billionaire’s $24 billion family office.  The Japanese wager helped the firm return about 10 percent
last year and 5 percent so far this year, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the firm is private. The yen has
weakened 17 percent versus the dollar since about the start of
the fourth quarter, the worst performance over a similar period
since 1985.  The yen slumped and Japanese stocks rallied as Prime
Minister  Shinzo Abe  pressed the Bank of Japan to introduce
additional stimulus measures. BOJ Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  and
two deputies will step down next month, allowing Abe to pick
leaders to implement his plan for expanded monetary easing.  Scott Bessent, chief investment officer at New York-based
Soros Fund Management LLC, also has 10 percent of the firm’s
internally managed portfolio betting on rising shares in Japan,
said the person. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index has
jumped about 28 percent since the end of September.  Bessent worked for Soros in 1992 when Soros and his chief
strategist Stan Druckenmiller made a $10 billion bet that the
Bank of England would be forced to devalue the pound. That wager
netted $1 billion. At the time Soros’s Quantum fund was $3.3
billion.  Bessent left the firm in 2000, and returned to be CIO in
2011.  Michael Vachon , a spokesman for the firm, said he couldn’t
comment on the trades, which were reported yesterday by the Wall
Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
