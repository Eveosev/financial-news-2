Treasury bonds rose for the first
time in four days as a report showing the euro-area recession
deepened fueled demand before a $16 billion auction of the debt.  The securities being sold yielded 3.20 percent in pre-
auction trading, compared with 3.07 percent at a  previous
auction  of similar-maturity debt on Jan. 10. The euro-area
economy shrank 0.6 percent in the final three months of 2012,
the worst performance in almost four years, as output slumped in
its three biggest economies.  “The weak global economic reports gave the Treasury market
a bit of a boost, but we still have the 30-year auction to
contend with, which is always a wild card,” said  Sean Murphy , a
trader at Societe Generale in New York, one of the 21 primary
dealers that are required to bid at government debt auctions.
“The market likes to see price concession heading into long
bond auctions.”  The U.S.  30-year bond yield  dropped three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.21 percent at 11:35 a.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.75
percent security due November 2042 rose 14/32, or $4.34 per
$1,000 face amount, to 91 7/32.  Claims Drop  Treasuries pared gains after a government report showed
claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 27,000 the most in a
month, to 341,000 in the period ended Feb. 9, compared with
366,000 a week earlier. The forecast was for a drop to 360,000,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Investors submitted  orders  to buy 2.77 times the amount of
available 30-year debt at last month’s bond auction, the
strongest bid-to-cover ratio since November.  “The overnight news around the world was very weak
underscoring weak global growth, which has led to safe haven
buying,” said  Jason Rogan , director of U.S. government trading
at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for
institutional investors. “The lack of a concession before the
auction is a concern as inflation fears have risen of late and
with it, a fear of higher rates. But there is enough concern
from economic and political risks as well as Fed purchases, that
continue to support demand.”  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 37.8 percent of the bonds at the
January sale, versus 33.7 percent at the December auction. The
average for the past 10 offerings is 35.26 percent.  Market Returns  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.7 percent of
the securities at last month’s sale, less than the average 15.66
percent at the past 10 auctions.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 5.24 percent this year,
compared with a 1.12 percent decline in the broader U.S.
Treasuries market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes.  “Perhaps all the emotions in the air along with the
upcoming concerns over the fiscal fight part 2, will lead to a
rekindling of the tactical-based affair with long bonds,”
 George Goncalves , head of interest-rate strategy at Nomura
Holdings Inc., a primary dealer, wrote in a note to clients.
“We love the bond in the near-term and expect a solid to strong
auction which will trigger some curve flattening.”  The U.S. sold $24 billion of 10-year debt yesterday at a
yield of 2.046 percent and auctioned $32 billion of three-year
notes on Feb. 12 at a yield of 0.411 percent.  The auctions will raise $8 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $64 billion, according to
the Treasury.  To contact the reporters on this story:
