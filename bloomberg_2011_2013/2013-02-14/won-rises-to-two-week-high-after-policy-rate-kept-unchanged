The won strengthened after South
Korea’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged
and before a meeting of the Group of 20 nations at which leaders
may express concern about competitive currency devaluations.  The South Korean currency rose for a third day to a two-
week high after the Bank of Korea kept the seven-day repurchase
rate at 2.75 percent today, a move predicted by 14 of 15
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The yen erased early
gains and touched 93.64 per dollar after a former central bank
official said it needed to weaken to help achieve the nation’s
inflation target.  “The market is watching the dollar-yen moves and the BOK
won’t cut unless the yen weakens to 95 per dollar,” Han Sung
Min, a currency trader in Seoul at Busan Bank, said after the
rate decision. “People are just waiting for the G-20 meeting to
see if they will try to stop the yen weakness.”  The won gained 0.3 percent to close at 1,083.59 per dollar
in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,083.35, the strongest level since Jan. 30. One-month implied
volatility for the won, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, fell 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, to 7.4 percent.  Against the yen, the won climbed 0.2 percent to 11.58 per
yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has rallied 17
percent against the Japanese currency in the past three months
and reached 11.575 on Feb. 12, the strongest level since October
2008. A stronger won erodes the competitiveness of South Korean
exporters such as Hyundai Motor Co. and Samsung Electronics Co.  Benchmark Rate  The Bank of Korea kept its benchmark interest rate on hold
for a fourth month after the economy grew at an annual rate of
1.5 percent in the final quarter of 2012, trailing economists’
forecast for a 1.8 percent gain. Unemployment climbed to 3.2
percent last month versus 3 percent in December, the government
said yesterday.  “Borrowing costs at the current level are accommodative,
supporting the economy,” Lee Sung Kwon, an economist at Shinhan
Investment Corp. in Seoul, said before the decision. “Still,
policy makers may want a rate cut as early as next month if
exports tumble on a weak yen.”  The won pared gains after a former Bank of Japan official
Kazumasa Iwata said the yen needed to weaken to achieve the
official inflation target of 2 percent. An exchange rate of 90
to 100 yen per dollar reflects a return to equilibrium, he said
in Tokyo today.  Japan is punishing its trading partners by guiding the yen
weaker, Eisuke Sakaibara, a former Ministry of Finance official
said in an interview yesterday. That means the currency’s slump
will be in the spotlight at the G-20 meeting in Moscow beginning
tomorrow, he said.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent notes due December
2015 was unchanged at 2.73 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
