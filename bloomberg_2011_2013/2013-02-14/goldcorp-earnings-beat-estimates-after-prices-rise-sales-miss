Goldcorp Inc. , the second-biggest
gold miner by market value, reported fourth-quarter earnings
that beat analysts’ estimates after mining costs rose less than
expected.  Net income increased to $504 million, or 47 cents a share,
from $405 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier, the Vancouver-
based company said yesterday in a statement. Profit excluding
one-time items was 57 cents a share, topping the 55-cent average
of 21  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined 5.3
percent to $1.44 billion, missing the $1.56 billion average of
eight estimates.  Goldcorp, led by Chief Executive Officer  Chuck Jeannes , is
among gold producers facing rising prices for labor, raw
materials and equipment. The company’s average cost to produce
and sell gold was $621 per ounce, compared with $529 in the
fourth quarter of 2011. The average of four analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was for $654 an ounce.  “We view the 4Q release as largely a non-event to slight
positive given the good cost performance,”  Brian Yu , a San
Francisco-based analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in a note
yesterday.  Goldcorp  produced  700,400 ounces of gold in the fourth
quarter, compared with 687,900 a year earlier. The company
struggled last year with seismic activity that affected output
at the Red Lake mine in Ontario, its top producer, and water
shortages at the Peñasquito operation in Mexico.  ‘Strong Finish’  “Excellent quarterly performances at our two largest mines
resulted in a strong finish to 2012 and position Goldcorp for a
much improved 2013,” Jeannes said in the statement yesterday.
“Red Lake in Canada benefited from full access to higher grade
gold zones while Peñasquito in Mexico performed well despite
commencing mining in a new, lower-grade phase of the pit during
the quarter.”  The company, which is building three new mines, in Canada
and Argentina, lowered its forecast for 2013 production to a
range of 2.55 million to 2.8 million ounces on Jan. 7, from 3.2
million in January 2012.  Gold, which has risen for 12 straight years, averaged
$1,719.36 on the Comex in New York in the fourth quarter, 1.9
percent more than a year earlier and 3.8 percent higher than in
the previous three months.  The metal slumped below $1,600 an ounce today for the first
time since August as signals on the U.S. economy spurred
optimism, eroding demand for the precious metal as a store of
value.  Goldcorp declined 2 percent to C$33.99 at the close in
Toronto. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s biggest gold producer,
dropped 1.9 percent to C$31.82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
