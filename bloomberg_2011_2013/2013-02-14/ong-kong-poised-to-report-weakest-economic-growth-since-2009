Hong Kong is poised to announce its
weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis even
as property-price gains fuel asset-bubble risks.  Gross domestic product may have increased about 1 percent
last year,  K.C. Chan , the financial services secretary, said at
a function in the city today, according to a government
transcript. That would compare with 4.9 percent in 2011.  Officials are balancing the need to stoke growth with
efforts to cool a housing market that the International Monetary
Fund said last year is at risk of an abrupt correction. The
government is set to announce fourth-quarter GDP figures and
this year’s budget on Feb. 27 amid signs of improvement in the
global economy.  “I believe this year’s economy will be better than last
year’s, but it is full of challenges,” Chan told reporters
after the event to mark the first business day after a Chinese
New Year holiday.  Hong Kong is among economies with pegged currencies that
need to be on alert for dangers such as asset bubbles,  Jan Hatzius , chief economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said at a
briefing in the city on Feb. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
