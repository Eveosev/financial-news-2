Serbia’s  Commission for Protection
of Competition  said  Sunoko d.o.o. , the country’s biggest sugar
producer, may buy Greece’s  Hellenic Sugar Co. SA  if it sells one
of Hellenic’s two plants in Serbia.  The Novi Sad, Serbia-based company, part of  MK Group
d.o.o. , has sought to buy Hellenic Sugar to expand output and
exports from its four sugar plants that currently cover 50
percent of the market. The purchase was approved on condition
that “in the case of a successful bid,” Sunoko sells one of
Hellenic’s two plants in Serbia to keep its share of sugar-beet
processing in the country to 65 percent, the regulator said in a
statement on its  website .  The Commission also said that Sunoko will need to submit
detailed semi-annual reports to the authority about its
production and sales, including prices at which it sells sugar
in Serbia and abroad, until Serbia lifts all sugar import
duties.  The regulator decided against the possible purchase in
January 2012, after which the Belgrade-based Administrative
Court overturned the decision in August. The Competition
Commission said that it changed its position after Sunoko
stopped selling sugar abroad at lower prices than on the
domestic market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
