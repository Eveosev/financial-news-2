Aluminium Bahrain BSC  expects demand
for the metal to increase this year as Saudi Arabia and other
Middle Eastern countries spend more on housing, while sales will
also rise in North America.  “The physical demand this year looks healthy,” Chief
Executive Officer  Tim Murray  said today on a conference call.
Aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange may average $2,000
in the first six months of 2013 and rise as high as $2,200 in
second half, according to the state-run company known as Alba.  The Persian Gulf metals producer is moving ahead with a
planned $2.5 billion expansion to add a sixth pot line, or
production facility. A feasibility study for the project will be
completed in the third quarter, Murray said. Sovereign wealth
fund Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Co. holds a 69 percent stake.  “Financing appetite for pot line six looks good from
international banks,” he said. Alba hired BNP Paribas SA as an
adviser to assess the company’s financing options for expanding
its smelter.  Aluminum smelters burn natural gas, and Bahrain’s
government has yet to allocate supply for Alba’s planned
expansion. With its gas reserves declining, the island kingdom
is considering importing liquefied natural gas to help meet
local demand.  Alba, which buys all its gas from the government at a fixed
price, doesn’t yet know what it will have to pay this year,
Murray said, without elaborating on the price it pays now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
