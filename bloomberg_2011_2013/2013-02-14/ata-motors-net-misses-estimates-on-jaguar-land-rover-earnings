Tata Motors Ltd. , India’s biggest
automaker, posted profit that missed analyst estimates as costs
climbed and increased demand for its lower-priced Evoque model
cut earnings at the Jaguar Land Rover Ltd. unit.  Third-quarter  net income  fell 52 percent to 16.3 billion
rupees ($302 million), the lowest in three years, the Mumbai-
based company said. That lagged behind the 29.3 billion-rupee
median of 40  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Profit
at the luxury unit declined 25 percent to 296 million pounds
($459 million), trailing analysts 310.5 million-pound median
estimate.  Jaguar Land Rover last month said that its lower-priced
Evoque model attracting a higher share of buyers may have
stalled profit growth. Tata Motors’s luxury unit also said in
January it may have negative  free cash flow  in the year
beginning April 1 as it raises annual capital spending to 2.75
billion pounds from 2 billion pounds to develop models and build
a factory in China.  “The losses at the domestic business will pull down the
gains at Jaguar Land Rover, together with the decrease in
margins due to the unfavorable product mix,”  Mitul Shah , an
analyst at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd., said before the earnings
announcement. “We are positive about volume growth, but it is
still to be determined how margins will increase.”  Product Mix  The average selling price of vehicles such as the Jaguar
XF, Land Rover Freelander and the best-selling Evoque is about
30,000 pounds compared with the 42,000-pound average for its
other models, Vijay Somaiya, head of treasury at Tata Motors,
said in a briefing on Jan. 24.  The luxury unit’s deliveries increased 10 percent to 94,828
vehicles in the three months ended Dec. 31. Of this, Jaguar
accounted for 15,043 units and Land Rover for 79,785 vehicles,
the company said today.  Sales of Jaguar Land Rover rose 1.5 percent to 3.8 billion
pounds, according to the statement. That lagged behind the 4.11
billion-pound median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Tata Motors  fell 2.5 percent to 297.20 rupees at close in
Mumbai, before the earnings announcement. The shares have
dropped 4.9 percent this year, compared with a 0.4 percent
increase in the benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index. The
company’s  American depositary receipts  tumbled 4.9 percent, the
most since Jan. 23, to $27.25 at the close in New York.  Most Expensive  The automaker began selling a new version of its most
expensive model, the 71,300-pound Range Rover last year. The
model, built completely out of aluminum, will see higher
deliveries this quarter as production volume expands, Somaiya
said at the time. It will also introduce a new version of its
50,000-pound Range Rover Sport this year, he said.   Net sales  of Tata Motors, including units, increased 1.4
percent to 458.2 billion rupees in the three months ended Dec.
31, according to the statement. That lagged behind the 488.2
billion-rupee median of 40 analysts’ estimates.  Total costs, including of materials, wages and product
development, rose 6 percent to 425 billion rupees, according to
the statement.  Operating profit  margin  at the unit was 14 percent in the
quarter, lower than a year earlier, reflecting the product mix
and higher marketing costs, Tata Motors said. “Launch costs of
the all-new Range Rover, run out of the earlier Range Rover, and
continued growth in product investments and related costs to
support future business growth” also impacted profitability.  Emerging Markets  Jaguar Land Rover is turning to emerging markets such as
China, Russia and South Africa to pursue growth. Global sales in
2012 rose 30 percent to 357,773 vehicles, with those in China
surging 71 percent to 71,940 units, Jaguar said last month.
China surpassed the U.K. to become its largest market.  The luxury unit, together with Chery Automobile Co., is
investing 10.9 billion yuan ($1.75 billion) to build a
manufacturing plant in eastern China. The venture will include a
local brand as well as a research & development center and an
engine plant.  Jaguar Land Rover is also studying the feasibility for a
plant in Saudi Arabia, it said in December. The luxury unit said
last year it is expanding Jaguar Land Rover assembly at the
company’s factory in Pune, located in the western state of
Maharashtra in India.  Fitch Ratings assigned Jaguar Land Rover’s $500 million
notes a final BB- this week.  The ratings are constrained by the automaker’s “limited
product portfolio, its shorter operating history and lower
volumes compared with more established and highly rated premium
car manufacturers,” Fitch said in a statement dated Feb. 12.
“The prevailing weak global economy may also pose a challenge
in maintaining volume growth over the next one to two years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
