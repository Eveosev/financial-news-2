Slovenia’s failure to fully
implement a plan to clean up lenders’ balance sheets would
probably force the nation to seek a bailout, Finance newspaper
 reported , citing former Finance Minister  Janez Sustersic .  The best solution out of the political crisis sparked by
corruption allegations against Prime Minister  Janez Jansa  would
be early elections, Sustersic, who resigned from his post last
month, was quoted as saying by the Slovenian business daily.  Slovenia devised a bank recapitalization plan that would
take as much as 4 billion euros ($5.36 billion) in bad loans
from lenders such as Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. in exchange for
government-guaranteed bonds. An additional 1 billion-euro direct
capital boost for banks would also be needed, Sustersic has
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
