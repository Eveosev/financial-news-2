Brazil’s swap rates dropped as
consumer prices in Sao Paulo rose less than economists forecast
and Europe’s recession deepened, fueling speculation that the
central bank will refrain from lifting borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 decreased
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.12 percent at
10:08 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real depreciated 0.1 percent to
1.9670 per dollar.  Consumer prices in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s biggest city,
climbed 1.01 percent in the four weeks ended last week,
Foundation Economics Research Institute reported today. The
median forecast of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
1.07 percent increase. Europe’s economy contracted the most in
almost four years.  “Interest-rate futures should fall, especially in the
shortest part of the curve, reacting to the FIPE inflation
number and frustration with growth in European economies,”
 Octavio de Barros , the chief economist at Banco Bradesco SA,
wrote in an e-mail message.  Gross domestic product in the euro area fell 0.6 percent in
the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the most
since the first quarter of 2009, the European Union’s statistics
office reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
