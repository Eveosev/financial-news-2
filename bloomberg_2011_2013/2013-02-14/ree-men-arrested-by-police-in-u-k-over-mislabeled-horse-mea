Three men were arrested at two meat-
processing plants shut down by the U.K. food-industry regulator
over the sale of mislabeled horse meat.  A 64-year-old and 42-year-old man were arrested at Farmbox
Meats near Aberystywth, Wales, and another man, 63, was arrested
at the Peter Boddy Slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire,
according to an e-mailed statement from police and the Food
Standards Agency.   The arrests were made in relation to suspicion of offenses
under the Fraud Act, according to the statement. Operating
approvals for both companies were suspended yesterday by the
food safety agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
