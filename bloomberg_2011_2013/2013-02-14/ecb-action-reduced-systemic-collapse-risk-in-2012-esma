Action by the European Central Bank
to ease funding for governments helped reduce so-called systemic
risk last year, the European Union’s top markets regulator said.  The ECB’s pledge to buy up sovereign bonds in the secondary
market, which began in August, “reduced uncertainty among
market participants,” the Paris-based  European Securities and
Markets Authority  said in an e-mailed statement.  The agency said investors remain “very sensitive to any
new information on distressed European markets’ sovereign
debt.”  “ESMA’s risk analysis points to important first signs of
easing in EU financial markets, but risks remain high and
regulators, market participants and investors should remain
vigilant,”  Steven Maijoor , ESMA’s chairman, said in the
statement.  Yields on  Spanish debt  have declined from a high of 7.75
percent on July 25 to 5.19 percent after the ECB announced its
bond-buying program, called Outright Monetary Transactions. The
plan, which would cover notes with maturities of between one
year and three years, enticed investors back to higher-yielding
assets that they abandoned during the Europe’s debt crisis.  ESMA also said that the demand for high-rated collateral
will grow faster than the supply over the next two years, making
it “comparatively scarcer,” the watchdog said.  The amount of available collateral rated BBB- or higher is
estimated to increase by 800 billion euros ($1.07 trillion) by
2014, while demand will grow by 2.4 trillion euros as stricter
rules on derivatives and bank liquidity take effect, ESMA said
in its report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
