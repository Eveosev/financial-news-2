Chile’s peso dropped from a three-
week high as a deepening recession in Europe boosted demand for
a refuge in the dollar.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 471.21 per U.S.
dollar at 10:28 a.m. in Santiago. The peso closed yesterday at
470.65, the strongest level since Jan. 24.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
raised their net bets against the currency to $1.9 billion on
Feb. 12, a $1.3 billion increase from Jan. 31.  Gross domestic
product  in the euro area fell 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter
from the previous three months, the worst performance since the
first quarter of 2009.  “The weakness in Europe is worse than expected, and that
tends to lead to great caution from investors who seek refuge in
the dollar,” said  Sebastian Senzacqua , an economist at Bice
Inversiones in Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
