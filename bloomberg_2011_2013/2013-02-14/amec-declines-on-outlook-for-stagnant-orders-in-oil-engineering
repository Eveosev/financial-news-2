Amec Plc , a U.K.-based oil and gas
engineer, fell the most in 18 months in London trading after
saying its order book is unlikely to change this year.  Amec  dropped 7.3 percent to close at 1,042 pence, the
biggest one-day decline since August 2011, after forecasting a
similar volume of orders in 2013 to last year’s 3.6 billion
pounds ($5.6 billion). Profit margins shrank to 8 percent in
2012 from 9.2 percent, the company said today in a statement.  European oil-service providers have seen margins squeezed
as higher crude prices boost competition, driving up costs in
the industry.  Saipem SpA , the region’s largest provider, said
last month that 2013 earnings would be less than half expected
levels because of delays to contract awards, reduced operations
and less profitable agreements with customers.  About 4.2 million Amec shares traded today, more than 
triple the three-month daily average.  The company reported a 28 percent jump in annual sales to
4.2 billion pounds and said it expects “low-to-mid single
digit” revenue growth this year. Margins will improve
“gradually,” it said.  “The relatively lackluster outlook statement could see
consensus for 2013 fall, creating some short-term weakness,”
Oriel Securities Ltd. said today in a note, keeping its  add 
rating on the stock.  Amec, based in London, increased its dividend by 20 percent
to 36.5 pence a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
