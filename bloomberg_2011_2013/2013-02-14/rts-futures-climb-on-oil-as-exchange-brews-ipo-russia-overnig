A rally in crude oil stoked gains in
Russian  stock futures  as the Moscow Exchange prepared to sell
shares in what is being targeted as the biggest initial public
offering on the nation’s bourse since 2007.  Futures expiring in March on the dollar-denominated RTS
Index rose 0.3 percent to 158,850 in U.S. hours and the ruble
extended an advance against the  dollar-euro basket . The
 Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index  of the most-traded Russian
stocks in the U.S. fell for the first time in three days.
American depositary receipts of  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel  slumped
to an eight-week low.  Crude, which together with natural gas contributes about 50
percent of Russian budget revenue, climbed 0.3 percent as United
Nations nuclear inspectors failed to reach a deal with Iran and
U.S. jobless claims plunged. The Moscow Exchange is seeking at
least 15 billion rubles ($498 million) in the sale, which would
make it the biggest IPO on Russian markets since OAO Polymetal’s
$630 million offer in 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “High oil prices make everyone who invests in Russia,
regardless of sectors, feel better,”  Mansur Mammadov , who helps
manage $100 million in Kazimir Partners Ltd., said by phone from
Moscow yesterday. “The Moscow Exchange IPO is a very good
opportunity for long-term investors and revives interest in
Russia even among those who don’t participate.”  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Index  of Russian companies listed
in the U.S. declined 0.9 percent to 103.71, the lowest level
since Jan. 23.  Metalloinvest Talks  Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest producer of the metal,
was the worst performer on the Bloomberg Russia-US gauge,
dropping 4 percent to $18.62 in the biggest retreat since June
21. The stock fell 3.6 percent to 5,673 rubles, or the
equivalent of $188.40, in Moscow yesterday.  Billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s Metalloinvest, which already
holds 4 percent of Norilsk Nickel, is in preliminary discussions
with other Norilsk shareholders about swapping Metalloinvest’s
Udokan copper deposit for shares of Norilsk, three people said,
asking not to be identified because the information is private.  The Moscow Exchange narrowed the price band for its initial
public offering to 55 rubles to 57 rubles as investors bid at
the low end of the initial range, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter.  The bourse, which runs Russia’s 50-stock Micex and dollar-
based RTS indexes, said Feb. 4 it plans to sell shares at 55
rubles to 63 rubles. The stock will trade on its own platform,
after marketing in the U.S., Europe and Russia. A sale at the
bottom of the range would value the company at $4 billion.  CTC Gains  CTC Media Inc ., Russian television company, rose 1.3
percent to $10.33, the highest level since Feb. 4. CTC TV, the
company’s main television station, saw its average daily
audience increase in the week to Feb. 10, regaining the fourth-
most-watched rank among viewers, TNS Global said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  Yandex NV , Russia’s biggest Internet company, increased 2.6
percent to $25.66, the highest level since April, as trading
volume almost doubled from the daily average over the past three
months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Credit Suisse Group AG increased its price estimate on the
shares to $33 from $29, reiterating a rating equivalent to buy.  “We like Yandex for its solid technological platform and
strong execution in Russia despite competitive threats,”  Olga Bystrova , an analyst at Credit Suisse in Moscow, wrote in an e-
mailed report yesterday.  ETF Slips  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, decreased 1.1 percent to $30.32,
the biggest drop in a week. The  RTS Volatility Index , which
measures expected swings in the stock futures, declined 1.3
percent to 21.51.  Crude oil for March delivery in New York climbed to $97.31
a barrel. Brent oil for April settlement increased 0.1 percent
to $118 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
while  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export blend, fell 0.3 percent
to $116.21.  The ruble weakened 0.1 percent to 30.10 per dollar
yesterday and gained 0.3 percent to 34.6360 against the dollar-
euro basket used for minimizing swings that hurt exporters.
Ruble futures show the currency 0.1 percent stronger at 30.247
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
