Ukrainian authorities will open the
flight recorders today from a passenger plane filled with soccer
fans that crashed while landing in Donetsk, killing five people,
Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Vilkul said.  The government will prepare a resolution on paying
compensation to the families of the deceased, Vilkul said today
in televised remarks to reporters in Donetsk, about 730
kilometers (454 miles) southeast of the capital, Kiev.  The An-24 aircraft operated by Odessa, Ukraine-based
airline TOV Pivdenni Avialinii lost control during a landing at
the Donetsk airport last night. Most of the charter flightâ€™s 44
passengers were flying in to attend a Champions League soccer
match between Shakhtar Donetsk and Borussia Dortmund, the
Interfax-Ukraine newswire reported.  Nine others injured in the crash were taken to hospital,
said Donetsk regional Governor Andriy Shyshatskyi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
