Zurich Insurance Group AG ,
Switzerland’s biggest insurer, said fourth-quarter profit rose
82 percent after higher capital gains on investments.  Net income increased to $983 million from $540 million a
year earlier, the Zurich-based company said today in a
statement. That beat the $521.1 million average estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Business operating profit fell
to $540 million from $983 million in the year-earlier quarter.  Zurich Insurance  will keep its dividend unchanged at an 11-
year high of 17 Swiss francs ($18.52) a share, after increasing
the payout to that level in 2010. Net capital gains on debt and
equity investments were $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter
compared with a loss of $78 million in the year-earlier period.  “Results were better than expected, but only on the bottom
line, which was clearly due to higher realized capital gains,”
said  Daniel Bischof , a Zurich-based analyst with Helvea. “For
me the operating profit is more important, and there they were
rather disappointing because of the general insurance
business.”  Net capital gains on investments totaled $2.2 billion in
2012, driven by sales of debt and equity securities.  “We continue to execute our proven strategy, growing our
business in emerging markets while delivering a resilient
performance in mature markets,” Chief Executive Officer  Martin Senn  said in the statement today. “This strong underlying
profitability ensures we remain well positioned to continue to
deliver for our customers, employees and shareholders in 2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
