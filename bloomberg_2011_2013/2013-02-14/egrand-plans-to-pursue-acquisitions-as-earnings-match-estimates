Legrand SA , the world’s largest
maker of wiring devices, said it has the financial strength to
spend more than 500 million euros ($666 million) on acquisitions
this year after reporting record earnings in 2012.  “Generally we spend 400 to 500 million euros a year on
acquisitions without affecting our balance sheet, thanks to a
strong cash flow,” Chief Executive Officer  Gilles Schnepp  said
at a press conference today. “It’s a model that has worked
well, but if you look at our history there are years when we
spent more. There are no taboos.”  Legrand’s debt fell 15 percent last year to 1.08 billion
euros as net income climbed 5.6 percent to 505.6 million euros,
the company, based in Limoges, France, said in a statement
today. Analysts  estimated  profit of 505.4 million euros,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Legrand, which makes switches, plugs and lighting controls,
has said it may spend about 400 million euros on acquisitions
annually as part of a plan to grow by 10 percent a year from
2011 through 2015. The company is targeting an adjusted
operating margin before acquisitions of 19 percent to 20 percent
of sales in 2013, after 19.9 percent in 2012.  “We note the margin guidance excludes the impact of
acquisitions, which supports our view that the group should
embark on a large M&A operation this year,” Societe Generale
 analysts  said in a note today. They “see the prospects of
accelerated M&A as good news.”  Acquisition Contribution  Sales increased 5.1 percent last year, as the purchases of
four companies added 4.5 percentage points, Legrand said. Like-
for-like sales dropped 1.4 percent, and exchange rates had a
positive impact of 1.9 point.  “We’re still very much willing to reinforce the group’s
positions through external growth,” Schnepp said. “We’re
favoring companies with leadership positions.”  Legrand forecasts organic growth in sales this year to be
between a 2 percent drop and a 2 percent gain amid a “solid
pickup” in U.S. residential construction, European economic
woes, and uncertainty about when emerging markets growth will
accelerate further, Schnepp said. Legrand’s exposure to new home
sales accounts for “a bit more” than 20 percent of revenue,
the CEO said.  Adjusted  operating profit  as a proportion of sales,
including small and medium-size acquisitions, will average 20
percent from 2011 to 2015, the company reiterated today. Legrand
will pay a  dividend  of 1 euro a share this year, a gain of 7.5
percent.  The stock, which has advanced about 32 percent in the past
12 months, slipped 1.1 percent to 33.66 euros as of 4:32 p.m. in
