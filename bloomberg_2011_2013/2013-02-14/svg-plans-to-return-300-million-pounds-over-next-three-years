SVG Capital Plc , the biggest backer
of private equity firm Permira Advisers LLP, plans to return 300
million pounds ($465 million) to investors over three years
after the value of its holdings rose 16 percent in 2012.  Net asset value a share climbed to 391.2 pence at Dec. 31
from 337.1 pence in the year-earlier period, buoyed by the
firm’s holdings in fashion label  Hugo Boss  and casino operator
 Galaxy Entertainment , the London-based company said in a
statement today. The firm also committed 100 million pounds to
Cinven Ltd.’s latest private equity fund.  SVG Chief Executive Officer  Lynn Fordham  is seeking to
broaden the firm’s range of investments beyond Permira following
the financial crisis. The firm was forced to cut its pledges to
Permira by more than half in December 2008 and raise funds in a
share sale after the value of its holdings plunged.  “The work by Permira and the underlying management teams
has translated into a material increase in the value of our
assets,” Fordham said in today’s statement. “The company can
now start laying the foundations of its future returns beyond
the current portfolio with its first new commitment, which is to
the fifth Cinven fund.”  SVG will also sell a 50.1 percent stake in SVG Advisers,
its private equity fund management unit, to  Aberdeen Asset
Management Plc  for 17.5 million pounds, the company said. After
three years, Aberdeen has the option to buy the remaining stake
for between 20 million pounds and 35 million pounds.  The stock advanced 6.2 percent to 368.40 pence in London
trading, it steepest increase since June. The shares have jumped
almost 28 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
