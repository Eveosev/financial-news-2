Gold purchases by  India , the worldâ€™s
largest bullion buyer, surged 62 percent in the fourth quarter
on expectations of higher import duties and on demand for
weddings and festivals, according to the World Gold Council.  Imports climbed to 255 metric tons in the three months
through Dec. 31 from 157 tons a year earlier and 223 tons in the
previous quarter, the producer-funded group said in a report
today. Still, overseas purchases dropped 11 percent to 860 tons
last year from 969 tons in 2011, it said.  India tripled tax on gold imports in the past year, with
the levy rising to 6 percent on Jan. 21 as the government sought
to counter a current-account deficit. About 80 percent of the
shortfall is due to gold imports, the central bank says.  Gold use climbed to 261.9 tons in the three months ended
Dec. 31 from 185.5 tons a year earlier, the group said. Demand
for jewelry rose 35 percent to 153 tons, while investment in
coins and bars jumped 51 percent to 108.9 tons, it said.  Total supplies including recycled metal fell to 987 tons
last year from 1,039 tons in 2011, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
