U.S. auto sales per dealership
probably will climb to a record in 2013 as carmakers contain the
number of their outlets and boost vehicle deliveries for a
fourth straight year, according to an industry consulting firm.  Annual sales per dealer will increase to an estimated 839
vehicles from last year’s record of 812, consulting firm  Urban
Science  said today in an e-mailed statement. The Detroit-based
company used an industry estimate for this year of 15 million
car and light-truck sales.  Auto dealers are getting a boost from U.S. light-vehicle
sales that have climbed by at least 10 percent each of the last
three years, including a 13 percent increase last year that was
the biggest since 1984. Those sales are being achieved through a
retail network that shrank as part of the 2009 bankruptcies of
General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC’s predecessors.  “We have a good balance of sales and stores, allowing for
fewer incentives and increased dealership profitability,” John
Frith, vice president of retail channel solutions at Urban
Science, said in the statement.  Vehicles sold per dealership is a crucial figure to
dealers. In addition to revenue from selling new cars, the sales
of those vehicles lead to high-margin parts and service
business,  Kevin Tynan , a senior analyst for Bloomberg Industries
in Skillman, New Jersey, said last week.  The number of U.S. auto dealerships rose 0.5 percent to
17,851 last year, according to the statement. Urban Science
estimates that the “normal” level of sales per dealership will
settle at about 830.  To contact the reporters on this story:
