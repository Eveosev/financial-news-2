Treasury 30-year bonds rose for the
first time in four days as the highest yields at a U.S. auction
of the securities since May bolstered demand at today’s
government sale of $16 billion of the debt.  The long bonds drew a yield of 3.180 percent, compared with
an average forecast of 3.195 percent in a Bloomberg News survey
of eight of the Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers. The  bid-
to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of debt offered, was 2.74, versus an average of 2.62
at the past 10 offerings. Thirty-year yields touched 3.24
percent yesterday, almost the highest since April.  “This was a very good auction on a day when you had almost
continued rally, which emphasizes that there is still demand for
Treasuries at these levels,” said  Aaron Kohli , an interest-rate
strategist BNP Paribas SA in New York, which as a primary dealer
is obliged to bid in U.S. debt sales. “The strength of the
rally reemphasizes the lack of a trend change, and that we are
still in a bullish environment with Treasuries.”  The yield on current  30-year bonds  maturing in November
2042 dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.18
percent at 3:06 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader Prices. Yields on benchmark 10-year notes fell three
basis points to 2 percent.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 36.4 percent of the bonds sold today,
compared with 37.8 percent at the Jan. 10 sale and an average of
35.3 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14.5 percent at
today’s sale, compared with 16.7 percent at the previous sale,
and an average of 15.7 percent for the past 10.  Bond Loss  Thirty-year bonds have lost 5.2 percent this year, compared
with a 1.1 percent decline in the broader U.S. Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The U.S. sold $24 billion of  10-year debt  yesterday at a
yield of 2.046 percent. That was the highest since March and
compared with a forecast of 2.039 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight primary dealers. The U.S. auctioned $32 billion
of  three-year notes  on Feb. 12 at a yield of 0.411 percent,
higher than the 0.409 percent average forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The sales this week raise $8 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $64 billion,
according to the Treasury.  Inflation Outlook  U.S. 30-year bonds are among the securities most sensitive
to consumer prices because of their long maturity, as inflation
would erode the return on the bonds’ fixed payments for their
duration.  The Fed for the first time in December linked the outlook
for its main interest rate to unemployment and inflation
targets. The central bank said the rate would stay close to zero
“at least as long” as the jobless rate stays above 6.5 percent
and inflation projections are for no more than 2.5 percent.  The central bank’s preferred measure of inflation
expectations, the five-year, five-year forward  break-even rate ,
touched 2.93 percent on Feb. 11, close to the highest level
since August 2011. The gauge projects the expected pace of
consumer price increases from 2018 to 2023. The 2012 average is
2.6 percent.  The yield on the 30-year bond is forecast to rise to 3.4
percent by year-end, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Euro Region  Treasuries climbed earlier as a report showed the euro-area
economy shrank 0.6 percent in the final three months of 2012,
the worst performance in almost four years, amid slumping output
in its three leading economies.  The German economy, Europe’s largest, shrank 0.6 percent in
the fourth quarter, while French gross domestic product fell 0.3
percent. Both contractions exceeded the median forecasts of
economists. Italy’s economy shrank 0.9 percent, also more than
expected and a sixth straight contraction.  “The overnight news around the world was very weak,
underscoring weak global growth, which has led to safe haven
buying,” said  Jason Rogan , director of U.S. government trading
at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for
institutional investors.  U.S. government securities pared gains after a government
report showed claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 27,000
the most in a month, to 341,000 in the period ended Feb. 9,
compared with 366,000 a week earlier. The forecast was for a
drop to 360,000, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Ascending Channel  The 10-year note yield is exhibiting an ascending channel
pattern, where the yield shows higher highs and higher lows over
time, according to Royal Bank of Canada, citing technical
analysis. A close above 2.06 percent on the security will signal
a further rise in yield. The bearish momentum will stay in place
unless the notes’ yield falls below 1.92 percent, Royal Bank’s
analysis shows.  “The price action suggests that the market is still
looking to sell into rallies than buy on dips in prices,” said
 George Davis , chief technical analyst for fixed-income in
Toronto at Royal Bank’s RBC Capital Markets unit. “The rallies
are getting weaker and yields continue to creep higher,
suggesting we are still in a bearish environment and the path of
least resistance is higher yields.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
