Puma SE , Europe’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker, shifted away from its goal to reach 4
billion euros ($5.35 billion) of revenue by 2015 and made
improving profit a priority after earnings slid.  Reaching the target within the timescale is no longer a
priority, and it remains an “ambitious” aim, Chief Executive
Officer Franz Koch said today at a press conference at the
company’s Herzogenaurach, Germany headquarters.  Puma  will
continue to implement measures to improve its profitability this
year, including eliminating 450 jobs, while sales will be at a
similar level to 2012, he said.  “It is not our priority to push for sales growth at any
cost, but instead focus on improving desirability for the Puma
brand,” said the CEO, who is scheduled to leave at the end of
March after only two years in the job. “It will be difficult to
reach the 4 billion-euro goal by 2015.”  Puma, which set the revenue target in 2010, said today it
expects low-to-mid-single digit earnings growth in 2013. The
company is closing stores and cutting product ranges as owner
PPR SA seeks to boost the brand’s performance-wear credentials.
One-time expenses reached 177.5 million euros last year,
exceeding previous guidance of 100 million euros.  “Puma is in a deeper-than-expected restructuring
process,” said  Volker Bosse , an analyst at Baader Bank AG, who
recommends holding the shares. Koch’s comments on sales versus
profitability suggest “changing priorities going forward.”  ‘Very Volatile’  Puma rose 0.8 percent to 233.45 euros as of 2:07 p.m. in
Frankfurt trading, after a drop of as much as 2.8 percent
earlier in the day..  Earnings before interest and tax before special items fell
13 percent to 290.7 million euros last year. That beat the 285.6
million-euro average  estimate  of 13 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 8.7 percent to 3.27 billion euros.  “Top-line and results momentum continue to be very
volatile,” said  Michael Kuhn , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG,
who recommends holding the stock. The outlook for 2013 “is
cautious and somewhat disappointing.”  Puma, which is introducing new products for running,
training, fitness and golf, said it will cease making sailing
products from 2014. Performance-wear will account for about 60
percent of revenue by 2015, Koch said.  The company expects to operate 540 outlets at the end of
2013, down from 590 at the end of last year.  CEO Sought  A new CEO will be announced in the “coming weeks,” Koch
said at a presentation at the company’s headquarters. The
sporting-goods maker will be led by Chief Financial Officer
 Michael Laemmermann  and Chief Commercial Officer  Stefano Caroti 
from April 1 until a successor assumes the role, he said.  “It didn’t pan out unfortunately,” Koch said of his
departure. “In sporting terms, you would say that it was a
foul. But as a sportsman, I know that the best thing to do is
just to get back up on your feet again and get going again.”  Sales climbed 12 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted by
Asia and North America and the performance of Cobra Puma Golf,
the company said. Excluding currency swings, sales climbed 8.7
percent in the period.  Revenue advanced 16 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, 12
percent in the Americas and 7 percent in EMEA, Puma said. All
product segments grew in the quarter, led by a 15 percent gain
in apparel sales. Accessories sales advanced 12 percent, while
footwear gained 8.6 percent, Puma said.  The company also said it will propose a dividend of 0.5
euros a share for 2012 compared with 2 euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
