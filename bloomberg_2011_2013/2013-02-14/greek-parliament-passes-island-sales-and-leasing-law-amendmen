Greece’s Parliament passed a Defense
Ministry proposal requiring military approval for leasing of
state-owned islands and private island sales, adding a step to
the selling of assets.  A total of 166 lawmakers in the 300-member chamber backed
the amendment today, with 84 voting against and two saying they
were “present.” The law says state-owned islands can only be
leased through concessions, not sold. The approval of the
defense minister, citizen protection minister and the country’s
armed forces is required to lease state-owned islands, or sell
private islands, according to a faxed copy of the document
submitted in Parliament on Feb. 13.  Prime Minister  Antonis Samaras  suggested Aug. 23 that his
government could sell or lease some Greek islands to boost a
state-asset sales plan central to receiving international aid
funds. Greece has had two bailouts, the first in May 2010, from
the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, with a
total of 240 billion euros ($320 billion) in funds pledged.  Greece in November reduced its target for revenue from
selling state assets to 11.1 billion euros by 2016 from 19
billion euros by 2015. The Greek government said in April 2011
that it planned to raise 35 billion euros from state-owned
assets by 2015 as part of a 50 billion-euro program to reduce
public debt, the highest in the European Union as a percentage
of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporters on this story:
