The U.S. State Department barred
travel by officials to the 15th century ruins of Machu Picchu,
Peru’s top tourist destination, citing a heightened risk of
kidnapping.  A criminal organization may be planning to abduct U.S.
tourists visiting the mountain Inca sanctuary and the
surrounding Cuzco region, the U.S. embassy in Lima said in a
 statement  posted on its website yesterday.  “Personal travel by U.S. Embassy personnel to the Cuzco
region, including Machu Picchu, has been prohibited and official
travel is severely restricted as a result of this threat,” the
embassy said. “Possible targets and methods are not known and
the threat is credible at least through the end of February
2013.”  About 1.1 million tourists visited the citadel and Incan
ruins in the surrounding areas last year, including 762,000
foreigners, according to the Tourism Observatory of Peru.
Located 1,165 kilometers (725 miles) southeast of Lima, Machu
Picchu is the mainstay of the country’s tourist industry, which
generated $3.3 billion in revenue last year.  The embassy said it is confident of the Peruvian
government’s efforts to protect tourists.  Intelligence, Incident  The police presence in the area has been stepped up to
guarantee the security of visitors, Rose Likins, the U.S.
Ambassador to Peru, told Radio Programas del Peru. The embassy
is monitoring the situation in order to lift the security
warning as soon as possible, according to the Lima-based radio
station’s  website .  “Thousands of Americans come here every year and they have
a fantastic stay, and we hope that will continue,” she said.  Trade Minister  Jose Silva  told Radio Programas the Peruvian
government considers the intelligence on which the U.S. based
its warning not to be reliable.  Three American tourists were attacked by a group of about
30 people while driving through the Pallca area of Cuzco last
month, according to El Comercio. They were beaten and
interrogated for several hours before being released, the
Lima-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
