OTP Bank Nyrt. , Hungary’s largest
lender, slid the most in more than a week, leading the benchmark
stock index lower as the country’s recession deepened more than
forecast in the fourth quarter.  The shares dropped as much as 4.3 percent and traded 2.2
percent lower at 4,801 forint by the close in Budapest. The
volume was 191 percent of the three-month average. The BUX stock
 index , in which OTP has the highest weighting at 34 percent,
slid 1.9 percent.  Gross domestic product retreated 2.7 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, the most in three years, the
Budapest-based statistics office said today. The median estimate
of 18 economists in a Bloomberg survey was a 1.9 percent drop.
The slide compares with a 1.7 contraction in the Czech economy
in the same period, also announced today. Hungarian stocks
reacted to the “shockingly bad” GDP data, said Peter Varju, a
Budapest-based trader at Erste Group Bank AG.  “OTP is the most sensitive stock to changes in the
macroeconomic environment,” Varju said by phone. “Data like
this is best reflected in OTP’s shares.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
