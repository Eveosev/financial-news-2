Consumer confidence in the U.S.
climbed last week to the highest level in a month as improving
labor and real-estate markets eased the burden of a higher
payroll tax.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose to minus 35.9 in
the period ended Feb. 10 from minus 36.3 in the prior week. The
advance, within the survey’s margin of error of 3 percentage
points, was led by waning pessimism about the economy.  More job opportunities pushed the average length of
unemployment in January to a two-year low and the recovering
housing market has boosted property values, helping shore up
sentiment. At the same time, gasoline prices at a four-month
high and gridlock in Washington over the budget may prevent
confidence from staging a bigger recovery.  “Readings this low show consumers are still not fully
convinced that economic recovery is in the tea leaves,” said
 Richard Yamarone , a senior economist at Bloomberg LP in New
York. “Higher payroll taxes are weighing greatly on consumer
attitudes.”  Fewer Americans than projected filed  applications  for
unemployment benefits last week, indicating an improving outlook
for the labor market, another report showed today. Jobless
claims decreased by 27,000 to 341,000 in the week ended Feb. 9,
according to Labor Department figures.  Shares fell today on disappointing economic data from
overseas. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.3 percent to
1,516.51 at 9:40 a.m. in New York after reports showed economies
in Europe and Japan shrank more than forecast in the fourth
quarter.  Economy View  The Bloomberg gauge assessing Americans’ views on the
current  state of the economy  improved for a third straight week,
to minus 61.5 from minus 63.6. Nineteen percent had a positive
view, up from 18 percent the past three weeks.  The comfort index’s measure of  personal finances  held at
minus 1.6, the highest level this year. The  buying climate  index
fell to minus 44.6, the weakest reading in more than four
months, from minus 43.8 the prior week.  Higher fuel costs may be to blame. The price of a  gallon of
regular gasoline  has climbed about 40 cents since last year’s
low of $3.22 reached on Dec. 19, according to date from AAA, the
largest U.S. motoring organization.  What’s more, workers are smarting from the increase in the
payroll tax, which Congress allowed to return to its 2010 level
of 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent. An American who earns $50,000
is taking home about $83 less a month because of the levy.  More Jobs  Improving job prospects may help ease the burden. Employers
hired a net 157,000 workers last month following gains of
196,000 and 247,000 in December and November, Labor Department
figures show.  The average  duration  of unemployment fell in January to
35.3 weeks, the lowest since December 2010, from 38.1 weeks a
month earlier, according to the data.  Figures yesterday showed the brighter labor picture is
helping underpin spending. Retail sales rose 0.1 percent in
January after 0.5 percent increases in each of the prior two
months, according to the Commerce Department.  Lower borrowing costs may be bolstering purchases of big-
ticket items.  Auto sales  totaled 15.2 million at an annual rate
last month after 15.3 million in December, according to data
from Ward’s Automotive Group. The January pace compared with a
2012 average of 14.4 million.  Netgear Inc.  Chief Executive Officer  Patrick C. S. Lo  said
Feb. 12 that household spending is on the mend.  ‘Pretty Confident’  “We feel pretty confident that the consumers are back in
North America,” said Lo, whose San Jose, California-based
network equipment maker markets to small businesses and
households. “As we have seen in the U.S. in Q4 in particular,
the return of retail is pretty significant. We saw the
tremendous car sales numbers, as well as, you know, some of the
apparel chains.”  Confidence improved last week among income extremes. The
Bloomberg survey showed the comfort index for Americans making
more than $100,000 a year was positive for a second week,
climbing to 3.7 from 2.9. The gauge for households earning
$15,000 or less advanced to minus 49.8, the highest since 2007,
from minus 52.6.  Among those  making  $50,000 to $75,000, sentiment fell to
the lowest level since June.  A gauge of sentiment among young adults, those between 18
and 34, fell for a fifth straight month, to the lowest level
since September.  Survey Methodology  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, compiled by Langer
Research Associates in New York, conducts telephone surveys with
a random sample of 1,000 consumers 18 and older. Each week, 250
respondents are asked for their views on the economy, personal
finances and buying climate. The percentage of negative
responses is subtracted from the share of positive views and
divided by three. The most recent reading is based on the
average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative. The
margin of error for the headline reading is 3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
