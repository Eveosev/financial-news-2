SLC Agricola SA , the Brazilian
farming company that gets 45 percent of its revenue from selling
cotton to Asia, plans to expand its plantations by a quarter
through 2015 as demand increases for protein exports.  The company expects to operate 350,000 hectares (865,000
acres) during the 2014-2015 crop season, up from 280,000
hectares now, Chief Executive Officer  Aurelio Pavinato  said
today in a telephone interview. It currently plants mostly
cotton, soybean and corn.  A growing shift toward protein-based diets in Asia is
boosting demand for animal feed, Pavinato said. About three
quarters of its crops are exported and that ratio will rise
slightly through the decade.  “As Asian populations become richer, there’s more demand
for poultry and swine and the crops that feed them,” said
Pavinato, who was appointed to lead the company in December.  SLC Agricola plans to cultivate 700,000 hectares of fields
in Brazil by the end of the decade with sugar-cane and
sunflower, two crops it’s experimenting with now, making up
about 10 percent of the total. The company, based in Porto
Alegre, Brazil, will invest annually half its annual earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to expand
crops, he said. Last year Ebitda was about 300 million reais
($153 million).  All land purchases will be conducted by SLC Landco, a
venture 51 percent owned by SLC Agricola and 49 percent owned by
the Guernsey, Channel Islands-based investment fund Valiance
Asset Management Ltd., he said. The development of new crops
will use financing from local banks, including Brazil’s national
development lender Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e
Social.  SLC Agricola fell 0.1 percent to 21.17 reais at 4:10 p.m.
