Brown University is creating a
school of public health, bolstering its science offerings, which
include a medical school.  The public health school will open July 1, the Ivy League
university in Providence, Rhode Island, said today in a
 statement . National accreditation is expected to take about two
years.  Public health will be Brownâ€™s third professional school,
following the Alpert Medical School, formed in 1972, and the
School of Engineering in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
