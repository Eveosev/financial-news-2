New Zealand’s government has
agreements to buy 47 commercial properties in the heart of
quake-damaged Christchurch as the city center enters the rebuild
phase, Earthquake Recovery Minister  Gerry Brownlee  says.  Many central city office towers, hotels and iconic
structures such as the cathedral have been within a so-called
Red Zone since a devastating quake in February 2011. The cordon
has been reduced to 38 hectares from the initial 387 hectares as
buildings have been demolished or made safe.  “With over half of all staff working inside Christchurch’s
city cordon specifically concentrating on repair and
construction, the area can now be re-named the rebuild zone,”
Brownlee said in an e-mailed statement.  The government is seeking to buy 350 central city
properties to facilitate a new design for Christchurch’s center,
including a convention center, sports complex and a riverside
precinct. It is in negotiations on 215 properties at present,
Brownlee said.  “The enthusiasm of land owners to get the redevelopment
moving is a key part” of the city center taking shape, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
