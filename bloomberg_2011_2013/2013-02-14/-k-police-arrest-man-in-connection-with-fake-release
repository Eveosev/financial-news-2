Hong Kong Police arrested a 32-year-
old man in connection with a fraudulent press release
distributed over the Internet that purported to detail new
government measures to cool the property market.  The man was charged with access to a computer “with
criminal or dishonest intent” and released on police bail,
according to the statement, confirmed by the government’s press
room. Two sets of computers and a mobile phone were seized for
further examination in the investigation, the police said.  Police didn’t identify the man arrested in the city’s Happy
Valley district by officers of the Technology Crime Division of
Commercial Crime Bureau. He faces as long as five years in
prison if convicted, they said.  Hong Kong’s government said on Feb. 8, before the five-day
Chinese New Year break, that the statement was false, and had
been referred to police.  The Hang Seng Property Index fell 2.8 percent on Feb. 5,
the most since Oct. 29, after Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief
Executive  Norman Chan  said the previous day that more steps to
cool the housing market were possible as household debt rises
toward record levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
