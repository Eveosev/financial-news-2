The pound rose for the first time in
four days against the euro after a report showed the euro-area
recession deepened last quarter, spurring demand for
alternatives to European assets.  Sterling strengthened from near the weakest since October
2011 against the 17-nation currency as gross domestic product in
Germany and France also declined. U.K.  five-year government
bonds  rose after the Treasury sold 4 billion pounds ($6.2
billion) of the securities as yields at the highest in five
weeks lured investors. The difference in  yields  between five-and
10-year gilts widened to the most since December 2011.  “This morning the market was reminded that there are still
a lot of issues in the euro-region and we saw sterling up
against the euro,” said  Jane Foley , a senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International in London. “The euro-
region GDP numbers weren’t very good at all and the market has
sold the euro on the back of them.”  The pound gained 0.8 percent to 85.89 pence per euro at
4:21 p.m. London time after tumbling 2.3 percent during the
previous three days. The U.K. currency fell 0.1 percent to
$1.5521 after dropping to $1.5483, the weakest since July 26.  Gross domestic product in the euro area fell 0.6 percent
from the previous three months, the European Union’s statistics
office said. That’s the worst performance since the first
quarter of 2009 and exceeded the 0.4 percent median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Pound’s Decline  Sterling has still depreciated 4.6 percent this year, the
second-worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 0.5 percent and the euro has risen 1.6
percent.  The pound may decline to 88.90 pence per euro by Dec. 31 as
confidence in Europe improves and U.K. fundamentals remain weak,
Rabobank’s Foley said.  The U.K. currency slumped at least 0.8 percent against all
16 of its major counterparts yesterday as the Bank of England
released its quarterly Inflation Report and Governor  Mervyn King 
said Britain faced a muted recovery.  Investors should sell the pound against the dollar as the
U.K. currency may weaken to its January 2012 low of $1.5235,
according to Morgan Stanley.  “The pound has come under further pressure following the
BOE’s inflation report,” strategists including  Hans Redeker  in
London, wrote today in a research note. “Further easing
measures are possible,” they wrote.  Gilts Gain  Five-year gilts rallied after today’s auction as the euro-
area data fueled demand for safer investments.  “The euro-region GDP results were bad which has helped
fixed-income assets,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist
at Royal Bank of Canada in London. “The auction was pretty
solid. Overall it’s a good result.”  The Treasury sold the five-year securities at an average
yield of 1.277 percent, compared with 0.958 percent at the
previous auction on Jan. 3. Investors bid for 1.83 times the
number of securities allotted, versus an average of 1.63 times
at the previous five auctions.  The five-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 0.96 percent after rising to 1.04 percent,
the highest level since Jan. 7. The 1 percent gilt maturing in
September 2017 gained 0.17, or 1.70 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 100.18.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year securities
instead of five-year gilts widened two basis points to 123 basis
points after reaching 124, the most since Dec. 7, 2011.  U.K. government bonds handed investors a loss of 3 percent
this year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German bunds dropped 1.8 percent and Treasuries fell
1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
