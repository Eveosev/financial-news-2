Tessa Worley won the women’s giant
slalom at the world alpine skiing championships, giving France
its first gold medal in the event in 20 years.  Worley was fastest in both runs on the Planai course in
Schladming, Austria, with a total time of 2 minutes, 8.06
seconds. Defending champion  Tina Maze  of Slovenia was 1.12
seconds behind in second place, with Austrian Anna Fenninger
another 0.06 seconds back in third.  “It was a very tough course and I had to concentrate on
myself only, letting my skis go and not do too many mistakes,”
Worley, 23, said on the skiing World Cup website. “It feels
great.”  Carole Merle won France’s last women’s giant slalom world
title in Morioka, Japan, in 1993. It’s the second gold for the
French team at this year’s championships, after Marion Rolland
took the women’s downhill, and moves it to the top of the
national standings with four total medals.  Worley led Austria’s Kathrin Zettel by more than a half-
second after the first run, with Fenninger and Maze next. After
Maze posted the day’s then-best time of 1:03.19 on her second
pass, Worley topped that by 0.03 seconds to claim the gold.  Zettel finished in fourth place, followed by Sweden’s Frida
Hansdotter and 17-year-old Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. Olympic
champion Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany tied for 11th place,
almost three 3 1/2 seconds behind Worley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
