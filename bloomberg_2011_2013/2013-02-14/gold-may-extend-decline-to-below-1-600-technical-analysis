Gold, the worst-performing precious
metal this year, may drop below $1,600 an ounce in the next
couple of weeks after breaking a key support level, according to
technical analysis by Commerzbank AG.  Bullion for immediate delivery has fallen below the 2012-
2013 support line of $1,641.83 and will then test the January
low of $1,625.85,  Karen Jones  and  Axel Rudolph  wrote in a weekly
report dated Feb. 13.  “The $1,625.85 level remains key for the medium-term
trend,” they wrote. “Failure here should provoke a sell-off to
below $1,600 level before the precious metal levels out and
starts rising again.”  On a weekly basis, gold has fallen through the 2008-2013
uptrend line at $1,651.66 and may head down toward the $1,600
level, they said.  Gold has slipped 2.4 percent this year, underperforming an
11 percent gain in platinum, an 8.3 percent climb in palladium
and a 0.2 percent rise in silver. Gold traded at $1,634.60 an
ounce at 8:13 a.m. in Seoul.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A support level indicates a price
at which buy orders may accumulate when a security is falling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
