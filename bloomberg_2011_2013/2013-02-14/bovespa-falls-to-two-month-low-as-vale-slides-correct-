The Bovespa index fell to a two-
month low as iron-ore mining company  Vale SA  slumped on concern
that the contraction in the euro region and Japan will sap
demand for Brazil’s exports.  Lender  Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul SA  slid to the
lowest in a month after reporting profit that missed estimates.
 Vale  contributed the most to the equity gauge’s decline.  LLX
Logistica SA  rebounded from the lowest level since November,
jumping the most on the benchmark.  The Bovespa slid 0.6 percent to 58,077.31 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, its lowest level since Dec. 6. The real
gained 0.4 percent to 1.9582 per dollar. The MSCI Brazil
Materials index declined to a two-week low after the European
Union said gross domestic product fell 0.6 percent in the fourth
quarter from the previous three months, the most in almost four
years.  “Commodities exporters are the most liquid stocks on the
Bovespa, so they suffer more in times when investors are more
sensitive, like today, because of the disappointing GDP
numbers,”  Alvaro Bandeira , a partner at Orama Asset Management,
said by phone from Rio de Janeiro. Raw-materials producers
account for 43 percent of the Bovespa’s weighting.  Japan’s gross domestic product contracted an annualized 0.4
percent, following a revised 3.8 percent drop in the previous
quarter, the Cabinet Office said in Tokyo today. The median
forecast of 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for 0.4
percent growth.  Vale fell 1.8 percent to 36.75 reais. Pulp producer  Suzano
Papel e Celulose SA  slid 3.2 percent to 6.40 reais.  Banrisul Decline  Banrisul, as Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul is known,
declined 2.8 percent to 16.25 reais, the lowest price since Jan.
9. LLX gained 6.8 percent to 2.04 reais, snapping a six-day
losing streak.  The Bovespa climbed 7.4 percent in 2012 in its biggest
yearly rally since 2009 as stimulus from central banks around
the world eased economic concern and borrowing costs at a record
low in Brazil boosted equity demand.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 10.9 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.4 for MSCI’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 5.3 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
today, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with a daily average of 7.5 billion reais this year, according
to data compiled by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
