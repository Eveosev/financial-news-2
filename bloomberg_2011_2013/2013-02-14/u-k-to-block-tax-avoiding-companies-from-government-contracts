The U.K. government will block
companies with a history of breaking tax rules from government
contracts, Chief Secretary to the Treasury  Danny Alexander  said.  Under proposals published in London today, companies
bidding for contracts starting on April 1 will have to make a
declaration about their tax compliance and departments will for
the first time have the power to refuse contracts on the grounds
a company has broken anti-avoidance rules.  Lawmakers have questioned companies including Starbucks
Corp., Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. about why they pay
relatively low tax on their U.K. income. The government, which
is lowering the level of corporation tax, is looking for ways to
encourage payment.  “The government is clear that aggressive tax avoidance is
totally unacceptable,” Alexander said in an e-mailed statement.
“These new rules are another significant tool as they will
enable government departments to say no to firms bidding for
government contracts where they have been involved in failed tax
avoidance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
