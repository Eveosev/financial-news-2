Romania’s economy unexpectedly
avoided entering a recession in the fourth quarter of last year
as gross domestic product grew.  GDP  rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent from the
previous three months after a 0.4 percent decline in the third
quarter, the  National Statistics Institute  in Bucharest said
today in an e-mailed flash estimate. GDP advanced 0.3 percent
from the fourth quarter of 2011. The median estimate of six
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg was for a 0.1 percent quarterly
contraction. Fourteen economists forecast 0.2 percent growth
from a year earlier in a separate survey.  Romania’s economy, which went through its worst recession
on record from 2008 until 2010, expanded 0.2 percent last year
compared with growth of 2.2 percent in 2011, because of a poor
harvest and slowing export growth amid Europe’s debt crisis.  “Romania’s GDP growth may stay subdued in the first half
of 2013, but is expected to accelerate in the second half of the
year on the back of strengthening domestic demand,”  Szilvia Laszlo , a Budapest-based economist at DZ Bank AG, wrote in a
note before the data release. “The average annual growth of GDP
may accelerate to around 1.4 percent this year, and is likely to
speed up to around 2.8 percent in 2014.”  The statistics institute will release a breakdown for four-
quarter GDP on March 6, according to a calendar on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
