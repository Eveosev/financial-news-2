DirecTV , the largest U.S. satellite-
TV provider, fell the most in more than four months after the
company said it’s taking a $160 million charge this quarter to
account for Venezuela’s decision to devalue its currency.  The South American country announced it was devaluing the
bolivar 32 percent on Feb. 8. While DirecTV Chief Executive
Officer  Mike White  said he was optimistic about Venezuela as a
long-term market, the move means the company won’t see growth in
its Latin American operating profit this year, excluding
depreciation and amortization.  Vijay Jayant , an analyst at ISI
Group in New York, had estimated a 6 percent gain.  DirecTV Chief Financial Officer  Pat Doyle  also said the
company’s new $4 billion share repurchase program may extend
into next year. The hint that DirecTV wouldn’t necessarily make
all of the buybacks in 2013 may have disappointed investors,
 Shing Yin , an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC in New York,
said in an interview.  “The Latin American guidance was disappointing, and the
lack of clarity on the buyback just added to that,” Yin said.  DirecTV fell 2.8 percent to $50.21, its largest one-day
decline since October, after rising as much as 3.4 percent
earlier in the day. Investors were “excited” about the buyback
until hearing during the call that DirecTV may not use it all
this year, Yin said.  Fourth-quarter Earnings  White reiterated that DirecTV is still evaluating acquiring
Vivendi SA’s GVT Internet and phone unit in Brazil. The
company’s buyback plans could change if DirecTV buys GVT, Doyle
said. DirecTV is competing against a private-equity group bid
for GVT, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  DirecTV reported a 31 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit
after adding a record number of Latin American customers and
selling an 18 percent stake in the Game Show Network.  Net income rose to $942 million, or $1.55 a share, from
$718 million, or $1.02, a year earlier, the El Segundo,
California-based company said in a statement. The Game Show
Network transaction helped fuel profit with a $111 million
pretax gain. Sales rose 7.9 percent to $8.05 billion, topping
the average  estimate  of $8.03 billion compiled by Bloomberg.  DirecTV  added 658,000 customers in Latin America, more than
the 588,000 estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, for a
total of 10.3 million. DirecTV is increasing its subscriber base
in Latin America by going after middle-class customers, said
 Paul Sweeney , an analyst at Bloomberg Industries.  ‘Managing the Process’  “The company has to balance stronger subscriber growth
with lower revenue per user and higher churn, and the fourth-
quarter results suggest they are managing the process quite
well,” Sweeney said.  Latin American churn -- the monthly turnover among
subscribers -- rose to 1.75 percent from 1.65 percent. Average
revenue per user declined 7.6 percent to $55.84, though that was
higher than the average analyst estimate of $54.83.  The company added 103,000 U.S. subscribers last quarter,
ending with 20.1 million. White announced U.S. net additions
would be around 100,000 last month.  Average revenue per user in the U.S. rose 3.7 percent to
$105.15, and churn dropped to 1.43 percent from 1.52 percent a
year earlier.  DirecTV estimated that 2013 U.S. capital expenditure
spending will be about $2 billion, a “peak year,” Doyle said.
The increased spending will go toward improving DirecTV’s
Internet streaming options, improving the user experience and
upgrading the company’s campus in El Segundo, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
