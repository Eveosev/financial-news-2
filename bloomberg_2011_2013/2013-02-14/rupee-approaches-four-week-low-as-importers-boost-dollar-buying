India’s rupee approached a four-week
low on speculation importers stepped up purchases of dollars
after the Asian currency reached the strongest level since
October last week.  Wholesale prices  rose 6.62 percent last month from a year
earlier, official data showed today, compared with 7.18 percent
in December and 6.98 percent predicted in a Bloomberg survey.
India will auction 667 billion rupees ($12.4 billion) of debt-
purchase permits to overseas investors on Feb. 20, according to
a statement on the capital markets regulator’s website. The
rupee’s losses will be limited by inflows into local-currency
bonds, according to Andhra Bank.  “We are seeing oil importers buying dollars, while this
week’s data has already been factored into prices,” said  Vikas Babu , a Mumbai-based trader at the state-run lender. “Foreign
investors will be readying flows for the debt-quota auctions
next week.”  The rupee declined 0.2 percent to 53.9300 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
54.1075 on Feb. 12, the lowest level since Jan. 18. The currency
reached 52.8900 on Feb. 6, the strongest level since Oct. 17.

exchange rate used to price options, fell 26 basis points, or
0.26 percentage point, to 9.09 percent.  Industrial production fell 0.6 percent in December after a
revised 0.8 percent drop the previous month, official data
showed Feb. 11. India’s exports climbed 0.8 percent in January
