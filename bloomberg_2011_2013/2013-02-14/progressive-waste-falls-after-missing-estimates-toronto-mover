Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd. , a
trash hauler, fell the most in almost a year after reporting
profit and 2013 outlook that missed analysts’ estimates.  Progressive Waste  fell  4.8 percent to C$21.33 at 11:17 a.m.
in Toronto after falling as much as 5.4 percent earlier, the
biggest intra-day decline since Feb. 29. The company’s shares
rose 2.1 percent in the 12 months through yesterday.  The Vaughan, Ontario-based company said today it had profit
of $11.75 million, or 10 cents a share, in the fourth quarter,
compared with a net loss of $296.2 million, or a loss of $2.48,
in the year-earlier period.  Progressive Waste said it earned 24 cents a share excluding
items,  missing  the 27 cents a share average estiamte of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The company also said it expects adjusted profit will be
$1.02 to $1.06 a share for 2013, below the $1.15 a share average
 estimate  for the year by 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Revenue will rise to $2 billion to $2.02 billion, an increase of
5.4 percent to 6.5 percent, for 2013, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
