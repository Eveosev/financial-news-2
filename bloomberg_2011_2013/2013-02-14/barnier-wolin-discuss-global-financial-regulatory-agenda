The U.S. Acting Treasury Secretary
 Neal Wolin  and European Union financial services chief  Michel Barnier  discussed global financial regulatory issues including
the risks of regulatory arbitrage, the Treasury Department said.  Wolin underscored the importance of “aligning regulations
to mitigate the risks of regulatory arbitrage” and the need for
“strong trans-Atlantic cooperation on financial regulation” to
eliminate gaps and inconsistencies, according to the e-mailed
