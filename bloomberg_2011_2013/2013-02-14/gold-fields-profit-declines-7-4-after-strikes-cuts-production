Gold Fields Ltd. , a producer of the
metal that spun off some of its South African operations this
week, said profit fell 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter,
missing expectations, because of lost production from illegal
strikes.  Adjusted net income in the three months through December
was 1.37 billion rand ($155 million), or 1.87 rand a share,
compared with 1.48 billion rand, or 2.02 rand a share, a quarter
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. The  median estimate  by six analysts in a Bloomberg survey
was for a profit of 2.03 rand a share. Output declined to
754,000 ounces from 811,000 ounces in the September quarter.  Gold Fields on Feb. 11 spun off its deeper, more labor-
intensive South African mines into  Sibanye Gold Ltd. , partly
reacting to strikes that began in the country’s platinum
industry before spreading to other operations. All three of Gold
Fields’ operating mines in South Africa returned to production
in November after two months of wildcat stoppages that involved
as many as 23,540 of Gold Fields’s 35,700 workers.  “While the international operations had an outstanding
quarter, KDC and Beatrix in South Africa were impacted by the
industry-wide illegal strikes in the South African mining
industry,” Chief Executive Officer  Nick Holland  said in a
statement.  Strikes at the KDC and Beatrix mines resulted in 110,000
ounces of lost production, the company said.  The average price for gold in the quarter through December
was $1,718 an ounce compared with $1,653 in the previous three
months.  Profit for the year through December declined to 6.83
billion rand from 7.24 billion rand a year earlier. Gold
analysts in South Africa compare quarters sequentially.  To contact the reporter on this story:
