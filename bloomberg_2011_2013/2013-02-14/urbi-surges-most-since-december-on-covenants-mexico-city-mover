Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB , the
nation’s third-largest publicly-traded homebuilder, surged the
most in two months after saying it renegotiated bank debt
covenants in danger of being broken.  The shares climbed 3.1 percent to 5.67 pesos at 2:43 p.m.
in Mexico City, set for the biggest one-day gain since Dec. 14.
The benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican stocks fell 0.5 percent.  Urbi has renegotiated or gotten waivers on bank debt
covenants it was close to violating,  Antonio Jorge , an investor
relations official for the homebuilder, said in a telephone
interview yesterday from Mexico City. Mexicali, Mexico-based
Urbi and its peers have struggled to end a cash hemorrhage as
the government promotes apartment construction requiring more
initial investment than single-unit buildings, a policy shift
that has forced the industry to adapt.  “All the flexibility that they can get is positive,”
 Jorge Lagunas , who oversees $200 million in stocks at Grupo
Financiero Interacciones SA, said in a telephone interview today
from Mexico City.  Urbi shares  trade  at 0.3 times book value, compared with
3.1 times for the IPC index.  About 1 billion pesos ($78.8 million) of Urbi’s bank loans
had a covenant stipulating that gross debt in the third quarter
couldn’t exceed 4.25 times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, according to Jorge. The amount
represents about 25 percent of the homebuilder’s bank debt and
5.7 percent of total obligations, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
