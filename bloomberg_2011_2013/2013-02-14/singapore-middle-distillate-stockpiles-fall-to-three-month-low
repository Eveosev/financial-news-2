Singaporeâ€™s stockpiles of middle
distillates fell to the lowest level in almost three months,
according to data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  middle distillates , a category that
includes gasoil and kerosene, dropped 11 percent to 9.47 million
barrels, in the week ended yesterday,  International Enterprise
Singapore , a unit of the ministry, said today in an e-mailed
statement. Supplies are at the lowest since Nov. 21.  Stockpiles of  residues  such as fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy
residue fell 3 percent to 18.8 million barrels, a three-week
low. This category excludes bitumen.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline declined 1.5 percent to 9.54 million barrels, the
lowest this year.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil companies and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
