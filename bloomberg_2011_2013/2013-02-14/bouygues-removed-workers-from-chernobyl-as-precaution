Bouygues Construction, a French
affiliate of group  Bouygues  SA formed to build a protective
shield over the Chernobyl nuclear plant, removed its workers
from the site as a precaution after part of a structure
collapsed.  Bouygues is awaiting “guarantees” from the Chernobyl
plant that the collapse of side panels 150 meters (about 500
feet) from the construction site on Feb. 12 won’t affect the
stability of the protecting roof, spokeswoman Fabienne Bouloc
said in e-mailed comments. Radiation levels at the site are
within the normal range, the company said in a statement.  Ukraine raised about 550 million euros ($734 million) at a
donor conference in April 2010 to seal the site of the world’s
worst nuclear disaster. Countries including the U.K., the U.S.,
France, Russia and Germany made donations. The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development contributed 190 million euros.  The Chernobyl plant needs to verify that the roof is under
no danger of falling, and its operator is also expected to clean
off the snow, Bouloc said. Bouygues expects the report will be
finished in the next 14 days, she said.  The 600 square meters (6,500 square feet) of side panels
are not essential elements to the shelter facility, the
Chernobyl power plant said on its website on Feb. 12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
