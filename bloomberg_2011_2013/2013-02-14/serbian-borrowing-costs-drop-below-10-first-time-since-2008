Serbia’s borrowing costs dropped
below 10 percent for the first time since 2008 as the government
raised dinars through three-month Treasury bills.  The government paid an average of 9.80 percent to borrow 3
billion dinars ($36 million) at an auction today, according to
the Serbian Debt Management Agency’s e-mailed statement.
Investors’ bids amounted to 6.27 billion dinars.  Serbia last raised three-month debt at 9.9 percent in
December 2008, following two years of cheap borrowing, which
bottomed out at 4.20 percent in May 2008, according to central
bank data.  The Balkan nation is paying nearly 10 times more than
neighboring Croatia, which paid 1 percent for three-month kuna
funds. Serbia’s northern neighbor Hungary paid 5.28 percent on
three-month T-bills on Feb. 12, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
