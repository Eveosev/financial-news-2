The U.S. Treasury Department said it
signed a bilateral agreement with Switzerland to facilitate the
implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.  The act, enacted by Congress in 2010 and often referred to
by the acronym FATCA, targets non-compliance by U.S. taxpayers
using foreign accounts, the Treasury said today in a statement
in Washington.  “Today’s announcement marks a significant step forward in
our efforts to work collaboratively to combat offshore tax
evasion,” said Acting Secretary of the Treasury  Neal S. Wolin  in
a statement. “We are pleased that Switzerland has signed a
bilateral agreement with us, and we look forward to quickly
concluding agreements based on this model with other
jurisdictions.”  Switzerland is one of eight countries that have signed or
initialed an intergovernmental agreement, which helps to
facilitate the effective and efficient implementation of FATCA,
the Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
