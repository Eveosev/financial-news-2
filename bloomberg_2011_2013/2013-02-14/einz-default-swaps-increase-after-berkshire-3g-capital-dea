The cost of protecting  H.J. Heinz
Co.’s  debt from losses soared after  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. and  Jorge Paulo Lemann ’s 3G Capital agreed to buy
the ketchup maker for about $23 billion.  Five-year credit-default swaps on the Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania-based company’s debt climbed 106.5 basis points to
148 basis points as of 9:44 a.m. in New York, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The buyers will pay $72.50 a share, according to a
statement today. Berkshire will spend about $12 billion to $13
billion on the deal for the maker of Ore-Ida potato snacks,
Buffett told CNBC. The deal will also be financed with cash from
3G affiliates, plus the rollover of existing borrowings, and is
valued at about $28 billion including debt, according to the
statement.  Credit-default swaps typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
