Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at
Toyota Asset Management Co., which oversees about 1.79 trillion
yen ($19 billion), comments on Bank of Japan policy following
today’s decision to maintain asset purchases.  “It was as expected. I think BOJ’s easing stance will be
strengthened under new executives, but the degree of it will
depend on who will be chosen. The market may sway a lot
depending on the pick.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
