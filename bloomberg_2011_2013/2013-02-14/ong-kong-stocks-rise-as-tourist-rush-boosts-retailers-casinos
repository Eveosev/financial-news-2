Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index headed for its biggest gain in two weeks, as the
city’s retailers and Macau casino operators climbed on increased
tourist arrivals during a three-day holiday. Chinese developers
rebounded after slumping last week.  Chow Sang Sang Holdings International Ltd., a jewelry
retailer, rose 2.6 percent after a report tourism during the
Lunar New Year holiday jumped 33 percent from a year earlier.
 Wynn Macau Ltd. , the Hong Kong-listed casino unit of Wynn
Resorts Ltd., gained 2.2 percent as Chinese arrivals in Macau
also rose. China Resources Land Ltd., a state-owned developer,
advanced 3.8 percent after last week slumping 7.6 percent on
concern more property curbs will be introduced.  The  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.9 percent to 23,427.41 as of
10:48 a.m. in Hong Kong, with about five stocks advancing for
every four that fell. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies climbed 1.4 percent to 11,816.20. China’s
markets will remain closed for the rest of the week.  “If the A-shares open higher after the holiday next Monday,
the Hong Kong stock market may have another upside next week,”
said  Patrick Yiu , associate director at Cash Asset Management
Ltd. in Hong Kong. Mainland developers are being bought after
they were oversold last week, and as investors anticipate
property transaction volumes to rise, Yiu said.  The Hang Seng Index surged 22 percent from the end of
August through January, as China’s economic reports signaled a
recovery and as central banks added stimulus to boost growth.
The gauge traded at 11.3 times average  estimated earnings  on Feb.
8, compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
12.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The gauge gained 0.1 percent yesterday to the
highest level since October 2007 as investors weighed economic
reports and President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index climbed 0.7 percent to
23,414. The  HSI Volatility Index  rose 1.1 percent to 14.40,
indicating traders expect a swing of 4.1 percent for the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
