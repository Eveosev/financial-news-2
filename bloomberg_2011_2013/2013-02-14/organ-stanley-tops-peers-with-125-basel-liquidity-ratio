Morgan Stanley , which borrowed the
most from the Federal Reserve in the 2008 financial crisis, now
has one of the highest liquidity-reserve levels among the
biggest banks to defend against another funding freeze.  Morgan Stanley estimates its liquidity coverage ratio is
more than 125 percent, based on the New York-based company’s
interpretation of rules set to take effect in 2015, Treasurer
 David Russo  said today on a conference call with fixed-income
investors. That tops Citigroup Inc.’s 118 percent, UBS AG’s 113
percent and Deutsche Bank AG’s roughly 95 percent.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s liquidity
coverage ratio, scheduled to be phased in starting in two years,
requires banks to hold enough “high-quality liquid assets” --
predominantly cash and government debt -- to survive 30 days of
stress. The Basel group last month expanded the types of assets
that can be counted as liquid.  Morgan Stanley borrowed $107.3 billion, the most of any
bank, from the Federal Reserve in September 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News in 2011. Morgan Stanley’s
borrowing peaked after hedge funds pulled $128.1 billion from
the firm in two weeks, documents released by the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission show.  Chief Financial Officer  Ruth Porat , who took her role at
the start of 2010, has attempted to improve the firm’s ability
to handle a crisis by relying on longer-term secured loans,
holding more liquid assets and reducing its reliance on prime-
brokerage clients for funding. Porat is being considered for the
role of deputy Treasury secretary, people familiar with the
matter said last month.  Barclays Plc said this week that its LCR estimate was 126
percent, up from 103 percent before the Basel group’s revised
rules. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it would be in compliance with
the rule, which will eventually require firms to have a ratio of
at least 100 percent, by the end of 2013. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said it is well-positioned for the rule, without providing
figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
