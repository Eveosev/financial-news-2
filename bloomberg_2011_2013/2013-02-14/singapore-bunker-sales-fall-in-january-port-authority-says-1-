Singaporeâ€™s sales of ship fuel, or
bunker, fell to 3.38 million metric tons in January from 3.63
million tons in December, according to data published on the
website of the Maritime and Port Authority today.  The port authority later removed the data from its website.
An official at the agency said some sales information had not
been included and the correct data may be published next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
