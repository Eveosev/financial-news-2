SACI Falabella , Chile’s largest
publicly traded company, fell for a third day on speculation
that profit from retail outlets in Argentina will fall if the
country devalues its currency.  Falabella, which operates department stores, shopping
malls, supermarkets and home improvement stores, retreated 1.8
percent to 5,460 pesos at 5:05 p.m. in Santiago. It was the
biggest loser on the benchmark Chilean Ipsa index. The stock,
which reached a record high 5,710 pesos on Feb. 11, has since
tumbled 4.4 percent.  “At Falabella’s current level, it hasn’t fully priced in
the risk from Argentina,”  German Guerrero , a partner at
Santiago-based broker and asset manager MBI Servicios
Financieros, said in a telephone interview.  Trading in foreign-exchange markets shows that some
speculators are betting Argentina will follow Venezuela and
devalue its currency. Santiago-based Falabella obtained 7.9
percent of its revenue from Argentina in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
