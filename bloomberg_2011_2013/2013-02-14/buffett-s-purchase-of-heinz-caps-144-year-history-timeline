Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc.  and Jorge Paulo Lemann’s 3G Capital are buying HJ Heinz Co.
for about $23 billion, gaining a ketchup maker that began in the
1860s.  The deal ends the independence of Heinz, which sells 650
million bottles of ketchup annually, according to the company’s
 website . The following is a timeline of Heinz’s history from a
small condiment maker to a multidivisional packaged food
company.  1869: Henry J. Heinz and L. Clarence Noble form company in
Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, to sell horseradish.  1875: Heinz, Noble & Co. negotiate pre-harvest prices for
pickles with farmers. The company is then forced to file for
bankruptcy after unexpectedly large harvests produce excessive
quantities of cucumber pickles, straining resources.  1876: The Heinz family regroups and forms F & J Heinz and Co.
and introduces its famous Tomato Ketchup. Henry Heinz later
chooses the slogan “57 varieties” after seeing an
advertisement for a shoe store boasting “21 styles.”  1900: The company erects Manhattan’s first electric sign on
Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. It was six stories high and
included a pickle and the “57 Variety” slogan.  1946: Heinz acquires StarKist, with its popular marketing
mascot, Charlie the Tuna. That same year, Heinz shares go public
under Jack Heinz, the grandson of Henry Heinz, and the company
expands into Holland, Japan, Venezuela and Italy.  1965: Heinz acquires Ore-Ida, the retail frozen potato brand.  1978: Heinz buys Weight Watchers International.  1979: Anthony O’Reilly is named CEO and leads a global expansion
into Africa, China and Eastern Europe.  1996: Bill Johnson becomes president and chief operating officer
at a time when retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and growth
of private label brands put price pressure on Heinz’s products.
Two years later he is named Heinz’s sixth chief executive
officer.  August 2006: Investor Nelson Peltz initiates a proxy battle with
the company over the makeup of the board. Following the vote,
Peltz and one of his nominees join the board.  September 2005: Venezuelan authorities seize a Heinz plant in
that country as the facility stood idle due to a dispute between
the company and local tomato growers.  February 2010: Heinz reduces the sodium content in its ketchup
to “support consumers’ desire from lower-sodium products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
