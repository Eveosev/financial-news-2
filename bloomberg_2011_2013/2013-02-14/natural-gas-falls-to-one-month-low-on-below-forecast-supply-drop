Natural gas futures tumbled to a
one-month low in New York after a government report showed that
U.S. stockpiles fell by less than forecast last week.  Gas dropped as much as 4.1 percent, the most since Jan. 28,
after the Energy Information Administration said inventories
slid 157 billion cubic feet in the week ended Feb. 8 to 2.527
trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
showed an expected withdrawal of 166 billion.  “The data was obviously a bearish surprise,” said  Brad Florer , a trader at Kottke Associates LLC in Louisville,
Kentucky. “Reports like this keep storage at levels that are
likely to keep downward pressure on the market.”  Natural gas for March delivery fell 13.3 cents, or 4
percent, to $3.173 per million British thermal units at 11:03
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas slipped to $3.172
per million Btu, the lowest intraday price since Jan. 10. The
futures traded at $3.276 before the report was released at 10:30
a.m. Trading volume was 78 percent above the 100-day average for
the time of day.  March $3 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They rose 1 cent to 1.4 cents per million
Btu on volume of 565 contracts as of 11:06 a.m. Puts accounted
for 58 percent of options volume.  The stockpile decrease was bigger than the five-year
average decline for the week of 154 billion cubic feet,
department data show. A  surplus  to the five-year average widened
to 16 percent from 15 percent the previous week, according to
the EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy Department. Supplies
were 9.7 percent below year-earlier inventories, compared with
7.8 percent last week.  Temperature Outlook  WSI Corp. in Andover, Massachusetts, predicted mostly
normal weather in the eastern half of the U.S. from Feb. 24
through Feb. 28.  The low in Cleveland on Feb. 26 may be 29 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius), 1 higher than average, according
to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania. The low in
Memphis, Tennessee, on Feb. 26 may be 44 degrees, 5 above
normal.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
data from the Energy Information Administration show. The agency
is part of the Energy Department.  Last year was the warmest in records going back to 1895 for
the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the second-worst for weather
extremes including drought, hurricanes and wildfires, according
to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  Winter Weather  “Some early cold in November notwithstanding, winter
weather just hasn’t played out in the bulls’ favor,”  Katherine Spector , a commodities strategist at CIBC World Markets in New
York, said in a note to clients dated yesterday. “It’s late in
the game for a truly bullish end-season storage scenario to
materialize.”  Marketed gas production will average a record 70.02 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up 1.1 percent from 2012, the Energy
Information Administration said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook , released yesterday in Washington.  Gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana,
will average $3.53 per million Btu in 2013, up from $2.75 per
million Btu last year, the EIA said.  “Production in the Marcellus Shale areas of Pennsylvania
and West Virginia is expected to continue rising as recently
drilled wells become operational,” the EIA said in the report.  March Stockpiles  Gas stockpiles may total 2.0 trillion cubic feet at the end
of March, down from 2.477 trillion at the same time last year,
according to the report.  Output rose to an all-time high of 28.5 trillion cubic feet
in 2011, led by record output from shale deposits, the EIA said
in a separate report Jan. 7. Shale accounted for 30 percent of
total production in 2011, up from 22 percent the previous year.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 84 percent of its
energy needs in the first 10 months of last year, government
data show. If the trend lasted through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporters on this story:
