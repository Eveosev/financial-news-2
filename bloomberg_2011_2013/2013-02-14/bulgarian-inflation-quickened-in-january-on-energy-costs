Bulgarian inflation accelerated in
January as spending on heating, electricity and transport
increased on cold weather.  Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 4.2 percent increase in December, the National
Statistics Institute in Sofia said in a statement today. The
median estimate of four economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 4.4
percent. The inflation rate was unchanged at 0.4 percent from
the previous month.  Bulgaria, the European Unionâ€™s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, withstood the global recession
without an international bailout. Inflation, calculated using
European Union methodology, will accelerate 3.4 percent in 2013,
the government forecast on Oct. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
