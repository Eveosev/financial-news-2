Electricite de France SA, Europe’s
biggest power generator, may sell minority holdings in companies
like Swiss utility Alpiq Holding AG.  Alpiq is “probably not” a long-term investment, Chief
Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  said today in Paris following a
presentation of 2012 earnings.  EDF sold its stake in Germany’s EnBW Energie Baden-
Wuerttemberg AG and took control of Edison SpA in Italy as part
of a reorganization of holdings in Europe. The French utility
reported earnings today that included an impairment of 248
million euros for Alpiq, in which it has held a 25 percent stake
since 2009.  “Everything is open. We won’t stay as we are in minority
positions,” Proglio said. “We want to be in control of our own
destiny.”  Alpiq is in the midst of a restructuring after starting a
cost-cutting initiative in November 2011. It has sold 500
million francs ($543 million) of assets, streamlined its
organization to make 100 million francs in annual savings, and
decided to pull out of the retail business in Spain and Italy
last year.  EDF doesn’t feel “under pressure” to sell assets, Proglio
said. The French utility reported pro forma debt at the end of
last year of 39.2 billion euros compared with 33.3 billion euros
the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
