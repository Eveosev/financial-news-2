Platinum dropped the most in more
than two weeks after a report showed Europe’s recession deepened
more than economists forecast, spurring concern that metal
demand will ebb. Gold fell to the lowest in more than a month.  Gross domestic product in the euro area fell 0.6 percent in
the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the worst
performance since the first quarter of 2009. Platinum has
climbed 11 percent this year on lower output in South Africa,
the world’s biggest producer.  “Economic worries about Europe are pushing platinum
down,”  Phil Streible , a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien
& Associates, said in a telephone interview. “The overall
trend, however, is bullish as supply concerns remain.”  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery fell 1.1 percent to settle at $1,710.90 an ounce
at 1:15 p.m. The price, which gained 2 percent in the previous
two days, reached a 16-month high of $1,744.50 on Feb. 6.  Europe is the biggest market for platinum used in
pollution-control devices in vehicles, according to London-based
Johnson Matthey.  Gold futures for April delivery retreated 0.6 percent to
$1,635.50 an ounce on the Comex in New York, extending this
year’s loss to 2.4 percent. Earlier, the precious metal touched
$1,632.80, the lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 4.  Prices, which are trading below the 200-day moving average,
may fall to $1,600, according to  Sterling Smith , a Chicago-based
commodity futures specialist at Citigroup Inc.  “The trend is very weak, and we could breach the $1,600
level,” Smith said in a telephone interview today. “I don’t
see much reversal in the course.”  In the spot market, an ounce of platinum bought as many as
1.054 ounces of gold, the most since August 2011.  Silver futures for March delivery slid 1.7 percent to
$30.353 an ounce in New York, after dropping to $30.21 the
lowest since Jan. 11.  Palladium futures for March delivery slipped 1 percent to
$764.05 an ounce on the Nymex, ending a four-session rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
