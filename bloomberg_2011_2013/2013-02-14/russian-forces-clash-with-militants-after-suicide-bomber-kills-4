Russian law-enforcement forces are
engaged in a shootout with a militant group in the southern
republic of Dagestan after four policemen were killed today by a
suicide bomber.  Interior Ministry detachments are trying to block militants
in the woods not far from the site of the blast, a spokesman for
Dagestan’s police said by phone from the regional capital of
Makhachkala, declining to be identified in line with local
policy.  A car bomb was detonated at 4:40 a.m. at the entrance to
the city of Khasavyurt after a vehicle was stopped for a police
inspection, Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a  statement 
on its website. Four police officers were killed and six injured
in the explosion, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
