Iberia, the Spanish carrier, said it
will cut more than half of its domestic flights as it works with
partners to minimize the impact of a strike set to start Monday.  Some 90 percent of long-haul flights, 61 percent of mid-
range international flights, and 46 percent of intra-Spain
flights will operate, the Madrid-based unit of  International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA , said today. Plans for operations
during further strikes periods announced by unions for next
month will be finalized in the coming days, it said.  IAG Chief Executive Officer  Willie Walsh  wants to shrink
Iberia operations by 15 percent and said this week the airline
is moving ahead with plans to shed 3,147 positions in a bid to
restore the carrier to profitability. Spanish labor rules
require unions to provide a minimum level of service.  Iberia said it has made “arrangements with its partners in
the Oneworld alliance and another ten airlines to carry Iberia
passengers as needed,” the airline said. The contingency plan
also relaxed ticketing terms to ease changes.  The airline urged labor groups on Feb. 12 “to settle
disputes at the bargaining table rather than involving customers
through strikes that can only aggravate the airline’s loss-
making situation.”  IAG declined as much as 4.6 pence, or 2 percent, to 220.40
pence, and traded at 224.2 pence as of 1:49 p.m., valuing the
company at 4.16 billion pounds ($6.5 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
