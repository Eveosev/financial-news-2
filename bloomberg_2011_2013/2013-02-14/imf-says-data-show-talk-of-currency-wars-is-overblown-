International Monetary Fund
spokesman  Gerry Rice  said that talk of international currency
wars is “overblown.”  “Our multilateral assessment does not indicate very
significant deviations from fair value for the relevant
currencies,” Rice told a news conference in Washington today.  Finance officials from the Group of 20 countries are
meeting in Moscow this week with an emphasis on exchange rate
volatility. Officials should take a stronger stance against
currency manipulation, Russian Finance Minister  Anton Siluanov 
said after conflicting statements on the weakening yen roiled
markets.  “These are obviously developments to watch with an eye on
a cooperative approach and of course, the IMF will do its part
in this effort,” Rice said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
