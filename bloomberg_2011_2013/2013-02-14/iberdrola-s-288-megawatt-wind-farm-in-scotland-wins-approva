Iberdrola SA ’s ScottishPower
Renewables unit won government approval for a 400 million-pound
($620 million) wind farm after scaling back the number of
turbines at the Scottish site to allay environmental concerns.  The 288-megawatt Kilgallioch wind farm in Dumfries and
Galloway and South Ayrshire, boasting 96 turbines, will power
more than 170,000 homes, the company said today in a  statement .
 Initial plans  included 132 turbines producing 396 megawatts.  Scotland has a target to get all its power from renewable
sources by the end of the decade, compared with about 27 percent
in 2011. Planned wind parks are presented to local groups for
consultation to address potential concerns that they’ll have a
detrimental effect on the environment or communities.  The Kilgallioch project, Iberdrola’s second-largest onshore
wind farm, will take two years to build starting in late 2014 or
early the following year. The biggest onshore wind plant in the
U.K. is the 539-megawatt Whitelee venture, according to
ScottishPower, also the project’s developer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
