Erik Karlsson , the reigning Norris
Trophy winner as the National Hockey League’s top defenseman,
will be out indefinitely after his Achilles tendon was cut by a
skate blade during the Ottawa Senators’ loss in Pittsburgh last
night.  Karlsson was injured when he got tangled up with the
Penguins’  Matt Cooke  along the boards during the 4-2 defeat. No
penalty was called on the play.  “He’s a player that’s irreplaceable,” Ottawa goalie  Craig Anderson  told reporters after the game. “It’s exciting to watch
Erik play every night.”  Karlsson leads Ottawa with six goals and ranks second with
10 points. He has averaged 27 minutes, 3 seconds per game, fifth
among all NHL players this season.  The 22-year-old Swede had to be helped off the ice after
the injury occurred late in the second period. As Karlsson was
being checked by Cooke into the boards along the side of the
arena, Cooke’s left foot came off the ice and the blade of his
skate contacted the back of Karlsson’s left leg.  The team hasn’t said how long Karlsson will be out of
action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
