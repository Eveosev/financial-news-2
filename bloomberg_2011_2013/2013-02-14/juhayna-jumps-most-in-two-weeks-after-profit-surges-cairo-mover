Juhayna Food Industries  climbed the
most in two weeks after the expansion at Egypt’s biggest
publicly traded dairy and juice company led to a surge in full-
year profit.  The shares  of the Cairo-based company, which is recovering
from a fire that destroyed its main yogurt plant in 2010, rose
2.5 percent, the most since Jan. 31, to 8.72 Egyptian pounds at
the close in Cairo. That contrasts with an 0.3 percent decline
for the benchmark  EGX 30 Index . The stock has gained 13 percent
this year, more than double the increase in the EGX 30 Index.  Profit soared 75 percent to 325.4 million pounds ($48
million) as the company opened five stores and added 140
distribution vehicles, it said in a statement to the Cairo
bourse today. The rebuilding of its yogurt factory near Cairo
and construction on another in Assiut are 70 percent complete,
it said. The facilities are set to start this year.  “They’ve been investing heavily for the last couple of
years and it’s paying off,” said  Hatem Alaa , equity analyst at
Cairo-based EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, who has a buy rating on the
stock. “They still have much room for growth and their
financials haven’t been affected by bouts of unrest last year so
the medium-term outlook remains robust.”  Juhayna, which relies on buying its milk from independent
farmers, said its first dairy farm is also scheduled to start
“partial operations” this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
