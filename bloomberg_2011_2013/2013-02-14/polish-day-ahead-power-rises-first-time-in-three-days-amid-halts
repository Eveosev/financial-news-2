Day-ahead electricity in Poland rose
for the first time in three days amid unplanned outages of power
units.  Electricity  for the next day advanced 1.9 percent to 169.73
zloty ($54.27) a megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  PGE SA , Poland’s largest utility, halted a 380-megawatt
unit at its Belchatow power plant, while a 235-megawatt facility
at Turow was set to be off line from tomorrow to Feb. 24. A 220-
megawatt unit at Jaworzno, owned by Tauron Polska Energia SA,
will stop tomorrow and start on Feb. 18, grid operator and
utilities data show.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia rose 3.2 percent to 48.18 euros ($64.29) a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countries’
market operators.  Hungarian day-ahead power  settled 3.1 percent
higher, also at 48.18 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
