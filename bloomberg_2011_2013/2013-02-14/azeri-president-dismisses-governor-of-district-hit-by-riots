Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev  fired
the governor of the northwestern Ismayilli District that was hit
by two days of riots last month after the regional leader’s
nephew allegedly beat a taxi driver and insulted residents.  Nizami Alakbarov was replaced as Ismayilli governor by
Mirsadiq Sadiqov, rector of Azerbaijan’s Agrarian University,
according to a presidential  decree  published today by state news
service Azartac.  The governor has denied the accusations against his nephew,
who’s also a son of Labor and Social Protection Minister Fizuli
Alakbarov.  Dozens of people were arrested after residents of
Ismayilli, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) northwest of the
capital, Baku, rioted Jan. 23 and 24, demanding the governor’s
resignation.  Aliyev on Jan. 12 accused some of his governors and their
relatives of mistreating and insulting people. In comments
broadcast on state TV channel AzTV, Aliyev said he’d fire and
arrest those who continue to behave “obnoxiously.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
