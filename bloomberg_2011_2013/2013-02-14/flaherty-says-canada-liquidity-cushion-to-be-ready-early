Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said
the Canadian government will finish building a liquidity cushion
by the middle of 2013, which will bolster investor confidence in
the country’s bonds.  The government had originally planned to complete the plan,
which will increase liquidity levels by C$35 billion ($35
billion), by March 2014.  “Given strong and continuing demand for government of
Canada securities, it is both advantageous and prudent to have
the government’s prudential liquidity plan in place a full nine
months ahead of schedule,” Flaherty said today in a  statement 
posted on his department’s website.  The plan, originally announced in Flaherty’s 2011 budget,
increases government deposits with financial institutions and
the Bank of Canada. The cushion means Canada is adopting the
international standard for banks by covering at least one month
of its projected cash flows, including coupon payments and debt
refinancing, Flaherty said in the statement.  Canada has boosted its liquid foreign exchange reserves by
C$10 billion and government deposits held with financial
institutions and the Bank of Canada have risen by $15 billion,
Flaherty said in the statement. Deposits held with the Bank of
Canada will increase by another $10 billion by “the summer,”
according to the statement.  The government said in 2011 the cushion would have no
impact on the budget balance, since additional borrowing would
be offset by a rise in returns on interest-bearing assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
