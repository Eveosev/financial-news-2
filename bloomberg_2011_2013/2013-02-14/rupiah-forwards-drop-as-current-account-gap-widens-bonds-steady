Indonesia’s three-month rupiah
forwards fell after a central bank report showed the nation’s
current-account deficit widened. Bonds were little changed.  The  shortfall  in the broadest measure of trade increased to
$7.8 billion last quarter, compared with the $7.4 billion median
estimate in a Bloomberg news survey and $5.3 billion in the
prior period, according to figures published yesterday. The
local currency weakened 6.3 percent in the past year as imports
of oil, sold locally at subsidized prices, contributed to the
worsening current-account balance.  “It’s the current-account segment that’s really weighing
on the rupiah’s prospects,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “There’s no near-
term reason for the rupiah to significantly strengthen against
the U.S. dollar.”  Three-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.3 percent
to 9,713 per dollar as of 9:03 a.m. in Jakarta, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The contracts traded at a 0.5 percent discount
to the spot rate, which fell 0.1 percent to 9,660, according to
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was
set at 9,643 per dollar yesterday by the Association of Banks in
Singapore. That’s 0.4 percent stronger than 9,685 on Feb. 8.
Markets in the city-state were closed Feb. 11 and yesterday for
the Chinese New Year holidays.  The rupiah’s one-month implied volatility, which measures
expected exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped 28
basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, to 6.23 percent.  Indonesia will have to address the uncertainty over oil
subsidies, which will stoke concern over its growth outlook and
currency,  Benedict Bingham , the International Monetary Fund’s
senior resident representative, said on Jan. 31 in Jakarta.  The yield on Indonesia’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
was little changed at 5.26 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
