Automatic budget cuts would create
flight delays as U.S. aviation regulators and air-traffic
controllers take unpaid furloughs, a congressional report
released today says.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration expects to
furlough every employee for 11 days this year if automatic cuts
go into effect on March 1, according to a report by House
Appropriations Committee  Democrats .  The FAA would have to cut funding of key operations by
about $483 million, according to the report. In order to make up
that deficit, as many as 10 percent of the FAA’s workers would
be on furlough on any given day, it said.  The effect would be “reduced air-traffic control, longer
delays and economic losses for air transportation, tourism and
the economy as a whole,” according to the report.  Automatic cuts known as sequestration will take effect
March 1 unless President Barack Obama and lawmakers can reach a
budget agreement. The FAA would face total reductions of about
$627 million for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, according to a
letter to FAA employees from Administrator Michael Huerta. The
agency has an annual budget of about $16 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
