Hitoshi Asaoka , a Tokyo-based senior
strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s
third-largest bank by market value, talks about today’s Bank of
Japan’s decision and the central bank’s policy outlook.  The BOJ refrained from adding to stimulus ahead of
leadership changes next month, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
calls for boosting stimulus.  “The market consensus was no action this time as its focus
shifts to BOJ’s personnel changes and what new leadership will
do.  ‘‘The BOJ introduced a 2 percent inflation target following
the birth of the Abe administration, and they may add to
monetary easing one after another in a preventive way from here.
That will be new and justifiable.  ‘‘Expectations remain high for the Abe administration and
for the BOJ. The stock rally won’t slow down.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
