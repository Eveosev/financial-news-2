Contractors working on the
construction of a high-speed highway between the Vietnamese
capital Hanoi and the port city of Haiphong should
“drastically” accelerate the pace, the government said.  The process of building the 105-kilometer (65 miles)
highway has been slow, with roughly a third of the road
complete, according to  a posting  on the Vietnamese government
website that cited Transportation Minister  Dinh La Thang . Delays
have been largely related to soft ground and land clearance, the
government said.  Contractors told Thang yesterday they were committed to
ensuring the highway would be operational by 2015.  In 2011, the Vietnam Infrastructure Development & Finance
Investment Joint-Stock Co., which was assigned in 2007 by the
government to be the project investor, set a target for the
highway to become operational in 2013. Earlier plans called for
the project to be completed in 2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story
