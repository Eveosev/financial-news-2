New Zealand’s dollar touched a 2
1/2-year high against Australia’s as the smaller nation’s retail
sales grew faster than economists predicted, boosting bets its
central bank will raise interest rates.  The so-called kiwi climbed to its strongest in 17 months
against the greenback as non-resident holdings of the nation’s
sovereign debt rose to the most since October 2009. The
Australian and New Zealand dollars are both poised to gain
against the U.S. currency this week as speculation global growth
will quicken boosts demand for higher-yielding assets.  “The New Zealand economy is in recovery and outperforming
its peers, and the kiwi dollar is likely to push higher,” said
 Mike Jones , a currency strategist at Bank of New Zealand in
Wellington. “The Reserve Bank has a mild tightening bias, and
in a world of easy policy and quantitative easing, a tightening
bias is all you need to stand out from the pack.”  New Zealand’s currency traded at NZ$1.2180 per Aussie
dollar at 4:52 p.m. in Sydney, after climbing to NZ$1.2143, the
highest since July 2010. It added 0.1 percent to 85.12 U.S.
cents after touching 85.34, the most since September 2011. The
kiwi advanced 1.9 percent against the greenback this week. It
lost 0.3 percent to 78.81 yen today.  Australia’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to $1.0366, poised for
a 0.5 percent weekly advance. It slid 0.2 percent to 95.98 yen
and has gained 0.4 percent this week.  The New Zealand dollar’s  trade-weighted index  rose as much
as 0.5 percent to 77.50, the highest since it was freely floated
in 1985.  Swap Rates  Retail sales adjusted for inflation surged 2.1 percent in
the three months through December from the third quarter,
Statistics New Zealand said today. The gain was the most since
the fourth quarter of 2006 and exceeded the 1.4 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 economists.  A Credit Suisse Group AG  index  showed the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand will probably increase borrowing costs by 29 basis
points over 12 months.  New Zealand’s two-year swap  rate , a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates which is sensitive to interest-rate
expectations, slid two basis points to 3.03 percent after
touching 3.07 percent, the highest since April 2. It has climbed
35 1/2 basis points this year.  The kiwi may rise toward NZ$1.17 per Aussie dollar by mid-
year and NZ$1.13 by year-end, said Bank of New Zealand’s Jones.
It will gain to 87 U.S. cents by Dec. 31, he said.  The Aussie dollar maintained its weekly advance after
Reserve Bank of Australia Assistant Governor Christopher Kent
said China’s demand for commodities will grow “strongly” for
some time. There are signs that growth in China is stabilizing,
he said. The nation is Australia’s largest trading partner.  Australia’s benchmark 10-year  bond yield  fell seven basis
points to 3.52 percent, ending three days of increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
