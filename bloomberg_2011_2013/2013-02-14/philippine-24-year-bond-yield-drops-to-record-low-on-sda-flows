Philippine 24-year bonds advanced
for a sixth day, pushing the yield to a record low, as investors
continued to shift funds to sovereign debt from central bank
accounts. The peso strengthened, touching a one-month high.  The yield on the notes due 2037 has fallen 63 basis points
since Jan. 23, the day before the central bank cut the interest
rate on almost 1.7 trillion pesos ($42 billion) in its special-
deposit accounts. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is preparing its
next phase of foreign-exchange liberalization as it studies
measures that will encourage outward dollar flows, Deputy
Governor Diwa Guinigundo said yesterday.  “Maturing placements in special-deposit accounts are being
shifted to government bonds,” said  Antonio Espedido , treasurer
at China Banking Corp. in Manila. “There’s a lot of liquidity
after the moves of the central bank with respect to the SDAs.”  The yield on the 6.125 percent government securities due
October 2037 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
4.91 percent as of 12:06 p.m. in Manila, according to prices
from Tradition Financial Services. That was the lowest level
since they were first sold in October.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 40.628 per dollar, data from
Tullett Prebon Plc show. It touched 40.550 earlier, the
strongest level since Jan. 14. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, dropped five basis points to 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
