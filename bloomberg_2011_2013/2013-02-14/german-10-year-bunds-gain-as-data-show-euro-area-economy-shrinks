German 10-year bonds advanced after
a report showed the euro region’s recession deepened more than
economists forecast in the fourth quarter of 2012.  The yield on German 10-year bonds fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.66 percent as of 10:04 a.m. London
time. The two-year rate also dropped two basis points, to 0.20
percent.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation region fell 0.6
percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
The median forecast of 45 economists in a Bloomberg survey
predicted a 0.4 percent contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
