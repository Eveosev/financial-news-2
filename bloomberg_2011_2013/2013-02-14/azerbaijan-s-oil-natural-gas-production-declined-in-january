Azerbaijan, the largest oil producer
in the former Soviet Union after Russia and Kazakhstan, pumped
less crude and natural gas last month.  The Caspian Sea nation produced 3.8 million metric tons of
oil in January, down 3.1 percent from a year earlier, the State
Statistics Committee based in the capital, Baku, said today on
its  website . Production of marketable gas fell 4.7 percent to
1.5 billion cubic meters, it said, without giving a reason for
the decline.  Azerbaijan’s oil output dropped to 43 million tons for a
second year in 2012 as its largest deposit -– Azeri-Chirag-
Guneshli, which is led by  BP Plc  -– cut production. The country
increased production of marketable gas last year 5.4 percent to
17 billion cubic meters, the State Statistics Committee said
Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
