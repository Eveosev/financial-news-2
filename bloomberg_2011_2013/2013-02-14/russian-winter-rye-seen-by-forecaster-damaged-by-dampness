Winter rye in Russia, the world’s
second-biggest producer of the grain, was damaged by excess
moisture, the national weather center said.  Eleven percent to 20 percent of winter rye seeds failed to
sprout on 3 percent of the sown area, Anna Strashnaya, head of
the center’s agro-meteorological forecasts department, said
yesterday in a phone interview in Moscow. Last year, winter rye
sprouted well on all fields, she said. Rye plantings were
damaged when snow layers as thick as 45 centimeters (17.7
inches) started to melt under weak frosts in Russia’s central
regions of Tver, Yaroslavl, Smolensk, Vladimir, Ivanovo and
Kostroma.  “This means rye is in a worse condition than a year
earlier,” Strashnaya said. If more rye, or at least 30 percent,
of the planted seeds fail to sprout by the spring that starts in
March in Russia, farmers will have to re-plant rye for the
2013-14 crop, she said.  Russia’s rye harvest dropped 30 percent to 2.1 million
metric tons this season from 3 million tons in the previous
period because of drought, according to the state statistics
data. Russia is the second-biggest producer after the European
Union, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.
Russia uses rye in breads and feedstuffs, and exports the grain
by itself or in a mixture with wheat known as meslin. Rye
accounted for about 3 percent of the national grain crop this
season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
