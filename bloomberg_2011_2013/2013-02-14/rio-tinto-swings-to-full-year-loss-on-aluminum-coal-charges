Rio Tinto Group , the world’s second-
largest mining company, swung to its first full-year loss in at
least 21 years after taking a $14 billion one-time charge on
the value of its aluminum and coal businesses.  The  loss  was $3 billion in the 12 months to Dec. 31, from
$5.8 billion profit a year ago, London-based Rio said today in a
statement. The result beat the average forecast loss of $4
billion of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The writedowns saw  Sam Walsh  last month named as chief
executive officer, replacing  Tom Albanese  who signed off on the
$38 billion takeover of aluminum producer Alcan Inc. in 2007
that saw its debt rise as much as 19-fold. Declining prices,
rising costs and slowing demand saw global mining companies wipe
billions off project valuations in the past year.  “We don’t expect Walsh to outline a major change in
company direction, ” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts  Lyndon Fagan 
and  Fraser Jamieson  said in a report before the results.
“However, capital discipline will be front of mind following
$35 billion of impairments over the past six years.”  Rio  rose 2.3 percent to A$72.07 at the close of trading in
Sydney. The key S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.7 percent. Rio’s
shares rose 9.5 percent last year,  compared  with a 7.8 percent
gain for BHP, the biggest mining company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
