Cattle futures fell to a three-month
low on signs of waning export demand for U.S. beef. Hogs also
declined.  U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed today that beef-
export sales fell to 7,302 metric tons (16.1 million pounds) in
the week ended Feb. 7, down 25 percent from a week earlier.
Meatpackers processed 353,000 cattle in the first three days of
this week, down 1.9 percent from a year earlier.  “To get a really good market going, you need some export
business,”  Chad Henderson , the president of Prime Agricultural
Consulting Inc., said in a telephone interview from Brookfield,
Wisconsin. “On the beef side, that’s on shaky ground.”  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1.29125 a pound at 10:25 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price slumped as much as 1.4 percent to
$1.276, the lowest for a most-active contract since Nov. 12.  Through yesterday, cattle dropped 2.2 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement rose 0.1 percent
to $1.4155 a pound. Earlier, the commodity touched $1.39175, the
lowest since July 31.  Hog futures for April settlement declined 1.4 percent to
84.625 cents a pound. Earlier, the price touched 84.425 cents,
the lowest since Jan. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
