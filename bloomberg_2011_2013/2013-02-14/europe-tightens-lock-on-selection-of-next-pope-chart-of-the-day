Europe, home to 35 percent of
Catholics, raised its representation in the college of cardinals
to more than half since the last papal election, increasing the
odds that the leaders of the church will pick a European for the
100th time.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows European cardinals now make up
52 percent of the Conclave while the proportion of cardinals
from Africa and Latin America has fallen since 1978, when John
Paul II was elected.  Catholics made up 65 percent of Europe’s population in 1910
and 24 percent in 2010, according to the Pew Research Center. A
century ago, 26 percent of the world’s Catholics lived in Italy
and France. Now, just 8.1 percent do.  Both  Benedict XVI , a German, and his predecessor, a Pole,
promoted to the top like-minded clergy who shared their
conservative views. The resulting configuration of the church’s
hierarchy reflects this theological and geographic bias,
according to Father  Thomas Reese , author of “Inside the
Vatican” and a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological
Center at Georgetown University in Washington.  Benedict has hand-picked more than half the cardinals who
will elect his successor, Reese said. “He has done what anyone
would do -- chosen men who agree with him.”  Italy, which has produced 217 popes over the millenia, has
contributed a quarter of the cardinals of the Conclave.  To contact the reporters on this story:
