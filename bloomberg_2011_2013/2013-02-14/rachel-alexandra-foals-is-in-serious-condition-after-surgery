Rachel Alexandra, the 2009 Horse of
the Year, is in serious condition after undergoing surgery
yesterday to repair her small colon, which she bruised during
the birth of her filly, Stonestreet Farm said.  The 10-year-old mare is recovering at Rood and Riddle
Equine Clinic in Lexington, Kentucky.  “She’s showing the same strength and courage now that she
demonstrated on the track,” owner  Barbara Banke  said on her
Facebook page. “Our hearts are broken by this turn of events.”  Rachel Alexandra’s 140-pound filly, sired by 2006 Preakness
Stakes winner Bernardini, was born at 2:30 a.m. on Feb. 12 and
has returned to Stonestreet Farm, where she will be tended by a
nurse mare.  Rachel Alexandra also gave birth to a 125-pound colt on
Jan. 22, 2012, at Stonestreet Farm. Its sire is Curlin, who in
2008 became the first thoroughbred since Cigar in 1996 to retain
Horse of the Year honors.  Curlin won 11 of 16 starts in two years and won $10.5
million in prize money, capturing the 2007 Breeders’ Cup Classic
and the Preakness.  Rachel Alexandra went undefeated in 2009. After a 20 1/2-
length win in the Kentucky Oaks, she won the Preakness Stakes,
the second event in racing’s Triple Crown. The late  Jess Jackson , owner of Stonestreet Farm, bought her after the
Kentucky Oaks victory.  Rachel Alexandra opened 2010 with two runner-up finishes
before claiming the Fleur De Lis Handicap and the Lady’s Secret
Stakes. She finished second in the Personal Ensign Stakes on
Aug. 29, her final race.  She was retired in September 2010 without competing against
Zenyatta, the 2010 Horse of the Year, who won 19 of her 20
starts including the male-dominated Breeders’ Cup Classic in
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
