U.K. commercial real estate values
fell for the 15th consecutive month in January led by a decline
in retail, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses
declined 0.2 percent from December, London-based IPD said in a
statement today. Total return, which combines changes in real
estate values and rental income, was 0.4 percent in January.  “There are some encouraging signs starting to emerge, with
pockets of improvement emerging around the U.K.,” Phil Tily, a
managing director at IPD, said in the statement. “With the
pricing so keen for Central London assets, there may be more
movement amongst investors to seek better value in the
regions.”  Britain faces a muted economic recovery and a further bout
of inflation, Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  said
yesterday. The Confederation of British Industry, the U.K.’s
biggest business lobby group, also lowered its 2013 economic-
growth projection to 1 percent from 1.4 percent.  The value of office buildings in the City of London
financial district fell for the first time since July. Capital
growth slowed in the London’s West End office and retail
markets, IPD said. Retail values overall declined by 0.3
percent.  The IPD index was compiled from appraisals of 3,427
properties valued at 31.5 billion pounds ($48.8 billion) at the
end of January.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Neil Callanan in London at
