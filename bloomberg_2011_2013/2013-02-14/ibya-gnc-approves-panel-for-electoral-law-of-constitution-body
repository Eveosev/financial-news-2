Libya’s General National Congress
approved a three-member committee to write a law for the
election to a Constitutional Commission charged with drafting
the country’s charter.  The three people represent Libya’s three historic regions -
- the east, Cyrenaica; the south, Fezzan; and Tripolitania.  No timeline has been set for the completion of the law or
for holding the vote, Omar Hamidan, a spokesman for the GNC,
told reporters late yesterday in Tripoli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
