Iran started a natural gas liquid
project in the Sirri Island in the Persian Gulf, to exploit
condensate and collect associated gas, the Oil Ministry News
website Shana reported.  The Sirri NGL, which came onstream today after being
inaugurated by the President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has the
capacity to process 3.5 million cubic meters of associated gas a
day into feedstock for petrochemical plants and injection to
national gas grid, Shana said.  The early output  of the plant is 70 million cubic meters
of products a day and will increase to 143 million, according to
the report. The facility will produce propane, butane, pentane
and gas condensate.  The project started in 2004 and cost $251 million to
construct, according to the presidentâ€™s news website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
