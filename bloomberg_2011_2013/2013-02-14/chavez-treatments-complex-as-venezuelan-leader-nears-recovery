Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  is
receiving “complex and difficult” medical treatments as the
South American leader nears recovery from an undisclosed cancer,
Vice President  Nicolas Maduro  said.  “They are complex treatments that should at some point
close the cycle of treatment for his disease,” Maduro, who said
he had just arrived from Cuba, said today on state television.
“He is assimilating all this with, as he would say, a battling
spirit.”  The government hasn’t given an official health update on
Chavez since Jan. 26 when Information Minister Ernesto Villegas
said the former paratrooper had overcome a lung infection he
contracted after the Dec. 11 surgery in Cuba. Chavez was still
having some breathing problems, Villegas said.  Maduro and other top officials carried religious statues to
Chavez last week, according to photos posted on Villegas’
Twitter account. Chavez studied satellite images of Venezuela
and gave instructions about land use, Technology Minister Jorge
Arreaza said in messages posted on his Twitter account Feb. 11.  Chavez hasn’t been seen or heard from publicly since
arriving in Havana Dec. 10 for his fourth cancer-related surgery
in 18 months. Before leaving Venezuela he anointed Maduro his
successor should he die or step down.  If either occur before Chavez completes a third six-year
term, the constitution states elections must be held within 30
days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
