Hungary’s recession deepened in the
fourth quarter as austerity measures hurt domestic demand, a
drought hit agriculture output, the euro region’s debt crisis
weakened exports and western banks withdrew funding.  The economy shrank 0.9 percent in October-December from the
previous three months for a fourth consecutive quarterly drop.
Gross domestic product fell 2.7 percent compared with a year
earlier, the most in three years, the statistics office in
Budapest said today in a preliminary report. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey expected a 1.9 percent drop from a year ago.  While the government on Jan. 25 said that the economy may
grow more than the forecast 0.9 percent this year as car
production and agriculture output rise, the  International
Monetary Fund  on Feb. 11 said it may stagnate in 2013.  “Industrial and agriculture output, domestic consumption
and exports all dropped and contributed to the recession,”
statistician Pal Pozsonyi told reporters today.  Hungary is in its second recession in four years as trade
and banking links with the slumping euro area drag down growth.
Foreign lenders forced to pay Europe’s largest bank levy are
withdrawing capital and funding, restricting credit. Measures to
cut the budget deficit to avoid a freeze in European Union
development funds have hurt business and consumer confidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
