Solon Corp., a solar power-plant
provider, completed construction of a photovoltaic system at a
reverse-osmosis water-treatment facility in the southern Arizona
town of Gila Bend. No costs were disclosed.  Solon said in a statement that the system is expected to
offset the energy usage of the water-treatment plant by 86
percent, saving the town money by reducing utility bills. The
project was financed through an Arizona state water
infrastructure finance authority grant for drinking water
improvements, Solon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
