Actavis Inc. ’s generic version of
the painkiller Fentora wouldn’t infringe two patents owned by
 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ’s Cephalon unit, a U.S.
appeals court ruled today.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit  upheld  a
finding the generic version made by Actavis didn’t copy the way
the drug is delivered into the system through a mucous membrane.
The appeals court did overturn a lower court ruling that the
patents are invalid, reviving the patents so Cephalon can assert
them against other companies.  The infringement decision is largely symbolic as another
patent owned by Cephalon prevents Actavis, which recently
changed its name from Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., from entering
the market until October 2019. Fentora is approved to relieve
sudden episodes of cancer pain in adults already taking opioids,
or morphine-like drugs.  “The decision was favorable in terms of infringement, but
we still can’t launch,” said  Charlie Mayr , a spokesman for
Parsippany, New Jersey-based Actavis.  Teva, based in Petach Tikva, Israel, bought Cephalon in
2011. The company is asserting the two patents in this case,
along with two others, in a case against Mylan Inc. that is
scheduled for trial in March, said  Denise Bradley , a Teva
spokeswoman.  The case is Cephalon Inc. v. Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
2011-1325, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is Cephalon Inc. v. Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc., 08cv330, U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
