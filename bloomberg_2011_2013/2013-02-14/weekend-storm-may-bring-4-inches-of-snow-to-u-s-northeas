New York City, Long Island and parts
of southern New England may receive 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10
centimeters) of snow from a system expected to develop early
Feb. 16 along an Arctic cold front.  Temperatures plunging into the low 30s Fahrenheit (about
minus 1 Celsius) starting late tomorrow may help set off a round
of snow from New York to Massachusetts, according to the
 National Weather Service . Newark, New Jersey, may receive 1 to 3
inches and Boston may get 1 to 2.  “There is a 60 percent chance of snow Saturday morning,”
David Stark, a weather service meteorologist in Upton, New York,
said by telephone. “It’s a highly uncertain forecast and there
are still a lot of questions we need to answer.”  The Northeast from New York to New England was struck by a
blizzard a week ago that left 24.9 inches on Boston, the fifth-
most on record, and as much as 40 inches on Hamden, Connecticut,
according to the agency. The storm killed at least seven people,
left about 613,000 customers from Maine to New York without
power at its peak and crippled travel.  New York’s temperature at 4:45 p.m. today was 46 degrees,
and the high’s expected to be 49 tomorrow. Stark said the mild
weather will give way to much colder air over the weekend.  The low is forecast to be 22 degrees late Feb. 16, when the
snow should end, and 17 the next night, according to the
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
