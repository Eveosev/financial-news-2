Mary Miller , U.S. Treasury
undersecretary for domestic finance, said efforts to repeal the
Dodd-Frank law will hamper growth and urged international
regulators to enhance the stability of the global banking
system.  Repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory act in “whole or
piecemeal” will hamper growth, Miller said in the text of
remarks to a Senate Banking Committee hearing today. “We cannot
afford to succumb to complacency now as the financial markets
and economy slowly continue to recovery.”  Miller, along with officials from agencies including the
Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., are
scheduled to appear before the committee at a hearing on
implementation of the Dodd-Frank act.  “As the global economy heals from the devastation of the
crisis, urgency for reform may wane,” Miller said. “Progress
remains uneven internationally, and significant work remains.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
