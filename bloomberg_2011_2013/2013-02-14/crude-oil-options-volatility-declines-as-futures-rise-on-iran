Crude oil options volatility slid as
the underlying futures advanced after United Nations nuclear
inspectors failed to reach a deal with Iran.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 16.73 percent on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as of 4:20 p.m., compared with 17.54 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery rose 30
cents to settle at $97.90 a barrel on the Nymex. Open interest
climbed to a record yesterday, according to exchange owner CME
Group Inc.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
March $97 puts, which fell 43 cents to 3 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,844 contracts at 4:30 p.m. in New York. March $98
calls were the second-most active with 1,859 lots. They declined
12 cents to 1 cent.  Calls accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading
volume. In the previous session, bearish bets calls made up 63
percent of the 145,887 contracts traded.  December $93 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 6,000 contracts changing hands. They were
unchanged at $5.31. December $77 puts declined 15 cents to $4.39
a barrel on 6,000 lots.  Open interest was highest for March $85 puts with 42,491
