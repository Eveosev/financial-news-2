Morgan Stanley, the bank with the
most debt  maturing  in 2013 of the top 10 U.S. structured note
issuers, led monthly sales for the first time in more than a
year.  The bank issued $498.8 million of the securities in January
in 51 offerings, more than twice its monthly average of $238.4
million in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan
Stanley was last No. 1 in the U.S. in August 2011, when it sold
$1.1 billion of notes.  The bank fell to eighth-largest structured note issuer last
year when its five-year credit default swaps averaged 309.2
basis points after being on top in 2010 when the measure of risk
was 180.6, Bloomberg data show. While the current level of 149.2
basis points is close to an almost two-year low, it’s still
higher than that of any other U.S. bank that issues the
securities, forcing the company to pay more for funds and create
more attractive terms on debt.  That means the bank can be more “creative” with
structuring notes to get investor attention, said  John Tessar ,
senior vice president at JVB Financial Group LLC in Boca Raton,
Florida.  Banks create the investments by packaging their own debt
with derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors
while earning fees and raising money.  Moody’s Rating  Moody’s Investors Service rates Morgan Stanley, which has
$26.1 billion of debt maturing this year, as  Baa1  with a
negative outlook. Wells Fargo & Co., which has the lowest credit
risk among U.S issuers as indicated by the level of its default
swaps, is graded A2, or two levels higher.  Credit swaps typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves. They pay the buyer face
value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Lauren Onis , a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank,
declined to comment on the company’s issuance.  Morgan Stanley’s largest offering last month was $110
million of 15-year, auto-callable step-up notes tied to the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The securities, sold Jan. 15, start
out yielding 7 percent annually, then rise to 8 percent after
five years and end at 12 percent so long as the stock benchmark
doesn’t fall below 70 percent of its initial value, according to
a  prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Investors can lose their entire investment. The bank
distributed the notes for a 3.5 percent commission.  Outside the U.S., Morgan Stanley sold the most notes in
five years. The bank has raised $194.1 million in 2013, the most
for any similar period since 2008, according to Bloomberg data
that exclude securities where amount of principal returned can
vary.  Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from
stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, or events such as
changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
