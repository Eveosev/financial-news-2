  BT Group Plc ’s U.S. unit was sued
by  Google Inc.  over claims it infringed four patents related to
network communications including through voice-over-Internet
services that BT Americas provides.  Google, owner of the world’s most popular Internet search
engine, filed a complaint yesterday in federal court in Los
Angeles. The Mountain View, California-based company seeks a
court order preventing BT Americas from continuing its alleged
infringements of the patents as well as unspecified damages.  BT, based in London, accused Google in a 2011 lawsuit of
infringing six of its U.S. patents for mobile-device technology.  “BT has brought several meritless patent claims against
Google and our customers -- and they’ve also been arming patent
trolls,”  Niki Fenwick , a Google spokeswoman, said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. “When faced with these kind of
actions, we will defend ourselves.”  Kris Kozamchak, a BT spokeswoman, said yesterday in an e-
mail that the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation.  The case is Google v. BT Americas, 13-00254, U.S. District
Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
