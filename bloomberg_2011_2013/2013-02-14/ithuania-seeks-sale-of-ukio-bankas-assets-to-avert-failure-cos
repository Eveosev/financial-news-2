Lithuania’s central bank told the
administrator of  Ukio Bankas AB  to negotiate the sale of the
insolvent lender’s assets to keep the institution’s collapse
from having an impact on the state budget.  “The temporary administrator has been given permission to
begin preliminary negotiations with  Siauliu Bankas , which has
already expressed interest in taking over the assets, rights,
contracts and liabilities of Ukio Bankas, as well as with other
banks that have expressed similar interest,” the Bank of
Lithuania in Vilnius, the capital, said today by e-mail.  The government and the central bank, which suspended Ukio’s
operations on Feb. 12, want to avoid its bankruptcy, which would
require payments of as much as 2.6 billion litai ($1 billion)
from the state deposit-insurance fund. The fund itself would
have to borrow the money from the government, which also helped
it survive the bankruptcy of  Snoras Bankas AB  in 2011.  Siauliu Bankas AB, supported by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, its largest shareholder, said
yesterday it wanted to begin talks on buying Ukio’s “good”
assets.  Preliminary data showed Ukio’s liabilities were 500 million
litai more than its assets, according to the Bank of Lithuania.
That is mainly due to 1.6 billion litai of risky loans that the
bank granted to companies related to its 64.9 percent owner,
Vladimir Romanov, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
