Peru’s sol rose to its strongest
against the dollar in two weeks as exporters sold the U.S.
currency to pay local income taxes.  The sol appreciated 0.2 percent to 2.5675 per U.S. dollar
at today’s close, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the strongest close since Jan. 30.  The central bank intervened to stem the gains, buying $280
million today in the currency market, the most in a week,
according to its website. The price was an average 2.5669 soles
per dollar, according to the website.  “Historically February has always been a month where sales
are very high and this year’s no different,” said  Antonio Diaz ,
a trader at Banco Internacional del Peru SAA in Lima. “At the
moment the exchange rate basically depends on how much and at
what price the central bank decides to buy.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was unchanged at 3.78 percent,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price was 126.14
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
