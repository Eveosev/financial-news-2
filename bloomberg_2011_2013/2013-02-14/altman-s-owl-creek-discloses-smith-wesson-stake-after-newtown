Owl Creek Asset Management LP, the
hedge fund led by  Jeffrey Altman , disclosed a 2.4 percent stake
in gunmaker Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. after the massacre of
school children in Newtown, Connecticut.  The fund purchased 1.62 million Smith & Wesson shares in
the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory  filing  today from
New York-based Owl Creek. The filing didn’t show the dates on
which the shares were acquired. Dan Sapadin, Owl Creek’s chief
operating officer, didn’t immediately return a call for comment
on the new holding.  Twenty children and six educators were slain at Sandy Hook
Elementary School on Dec. 14, spurring lawmakers to seek
stricter gun-control measures. Shares of Springfield,
Massachusetts-based Smith & Wesson have climbed 12 percent this
year and are little changed since the day before the shootings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
