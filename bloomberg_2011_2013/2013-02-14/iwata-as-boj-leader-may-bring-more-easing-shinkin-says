Tomomi Yamashita , a senior fund
manager at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, which oversees
about 500 billion yen ($5.6 billion), comments on the Bank of
Japan’s policy decision today. The central bank kept its asset-
purchase fund unchanged at 76 trillion yen ($813 billion) ahead
of Governor Masaaki Shirakawa’s resignation next month.  “The market wasn’t expecting any changes from the BOJ
policy meeting today.  ‘‘There is a lot of expecation about the Bank of Japan’s
future. If the dovish  Kazumasa Iwata  takes the governor’s
position, there is hope we’ll see more monetary easing.  ‘‘Rather than just what the Bank of Japan may do policy-
wise, the optimism is more that the government and BOJ will work
together to help the economic recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
