Colombia’s peso fell for the first
time in five days as the government scaled back plans for
foreign debt sales and said it will buy $1 billion as part of
its bid to ease gains in the local currency.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 1,782 per U.S. dollar at
9:01 a.m. in Bogota. The currency has dropped 0.9 percent this
year as the government and central bank announced increased
dollar purchases to stem a rally that sent the peso to a 17-
month high on Jan. 2.  Colombia will sell $600 million in foreign bonds in the
remainder of this year after issuing $1 billion of notes last
month, Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas told reporters in
Bogota yesterday. The total is down 38 percent from the
$2.6 billion the government had said it would issue.  The Finance Ministry also said yesterday its 2013 financing
needs were reduced by 1.8 trillion pesos ($1 billion) after a
Feb. 8 domestic debt exchange with public entities. The
government will buy that amount in dollars in the currency
market to pay for interest and principal on foreign bonds coming
due this year, Cardenas said yesterday.  The dollar purchases add to Banco de la Republica’s Jan. 28
announcement that it will buy at least $30 million a day,
bringing purchases in the foreign-exchange market to $3 billion
between February and May. A stronger peso curbs exporters’
profit margins.  The yield on Colombia’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.04
percent, according to the central bank. The price rose 0.273
centavo to 142.252 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
