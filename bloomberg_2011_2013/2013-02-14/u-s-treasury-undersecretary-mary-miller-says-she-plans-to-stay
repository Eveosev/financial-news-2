Mary Miller , U.S. Treasury
undersecretary for domestic finance, said she plans to stay in
the job and help  Jack Lew , the Treasury secretary nominee, get
confirmed.  “Right now I’m totally focused on getting our new
secretary confirmed and, you know, my plan is to stay,” Miller
said in a short interview in Washington today. “I have no plans
to go.”  Miller, 57, is the Treasury official responsible for
coordinating five agencies writing the Volcker rule to ban
banks’ proprietary trading under the Dodd-Frank Act. She is
leading the Treasury’s efforts to revamp mortgage companies
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and supervising sales of Treasury
securities.  She was at the center of the August 2011 dispute between
the Obama administration and Standard & Poor’s over the firm’s
first-ever downgrade of U.S. government debt. Treasury officials
found what they called a $2 trillion “basic math error” in
S&P’s explanation of the rating change.  Miller spent 26 years at  T. Rowe Price Group Inc. ,
including as director of fixed income, head of the municipal
bond department and portfolio manager.  She spoke today after her testimony to the Senate Committee
on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs at a hearing on
implementation of Dodd-Frank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
