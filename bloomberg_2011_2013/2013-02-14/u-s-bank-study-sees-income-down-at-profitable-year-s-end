U.S. commercial banks in 2012
recorded their highest annual profits since the 2008 financial
crisis even as they saw a slight decline in net income for the
last quarter, according to a study by Hamilton Place Strategies.  The  report  released today by the Washington-based
consulting firm examined government and industry data. It also
found that banks continued to boost capital, putting the
industry’s Tier One common capital ratio at 12.6 percent.  “That’s measurable, significant improvement,” said  Tim Pawlenty , the former Republican governor of Minnesota who heads
the Financial Services Roundtable, in a call today with
reporters. While banks understand the need for higher capital,
he said, “we also want to make sure that the levels don’t get
so high that you impede investment and economic growth.”  The commercial banks’ loan-to-deposit ratio fell to 70.3
percent as deposits topped an all-time high of $10 trillion,
according to the report, commissioned by the Partnership for a
Secure Financial Future. Domestic business loans exceeded highs
before the crisis, with commercial banks holding $2.1 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
