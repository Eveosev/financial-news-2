Blackstone Group LP ’s hedge-fund
unit said it would keep most of its about $550 million in Steven
Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors LP for another quarter while it
awaits more information on the government’s insider-trading case
against a former portfolio manager at the $14 billion firm.  Over the past week, Blackstone negotiated a deal that gives
all clients three more months to weigh their investment in the
fund and still be able to get all their money out by the end of
the year. Previously, investors could only redeem 25 percent of
their money every quarter, meaning they would have had to tell
the firm by today’s first quarter deadline in order to exit
completely by Dec. 31.  “While we submitted redemptions for certain accounts as
appropriate, BAAM successfully preserved flexibility for our
clients by extending our decision time line,”  Peter Rose , a
Blackstone spokesman, said today in a statement.  “We will use
this period of time to evaluate all additional information which
becomes available.”  Jonathan Gasthalter , a spokesman for SAC, declined to
comment on the new redemption option.  To contact the reporters on this story:
