Praj Industries Ltd. , an engineering
company backed by billionaire  Rakesh Jhunjhunwala , expects to
begin construction on a $30 million biofuel demonstration plant
in India before building one in the U.S.  Construction on the 30,000-litre (7,925-gallon) facility
will begin in May, near the company’s headquarters in Pune,
India, Chairman  Pramod Chaudhari  said today in telephone
interview. Praj Industries has been operating a smaller pilot
plant in India that produces fuel from sugar-cane waste for four
years.  The company expects to design, build and sell its first
“medium-sized” cellulosic-ethanol plant next year, probably in
the U.S., he said. The U.S. plans to mix 16 billion gallons of
biofuels from sources other than corn with gasoline annually by
2022. That will create a $130 billion market for producers of
ethanol equipment, Chaudhari said.  “I hope these projections come true,” Chaudhari said.
“In the long term this is going to be the solution for the
whole biofuel industry.”  Two sites for the demonstration plant have been selected
within 400 kilometers of the company’s headquarters, he said.
Production costs may be as low as $2 a gallon depending on the
cost of raw material.  Praj Industries gets about 80 percent of its revenue from
sales of ethanol-related equipment, he said. This figure will
fall as it diversifies into other areas including waste-water
treatment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
