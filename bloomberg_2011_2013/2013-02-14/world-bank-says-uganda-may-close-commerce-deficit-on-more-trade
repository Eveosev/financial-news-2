Uganda may close its trade deficit
in five years if it removes barriers with its neighbors, the
World Bank said.  East Africa’s third-biggest economy may earn an additional
$2.5 billion in the region, which would offset a trade imbalance
of $2.4 billion, the Uganda office of the Washington-based
lender said today by e-mail from Kampala, the capital.  Uganda borders Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic
Republic of Congo and South Sudan. The nation earned $882
million from its exports to Sudan and the Democratic Republic of
Congo last year, equaling the total official development
assistance it got, the lender said.  The country, which is on a cusp of an oil boom, may grow
4.5 percent in the 12 months through June, from 3.4 percent a
year earlier, the World Bank said.  More rapid diversification of the economy and prudent use
of resources, including oil, will spur economic growth in the
medium term to between 7 percent and 8 percent or more, the bank
said.  London-based Tullow Oil Plc discovered commercially viable
deposits in the East African country in 2006. The company is
jointly developing the nation’s oilfields with China National
Offshore Oil Corp. and France’s Total SA, which says significant
production will start in 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
