Wema Bank Plc , a Nigerian lender,
dropped the most in more than eight years as some investors bet
that full-year earnings would be insufficient to sustain the
price.  The shares retreated 9.6 percent, the most since September
2004, to close at 1.70 naira in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial
capital. About 9.14 million securities traded, or 150 percent of
the three-month daily average volume, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The stock decline ended a 21-day record rally.  “Many investors are selling the bank’s shares and the
demand is no longer sufficient to hold the price at the previous
high level,”  David Adonri , chief executive officer of Lagos-
based Lambeth Trust and Investment Co., said by phone. “It is
not certain if the bank’s full-year result will be good enough
to sustain the bullish price.”  Nigerian banks are expected to release their full-year
results starting this month after the Central Bank of Nigeria
changed to a December common year-end for all the country’s
lenders as part of reforms.  Wema Bank posted a loss of 1.8 billion naira ($11.4
million) for the nine months through September compared with a
profit of 1.2 billion naira a year earlier, it said in a Jan. 4
statement on the Nigerian Stock Exchange website. Revenue rose
to 19.8 billion naira from 17.4 billion naira.  The stock has more than tripled this year, compared with a
19 percent rise in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
