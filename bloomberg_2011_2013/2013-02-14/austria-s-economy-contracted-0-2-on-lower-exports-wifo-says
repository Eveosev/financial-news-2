Austria’s economy shrank in the
fourth quarter as lower demand for goods in the euro area slowed
exports, government-backed Wifo economic research institute
said.  Fourth-quarter gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent from
the third quarter, when it rose 0.1 percent, Wifo said today in
an e-mailed statement. Exports declined 0.1 percent and consumer
demand also fell 0.1 percent after a stagnation in the third
quarter.  The economy in the Alpine republic rose 0.7 percent in 2012
based on today’s flash estimate, Wifo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
