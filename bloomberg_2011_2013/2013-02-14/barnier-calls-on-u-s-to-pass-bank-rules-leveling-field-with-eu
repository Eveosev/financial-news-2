Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial services chief, has called for a regulatory “level
playing field” for EU- and U.S.-based banks.  The EU and the U.S. are “in the finishing straight” of
rule-making to apply Basel bank capital rules to lenders,
according to an e-mailed statement from Barnier’s office. The
comments were released today after Barnier met with U.S. Federal
Reserve Governor  Daniel Tarullo  in Washington D.C.  Barnier and Tarullo agreed it was important to work
together to “ensure an effective, proportionate and coherent”
application of the measures, according to the statement.  The EU and U.S. have struggled to implement legislation to
apply the Basel rules, which were published in 2010 as part of
efforts to prevent any repeat of the financial crisis that
followed the collapse of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.   Both jurisdictions missed an international Jan. 1 deadline
to begin phasing in the rules.  “Mr. Tarullo confirmed that the U.S. will publish a final
text in the spring” to apply the Basel rules, according to the
statement. “They both judged it essential that this new
regulatory framework be put into effective application as soon
as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
