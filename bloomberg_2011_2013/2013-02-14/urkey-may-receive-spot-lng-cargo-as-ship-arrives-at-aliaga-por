Turkey’s port of Aliaga may receive
a spot cargo of liquefied natural gas today from the 151,000
cubic meter Gaselys, according to ship-tracking data.  The country’s EgeGaz LNG has a regasification terminal at
Aliaga. The Gaselys sailed from Egypt’s Idku LNG terminal where
it loaded its cargo, according to ship transmissions captured by
IHS Inc. on Bloomberg.  Turkey’s Botas International Ltd. has LNG supply contracts
with Nigeria and Algeria, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
