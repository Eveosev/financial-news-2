Teresa Heinz Kerry , the wife of
Secretary of State  John Kerry , is profiting from the sale of  HJ
Heinz Co.  to  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  and 3G Capital.  The $23 billion sale of Heinz valued the stock at $72.50 a
share, 20 percent higher than yesterday’s closing price of
$60.48.  Through three family trusts, Heinz Kerry, the widow of
Pennsylvania Republican Senator  John Heinz , owned more than $3
million in Heinz stock in 2011, according to a personal
financial disclosure report filed in August 2012 by her husband,
then a U.S. senator from Massachusetts. Kerry didn’t report any
holdings in the company.  Lawmakers provide estimates on the amount of their holdings
and their spouses’ investments in broad ranges. Kerry’s filings
indicate that his wife’s trusts held three stakes in Heinz, each
valued at more than $1 million.  Senator  Kay Hagan , a North Carolina Democrat, and eight
House members also owned Heinz stock, according to their
financial disclosure statements obtained by the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group. One of
the lawmakers, Republican Representative  Mike Fitzpatrick  of
Pennsylvania, bought between $1,000 and $15,000 of stock in
November 2011.  The biggest Heinz investor in Congress was Representative
 Dave Camp , a Michigan Republican and chairman of the tax-writing
House Ways and Means Committee. He reported holdings of between
$50,000 and $100,000. Freshman Republican  Keith Rothfus  valued
his Heinz stake at between $15,000 and $50,000, with his wife
owning an additional $50,000 and $100,000 of Heinz stock.  -- --Editors: Steven Komarow, Justin Blum  To contact the reporters on this story:
