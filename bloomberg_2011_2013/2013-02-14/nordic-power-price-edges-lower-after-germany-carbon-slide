Nordic electricity prices for month-
ahead and next-quarter delivery fell for the first time in three
days, tracking earlier declines in German prices.  The March contract slid 0.4 percent to 38.15 euros ($50.85)
a megawatt-hour as of 3:17 p.m. on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s
energy exchange in Oslo. The benchmark next-quarter contract
fell 0.8 percent to 36.55 euros.  German power for baseload delivery next quarter was little
changed after falling as much as 0.5 percent to 37.60 euros a
megawatt-hour, broker data compiled by Bloomberg show.  EON SE delayed the start of its 473-megawatt Oskarshamn-1
nuclear reactor in Sweden from March 1 to May 26 to modify
diesel generators and complete yearly maintenance, the German
utility said today in two separate filings with the Oslo-based
power exchange Nord Pool Spot AS. The Oskarshamn-2 and
Oskarshamn-3 reactors are operating normally, according to the
company’s website.  Flows on the 550-megawatt Fennoskan-1 cable that links
Finland and Sweden will be halted until May 1 following a
“probable cable fault,” Finnish grid operator Fingrid Oyj said
today in a filing to the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo. The
800-megawatt Fennoskan-2 cable is operating normally, according
to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
