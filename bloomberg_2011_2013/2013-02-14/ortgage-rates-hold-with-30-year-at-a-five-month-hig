U.S. mortgage rates held steady amid
rising demand for housing that’s pushing up prices.  The average  30-year  rate was 3.53 percent in the week ended
today, unchanged from the previous week and the highest level
since September, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac  said in a
statement. The average  15-year  rate held at 2.77 percent.  U.S. home  prices  are climbing as buyers compete for a
shrinking  supply  of properties for sale. The strengthening job
market and low mortgage rates are giving Americans incentives to
make a purchase.  “Affordability is fantastic right now,”  Brad Hunter ,
chief economist at Metrostudy, a real estate research firm, said
yesterday in a telephone interview. “A lot of people are coming
off the fence.”  Payrolls increased by 157,000 workers in January following
a revised 196,000 gain the prior month and a 247,000 jump in
November, Labor Department figures showed Feb. 1.  Home prices in 20 U.S. cities jumped 5.5 percent in the 12
months through November, the most in more than six years,
according to the S&P/Case-Shiller  index  released Jan. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
