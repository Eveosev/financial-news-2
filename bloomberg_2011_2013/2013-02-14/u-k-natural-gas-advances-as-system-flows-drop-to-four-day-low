U.K. natural gas for next-day
delivery climbed as flows into the delivery network dropped to a
four-day low.  Within-day and next-month contracts also advanced,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. System  supply
 declined to 300 million cubic meters a day, the least since Feb.
5 and compared with a 10-day average of 344 million, National
Grid Plc data show.  Gas for  tomorrow  gained as much as 1.4 percent to 68.95
pence a therm and was at 68.25 pence at 4:14 p.m. London time.
 Month-ahead gas  climbed 1.1 percent to 67.13 pence a therm.
That’s equivalent to $10.42 per million British thermal units
and compares with $3.18 per million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Demand  in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 313
million cubic meters, the least since Feb. 10, yet above the
seasonal normal of 309 million, National Grid data show. The
delivery  network  will contain 353 million cubic meters of gas at
the end of the period, little changed from the beginning, grid
data show.  Flows from  Norway , the U.K.’s biggest source of imported
gas, were at 96 million cubic meters a day versus a 10-day
average of 106 million, Gassco AS data show.  Gas accounted for 29 percent of power production at 4:10
p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 43 percent, nuclear 16
percent and wind 5.8 percent.  Wind energy output will peak at 2,104 megawatts tomorrow
after reaching 3,285 megawatts today, according to Bloomberg
calculations. It reached a  record  5,082 megawatts on Feb. 3,
grid data show.  Electricity  for tomorrow rose 0.5 percent to 49.50 pounds a
megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
