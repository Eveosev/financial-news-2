Three people died and seven are
trapped after a section of  Semirara Mining Corp .’s coal mine pit
in Antique province in central Philippines collapsed, prompting
the company to halt operations.  Three people were saved while search and rescue operations
continue for the seven, Semirara said in a stock exchange filing
today. “The company’s management is continuously monitoring the
situation in coordination with government authorities with the
end in view of resuming operations at the appropriate time,” it
said.  Semirara fell 7.7 percent at the noon trading break in
Manila, heading for the sharpest loss since Sept. 23, 2011. It
dropped as much as 15 percent after the news. Parent DMCI
Holdings Inc. fell 3.2 percent, the most in two months.  Semirara, which supplies coal from its mine in Antique, was
awarded government coal contracts in the provinces of Oriental
Mindoro and Sarangani, the company said in a stock exchange
filing on Feb. 12.  The government fined  Philex Mining Corp . 1 billion pesos
($25 million) after heavy rain caused a spill at its Padcal mine
in Benguet province, north of Manila, in August.  Police Chief Superintendent Agrimero Cruz today said rain
may have triggered a landslide in the mine. In January last
year, more than 30 people died after a landslide in a gold
mining community in Compostela Valley in Mindanao.  To contact the reporter on this story:
