Gold demand rose 3.8 percent in the
fourth quarter as Indian purchases jumped, narrowing the first
drop in annual usage in three years, the  World Gold Council 
said. India remained last year’s biggest buyer, ahead of China.  Global demand gained to 1,195.9 metric tons in the quarter,
the most ever for an October-to-December period, from 1,151.7
tons a year earlier, as Indian consumption surged 41 percent,
the London-based industry group said today in a report. Jewelry
usage rose 11 percent to the highest since the first quarter of
2011, leaving total demand for 2012 down 3.9 percent at 4,405.5
tons. That’s still 15 percent more than the five-year average.  Purchases in India, which the council had expected to be
replaced by China as the top buyer, rose toward year-end on
seasonal buying and expectations of higher import duties, it
said. While holdings in gold-backed  exchange-traded products 
reached a record in December as prices posted a 12th straight
annual gain, the metal failed to set an all-time high for the
first time since 2007. China’s economic growth accelerated for
the first time in two years in the fourth quarter.  “The real driver was the rise in jewelry, and within that
you saw India being key” in the fourth quarter,  Marcus Grubb ,
managing director of investment research at the council, said
yesterday by phone from London. “China’s economy is now re-
accelerating quite strongly into January and February. Both
Indian and Chinese demand will be higher in 2013.”  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,644.65 an ounce in
London yesterday, down 1.8 percent this year. Prices averaged a
record $1,717.86 in the fourth quarter, up 2.1 percent from a
year earlier and 3.9 percent higher than the third quarter. They
averaged an all-time high $1,669 in 2012, boosting the value of
last year’s demand to $236.4 billion, the most ever.  Jewelry Demand  Global jewelry demand rose to 525.3 tons in the latest
quarter, as purchases climbed 35 percent to 153 tons in India
and added 1 percent to 137 tons in China, the report showed.
That left the worldwide jewelry total down 3.2 percent at
1,908.1 tons last year.  Total consumer demand in India slipped 12 percent to 864.2
tons last year, partly as jewelers held a strike in March and
April to protest taxes on imports and as local prices surged to
a record. The government raised taxes on gold imports last month
to 6 percent from 4 percent.  While China’s usage fell 0.5 percent to 776.1 tons, the gap
of 88.1 tons between the two-biggest markets was the smallest
ever, Grubb said. The council said in November that China would
probably overtake India as the biggest buyer on an annual basis.  Central Banks  Central banks boosted purchases by 29 percent to 145 tons
in the fourth quarter, an eighth successive quarter of net
buying, the council said. Nations from Brazil to Russia added
534.6 tons to reserves last year, 17 percent more than in 2011
and the most since 1964, it estimates.  “We think that the current rate of net central bank
purchasing, driven by emerging countries, is likely to continue
to be very strong,” Grubb said, adding that the council doesn’t
have a forecast for 2013 buying yet. “This is very much due to
a desire to diversify away from over-reliance from the dollar
and the euro.”  Investment, including gold bars, coins and ETPs, dropped
8.3 percent to 424.7 tons in the three months through December
from a year earlier, the council said. Full-year investment slid
9.8 percent to 1,534.6 tons. Holdings in ETPs have declined 0.9
percent from the record 2,632.5 tons set Dec. 20, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Mine output rose 1.9 percent to 735.2 tons in the fourth
quarter and increased 0.4 percent to 2,847.7 tons for the full
year, the council said. Scrap supply was down 4.7 percent at
407.9 tons in the quarter and 2.6 percent lower at 1,625.6 tons
for the whole year, according to the report.  “Gold recycling seems to have plateaued,” Grubb said.
“Near-market stocks of recycled gold have been exhausted. The
only way you can tempt more recycling out of the hands of
existing owners of gold is to raise the price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
