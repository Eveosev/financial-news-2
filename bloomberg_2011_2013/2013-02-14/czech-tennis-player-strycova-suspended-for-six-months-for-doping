Czech tennis player Barbora
Zahlavova Strycova was suspended for six months for failing a
drug test in October during a tournament in Paris.  The 26-year-old, who is ranked 124th in the world by the
WTA tour, was found to have used sibutramine, a stimulant, the
International Tennis Federation said today in an e-mailed
statement. Strycova, a member of the Czech Fed Cup team, said
she didnâ€™t realize the drug was in a supplement, ACAI Berry
Thin, that she was taking.  Her suspension was backdated to Oct. 16, 2012 and will end
April 15, the ITF said. She also was disqualified from two
tournaments, forfeiting ranking points and prize money.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
