U.S. Bancorp ’s lawsuit against
Lightstone Group LLC over a $100 million guaranty triggered by
the bankruptcy of  Extended Stay  was revived by a New York state
appeals court.  The Manhattan court ruled today that U.S. Bancorp, a
trustee for senior debt holders in Extended Stay, has standing
to pursue its suit, disagreeing with state Supreme Court Justice
 Melvin Schweitzer , who dismissed the case in 2011.  U.S. Bancorp sought to be paid ahead of junior lenders to
the hotel firm out of a $100 million pot personally guaranteed
by Lightstone and its founder  David Lichtenstein . Junior lenders
have also claimed rights to the funds, according to the appeals
court’s decision.  “There are provisions in the various agreements, all of
which were executed on the same day, that are not fully
consistent with each other,” the appellate panel said in the
ruling.  Lightstone bought Charlotte, North Carolina-based Extended
Stay, which controlled a group of more than 600 hotels, in 2007.
The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009.  A group of investors including Centerbridge Partners LP,
acquired the company out of bankruptcy in 2010.  Senior debt holders, which were owed $4.1 billion, received
$3.9 billion from the sale, according to Schweitzer’s 2011
opinion. Junior debt holders, which were owed $3.3 billion,
received nothing, according to the opinion.  David Friedman , a lawyer representing Lightstone and
Lichtenstein, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment
on the ruling.  The case is U.S. Bank NA v. Lightstone Holdings LLC,
651951-2010, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
