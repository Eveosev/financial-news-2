Corn and soybean crops devastated by
the worst drought since the 1930s should recover this year,
lowering prices, said  Joe Glauber , chief economist for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.  With a return to normal yields, “a rebuilding of stocks
and lower commodity prices would be expected in the fall,”
Glauber said today at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing.
Wheat- and hay-producing areas remain in the grip of drought,
while conditions have improved in much of the Corn Belt states
further east, he said.  “Major questions related to persistent drought conditions
remain,” he said. “It’s still very, very early” in the year
for predictions.  Almost 56 percent of the contiguous 48 states were in
 drought  as of the week ended Feb. 12, up from 38 percent a year
earlier, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Dryness in the
nation’s main crop-growing regions sent  corn yields  to their
lowest since 1995 while ranchers slaughtered animals to cut
costs, shrinking the cattle herd to its smallest since 1952.  Farmers  will plant  96 million acres of corn in 2013, a 0.9
percent decline from last year, and 76 million acres of
soybeans, a 1.6 percent drop, the USDA said in a 10-year
forecast this week. Plantings of wheat, which requires less
rainfall, may increase 3.2 percent to 57.5 million acres.  Cattle Areas  Livestock producers, who thinned herds to avoid rising feed
costs, continue to experience hardships, Glauber said. About 69
percent of cattle-producing areas and 59 percent of hay acreage
remain in drought conditions, with rain needed to allow ranchers
to rebuild their operations.  “Cattle on the southern Plains are in a dry situation,”
Glauber told reporters after his testimony. “We are very
concerned.”  Domestic beef output will drop to an eight-year low in
2013, and per-capita supplies will be the smallest since at
least 1970, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. Cattle
futures in Chicago may rally to a record $1.3925 a pound this
year, up 7.6 percent from yesterday’s close, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  More than a fifth of all  U.S. counties  have already been
declared agricultural disaster areas because of drought,
according to the USDA. With claims still to be processed,
government-subsidized crop-insurance payments from companies
including  Ace Ltd.  and  Wells Fargo & Co.  for 2012 crop losses
have already surpassed  $14.2 billion , exceeding the 2011 record
of $10.84 billion, the USDA said today.  Indemnities may reach $16 billion,  then drop  to $10.1
billion for this year’s crops, according to a congressional
estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
