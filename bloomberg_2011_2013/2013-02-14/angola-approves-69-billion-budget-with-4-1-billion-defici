Angola, Africa’s second-biggest oil
producer, approved a state budget that forecasts a deficit while
doubling social spending from two years ago.  The government plans to spend $49.9 billion and collect
revenue of $45.8 billion, resulting in a $4.1 billion deficit,
according to budget documents. It expects to receive about $19
billion in loans and foreign aid, the documents show.  Angola is boosting social spending as it rebuilds from a
27-year civil war that ended in 2002. Oil dominates the economy,
accounting for more than 60 percent of domestic output and 97
percent of export earnings. Offshore fields operated by
companies including  Exxon Mobil Corp. ,  Chevron Corp. ,  BP Plc  and
 Total SA  pump about 1.8 million barrels of oil a day, second
only to Nigeria in Africa.  “The problem with increasing social spending is about the
institutional capacity to spend, in a correct and rational way,
all the money the government wants to put in these sectors,”
Manuel Alves de Rocha, an economist at the Catholic University
in Luanda, said by e-mail today. “It means nothing to increase
this part of the budget if the money goes to the pockets of
government officials.”  Angola ranked 157 of 176 countries on Transparency
International’s 2012 corruption perceptions  index , behind Yemen
and Kyrgyzstan. Angola’s life expectancy is 47 years, according
to the World Bank. The under-five mortality rate is the world’s
eighth-highest at 161 deaths per 1,000 children, and 54 percent
of the country lived on less than $1.25 a day in 2009, according
to the  United Nations Children’s Fund .  Social Spending  The budget is based on forecasts of a 7.1 percent growth in
the economy this year, inflation of 9 percent, an exchange rate
of 96.3 kwanzas to the dollar, and oil sales of 673 million
barrels at $96 each.  Angola’s economy expanded 7.4 percent last year and has
grown at an average pace of 9.2 percent over the past five
years, with non-oil output growing faster at 12 percent,
according to the budget.  About 34 percent of this year’s spending will be directed
at social sectors with education getting 8.9 percent, health 5.3
percent and social security 11 percent, according to government
documents. Oil taxes are due to contribute 3.3 trillion kwanzas
($34.4 billion) to revenue.  Reserve Cover  The government will tap foreign reserves, which reached $31
billion at the end of 2012, to help cover a budget deficit if
necessary, Central Bank Governor  Jose de Lima Massano , said
yesterday in an interview. Reserves doubled in the last three
years and now cover eight months of imports, he said.  The opposition parties of the former rebel Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, and its offshoot
Convergencia Ampla de Salvacao de Angola or Casa-CE, voted
against the budget. It passed with 155 in favor to 38 opposed,
with five abstentions from two smaller groups. The ruling
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, controls
175 seats in the 220-member parliament.  “The state budget approval is of capital importance for
party members, especially after voters in the Aug. 31 national
elections supported the party governance program,” Diogenes de
Oliveira, an MPLA lawmaker, said today in parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
