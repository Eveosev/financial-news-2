Newfield Exploration Co ., the oil
and natural gas producer that’s shifting its focus to U.S.
operations, fell the most in three months after saying
production may not grow this year.  The shares declined 5.6 percent to $28.11 at the close in
New York, the most since Oct. 24.  Newfield, based in The Woodlands, Texas, expects 2013
production of 44 million to 47 million barrels of oil
equivalent, according to a statement released yesterday after
the close of regular trading. The company estimated 2012
production at 47 million barrels equivalent, excluding assets
that have been sold.  The company also said it’s hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
to evaluate alternatives for its offshore oil and gas fields in
Malaysia and China. About 22 percent of Newfield’s production
last year -- the equivalent of 10.1 million barrels of oil --
came from the assets, and output is expected to drop 29 percent
to 7.2 million barrels equivalent in 2013.  That decline may hinder efforts to sell the units,
according to  Leo Mariani , an analyst with RBC Capital Markets in
Austin, Texas.  “The company may struggle to find a buyer given these
aren’t popular assets,” Mariani wrote in a note to clients.
“We do think this is a good strategic idea.”  Under Chief Executive Officer  Lee Boothby , Newfield has
sought to concentrate on domestic oil production since 2009. The
company’s U.S. production was 36.8 million barrels equivalent in
2012, and may grow to 57 million barrels equivalent in 2015.  Newfield has oil property in the Uinta Basin in Utah, the
Williston Basin in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford Shale in
Texas.  Newfield expects to report a net loss of about $1.2
billion, or $8.80 a share, for 2012, Steve Campbell, a company
spokesman, said yesterday in a telephone interview.  Newfield has fallen 29 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
