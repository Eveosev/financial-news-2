Ringgit forwards climbed to the
strongest level this month after Japan’s economy unexpectedly
shrank and the euro-area recession deepened, increasing the
appeal of Malaysian assets.  The Southeast Asian  economy grew  5.5 percent from a year
earlier in the fourth quarter, after expanding 5.2 percent in
the preceding three months, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before data due Feb. 20. Japan’s gross domestic product
contracted an annualized 0.4 percent in the fourth-quarter,
while the euro-area’s GDP fell 0.6 percent from previous three
months, according to official data released in Tokyo and
Luxembourg today.  “Malaysia’s resilient growth should also keep its currency
well-supported,” said Vishnu Varathan, an economist at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “Japan’s growth surprised on
the downside.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards appreciated 0.1
percent to 3.1519 per dollar as of 5:40 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur,
the highest level this month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts to buy or sell the ringgit in a year
traded at a 2 percent discount to the spot rate, which fell 0.1
percent to 3.0911, the data show. Non-deliverable forwards are
settled in dollars.  The ringgit earlier reached 3.0825 per dollar, the
strongest level since Jan. 31. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 15
basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 7.35 percent.  Germany, France  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted 0.4 percent
growth in Asia’s second-largest economy and a 0.4 percent
shrinkage in the euro area. Germany’s economy, the largest in
Europe, contracted 0.6 percent last quarter, and French GDP
dropped 0.3 percent.  Japan’s central bank kept its asset-purchase program
unchanged at 76 trillion yen today. All 20 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News predicted no additional easing would be
announced today. The BOJ last month pledged to begin open-ended
asset purchases in 2014 to stimulate the economy.  Malaysian government bonds retreated. The yield on the
3.418 percent government bonds maturing in August 2022 climbed
one basis point to 3.48 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
