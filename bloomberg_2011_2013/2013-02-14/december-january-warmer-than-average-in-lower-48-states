The months of December and January
were warmer than usual in the contiguous U.S., with an average
temperature 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.4 Celsius) above the norm,
the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  said.  The eastern half of the U.S. was warmest, while
temperatures were slightly lower than normal in the West and
Southwest, NOAA said today in its monthly climate report. The
two months ranked as the 18th-warmest December-January, while
the year from February 2012 through January was the warmest 12
months on record.  An “active storm pattern” in the U.S. East raised the
precipitation level for December-January to wetter than average
by 0.65 inch (1.7 centimeters), NOAA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
