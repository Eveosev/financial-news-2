With  AMC Networks Inc. ’s ability to
persuade cable- and satellite-TV companies to carry its channels
under threat, there’s never been a better time for the
controlling Dolan family to sell the business.  AMC owns four channels, including a namesake brand that
airs “Mad Men” and “The Walking Dead,” the top-rated U.S.
drama in the most-coveted demographic. Dish Network Corp.
dropped the networks for almost four months in 2012, and Time
Warner Cable Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Glenn Britt  has said
inclusion in channel lineups isn’t a “birthright.” Faced with
the possibility AMC’s reach may shrink, analysts see its shares
 slumping  1 percent in the next year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Bundled with the multitude of higher-rated channels owned
by a larger media company, AMC’s properties might stand a better
shot in fee negotiations with distributors. Comcast Corp., News
Corp. and CBS Corp. are likely buyers due to AMC’s record of
developing hit shows, BTIG LLC said. Comcast, which is acquiring
the rest of NBC Universal, would be interested in AMC at the
right price, according to a person familiar with the matter. The
second-highest price-earnings ratio among peers means the time
for AMC’s owners to sell is now, CRT Capital Group LLC said.  “The Dolan family realizes that AMC’s value is peaking,”
 Lance Vitanza , a Stamford, Connecticut-based analyst at CRT
Capital, said in a telephone interview. “If I’m Jimmy Dolan,
there’s never been a better time for me to sell AMC Networks.”  Dolan Family  Jim Dolan  is the CEO of Cablevision Systems Corp., which
spun off AMC in 2011. The Dolan family still controls the voting
rights for the $4.2 billion company, and Jim Dolan is a board
member along with his father, AMC Chairman  Charles Dolan .  Georgia Juvelis , a spokeswoman for New York-based AMC, said
the company doesn’t comment on speculation.  John Demming , a
spokesman for Philadelphia-based Comcast, also declined to
comment, as did News Corp.’s  Nathaniel Brown  and CBS’s  Dana McClintock . The latter two companies are based in New York.  Besides its namesake channel, AMC owns IFC, which features
movies and original TV programs; the Sundance Channel, which
airs independent films; and the female-focused WE tv. Its
biggest ratings success is “The Walking Dead,” a zombie series
that had 12.3 million total  viewers  for its Feb. 10 midseason
premiere, according to data compiled by Nielsen Holdings NV. The
show has averaged 6.8 million viewers in the 18-to-49
demographic this season, the highest of any drama.  Series Ending  AMC  also airs “Breaking Bad,” which concludes this year,
and “Mad Men,” which has two more seasons, with the next one
starting in April. The impending conclusions of those two shows
may spur a deal, Vitanza said.  While  AMC  owns “The Walking Dead” and can profit from
online downloads, DVDs and syndication, it doesn’t have the same
control over “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad.” Lions Gate
Entertainment Corp. of Santa Monica, California, owns and
produces “Man Men,” while “Breaking Bad” belongs to Tokyo-
based Sony Corp.  Shares of AMC  surged  31 percent through yesterday to a
record $59.76 since the distribution dispute with Dish was
resolved in October, bringing their gain since trading  began  in
June 2011 to 68 percent. Today, the stock lost 0.5 percent.  The stock fetched 28.6 times reported profit as of
yesterday, the second-highest valuation among U.S. broadcasting
and entertainment companies trading for more than $1 billion,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Its enterprise value was 13.4
times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, compared with 11.5 at News Corp. and 9.4 at CBS.  Downside Risk  At this valuation, “the risks are more to the downside,”
Vitanza said.  Comcast, News Corp. and CBS are all possible buyers of AMC,
said  Rich Greenfield , a New York-based analyst at BTIG. Comcast
would be interested at the right price even after agreeing this
week to buy out General Electric Co.’s NBC Universal stake for
$16.7 billion, said a person familiar with Comcast’s plans, who
asked not to be named because the matter is private. NBC
Universal’s cable properties include USA Networks, MSNBC and
Bravo.  Even though a buyer may not gain long-term benefits from
“Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad,” AMC’s success cultivating
those series proves the  value  of the company, Greenfield said.
Both programs and their actors have won accolades including Emmy
awards and Golden Globes.  “Lots of companies would love to have a network with a
strong brand for iconic programming,” Greenfield said in a
phone interview. “Hits beget hits. Deeper programming money
would lead to huge opportunities.”  Low Ratings  The success of “The Walking Dead” hasn’t translated into
a broad audience for all of AMC’s properties.  AMC  was the 14th-
most-watched cable channel during prime time this year as of
Feb. 10, data compiled by Nielsen show. IFC and WE tv weren’t
among the top 35, and Sundance wasn’t rated.  A buyer of the parent company could completely redo the
lower-rated channels, using the existing distribution agreements
to help guarantee delivery of the new programming. Al Jazeera
did just that this year, buying Current TV with a plan to
convert it into an American affiliate of the Qatar-based news
channel.  A larger buyer would also have the opportunity to boost the
rate  AMC  charges for channels, Greenfield said. The channel
known as AMC brings in 29 cents a month on average for each of
the 99.6 million people who have access to it, according to
estimates for 2013 from SNL Kagan. IFC, Sundance and WE tv
charge 21 cents, 16 cents, and 12 cents, respectively. That
compares with 51 cents for News Corp.’s FX Network, 64 cents for
Comcast’s USA Network, and $5.51 for Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN.  Negotiating Leverage  AMC’s fees lag behind in part because it’s locked into
contracts with pay-TV providers that were signed before ratings
for “The Walking Dead” soared, Greenfield said.  An acquisition would be appealing for Comcast, which is
also the biggest U.S. cable company, or News Corp. because
they’ll be able to guarantee the channels get distribution by
tying them to their more popular networks when contracts are
renewed, said Gamco Investors Inc.’s  Chris Marangi . The
investment firm, which has $36 billion in assets,  owns  more than
4 million AMC shares.  Time Warner Cable, the second-largest U.S. cable operator,
hasn’t re-signed WE tv and IFC to a new deal, according to a
person familiar with the negotiations, who asked not to be
identified because the talks are private. Both are in jeopardy
of being dropped if a deal isn’t reached, the person said.  “There are meaningful synergies to being a part of a
larger network group,” Marangi, a Rye, New York-based money
manager, said in a phone interview. “You could see a deal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
