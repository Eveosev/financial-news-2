The 10 largest investment banks
including Barclays Plc,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and Deutsche
Bank AG reduced the number of front-office jobs by 12 percent in
2012, according to analytics firm Coalition.  The banking and trading positions, which excludes
administration staff, declined to 54,448 in 2012 from 61,559 in
2011 with the deepest cuts in Asia-Pacific and Europe, London-
based Coalition said in a statement today.  “Despite having fewer front office producers than the
Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa cut significantly
harder for the second year in a row,” Coalition said in the
statement. A “significant acceleration” also occurred in the
Asia-Pacific region, it said.  Global financial firms announced cuts of around 108,733
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as they
grapple with a weakened euro-area economy and increased pressure
from regulators to raise more capital and trim compensation. The
International Monetary Fund said in January it expects the euro-
area economy to shrink for a second year in 2013 as governments
struggle to contain the fiscal crisis. The global economy may
expand 3.5 percent this year, less than the 3.6 percent
projected in October, the Washington-based fund said.  Barclays Plc  said this week it plans to cut 1,800 positions
or 7.5 percent of employees at its investment bank, which has
businesses in Hong Kong, London and New York.  Morgan Stanley 
said it was eliminating 1,700 jobs last month as it pursues $1.6
billion of annual savings during the next two years. Morgan
Stanley, based in New York cut about 4,500 jobs in 2012.  Most cuts were made in equities with a 14 percent decline,
followed by fixed-income, currencies and commodities at 11
percent, Coalition said.  The Coalition Index tracks the performance of the 10
largest investment banks globally including Goldman Sachs,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc.
and UBS AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
