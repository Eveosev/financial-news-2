DSV A/S  rose the most in almost two
months in Copenhagen trading after Danske Bank A/S said the
Nordic region’s biggest trucking company is winning market
share.  DSV rose as much as 2.3 percent, the most since Dec. 20.
The stock advanced 0.7 percent to 143.50 kroner at 1:59 p.m. in
the Danish capital with trading volume at 161 percent of the
three-month daily average.  DSV, which is due to publish earnings on Feb. 20, will
report a 7.3 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings before
interest and tax, according to the average estimate in a
Bloomberg  survey  of nine analysts. Danske said today it expects
the Broendby, Denmark-based trucker to beat analyst estimates
and repeated a recommendation that investors buy the share.  “Most customers continued the de-stocking trend during the
quarter, which reduced volumes in the market,” Danske said.
“However, DSV was able to capture market share and we expect
positive year-on-year volume growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
