VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  is more
susceptible than ever to a private-equity takeover after
dismissing its chief executive officer and declining more this
year than almost every other large U.S. stock.  The company presents a bargain after  falling more  than all
 Russell 1000 Index (RIY)  stocks but five in 2013, fueled by a
disappointing earnings projection that prompted a single-day
slump of 43 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The shares trimmed their loss on March 12, rising 6 percent
after CEO Douglas Bergeron was ousted, which Raymond James
Financial Inc. said removed a potential obstacle to a deal.  Wedbush Inc. says VeriFone’s cash production makes it an
alluring target for private-equity firms, which use the money
generated by acquired companies to pay off the debt that funded
the transaction. VeriFone’s stock drop means its valuation
relative to free cash flow is two-thirds cheaper than Ingenico,
a rival maker of credit-card terminals, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “VeriFone has fairly stable cash flows, and private equity
could see value in buying VeriFone and cleaning up all the
mistakes,”  Gil Luria , an analyst at Wedbush in Los Angeles,
said in a telephone interview. “You could fix the business and
have it grow at industry rates.”  Andy Payment, a spokesman for San Jose, California-based
VeriFone, declined to comment when asked about the company’s
takeover prospects, citing a policy of not responding to
speculation.  Stock Plunges  VeriFone’s market value has shrunk to $2.2 billion after
the company’s  stock  retreated 30 percent in 2013, closing last
week at $20.68. That’s near the 32-month low of $18.24 reached
on Feb. 21 after VeriFone  said  earnings this quarter will be 45
cents to 50 cents a share, trailing the average of analysts’
estimates of 80 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Some of the declines could be due to VeriFone’s failure to
update its products in markets outside the U.S., and that could
be rectified in the next several quarters, said Wayne Johnson,
an Atlanta-based analyst at Raymond James. Also, product lines
acquired when VeriFone bought Hypercom and Point are dragging
down the company’s financial performance and should be
eliminated or restructured, Luria said.  The company’s main  business  is providing in-store terminals
that process credit- and debit-card payments. In recent years,
VeriFone’s hold on the card-terminals market has been threatened
by newcomers like Square Inc., EBay Inc.’s PayPal, Intuit Inc.,
Groupon Inc. and Bank of America Corp.  Services Expansion  SunTrust Banks Inc.’s Andrew Jeffrey said a private-equity
buyer could accelerate VeriFone’s expansion into services such
as providing security for transactions. VeriFone aims to boost
that segment of its business, which  made up  28 percent of sales
in fiscal 2012 and 21 percent in 2011.  “It’s certainly easier to make that kind of a big
transition as a private company,” Jeffrey, an analyst at
SunTrust in San Francisco, said in a phone interview. “It makes
a lot of sense long term.”  Bergeron made the same point in a March 11 interview.  “In retrospect, it’s a very hard transformation to do
cleanly as a public company,” he said.  He had been VeriFone’s CEO since 2002, and helped take the
company -- which had been owned by private-equity firm Gores
Technology Group -- public in 2005. In addition to surrendering
the CEO  role  last month, Bergeron quit VeriFone’s board.
Chairman Richard McGinn was named interim CEO.  More Open  His departure could make the company more open to a
 takeover , Johnson of Raymond James said.  “Bergeron may not have been that receptive to a take-out
offer at these levels,” Johnson said in a phone interview. “A
barrier has been removed.”  Bergeron worked at Gores before becoming CEO of VeriFone.
He may eventually go back into private equity, Bergeron said in
the March 11 interview.  Private-equity suitors could get into the payment-terminal
business relatively cheaply via VeriFone. Its shares traded for
14.8 times  free cash flow  at the end of last week, or 68 percent
less than Paris-based  Ingenico (ING) ’s multiple of 45.6, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Among transaction management systems
companies trading for more than $500 million, the median
multiple was 18.2, the data show.  Today, VeriFone shares rose 2.6 percent to $21.21, the
 fourth-biggest  gain in the Standard & Poor’s MidCap 400 Index.  Cash Flow  Even though VeriFone forecast less fiscal second-quarter
earnings than analysts projected, the company said on March 5
that free cash flow this year will be $170 million to $190
million, up from $154.8 million  in fiscal 2012 .  “Private-equity firms like attractive cash-flow yields,”
Meghna Ladha, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group LLP,
said in a phone interview. “The business is fundamentally a
good business, it was just an execution issue. I don’t see why
it can’t be fixed.”  To be sure, potential acquirers may be deterred from buying
VeriFone because it isn’t performing well, Jeffrey said.  “It’s easier to buy a company that’s operating well, but
is undervalued, than one that has a lot of uncertainty,” he
said.  The size of VeriFone’s  retreat  -- its shares are down 64
percent from a March 2011 peak of $56.84 -- could mollify any
concerns, Northcoast Research Holdings LLC’s Keith Housum said.  “I completely think that VeriFone is a company that could
be bought,” Housum, an analyst at Cleveland-based Northcoast,
said in a phone interview. “Whenever you have a company with a
significant value decline, the vultures start circling.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
