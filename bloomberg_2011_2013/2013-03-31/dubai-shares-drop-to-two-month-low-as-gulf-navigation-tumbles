Dubai’s  benchmark stock index 
dropped to the lowest level in two months amid speculation gains
this quarter were overdone.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, declined 1.7 percent, trimming its quarterly surge
to 37 percent.  Gulf Navigation Holding (GULFNAV) , which specializes in
shipping oil and gas, plunged the most since March last year
after its loss widened. The stock was  the most traded  on the  DFM
General Index (DFMGI) , which retreated 0.9 percent to 1,829.24, the
lowest close since Jan. 28. Egypt’s measure fell for the first
time in three days.  The drop pared the DFM’s gains this quarter to 13 percent,
the biggest such increase in a year and the third-strongest
performance among seven Persian Gulf benchmark indexes.
Seventeen stocks declined today, four gained and 10 were
unchanged.  Drake & Scull International (DSI)  lost the most since March
5 after the board of the supplier of engineering services to the
 construction industry  recommended not paying a dividend.  The market is undergoing a “correction,” said Nabil Farhat, partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. Gulf
Navigation also declined after saying the shipping industry
“will continue to suffer” this year, he said.  The company posted a 147.8 million dirham-loss ($40
million) in 2012 compared with 72.7 million dirhams a year
earlier. EFG-Hermes Holding SAE forecast a loss of 23 million
dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares
tumbled 8.2 percent to 22.4 fils. About 28 million shares traded
today, double the three-month daily average, the data show.  Emaar, which has the heaviest weighting on the index,  fell
to 5.12 dirhams. Drake & Scull slid 1.9 percent to 73 fils.
There are 100 fils to the dirham.  Elsewhere in the region,  Saudi Arabia ’s Tadawul All Share
Index lost 0.5 percent. Oman’s measure slid 1 percent and
Qatar’s QE Index fell 0.1 percent. Abu Dhabi’s measure rose 0.3
percent, while Kuwait’s index was little changed. Egypt’s  EGX 30
Index (EGX30)  lost 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
