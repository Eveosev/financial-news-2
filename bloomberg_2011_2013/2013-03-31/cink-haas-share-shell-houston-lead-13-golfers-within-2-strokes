Stewart Cink and Bill Haas share
the lead with four golfers one stroke back going into the final
round of the PGA Tour’s Shell Houston Open.  Cink hit a 4-under 68 yesterday and Haas carded a 5-under
67 for an 11-under 205 after 54 holes at Redstone Golf Club in
Humble, Texas.  Following the two U.S. leaders by one stroke are Steve
Wheatcroft, Ben Crane, Jason Kokrak and D.A Points. Nine other
players are two strokes off the lead.  “Tomorrow is a great learning opportunity for me to get
out there and be nervous and perform and try to stay in the
moment and let it happen,” Cink said yesterday. “I can’t
wait.”  Cink is going after his seventh tour win.  “I definitely will not be ignoring the fact that I’ll feel
a little bit nervous tomorrow,” Cink said. “But that’s just
natural human behavior and I’m looking forward to it. To get
back in the hunt is what you play golf for when you’re out on
the PGA Tour.”  Haas made seven birdies over his final 13 holes.  “Tomorrow you’re going to have to play very well,” Haas
said. “You can’t just hang on and hope everybody else will fall
back.”  Tied at 9-under 207 are Henrik Stenson, Cameron Tringale,
Louis Oosthuizen, Keegan Bradley, Angel Cabrera, Bud Cauley,
Kevin Chappell, Billy Horschel and Lee Westwood.  Phil Mickelson hit a 67 to end the day at 6-under 210,
along with five other golfers.  “I feel like I’ve got a low round in me tomorrow,”
Mickelson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
