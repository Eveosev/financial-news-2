Egyptian policemen working at Borg
El-Arab international airport in Alexandria destroyed airport
property including arrival and departure halls while protesting
for higher pay, state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  Police officers have destroyed cars owned by airport
officials, smashed glass facades of their offices and cut
Internet and electricity cables, causing an estimated loss of
1.5 million Egyptian pounds, MENA said, citing Hany Eqab,
airport manager. Violent clashes erupted between police and
employees, MENA said.  Air traffic halted at the airport as a result of the
strike. Hundreds of lower-ranked police personnel staged
protests in cities across the country, demonstrating against low
pay and demanding the interior minister be dismissed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
