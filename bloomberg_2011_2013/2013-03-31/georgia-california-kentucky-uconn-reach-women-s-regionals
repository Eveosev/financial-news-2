The  University of Georgia  advanced
to the round of eight after eliminating  Stanford University , the
first top seed to be ousted in the national women’s college
basketball tournament.  Fourth-seeded Georgia topped Stanford 61-59 while No. 2
California beat No. 6 LSU 74-63 in the Spokane region last night;
and No. 2 Kentucky defeated sixth-seeded Delaware 69-62 and top-
seeded  Connecticut  beat No. 4 Maryland in the Bridgeport region.  In today’s games for the remaining 16 schools, it’s top-
seeded Baylor and No. 5 Louisville and No. 6 Oklahoma against
second-seeded Tennessee in the Oklahoma City region; and No. 1
Notre Dame and No. 12 Kansas and sixth-seeded Nebraska against
second-seeded Duke in the Norfolk region.  Jasmine Hassell scored six of her 13 points in the final 3
minutes to give  Georgia  a trip to the regional finals of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament for the
first time since 2004.  Jasmine James, who led Georgia (28-6) with 16 points, hit a
pair of free throws with 23.5 seconds left that gave the Lady
Bulldogs a 60-56 lead.  Chiney Ogwumike led Stanford (33-3) with 26 points.  Connecticut will play Kentucky tomorrow in the Bridgeport
regional final, and Georgia will face California tomorrow in the
Spokane regional final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
