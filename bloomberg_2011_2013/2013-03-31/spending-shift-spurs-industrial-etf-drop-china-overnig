The worst performing Chinese
exchange-traded funds in the U.S. this year are those focused on
infrastructure and industrial stocks as the government shifts
away from driving growth through public spending.  The EGShares China Infrastructure Index Fund (CHXX)  has handed
investors an 11 percent loss in 2013, while the  Global X China
Industrials ETF (CHII)  dropped 9 percent, exceeding the average 3.3
percent slide in all U.S.-listed Chinese ETFs, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-
traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. slumped 7 percent in the three
months to March 31, its worst first quarter since 2008.  China , which installed new leaders last month, is looking
to reorient the world’s second-largest economy toward consumer
demand and away from a focus on public spending and
infrastructure building. Industrial output had the weakest start
to a year since 2009, while Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. and Aluminum
Corp. of China were among the 10  biggest decliners  on the
Bloomberg China-US gauge last quarter.  “Most people accept that the structure of the Chinese
economy needs to change over time, which means less
infrastructure and less construction at the margin,” Tony Hann,
who oversees $400 million of assets as head of emerging-market
equities at Blackfriars Asset Management Ltd., said by phone
from London March 28. “So you need to adjust your earnings
expectations for those infrastructure companies as analysts are
cutting their growth forecasts.”  ‘Unsustainable’ Model  Former Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in his final annual report
delivered March 5 that China’s growth model was
“unsustainable” and that the nation needed to take “expanding
domestic demand as our long-term strategy for economic
development.” New Premier Li Keqiang said last month that
growth, which averaged 10.4 percent a year between 2001 and
2011, must be maintained at an average 7.5 percent through 2020.  Yanzhou Coal, China’s fourth-largest producer of the fuel,
sank 20 percent in the three months to March 31 to $13.69, the
biggest drop in three quarters. The company’s 2012 net income
fell 35 percent to 5.52 billion yuan ($890 million), according
to a statement March 22. Of 32 analysts that cover Yanzhou’s
Hong Kong stock on Bloomberg, 50 percent rate it sell.  Aluminum Corp., the country’s China’s biggest producer of
the light metal, plunged 18 percent last quarter to $9.73. The
company, known as Chalco, had a net loss of 8.23 billion  yuan  in
2012, it said March 27. About 82 percent of analysts that cover
Chalco’s Hong Kong shares rate them sell.  Banking Curbs  China, which tightened curbs on the  property market  March
1, told banks March 28 to limit investments of client money in
debt that isn’t publicly traded to 35 percent of funds raised
from the sale of wealth-management products in a bid to cut
violations of lending restrictions. The products may have
climbed to 13 trillion yuan ($2.1 trillion) at the end of 2012,
from 8.5 trillion yuan in 2011, according to  Fitch Ratings .  Chinese U.S.-traded property stocks fell March 28 on
concern the restrictions will reduce bank lending to the sector.
U.S. markets were closed for a holiday March 29.  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) , a real estate agency based in
Beijing, plunged 3.5 percent to $4.65, the steepest slump since
March 13.  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , the Beijing-based owner of
China’s biggest property information website, slid 3 percent,
the most in two weeks, to $26.21.  “These funding curbs may be more important than previous
curbs on the property sector, if the money really isn’t
available that’s when demand starts to fall apart,”  Michael Shaoul , the chairman of Marketfield Asset Management LLC, which
oversees more than $6 billion, said by phone in  New York  March
28. “At some point in 2013 we’ll exceed the lows of 2012,” he
said, referring to Chinese stock indexes.  S&P Jumps  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., slipped 1.1 percent to $36.93
in New York March 28, bringing its decline last quarter to 8.7
percent. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added 0.4 percent to
1,569.19, lifting its 2013 jump to 10 percent.  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (981) , a circuit
foundry known as SMIC, tumbled 4.3 percent to $2.92 March 28,
sliding the most since Feb. 19.  China Life Insurance Co. (LFC) , the country’s biggest insurer,
sank 3.8 percent to $39.42 in New York, the lowest close since
July 12. Its American depositary receipts have lost 21 percent
this year.  The company, based in Beijing, said 2012 net income
declined 40 percent to 11.06 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) from a
year earlier, according to its statement March 28. Impairment
losses from equity investments jumped 140 percent to 31.1
billion yuan last year, China Life said.  Sinking Suntech  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) , an online fashion discounter based
in Guangzhou, jumped 70 percent last quarter to $30.37, leading
gainers on the China-US gauge.  Suntech Power Holdings Co., the world’s biggest solar-panel
maker in 2011, posted the steepest slide on the Bloomberg China-
US gauge last quarter, tumbling 75 percent to a record-low 39
cents in New York.  The company, based in Wuxi, China, said March 21 that a
local court had accepted a petition putting Wuxi Suntech Power
Co., its main operating subsidiary, into insolvency, after
defaulting on $541 million of bonds due March 15.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng  China Enterprises Index dropped 1.3
percent to 10,896.22 March 28, retreating from a two-week high.
The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares was
little changed at 2,236.62 March 29. The measure has lost 1.4
percent this year, while the Hang Seng is down 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
