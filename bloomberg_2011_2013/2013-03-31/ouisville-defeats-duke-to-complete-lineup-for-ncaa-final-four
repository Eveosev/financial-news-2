The University of Louisville
defeated Duke University 85-63 to complete the Final Four lineup
in college basketball’s national men’s championship.  Louisville will play Wichita State on April 6 in Atlanta
for a place in the title game at the Georgia Dome two days
later.  Syracuse faces  Michigan  in the other national semifinal.
The Wolverines today routed Florida 79-59 to reach the Final
Four at the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament
for the first time since 1993.  Louisville is the only one of the four regional top seeds
to reach the Final Four.  The Cardinals won the Midwest regional final after guard
Kevin Ware broke his right leg during the first half of the game
against the Blue Devils, an injury that left his coach and
teammates in tears.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
