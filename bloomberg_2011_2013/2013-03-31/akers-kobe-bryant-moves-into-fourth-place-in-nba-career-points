Los Angeles Lakers  Kobe Bryant 
passed Wilt Chamberlain to claim fourth place in the National
Basketball Association’s all-time scoring list.  Bryant’s field goal with seven minutes, 54 seconds left in
the second quarter against the Sacramento Kings gave him 31,421
career points. Chamberlain has 31,419 total points.  Bryant needs more than 800 points to reach third-place
 Michael Jordan , who ended his career with 32,292 points.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  is first with 38,387 points and Karl Malone is
second with 36,928 points.  Bryant, 34, said he is more interested in a sixth
championship than moving up the points list.  “I’m not asking for too much,” he told reporters. “Just
give me a sixth ring.”  Bryant had 19 points in the Lakers’ 103-98 win against the
Kings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
