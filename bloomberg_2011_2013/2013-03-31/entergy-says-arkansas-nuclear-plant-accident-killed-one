Entergy Corp. (ETR)  said that one person
was killed and three were injured at its  Arkansas  One nuclear
plant as equipment was being moved today on the non-nuclear side
of the facility.  Arkansas One is in an “unusual event classification”
after the industrial accident, which is the lowest of four
federal emergency classifications at nuclear plants, Terry Young, a spokesman at the headquarters of Entergy’s nuclear
division in Jackson,  Mississippi , said by telephone. “It was
not related to the side of the plant the reactor was on.”  The accident occurred at about 7:45 a.m. local time after
an old generator stator, or cylindrical shaft, was being removed
from the turbine building during a planned refueling and
maintenance outage at Unit 1, Young said.  The three injured people were transported to the local
hospital and then transferred to a regional hospital in
Russellville, Arkansas, Chris Meyer, section chief for Arkansas
Department of Health’s nuclear response program, said in a
telephone interview. There is no radiation associated with the
accident, Meyer said. “Unfortunately, we have no additional
information to share at this time regarding the individuals
involved,” Young said.  The second  995-megawatt reactor  at the site, about 65 miles
(105 kilometers) northwest of  Little Rock , shut down
automatically after the incidents and both units are in stable
condition, the company said in an emailed statement. Unit 1 can
generate 843 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
