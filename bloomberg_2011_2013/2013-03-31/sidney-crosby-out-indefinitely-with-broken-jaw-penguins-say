Sidney Crosby , who has collected a
National Hockey League-high 56 points this season while leading
the  Pittsburgh Penguins  to the league’s best record, is out
indefinitely with a broken jaw.  Crosby had surgery after being struck in the mouth by a
puck in the Penguins’ 2-0 win over the  New York  Islanders two
days ago. He also had dental work -- having lost a few teeth --
and will have more done later in the week, the Penguins said.  “The whole injury could have been a lot worse,” Penguins
General Manager Ray Shero was quoted as saying on the team’s
website. “When you get hit in the mouth like that on a
deflected puck. Hopefully, everything is OK. He didn’t get hit
in the eye. The jaw can be repaired.”  Shero said Crosby will be monitored over the next several
days for signs of concussion-like symptoms.  “Over the next few days we’ll see how things go and get
some sort of time frame on it at some point,” Shero said about
Crosby’s status. Crosby has 15 goals and a league-leading 41
assists in 36 games this season.  Pittsburgh has an NHL-best 28-8-0 record and is two games
shy of tying its own league record of 17 straight wins. The
Penguins next play tomorrow, at home against the  Buffalo Sabres .  To contact the reporter on this story:
