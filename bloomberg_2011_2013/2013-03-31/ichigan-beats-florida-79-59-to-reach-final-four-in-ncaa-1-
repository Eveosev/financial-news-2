The  University of Michigan  defeated
the University of Florida 79-59 to win the South regional final
in college basketball’s national men’s championship.  Nik Stauskas scored 22 points to lead  Michigan , which
jumped out to a 13-0 lead and never let Florida get within 11
points in Arlington, Texas. Stauskas hit all six of his 3-point
attempts.  The Wolverines advanced to the Final Four in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament for the first time
since 1993, when they were runner-up to  North Carolina . Michigan
won its only national title in 1989.  The Gators were seeking to reach the national semifinals
for the first time since 2007, when they successfully defended
the NCAA title they won for a first time the year before.  Also today, second-seeded Duke will vie with Louisville,
the only remaining regional top seed, in the Midwest final.  Fourth-seeded Syracuse yesterday won the East region final
and ninth-seeded Wichita State won the West title game to
advance to the Final Four.  The national semifinals will be played April 6 in Atlanta
with the championship game two days later.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
