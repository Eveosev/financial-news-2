The advance that pushed the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  to a record left companies trading closer to
analyst price estimates than any time in at least seven years.  Shares in the index are 5 percent away from analysts’ mean
forecasts after the benchmark gauge rallied 10 percent in the
first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg starting
in 2006. That’s the smallest difference ever for the median
stock and compares with the historical average of 14 percent.  Bulls say the narrowing spread shows securities firms were
caught off guard by the rally and that equities will climb as
they boost predictions. Bears say the slowness of analysts to
respond means stocks have gotten so far ahead of themselves that
even market optimists are uncomfortable with the increase, which
has added more than  $10 trillion  to values since 2009.  “The market has moved so fast, it hasn’t given the
analysts time to re-evaluate things,”  Malcolm Polley , who
manages $1.1 billion as chief investment officer at Stewart
Capital Advisors LLC in  Indiana ,  Pennsylvania , said in a March
26 phone interview. “As we just finished earnings season and
we’re winding down the first quarter, analysts will begin the
process of reassessing. My sense is we’re looking for better
economic and corporate things than we’re seeing today.”  The S&P 500  rose  0.8 percent to 1,569.19 last week, passing
the previous all-time high of 1,565.15 from October 2007, after
better-than-estimated durable goods orders and the biggest
increase in home prices in almost seven years. Stocks have
gained 10 percent in 2013, compared with increases of 4 percent
in the dollar, 0.6 percent in commodities and 0.6 percent gain
in global bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 S&P 500  fell 0.5 percent to 1,562.17 today.  Negative Spread  Stocks from  Western Digital Corp. (WDC)  to PG&E Corp. are closing
in on average forecasts, derived by taking the mean of all price
estimates for individual companies among securities firms
tracked by Bloomberg. A total of 401 are trading either within
the historic average of 14 percent or above price estimates,
projections show. Should every one of them reach the predicted
level, the S&P 500 would surpass 1,680, according to market-
weighted data.  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  and Mattel Inc. are among 134
companies that have already surpassed the average projection,
the most since at least 2006. The last time there were more than
100 companies trading above targets was in 2009, when the S&P
500 rose 24 percent. On average, companies that climbed above
analyst forecasts since 2006 rose another 9.6 percent in the
next 12 months, twice as much as the rest of the market, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Catching Up  “The market has gotten it right and analysts have been a
bit tardy,” Johannes Jooste, who helps oversee more than $1.76
trillion in client assets at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management in
 London , said in an interview on March 27. “Their fear of
systemic risk is still excessive.”  Concern Europe’s debt crisis is reviving has sent American
equities to their biggest single-day decline in 2013. The S&P
500 slumped 1.8 percent on Feb. 25 after Italian elections
produced inconclusive results. It dropped 0.6 percent on March
18 after European leaders imposed a tax on Cyprus bank deposits
as part of a bailout agreement.  Spreads between stocks and price projections have narrowed
as analysts cut forecasts for S&P 500 earnings. They predict
profits among companies in the benchmark gauge will fall 1.8
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, compared with
estimates for a 1.2 percent gain at the start of the year. Five
companies  issued  earnings forecasts below analyst estimates last
month for each that predicted results above the average
projection, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Earnings Estimates  “The fundamentals are not necessarily dramatically better
and therefore you may be paying a pretty full price” for
stocks, Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than $20 billion as
chief investment strategist at the private-banking unit of
KeyCorp in  Cleveland , said in a March 27 phone interview. “The
analysts have less to go on.”  Shares have  surged 132 percent  since March 9, 2009, the
biggest  bull market  since the eight-year advance in which the
benchmark index added 302 percent through 1998. They have
skirted bear markets twice, falling 16 percent over two months
in 2010 and 19 percent between May and October of 2011.  “A lot of people felt like we were going to muddle through
the first half, so when they set their targets, that’s what they
had in mind,”  Walter Todd , who oversees about $940 million as
chief investment officer of Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in
Greenwood,  South Carolina , said in a March 28 telephone
interview. “The consequence of that is we’re getting to these
targets set for the year much quicker.”  Dow Record  The spread between analyst forecasts and stock prices is
less than half what it was when the S&P 500 last peaked in
October 2007. Average estimates for individual equities implied
gains of 12 percent at the time, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  exceeded its record on
March 5, erasing losses from the financial crisis, and has
advanced 2.3 percent since then on signs the U.S. housing and
job markets are recovering.  Home prices  increased the most since
June 2006 in January, a report last month showed. First-time
jobless claims  unexpectedly  fell the week ended March 9.  “The move we’ve had so far does not mean it cannot
continue,” Warren Koontz, head of U.S. large-cap value stocks
at Loomis Sayles & Co. in  Boston , said in a March 26 phone
interview. His firm manages about $185 billion. “When we see
this dislocation between a near-term analyst opinion and what we
believe is longer-term and better potential that’s already being
reflected in the price, we look at that as an opportunity.”  Corn Processor  Archer-Daniels, the world’s largest corn processor, has
 rallied 23 percent  to $33.73 in 2013, after posting quarterly
earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ estimates. While the
stock posted its best quarterly gain since 2010 and has reached
an almost two-year high, analysts  haven’t raised their price
target  at the same pace. The average estimate of $32.38 is lower
than the stock price last week.  Shares of Mattel have surged 20 percent in 2013, almost
four times as fast as analysts pushed up estimates. At $43.77,
the stock is trading above the $43.27 projection. Analysts
estimated  Western Digital  was 21 percent underpriced throughout
2012, according to the average of their target prices compiled
by Bloomberg. That spread narrowed to 1 percent last week after
the maker of hard drives based in  Irvine ,  California   gained 18
percent  in 2013 to $50.29.  While analysts raised their price projection for  PG&E (PCG)  by
1.6 percent since February, it wasn’t enough to keep up with the
stock. The owner of California’s largest utility advanced 11
percent in 2013, pushing the price to $44.53, less than 1
percent below analysts’ target of $44.93, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “Many analysts and strategists have been skeptical of the
market’s advance and staying power, they know we are in record
territory and they don’t want to appear overly positive like
many did in 2000 and 2007,” said Howard Ward, chief investment
officer at Rye, New York-based Gamco Investors Inc., which
oversees $36.7 billion. “I would view analyst skepticism, to
the extent it exists, as a contrary indicator for the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
