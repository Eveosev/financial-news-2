West Texas Intermediate crude slid
from the highest close in six weeks, snapping its longest rally
this year.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut a pipeline that carries oil to
the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Futures dropped as much as 0.8 percent after five days of
gains through March 28 took last quarter’s advance to 5.9
percent. The Pegasus pipeline, shut March 29 after a leak in
 Arkansas , will need to be excavated as Exxon determines what
caused the breach, a spokeswoman said. WTI prices surged last
week as U.S. economic growth beat forecasts, sending U.S.
equities to a record March 28.  “U.S. crude inventories are at a fairly high level right
now, and the Pegasus pipeline shutdown will further increase
pressure,” Shi Yan, an analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. in
Shanghai, said in a phone interview. “Prices will stabilize or
weaken in the longer term as demand declines gradually.”  WTI for May delivery slipped as much as 81 cents to $96.42
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $96.55
at 7:53 a.m. in New York. It closed at $97.23 on March 28, the
highest settlement since Feb. 14, capping the longest rally
since Dec. 20.  Prices increased 3.8 percent last week and 5.6 percent in
March. The market was closed March 29 for Good Friday. The
volume of all futures traded was 22 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day.  Exxon Pegasus  Brent for May settlement lost 24 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$109.78 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Prices gained 2.2 percent last week. They fell 1.2
percent in March and 1 percent in the first quarter. Volumes for
all contracts were 76 percent below normal. The European grade’s
premium to WTI widened 59 cents to $13.38 a barrel after
settling March 28 at $12.79, the narrowest since July.  Exxon’s Pegasus system is a 20-inch diameter pipeline with
a capacity of about 96,000 barrels a day running from Patoka,
 Illinois , to Nederland,  Texas . The company expanded the line by
30,000 barrels a day in 2009 to carry more Canadian crude from
the Midwest to Gulf Coast refineries, it said in a June 17,
2009, statement. It was transporting Wabasca Heavy Crude from
Western  Canada  when it leaked, Kimberly Brasington, a
spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail.  The shutdown means less crude can be transported from the
U.S. Midwest, potentially exacerbating a glut of oil coming from
Canada to the Midwest.  Shell Pipeline  U.S  stockpiles  rose 0.9 percent in the week ended March 22
to the highest since June and stood 12 percent above the five-
year average. Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for WTI futures, increased 0.9 percent and were 54 percent
higher than the average.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  last week shut a 170,000 barrel-a-day
pipeline that moves  Gulf of Mexico  crude to Houma,  Louisiana ,
after the pipe leaked in Terrebonne Bay. Shell shut the 16-inch
pipeline, which starts on Caillou Island, at about 5 p.m., March
23 after a light oil sheen was observed near a pump station.  Money managers boosted net-long positions, or wagers on
higher U.S. prices, by 16 percent in the week ended March 26,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s March 29
Commitments of Traders report. It was the largest gain since the
seven days ended Dec. 18.  “The crude oil market doesn’t have any specific
fundamental factors, so it depends on the U.S. equity market,”
said  Tetsu Emori , a  fund manager  at Astmax Investment Management
Inc. in  Tokyo . “Some correction will be coming up next week in
the equity market. Crude oil should track such movement.”  Equities surged to a record last week after Commerce
Department data showed U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 0.4
percent annual rate, up from a prior estimate of 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
