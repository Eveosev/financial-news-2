Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Pegasus crude
oil pipeline, which was shut on March 29 after a leak was
detected in  Arkansas , will need to be excavated as the company
looks to determine what caused the breach, a spokeswoman said.  “I can’t speculate on when excavation will happen,”
Kimberly Brasington, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an
e-mail. “Excavation is necessary as part of an investigation to
determine the cause of the incident.”  The 20-inch pipeline, which originates in Patoka,  Illinois ,
and carries crude oil to the Texas Gulf Coast, was carrying
Wabasca Heavy Crude from Western Canada, she said.  About 12,000 barrels of oil and water have been collected
so far near Mayflower, Arkansas, after “a few thousand barrels
were observed in the area,” the Mayflower Incident Unified
Command Joint Information Center, which includes Exxon, Faulkner
County and the city of Mayflower, said in a statement today.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies any
spill of more than 250 barrels as a “major spill,” the command
said.  “Crews are steam-cleaning oil from property,” according
to the joint statement. No oil has reached Lake Conway, and
clean-up crews have deployed 3,600 feet of boom as a precaution,
the command said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
