Dana Gas PJSC (DANA)  said it expects to
complete refinancing of Islamic bonds next quarter as the United
Arab Emirates fuel producer receives payments from operations in
Egypt and  Iraq .  The Sharjah, U.A.E.-based company has collected $41.3
million of payments due from Egypt and $32.4 million from the
Kurdistan region of Iraq so far in 2013, Dana Gas said in an e-
mailed statement today. The gas producer renegotiated terms for
$920 million of sukuk last year after payment delays from the
two countries, linked to political instability.  “The company is confident of further progress in the
collection of receivables in the near future due to its strong
relationships in both countries,” Dana Gas said in the
statement. The company will hold a final shareholders meeting to
approve its sukuk refinancing on April 23, it said.  Payments this year follow the collection of $301 million
from authorities in  Egypt  and Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish
region in 2012, the company said. Dana Gas has added two new
wells in Egypt and is in talks with the Iraqi Ministry of
Natural Resources to expand in Kurdistan, it said.  The fuel producer said it will also start drilling at the
offshore Zora gas field in the U.A.E. in the third quarter.  The yield on Dana Gas’ notes was 8.62 percent on March 29,
down 49 basis points, or 0.49 percentage point, this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield rose as high
as 11.7 percent on Oct. 30, the day before Dana Gas missed
payments on its debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
