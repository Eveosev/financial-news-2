Former Swindon Town soccer coach
Paolo Di Canio is to have talks with Sunderland over its
managerial position after the dismissal of Martin O’Neill, Sky
Sports reported.  O’Neill was fired yesterday as Sunderland battles against
relegation from  England ’s Premier League. His departure came
hours after a 1-0 home loss to league leader Manchester United.  The Black Cats are 16th in the 20-team league, one point
above the three relegation positions at the bottom of the
standings.  O’Neill, 61, took over as coach in December 2011, replacing
Steve Bruce. Sunderland’s next game is April 7 at Chelsea.  Di Canio, who played for clubs including Juventus, Celtic
and West Ham, resigned as manager of third-tier Swindon in
February.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
