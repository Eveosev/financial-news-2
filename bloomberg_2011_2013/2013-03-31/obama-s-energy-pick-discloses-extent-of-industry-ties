Ernest Moniz, President  Barack Obama ’s nominee for energy secretary, performed consulting work
last year for  General Electric Co. (GE) ,  BP Plc (BP/) , and Riverstone
Equity Partners LP, according to his financial disclosure forms.  Moniz, 68, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, serves on the boards of directors of  American
Science & Engineering Inc. (ASEI) , which makes detection equipment used
at ports, and  ICF International Inc. (ICFI) , a consulting firm in
Fairfax,  Virginia , that reported in February that federal
contracts made up 58 percent of its fourth quarter revenue.  Moniz disclosed a net worth of between $5.4 million and
$18.1 million. He is scheduled to testify April 9 at a
confirmation hearing at the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee.  In a letter filed with the Office of Government Ethics,
Moniz said that if he is confirmed by the Senate, he would
resign his board seats, sell his common stock in ICF and forfeit
unvested restricted stock in ICF and American Science &
Engineering. He wrote that he would refrain for one year from
participating in matters directly affecting ICF, GE, BP,
Riverstone and several other companies and groups he has worked
for.  Moniz, who also is director of the MIT Energy Initiative,
received a salary of $304,168 from the university in 2012.  Stock Disclosure  According to his disclosure form, Moniz has between
$500,000 and $1 million in stock of American Science &
Engineering and a combined total of between $200,000 and
$500,000 in vested options and restricted stock.  He reported having between $100,000 and $250,000 in ICF
common stock and the same amount in restricted stock.  Moniz received $10,000 last year from GE for service on an
advisory board. He made $5,850 from BP and $75,000 from
Riverstone, which describes itself as a private equity firm
focused on energy and power. Moniz has done consulting for
Riverstone since 2008, for BP from 2005 to 2012 and for GE since
2008.  Since 2009, he has also been on an advisory council and the
board of trustees for the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and
Research Center in Saudi Arabia.  The Public Accountability Initiative, a research group in
Buffalo, New York, that is critical of the use of hydraulic
fracturing for natural gas, has been criticizing Moniz for his
ties with industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
