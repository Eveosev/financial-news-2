Kuwait Projects Co. (KPROJ) , known as
Kipco, reduced debt by 120 million dinars ($420 million) last
year and sees double-digit growth in core units in 2013, Vice
Chairman Faisal Al-Ayyar said.  The debt was repaid by units Kipco Asset Management Co.,
United Gulf Bank and  United Industries Co. (UIC) , Al-Ayyar told
shareholders today at the  Kuwait  City headquarters of the
country’s biggest privately owned investment firm.  “2013 could be a turning point in the outlook for the
regional and local economies and our companies are ready to
maximize the opportunities from this potential improvement in
their respective markets,” he said. “Growth will come from our
strategic core businesses.”  Kipco expects two of its companies, Orbit Showtime Network
and  Burgan Bank (BURG)  SAK, which in December acquired 99.3 percent of
Istanbul-based Eurobank Tekfen AS, to increase revenue by at
least 25 percent this year, Al-Ayyar said. Kipco’s food
manufacturing and real estate businesses expect growth of 15
percent and 10 percent, respectively, he said.  Kipco, whose biggest shareholder is controlled by members
of Kuwait’s ruling Al-Sabah family, has holdings in more than 60
companies. It reported a 4 percent rise in 2012 profit to 31.3
million dinars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
