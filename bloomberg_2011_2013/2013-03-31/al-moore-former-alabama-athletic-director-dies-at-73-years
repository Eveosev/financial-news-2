Mal Moore, who stepped down 11 days
ago after 14 years as director of athletics at the University of
 Alabama , has died, the school said. He was 73.  Moore died yesterday at Duke University Medical Center in
Durham, North Carolina, where he had been hospitalized with a
pulmonary condition for three weeks, Alabama said in a
statement.  “The University of Alabama and the world of
intercollegiate athletics have lost a legend, and I have lost a
dear friend,” Bill Battle, who replaced Moore, said in the
statement.  Moore played football for the Crimson Tide from 1958 to
1962 under then-head coach Paul “Bear” Bryant before joining
Bryant’s staff as an assistant coach. As a player, coach and
athletics director, he was part of 10 national championship
teams, 16 Southeastern Conference championships and 39 bowl
games.  Moore spent 22 of his 31 coaching years at Alabama, along
with time at Montana State, Notre Dame and the St. Louis and
Phoenix teams of the National Football League.  At Alabama, Moore began as Bryant’s graduate assistant in
1964, then was defensive backfield coach for six seasons from
1965-70 before becoming quarterbacks coach from 1971-82 and
serving as the Tide’s first offensive coordinator starting in
1975. He returned as offensive coordinator under Gene Stallings
from 1990-93 before moving into athletic administration.  National Championships  During Moore’s tenure as director of athletics from 1999 to
2013, Alabama produced national championship teams in football,
gymnastics, softball and women’s golf as well as Southeastern
Conference championships in football, basketball, baseball,
gymnastics, men’s and women’s golf, men’s cross country and
softball.  He directed more than $240 million of capital improvements
to Alabama athletic facilities. In 2007, Alabama’s board of
trustees recognized Moore’s contributions to the school by
renaming the Football Building as the Mal M. Moore Athletic
Facility.  In 2011, he was elected to the State of Alabama Sports Hall
of Fame for his accomplishments as a coach and an administrator.
After the completion of the 2011-12 academic and athletic
seasons, Moore was named the winner of the John L. Toner Award,
given to the nation’s best athletic director.  A native of Dozier, Alabama, he was born Dec. 19, 1939.
Moore is survived by one daughter, Heather Cook of Scottsdale,
 Arizona ; a granddaughter and a grandson. His wife of 41 years,
the former  Charlotte  Davis, died in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
