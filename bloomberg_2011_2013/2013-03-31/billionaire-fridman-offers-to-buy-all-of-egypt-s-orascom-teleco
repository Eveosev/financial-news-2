Russian billionaire  Mikhail Fridman 
offered to buy all of  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , the Egyptian
cellular company majority owned by Russia’s  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) ,
which he controls.  Fridman’s Altimo is offering 70 cents a share for Cairo-
based Orascom, the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority said
today, valuing the company at about $3.67 billion. Altimo owns
about 47.9 percent in VimpelCom, which in turn owns about 51.7
percent of Orascom.  Orascom fell 0.9 percent to 4.37 Egyptian pounds (64 cents)
at the close in Cairo, valuing the company at about $3.4
billion. The London-listed depositary receipts, which equal five
common shares, closed up 1 percent on March 28 to $3.18.  “We were expecting that they would be taking Orascom out
of the market, but we think it’s a very low price,” Maria Samir, a telecom analyst at Cairo-based investment bank Beltone
Financial, said by phone. “It doesn’t make sense to remain
listed when there are no operations in  Egypt  anymore.”  Orascom has assets in Algeria, Canada, Central African
Republic, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burundi and Zimbabwe, according
to its website.  Altimo’s press service in Moscow declined to comment on the
regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
