The Saudi Communications and
Information Technology Commission said some Internet
applications don’t comply with regulatory requirements, the
state-owned  Saudi Press Agency  reported, citing a statement.  The regulator informed local services companies that they
need to communicate with international application providers
including Skype, WhatsApp and  Viber  to make sure that their
offerings comply with Saudi regulations, the SPA said.  The regulator said it was responding to media reports that
the government was pressuring local phone companies to contact
application providers and threatening to ban them to gain access
to their services for monitoring purposes.  Appropriate action will be taken in the event any service
provider fails to meet those requirements, the commission said
in its statement. The regulator also said user privacy is of
utmost importance to it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
