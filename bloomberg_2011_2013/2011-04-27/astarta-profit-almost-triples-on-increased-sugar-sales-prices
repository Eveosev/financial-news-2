Astarta Holding NV (AST) , a Ukrainian
producer of refined sugar, said profit almost tripled last year
on increased sweetener sales and prices.  Net income rose to 80.1 million euros ($117 million), or
3.20 euros a share, from 29.5 million euros, or 1.18 euros, in
2009, the Kiev-based company said today on its  website . Sales
jumped 71 percent to 219.3 million euros. Astarta produced about
200,000 metric tons of refined sugar in 2010, accounting for
almost 13 percent of national output.  Sales of refined sugar rose 7 percent by volume last year
and surged 93 percent to 159.5 million euros by value, the
company said. Refined, or white, sugar averaged about $608 a ton
in NYSE Liffe trading last year, compared with $490.35 in 2009.
Grain and oilseed sales rose 21 percent to 40.4 million euros,
Astarta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
