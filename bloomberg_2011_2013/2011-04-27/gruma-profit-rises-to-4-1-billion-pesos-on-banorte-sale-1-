Gruma SAB, the largest maker of
tortilla corn-flour in  Mexico , posted a profit of 4.09 billion
pesos ($355 million) in the first quarter after selling its
stake at Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB.  A year earlier, the company reported a net income of 257
million pesos, Monterrey, Mexico-based Gruma said today in a
statement to Mexico’s stock exchange. Sales were 11.9 billion
pesos.  On Feb. 15, Gruma sold its remaining shares in Banorte,
Mexico’s third-largest bank by outstanding loans, for a total of
9.2 billion pesos, the company said in today’s statement.
Gruma’s taxes increased by 835 million pesos to 1.05 billion
pesos on the share sale, Gruma said.  First-quarter operating income was 678 million pesos.  Gruma, which makes Tortillas Mision, fell 18 centavos, or
