(Corrects year in second paragraph.)  Cyprus’s revenue from tourism rose
3.1 percent in the first quarter, after more Russian tourists
visited the east Mediterranean island and increased their
spending, the country’s  Statistical Service  said.  Revenue increased to 133.1 million euros ($195.3 million),
from 129.2 million euros in the same period of 2010, the
Statistical Service said in a  statement  on its website today.  The number of Russian visitors over the quarter climbed
around 48 percent and they spent an average per person of 2,906
euros, up from 2,835.6 euros.  Spending per visitor from the U.K., Cyprus’s biggest source
of visitors, rose 7.9 percent to 1,912.7 euros. The number of
British tourists fell more than 16 percent. Tourism accounts for
about one fifth of Cyprus’s economy, according to the London-
based  World Travel and Tourism Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
