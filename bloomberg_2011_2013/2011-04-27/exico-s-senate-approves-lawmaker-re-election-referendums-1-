Mexico ’s  Senate  passed a bill
that would allow local and federal lawmakers to seek re-
election, enable Congress to call national referendums and grant
the president additional power to veto the national budget.  During a session in Mexico City, 94 senators voted in favor
of the initiative, five voted against it and there were eight
abstentions.  The bill, a scaled-down version of a proposal made by
President Felipe Calderon in 2009, would allow lawmakers to
serve up to 12 consecutive years in office. State legislatures
can vote on whether to allow re-election for its lawmakers.  The initiative would allow the president to veto the annual
budget approved by Congress and allow independent candidates who
aren’t affiliated with a political party to run for the
presidency and other posts.  Under the new legislation, the president may propose two
“priority bills” per congressional session that lawmakers must
vote on before the period ends. It also allows citizens to
propose laws.  To become law, the bill needs approval from the  lower house 
and at least half of Mexico’s state legislatures, as well as the
president’s signature.  Lawmakers rejected parts of Calderon’s 2009 bill including a
proposal to reduce the size of the lower house to 400 lawmakers
from 500 and to cut the number of senators to 96 from 128.  The constitution doesn’t currently allow the president or
congress to call national referendums to vote on public policy
issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Adriana Lopez Caraveo in Mexico City at
