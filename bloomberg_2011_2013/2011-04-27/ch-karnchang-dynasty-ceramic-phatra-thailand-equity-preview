Shares of the following companies

Thailand’s biggest meat producer, gained 2.5 percent to 30.75
baht.  GFPT Pcl (GFPT) , the second-biggest listed poultry producer,
jumped 9.6 percent to 10.8 baht, its biggest gain since May 18.  Domestic prices of chicken meat rose to 55 baht ($1.84) per
kilogram yesterday, a 5.7 percent increase from a week earlier,
 Asia  Plus Securities Pcl wrote in a note today.  Siam Cement Pcl (SCC)  , the nation’s third-largest
publicly traded company, climbed 1.1 percent to 384 baht, the
highest close since at least 1990 when Bloomberg began
collecting the data. Net income in the first quarter increased
34 percent to 9.21 billion baht ($308 million) after revenue
from its chemicals business surged. That was higher than the
7.38 billion-baht median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  True Corp. (TRUE TB), which operates the nation’s third-
largest mobile-phone network, rose 1 percent to 5.05 baht, the
first advance in four days. True said a legal challenge to an
agreement with state-owned CAT Telecom won’t affect the
company’s plans to raise funds and expand its network. The
agreement, signed in January between CAT Telecom and True Corp.
to provide high-speed mobile-phone services in  Thailand , was
legal, Chief Executive Officer Supachai Chearavanont told
reporters today in Bangkok.  To contact the reporter on this story:
