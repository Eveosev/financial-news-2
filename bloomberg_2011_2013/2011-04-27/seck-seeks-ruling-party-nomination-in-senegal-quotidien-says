Idrissa Seck will seek to overturn
a decision by  Senegal ’s ruling party to name President Abdoulaye Wade as its candidate in an election to be held next year, le
Quotidien reported.  Senegal’s  Democratic Party  expelled Seck after he opposed
Wade for the party’s nomination last year, the Dakar-based
newspaper said.  Speaking to supporters at a rally yesterday, Seck said that
he is still a member of the Democratic Party, Quotidien
