Premier Foods Plc (PFD) , the U.K.’s
biggest food manufacturer, said first-half gross profit may
suffer as the company seeks to negotiate price increases to make
up for rising costs.  Percentage increases in raw materials costs are “in the
low teens,” the  St. Albans , England-based company said in a
statement on the Regulatory News Service. Also, grocery markets
“got off to a slow start” this year, with first-quarter sales
dropping 3.1 percent, the company said.  Global food prices are rising as demand for meat, edible
oils and corn increases. Premier said that, while it was able to
raise its prices to cover cost increases through the end of
March, inflation “remains an issue.”  “We continue to anticipate making progress in 2011, but
due to the pricing lag and the slow start to the year, the
profit delivery will be more weighted to the second half in 2011
than in 2010,” the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
