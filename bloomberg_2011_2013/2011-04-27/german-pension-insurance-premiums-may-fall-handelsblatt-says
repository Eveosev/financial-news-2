Contributions to  Germany ’s
mandatory pension insurance may decline next year as the
economy’s expansion boosting its reserves,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing the insurance’s chief Alexander Gunkel.  Based on economic growth forecasts by Germany’s leading
economic institutes, reserves will exceed 1.5 monthly payouts by
the end of the year, a threshold that requires a reduction in
contributions, Gunkel told the newspaper.  The contribution rate of 19.9 percent of gross pay may be
cut by a “small” amount next year and another 0.5 percentage
points in 2013, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
