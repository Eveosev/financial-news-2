The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
topped its February peak yesterday with fewer stocks driving the
rally, meaning investors should buy individual equities rather
than trust that bets on the entire market will be profitable,
Bespoke Investment Group said.  When the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities climbed to the
highest level since June 2008 yesterday, 17 percent of its
companies reached 52-week highs, compared with 21 percent at the
peak on Feb. 18. At the same time, 74 percent of the stocks
closed above their 50-day average price, less than the 75
percent established on April 6, Bespoke data show.  “When the  S&P 500  makes a new high, one would expect to
see the number of new highs in the index expand, and the more
the better,” Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Harrison,  New York- 
based research firm, wrote in a note published yesterday. “A
lower number of new highs indicates that the rally is
narrowing.” He added, “the tide would likely no longer lift
all boats.”  The S&P 500 surged 99 percent through yesterday from a 12-
year low in March 2009 amid economic stimulus measures from the
U.S. government and earnings that topped projections for the
ninth straight quarter.  “If the last two years has been like shooting fish in a
barrel, going forward investors will need to increasingly focus
on technique and style,” he said.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
