Straumann Holding AG (STMN) , the world’s
largest dental implant maker, fell the most in more than six
months after first-quarter revenue missed analysts’ estimates.  Sales declined 5.4 percent to 188.4 million Swiss francs
($214 million), falling short of the 194.1 million-franc
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of seven analysts. Straumann
doesn’t report quarterly profit figures.  The strong franc against major currencies curtailed revenue
by 9 percent, despite growth in all markets, the Basel,
Switzerland-based company said in a  statement  today.  Straumann fell as much as 7.7 percent, the most since Oct.
12, and traded at 227 francs, down 5.2 percent, at 4:20 p.m. in
Zurich.  The company today reiterated a forecast that its sales
growth will outpace the market in 2011, assuming market growth
in the “mid-single-digit-percentage range.” Operating margin
will likely be around the same level as last year’s 20 percent,
Straumann said.  Analysts, who had estimated this year’s operating margin at
more than 21 percent before results were released today, will
likely cut their forecasts due to uncertainty in  Japan ,  Tom Jones , an analyst at Berenberg Bank, wrote in a research note
today.  Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN) , Straumann’s Zurich-based rival
which reports first-quarter results tomorrow, fell as much as 7
percent, also the most since Oct. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
