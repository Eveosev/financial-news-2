Greek, Irish and Portuguese bonds
slumped and costs to insure the securities against default
climbed to all-time highs as concern deepened that the nations
will need to restructure their debts.  Greek two-year yields rose above 25 percent for the first
time, while 10-year yields advanced to euro-era highs for the
ninth consecutive day. Portuguese two- and 10-year and Irish 10-
year yields also reached records. German two-year notes slid as
a report showed inflation in Europe’s largest economy
accelerated in April and the nation sold 10-year bonds.  “The talk about restructuring or rescheduling of Greek
debt is not going away,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income
strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “As long as
no one can offer the market reassurance that there isn’t going
to be a rescheduling or a restructuring, then the market will
keep on pricing in more and more.”  Greek two-year yields surged as much as 171 basis points to
25.95 percent and were at 25.53 percent as of 4:17 p.m. in
London. The 4.6 percent security due May 2013 fell 1.35, or 13.5
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,466) face amount, to 69.44. Ten-year
yields soared as much as 101 basis points to 16.34 percent.  Portuguese 10-year yields rose as much as 10 basis points
to 9.71 percent, while two-year yields climbed 19 basis points
to 11.87 percent, also records.  ‘Lost Decade’  The cost of insuring debt sold by  Greece , Ireland and
Portugal rose to records today, according to traders of credit-
default swaps. Contracts on Greece jumped 21 basis points to
1,376 basis points, according to CMA. Contracts on Irish debt
added 11 basis points to 685, while Portuguese swaps climbed
seven basis points to 688.  Greece faces the risk of a Latin American-style lost decade
as a result of its debt crisis, Mohamed El-Erian, chief
executive officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., the
world’s biggest manager of bond funds, told Germany’s
Handelsblatt.  “ Latin America  suffered from a ‘lost decade’ for growth,
employment and investment,” El-Erian wrote in the Dusseldorf-
based newspaper. “Greece today faces the same danger,” as it’s
“far away” from financial stability and isn’t closer to
gaining access to international financial markets, he said.  Greece’s two-year note yields have added more than 1,000
basis points since the start of the month, while  Portugal ’s have
gained more than 300 basis points. Ireland’s have risen more
than 200 basis points over the same period.  Greek Spread  Earlier this month, Portugal became the third euro-region
country to seek an international bailout after Greece sparked a
sovereign-debt crisis that threatened to splinter the currency
bloc a year ago and then engulfed Ireland.  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold Greek
10-year bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened
81 basis points to 1,289 basis points, after reaching 1,305, the
most since at least March 1998, when Bloomberg started
collecting the data.  There is no plan to allow Greece to restructure its debts,
European Union Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs
Olli Rehn said in Helsinki today.  The Greek government has taken “significant decisions” on
reducing its  budget deficit  that will help it “stabilize its
public finances,” Rehn said.  Greece’s 2010 budget gap was more than a percentage point
wider than the government estimated after a revision by  Europe ’s
statistics agency, a report yesterday showed. Last year’s
shortfall was 10.5 percent of gross domestic product, compared
with 15.4 percent of GDP in 2009, Eurostat said in a statement.
In February, the Greek government said it met its revised target
for a 9.4 percent deficit in 2010.  Irish Notes  Ireland’s two-year notes appreciated today for the first
time in eight trading days, pushing the yield down nine basis
points to 12 percent. The note yield rose above 12 percent
yesterday for the first time since before the introduction of
the euro. Ten-year yields advanced as much as 20 basis points to
10.66 percent, a euro-era high.  German two-year note yields gained eight basis points to
1.81 percent as inflation quickened in April, adding to pressure
on the  European Central Bank  to raise  interest rates .  The harmonized inflation rate jumped to 2.6 percent from
2.3 percent in March, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said today. That’s in line with the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 21 economists. Consumer prices rose 0.2
percent in the month.  German Sentiment  The 10-year bund yield rose by four basis points to 3.29
percent after  Germany  sold 4.88 billion euros of 3.25 percent
securities due 2021. The average yield was 3.28 percent,
compared with 3.24 percent at the previous sale of similar-
maturity debt on March 23. Investors bid for 1.4 times the
amount of bonds on offer, the least since October, and down from
a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 2.16 previously.  Nuremburg-based GfK AG today forecast that its consumer-
sentiment index will fall to 5.7 in May from 5.9 in April.
Economists predicted a decline to 5.8, according to the median
of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  European Central Bank policy makers increased their
benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent at
their April 7 meeting to keep a lid on price pressures. The
central bank is balancing the need for higher borrowing costs in
countries like Germany against soaring bond yields in the
region’s most-indebted nations. It meets again on May 5.  Dutch Sale  The Netherlands sold 1 billion euros of 4.25 percent bonds
due in July 2013 with an average yield of 1.894 percent and 1.55
billion euros of 4 percent bonds due in July 2018 with an
average yield of 3.211 percent, the  Finance Ministry  said today.  Italy sold 1.16 billion euros of inflation-protected notes
due in 2016 and 593 million euros of inflation-linked bonds
maturing in 2021. The nation plans to sell as much as 10.5
billion euros of securities due in 2014, 2018 and 2021 tomorrow.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 1.7
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
U.S. Treasuries have returned 0.9 percent. Italian debt has
earned 0.8 percent, the indexes show, while Greek debt has lost
11.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
