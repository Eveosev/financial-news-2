Embotelladora Andina SA,  Chile ’s
largest Coca-Cola bottler, reported a 15 percent slump in first-
quarter profit as raw material costs rose.  Net income slid to 28 billion pesos ($60.6 million) from
32.8 billion pesos a year earlier, according to a statement
posted on the website of Chile’s securities regulator. The
average estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for
profit of 30.3 billion pesos.  “The weather in  Brazil  affected volumes and the higher
costs of raw materials had an impact upon comparing figures with
the previous year,” the company said in an e-mailed statement.  Embotelladora Andina rose 0.7 percent to 2,245 pesos in
Santiago trading today, reducing a year-to-date fall to 5.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
