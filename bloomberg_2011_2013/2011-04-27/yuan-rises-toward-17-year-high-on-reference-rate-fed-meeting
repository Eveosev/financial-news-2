China ’s yuan rose toward a 17-year
high as the central bank strengthened its reference rate for the
currency and expectations the U.S. will maintain near-zero
 interest rates  weighed on the dollar.  The  Federal Reserve  will keep its target rate for overnight
lending between banks at zero to 0.25 percent when a policy
meeting concludes today, according to all 83 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia-Dollar Index,
which tracks the region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding
the yen, gained the most in a week. The People’s Bank of China
set the yuan’s reference rate 0.12 percent higher at 6.5096 per
dollar, the strongest level since July 2005.  “The yuan fixing reflects the weakness in the dollar as we
are not going to see any signal on policy changes in the U.S.,”
said  Patrick Bennett , a Hong Kong-based strategist at Standard
Bank Group Ltd. “They’ll continue to keep rates at an extremely
low level while Asian economies are tightening.”  The yuan strengthened 0.27 percent to 6.5112 per dollar as
of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. That’s the biggest one-day gain
since Jan 11. The currency reached 6.5067 on April 22, the
strongest level since the country unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993. It isn’t allowed to move more
than 0.5 percent either side of the daily fixing.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.17 percent
to 6.3330 per dollar in Hong Kong, a 2.8 percent premium to the
onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In
 Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.12 percent to
6.4925 per dollar.  The People’s Bank of China raised its benchmark one-year
lending and deposit rates this month by a quarter of a
percentage point to 6.31 percent and 3.25 percent, respectively,
the fourth increase since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
