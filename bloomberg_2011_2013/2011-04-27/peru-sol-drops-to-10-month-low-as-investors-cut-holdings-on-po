Peru ’s sol fell to a ten-month low
as growing support for presidential candidate Ollanta Humala
spurred foreign investors to reduce their holdings of Peruvian
financial assets.  The sol declined 0.1 percent to 2.8325 per U.S. dollar at
12:52 p.m. New York time, from 2.8290 yesterday. The currency
earlier sank to 2.8350, the weakest since June.  Some foreign investors with soles and sol-denominated bonds
are selling holdings after an April 24 poll showed Humala,
leader of Peru’s Nationalist Party, leading before a June 5
runoff vote, said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco
Santander  in Lima. Humala has pledged to change the country’s
constitution to give the state a stronger role in the economy,
increase social spending and revise a free trade accord with the
U.S.  “After the poll on Sunday, there is a lot more
nervousness,” Navarro said.  The central sold 500 million soles ($176 million) of sol-
indexed securities at an auction today, twice the amount it
offered initially, to slow the sol’s decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
