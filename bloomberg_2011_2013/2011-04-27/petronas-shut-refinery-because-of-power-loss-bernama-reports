Petroliam Nasional Bhd, Malaysia’s
state-owned oil company, said its Melaka refinery was forced to
shut yesterday after losing power from the national grid, the
Malaysian news agency Bernama reported.  Petronas, as the company is known, is resuming operations,
according to Bernama, which cited a statement by the company.  A call to Petronas’s head office in  Kuala Lumpur  wasn’t
answered when Bloomberg News phoned today.  The refinery has two sections, each capable of processing
100,000 barrels of crude oil a day, according to Petronas’s
 website . The second section, called PSR-2 is a venture with
 ConocoPhillips (COP) , a U.S.-based refiner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
