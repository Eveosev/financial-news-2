Japan ’s bonds rose, pushing 10-year
yields to a one-month low, as a report showed industrial
production fell by a record, demonstrating the effect of last
month’s deadly earthquake and tsunami on the nation’s economy.  Bond futures completed a third weekly advance on
speculation evidence the economy is weakening prompted the  Bank
of Japan  to keep monetary easing measures in place to spur
growth. Bonds also gained as the central bank today cut its
gross domestic product growth forecast for the year ending March
2012 to 0.6 percent from 1.6 percent.  “The economic data were really bad, which is supportive of
bonds,” said Jun Fukashiro, a  money manager  who helps oversee
about $16.6 billion at Toyota Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo .
“The BOJ is likely to maintain its comprehensive monetary
easing for a long time.”  The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due March 2021 fell one
basis point to 1.205 percent at 3:28 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
price gained 0.088 yen to 100.837 yen. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The yield earlier reached 1.20 percent, the lowest since
March 24. It was 1.255 percent on March 31. Japan’s markets will
be closed for a public holiday tomorrow.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery rose 0.11 to 140.05
at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The contracts reached 140.08, the
highest since March 17. They are up from 139.75 on April 22.  Factory Output  Japan’s government bonds have handed investors a 0.3
percent return this month, compared with a loss of 0.3 percent
this year, according to an index compiled by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.  Factory output fell 15.3 percent in March from February,
the biggest drop since data began in 1953, and household
spending sank 8.5 percent from a year earlier, government
reports showed today.  “Today’s data make it difficult to sell bonds,” said
Shinichi Horikawa, who helps to manage the equivalent of $12.2
billion at Mitsui Sumitomo Kirameki Life Insurance Co. “The
earthquake’s impact is very big, and I’d like to see more data
to gauge the whole effect.”  The BOJ today maintained a 30 trillion yen ($367 billion)
credit program and a 10-trillion yen asset-purchase fund, while
keeping the benchmark interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1
percent.  Japan’s sovereign-rating outlook was cut yesterday to
“negative” by  Standard & Poor’s  which said the nation’s
reconstruction needs will likely add to what’s already the
world’s biggest debt load.  Bonds earlier declined after Treasuries fell yesterday as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the  U.S. economy 
is in a moderate recovery and policy makers raised their
inflation estimate.  Treasury 10-year yields gained five basis points to 3.36
percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6 percent
yesterday. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 1.6 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
