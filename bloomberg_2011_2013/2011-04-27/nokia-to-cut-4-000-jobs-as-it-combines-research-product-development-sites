Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , which was overtaken by
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  as the largest maker of mobile phones last quarter,
will eliminate 7,000 jobs and transfer its Symbian software
development to  Accenture Plc (ACN)  in the Finnish company’s biggest
reorganization in two decades.  Accenture, the second-largest technology-consulting
company, will take on 3,000 Nokia workers in  China , Finland,
 India , the U.K. and the U.S. by the end of this year, the
companies said today. Nokia, which is switching to Microsoft
Corp.’s Windows Phone 7, will cut an additional 4,000 positions.  Symbian smartphones have struggled to keep up with the
iPhone and handsets based on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android system.
Nokia’s stock has lost about two thirds of its value since Apple
introduced the iPhone in 2007, raising consumer expectations for
handsets that can surf the Web and show movies to be simple to
operate. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop said today he’ll
keep all Finnish sites open with Nokia’s headquarters to remain
in the country.  “The big surprise is Accenture,” Ben Wood, a London-based
analyst at CCS Insight, said in a phone interview. “Nokia is
moving quickly to transition Symbian out of the company in order
to ensure complete focus on Windows Phone 7. This is the
beginning of the long and painful journey.”  Shares Rise  Espoo-based Nokia rose as much as 24 cents, or 4 percent,
to 6.20 euros and was up 3 percent at 6.14 euros as of 5:11 p.m.
in Helsinki, giving the company a market value of 23 billion
euros ($33.8 billion). It has fallen 25 percent since the Feb.
11 alliance with Microsoft. Accenture added 0.5 percent to
$56.98 in  New York .  The 7,000 positions account for almost 12 percent of
Nokia’s workforce, excluding those employed at a venture with
Siemens AG and at the Navteq maps division.  “The numbers are broadly in line but a bit more than I
expected,” said Heikki Kauppi, chairman of the Federation of
Professional and Managerial Employees, which represents more
than 8,000 of Nokia’s 13,000 employees in its category in
Finland, in an interview. “I’m generally satisfied with Nokia’s
good effort in investing in the reemployment of those laid
off.”  The Pro union, which represents office workers, said in a
statement that it is “satisfied at this stage with Nokia’s
efforts to assure continuing work for the personnel.”  Windows Phone 7  Under today’s agreement, Accenture will also work for
Nokia on projects based on Windows Phone 7. The deal will help
Dublin-based Accenture, which employs more than 215,000 people
and also offers outsourcing services, to offer clients new
mobile and software services, said Marty Cole, head of
Accenture’s Communications and High Tech unit.  Accenture reported sales of $21.6 billion in the fiscal
year ended Aug. 31. In 2009, the company bought Nokia’s
professional services unit that provides engineering and support
of the Symbian operating system to mobile-device manufacturers
and service providers.  Elop, 47, is seeking to restore Nokia’s smartphone
prospects after deciding that its own Symbian and MeeGo systems
couldn’t keep up with rivals’ phones.  First-quarter net income declined 1.4 percent to 344
million euros, Nokia said last week. Handset revenue rose 6.4
percent to 7.09 billion euros ($10.4 billion), surpassed for the
first time by iPhone sales of $12.3 billion in the period.  Market Share  Nokia’s smartphone market share fell to 30.8 percent at the
end of last year, 20 percentage points lower than the level at
the iPhone’s introduction, according to researcher Gartner Inc.  CEO Elop said last week that he plans to slash 1 billion
euros in expenses at the handset business by 2013.  The 4,000 job cuts will affect mainly  Denmark , Finland and
the U.K. and will take place by the end of 2012, Nokia said.
Those reductions include 1,400 workers in Finland, Elop said at
a press conference in Espoo. Nokia will close several sites
outside Finland, including a development unit in Copenhagen and
its U.S. base in  White Plains , New York, he said. No more job
cuts are planned, the CEO said.  About 700 jobs in the U.K. will go, the local Unite union
said in a statement, adding that it will take part in a
“concerted campaign” to halt the job losses.  ‘Clarity’  “We have new clarity around our path forward,” Elop said.
“We are working closely with our employees and partners to
identify long-term re-employment programs for the talented
people of Nokia.”  Nokia added about 5,000 employees in the last year,
including about 1,000 at Navteq and about 2,000 at Nokia Siemens
Networks, the venture with Siemens.  Nokia’s headcount declined by 31 percent between 1990 and
1993, according to annual reports, as the company shed units
making rubber products and computers. The handsets organization
has more than doubled in size since 1999, to 58,642 people at
the end of last year. The company reported a total headcount of
130,951 as of March 31, 2010.  “Nokia’s announcements today show that the worst fears
regarding employees have not been realized,” Economy Minister
Mauri Pekkarinen and Employment Minister Anni Sinnemaeki said in
a statement. “However Nokia’s decision will have significant
consequences for research and product development in the
information technology sector in  Finland .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
