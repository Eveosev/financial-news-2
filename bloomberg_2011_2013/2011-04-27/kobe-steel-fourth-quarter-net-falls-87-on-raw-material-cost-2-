Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406) ,  Japan ’s fourth-
largest steelmaker, posted an 87 percent decline in fourth-
quarter profit as raw material costs increased.  Net income fell to 5.7 billion yen ($70 million) in the
quarter ended March 31 from 44.2 billion yen a year earlier, the
Kobe-based company said today in a statement. Sales increased 8
percent to 502.7 billion yen in the quarter.  Rising costs for  iron ore  and coking coal, the key raw
materials used to make steel, are squeezing profit margins at
steelmakers. Kobe Steel may incur a pretax loss from operations
or see a “substantial drop” in earnings at its steel division
in the current quarter from the previous three months as it
struggles to pass on increased costs onto buyers, Executive Vice
President Hiroaki Fujiwara said today at a briefing in  Tokyo .  Contract prices for Australian iron ore rose 8.4 percent in
the January to March quarter from the previous three months, and
surged about 25 percent to an estimated $171 a metric ton in the
current quarter, according to an April 22 report by Daiwa
Capital Markets.  The company didn’t give a forecast for the year started
April 1, saying it’s unable to make a reasonable estimate
because it has yet to determine the impact of last month’s
earthquake, and shorter-term contract prices for coal and iron
ore have made it difficult to fix costs.  Kobe Steel will have to cut crude steel output in the three
months to June 30 from the previous quarter’s 1.9 million metric
tons, as the disaster disrupted production of cars due to
shortages of parts, Fujiwara said.  For the year ended March 31, Kobe Steel reported full-year
profit rose more than eightfold as booming economies in  Asia 
fuelled demand.  Net income rose to 52.9 billion yen in the 12 months ended
March 31 from 6.3 billion yen a year earlier, the company said.
Sales rose 11 percent to 1.86 trillion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
