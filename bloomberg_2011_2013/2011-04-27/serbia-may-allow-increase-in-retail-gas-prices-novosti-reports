The Serbian government may approve
higher natural  gas prices  for households and businesses as of
June to help state-run Srbijagas cope with rising import costs
and thousands of consumers in payment delinquency,  Vecernje
Novosti  reported, citing unidentified government officials.  The authorities may agree to a 9 percent to 12 percent
increase instead of 20 percent asked by  Srbijagas , depending on
a recommendation expected from  Serbia â€™s  Energy Agency , the
newspaper reported. Clients owe Srbijagas some 680 million euros
($998 million), according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
