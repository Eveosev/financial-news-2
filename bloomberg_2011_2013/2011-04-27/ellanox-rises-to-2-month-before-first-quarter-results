Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  climbed
to the highest level in more than two months on investor
speculation the maker of semiconductor-based products will post
a profit in the first quarter after markets close.  The shares advanced 2.3 percent to 98.50 shekels, the
highest since Feb. 14, at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .  The median estimate of three analysts is for net income of
$825,000 after a loss in the fourth-quarter, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Mellanox is expected to post good first-quarter
numbers,” said Joseph Wolf, a Tel Aviv-based analyst at
Barclays Plc. “We expect the merger with Voltaire and upside
potential from Oracle, which we expect to be a major customer in
2011” to help earnings this year, he said. Wolf has an
“overweight” recommendation on the Yokneam Elit, Israel-based
company.  Mellanox, whose products make data travel more easily at
data centers, investment banks and  stock exchanges , bought
Voltaire in February for about $208 million. As a result, sales
could reach $1.5 billion within the coming years, Chief
Executive Officer Eyal Waldman said in January without being
more specific. The company is 10.1 percent owned by Oracle
Corp., according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
