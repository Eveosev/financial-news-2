Sun Resorts Ltd., the second-
largest leisure operator in Mauritius by market value, advanced
the most in more than a week after forecasting 2011 profit would
beat earnings from a year earlier.  The stock rose 1.7 percent, or 1 rupee, to 60 rupees at the
1:30 p.m. close of trading in  Port Louis , the biggest jump since
April 15.  “The management told analysts yesterday that earnings for
financial year 2011 will be better than last year, even though
they remain cautious,” Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at Port
Louis-based Axys Stockbroking Ltd., said in a phone interview
today.  Sun Resorts’ after-tax profits will increase at least 20
percent in 2011 to 277 million rupees ($10 million) from a year
earlier, Axys said in a research note dated April 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
