All Nippon Airways Co.,  Japan ’s
largest listed carrier, boosted its profit estimate for the year
ended March after tax changes offset a 19 billion yen ($232
million) drop in sales following last month’s earthquake.  Net income will likely total 23 billion yen compared with
an earlier forecast of 6 billion yen, the Tokyo-based carrier
said in a statement today. It cut its sales estimate by 1.4
percent to 1.36 trillion yen.  The airline also doubled its full-year dividend forecast to
2 yen a share because of the higher profit outlook, which was
linked to deferred tax assets. The tax change helped the carrier
withstand a plunge in Japan travel after the magnitude-9 temblor
crippled a nuclear-power plant north of  Tokyo .  The disaster had a “drastic” impact on travel, the
carrier said.  All Nippon fell 0.4 percent to 227 yen at the 3 p.m. close
in Tokyo trading today, before the earnings forecast. It has
plunged 20 percent since March 10, the last day of trading
before the earthquake.  The carrier’s domestic passenger numbers fell 25 percent
from March 11 to March 21, while international numbers dropped
15 percent, Megumi Tezuka, a spokeswoman, said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
