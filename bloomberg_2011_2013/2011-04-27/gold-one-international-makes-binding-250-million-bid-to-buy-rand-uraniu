Gold One International Ltd. (GDO) , a
producer of the precious metal in  South Africa , agreed to buy
 Rand Uranium Ltd.  from Harmony Gold Mining Ltd. and other
investors for $250 million, boosting output.  “The binding offer has been accepted,” Johannesburg-based
Gold One said in a statement today. Harmony, Africa’s third-
largest gold producer, holds 40 percent of the uranium and gold
company, while a private-equity group comprising Pamodzi
Resources Fund, First Reserve Corp. and AMCI Capital owns the
rest, Rand Uranium said in a separate statement.  The acquisition will expand Gold One’s output to about
300,000 ounces of gold a year and give it access to an estimated
90 million pounds of uranium resources in South Africa. The cash
deal will increase funds at Harmony, which is studying plans to
build a mine costing at least $3 billion in  Papua New Guinea 
with  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)   Gold One fell 6 percent to 0.47 Australian cents at the
4:10 p.m. close in Sydney, after rallying 15 percent in the last
trading session. Harmony dropped 0.8 percent to 99 rand at the 5
p.m. close of trading in Johannesburg.  Harmony sold uranium assets to Pamodzi in 2007 and together
they set up Rand Uranium.  Gold One is also in early talks on a potential change of
control, the company said today.  China ’s Baiyin Non-Ferrous
Metal Group Co. bought 17.7 percent of Gold One for A$75.8
million ($81.5 million) last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
