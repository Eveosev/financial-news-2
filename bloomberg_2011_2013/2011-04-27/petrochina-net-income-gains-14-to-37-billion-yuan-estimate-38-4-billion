PetroChina Co.,  Asia ’s biggest
company by market value, posted a 14 percent gain in first-
quarter profit, missing estimates, after increases in state-
controlled fuel prices lagged behind gains in crude oil costs.  Net income rose to 37 billion yuan ($5.7 billion), or 0.2
yuan a share, from 32.5 billion yuan, or 0.18 yuan, a year
earlier, PetroChina said in a statement to the Shanghai stock
exchange today. That compares with a median estimate of 38.4
billion yuan in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  China ’s government raised fuel prices by less than 11
percent so far this year to contain inflation even as New York
crude averaged 20 percent higher in the quarter from a year
earlier. The higher price of oil increased PetroChina’s
operating costs by 46 percent, according to the statement.  “ Oil prices  are rising toward the critical point of $130 a
barrel at which the government may freeze domestic fuel prices
under the current pricing mechanism,” Grace Liu, an oil analyst
with Guotai Junan Securities Ltd., said by phone from Shenzhen.
“PetroChina’s refining operations will be a victim of China’s
cautious approach to fuel prices.”  The government is allowed to adjust oil-product prices when
crude costs change more than 4 percent over 22 working days.
China last raised gasoline and diesel prices by as much as 5.8
percent April 7 after crude hit a 30-month high. First-quarter
refining losses reached 6.1 billion yuan, PetroChina said.  The shares rose 27 percent in Hong Kong trading in the past
12 months, compared with the 12 percent gain in the benchmark
 Hang Seng  index. PetroChina fell 0.5 percent to HK$11.60 today,
before the earnings announcement.  Chinese Economy  Exploration and production accounted for 78 percent of
PetroChina’s 2010 operating income. Refining and marketing had a
12 percent share.  PetroChina processed 16 percent more crude in the first
quarter and is planning to increase fuel output to meet demand
from farmers and help supply the world’s biggest car market.
Fuel sales rose 17 percent in the quarter.  China’s economy  expanded 9.7 percent in the first three
months, beating a median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists for growth of 9.4 percent. The country’s apparent
fuel demand may rise 8 percent this year, the National Energy
Administration said on April 22.  First-quarter crude output rose 4.3 percent from a year
earlier to 219 million barrels, PetroChina said in the statement.
Natural gas production climbed 7.1 percent to 639.3 billion
cubic feet.  Overseas Assets  PetroChina has spent $9.2 billion since the start of last
year on assets to supply the world’s fastest-growing major
economy. In February, the company bought a C$5.4 billion ($5.7
billion) share of Encana Corp.’s gas assets in British Columbia
and Alberta in its biggest overseas acquisition to meet demand
for the cleaner-burning fuel.  The Chinese energy producer wants half its oil and gas
output to come from overseas by 2020, Chairman Jiang Jiemin said
in an interview on last year. Less than a tenth of production
now comes from abroad.  Profit at PetroChina may rise by 20 percent to 166.9
billion yuan in 2011, according to a mean estimate of 17
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The Chinese oil and gas producer was overtaken by Apple Inc.
as the world’s most valuable company after Exxon Mobil Corp.
