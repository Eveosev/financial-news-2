Federal Reserve  Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke’s decision to hold a news conference on monetary policy
scraps the traditional inclination “to say as little as
possible and give ground grudgingly,” former Fed Vice Chairman
 Alan Blinder  said.  “I don’t think you can go back to the Dark Ages, and I
don’t think you want to go back to the Dark Ages,” Blinder, who
served at the Fed in the 1990s, said today in an interview on
Bloomberg Television.  The air of mystery has been the hallmark of U.S. central
banking since before the Federal Reserve was established almost
a century ago, he said.  The shift toward openness, which has been gradual, shows
“it’s hard to teach an old dog new tricks,” said Blinder, a
professor of economics at  Princeton University  in New Jersey,
vice chairman of Promontory Financial Group and co-director of
the Center for Economic Policy Studies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
