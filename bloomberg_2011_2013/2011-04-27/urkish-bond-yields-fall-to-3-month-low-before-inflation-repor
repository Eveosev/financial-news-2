Turkey ’s two-year bond yield fell
to the lowest level in almost three months on speculation the
central bank will signal tomorrow inflation remains in check,
leaving room for policy makers to keep  interest rates  on hold.  The two-year note yield dropped 7 basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to its lowest since Feb 2 at 8.23 percent at
the 5 p.m. close, according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond
Index. The lira gained 0.2 percent to 1.5217 per dollar.  The central bank will probably raise its 2011 inflation
forecast to above 6 percent in its quarterly outlook, from 5.9
percent predicted in January, Cevdet Cagdas Unal, an Istanbul-
based economist at Finansbank AS, said in an e-mail. While
that’s higher than the central bank’s target of 5.5 percent, it
will probably be less than the 6.9 percent projected by lenders
and economists in a central bank report published on April 26.  “Tomorrow’s inflation report will be important for gauging
the central bank’s latest views,” London-based UBS strategists
Manik Narain and Bhanu Baweja said in a note to clients. “We
only expect modest upward revisions to consumer-price index
forecasts, with the current policy stance likely to be
retained.”  Turkey’s central bank kept its one-week repo lending rate
at record low of 6.25 percent on April 21, while increasing
 reserve requirements  for banks to curb lending. Policy makers
said they expected inflation to end the year “somewhat above”
the official target. The central bank is required to keep
inflation within two percentage points of its target, according
to the bank’s annual  report .  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  fell 731.66, or 1.1 percent, to
67,792.69.  To contact the reporter on this story:
