Jordan switched to alternative
fuels, after an explosion in Sinai halted Egyptian natural-gas
supplies, that is costing the kingdom 3 million dinars ($4.2
million) a day, an Energy Ministry spokesman said.  Jordan was informed that the blast occurred at a section of
the pipeline network before it divides into separate branches to
Jordan and  Israel , Mahmoud Al-Ees said today in a telephone
interview from Amman. Repairs needed to restart gas exports will
take one week, he said.  “We were forced to shift power stations to alternative
fuels, fuel oil and diesel, which costs us 3 million dinars per
day,” Al-Ees said.  Egypt  suspended gas exports to Israel and Jordan for the
second time this year after saboteurs blew up a monitoring room
in the pipeline network, Egyptian Oil Ministry spokesman Hamdi
Abdel Aziz said. Gunmen had attacked the link on Feb. 5 during
protests that led to the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak ,
cutting shipments for more than a month.  Jordan has fuel oil and diesel reserves to operate its
power stations for more than two weeks, Jordanian Energy
Minister Khalid Touqan told state-run news agency Petra. The
kingdom will also increase its share of the electricity exported
by Egypt into an Arab regional  power grid , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
