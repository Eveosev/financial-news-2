(Corrects name and location of Ladenburg Thalmann in fifth
paragraph.)  FriendFinder Networks Inc., the
publisher of Penthouse magazine, will seek as much as $60
million in an initial public offering.  The  Boca Raton , Florida-based operator of websites
including AdultFriendFinder.com and Cams.com will attempt to
sell 5 million shares at $10 to $12 each, it said in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  FriendFinder postponed an IPO last year that sought to
raise as much as $240 million. At least 31 companies have
announced plans for U.S. IPOs this month, the most since August
2007, according to Renaissance Capital LLC, the Greenwich,
Connecticut-based IPO investment firm.  FriendFinderâ€™s revenue for the year ended Dec. 31 was $346
million, while the net loss was $43.2 million, according to the
filing. The company, which unsuccessfully bid to take over
Chicago-based Playboy Enterprises Inc. last year, intends to use
proceeds from the IPO to repay debt, the filing shows.  Imperial Capital Group Inc. of  Los Angeles  and  Ladenburg
Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (LTS)  of Miami are leading the
offering.  The shares are expected to price May 11, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, and will list on the Nasdaq Stock Market
under the symbol FFN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
