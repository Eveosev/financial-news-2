Uganda ’s main opposition leader,
 Kizza Besigye , was granted bail after being arrested last week
for taking part in a protest against accelerating inflation.  Besigye was granted bail of 50 million shillings ($21,000)
on condition that he doesn’t breach the peace over the next
seven months, Wafula Ogutu, spokesman for the Forum for
Democratic Change party that Besigye leads, said in a phone
interview today from Kampala, the capital.  “He was granted bail and a bond, but the terms are
ridiculous and I don’t think he will respect them,” Ogutu said.
“He is not supposed to walk just because people will follow him,
which we find unacceptable since it is his right to walk.”  Besigye, who was defeated by President Yoweri Museveni in a
Feb. 18 election, was detained on April 21 for defying a
government ban on so-called walk-to-work protests.  Demonstrations have been organized in the East African
country to protest surging prices for staple foods and gasoline,
after inflation accelerated to 11.1 percent in March, from 6.4
percent a month earlier. The government has said the actions by
the protesters are unlawful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
