U.K. natural gas for May rose,
snapping two days of losses, as demand increased and supplies
were forecast to decline. Power followed gas higher.  National Grid Plc, manager of Britain’s pipeline network,
forecast gas demand at 285 million cubic meters in the 24 hours
through 6 a.m.  London  time tomorrow. That’s about 20 million
more than yesterday. The nation’s pipeline’s will contain 324
million cubic meters of gas at that time, 21 million less than
at the start of today.  Gas for May advanced 1.70 pence, or 3.1 percent, to 56.80
pence a therm as of 10:20 a.m. on the ICE Futures Europe
Exchange in London. That’s equal to $9.41 a million British
thermal units. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  Baseload power for next month gained 70 pence, or 1.4
percent, at 50.50 pounds a megawatt-hour. Baseload is delivered
around the clock.  Same-day gas rose 2.50 pence at 55 pence a therm. Power for
the next day gained 0.1 percent to 49.45 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Natural gas is used to generate about half of Britain’s
electricity and so the fuel price influences power markets.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report yesterday that
the continuing 30 million cubic meters a day of missing supply
from  Libya  and an increase of 18 million cubic meters a day in
liquefied natural gas demand from  Japan  following the earthquake
on March 11 “have the potential to eliminate the supply
overhang in the global LNG market, bringing it to balance.”  The bank raised its 2011 price estimate for U.K. gas at the
National Balancing Point delivery hub to $10.90 a million btu
from $7.80. It forecast a price of $12.40 a million Btu in 2012,
up from $8.50.  “Increased demand and the limited ability of LNG suppliers
to increase production levels will likely keep global LNG
markets more balanced this summer and increasingly tighter, in
our view, going forward,” analysts including  David Greely  said.  Britain is increasingly turning to tanker-borne gas
shipments as North Sea production declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
