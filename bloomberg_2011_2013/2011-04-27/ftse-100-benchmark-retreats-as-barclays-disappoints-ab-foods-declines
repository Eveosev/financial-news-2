Most U.K. stocks climbed, keeping
the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  near a two-month high, after a
rebound in the British economy in the first quarter outweighed
earnings at  Barclays Plc (BARC)  that disappointed investors.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  paced advancing shares after the
drugmaker posted results that beat analyst estimates.  Aggreko
Plc (AGK)  rallied 4.4 percent after saying profit this year will be
higher than in 2010. Barclays, Britain’s third-largest bank by
assets, tumbled 4.8 percent.  The FTSE 100 closed little changed at 6,068.16 as of 4:30
p.m. in London as two stocks rose for each one that fell.  Tesco
Plc (TSCO)  and  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  traded without the right to their
latest dividends, pulling the measure lower. The FTSE All-Share
Index was also almost unchanged while Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell
0.2 percent.  “The only game in town that was ever likely to get people
excited today was publication of the initial first-quarter U.K.
gross domestic product numbers,” said  Howard Wheeldon , a senior
strategist at BGC Partners in  London . The “numbers at least
place us back at square one on the so-called recovery jigsaw
board.”  U.K. GDP rose 0.5 percent from the final quarter of 2010
when it fell by the same amount, according to the  Office for
National Statistics  in London, amid the strongest surge in
service industry growth for four years. The increase matched
economists’ forecasts.  Glaxo Gains  Glaxo advanced 2.1 percent to 1,286.5 pence. The U.K.’s
biggest drugmaker reported a 14 percent increase in first-
quarter profit to 1.53 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), lifted by
a gain from the sale of its stake in Quest Diagnostics Inc.  Earnings excluding restructuring costs totaled 32.2 pence a
share, topping analysts forecast of 31.6 pence.  Aggreko jumped 4.4 percent to 1,786 pence after the world’s
largest provider of mobile power supplies said trading profit in
2011 will be “slightly” ahead of 2010.  Barclays limited gains in the FTSE 100, falling 4.8 percent
to 287.5 pence. Pretax profit at its investment banking unit
dropped 33 percent in the first quarter to 982 million pounds as
revenue declined 15 percent. The bank posted a 5 percent fall in
overall net income to 1.01 billion pounds which missed the
average analyst estimate of 1.21 billion pounds.  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  gained 1.9 percent to 3,324
pence after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said Unilever
Plc may pursue the maker of Lysol cleaners. Separately,
Citigroup Inc. advised clients to buy the stock in a note to
clients citing “compelling” valuations.  Bodycote, AB Foods  Bodycote Plc (BOY) , a supplier of metal-strengthening services to
Ford Motor Co., surged 13 percent to 380 pence after the company
forecast full-year operating profit toward the top end of
analysts’ forecast range. Numis Securities upgraded the shares
to “add.” Analysts at Arbuthnot also advised buying the stock.  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)  sank 5.8 percent to 984 pence,
the worst performance in the FTSE 100. The owner of Primark
clothes stores cut its full-year earnings forecast as
profitability at its clothing unit will be lower than
anticipated.  The company, which today reported an 8.6 percent increase
in first-half revenue, said adjusted earnings will be at a
similar level to last year. That compares with a November
forecast of “profit growth” for 2011.  ITV Plc (ITV)  dropped 3.9 percent to 72.75 pence after rival
British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc reached a new agreement to
broadcast most of the UEFA Champions League soccer matches until
summer 2015. ITV said it retained the rights to show a portion
of the games.  The shares also fell after Barclays lowered its
recommendation for ITV to “equal weight” from “overweight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
