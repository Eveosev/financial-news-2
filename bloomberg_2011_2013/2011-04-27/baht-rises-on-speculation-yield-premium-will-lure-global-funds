Thailand ’s baht strengthened to a
five-month high on speculation the difference in the nation’s
policy rate and those in advanced economies will draw fund
inflows.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against those
of six major trading partners, fell to the lowest level since
August 2008 as all 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted
the Fed will leave its key rate between zero and 0.25 percent at
a review today. Borrowing costs in Thailand are “too low if we
consider the trend of inflation,” central bank Deputy Governor
Atchana Waiquamdee said last week.  “It’s the dollar weakness as market players expect more
dovish comments from the Fed,” said Norawit Suparinayok, a
foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “In  Asia , we are
facing inflation and as the economy is strong, there are reasons
to raise policy rates. We expect some more capital inflows into
the region.”  The baht gained 0.2 percent to 29.93 per dollar as of 8:05
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency reached 29.81 earlier, the strongest level since Nov.
16. It may advance to 29.80 this week, Norawit said.  The Bank of Thailand lifted the one-day bond repurchase
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 percent last
week. Consumer prices rose 3.14 percent in March from a year
earlier, the most since August, according to official data.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, was little changed at
3.005 percent.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.29
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
