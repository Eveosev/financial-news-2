The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose
to the highest level in more than two weeks after U.S. consumer
confidence gained and companies including Daihatsu Motor Co.
reported earnings that beat forecasts.  Canon Inc. (7751) , which has lost 11 percent this year, jumped
after Nomura Holdings Inc. said the camera maker’s growth
prospects are “positive” even after last month’s record
earthquake and tsunami damaged supply chains. Daihatsu, an
automaker majority owned by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , leapt 6.5
percent.  Fanuc Corp. (6954)  advanced 3.6 percent after the maker of
factory robots forecast a 22 percent gain in first-half profit.  “The  U.S. economy  is recovering and corporate earnings are
strong,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in  Tokyo  at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “More and more manufacturers are
resuming operations at factories. That’s positive for stocks.”  The Nikkei rose 1.4 percent to 9,691.84 at the 3 p.m. close
of trading in Tokyo, the highest since April 11. The broader
Topix index gained 0.8 percent to 839.87, paring gains of as
much as 1.3 percent after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the country’s
sovereign-rating outlook, citing the cost of rebuilding from
last month’s disaster.  The Topix has lost 9.8 percent since a magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami on March 11 devastated  Japan ’s northeast
coast, crippling a nuclear power plant, and disrupting
production at companies from Toyota to chipmaker  Renesas
Electronics Corp. (6723)  Some 26,000 people are dead or missing.  Reconstruction Costs  S&P cut Japan’s debt outlook to “negative” from
“stable,” saying reconstruction costs are likely to add to a
government debt that is already the largest among developed
countries. S&P predicted rebuilding will cost as much as 50
trillion yen ($613 billion).  Canon jumped 7 percent to 3,740 yen, even after the company
cut its annual profit forecast by 29 percent. Nomura analyst
Tetsuya Wadaki said in a report yesterday that the worst is over
for the camera maker and high dividend yields along with the
mid-term growth outlook for single-lens reflex models make
shares attractive.  In the U.S., the Conference Board’s index of  consumer
confidence  rose to 65.4 in April from a revised 63.8 reading in
March, figures from the New York-based private research group
showed yesterday. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected an advance to 64.5.  Daihatsu, Kuraray  Federal Reserve policy makers began two days of meetings
yesterday, and will likely say they’ll complete a second round
of scheduled bond purchases worth $600 billion through the end
of June to help sustain the recovery. Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  hold his first press conference after the policy
decision.  Companies including Daihatsu and chemical-maker Kuraray Co.
jumped after reporting earnings. Daihatsu climbed 6.5 percent to
1,221 yen. The automaker said net income rose to 52.6 billion
yen in the year through March, exceeding the company’s forecast
by 19 percent.  Kuraray surged 11 percent to 1,178 yen after reporting
full-year profit rose 76 percent to 28.7 billion yen.  Fanuc climbed 3.6 percent to 13,260 yen. The company said
net income will increase 22 percent in the April-September
period. The projection is “positive” because the maker of
robots and control systems for  machine tools  tends to be
conservative in its forecasts, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in
a report published after the company’s announcement.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest
brokerage, had the biggest drop on the Nikkei. The company
posted a loss of 37.3 billion yen for the year ended March 31,
compared with a profit of 43.4 billion yen a year earlier. The
brokerage cut its dividend payments for the year to 6 yen from
13 yen. The stock tumbled 4.4 percent to 344 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758)  fell 2 percent to 2,366 yen after the
electronics maker warned customers who use its PlayStation
Network that credit-card data and other personal information may
have been stolen by a hacker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
