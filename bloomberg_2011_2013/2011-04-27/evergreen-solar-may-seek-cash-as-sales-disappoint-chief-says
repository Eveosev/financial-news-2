Evergreen Solar Inc. (ESLR) , a maker of
thin polysilicon wafers, said it may need to raise cash to
continue operations after first-quarter sales fell short of
expectations.  “Our near term liquidity has been negatively impacted and
may require us to secure additional sources of cash sooner than
expected,” Chief Executive Officer Michael El-Hillow said today
in a statement.  Evergreen held $38.5 million in cash and cash equivalents
at the end of the quarter ended April 2, and that fell to about
$33 million yesterday, the Marlboro, Massachusetts-based company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
