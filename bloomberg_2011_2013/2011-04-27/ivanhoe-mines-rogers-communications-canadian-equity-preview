Canadian stocks fell as wheat,
copper and oil futures declined before a U.S. Federal Reserve
policy announcement that may affect borrowing costs and investor
appetite for commodities.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer, lost 3.1 percent after Statistics  Canada 
forecast more planting of wheat.  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , an oil and gas
producer with operations on five continents, fell 1.3 percent
after missing analysts’ first-quarter profit estimates.  Teck
Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s biggest base-metals and coal producer,
decreased 3 percent as copper retreated.  “There’s a lot of concern about the inflation that’s
happening in food and energy,” said  Danielle Park , a partner at
Venable Park Investment Counsel Inc. in Barrie, Ontario, which
manages at least C$1 million ($1.05 million) each for more than
250 families. “That will be the area where any kind of
tightening at all will be the hardest hit.”  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index dropped 98.86
points, or 0.7 percent, to 13,810.24 at 11:11 a.m. in Toronto.  The S&P/TSX slipped 0.6 percent from the beginning of the
current earnings season on April 11 to yesterday, while the  S&P
500  advanced 1.7 percent. Fifty percent of S&P/TSX companies
that have reported financial results in the period have
surpassed their average analyst forecast, compared with 76
percent of S&P 500 companies.  The Fed is scheduled to release a statement on interest-
rate policy at 12:30 p.m. in  Washington , which will be followed
by a press conference with Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke .  Oil Inventories  Crude oil declined for a third day as the U.S. Energy
Department said inventories rose 6.16 million barrels last week,
more than three times the median forecast of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
lost 1.3 percent to C$42.36. Nexen decreased 1.3 percent to
C$23.24 after its earnings trailed the average of 14 analyst
estimates by 95 percent, excluding certain items.  Cenovus Energy
Inc. (CVE) , Canada’s fifth-biggest energy company, retreated 2.4
percent to C$35.37 after its first-quarter profit missed the
average analyst forecast by 24 percent, excluding certain items.  Potash Corp. declined 3.1 percent to C$53.84 as wheat
futures retreated. Canadian wheat planting will increase 17
percent this year,  Statistics Canada   forecast  today.  The company, based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, is to
release first-quarter financial results tomorrow.  Economis Stimulus  Copper futures fell as much as 2.2 percent in  New York  on
speculation the Fed may retreat from economic stimulus.  Teck dropped 3 percent to C$51.58.  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest publicly traded copper producer,
declined 2.1 percent to C$130.90.  Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN) , which
produces copper, gold and zinc, lost 3 percent to C$68.76.  Canada’s six largest banks each fell.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ,
the country’s third-biggest lender by assets, declined 0.7
percent to C$56.84.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , its largest rival,
slipped 0.6 percent to C$59.60.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  North
America ’s fourth-largest insurer, dropped for the first time in
six days, losing 1.6 percent to C$16.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
