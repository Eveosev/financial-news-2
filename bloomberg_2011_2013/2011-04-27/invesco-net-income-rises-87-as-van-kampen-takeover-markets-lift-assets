Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) , owner of the Invesco,
Van Kampen and PowerShares funds, fell short of analysts’
estimates after first-quarter profit increased 87 percent,
helped by the purchase of Morgan Stanley’s mutual-funds business
in June.  Net income rose to $177.5 million, or 38 cents a share,
from $95 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based
Invesco said in a statement today. Excluding some items,
earnings of 41 cents a share missed the 42-cent average estimate
of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “They continue to have underwhelming equity flows,” Doug Sipkin, an analyst in  New York  for Ticonderoga Securities LLC,
said in a telephone interview. Sipkin expected earnings of 42
cents a share.  Investors withdrew $2.8 billion from equity products in the
quarter even as the company reported $6.6 billion in net
deposits. Invesco’s Chief Executive Officer Martin L. Flanagan,
50, has made growth in Europe a priority for 2011 after raising
assets by $115 billion with the  Morgan Stanley (MS)  funds takeover.  The company fell as much as 3.5 percent in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. It was down 3 cents, to $24.82, at
4:02 p.m.  Invesco raised its quarterly dividend to 12.25 cents a
share from 11 cents, and said it repurchased 2.1 million shares
for $53.1 million in the first quarter.  ‘Retail Coming Back’  Assets under management rose 4.1 percent to $642 billion in
the three months ended March 31. The MSCI AC World Index of
stocks has increased 6.7 percent this year. The $1.37 billion
deal with Morgan Stanley, which included its Van Kampen unit,
helped push assets up 53 percent from a year earlier.  Almost half of new investments came from U.S. retail
customers, Chief Financial Officer Loren Starr said in a
telephone interview.  “The U.S. retail piece is definitely coming back and now
we feel we have an equal opportunity in  Europe ,” Starr said.  Flanagan wants to expand the European business by
increasing cross-border retail and institutional sales, he said
in an e-mail yesterday. Invesco owns Perpetual, the largest U.K.
money manager, and has operations in 12 European countries.  Distribution Fees  Revenue increased 43 percent from a year earlier to $1.03
billion, and expenses rose 38 percent to $802 million. While
investment management fees were in line with expectations,
distribution-related expenses and fees were off by $16 million,
reducing earnings by more than 2 cents a share, according to a
research note today by Daniel Fannon, a San Francisco-based
analyst at Jefferies & Co. Fannon expected earnings of 43 cents
a share.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , based in New York and the world’s largest
money manager, said April 21 that first-quarter net income rose
34 percent to $568 million, or $2.89 a share. Baltimore’s T.
Rowe Price Group Inc. said the same day that net income
increased 27 percent to $194.6 million, or 72 cents a share.  Invesco’s shares have risen 20 percent in the past year,
compared with the 7.4 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 17-
company index for asset managers and custody banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
