The European Commission adopted
rules on the allocation of free emissions allowances as of 2013.  “The decision sets out the rules including the benchmarks
of greenhouse-gas performance to be used by the member states in
calculating the number of allowances to be allocated for free
annually in these sectors,” the commission said today in a
statement in Brussels. “Although auctioning will become the
main principle for allocating allowances as of 2013, a
proportion of free allowances will still be given to industry
until 2020,” it said.  EU member states approved the benchmarking regulations in
December 2010. The rules were subject to three-month scrutiny by
the European Parliament and national governments, which raised
no objections and cleared the way for today’s official adoption.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
