(Corrects company managing fund in 2nd paragraph.)  Brazilian inflation-linked bonds
may appreciate as the country’s economy grows and its credit
profile improves, according to Alessandro Ghidini from Swiss &
Global Asset Management Ltd.  The real yield on inflation-linked bonds, whose principle
is adjusted to compensate for consumer price rises, may fall by
about 1 percentage point over the next year or so as the bonds
rise in value, Ghidini, who helps manage about $1.2 billion in
emerging-market debt for Swiss & Global, said in a phone
interview yesterday.  “ Brazil  is undergoing a tremendous improvement in terms of
the economy, in terms of debt profile,” Ghidini said.  The fall in yields may occur across all maturities for
Brazilian inflation-linked bonds, he said. A Brazilian
government inflation-linked bond due in August 2030 yielded 6.4
percent on top of inflation today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Brazil’s gross domestic product may expand by 4.5 percent
this year and its gross government debt remain stable at about
66 percent of GDP, according to the  International Monetary
Fund’s  World Economic Database in April.  The yield on Mexico’s 30-year inflation-linked bond may
also fall to 3.7 percent or 3.6 percent from about 4 percent
now, he said. Inflation-linked bonds from  South Korea  and  Turkey 
were less attractive investments at current prices, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
