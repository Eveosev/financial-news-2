Det Norske Veritas resumed full
business in  China  after authorities there reinstated licenses
that were withdrawn following the award of the Nobel Peace Prize
to a Chinese dissident, Aftenposten  reported , citing company
spokesman Aage Enghaug.  The Norwegian companyâ€™s business of certifying ships was
never affected, he told the Oslo-based newspaper. Many Norwegian
companies are still struggling to complete contracts in China
after the prize was awarded by the Oslo-based Nobel Peace Prize
body last year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
