Dutch banks and insurers are
vulnerable to possible problems in some emerging markets because
of their large investments there, according to the country’s
central bank.  “In the last two years investments in Poland, Brazil,
 China  and  South Africa  grew strongly,” the Amsterdam-based
bank, led by  Nout Wellink , said in its biannual financial
stability report today. Dutch banks, insurers and pension funds
“become more vulnerable to possible problems in these
countries.”  The Dutch regulator said there are signs of excessive
credit growth and overheating in China, Turkey and Brazil. The
fundamental causes of excessive liquidity should be dealt with
to prevent risks, such as asset-price bubbles, from
materializing, the bank said.  “As imbalances grow, it’s also clear that the limits of
accommodative monetary policy around the world have been
reached,” the bank said. The report was completed on April 12
and published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
