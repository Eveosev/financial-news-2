Citigroup Inc. (C)  is raising a loan
fund with a target size of about $400 million to be managed by
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , according to two people with knowledge of the
deal.  The collateralized loan obligation, BMI CLO I, is expected
to include a $259 million slice rated AAA by  Standard & Poor’s 
that has initial price guidance of 125 basis points, or 1.25
percentage point, more than the London interbank offered rate,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. Libor is a rate banks charge to lend to each other.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  The fund may also include a $27 million slice rated AA with
price guidance of 175 basis points more than Libor, and a $35
million slice rated A with pricing of 265 basis points more than
the benchmark, the people said. There is also a $22 million
slice rated BBB that pays 365 basis points more than Libor and a
$23 million BB piece of debt with a 525 basis-point spread,
according to the people. It also includes $41.7 million of so-
called equity, which takes the first losses if companies in the
pool of loans default, the people said.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is helping Citigroup
arrange the transaction, the people said.  Bobbie Collins, a BlackRock spokeswoman, and  Alexander
Samuelson , a Citigroup spokesman, didn’t immediately return
telephone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
