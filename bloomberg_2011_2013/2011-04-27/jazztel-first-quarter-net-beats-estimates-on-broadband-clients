Jazztel Plc (JAZ) , a Spanish phone
company, reported first-quarter net income that beat analysts’
estimates as sales soared, boosted by a growing base of
broadband customers.  Net income was 6.9 million euros ($10.1 million), compared
with a net loss of 3.5 million euros a year earlier, the company
said in a statement today. Sales climbed 28 percent to 175
million euros, while earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization more than doubled to 32.3 million
euros.  Jazztel, which has its main offices in Madrid, added 65,315
broadband clients during the first three months of 2011. The
company’s broadband customer base has reached more than 930,000
users, it said.  Jazztel was expected to report net income of 6.5 million
euros on Ebitda of 25.8 million euros, according to the average
analyst estimates from a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
