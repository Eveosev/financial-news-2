Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-
largest maker of construction equipment, posted a more than
threefold jump in fourth-quarter profit as  Asia ’s booming
economies boosted demand.  Net income climbed to 50.1 billion yen ($612 million) in
the three months ended March 31 from 15.2 billion yen a year
earlier, the Tokyo-based company said today in a statement.
Sales for the quarter rose 27 percent on-year to 541.1 billion
yen.  Industry demand for excavators will likely increase 20
percent to a record 273,000 units for the current financial year,
according to Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Japan’s second
largest producer. A recovery in the U.S., post-quake
reconstruction in Japan and strong economic growth in  China ,
 Indonesia  and other emerging markets are spurring demand.  The March 11 earthquake and tsunami pushed down its
operating profit by 7 billion yen in the fourth quarter because
of related costs and sales losses. Komatsu has now fully
restored operations at all its plants in the affected areas,
Chief Executive Officer Mikio Fujitsuka said today at a press
briefing.  Parts Supplies  Kobelco Construction Machinery Co., a unit of Kobe Steel
Ltd., is halting operations for as many as nine days this month
at its excavator plant in Hiroshima, western  Japan , and two days
in Ogaki city, central Japan, because it’s unable to secure
enough parts from quake-hit suppliers, Hiroaki Fujiwara, an
executive vice president of the Kobe-based steelmaker, told
reporters today in Tokyo.  Still, Komatsu sees “no big risks” of output disruption
from parts shortages this fiscal year if suppliers restart full
operations on schedule, Fujitsuka said.  The company said net income climbed to 150.8 billion yen in
the financial year ended March 31 from 33.6 billion yen a year
earlier. Profit for the current year will likely increase by a
third to 200 billion yen, close to the record posted for the
year ended March 2008.  Full-year sales rose 29 percent to 1.84 trillion yen. Sales
will likely increase 17 percent to 2.15 trillion yen for the
current year.  Shares in Komatsu rose 0.6 percent to close at 2,762 yen in
 Tokyo  trading, taking their gain to 12 percent since the
beginning of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
