A Peruvian congressional committee
approved a government proposal to increase the limit on private
pension fund managers’ investments overseas.  The measure calls for raising the limit gradually to 50
percent of the funds’ assets from 30 percent now, and seeks to
ease the pressure on the Peruvian economy caused by speculative
capital inflows, the committee said in an e-mailed statement
today. The increase will allow funds to diversify their risk,
the committee said.  Peru ’s central bank increased the limit on pension
investments abroad four times last year, to 30 percent from 22
percent, to help cool demand for the sol. Congressional approval
is required to raise the legal limit beyond 30 percent.  “The strength of demand for instruments in the local
market and scarcity of investment alternatives leads to the
concentration of investments in a few issuers,” Lorena Masias,
the banking regulator’s assistant superintendent of pension
funds, told the committee. “That’s why it’s a good idea to
raise the limit.”  Peru’s four private pension fund managers had 29 percent of
their assets invested overseas last month, according to the
regulator.  The measure will now go to the full congress for a vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
