Banco Santander SA (SAN)  is revising the
terms of the contracts of its 31 top executives to make it
harder for them to leave to work for rivals, Expansion reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The bank is adding a cause to the contracts so that the
executives cannot go to work for rival banks for a period after
they leave, the newspaper said. Another clause will hinder them
from taking other staff or clients with them if they go,
Expansion said.   Santander is imposing the contract changes weeks after the
departure of executives at its U.K. unit, including its head
Antonio Horta-Osorio, the newspaper said.
