Cyprus’s major banks have enough
capital to withstand a potential restructuring of Greek
government debt,  Central Bank of Cyprus  governor Athanasios Orphanides said.  Yields on  government securities  from  Greece , Ireland and
 Portugal  reached records this week. Lars Feld, a member of
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s council of economic advisers,
said Greece cannot avoid restructuring its debts.  “We carried out analyses and checked some scenarios and
our major banks have such a strong capital base that they may
withstand negative scenarios,” Orphanides told reporters in
Nicosia today. “Of course they would be affected. There’s no
way that there wouldn’t be a loss, which means that such an
eventuality would lead to losses for shareholders in the Cyprus
banks as it would lead to losses of shareholders in banks of
other countries in the euro area.”  He called restructuring a “a bad idea.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
