Asian currencies gained, led by
 South Korea ’s won, on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
signal its intention to keep U.S. interest rates low after a
policy meeting today, maintaining the region’s yield advantage.  Malaysia’s ringgit rallied to a 13-year high on speculation
its central bank will join  China , India, South Korea, Taiwan,
 Indonesia ,  Thailand  and the  Philippines  in raising rates this
year. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major trading partners, dropped to the lowest
since August 2008 ahead of the Fed meeting, at which all 83
economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the target rate will be
kept between zero and 0.25 percent.  The won climbed 0.6 percent to 1,079.45 per dollar as of
the 3 p.m. close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The ringgit strengthened 0.3 percent to 2.9791,
Indonesia’s rupiah rose 0.2 percent to 8,628, while the
Singapore dollar gained 0.1 percent to S$1.2325. China’s yuan
advanced 0.25 percent to 6.5127.  “It’s the dollar weakness as market players expect more
dovish comments from the Fed,” said Norawit Suparinayok, a
foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “In Asia, we are
facing inflation and as the economies are strong, there are
reasons to raise policy rates. We expect some more capital
inflows into the region.”  Benchmark rates in India and Indonesia are at 6.75 percent
and China’s is at 6.31 percent, compared with a maximum 0.1
percent in  Japan .  Faster Growth  The won strengthened by the most in a week as a report
showed economic growth quickened in the first quarter,
bolstering the case for another interest-rate increase after
inflation accelerated to a 29-month high of 4.7 percent in March,
official data show. Gross domestic product rose 1.4 percent from
the previous quarter, Bank of Korea said today.  The central bank boosted the benchmark seven-day repurchase
rate to 3 percent from 2.75 percent last month, the second
increase this year.  The ringgit gained for a sixth day. Bank Negara Malaysia,
which has kept its overnight rate at 2.75 percent since July
after raising it three times earlier in 2010, will meet to
review rates on May 5. Inflation in Southeast  Asia ’s third-
largest economy accelerated 3 percent in March, the fastest
since April 2009, the government said on April 20.  Dollar Weakness  “Risk appetite has surprisingly remained strong and
there’s still room for the ringgit to strengthen,” said Akira Banno, a treasury adviser in Kuala Lumpur at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. “With no change in the Fed policy rate, the
search for yields will continue” to favor Asian markets, he
said.  The yuan rose by the most in more than three months after
the People’s Bank of China set the currency’s reference rate
0.12 percent stronger than yesterday at 6.5096 per dollar, the
highest level since July 2005.  “The yuan fixing reflects the weakness in the dollar as we
are not going to see any signal on policy changes in the U.S.,”
said  Patrick Bennett , a Hong Kong-based strategist at Standard
Bank Group Ltd. “They’ll continue to keep rates at an extremely
low level while Asian economies are tightening.”  Elsewhere,  India ’s rupee gained 0.2 percent to 44.44
against the dollar and Thailand’s baht rose 0.1 percent to 29.97,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Philippine peso
advanced 0.2 percent to 43.215 and the Taiwan dollar
strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$28.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
