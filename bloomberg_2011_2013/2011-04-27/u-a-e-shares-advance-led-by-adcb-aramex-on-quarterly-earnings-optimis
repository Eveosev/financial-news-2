United Arab Emirates shares rose,
with Dubai’s benchmark surging the most in a month, as  Abu Dhabi
Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) ’s profit more than doubled, fueling
optimism earnings growth may exceed analysts’ estimates.  ADCB, the U.A.E. third-biggest bank by assets, surged to
the highest since October 2008. In Dubai, Aramex PJSC, the
Middle East’s largest courier company, increased 2.7 percent as
first-quarter profit rose 5 percent, helped by growth in Gulf
markets and acquisitions. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  climbed 1.9
percent, the most since March 20, to 1,666.06 at the 2 p.m.
close in Dubai. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  advanced 0.6
percent.  “ADCB is showing a healthy beat with its first-quarter
numbers providing a welcome shot in the arm,” said  Julian Bruce , equity sales head at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai.
“U.A.E. markets remain dominated by domestic retail players.”  First-quarter net income at ADCB, the company with the
fifth-heaviest weighting on  Abu Dhabi ’s index, advanced to 574.4
million dirhams ($156 million) from 218.6 million dirhams a year
earlier as loan-loss charges fell and fee income rose. The mean
estimate of four analysts was for a profit of 472.5 million
dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dubai Islamic  ADCB rallied 5.6 percent to 2.84 dirhams. The bank is one
of the biggest lenders to state-owned Dubai World, which signed
a final deal with creditors in March to restructure about $25
billion of debt. U.A.E. banks are recovering after the global
financial crisis slowed lending, hurt  investment banking  and led
to an increase in bad loans.  Dubai Islamic Bank rose 2.7 percent to 2.28 dirhams. The
lender with the second-heaviest weighting on the emirate’s gauge
may report a 44 percent increase in first-quarter profit to 289
million dirhams, according to the mean estimate of two analysts
on Bloomberg.  Aramex jumped the most since April 6 to 1.92 dirhams.
First-quarter profit climbed to 49.8 million dirhams from 47.5
million dirhams a year earlier.  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  increased 0.6
percent. Bahrain’s BB All Share Index gained 0.5 percent and
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  advanced 0.6 percent. Kuwait’s gauge and Oman’s
 MSM30 Index (MSM30)  slipped 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
