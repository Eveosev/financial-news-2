The U.K. Serious Fraud Office’s
general counsel will join U.S. law firm McGuireWoods LLP, adding
to the list of lawyers leaving for private practice as the
agency faces possible closure by the government.  Vivian Robinson will join the firm’s  London  office,
Richmond, Virginia-based McGuireWoods said in a statement today.
At least five other top lawyers have left the agency this year
as it faces dissolution under plans to create an economic crime
agency.  “I have been fortunate to have been there under the
leadership of  Richard Alderman , and hope that I have made some
contribution to the increased respect for and success of the
organization since he became director,” Robinson said in the
statement.  To contact the reporters for this story:
