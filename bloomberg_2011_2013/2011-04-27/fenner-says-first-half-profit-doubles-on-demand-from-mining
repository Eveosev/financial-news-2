Fenner Plc (FENR) , the world’s largest
conveyor-belt maker, said profit in the first half more than
doubled on demand from customers in the coal mining industry.  Net income in the six months to Feb. 28 rose to 17.6
million pounds ($29 million), or 9.1 pence a share compared with
8.4 million pounds, or 4.8 pence a share, the Hessle, northern
England-based company said in a Regulatory News Service
statement today. Revenue grew 35 percent to 332.5 million
pounds.  Demand from the coal mining industry boosted revenue in the
conveyor belt division which rose to 235.3 million pounds from
176.7 million pounds a year earlier, Fenner said.  “As we enter the second half, the performance is strong
and we are enjoying good levels of order book visibility,” the
company said in the statement. “This bodes well for the
seasonally stronger second half of the financial year in which
we expect to make further progress and continue to deliver
growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
