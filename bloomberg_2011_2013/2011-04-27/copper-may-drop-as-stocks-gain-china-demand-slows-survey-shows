Copper may fall on swelling
inventories of the metal and signs of weaker demand in  China ,
the world’s biggest consumer, a survey showed.  Ten of 16 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 63 percent, said prices will drop next week. Four
predicted a gain and two forecast little change. Copper for
delivery in three months was down 3.9 percent for this week at
$9,322 a metric ton at 5 p.m. yesterday on the London Metal
Exchange. The metal reached a record $10,190 a ton on Feb. 15.  LME copper stockpiles of 463,500 tons are at the highest
level in almost 11 months and up by a third from last year’s low
on Dec. 10. Imports of refined copper into China plunged 43
percent from a year earlier to 192,161 tons last month, customs
figures showed April 21.  Copper “remains under pressure from the increase in
exchange stocks and slowing Chinese buying,” David Threlkeld,
president of Resolved Inc., a copper trading company in
Scottsdale,  Arizona , said by e-mail April 26.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of April 21.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
64 of the past 134 weeks, or 48 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bearish: 10 Bullish: 4 Hold: 2  To contact the reporter on this story:
