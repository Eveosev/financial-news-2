The cost of insuring Japanese
government debt from non-payment was little changed after its
sovereign-rating outlook was cut to “negative” by  Standard &
Poor’s , according to traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts protecting the debt for five years fell 1.5 basis
points in early trading to 76.5 basis points and moved little
after S&P’s announcement, according to Deutsche Bank AG prices
as of 12:40 p.m. in  Tokyo .  The outlook on Japan’s AA- local-currency debt rating, the
fourth-highest grade, was lowered from “stable,” S&P said in a
statement today, as rebuilding from last month’s earthquake and
tsunami will likely add to the world’s biggest debt burden.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its debt obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt, and typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates. A basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
