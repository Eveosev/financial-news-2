Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the improvement in the U.S. labor market has been
“quite slow” and central bankers want to ensure job growth is
sustainable.  “The labor market is improving gradually,” Bernanke said
to reporters today during the first-ever press conference
following a Federal Open Market Committee meeting. “We would
like to make sure that is sustainable. The longer it goes on,
the more confident we are.”  “We are digging ourselves out of a deep hole,” Bernanke
said, referring to the jobs lost during the recession.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
