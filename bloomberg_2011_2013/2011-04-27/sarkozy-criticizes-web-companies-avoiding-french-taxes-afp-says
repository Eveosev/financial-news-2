French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said “it’s not normal” for Internet companies to pay taxes on
income earned in France in low-tax countries, Agence France
Presse said.  “Between that and a fiscal system that would penalize
employment, between nothing and too much, can’t we invent
something?” Sarkozy said in a speech to Internet executives in
Paris.  He didn’t mention any companies by name, AFP said.  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  and other Internet companies have their European
headquarters in Ireland, whose corporate tax rate is less than
half that of France’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
