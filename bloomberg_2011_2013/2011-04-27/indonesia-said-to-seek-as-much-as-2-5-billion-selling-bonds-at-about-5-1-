Indonesia ’s government is planning
to sell as much as $2.5 billion of 10-year dollar-denominated
bonds to yield 5.1 percent, according to four people familiar
with the matter who asked not to be identified because the
details are private.  Developing-nation debt offerings are off to a record start
after near-zero global  interest rates  and the Federal Reserve’s
quantitative easing fueled the biggest investor flows to
emerging-market bonds last year, based on data from EPFR Global.
Issuance of international debt from emerging markets climbed 10
percent to $262 billion in 2011 from a year earlier, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Indonesia had a budget deficit of
0.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2010.  “I like the credit,” said Lazlo Belgrado, a  fund manager 
at KBC Asset Management SA in Luxembourg. Indonesia has “strong
fundamentals. So for me this is still a buy in emerging-market
dollar debt,” he said.  The yield on Indonesia’s 5.875 percent U.S. dollar bond due
March 2020 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
4.81 percent as of 2:35 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The last time Indonesia sold 10-year dollar bonds was in
January 2010, at a yield premium over U.S. Treasuries of 228
basis points, according to Bloomberg data. The spread has since
narrowed to 169 basis points. Indonesia sold $2 billion of the
debt, and received orders for 2.3 times the amount on offer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
