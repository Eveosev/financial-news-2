Malaysia’s ringgit advanced for a
sixth day on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will take more
measures to support the  U.S. economy  when its bond-buying
program ends in June.  The currency rallied to the strongest level in more than 13
years on optimism  Bank Negara Malaysia  will raise borrowing
costs to cool the fastest inflation in two years. All 83
economists forecast the Fed will keep its target rate at between
zero and 0.25 percent today, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. Bonds gained after demand increased at a government debt
auction.  “The risk appetite has surprisingly remained strong and
there’s still room for the ringgit to strengthen,” said Akira
Banno, a treasury adviser in Kuala Lumpur at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. “With no change in the Fed policy rate, the
search for yields will continue” to favor Asian markets, he
said.  The ringgit strengthened 0.3 percent to 2.9790 per dollar
as of 4:15 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched 2.9755, the highest level since
September 1997, to cap a 3.3 percent gain this year.  The Fed unveiled a $600 billion bond-buying program in
November, known as quantitative easing, to keep borrowing costs
low in the world’s biggest economy. Policy makers will probably
indicate tomorrow that reinvestment of maturing securities will
continue beyond June,  Andrew Tilton , an economist at the primary
dealer Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in  New York , wrote in a report
this week.  Bank Negara will meet on May 5 to decide on  interest rates .
The central bank has kept its overnight policy rate at 2.75
percent since July, after lifting it three times earlier in
2010. Inflation in  Southeast Asia ’s third-largest economy
accelerated 3 percent in March, the fastest since April 2009,
the government said on April 20.  Bond Auction  Malaysia’s 10-year bonds yield 4.07 percent compared with
3.35 percent for similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, Bloomberg
data show. The yield gap has widened to as high as 75 basis
points, or 0.75 percentage point, from this year’s low of 31
basis points on Feb. 8.  The treasury sold 3.5 billion ringgit ($1.2 billion) of
Shariah-compliant notes maturing in April 2021 today at an
average yield of 4.17 percent. The bid cover ratio was 3.03
times, the highest of 12 debt auctions since August.  The yield on the securities fell more than 2 basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.145 percent after the auction,
according to Amanah Butler Sdn., the nation’s biggest debt
broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
