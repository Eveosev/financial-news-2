TNK-BP, the joint venture between
 BP Plc (BP/)  and a group of Russian billionaires, said first-quarter
earnings almost doubled on higher  oil prices  even as its
shareholders were caught up in a legal battle.  Net income advanced to $2.44 billion from $1.27 billion in
the year-earlier period,  Russia ’s third-biggest oil producer
said today in a statement.  “Despite disruptions at the shareholder level, TNK-BP
showed exceptionally strong performance in the first quarter of
2011”  Mikhail Fridman , interim chief executive officer and one
of the billionaire shareholders, said in the statement.  BP agreed in January to swap 5 percent of its own stock
for about 9.5 percent of state-run OAO Rosneft and set up an
Arctic exploration venture. Its billionaire partners in TNK-BP
won an injunction against the deal, saying it violated their
shareholder agreement. The next arbitration hearings are
scheduled for next week.  Urals crude prices for northwest  Europe  averaged $102.39 a
barrel in the first quarter of this year, about 36 percent
higher than a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Revenue climbed 35 percent to $13.8 billion and earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization surged 72
percent to $3.94 billion, the company said.  TNK-BP boosted oil and gas production by 2 percent to 1.77
million barrels a day, excluding a share in OAO Slavneft.
Liquids production gained 1 percent to 1.53 million barrels a
day.  Production growth was supported by the Uvat, Verkhnechonsk,
Rospan and Orenburg projects, TNK-BP said.  Refining throughput increased 7 percent to 774,000 barrels
a day, the oil producer said.  TNK-BP reduced net debt to $3.86 billion from $5.59 billion a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
