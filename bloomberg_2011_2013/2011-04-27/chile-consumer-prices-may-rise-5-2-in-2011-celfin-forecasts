Chile’s annual inflation may nearly
double in 2011 from last year as rising employment and  consumer
confidence  drive the economy to its fastest expansion in 15
years, Celfin Capital said  Consumer prices may rise 5.2 percent in 2011, the Santiago-
based brokerage said, before easing to 1.4 percent in 2012 while
the economy may grow 6.5 percent this year. Celfin previously
forecast 6.2 percent growth and 3.7 percent inflation for 2011.
Growth matching the brokerage’s forecast would be the fastest
since the 6.6 percent expansion in 1996.  Chile’s economy expanded faster than expected in the first
quarter of this year, and the higher employment and buoyant
consumer confidence driving that growth should continue, Celfin
said. Inflation may slow next year after the central bank raises
its benchmark interest rate to 6 percent by December 2011,
slowing economic growth, and as oil prices fall to $95 a barrel
in 2012 from $105 a barrel this year, the economists, led by
chief economist Mario Arend, wrote. Consumer prices in  Chile 
rose 3 percent in 2010.  “Inflation appears to us to be the most important risk for
the Chilean economy in 2011, given its potential effect on
consumers’ real income and on the central bank’s monetary policy
decisions,” they wrote.  Celfin changed its forecast for the peso to 505 per dollar
at year-end from 490. Earlier today, the peso reached a three-
year high of 460.95 per  U.S. dollar . At 12:34 p.m. New York
time, the peso traded at 462.33, a 0.1 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
