General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , the
No. 2 U.S. mall owner, said funds from operations rose in the
first quarter as occupancies at the company’s malls gained amid
a recovery in  consumer spending .  Funds from operations were $306.1 million, or 30 cents a
share, compared with $248.2 million, or 76 cents, a year
earlier, the Chicago-based company said today in a statement.
The per-share figure declined as the number of the shares
outstanding increased.  U.S. retail sales climbed in March for a ninth consecutive
month, the Commerce Department reported April 13. General
Growth’s mall occupancies rose 40 basis points to 92.4 percent,
and tenant sales gained 7.3 percent to $457 a square foot on a
trailing one-year basis.  General Growth’s core FFO, which excludes such items as
results from discontinued operations and interest expense on
repaid debt, totaled 22 cents a share. The company was expected
to have FFO of 23 cents a share, the average estimate of 10
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  FFO, a cash-flow measure used by real estate investment
trusts, excludes depreciation and other items and doesn’t
conform to generally accepted accounting principles.  General Growth filed for Chapter 11 protection in April
2009 after weighing itself down with $27 billion in debt that it
was unable to refinance because of the credit crisis and
collapse of the commercial mortgage-backed  securities market . It
emerged from bankruptcy in November.  First-quarter results were announced after the close of
regular U.S. trading. General Growth shares rose 5 cents to
$15.99 as of 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The company has investment and management stakes in 169
malls in 43 U.S. states.  Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , the only U.S. mall owner larger
than General Growth, plans to report its first-quarter results
on April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
