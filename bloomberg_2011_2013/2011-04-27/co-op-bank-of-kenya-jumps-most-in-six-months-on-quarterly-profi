Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd. (COOP) ,
the countryâ€™s fourth-biggest bank by assets, rose the most in
six months after first-quarter profit jumped 58 percent.  The lender surged 1.05 shillings, or 6 percent, to 18.54
shillings at 12:06 p.m. in Nairobi, the biggest intraday jump
since October 2010.  Net income advanced to 1.64 billion shillings ($19.6
million) in the three months to March 31, from 1.04 billion
shillings in the same period a year earlier. Net interest
income, the difference between what a bank pays out for deposits
and charges for loans, climbed 46 percent to 2.85 billion
shillings, Co-operative Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
