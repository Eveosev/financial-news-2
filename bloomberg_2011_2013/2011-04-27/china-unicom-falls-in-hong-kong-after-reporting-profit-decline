China  Unicom ( Hong Kong ) Ltd., the
nation’s second-largest mobile-phone company, fell in Hong Kong
trading after reporting an 86 percent decline in first-quarter
profit, missing analysts’ estimates.  Unicom slid 2 percent to HK$15.44 as of 11:06 a.m. on the
city’s stock exchange, after falling as much as 4.1 percent. The
Beijing-based company’s net income plunged to 166 million yuan
($25.4 million) from 1.21 billion yuan last year. The median of
four analysts’ estimates was for profit of 1.13 billion yuan,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “The first-quarter result was very disappointing and we
expected the stock to come off more,” Michael Meng, an analyst
at Bank of China Ltd., said by phone today.  Unicom’s expenses increased as it tried to attract users to
its third-generation phones and to sell service contracts for
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone in China, the world’s biggest phone market.
Subsidies for 3G handsets increased to 1.9 billion yuan from 100
million yuan a year earlier, as the mobile-phone operator
boosted subscribers for its high-speed service by 31 percent to
18.5 million, the company said.  “Investors’ views are polarized” between the company’s
market share and its operating costs, said Meng, who downgraded
the shares to “sell” from “hold.”  Unicom is the only carrier in China that offers the iPhone
with a service contract. China  has  1.2 billion phone users,
according to government data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
