Kenyan Prime Minister  Raila Odinga 
proposed removing duties on wheat and corn imported by private
companies and eliminating taxes on kerosene to cushion the
impact of rising prices.  Kenya ’s annual inflation in March accelerated for the fifth
consecutive month to 9.2 percent, prompting the  central bank 
last month to unexpectedly increase the benchmark interest rate
by a quarter of a percentage point to 6 percent.  “Kenyans are experiencing a very sharp rise in the cost of
living,” Odinga said in parliament today in the capital,
Nairobi. “The increased food prices are responsible for 60
percent of the total inflation.”  Rising global commodity prices are passing through to the
Kenyan market, where an “emerging drought” has hit domestic
crop production and affected the local  food supply , Odinga said.
Four million people threatened by famine will receive assistance
from the government, while secondary-school fees have been
waived in drought-hit regions of the East African nation, Odinga
said.  Higher international crude prices have also stoked
inflationary pressures in Kenya, he said.  Lawmakers will be asked “as soon as possible” to consider
a proposal to reduce kerosene taxes by a further 5.66 shillings
(7 U.S. cents) per liter, following a 2 shilling-per-liter cut
announced by the  Finance Ministry  last week, Odinga said.  The government plans to announce an increase to the
country’s minimum wage on May 1, Labor Day, to offset rising
household costs, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
