Cotton growers in western  Burkina
Faso  have threatened to boycott the crop season over a price for
the fiber they say is too low, Abdoulaye Tani, president of the
Houet Cotton Producers’ Committee, said.  The group, which has about 500 members, are also upset
about the rising cost of fertilizer, he said by phone from the
city of Bobo Dioulasso today.  Burkina Faso , sub-Saharan  Africa ’s biggest cotton producer,
raised the minimum price farmers will be paid for their crop in
the 2011-12 harvest by 35 percent to 245  CFA francs  ($0.55) per
kilogram, Ali Compaore, the head of a Burkinabe cotton-industry
association, said yesterday.  “We are not satisfied with this price because it does not
take into account the international market price,” Tani said,
asking for the minimum price to be set at 500 francs per
kilogram.  Cotton prices in  New York  have almost doubled in the past
year because of a global shortage of the fiber. It dropped for a
third straight day, declining 3.6 percent to $1.546 per pound.  Not all of Burkina Faso’s growers support the call for a
boycott, said Karim Traore, president of a national cotton
farmers’ union that he said has about 8,000 members.  “Many farmers called us to say that they will not sign” a
petition planned by the Houet growers’ group, Traore said by
phone.  The demand to pay 500 francs for a kilogram of Burkinabe
cotton is “not realistic,” said Celestin Tiendrebeogo, chief
executive officer of Sofitex, the country’s largest cotton
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
