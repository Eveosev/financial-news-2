Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S.
wireless provider, said a connection problem with its fourth-
generation network is preventing some mobile phones and other
devices from accessing Internet services properly.  “Customers are temporarily unable to activate any 4G LTE
devices,” Jeffrey Nelson, a Verizon Wireless spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement, referring to the carrier’s long-term
evolution network.  The company has been rolling out the faster network to
boost sales of data plans and draw new customers. The carrier
last month introduced its first 4G handset, the  HTC Corp. (2498) 
ThunderBolt. Customers can also use the 4G network to connect
laptops to the Internet.  While the glitch affects data services, people with 4G
handsets are still able to make voice calls, Nelson said. He
said Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based  Verizon Wireless  is working
with vendors to restore service to affected customers and
expects service to be restored market-by-market, without
providing details.  Verizon’s third-generation network, on which the  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
iPhone and Motorola Droid X handsets run, isn’t affected, said
Nelson.  The carrier said April 21 it sold more than 500,000 4G
devices, including 260,000 ThunderBolts, in less than a month
during the first quarter.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , which co-owns the wireless
carrier with  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , added 62 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $38.25 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have gained 6.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
