Chinese small-company stocks will
extend the steepest two-day drop in three months as more
companies miss profit estimates amid government tightening, said
GF Fund Management Co., China’s sixth-biggest asset manager.  The  CSI Smallcap 500 Index (SH000905)  fell 1.2 percent to 4,913.50 at
the 3 p.m. close. The measure slumped 1.7 percent yesterday,
capping a two-day, 3.8 percent retreat that’s the most since
Jan. 18. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  of larger companies lost 2.1 percent
during the same two-day period. The ChiNext index of start-up
companies dropped to the lowest since October.  Earnings per-share at the 358 companies that have released
first-quarter earnings in the 500-member small-cap index trailed
analysts’ estimates by 14 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank has raised banks’ reserve-
requirement ratio 10 times since the start of 2010, while
boosting  interest rates  four times to cool inflation.  “Earnings expectations for small caps were too high and
many of them failed to meet expectations,” said Chen Shide, a
Guangzhou-based manager of small-cap stocks at GF Fund, which
oversees about $15.9 billion. “Small caps definitely haven’t
reached a bottom yet. Investors are now beginning to pay for
ramping up share prices over the past two years.”  The CSI Smallcap 500 jumped 155 percent from the end of
2008 to the start of 2011, driving its valuation to a two-year
high of 39.5 times estimated earnings in December 2009. Stocks
surged on the prospect the government would provide financial
support to smaller industries that would drive economic growth
such as alternative energy. The index had added 0.7 percent this
year through yesterday, lagging behind a 3.3 percent advance for
the CSI 300.  Stock Valuations  Companies traded on the small-cap gauge are valued at 28
times estimated earnings, almost twice the CSI 300’s multiple of
14.5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average gap
between the two gauges is 47 percent over the past four years,
the data showed.  “Small caps are still expensive and the current level may
not be the valuation bottom,” said Jin Run, a Shanghai-based
strategist at Guotai Junan Securities Co.,  China ’s second-
largest brokerage by revenue.  China’s stocks fell yesterday on concern credit growth may
slow, making it harder for smaller companies to obtain loans.
The nation’s banking regulator set capital targets for the
nation’s five biggest lenders above the minimum 11.5 percent
ratio amid concern that credit risks may rise, three people with
knowledge of the matter said.  “It’s not the year of small caps,” said Chen, whose
company is ranked the sixth-largest asset manager by Howbuy, a
funds tracker. “They’ll suffer more amid the monetary
tightening.”  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
