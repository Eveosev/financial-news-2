China  Coal Energy Co., the nation’s
second-largest coal producer, posted a 16 percent gain in first-
quarter profit as prices rose and demand for the fuel increased.  Net income climbed to 2.30 billion yuan ($353 million), or
0.17 yuan a share, from 1.98 billion yuan, or 0.15 yuan, a year
earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a statement to the
 Hong Kong  stock exchange today, citing domestic accounting
standards. Sales jumped 34 percent to 20.9 billion yuan.  China’s economy  expanded 9.7 percent in the first three
months, beating a forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists
for growth of 9.4 percent and boosting demand for energy and raw
materials. China Coal increased the selling price of the
commodity by 5 percent in the first quarter compared with a year
earlier, data from the statement showed.  Production rose 5 percent to 25.9 million metric tons in
January to March, according to the statement.  The coal producer is seeking to raise 150 billion yuan to
finance projects through 2015 to expand reserves, Chief
Financial Officer Weng Qing’an said on March 24.  China Coal will focus on coal exploration in the next five
years while developing its coal-to-chemicals and power
generation businesses to diversify income sources, Board
Secretary Zhou Dongzhou said last month.  The shares have fallen 13 percent in Hong Kong trading in
the past year, compared with the 12 percent gain in the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index . China Coal dropped 0.6 percent to
HK$10.36 today, before the earnings announcement.  China will rely on coal to meet more than half of its
energy needs by 2015 even as the government increases the use of
cleaner-burning fuels, data from the National Energy
Administration show.  -- Wang Ying . Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
