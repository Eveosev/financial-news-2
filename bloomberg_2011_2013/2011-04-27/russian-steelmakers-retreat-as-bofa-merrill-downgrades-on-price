Russian steel producers OAO
Severstal, OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel and OAO Novolipetsk
Steel retreated after Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut their
ratings to “neutral” from “buy,” saying prices had peaked.  “We believe that steel prices have peaked for the year and
that investor sentiment towards the sector will thus turn
cautious in the near term,” Eduard Faritov and Stanislav
Gorozhankin wrote in a report e-mailed today.  Severstal,  Russia ’s largest steelmaker, dropped for a third
day, falling 2.4 percent to 514.9 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close
in Moscow. The company had its price estimate reduced to $19.50
from $24.50. Magnitogorsk’s target was cut to $13.70 from
$22.80. The shares slid 2.1 percent to 27.599 rubles.  Novolipetsk declined for a fourth day, retreating 2 percent
to 108.43 rubles after the price was lowered to $43.30 from
$50.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
