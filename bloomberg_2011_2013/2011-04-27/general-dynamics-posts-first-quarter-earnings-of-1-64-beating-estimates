General Dynamics Corp. (GD) , the maker
of Abrams battle tanks and Gulfstream jets, said first-quarter
profit rose 3.5 percent, aided by higher margins at the
business-jet unit.  Net income increased to $618 million, or $1.64 a share,
from $597 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier, the  Falls
Church , Virginia-based company said today in a statement. The
average of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for $1.61 a
share. Sales gained less than 1 percent to $7.8 billion.  General Dynamics’s defense business was dealt a setback
after U.S. Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  proposed in January to
cancel the company’s Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle it was
building for the Marine Corps. The loss may be offset with
Gates’s proposal to upgrade Abrams tanks and the Army’s Stryker
vehicles, both made by the company.  With U.S. defense spending coming under pressure, Chief
Executive Officer Jay Johnson has said the Gulfstream unit will
remain the company’s “growth engine.”  “In this pressured budget environment, it is very likely
the case the defense top line spending will begin a slow steady
decline,” Johnson said on a conference call today. “The
programs most at risk are likely to be the new development
programs” and the company is “well positioned” to sustain
business in Army and Navy programs as well as in its Aerospace
unit, he said.  Profit Forecast  General Dynamics, which also makes Virginia-class nuclear
submarines, in January forecast full-year profit of $7 to $7.10
a share. Analysts’ average estimate is for profit of $7.12 a
share on sales of $33.8 billion.  General Dynamics rose 8 cents to $72.72 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 2.5 percent
this year. The Standard and Poor’s Supercomposite Aerospace &
Defense Index has gained 10.5 percent in the same period.  Operating profit at the Aerospace unit, maker of the
Gulfstream jets, rose 5.5 percent to $230 million, General
Dynamics said. Sales at the unit declined less than 1 percent to
$1.35 billion.  An April 2 crash of the company’s new G650 model jet during
a test flight that killed its four-member crew has led to
suspension of all tests while U.S. agencies investigate.  Combat Systems sales fell 2.3 percent to $1.96 billion and
operating profit gained 3 percent to $277 million. Revenue at
the Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology units
rose 2.3 percent each to $1.68 billion and $2.82 billion
respectively.  Profit at the Information Systems unit fell 4.8 percent to
$276 million and Marine profits increased 3 percent to $167
million, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
