Soon after Indiana state Senator Ed Charbonneau introduced legislation in January to bolster cash-
strapped cities on the verge of bankruptcy, he got an unexpected
phone call.  It was Bill Cooper, city manager of Hamtramck, Michigan,
whose own state has refused permission for the  Detroit  suburb to
file for reorganization. Cooper urged sending state help to
cities before they reach a crisis, Charbonneau said.  “We’re putting a process in place with the intent of
avoiding the need for bankruptcy,” Charbonneau, a Valparaiso
Republican, said in a telephone interview April 19. “The whole
purpose of it is to try to get fiscal help to distressed local
units of government so they can correct their situation before
any need for bankruptcy would arise.”  Insurmountable budget deficits gripping some U.S. cities
are prompting state intervention to avert municipal bankruptcies
through mechanisms to renegotiate labor contracts, devise
financial plans and pay debts. Cities face an estimated $20
billion in combined shortfalls this year, according to the
 National League of Cities , a Washington-based lobbying group.  States are also pressing their cities to resolve fiscal
troubles before they get out of hand, heeding lessons learned
from the 2008 bankruptcy of Vallejo,  California , which has spent
about $10.6 million in legal fees and still had to slash its
police and fire departments by more than 40 percent.  Weighing Legislation  Indiana and California are among states weighing
legislation to head off such bankruptcies following similar
efforts last year in  Rhode Island . In Michigan, Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, signed a law last month empowering a
state-appointed emergency manager to renegotiate a city’s
contracts, sell assets and set minimal staffing levels.  The  Michigan  managers will develop a financial and
operating plan for a distressed local government that includes
meeting scheduled debt service on all bonds, notes and municipal
securities, making pension-fund contributions and changing,
rejecting, ending and renegotiating contracts.  The bills aim to protect states from the harm to their
credit ratings that could result from a municipal bankruptcy,
increasing their borrowing costs, said  James Spiotto  of the
Chicago-based law firm Chapman and Cutler LLP.  “It’s a responsible trend,” Spiotto said in a telephone
interview April 20. Often in such situations, cities “need a
bridge, they need additional revenues to weather the storm, and
that’s what the state provides,” he said.  Emergency Manager  In  Indiana , Charbonneau’s bill would allow a troubled
municipality to seek state appointment of an emergency manager
with broad powers over city finances, including reviewing
budgets and salaries, creating a plan to repay debts,
renegotiating labor contracts, representing the city in
collective bargaining, and reducing or suspending salaries. The
manager would also be empowered to make, approve or reject a
contract, expense or loan.  Indiana’s House of Representatives approved the proposal on
April 21, sending it to a conference committee to resolve
differences with the Senate version of the bill, Charbonneau’s
office said in a news release.  “To the extent that they are helpful in improving local
government budget management and overall performance, they’ve
been a positive development from a credit standpoint,” Robin Prunty, a credit analyst at New York-based  Standard & Poor’s ,
said of such legislative moves in a phone interview April 20.  In California, lawmakers are considering legislation that
would require a distressed municipality to attempt renegotiating
financial and contractual obligations with investors and public
employees, through mediation, before considering a bankruptcy
filing.  ‘Struggling’ Cities  “A lot of cities are struggling, but parties are not
talking all together,” Assemblyman Bob Wieckowski, a Fremont
Democrat and bankruptcy attorney, said in a telephone interview
April 19. “My legislation would appoint a third party, someone
who is skilled in bankruptcy work and would be the adult in the
room.”  Two days after cash-strapped Central Falls, Rhode Island,
filed for appointment of a state receiver in May 2010, Standard
& Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the city’s
general-obligation debt to junk. State legislators responded by
enacting a law setting up a process to help cities stabilize
their finances. The law allows appointment of a fiscal overseer
to develop an operating and capital plan to help a city recover.  If the overseer determines the city can’t balance its
budget or faces a fiscal crisis, the state revenue director may
appoint a budget commission. If the budget commission can’t
restore stability, a receiver is appointed and can file a
federal Chapter 9 bankruptcy petition for the city.  Bond Obligations  When a city can’t meet its bond obligations, the state’s
treasurer would make the payments and deduct the amount from
future funds due the city, according to a  statement .  Michigan this month began building an army of emergency
managers for troubled municipalities by offering training for
financial professionals and public employees. As many as 400
accountants, lawyers, school workers and city staffers are
taking classes on topics including negotiating contracts and
dealing with a unionized workforce.  Michigan already has emergency managers running schools in
Detroit and overseeing the cities of Pontiac, Ecorse and  Benton
Harbor . Hamtramck, which had such a manager in the past, has
sought to reorganize under Chapter 9 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy
Code , saying that Detroit, which largely surrounds it, owes it
money. In March 2010, Detroit said it was considering moving
toward a filing.  State Safeguards  Michigan is not the only state with safeguards already in
place.  In  Pennsylvania , officials use the law known as Act 47 to
offer loans and grants to financially distressed local
governments and help in creating a recovery plan. The state has
declared 26 municipalities to be distressed since the law was
enacted in 1987, according to the  Department of Community and
Economic Development .  Among them is Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania capital with a
debt burden at least five times its general-fund budget.
Consultants hired under Act 47 said they’ll propose a recovery
plan in May. Harrisburg Controller Dan Miller said in a report
this month he expects a $6 million deficit this year.  -- With assistance from  Jeff Green  in Southfield, Michigan,
