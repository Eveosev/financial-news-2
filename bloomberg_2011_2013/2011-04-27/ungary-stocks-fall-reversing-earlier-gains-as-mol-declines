Hungarian shares reversed gains as
Mol Nyrt., the country’s largest refiner, declined on
speculation potential sanctions against  Syria  may crimp its
production plans.  The benchmark BUX index of shares dropped 0.2 percent to
24,111.03 by the 5 p.m. close in Budapest, after rising as much
as 0.9 percent. Mol, which accounts for more than 30 percent of
the index’s weightings, slumped 1.2 percent to 24,250 forint,
the biggest daily drop since April 18.  Syria’s increasingly violent suppression of anti-government
protests prompted United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
to call for an external inquiry, while the U.S. is considering
“targeted sanctions,” said Jake Sullivan, director of policy
planning at the State Department.  “Syria represents one of the most important sources of
hydrocarbon production growth for Mol,” Peter Csaszar, an
equity analyst at KBC Securities, said by phone from Budapest.
Any serious threat to sourcing oil from Syria is “very negative
for Mol,” Csaszar said.  A global rally in stocks stalled in the U.S., with the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropping from an almost three-year
high, as losses in commodity shares overshadowed rising
earnings. Crude oil futures extended declines after a U.S.
government report showed a larger-than-forecast increase in
inventories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
