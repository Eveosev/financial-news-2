Huawei Technologies Co.,  China ’s
largest phone-network equipment maker, aims to more than triple
annual sales to about $100 billion in the next five to 10 years
as it expands into cloud computing and small-business networks.  Huawei forecasts sales this year will climb to 199 billion
yuan ($31 billion) from 185.2 billion yuan last year, Richard
Yu, chief marketing officer, said in  Shanghai  today.  “Traditional industry boundaries are blurring and the
telecommunications industry will be redefined in the next 10
years,” Yu said at the meeting with analysts and media. “Low-
cost, huge-capability networks will be the industry
requirement.”  Chief Executive Officer Ren Zhengfei, who founded Huawei in
1987, built it into the world’s second-largest maker of
equipment for mobile-phone networks, behind Ericsson AB. After
starting off in China’s rural communications market and then
expanding that strategy through Asia and  Africa , Ren is now
looking to boost sales in  Europe  and the U.S. to further close
the gap with its Swedish rival.  Huawei , based in Shenzhen, southern  Guangdong province ,
held about 15.7 percent of the $78.6 billion global market for
carrier network infrastructure last year, second to Ericsson’s
19.6 percent share, according to estimates from research firm
Gartner Inc. on April 11.  Growth Areas  Huawei will increasingly look to expand beyond the
traditional phone-network market because of limited growth
prospects in that business, Yu said. This year’s sales growth
will be less than half the 24 percent increase in revenue last
year as the company faces challenges including yuan
appreciation, a shortage of labor and accelerating inflation,
Vice President Fan Chen said at the same event.  “The traditional telecom industry market will have a
growth in volume that can only support our expansion to about
$40 billion in annual revenue,” Yu said. “So we are looking to
expand our business with enterprise, devices and cloud
computing.”  Huawei is targeting annual sales at its enterprise group,
which sets up computer and communication networks for businesses
and government agencies, to expand to as much as $20 billion
within five years, from $2 billion last year, according to Yu.
Handset sales may increase to $20 billion in the same period
from $5 billion last year, he said.  The company still wants to maintain leadership in its
traditional business with telecommunications carriers, he said.
Huawei may have $6 billion in handset sales this year, and aims
to be among the top five makers by 2013, Victor Xu, chief
marketing officer for devices, said today.  Overseas Sales  Huawei, which didn’t win its first contract outside China
until 1997, achieved international sales of more than $100
million by 2000. Overseas business exceeded contracts in China
for the first time in 2005, according to the company’s website.  Growth in overseas sales raised Huawei’s total revenue to
185.2 billion yuan last year, the company said in its annual
report released this month, or about $27.36 billion based on the
average  exchange rate  for the yuan to the dollar last year. That
compares with Ericsson’s $28.3 billion in sales last year at the
equivalent average exchange rate.  Huawei got 65 percent of its revenue from outside of China
last year, up from 60 percent in 2009, according to the report.
Overseas sales jumped 34 percent at Huawei to 120.4 billion yuan
last year, according to the report.  Its sales in China gained 9.7 percent to 64.8 billion yuan.
China accounted for 35 percent of the company’s sales last year,
down from 40 percent in 2009. Net income rose 30 percent to 23.8
billion yuan, from 18.3 billion yuan a year earlier, Huawei’s
report said.  The company is owned by its employees and the Chinese
government holds no shares, according to its website. The
company employs 110,000 worldwide, the annual report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
