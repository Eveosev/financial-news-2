European stocks erased their
decline after a report showed Britainâ€™s economy rebounded in the
first quarter by enough to erase the contraction of the previous
three months.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained less than 0.1 percent to
281.3 at 9:40 a.m. in  London , having earlier dropped as much as
0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
