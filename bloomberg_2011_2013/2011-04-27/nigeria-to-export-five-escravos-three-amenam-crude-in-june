Nigeria , a favored supplier of oil
to U.S. refiners, plans to ship five cargoes of Escravos crude
in June, one less than in May, according to a loading schedule
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Africaâ€™s largest producer will also export three Amenam,
three EA, one Antan, one Okwori and one Oso, the plan showed.  Loading programs released so far show that Nigerian will
export at least 68 cargoes in June, including 12 Qua Iboe, seven
 Bonny Light , five Akpo, eight Agbami, five Bonga, five Erha,
seven Escravos, three Yoho and two Okono shipments. For the same
number of grades the country will ship 65 consignments in May.  Export plans of Brass River, Abo and Pennington have yet to
be released. Each cargo ranges from 500,000 barrels to 1 million
barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
