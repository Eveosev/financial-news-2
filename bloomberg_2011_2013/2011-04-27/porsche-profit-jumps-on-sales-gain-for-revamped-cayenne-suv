Porsche SE’s car-making division
reported a first-quarter profit gain after a revamp of the
Cayenne boosted demand for the sport-utility vehicle.  Earnings before interest and tax “more than doubled” to
496 million euros ($728 million), the Stuttgart, Germany-based
company said in a statement today, without providing a year-
earlier figure. Sales rose 10 percent to 2.28 billion euros.  Luxury-car makers, including Bayerische Motoren Werke AG
and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, are anticipating record demand
this year, boosted by growing wealth in  China  and rebounding
spending in the U.S. Porsche, which is combining with  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) , aims to double global sales to about 200,000 cars by 2018 by
adding models such as a compact SUV and increasing sales in
emerging markets.  The Cayenne, Porsche’s best-selling model, increased sales
62 percent to 11,487 vehicles in the first quarter following the
introduction last year of the third generation of the model.
Deliveries of the four-door Panamera fell 5.5 percent to 4,715,
while the 911 sports car declined 17 percent to 4,750.  Porsche AG, the car-making unit, released first-quarter
results for the first time after shifting to calendar-year
reporting to align its operations with Wolfsburg, Germany-based
VW. Porsche’s fiscal year previously ended on July 31.  Porsche SE, which sold 49.9 percent of the car-making
business to VW, raised 4.9 billion euros in a rights offering
earlier this month. The share sale will be used to cut debt and
facilitate the merger with VW. The two companies agreed to merge
in 2009 after Porsche racked up more than 10 billion euros in
debt in its failed effort to gain control of VW. Porsche SE
holds 51 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  The merger, which was slated for the second half, will
probably be delayed until next year because of German legal
obstacles, including an investigation into share-price
manipulation allegations, Porsche said Feb. 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
