The U.S. has more oil equivalent
than  Saudi Arabia  when including reserves of natural gas,  T. Boone Pickens , the billionaire energy investor, said today in an
interview on CNBC.  Production of gas from shale formations is “getting there
pretty fast,” said Pickens, chairman of BP Capital LLC in
Dallas.  Further unrest in the Middle East could send oil prices
higher, Pickens said. “If the Saudi’s go down, you’re looking
at $300 to $400 oil,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
