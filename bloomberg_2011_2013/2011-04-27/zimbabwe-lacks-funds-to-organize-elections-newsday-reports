Zimbabwe doesnâ€™t have the $400
million needed to organize elections that President  Robert Mugabe  plans to hold this year, Newsday reported, citing Finance
Minister Tendai Biti.  The government, which had a revenue target of $2.7 billion
in the 2011 budget, is missing monthly targets and faces a $150
million deficit this year, the Harare-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
