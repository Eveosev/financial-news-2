Volvo AB (VOLVB)  and  Scania AB (SCVB) , two of
 Europe ’s biggest commercial-vehicle manufacturers, reported a
surge in first-quarter profit as heavy-truck demand rebounds.  Volvo’s net income more than doubled to 4.09 billion kronor
($670 million), the Gothenburg, Sweden-based company said today.
Scania, the Swedish truckmaker controlled by Volkswagen AG, said
profit rose 77 percent to 2.51 billion kronor.  The increase in purchases from freight companies prompted
Volvo, the world’s second-largest truckmaker, to raise its
industry forecast for heavy truck sales in North America and
Europe. Vehicle makers are adding capacity after slashing jobs
and slowing production as the economic slowdown following the
2008 financial crisis sapped sales.  “Europe and North America are coming on very strong,
albeit from low levels,” Volvo Chief Executive Officer Leif Johansson said today in an interview. “We still have a very
good pace in  China , Brazil and  India . The investments we made
there a few years ago have really paid off.”  Volvo rose as much as 4.90 kronor, or 4.3 percent, to
118.50 kronor and was up 2.4 percent to 116.30 kronor as of 1:19
p.m. in  Stockholm  trading. The stock has fallen 1.9 percent this
year, valuing the company at 248 billion kronor. Scania shares
were 1.1 percent lower.  Volvo, the maker of Mack vehicles in the U.S. and Renault
trucks in Europe, today predicted deliveries in a range of
230,000 to 240,000 vehicles in both regions. Volvo’s previous
forecast was for sales of 220,000 units in each area.  Surging Demand  March deliveries of trucks weighing more than 16 tons rose
58 percent in Europe to 23,340 vehicles, marking the strongest
monthly demand for new vehicles in more than two years, the
Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association
said today. Still, last month’s deliveries in the region were 22
percent below the 29,824 vehicles registered in March 2008.  “For markets like the U.S. and Europe, we’re probably not
at the peak yet,” said  Arndt Ellinghorst , a London-based
analyst with Credit Suisse.  Volvo said last month it was recalling 700 workers at its
plant in New River Valley,  Virginia , to boost production.
 Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s largest truckmaker, is expanding
factories in  Mexico  to make more Freightliner models. Daimler
will report results April 29.  Volvo’s 4.09 billion kronor net income beat the 3.48
billion-kronor average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 12
analysts. Revenue rose 22 percent to 71.6 billion kronor. Truck
orders advanced 40 percent in the quarter to 61,292 vehicles.  ‘Strong’ Results  “Volvo delivered a strong set of numbers,” said Morten Imsgard, an analyst at Sydbank A/S in Aabenraa, Denmark, with an
“overweight” rating on the shares. “Volvo has a strong
discipline keeping the costs down while sales go up.”  Volvo cut 21 billion kronor in spending during the downturn
that started in 2008 by slashing jobs and other costs. At least
half those reductions should be permanent, the Swedish company
has said. The truck division’s first-quarter sales rose 25
percent led by the gains in  North America  and Europe. The unit’s
operating profit almost tripled to 4.29 billion kronor.  Soedertaelje, Sweden-based Scania, which has the best
operating margin in the commercial-vehicles industry, reported
net income that beat the average estimate of 2.23 billion kronor
in a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts. Sales gained 25 percent to
20.7 billion kronor.  “Order bookings in Europe were relatively strong at the
end of 2010, when many hauliers carried out replacement
investments,” Chief Executive Officer Leif Oestling said in the
statement. “The first-quarter was characterized by somewhat
lower activity.”  Scania’s orders in the first three months of 2011 rose 20
percent to 19,457 trucks and buses, while deliveries surged 60
percent to 19,065. The VW unit said orders in  Latin America  rose
3 percent as deals in  Brazil  were delayed by a new government
financing program.  “Scania is clearly at peak levels because of its large
exposure to Latin America,” Ellinghorst said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
