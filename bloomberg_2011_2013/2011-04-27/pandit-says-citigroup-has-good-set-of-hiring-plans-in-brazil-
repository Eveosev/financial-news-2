Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, has a “good set of hiring plans in Brazil,” Chief
Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  said.  The bank added more than 340 employees in Brazil last
month, according to Gustavo Marin, the New York-based company’s
head of Brazil. Marin and Pandit spoke to reporters today in Sao
Paulo.  Brazil’s economy grew at the fastest pace in more than two
decades last year after emerging from the global financial
crisis. The currency has gained 47 percent against the dollar
since December 2008, as foreign investors, including U.S. banks,
poured 20.6 billion reais into the stock market in 2009.  The pace of credit growth in Brazil, running at an annual
clip of more than 20 percent, has spurred inflation and led
officials to raise  interest rates  and tax consumer credit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
