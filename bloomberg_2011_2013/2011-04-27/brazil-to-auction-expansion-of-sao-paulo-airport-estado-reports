Brazil  will put up for auction to
private companies the expansion of airports in  Sao Paulo ,
Brasilia, Campinas,  Belo Horizonte  and Rio de Janeiro,  Estado de
S. Paulo  reported, citing chief of staff Antonio Palocci.  The government will publish terms of the auction for
Guarulhos airport in Sao Paulo, the Juscelino Kubitschek airport
in Brasilia and the Campinas airport in May, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said. The terms for the expansion of Galeao airport in
Rio de Janeiro and Confins airport in Belo Horizonte will be
announced by early July, Estado said.  The expansion of the five airports will require $3.99
billion ($2.56 billion) of investments, Estado said, citing
estimates by Infraero, the government-owned airport operator.  The companies that win the bids will have the right to
commercial development in the new terminals in exchange for
building them, the paper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
