The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission voted 4-1 today to reopen or extend public comment
periods for proposed derivatives regulations under the Dodd-
Frank Act for an additional 30 days.  “This time will allow the public to submit comments they
might have after seeing the entire mosaic at once,” CFTC
Chairman  Gary Gensler  said today at an agency meeting in
 Washington . The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission
are holding a public forum next week to discuss implementation
of derivatives rules required by the financial-rules overhaul
enacted in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
