Bank Millennium SA (MIL) , the Polish unit
of  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) , said first-quarter profit
climbed 49 percent after it cut bad-loan provisions.  Net income rose to 101.2 million zloty ($37.7 million) from
68.1 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said in
a statement today, missing the 112.7 million-zloty average
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The shares fell
1.6 percent to 5.65 zloty by 11:03 a.m. in Warsaw trading.  Millennium, the first Polish bank to report first-quarter
earnings, said bad-loan provisions fell 56 percent to 37.1
million zloty. Net interest income climbed 17 percent as lending
rose 10 percent to 36.3 billion zloty. New home loans increased
41 percent.  In  Poland , the largest central European country and the
only economy to avoid recession in 2009, banking profits surged
41 percent in 2010 from a year earlier. The financial industry
may continue to benefit from expanding economy, which is
expected to grow by about 4 percent this year and next,
according to government estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
