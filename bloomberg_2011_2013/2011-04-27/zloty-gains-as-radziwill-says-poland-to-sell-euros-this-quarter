The Polish zloty advanced for a
third day after Deputy Finance Minister  Dominik Radziwill  said
the government will this quarter “definitely” convert some
euros it received from the European Union on the market.  The zloty strengthened 0.1 percent to 3.9348 per euro as of
4:39 p.m. in Warsaw for the second-steepest appreciation among
more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Poland will exchange as much as 14 billion euros ($20.4
billion) it expects to receive from the European Union this
year, Radziwill said in a statement on April 21. The sales “may
ease pressure to increase  interest rates ,” reduce volatility
and absorb liquidity on the  interbank market , Finance Minister
Jacek Rostowski said at a news conference with central bank
Governor Marek Belka.  “They will finally pull the trigger,” Marcin Turkiewicz,
currency trader at BRE Bank SA, a unit of Commerzbank AG, said
by telephone from Warsaw. The currency could appreciate to as
strong as 3.9 per euro, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
