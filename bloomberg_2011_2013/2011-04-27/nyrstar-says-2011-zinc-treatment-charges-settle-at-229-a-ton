Nyrstar (NYR)  NV, the largest producer of
refined zinc by capacity, said raw-material processing fees for
2011 were settled at $229 a metric ton.  Treatment charges, the fees mining companies pay smelters
to have their semi-processed ore turned into finished metal, are
based on a zinc price of $2,500 a ton, Balen, Belgium-based
Nyrstar said today in a statement. The company a year ago agreed
on charges of about $250 a ton, based on a zinc price of $2,000.  Nyrstar, which owns metal refineries and smelters on four
continents, has acquired mines and mining-company stakes in the
U.S.,  Peru ,  Greenland ,  Chile  and  Mexico  over the past two years,
as well as zinc-ore output from Talvivaara Mining Co. in
 Finland . Nyrstar aims to raise refined-zinc production from its
own raw material to 50 percent from 30 percent.  Output of zinc in concentrate gained 64 percent in the
first quarter from the previous three months, the company said
today.  Smelters will be paid an extra 6 cents for every dollar the
market moves above the set price, Nyrstar said in the statement.
For every drop of a dollar, smelters will receive 4 cents less.  “We had previously forecast $242 a ton at a basis price of
$2,000 a ton,” London-based Liberum Capital Ltd. said in a note
to investors. “This will likely have a negative impact on our
2011 estimates.”  Shares Fall  Nyrstar fell 22 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 9.37 euros by the
5:30 p.m. close in Brussels. The shares are little changed this
year, giving the company a market value of 1.59 billion euros
($2.3 billion).  Zinc is used in galvanized steel, required by the
construction and auto industries. Zinc for three-month delivery
on the  London  Metal Exchange recently traded at $2,235 a ton,
for a drop of 8.9 percent in 2011, the worst performance among
the six main metals traded on the LME.  Nyrstar also produces lead, used in vehicle batteries and
plumbing. Most lead treatment fees were settled at $220 to $290
a ton, according to the statement. Nyrstar said it expects lead
charges to average $240 a ton.  Lead for three-month delivery traded recently at $2,503 a
ton on the LME. Prices are down 1.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
