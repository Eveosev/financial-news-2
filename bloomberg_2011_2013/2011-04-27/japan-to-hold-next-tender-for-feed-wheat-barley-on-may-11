Japan  will hold a tender for a
maximum of 50,000 metric tons of feed wheat and 200,000 tons of
feed barley on May 11, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries said today.  The ministry, which holds feed-grain import tenders every
Wednesday, didn’t purchase anything today because of a lack of
demand from end-users, Masafumi Otsuka at the ministry’s grain-
trade division said today. There won’t be a regular tender on
May 4 because of a national holiday.  Tenders are held under the so-called simultaneous buy-and-
sell system, in which feed makers and trading companies jointly
bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
