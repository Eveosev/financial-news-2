The Vietnamese dong rose to the
strongest level in more than two months as the government said
supply of the U.S. currency has been “abundant” since the
central bank capped dollar deposit rates.  Government bonds  fell.  The  State Bank  of  Vietnam ’s ceilings on dollar deposit
rates took effect April 13, restricting rates for individuals to
3 percent and those for non-credit institutions to 1 percent.
Holdings of dong can earn interest of as much as 14 percent.
Some small banks have been taking in some $10 million to $15
million daily from customers in exchange for dong, the
government said in a  statement  on its website today.  The dong gained 0.3 percent to 20,650 per dollar as of 4
p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 20,645, the strongest level since Feb. 10.  The dong-dollar  exchange rate  offered by banks has been
lower than the maximum allowed by the central bank, which is “a
phenomenon that rarely happens,” the government said today.  The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,698 today,
compared with 20,703 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  Government bonds slid, with the yield on the benchmark
five-year bonds advancing 10 basis points to 12.53 percent,
according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
