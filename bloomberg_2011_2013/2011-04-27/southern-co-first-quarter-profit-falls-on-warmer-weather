Southern Co. (SO) , the biggest U.S.
utility owner by market value, said first-quarter profit
declined as warmer weather than a year earlier curbed
electricity demand for heating.  Profit fell to $422.3 million, or 50 cents a share, from
$494.5 million, or 60 cents, a year ago, Atlanta-based Southern
said in a statement today. The company was expected to earn 51
cents a share, the average of 16 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales fell 3.5 percent to $4.01 billion from $4.16
billion.  Average daily demand in the first quarter for heating in
 Georgia , where Southern has the most customers, fell 20 percent
from a year earlier, according to National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration data compiled by Bloomberg. The 2010
first quarter was the state’s coldest in 32 years, according to
NOAA.  Southern sells electricity to customers in Alabama,
 Florida , Georgia and Mississippi. It owns  power plants  capable
of generating 42,000 megawatts, enough for 33.6 million average
U.S. homes, according to Energy Department statistics. It is
building two nuclear units in Georgia and expects final federal
approval for them by year-end.  Total retail sales fell 3.9 percent from the first quarter
of 2010 as residential and commercial customers bought less
electricity. Sale of power to manufacturers was the only segment
that increased in the first three months, rising 6.7 percent
from a year earlier, the company said.  The results were announced before regular trading began on
U.S. markets. Southern rose 9 cents to $38.62 yesterday in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading. It has risen 1 percent
this year. The shares have five buy ratings, 16 holds and a sell
from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
