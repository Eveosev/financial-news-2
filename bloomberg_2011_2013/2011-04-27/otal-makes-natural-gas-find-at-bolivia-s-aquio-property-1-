Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-biggest
oil producer, said it found natural gas in the jungle in eastern
 Bolivia .  Total can’t confirm the size of reserves at its Aquio
property, located in the Incahuasi gas field, Total spokeswoman
Phenelope Semavoine said today by telephone from Paris.  Bolivia’s news agency  ABI  reported earlier today that the
discovery will boost the Andean country’s gas reserves by 30
percent to 13 trillion cubic feet, citing Carlos Villegas, chief
executive officer of state oil company Yacimientos Petroliferos
Fiscales Bolivianos, known as YPFB.  “These reserves will enable Bolivia to meet both its
natural-gas export commitments to  Brazil  and Argentina and
domestic demand in the coming years,” Villegas told ABI.  The Incahuasi field, where Total and partner Tecpetrol SA
have invested $70 million in the past 16 months drilling down to
6,300 meters (20,800 feet), may produce 18 million cubic meters
of gas per day, ABI said. Bolivia currently exports 30 million
cubic meters of gas per day of gas to Brazil and 7.7 million
cubic meters to Argentina, according to YPFB’s website.  Total may invest $800 million in the development of the
field, the company’s Bolivia country manager Jean Daniel Blasco
said, according to an e-mailed statement from YPFB.  The Bolivian energy ministry’s press office said they
didn’t have any details about the find.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
and BP Plc are Europe’s biggest oil companies.  Total rose 1.3 percent to 42.595 euros in Paris. The stock
has gained 7.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
