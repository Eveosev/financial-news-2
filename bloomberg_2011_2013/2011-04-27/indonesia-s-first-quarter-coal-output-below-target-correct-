Indonesia ’s first-quarter coal
production was below target after rains disrupted mining, said
Bob Kamandanu, chairman of the Indonesian Coal Mining
Association.  Output rose to 32.43 million metric tons in March from
27.15 million in February and 29.54 million in January,
Kamandanu said in an interview at the Coal Upgrading &
Conversion conference in Singapore today. The average for the
quarter at 29.7 million tons a month compares with 30 million
tons a month a year earlier. The monthly target this year was
about 30 million tons.  “Production was unchanged because of a very wet season,”
Kamandanu said. “We hope to see a real dry season this year as
most of last year was wet.”  Indonesia’s coal production may rise to between 335 million
and 370 million tons this year, Kamandanu said at the
conference. Output climbed to 325 million tons in 2010 from 283
million in 2009, he said.  Exports of the fuel fell 5.9 percent to 68.8 million tons
in the first quarter from 73.1 million a year earlier because of
a delay in issuing trading permits by the government earlier
this year, according to calculations based on Kamandanu’s data.  Overseas sales rose to 25.8 million in March from 20.3
million in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
