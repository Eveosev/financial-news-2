Asia gasoline’s premium to naphtha,
or the reforming margin, gained the most in almost four weeks.
Reliance Industries Ltd. sold gasoil cargoes in  Singapore , the
region’s biggest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  fell for
the first time in a week, losing 0.3 percent to $1,078 a ton,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline advanced 0.8 percent to $131.85 a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha
climbed 11 percent to $14.10 a barrel, the most since April 1. A
wider reforming margin signals that the profit from making
gasoline over naphtha is increasing.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the
crack spread, narrowed to $140.39 a ton from $147.43 at the end
of Asian trading yesterday.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur rebounded 50
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $137.55 a barrel, according to
Bloomberg data.  Jet fuel  increased $1, or 0.7 percent, to
$139.10.  In Singapore, Reliance Industries sold two 150,000-barrel
cargoes of gasoil with 10 parts-per-million of sulfur at $2.70 a
barrel over quotes, traders said. The buyers were BP Plc and
Royal Dutch Shell Plc. Total SA sold 250,000 barrels of 0.5
percent sulfur grade to Vitol Group at a 10-cent premium.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude rose 27
cents to $19.51 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure
of refining profit, rebounded from the narrowest since March 2.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil advanced for the third day,
adding 20 cents to $1.25 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade was at
the widest since March 25, indicating it’s profitable to produce
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  BP bought jet fuel in Singapore, bringing its tally for
this week to six cargoes, traders said. The company paid Hin
Leong Trading Pte 20 cents a barrel above benchmark quotes for
100,000 barrels, the same premium as in the earlier purchases.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil dropped $5.75, or 0.8
percent, to $680.75 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. That’s
the lowest in a week. The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil,
mainly used as marine fuel, fell $4.25, or 0.6 percent, to
$669.75.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened $1.06 to $12.32
a barrel, indicating the biggest losses from turning oil into
residual products in 29 months, Bloomberg data showed. The
premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke grade, or
the viscosity spread, dropped $1.50 to $11 a ton. That’s the
narrowest in three weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
