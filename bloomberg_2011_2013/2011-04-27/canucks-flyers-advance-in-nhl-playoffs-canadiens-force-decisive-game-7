The top-seeded  Vancouver Canucks 
and the  Philadelphia Flyers  advanced to the conference
semifinals in the National Hockey League playoffs, while the
 Montreal Canadiens  forced a decisive seventh game against the
Boston Bruins.  Alex Burrows scored 5 minutes, 22 seconds into overtime,
his second goal of the game, to lift the host Canucks to a 2-1
victory against the defending champion Chicago Blackhawks at
Rogers Arena in Game 7 of their series. Chicago’s Jonathan Toews
scored with 1:56 remaining in the third period to force
overtime. The Blackhawks had rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the
series to force a seventh game.  The Flyers advanced to the second round last night with a
5-2 win against the  Buffalo Sabres  in Game 7 at Wells Fargo
Center in Philadelphia. Braydon Coburn, Danny Briere, James van Riemsdyk, Ville Leino and Daniel Carcillo scored for the Flyers,
who last won the Stanley Cup in 1974-75.  Tyler Myers and Brad Boyes scored for the Sabres.  At Bell Centre in Montreal, the Canadiens stopped a streak
of three straight losses by beating the Bruins 2-1. Montreal
travels to Boston tonight for the final game in the best-of-
seven series and a spot in the second round.  Mike Cammalleri scored in the first period for Montreal,
and Brian Gionta scored the winning goal in the second. Dennis Seidenberg had Boston’s only goal.  In tonight’s other game,  Tampa Bay  travels to Pittsburgh
for Game 7 in their first-round series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
