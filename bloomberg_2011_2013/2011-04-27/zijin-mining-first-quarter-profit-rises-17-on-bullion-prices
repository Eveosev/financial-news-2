Zijin Mining Group Co.,  China ’s
biggest gold miner by market value, said first-quarter profit
rose 17 percent as bullion and copper prices surged.  Net income was 1.39 billion yuan ($213 million), or 0.096
yuan a share, the company said in a statement to the Shanghai
stock exchange yesterday, citing domestic accounting standards.  Zijin is spending as much as 9 billion yuan this year on
acquisitions and expansion as metal prices reach record levels.
Bullion climbed to a high of $1,519.20 an ounce on April 25 in
 New York  and copper traded at a record $10,190 a metric ton on
Feb. 15 in  London . Turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East,
and a decline in the  U.S. dollar  boosted bullion’s investment
attraction.  Gold averaged $1,388.17 an ounce on the Comex in New York
in the quarter compared with $1,109.96 an ounce a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg data. Futures for June delivery rose as
much as 1.3 percent to a record $1,522.80 an ounce on the Comex
on April 27.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange averaged $9,628.18 a ton, up 32 percent from a year
ago.  --Xiao Yu. Editors: Alan Soughley, Josh Fellman  To contact the reporter on this story:
