SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG) ,  New York
City ’s biggest office landlord, said first-quarter funds from
operations rose 68 percent as rent revenue jumped. The company
also increased its full-year FFO projection.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, rose to $142.8 million, or $1.75 a share, from $85
million, or $1.07, a year earlier, the New York-based real
estate investment trust said yesterday in a statement. It was
expected to have FFO of $1.02 a share, the average estimate of
16 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  SL Green has been among New York’s busiest buyers, sellers
and financiers of office properties. In the last 12 months, it
purchased 125 Park Ave. and 600 Lexington Ave., sold an interest
in the McGraw-Hill Building, refinanced 3 Columbus Circle, and
formed a joint venture with rival  Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)  to hold
debt on 280 Park Ave. Chief Executive Officer Marc Holliday said
in January he expects Manhattan office rents to rebound by at
least 25 percent from the 2009 low.  “The message is going to be the uptrend in rents has
begun,” said Jay Leupp, president of Grubb & Ellis AGA Mutual
Funds, a  San Mateo , California-based  fund manager  that held
about 800 shares of SL Green as of March 31. “That’s likely,
unless you’re expecting material new supply in Midtown, to
continue for the next three to four years.”  Leupp was interviewed before yesterday’s statement.  The company increased its FFO projection for 2011 to
between $4.65 and $4.80 a share, up from a December estimate of
$4.05 to $4.20.  Rent Revenue  Rent revenue for the quarter was $229 million, a 19 percent
increase from a year earlier. Total revenue was $334.3 million,
up 33 percent. The company reported $38.7 million of additional
income from the sale of debt on 280 Park Ave. to the joint
venture with Vornado.  Manhattan office leasing volume reached a four-and-a-half-
year high in the first quarter, and rents rose for the second
consecutive quarter after two years of declines, Cushman &
Wakefield Inc. reported on April 5. Offices above the 25th floor
in top-quality Midtown buildings were more than 99 percent
leased, CB Richard Ellis Group Inc. said on April 14.  First-quarter results were announced after the close of
regular U.S. trading yesterday. SL Green rose 71 cents to $80.97
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. The
stock has gained 20 percent this year, compared with a 12
percent increase in the Bloomberg REIT Office Property Index.  SL Green owned interests in 43 Manhattan properties
totaling 29.7 million square feet (2.8 million square meters),
including 22.3 million feet of office buildings, as of March 31,
according to the statement. Its properties include the 1.4
million-square-foot Graybar Building and 10 others within a two-
block radius of Grand Central Terminal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
