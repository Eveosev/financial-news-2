The New Zealand dollar declined
after Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard left the
benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low and said the
economic outlook “remains very uncertain.”  The currency slid to 80.45 U.S. cents as of 9:03 a.m. in
Wellington from 80.80 cents just before the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
