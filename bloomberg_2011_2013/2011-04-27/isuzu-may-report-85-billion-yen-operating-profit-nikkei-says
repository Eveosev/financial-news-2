Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202) ,  Japan ’s largest
maker of light trucks, may post operating profit of 85 billion
yen ($1 billion) for the year ended March 31, the Nikkei said.  Net income may be lower than the company’s forecast of 52
billion yen, the report said, without saying where it got the

trading, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
