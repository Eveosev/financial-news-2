Crude oil rose to a two-week high
after a U.S. Energy Department report showed that gasoline
stockpiles tumbled to the lowest level since August 2009.  Futures climbed 0.5 percent after the department said
gasoline inventories fell 2.51 million barrels to 205.6 million
last week. Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, declined 1.81 million barrels to 146.5
million. Prices briefly dropped on a 6.16 million-barrel gain in
crude oil stockpiles and surging imports.  “Gasoline supplies are definitely on the light side,”
said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF Advisors in
Houston. “With gasoline supplies falling and prices climbing,
refiners can pay more for oil. They are going to pay more to
take delivery of extra barrels of crude because they know they
will make money processing it into gasoline.”  Crude oil for June delivery rose 55 cents to $112.76 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the highest
settlement since April 8 when futures climbed to $112.79, a 31-
month high. Prices are up 37 percent from a year ago.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 6.22 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to end the session at $3.4194 a gallon in  New York . It was the
highest settlement price since July 14, 2008.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 1 cent to $3.879 a gallon yesterday, the most since
Aug. 3, 2008, AAA said on its  website .  Gasoline demand rose 0.8 percent to 9.06 million barrels a
day over the past four weeks, 1.6 percent lower than a year
earlier, according to the report.  “Gasoline supplies keep dropping despite low demand,
because there’s probably a lot of U.S. product being sent
overseas,” Cooper said.  Fuel Shipments  U.S. fuel exports  averaged a record 2.29 million barrels a
day from March 11 through April 8, department data shows.  Crude oil supplies rose 1.7 percent 363.1 million barrels
in the week ended April 22, the highest level since November,
the report showed. It was the biggest one-week advance since
July. Stockpiles were forecast to increase 1.7 million barrels,
according to the median of 13 analyst projections in a Bloomberg
News survey.  “This was a mixed report,” said  Gene McGillian , a broker
and analyst with Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“Under normal circumstances a crude build of over 6 million
barrels and a big increase in imports would be enough to send us
much lower. Prices did drop but soon rebounded because we still
have falling gasoline and distillate stocks.”  Refineries operated at 82.7 percent of capacity, up 0.2
percentage point from the prior week. That’s down from 89
percent of capacity a year earlier. A 0.9 percentage-point
increase was forecast in the Bloomberg News survey.  Crack Spread  The crack spread, or profit from processing three barrels
of oil into two of gasoline and one of heating oil, climbed 4.7
percent to $26.77 at 3:40 p.m., based on New York futures
prices. The differential widened to $28.518 on April 18, the
highest level since May 18, 2007.  Oil also climbed after the  Federal Reserve  renewed its
pledge to stimulate growth with low  interest rates  and said a
pickup in inflation is likely to be temporary. The Fed
announcement bolstered equities and sent the dollar lower.  “The economic recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace
and overall conditions in the labor market are improving
gradually,” the  Federal Open Market Committee  said today in its
statement after a two-day meeting in  Washington . “Increases in
the prices of energy and other commodities have pushed up
inflation in recent months,” and the Fed expects “these
effects to be transitory,” according to the statement.  Equity Rally  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 67.62 points to
12,662.99, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4
percent to 1,352.01 at 3:14 p.m.  The dollar fell 0.7 percent to $1.4749 against the euro,
after slipping to $1.4752, the weakest level since December
2009. A drop in the dollar makes commodities priced in the
currency more attractive for investors.  Gold for June delivery increased $13.60, or 0.9 percent, to
settle at $1,517.10 an ounce on the Comex in New York. The
precious metal reached $1,527.70, an intraday record.  Oil has advanced 23 percent in New York this year. Unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa has toppled leaders in Egypt
and  Tunisia  and spread to  Libya ,  Algeria ,  Bahrain ,  Iran , Oman,
Syria and Yemen.  Brent oil for June settlement increased 99 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $125.13 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest close
since April 8.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 529,841
contracts as of 3:11 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 448,963
contracts yesterday, 41 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.55 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
