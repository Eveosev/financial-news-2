Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the diversified
mining company with about $70 billion of expansion plans, aims
to more than quadruple nickel output this decade to better
compete with larger rivals OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel and Vale SA.  The London-based company may produce as much as 180,000
metric tons by 2020 as it ramps up output at its Barro Alto
project in Brazil and weighs investing another $6 billion in two
new ventures in the country, Walter De Simoni, chief executive
officer of Anglo’s nickel unit, said yesterday in an interview.  Competitors such as Vale and  Xstrata Plc. (XTA)  are boosting
output after prices for nickel, used in stainless steel to
prevent corrosion, surpassed $29,000 per metric ton in February,
the highest since April 2008. Global output is expected to climb
about 10 percent, or 163,000 metric tons, to 1.83 million tons
this year, according to  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , as the economic
recovery boosts metals demand in construction and industry.  “The nickel business is going very well,” De Simoni, a
Brazilian national, said on the sidelines of the World Economic
Forum conference in Rio de Janeiro yesterday. “After the 2008
crisis, the nickel business recovered faster than everybody
would have thought and the price now is much stronger.”  Anglo started production at the $1.9 billion Barro Alto
nickel project in Brazil’s Goias state last month and is aiming
for average output of 41,000 metric tons annually in the first
five years after attaining full capacity in 2012. The company
may add a further 112,000 tons per year from two projects in
 Brazil  - Jacare and Morro Sem Bone - which are yet to be
approved and may require about $6 billion, he said.  Nickel Output  Still, Anglo’s current output of 38,700 tons is dwarfed by
that of larger rivals. Norilsk, the world’s biggest producer,
said Jan. 31 that output may rise to as much as 315,000 metric
tons this year, 5.9 percent higher than in 2010. Vale, which
aims to overtake Moscow-based Norilsk, plans to reach 295,000
metric tons this year after producing 179,000 tons in 2010.  “Nowadays nickel is a small business in Anglo and we have
the big responsibility and challenge to make it grow,” said De
Simoni, 55, who’s based in  Sao Paulo . “When Barro Alto is at
full capacity, we will be achieving more than $1 billion in
revenues, from $300 million now.”  Export Market  More than 80 percent of the nickel from Barro Alto is
destined for export, mainly to European customers such as
ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, ThyssenKrupp AG
and Acerinox SA, he said. The company has also begun exporting
the metal to  China , De Simoni said.  Anglo has been operating in Brazil since 1973 and has two
units for its nickel and iron-ore businesses, according to the
company’s website. The first iron-ore from its $5 billion Minas
Rio project will be shipped in the second half of 2013.  De Simoni started his career in Anglo in 1978 and was named
head of the nickel unit in 2009. He was appointed president of
Anglo’s base metals unit in Brazil in 2005 and became CEO of the
company in that country a year later.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell $20, or 0.1 percent, to close at $26,630 a metric
ton yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
