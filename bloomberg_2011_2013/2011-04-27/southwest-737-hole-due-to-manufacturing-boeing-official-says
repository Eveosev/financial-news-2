The nearly 5-foot-long hole that
opened in a  Boeing Co. (BA)  737-300 as  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  flew it
over Arizona at 34,000 feet on April 1 was likely due to
manufacturing, Boeing airplanes chief James Albaugh said.  The  National Transportation Safety Board ’s analysis “looks
consistent with our view, and it does look like there was a
manufacturing issue on that airplane,” Albaugh told reporters
after delivering a speech at a conference in  Washington .  The NTSB said April 25 that the plane, delivered to
Southwest in 1996, had misaligned rivet holes where two parts of
the fuselage were assembled. Cracks stretched from 42 of the 58
rivet holes along the 9-inch-wide hole, the NTSB found.  Until the NTSB makes a final report, Chicago-based Boeing
doesn’t want to discuss what it needs to change or do different,
Albaugh said.  “We’re always looking at manufacturing processes and we
have a responsibility to build those planes perfectly, we
understand that,” he said.  There were 123 people on the plane, which made an emergency
landing in Yuma,  Arizona . One passenger and one flight attendant
for Dallas-based Southwest were injured. The aircraft had 39,781
takeoffs and landings prior to the incident. Boeing said April 5
that cracks on the so-called 737 Classic weren’t forecast to
occur until after 60,000 takeoffs and landings.  Boeing Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said on an
earnings call today that the investigation so far shows the
cracking is “not a design issue across the fleet of airplanes.’  To contact the reporters on this story:
