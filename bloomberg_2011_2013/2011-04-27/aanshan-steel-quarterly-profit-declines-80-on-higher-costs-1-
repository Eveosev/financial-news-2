Maanshan Iron & Steel (323)  Co., the
second-biggest Hong Kong-traded steelmaker, said first-quarter
profit fell 80 percent because of higher fuel and raw material
costs.  Net income for the quarter ended March 31 fell to 106.1
million yuan ($16.3 million), or 0.014 yuan a share, from 520.6
million yuan, or 0.068 yuan a share, a year ago, the Maanshan,
Anhui province-based company said today in a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange. Operating revenue climbed 43 percent
to 20.5 billion yuan on rising steel product prices.  Competition and high raw material costs depressed profit
margins for  China ’s key steelmakers to only 3 percent in the
first quarter, the government said April 14. Spot prices for 62-
percent iron ore arriving in Tianjin gained 5.2 percent this
year to $178.90 as of April 26, according to the Steel Index.
Operating costs for the company rose more than 50 percent in the
first three months of the year versus 2010, the steelmaker said
in today’s statement.  Maanshan fell 2.6 percent to close at HK$4.16 in  Hong Kong 
today. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  was down 0.5 percent.  “At present, prices of raw materials and fuels still
remained at high levels, resulting in a continuous rise in
production costs for iron and steel enterprises,” it said in
the statement.  The average price of steel reinforcing bars in China gained
22 percent to 4,746 yuan a ton in the first quarter from a year
ago, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.
Prices of cold-rolled sheets, used in cars and appliances,
dropped 2.3 percent in the same period.  Vehicle sales in China may grow 10 percent this year after
rising 32 percent last year, stoking concern that demand for
automotive steel sheets may slow,  Xu Lejiang , chairman of
Baosteel Group Corp., China’s second-largest mill, said last
month.  Steel bars and wire accounted for 32 percent of Maanshan’s
sales last year, while sheets and plates accounted for 50
percent, according to the company.  --Helen Yuan, Liza Lin, with assistance from Marco Lui.
