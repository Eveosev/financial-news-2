Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the largest
maker of computer-networking equipment, is offering early-
retirement packages to some employees in the U.S. and Canada in
an effort to control costs.  The move reflects “our ongoing commitment to responsible
business management,”  San Jose , California-based Cisco said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Chief Executive Officer  John Chambers  has promised to make
“targeted moves” to sharpen the company’s focus after
branching out into more than 30 side businesses. One of the
first steps came earlier this month, when Cisco announced plans
to close its Flip video-camera business and cut 550 jobs.  Investors expect Cisco to sell more of its consumer
businesses, consolidate operations and shake up its management
structure as part of the changes, Tal Liani, an analyst at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch, said in a note today.  The company didn’t specify how many workers it expected to
take the packages or how much would be saved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
