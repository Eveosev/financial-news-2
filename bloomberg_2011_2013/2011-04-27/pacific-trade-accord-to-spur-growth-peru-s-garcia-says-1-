A trade accord between  Mexico ,
Chile, Colombia and Peru to be signed tomorrow will spur
regional economic growth and enable the Latin American nations
to compete with Asia, Peru’s President  Alan Garcia  said.  The agreement, known as the Pacific Accord, will boost
trade by cutting import tariffs, Garcia said today after meeting
with Mexican President Felipe Calderon at the presidential
palace in Lima. Mexico, Latin America’s second-biggest economy,
signed a separate free-trade accord with Peru on April 6.  “This represents a new integration model that will enable
us to compete with the powerful economies of Asia and the rest
of the world,” Garcia said. “Mexico is a solid ally for Peru,
Chile and Colombia due to its size, the strength of its
companies and its agriculture.”  Peru aims to triple annual exports to $90 billion over the
next 10 years after signing trade accords with the U.S.,  Canada ,
South Korea and China. Trade between Pacific Rim nations Mexico,
Chile, Colombia and Peru totaled $6 billion last year, according
to Peru’s tax authority Sunat.  Chile’s Sebastian Pinera and Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia
are scheduled to arrive in Lima tomorrow to sign the accord.  Mexico’s peso was little changed at 11.5270 per  U.S. dollar 
at 7:52 p.m. New York time. The Peruvian sol weakened 0.1
percent to close at 2.8305 per U.S. dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
