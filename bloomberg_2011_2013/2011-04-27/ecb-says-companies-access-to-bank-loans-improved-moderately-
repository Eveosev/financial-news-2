The  European Central Bank  said
companies’ access to bank loans has improved “moderately”
since September.  Citing its survey of small and medium-sized enterprises, or
SMEs, the Frankfurt-based ECB said availability of external
financing “continued to improve, albeit moderately” in the six
months from September through February. Access to bank loans
rose 3 percentage points to a net minus 9 percent, it said. At
the same time, SMEs’ financing needs “increased slightly” from
September. “The survey results point to somewhat higher rates
of success when applying for a loan,” the ECB said.  Loan demand in the euro region is picking up as companies
in fast-growing economies such as  Germany  look to invest to
boost capacity and meet increasing export demand.  Europe ’s
largest economy, which drove euro-region growth in 2010, will
expand 2.6 percent this year, the government predicts.  The percentage of respondents reporting access to finance
as their main problem was “broadly unchanged” at 16 percent,
the ECB said. The survey was conducted between Feb. 21 and March
25, covering 7,532 firms in the euro area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
