Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  jumped the most in seven weeks in Prague trading after the
broadcaster partly owned by Time Warner Inc. said its first-
quarter loss shrank as advertising spending started to recover.  CME, as the company is known, rose as much as 3.4 percent,
its biggest intraday advance since March 8, and traded up 2
percent at 353 koruna as of 9:20 a.m. in Prague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
