State-controlled Alliance Bank,
Kazakhstan’s sixth-largest lender by assets, said a 105 billion
tenge ($722 million) capital shortfall noted by auditors
resulted from discrepancies in accounting standards.  Under international standards, the Almaty-based bank had a
capital shortage as of Dec. 31, while by Kazakh rules it had
33.8 billion tenge at its disposal, Alliance said in a statement
to investors today.  “In its operations the bank is governed by  capital
requirements  established by the local regulator,” spokesman
Dmitry Shishkin said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“Thus the capital deficit identified by the auditor according
to international standards has no impact on the bank’s day-to-
day operations.”  KPMG  Audit LLC found “material uncertainties that may cast
significant doubt” on the ability of Alliance and its
subsidiaries “to continue as a going concern.” KPMG  cited  the
capital shortfall and a negativity liquidity gap of 139 billion
tenge as causes for concern.  Alliance, the first Kazakh lender to default in 2009, has
completed restructuring $4.5 billion of debt, reducing the
amount it owes to about $1 billion, the bank said in March 2010.
The state-owned National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna holds 67
percent of Alliance’s ordinary shares after the reorganization.  The bank seeks to sell 119 billion tenge of corporate and
small business loans, it said in the statement to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
