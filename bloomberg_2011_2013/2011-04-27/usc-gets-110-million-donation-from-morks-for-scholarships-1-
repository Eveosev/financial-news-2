The  University of Southern
California  received $110 million from Julie and John Mork to
fund undergraduate scholarships, the fourth donation of more
than $50 million given to USC this school year.  The scholarships will pay for four years of college tuition
and a $5,000 annual stipend for high school seniors “of
extraordinary intellectual talent and capability,” the private
university in  Los Angeles  said today in a  statement .  With the Mork donation, USC has received more than $400
million since Oct. 15, when C.L. Max Nikias became president. On
March 9, the university got a pledge of $200 million from Dana
and David Dornsife to support undergraduate education. USC also
received $50 million from Ming Hsieh, a trustee, for  cancer
research , and $50 million from the Annenberg Foundation, based
in Los Angeles, to train journalists.  John Mork, a trustee who graduated from USC in 1970, is the
chief executive officer of Energy Corp. of America, a privately
held oil and gas company based in Denver. The Mork family also
donated $15 million to USC’s engineering school in 2006.  “Attending USC is the dream of talented high school seniors
from all walks of life,” John Mork said in the statement. “We
hope this gift will help transform hundreds of young lives.”  USC, founded in 1880, has about 35,000 students and is the
largest private, not-for-profit U.S. university on the West
Coast. Its alumni include astronaut  Neil Armstrong  and actor
 John Wayne .  To contact the reporter on this story:
