Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  said
Citigroup Inc.’s account of the bank’s role facilitating the
company’s deal to buy Lubrizol Corp. was inconsistent with what
David Sokol had told Chairman  Warren Buffett .  Comments from the bank “did not square with Mr. Sokol’s
remark in January that he had come to know Lubrizol by owning
the stock,” Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said today in a
statement. Sokol resigned after details about his stake were
disclosed to Berkshire, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
