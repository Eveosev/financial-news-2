TH Plantations Bhd. (THP) , a Malaysian
 palm oil  producer, said it expects higher output of fresh fruit
bunches this year as more trees come to maturity.  The Kuala Lumpur-based company is targeting 504,901 metric
tons of palm bunches this year from 463,949 tons in 2010 after
applying fertilizers, Chief Executive Officer Zainal Azwar Zainal Aminuddin told reporters in  Kuala Lumpur  today. TH
Plantations is “upbeat” over potentially higher yields, he
said.  Malaysian palm oil producers reported improved earnings
last year as rainfall caused by the La Nina weather event
spurred a rally in crude palm oil prices. TH Plantations’ profit
rose 66 percent to 89.5 million ringgit ($30 million) as revenue
climbed to 366 million ringgit after fetching more for its
edible oil and kernels.  “Prices of palm oil have been still buoyant, above our
budgeted prices,” said Zainal. “If it continues to remain this
stable, this strong, then obviously we may exceed last year’s”
revenue, he said.  Palm oil prices on the Malaysian Derivatives Exchange have
averaged at 3,561 ringgit a ton this year. The company had
targeted 2,800 ringgit a metric ton as its base price for crude
palm oil this year, Zainal said. That’s up from an average price
of 2,715 ringgit in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Its shares closed unchanged at 2.20 ringgit today, after
surging 45 percent over the past this year.  The company aims to expand its  land bank  to 50,000 hectares
from the existing 39,113 hectares by 2012 and is looking at
 Malaysia ’s eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak, and is also
currently conducting feasibility studies to expand in
 Indonesia ’s Sumatra and Kalimantan provinces, Zainal said.  It has allocated 150 million ringgit as capital expenditure
for this year to develop plantations, replant palms and to
partly fund the construction of a 60-ton capacity mill and
housing complex in Sarawak, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
