Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) , the fourth-
biggest U.S. railroad, posted a quarterly profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as the economic recovery boosts shipping
volumes.  Profit excluding some items was $1 a share, topping the 90-
cent average estimate from 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Net income climbed 26 percent to $325 million, or 90 cents a
share, from $257 million, or 68 cents, a year earlier, the
Norfolk, Virginia-based company said today in a statement.  Total rail volumes excluding grain and coal shipments rose
7.9 percent to 4.6 million carloads in the quarter ended March
31, according to the  Association of American Railroads  in
 Washington . Demand for goods shipped by rail is climbing as the
economy rebounds, boosting revenue at Norfolk Southern. Sales
rose 17 percent to $2.62 billion from a year earlier.  “Our volumes are up and we can expect them to continue to
be up throughout the year,” Chief Executive Officer Charles Moorman said in March at the JPMorgan Aviation, Transportation
and Defense Conference.  The company said an unfavorable insurance arbitration
ruling reduced net income by 10 cents a share.  Norfolk Southern rose as much as $2.59, or 3.8 percent, to
$71 in late trading at 4:25 p.m. New York time, after the
company reported results. Earlier, the shares slipped 1 cent to
$68.41 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have
climbed 8.9 percent through today’s NYSE close.  Norfolk Southern said coal-shipping sales gained 30 percent
to $816 million in the quarter, while revenue from intermodal
shipments, which can move by rail, highway and sea, advanced 18
percent to $485 million.  Norfolk Southern said fuel expenses surged 53 percent to
$389 million in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
