Philippine  government bonds  rose,
driving yields on the January 2014 note to three-month lows,
after official data showed the  budget deficit  narrowed last
month. The peso advanced.  The shortfall was 18.1 billion pesos ($420 million) in
March from 21.5 billion pesos the month before and 63.9 billion
pesos in March 2010, the government said in an e-mailed
statement today. The first-quarter deficit was 26.2 billion
pesos, less than the administration’s target of 112 billion
pesos and the shortfall of 134.2 billion pesos in the three
months through March 2010.  The lower deficit “is already being implied in bond
yields,” said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president and
treasurer at Security Bank Corp. in Manila.  The yield on the 6.25 percent note due January 2014 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.55 percent as
of 5:11 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tradition Financial
Services. That was the lowest since Jan. 17.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 43.215 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency touched 43.001 on
April 11, matching the weakest level since Nov. 8.  “The next focus will be the April inflation data and the
policy meeting next week,” Algarra said. The statistics office
will report this month’s inflation data on May 5, the same day
the central bank will review  interest rates .  To contact the reporter for this story:
