U.S. stocks erased gains as
declines in energy and commodity companies overshadowed higher-
than-estimated earnings at companies from Corning Inc. to
Whirlpool Corp.  ConocoPhillips and Schlumberger Ltd. lost at least 1.7
percent to lead losses in energy producers as  oil prices 
retreated. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. paced losses in
mining companies as copper prices slumped. Corning and Whirlpool
advanced at least 0.5 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,346.19 at 10:12 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as
much as 0.2 percent earlier and reaching the highest level since
June 2008 yesterday. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 11.58
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,606.95, paring a 30-point advance.  The S&P 500 rallied 29 percent through yesterday after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  suggested on Aug. 27
that he would pursue a second round of asset purchases to
stimulate the economy, a tactic known as quantitative easing.
Earnings per share beat estimates at more than three-quarters of
the 197  S&P 500  companies that have reported quarterly results
since April 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fed officials will probably prepare to pull back from
record stimulus by dropping a pledge this year to hold the main
interest rate near zero for an “extended period,” according to
a Bloomberg News survey. Chairman Bernanke, who gives his first
press conference today after a meeting of policy makers, has
signaled he wants to ensure the U.S. economy has achieved self-
sustaining growth before the Fed starts to raise borrowing costs
and trim its $2.69-trillion balance sheet.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will release its
statement at 12:30 p.m. in Washington at the end of a two-day
meeting. After prior meetings, the FOMC released the statement
at 2:15 p.m. Instead, Bernanke is scheduled to hold a press
conference at that time. The Fed will release economic
projections of policy makers three weeks earlier than its
practice since 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
