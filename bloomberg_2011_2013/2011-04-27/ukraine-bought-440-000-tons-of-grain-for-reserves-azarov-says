Ukraine bought 440,000 metric tons
of grain for state reserves as part of efforts to control food
prices, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said.  The cabinet’s “task No. 1 is to be prepared to minimize
price fluctuation for food,” Azarov said during a weekly
government meeting today in the capital, Kiev.  The state-run Agrarian Fund, which makes the purchases and
sells to producers at low prices, said in February it planned to
buy 1.2 million tons of the 2011 harvest for the reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
