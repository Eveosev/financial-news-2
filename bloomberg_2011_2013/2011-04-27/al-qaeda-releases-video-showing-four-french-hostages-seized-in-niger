An al-Qaeda offshoot released a
video showing four French hostages who have been held for seven
months in the  Sahara desert , SITE Monitoring Services said on
its website.  In the three-minute video, the four men separately asked
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  to withdraw French troops from
Afghanistan. The videos were recorded April 11, 12 and 13, the
hostages said.  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates across the
Sahara, kidnapped seven people near a uranium mine in Niger on
Sept. 16. In February, they released a French woman as well as a
citizen of Togo and one from Madagascar.  The video is still being authenticated, European Affairs
Minister Laurent Wauquiez said in an interview on RMC Radio.  “We are doing everything to win the release of the
hostages, but hostage-takers don’t determine French foreign
policy,” he said. “I won’t say anything more.”  France  has about 4,000 troops in Afghanistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
