(Corrects credit rating in third paragraph.)  Uruguay hired two banks to arrange
meetings with Japanese debt investors next month as the South
American country considers selling Samurai bonds, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. and Nomura Securities
Co. are arranging talks planned for the week of May 16, said the
person, asking not to be identified as the information is
private. The bonds would be guaranteed by  Japan  Bank for
International Cooperation, the person said.  Uruguay is rated Ba1 by Moody’s Investors Service, the risk
assessor’s highest non-investment grade, while JBIC is ranked
Aa2, the third-highest investment grade, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Samurai bonds are yen-denominated notes
sold in Japan by overseas borrowers.  ---Editor: Ed Johnson  To contact the reporters on this story:
