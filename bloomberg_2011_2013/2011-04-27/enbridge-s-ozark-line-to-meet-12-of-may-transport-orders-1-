Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said its Ozark
pipeline, which moves heavy and low-sulfur oils between Cushing,
Oklahoma, and Wood River,  Illinois , will be able to meet 12
percent of requests for transport next month.  Producers, traders and refiners will move 226,350 barrels a
day on the Ozark line, compared with nominations to transport
1.93 million, Larry Springer, a spokesman for  Canada ’s largest
pipeline company, said today in an e-mail. Ozark was scheduled
to move 231,846 barrels a day in April, when the company said it
would also meet 12 percent of demand.  Enbridge’s  Spearhead  oil pipeline, which transports mostly
heavy Canadian oil in the central U.S., isn’t apportioned and
has capacity available, he said. Initial nominations were 91,646
barrels a day out of a capacity of 169,722.  Shippers sometimes inflate nominations to make sure they
obtain the space needed to transport their oil, and the company
must determine how many requests it can meet.  Spearhead was scheduled to move 139,184 barrels a day in
April, based on initial nominations, and wasn’t apportioned. The
Spearhead line spans 657 miles (1,058 kilometers) from  Chicago 
to Cushing, according to the company’s website.  Ozark is part of Enbridge’s  Mid-Continent System , which
includes more than 480 miles of oil pipelines and 12.8 million
barrels of storage, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
