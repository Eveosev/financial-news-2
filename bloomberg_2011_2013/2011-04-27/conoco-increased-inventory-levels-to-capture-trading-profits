ConocoPhillips (COP)  increased inventory
levels during the first quarter to capture trading profits, a
company executive said during an earnings conference call.  “We’re in a market buying crude for our refineries and
selling products both from our refineries and our upstream
assets,” said Jeff Sheets, the company’s chief financial
officer. Conoco profited by capturing “arbitrage and blending
opportunities in the market,” he said.  Trading contributed about $50 million in the first quarter
to refining and marketing earnings, according to Sheets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
