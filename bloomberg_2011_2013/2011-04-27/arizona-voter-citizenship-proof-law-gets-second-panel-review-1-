A federal appeals court voted to
reconsider its October ruling striking down a portion of
 Arizona ’s election law requiring residents to show proof of
citizenship.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in  San Francisco  agreed today to
have an 11-judge panel reconsider an earlier three-judge ruling
that the Arizona law conflicts with the National Voter
Registration Act.  The three-judge panel on Oct. 26 invalidated parts of
Arizona’s Proposition 200, a 2004 voter-approved initiative on
registration for state and federal elections. That ruling didn’t
disturb a requirement that voters show identification at the
polls.  In the earlier 2-1 decision, the judges said the proof-of-
citizenship requirement conflicted with the intent of the
federal law aiming to increase voter registration by
streamlining the process with a single form and removing state-
imposed obstacles to registration.  The law was challenged by  voting rights  and Hispanic
advocacy groups. Arizona officials sought reconsideration of the
October decision, which was granted today in a one-page order
from the court. No date has been set for the rehearing.  The case is Gonzalez v. Arizona, 08-17115,  U.S. Court of
Appeals  for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco).  To contact the reporters on this story:
