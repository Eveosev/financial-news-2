Hess Corp. (HES)  expects to average
40,000 barrels a day of oil production this year from wells in
 North Dakota ’s Bakken shale formation.  Wells located on new acreage “exceeded expectations,”
Greg Hill, president of exploration and production at the New
York-based company, said today on a conference call with
investors.  Bakken production averaged 25,000 barrels a day in the
first quarter, Chief Executive Officer John Hess said on the
call. Production was equivalent to 13,000 barrels a day in the
same period last year, Hess reported.  The company has 18 rigs drilling in the Bakken, mostly on
leases acquired last year in a $1.05 billion purchase from TRZ
Energy LLC and in the $336.9 million acquisition of American Oil
& Gas Inc.  Hess rose $3.25, or 4 percent, to $83.92 at 11:30 a.m. in
 New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. A close at that price
would be the largest one-day gain in two months. Before today,
the shares had risen 5.4 percent this year.  Off the coast of Ghana, instrument readings overnight
showed two layers of hydrocarbons totaling 370 feet (113 meters)
thick in the Paradise field, Hill said. It’s too early to assess
how much oil or gas the field may hold, he said.  Hess, which is paying the cost of the well, plans to drill
an additional 1,100 feet to a total depth of about 7,138 feet to
seek another hydrocarbon-bearing layer, Hill said. Hess has
rights to 90 percent of production and  Ghana  National Petroleum
Corp. has 10 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
