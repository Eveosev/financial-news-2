Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. lender, plans to hire about 500 people globally, including
bankers and traders, to bolster its institutional-clients unit.  The additions are “part of a multiyear effort, across all
businesses and geographies” within the division, spokeswoman
Danielle Romero-Apsilos said yesterday in an e-mail. The
institutional-clients unit includes  investment banking , trading,
transaction processing and the New York-based firm’s private
bank, which manages money for affluent customers.  Citigroup aims to rank among the top three firms in most
product areas, the Financial Times reported yesterday, citing an
interview with Chief Operating Officer  John Havens . Romero-
Apsilos confirmed the quote, and declined to comment further.  The new hires represent about 2 percent of the workforce in
the institutional-client group, the Financial Times said. The
division has more than 24,000 employees, the newspaper reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The institutional-clients group generated $8.56 billion in
first-quarter revenue, an 18 percent decline from a year
earlier, Citigroup said this month in a  presentation . Havens
oversaw the institutional-clients group before being named COO
by Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  in January.  Among global equity underwriters, Citigroup ranks sixth
this year, and fourth in U.S. bond underwriting, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. In 2007, the bank placed first in
both categories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
