Sugar fell for a third straight day
after  Thailand , the world’s biggest exporter after  Brazil , said
shipments will rise more than forecast to a record. Coffee and
cocoa also declined.  Thailand’s Office of the Cane & Sugar Board said today that
production will increase 37 percent to 9.47 million metric tons
because rainfall has improved yields. Before today, raw-sugar
futures plunged 36 percent from a 30-year high in February on
concern that rising supplies would ease a global production
deficit.  “Seeing a surge from Thailand adds a bearish sentiment to
sugar,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures in
Tampa. “It kind of washed out the market.”  Raw sugar for July delivery slid 0.14 cent, or 0.6 percent,
to 23.1 cents a pound at 10:40 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . In  London , refined-sugar futures for August delivery fell
$5.40, or 0.9 percent, to $627.70 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for July delivery slipped $7, or 0.2 percent,
to $3,086 a ton ICE. In London, cocoa for July delivery dropped
12 pounds, or 0.6 percent, to 1,895 pounds ($3,135) a ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery slipped 1.9 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $2.944 a pound in New York. Robusta-coffee
futures for July delivery rose $39, or 1.6 percent, to $2,541 a
ton in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
