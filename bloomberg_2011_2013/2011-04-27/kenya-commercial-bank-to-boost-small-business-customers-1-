Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
East African nation’s biggest lender by outlets, said it plans
to boost its number of small-business customers by 30 percent to
100,000 this year.  The bank targets an increase in lending to small businesses
to 15 billion shillings ($179 million) from 9.6 billion
shillings, according to an e-mailed statement from the Nairobi-
based company.  “Today, we have in excess of 18 billion shillings in
deposits entrusted to us” by small and medium-sized companies,
Peter Munyiri, the company’s deputy chief executive officer,
said in the statement. “This together with the 12.5 billion
shillings capital raised in the successful rights issue last
year, puts KCB in a highly liquid position to lend favorably to
the sector.”  KCB, as the lender is known, plans to increase deposits it
takes from the sector to 30 billion shillings by the end of
2011, Munyiri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
