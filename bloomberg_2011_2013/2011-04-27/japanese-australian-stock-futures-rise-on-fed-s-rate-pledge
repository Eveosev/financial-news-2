Japanese stock futures rose after
the U.S. Federal Reserve renewed its pledge to stimulate growth
in the world’s biggest economy with low interest rates.
Australian stocks futures gained.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest manufacturer of cameras, climbed 0.5 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a Japanese
electronics maker that derives more than half of its sales
abroad, increased 1.7 percent. ADRs of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,
Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas producer, gained 0.3
percent after crude prices increased.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,730 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,710
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,740 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index advanced 0.8 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
gained 0.4 percent in Wellington.  “The U.S. will continue its easing monetary policy as was
expected,” said Toshio Sumitani, a strategist at Tokai  Tokyo 
Research Center. “Stocks in the U.S. are rising with support
from the easing policy, as they are cheap. Gains in U.S. stocks
are positive for other stock markets.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In  New York  yesterday, the index rose 0.6 percent
to 1,355.66. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled
the Fed will maintain its record monetary stimulus after ending
large-scale bond purchases in June, while the need to contain
inflation means further easing is unlikely.  Rate Unchanged  The Fed left its benchmark interest rate in a range of zero
to 0.25 percent, where it’s been since December 2008.  Bernanke reinforced the view of the  Federal Open Market
Committee , which released its policy statement yesterday, that
borrowing costs are likely to stay low for “an extended
period.” The panel agreed to finish $600 billion of Treasury
purchases in June and said surging commodity prices will
probably have a transitory effect on inflation.  A report from the Commerce Department said that orders for
U.S. durable goods rose in March for a third consecutive month,
showing businesses intend to keep spending to update equipment.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased just 0.1 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with gains of 7.8 percent by
the S&P 500 and 2.3 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.8 times for the S&P 500
and 11.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude Oil  Crude oil for June delivery increased 0.5 percent to
$112.76 a barrel in New York yesterday, the highest settlement
since April 8.  The yen depreciated to 82.79 against the dollar, compared
with 81.68 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the euro,  Japan ’s currency weakened to 121.55 from
119.93. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  In Japan, economic data including the unemployment rate and
consumer prices will be announced at 8:30 a.m. and industrial
production at 8:50 a.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
