European Union emission allowances
increased to their highest price in 12 days, tracking German
power for 2012.  EU carbon permits for December advanced 1.2 percent to
close at 17.10 euros ($25) a metric ton on  London â€™s ICE Futures
Europe exchange, the highest since April 15. They were as high
as 17.14 euros earlier today, having jumped 20 percent this year
as utilities bought permits to hedge forward sales of
electricity through 2014 and beyond.  German power for 2012 gained 0.9 percent to 58.70 euros a
megawatt-hour, according to prices from brokers compiled by
Bloomberg. Northwest Europe coal for next year climbed 1.2
percent to $131 a ton as  oil prices  advanced.  Factories and power stations in the program must have
enough allowances in their registry accounts to match 2010
emissions at the end of April. The discount of United Nations
Certified Emission Reduction credits for December widened 2.3
percent to 3.93 euros a ton, the biggest since April 8 on ICE.  Trading on BlueNext, the spot exchange in Paris, more than
doubled to 470,000 tons, the most since April 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
