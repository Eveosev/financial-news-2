European stocks advanced for a
fifth day, led by technology and auto-industry shares, as
companies from Ericsson AB to  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and Porsche SE
reported better-than-estimated earnings.  Ericsson surged 11 percent as the biggest maker of mobile-
phone networks reported first-quarter profit that more than
tripled. Volkswagen,  Europe ’s largest carmaker, climbed 4.8
percent. Porsche rallied 5.9 percent after its car-making
division reported increased income.  Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the world’s
second-largest truckmaker, rose 2.1 percent after lifting this
year’s industry sales forecasts.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.3 percent to
282.12 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , the highest level in
almost eight weeks. The gauge has advanced 7.6 percent from this
year’s low on March 16 as results from  Intel Corp . to PSA
Peugeot Citroen spurred speculation that the economic recovery
is on track.  “We’re quite happy with the earnings season,” Lothar Mentel, who oversees about $3.2 billion as the London-based
chief investment officer at Octopus Investments Ltd., said on
Bloomberg Television’s “On the Move” with  Francine Lacqua .
“We know the first quarter has been good.”  Of the 61 Stoxx 600 companies that have reported earnings
since April 11, 66 percent have announced positive surprises,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Benchmark Indexes  National benchmark indexes rose in 12 of the 18 western
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 gained 0.6 percent and
 Germany ’s DAX climbed 0.7 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was
little changed.  Greece ’s ASE Index slid 1.8 percent as the yield on the
nation’s two-year bonds rose above 25 percent for the first
time.  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE) , the country’s biggest lender,
declined 5.3 percent to 5.05 euros, the lowest in eight years.  European stocks erased an earlier drop as a report showed
Britain’s economy rebounded in the first quarter by enough to
erase the contraction of the previous three months on the
strongest surge in service industry growth for four years.  Gross domestic product rose 0.5 percent from the previous
three months, when it fell by the same amount, the  Office for
National Statistics  said. The result matched the median forecast
of 28 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Ericsson Earnings  Ericsson surged 11 percent to 89.10 kronor, the biggest
increase since January 2009. First-quarter net income reached
4.1 billion kronor ($675 million), compared with 1.3 billion
kronor a year earlier, the company said. Analysts had predicted
profit of 3.06 billion kronor.  VW climbed 4.8 percent to 126.50 euros, pacing a gauge of
auto shares to the second-largest gain among 19 industry groups
in the Stoxx 600. The carmaker said first-quarter net income
increased to 1.71 billion euros ($2.51 billion) from 473 million
euros a year earlier. Profit beat the 1.63 billion-euro average
of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Porsche rallied 5.9 percent to 47.87 euros as its car-
making division reported a first-quarter profit gain after a
revamp of the Cayenne boosted demand for the sport-utility
vehicle. Earnings before interest and tax “more than doubled”
to 496 million euros, the Stuttgart, Germany-based company said
today, without providing a year-earlier figure.  Volvo, Renault  Volvo advanced 2.1 percent to 116 kronor as the truckmaker
raised its 2011 sales forecasts for Europe and  North America .
The company now expects industrywide deliveries in both regions
of 230,000 to 240,000 trucks. The previous forecast was sales of
220,000 vehicles in both regions. The company said first-quarter
net income rose to 4.09 billion kronor, topping the 3.48
billion-krona estimate in a survey of analysts.  Renault SA (RNO)  climbed 3.8 percent to 40.92 euros. France’s
second-biggest carmaker said revenue increased to 10.43 billion
euros in the first three months from 9.07 billion euros a year
earlier. That beat the 9.5 billion-euro median of six analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  gained 3.3 percent to 6.16 euros as the world’s
largest maker of mobile phones agreed to farm out its Symbian
software development to  Accenture Plc  as part of a job-reduction
program as it switches to Microsoft Corp.’s platform.  Software AG (SOW)  advanced 3 percent to 126.55 euros. Germany’s
second-biggest maker of  business software  said first-quarter
profit jumped 43 percent to 40 million euros, helped by cost
savings from the integration of its IDS Scheer consulting
business and a weaker euro. Earnings surpassed the 37.1 million-
euro average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  DSM, Glaxo  Royal DSM NV soared 4.9 percent to 45.55 euros after the
Dutch vitamin and polymers maker reported first-quarter earnings
that beat analysts’ forecasts and predicted 2011 will be
“strong.”  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  added 2.1 percent to 1,286.5 pence, the
highest price since October. The U.K.’s biggest drugmaker said
first-quarter profit climbed 14 percent, lifted by a gain from
the sale of its stake in Quest Diagnostics Inc.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  limited gains in the Stoxx 600, sliding 4.8
percent to 287.5 pence. The U.K.’s third-largest bank by assets
said first-quarter net income fell to 1.01 billion pounds ($1.67
billion), as revenue from its investment banking unit declined
by 15 percent. That missed the average analyst estimate for
profit of 1.21 billion pounds.  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)  sank 5.8 percent to 984 pence
after the owner of Primark clothes stores cut its full-year
profit forecast as profitability at its clothing unit will be
lower than previously anticipated.  Straumann Holding AG (STMN)  tumbled 5.1 percent to 227.3 Swiss
francs. The Swiss maker of dental implants said first-quarter
sales fell 5.4 percent to 188.4 million francs ($216 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
