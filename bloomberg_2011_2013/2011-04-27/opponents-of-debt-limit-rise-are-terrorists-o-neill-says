Former Treasury Secretary  Paul O’Neill  said members of Congress who threaten to oppose an
increase in the federal debt limit are “terrorists” who are
putting the government’s credit rating at risk.  “I think the people who threaten not to pass the debt
ceiling are our version of al-Qaeda terrorists,” O’Neill said
in an interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness
With Margaret Brennan” program. “They’re really putting our
whole society at risk by threatening to round up 50 percent of
the members of Congress -- who are loony -- who would put our
credit at risk.”  Republicans are demanding major spending reductions as the
price of their votes to raise the $14.3 trillion debt limit. The
Treasury Department projects that it will reach the cap on May
16, though it could use accounting moves to avoid default until
about July 8.  O’Neill was President  George W. Bush ’s first Treasury
secretary and was fired in December 2002 after criticizing the
administration’s tax cuts as well as making a series of
controversial remarks.  “The Congress needs to be responsible and adult and take
action,” O’Neill said today. “This is not about permitting
spending in the future. This is permitting us to pay the bills
we’ve already incurred. This whole conversation is
irresponsible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
