Romania  will probably meet all the
targets set for its International Monetary Fund review and the
country’s economic data look “promising,” said Jeffrey Franks,
the lender’s mission chief in the country.  “Our expectations are that most of the program targets
were meet,” Franks told reporters in Bucharest today, at the
beginning of the fund’s first review mission under Romania’s new
precautionary loan agreement. “The preliminary data look
promising, but we have to leave our experts to do their job.”  The IMF will probably revise its economic forecast at the
end of its visit to the country, Franks said. The review will
focus on state companies and the government’s progress in its
economic overhaul, he said.  Romania received IMF approval for a two-year precautionary
standby agreement valued at 3.5 billion euros as part of efforts
to reassure investors that austerity measures will continue
through elections next year. A 20 billion-euro bailout that also
included the European Union expires this month.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, is
performing the last review under the country’s previous
agreement. Following the review, the Commission will decide to
disburse the last tranche of 150 million euros to the state
budget. Romania fulfilled all the conditions for the last
disbursement from the EU, Finance Minister Gheorghe Ialomitianu
said today after a government meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
