The number of jobseekers in  France 
fell for a third month in March as signs of an accelerating
economic recovery prompted hiring.  The total of unemployed people actively looking for work
dropped by 21,100, or 0.8 percent, from the previous month, the
Labor and Finance ministries said in a joint statement in Paris
today. The total number of jobseekers was 2.68 million, down
from 2.701 million in February.  With French exporters benefiting from demand in Asia and
the U.S. and industrial output increasing, companies including
 LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  have begun taking on new
workers. Even so, President  Nicolas Sarkozy  needs to press
harder to cut joblessness, which reached a seven-year high of
2.725 million reached in December, according to the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.  “Efforts must be continued to overcome the main job-market
weaknesses,” the OECD said in a report on France published on
April 11. “An onerous level of labor taxation, on top of a high
 minimum wage ” and “poor” dialogue between unions and
management are issues that could be addressed to create jobs,
the OECD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
