Chinese officials told Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  and nine other visiting U.S. senators
that the yuan’s “managed appreciation” will continue,
according to a statement on Reid’s Web site.  The senators urged  China  to “be more aggressive” in
allowing the yuan, which has risen more than 4 percent against
the dollar in the past 10 months, to strengthen, the statement
said. The group met with leaders including Vice President Xi Jinping and People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan.  “Chinese officials confirmed that China would continue the
managed appreciation of its currency and were urged by the
delegation to be more aggressive,” the statement said.  “This was an important step because China’s currency
policy has resulted in an unbalanced  exchange rate  that keeps
the cost of Chinese products artificially low and the cost of
U.S. exports to China unfairly high, making it difficult for
U.S. businesses to compete with China in the global
marketplace,” the statement said.  Lawmakers are considering legislation that would make it
easier for U.S. companies to seek legal remedies against Chinese
competitors if the yuan doesn’t appreciate. Such a measure
passed the U.S. House in the previous Democrat-led Congress,
then stalled in the Senate.  The senators spent a week in China, returning to the U.S.
on April 25. Reid, a Nevada Democrat, was accompanied by
Senators Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat,  Charles Schumer ,
a New York Democrat, and  Richard Shelby , an Alabama Republican,
among others.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
