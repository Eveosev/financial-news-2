Middle East crude oils rose on
signs that refiners are boosting output amid gains in processing
profits.  Oman oil for immediate loading rose 17 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $118.39 a barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai for loading in June gained 0.1 percent to
$117.86 and Murban crude climbed 0.1 percent to $122.56.  Gasoilâ€™s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of the profit
from producing the fuel, was at $19.74 a barrel today, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd, a broker based in  London . That has
nearly doubled from a year earlier.  Asian refiners are being deterred from buying alternative
crudes priced against the Brent benchmark as the grade has
climbed relative to Dubai oil in the  Persian Gulf , said three
traders who participate in the market. The Brent-Dubai exchange
for swaps for June dropped 13 cents to $6.85 a barrel, PVM data
showed. The exchange for swaps for July declined 12 cents to
$6.82 a barrel.  Oman futures for June delivery advanced 30 cents to $118.20
a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:46 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,017 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$117.78 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
