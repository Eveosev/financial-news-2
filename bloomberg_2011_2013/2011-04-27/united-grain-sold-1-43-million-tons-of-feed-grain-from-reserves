United Grain Co. , the Russian state
grain trader, has sold 1.43 million metric tons of feed grain to
3,000 livestock farms and animal feed producers between April 7
and today, the company said in an e-mailed press release.  United Grain plans to sell an additional 124,290 tons of
feed grain in six regions of the country by the end of April, it
said.  The sales, at low-fixed prices, were ordered by the
government on March 24 to support livestock farmers after grain
prices increased due to last yearâ€™s drought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
