Kuwait favors oil price stability
and the “unjustifiable” rise in prices is a cause of concern
for consumers and producers,  KUNA  reported, citing Kuwait Oil
Co. Chairman Sami al-Rushaid.  A surge that isn’t backed by supply and demand most likely
will lead to an abrupt fall in prices that isn’t favorable to
the market, al-Rushaid told the state news agency.  Al-Rushaid also said the recent rise in  oil prices  can be
attributed to speculation rather than market fundamentals and
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries can compensate
for the loss of Libyan oil on the market, KUNA reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
