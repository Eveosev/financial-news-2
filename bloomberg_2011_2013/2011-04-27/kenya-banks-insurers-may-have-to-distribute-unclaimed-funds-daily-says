A proposed Kenyan law may force
banks, insurers and pension funds to distribute more than 200
billion shillings ($2.39 billion) of unclaimed money in the
financial system, Business Daily reported.  Under the legislation, holders of the assets face fines
unless the owners are traced and refunded, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said. Assets that donâ€™t revert to their owners will be
acquired by the government and used in social programs, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
