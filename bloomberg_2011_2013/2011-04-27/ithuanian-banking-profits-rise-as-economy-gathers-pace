Lithuanian banks posted profits for
a third consecutive quarter as economic recovery gathers paces,
the central bank said.  The country’s banks had a combined profit of 254.6 million
litai ($108 million), compared with a loss of 232.3 million
litai the first quarter of 2010, the Vilnius-based Lietuvos
Bankas said on its  website  today.  Profitability in the nation’s banking industry is
strengthening after lenders reversed almost two years of losses
in the third quarter. Economic output expanded 4.8 percent in
the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
