Denver Broncos linebacker Jason Hunter is in stable condition at a Detroit area hospital after
being stabbed by a female acquaintance, police said.  The case comes five days after former Broncos receiver
Brandon Marshall, now with the  Miami Dolphins , was stabbed,
allegedly by his wife with a kitchen knife, according to ESPN.  The Broncos said in a statement that they hope Hunter makes
a quick recovery and won’t comment further until they gather
more information.  Detroit police said an investigation of Hunter’s stabbing
continues. They couldn’t provide information on where the
incident occurred or specifics on his injury. Samuel Balogun, a
spokesman for the Detroit Police Department, said in a telephone
interview that the assailant is a “female friend” of Hunter’s
who police believe may have been his girlfriend.  Hunter, 27, appeared in 16 games for the Broncos last
season, with 61 tackles, three sacks and an interception. He
played with the  Detroit Lions  in 2009 after spending his first
three NFL seasons with the  Green Bay Packers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
