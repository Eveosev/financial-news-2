Ukraine’s state debt, including
guarantees, rose 0.35 percent in March,  Finance Ministry  said.  The debt reached $56.4 billion as of March 31, compared
with $56.2 billion at the end of February, the Kiev-based
ministry said in a  statement  on its website late yesterday.  Domestic debt rose to $18.56 billion as of the end of March
from $17.77 billion a month earlier, the ministry said. Debt to
foreign borrowers declined to $24.1 billion from $24.7 billion,
according to the statement.  Ukrainian government has to improve its pension system and
find ways to offset a slower-than-expected increase in utility
bills in order to continue a loan program with the  International
Monetary Fund . The country received $3.4 billion in two tranches
last year of the $15.6 billion bailout program. The third
tranche, which was due by the end of March, is being delayed.  The government seeks to reduce  budget deficit  next year to
2.5 percent of gross domestic product and to keep the gap at
about 3 percent of GDP this year, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov 
said on April 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
