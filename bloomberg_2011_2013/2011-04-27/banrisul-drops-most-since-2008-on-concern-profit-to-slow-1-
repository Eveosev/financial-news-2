Brazilian lender  Banco do Estado do
Rio Grande do Sul (BRSR5)  SA dropped the most since November 2008 after
the nation’s credit expansion eased and Barclays Plc cut its
stock rating on concern earnings growth will slow.  Banrisul, as the Porto Alegre-based bank is known, fell 6.5
percent to 18.60 reais at the 4:15 p.m. New York time close and
is down 11 percent from a record high on April 25.  Brazilian lending expanded in March at the second-slowest
pace in 13 months as the government curbed  consumer credit  to
slow inflation, a central bank report showed today. Barclays
lowered its recommendation on Banrisul to “underweight” from
“equal weight,” saying profit growth may flag after the market
for loan portfolios stalled following rival Banco Panamericano
SA’s bailout. Portfolio purchases accounted for 43 percent of
Banrisul’s retail growth last year, Barclays said.  “Given that this market has undergone serious changes in
the last six months, which led to an almost halt of loan
portfolio purchases at this point, we suspect Banrisul may not
find opportunities to expand credit faster than an organic
pace,” Fabio Zagatti, an analyst at Barclays in  Sao Paulo ,
wrote in a note to clients today. “Risks of decelerating
earnings growth are mounting.”  Panamericano’s total 4.3 billion reais ($2.7 billion) in
accounting losses, which sparked two bailouts since November,
stemmed from loan holdings that were sold without being
subtracted from the balance sheet.  Banrisul led industry declines today as MSCI Inc.’s gauge
of Brazilian financial shares slipped 1.2 percent to 962.99.
 Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , Brazil’s second-biggest bank by market value,
dropped 1.6 percent to 31.85 reais after posting adjusted first-
quarter profit of 2.74 billion reais, in line with the average
estimate of 2.75 billion reais in a Bloomberg survey of four
analysts. Panamericano rose 0.9 percent to 5.60 reais.  Brazil ’s total outstanding credit rose 1 percent in March
to 1.75 trillion reais from the previous month, the central bank
said in a report distributed today in Brasilia. Growth was 1.3
percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
