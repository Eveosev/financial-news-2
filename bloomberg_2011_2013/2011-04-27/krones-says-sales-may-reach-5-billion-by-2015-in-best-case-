Krones AG (KRN) , the world’s biggest
maker of bottling and packaging equipment, said sales may rise
as much as 59 percent by 2015 as the company focuses on
innovation and high-growth markets.  Sales may reach 3.45 billion euros ($5.06 billion) by 2015
in the “best case," Hans-Juergen Thaus, the deputy chief
executive officer, will say at a press conference in Munich
today, according to the text of his speech sent to journalists.
The company expects annual sales to grow by about 7 percent per
year through 2015, and sales may reach as much as 2.6 billion
euros this year, he said.  Krones, whose clients include breweries and soft-drink
producers, is benefiting from improved expectations for global
growth and sees profit before taxes exceeding 5 percent of sales
this year and reaching 7 percent in 2012.  The company, based in Neutraubling, north of Munich, had
sales of 2.17 billion euros last year. Krones said today that
revenue in this year’s first three months rose 14 percent to
606.7 million euros, a first-quarter record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
