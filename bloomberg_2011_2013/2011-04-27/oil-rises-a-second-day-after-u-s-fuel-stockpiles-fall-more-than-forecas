Oil climbed for a second day in  New
York  on speculation fuel demand will increase after the  Federal
Reserve  renewed its pledge to stimulate growth and as U.S.
gasoline stockpiles fell to the lowest since August 2009.  Futures rose to a 31-month intraday high today after
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled the Fed will maintain its
record monetary stimulus. The Energy Department said gasoline
inventories fell 2.51 million barrels to 205.6 million last
week, declining for the 10th week. They were projected to drop 1
million barrels, said analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “All of Bernanke’s comments were reassuring to the market,
that  interest rates  will stay low and the economy is
recovering,” said  Victor Shum , a senior principal at energy
consultants Purvin & Gertz Inc. in  Singapore . “His statement
and the gasoline inventory draw provided the effect that’s
driving the market now.”  Crude oil for June delivery gained as much as 94 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $113.70 a barrel in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest since Sept. 22, 2008.
The contract was at $113.28 at 2:45 p.m. Singapore time.
Yesterday, it climbed 55 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $112.76.
Prices are 36 percent higher than a year earlier.  Brent oil for June settlement increased 46 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $125.59 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Yesterday, it rose 99 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$125.13, the highest close since April 8.  Brent Premium  The European crude benchmark traded at a premium of $12.37
a barrel to U.S. futures yesterday. The difference between
front-month contracts in  London  and New York surged to a record
$19.54 on Feb. 21. The spread averaged 76 cents last year.  Oil climbed after the Federal Reserve renewed its pledge to
stimulate growth with low interest rates and said a pickup in
inflation is likely to be temporary. The Fed announcement
bolstered equities and sent the dollar lower.  The Fed “said it would complete its latest $600 billion
bond-buying program in June as scheduled and it would keep
interest rates low for an extended period, which was positive
for commodities,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Melbourne , said in
an e-mailed note today. The Energy Department report “was seen
as positive by the market,” he said.  The Energy Department report showed U.S. stockpiles of
distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, declined 1.81 million barrels to 146.5 million last
week. Crude supplies in the world’s largest oil-consuming nation
climbed 6.16 million barrels, the report showed.  Middle East  Demand in the world’s largest oil consumer averaged 19.3
million barrels over the past four weeks, the Energy Department
said. That’s the highest since the period ending March 11.  Oil has advanced 24 percent in New York this year. Unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa has toppled leaders in Egypt
and Tunisia and spread to  Libya , Algeria, Bahrain,  Iran , Oman,
Syria and Yemen.  Gasoline for May delivery rose for a sixth day, gaining
2.63 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.4457 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The record was $3.571 on July 3, 2008.
