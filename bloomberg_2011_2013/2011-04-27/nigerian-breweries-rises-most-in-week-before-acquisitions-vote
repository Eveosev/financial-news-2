Nigerian Breweries Plc (NB) , the
country’s biggest brewer by market value, rose the most in more
than a week after it said shareholders will vote on its planned
acquisition of two other brewers.  The stock gained 72 kobo, or 0.8 percent, to 86.50 naira by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the commercial capital. That’s the
highest since April 18.  Shareholders will decide whether to approve the plan to
acquire Sona Systems Associates Business Management Ltd. and
Life Breweries at a May 18 annual general meeting, the company
said in a statement published in the Lagos-based Punch newspaper
today.  Nigerian Breweries has outpaced the stock exchange’s All-
Share Index this year, rising 12 percent against the bourse’s
2.5 percent climb.  To contact the reporter on this story:
