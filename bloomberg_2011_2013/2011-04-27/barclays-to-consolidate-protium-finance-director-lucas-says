Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s third-
largest bank, said it was buying back 6.2 billion pounds ($10.2
billion) of assets from a fund set up by former employees in
2009 with a loan from the lender.  Barclays Financial Director Chris Lucas denied the move had
anything to do with “external pressure” from U.K. and U.S.
regulators who were considering making the bank include the debt
in its financial statements. Barclays said last month it was
“appropriate” not to consolidate Protium Finance LP on its
balance sheet.  Barclays sold the debt in 2009 to Protium, a fund run by
 Stephen King , former head of the bank’s principal mortgage
trading group, and Michael Keeley, who was a member of Barclays
Capital’s management committee, to reduce losses linked to
credit market volatility.  The bank took a 532 million-pound charge last year against
the loan provided to Protium, followed by a subsequent writeback
this year of 190 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
