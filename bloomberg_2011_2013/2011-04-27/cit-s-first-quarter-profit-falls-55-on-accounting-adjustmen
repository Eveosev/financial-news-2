CIT Group Inc. (CIT) , the commercial
lender run by John A. Thain, reported a 55 percent decrease in
first-quarter profit on an adjustment in post-bankruptcy
accounting.  Net income was $65.6 million, or 33 cents a share, down
from $144.6 million, or 72 cents, in the same period a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
The average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for profit of 18 cents.  CIT’s profit fell due to a $364 million decrease in net
“fresh-start accounting,” or FSA, balance-sheet adjustments
made when the firm exited bankruptcy in December 2009, according
to the statement. The decrease reflected fewer asset prepayments
and the accelerated repayment of debt carried at a discount, the
company said.  “We continue to make progress rebuilding CIT,” Thain, 55,
said in the statement. “We are advancing our bank strategy,
optimizing our portfolio, managing expenses and reducing our
cost of capital.”  CIT has reported a decline in net income for three
consecutive quarters as Thain, the former Merrill Lynch & Co.
chief executive officer, has shrunk the company by selling non-
core assets. CIT, once the biggest independent commercial lender
in the U.S., is recovering from a bankruptcy that wiped out $2.3
billion in U.S. bailout money.  CIT shares rose 20 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $42.40
yesterday in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have fallen about 10 percent this year through yesterday.  Credit-Loss Provisions  Credit-loss provisions were $123.4 million, a 45 percent
decrease from the year-earlier period, according to the
statement. Net charge-offs increased to $140.6 million from
$77.5 million in the same period last year.  Net revenue decreased to $475.3 million from $676.8 million
in the first quarter of 2010, the company said. Average earning
assets, including loans and leases, decreased to $35 billion
from $45 billion. Total assets fell to $50.7 billion from $58.5
billion.  CIT announced last week that regulators lifted cease-and-
desist orders against its Salt Lake City-based bank that
prevented the company from boosting deposits or paying
dividends. The orders were issued by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the Utah Department of Financial
Institutions in July 2009.  The lifting of the orders, along with the firm’s first bond
offering since emerging from bankruptcy, show CIT is making
progress toward improving its debt rating,  Michael Taiano ,
managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said in a
note last week. CIT issued $2 billion of secured notes last
month, using the proceeds to repay debt coming due in 2013, the
company said at the time.  The firm is still required to submit to supervision by the
 Federal Reserve Bank of New York , which signed a written
agreement with CIT in August 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
