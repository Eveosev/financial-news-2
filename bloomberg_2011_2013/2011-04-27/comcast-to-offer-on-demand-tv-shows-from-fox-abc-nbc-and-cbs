Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  is adding more than
20 network TV shows to its on-demand service, giving customers a
broader option of recorded programming.  The largest U.S. cable-television company will include TV
series from  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC and News Corp.’s Fox for the
first time, including “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Glee,” the
Philadelphia-based company said in a statement. Comcast will
offer the four most recent episodes of each series on demand
beginning tomorrow.  Comcast is competing against other cable and satellite
providers and online sites including  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube and
Netflix Inc. for viewers and advertisers. With the show
additions, Comcast said it becomes the first pay-TV provider to
offer original series from NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox on demand.  “By nearly doubling the number of current TV series from
broadcast networks, Xfinity TV On Demand offers our customers a
one-of-a-kind experience that can’t be found elsewhere,” said
Marcien Jenckes, senior vice president and general manager of
video services, in the statement.  Comcast now offers nearly 600 series on demand, 56 of which
are from broadcast networks. Comcast rose 25 cents to $25.84 at
4 p.m.  New York  time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have
increased 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
