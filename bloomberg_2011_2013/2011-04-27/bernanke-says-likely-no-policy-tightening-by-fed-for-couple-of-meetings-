Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank’s pledge to keep interest rates
low for an “extended period” means there likely would be no
tightening of policy “for a couple of meetings.”  “Extended period suggests it would be a couple meetings,
probably, before action,” he said at a news conference today in
 Washington . “Unfortunately, the reason we use this vaguer
terminology is that we don’t know with certainty how quickly
response will be required.”  Bernanke was responding to a reporter who asked for his
definition of “extended period,” a phrase the Fed repeated
today to describe how long it’s likely to maintain
“exceptionally low” interest rates. The Fed has used the
phrase since March 2009.  The Fed chief added that he didn’t know “exactly how long
it will be before a tightening process begins.” The Fed today
left its benchmark interest rate in a range of zero to 0.25
percent, where it’s been since December 2008, and said it would
complete its purchases of $600 billion in Treasuries in June, as
planned.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
