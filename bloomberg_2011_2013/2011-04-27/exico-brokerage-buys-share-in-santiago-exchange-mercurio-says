Corporativo GBM SAB de CV, a
Mexican brokerage firm, bought a share in the Santiago
securities exchange, allowing it to operate as a broker in
 Chile ,  El Mercurio  reported.   GBM paid $5.2 million for the share, the Santiago-based
newspaper wrote, without saying where it got the information.
GBM already operates through Chile’s electronic exchange, El
Mercurio reported.   Carlos Albert, who heads GBM’s Chilean operations,
confirmed the information. GBM probably will begin operations on
the Santiago exchange in two or three weeks, he said by
telephone.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
