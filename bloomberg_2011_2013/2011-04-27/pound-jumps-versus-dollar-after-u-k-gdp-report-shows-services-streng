The pound gained and gilts fell
after a report showed Britain’s economy rebounded in the first
quarter on the strongest surge in service-industry growth for
four years.  Sterling snapped three days of declines versus the dollar
and euro. Gross domestic product grew 0.5 percent after
shrinking the same amount in the fourth quarter, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today, matching the median estimate of
28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Services, which make
up 76 percent of the economy, grew by 0.9 percent, the most
since 2006.  “The reaction that we’re seeing in the pound right now is
some kind of relief, because some thought the number would be
even weaker,” said  John Hydeskov , chief analyst at Danske Bank
A/S in  London .  The pound advanced against all but two of its 16 most
actively traded counterparts. Sterling rose 0.3 percent to
$1.6523 as of 4:31 p.m., extending its monthly gain versus the
greenback to 3.1 percent. It strengthened 0.2 percent to 88.67
pence per euro, after earlier depreciating to 89.23 pence, the
weakest level since April 13.  U.K. government bonds fell, pushing the 10-year yield up
nine basis points to 3.57 percent. That’s the biggest intraday
move since March 22. The 3.75 percent security due September
2020 slipped 0.68, or 6.8 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,656) face
amount, to 101.42. The two-year note yield rose 10 basis points
to 1.19 percent.  BOE Rate Speculation  Short-sterling futures dropped for the first day in four as
traders increased bets the  Bank of England  will boost borrowing
costs. The implied yield on the contract expiring in December
jumped by seven basis points to 1.23 percent, paring its monthly
decline.  Speculation the U.K. central bank will raise rates as early
as May pushed pound up 5.8 percent against the dollar this year.
Economists at Citigroup Inc., Nomura International Plc and
Barclays Plc last week changed their forecasts for an increase
from May to August, after minutes of the central bank’s April 7
meeting showed policy makers noted that recent economic data had
been on the “downside.”  Investors pushed back expectations of when the BOE will
announce its first 25 basis-point increase to November. Before
the minutes’ publication on April 20, the first move was
expected in October, according to the sterling overnight
interbank average compiled by Tullett Prebon Plc.  Gilts have earned investors 1.5 percent since the end of
March, compared with a 0.6 percent return on German bonds and
1.1 percent on  U.S. Treasuries , according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  The U.K. Debt Management Office will auction 4.5 billion
pounds of 28-, 90- and 181-day bills tomorrow. The DMO plans to
sell 167.5 billion pounds of debt this fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
