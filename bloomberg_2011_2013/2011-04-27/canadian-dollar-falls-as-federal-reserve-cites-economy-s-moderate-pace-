Canada ’s dollar traded at almost a
three-year high after the  Federal Reserve  decided to keep its
interest-rate target a record low levels and finish $600 billion
of bond purchases on schedule in June.  The Canadian currency erased losses amid forecasts the Fed
will be slower to boost  interest rates  than the  Bank of Canada .
The nation’s economy may have expanded 3.1 percent in February
from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg News survey of
economists before the April 29 report.  “The market’s going to look at this as business as usual -
- sell U.S. dollars,” said  John Curran , a senior vice president
in Toronto at CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign-exchange
dealer. “What might give it a bit of fuel is a strong Canadian
gross domestic product number on Friday.”  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, was little changed at 95.02
cents versus the greenback at 5:06 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.16
cents yesterday. It weakened earlier as much as 0.6 percent. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0524.  The Canadian dollar has appreciated 11.9 percent since the
end of June and touched 94.55 cents on April 21, the strongest
level since November 2007.  Fed Action  The Fed left its benchmark interest rate in a range of zero
to 0.25 percent, where it’s been since December 2008, and
retained a pledge in place since March 2009 to keep it
“exceptionally low” for an “extended period.” The central
bank will keep reinvesting proceeds of maturing mortgage debt
purchased in the first round of large-scale asset purchases that
lasted from December 2008 to March 2010.  The greenback remained lower against most of its other
major counterparts after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in
his first press conference after a policy decision that he
expects first-quarter economic growth to be “relatively weak.”  The U.S. central bank’s benchmark will increase to 0.5
percent during the first quarter of 2012, according to the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The Bank of Canada, which is forecast to boost the target
rate for overnight loans to 1.5 percent during the third quarter
and 2 percent during the last three months of 2011, according to
a separate survey. The central bank has held its benchmark
interest rate at 1 percent since September, when it increased it
for the third time last year. The next BOC meeting is May 31.  Bonds Fall  Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 10-year security up eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 3.27 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent
security maturing in June 2020 declined 64 cents to C$101.79.  The  New Democratic Party  has become the second-most popular
political party in Canada before the May 2 federal election,
three polls show.  The NDP has 30 percent support among decided voters,
according to an Angus Reid Public Opinion poll, conducted for
the Toronto Star and La Presse newspapers. The governing
 Conservative Party  has 35 percent support, while the Liberals,
who had the second-most seats in the House of Commons, have 22
percent. The online poll surveyed 2,040 Canadian adults on April
25 and 26. It carries a margin of error of 2.2 percent, 19 times
out of 20.  “The Harper government, whatever you want to say about
their domestic policies, their economic stewardship has been
very good,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX
Solutions in Saddle River,  New Jersey . “The currency market
certainty has that judgment.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
