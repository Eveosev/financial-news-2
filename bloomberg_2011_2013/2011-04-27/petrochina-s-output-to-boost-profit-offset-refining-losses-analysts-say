PetroChina Co.,  Asia ’s biggest
company by market value, will benefit from higher oil and gas
production this year as government controls on diesel and
gasoline prices lead to refining losses, analysts said.  The Beijing-based company said yesterday first-quarter
profit rose 14 percent from a year earlier to 37 billion yuan
($5.7 billion). The earnings missed the median forecast of 38.4
billion yuan in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts, after fuel
price increases lagged behind crude oil costs.  “The upstream business is the real driver for PetroChina
earnings, and it will have a better year than 2010,”  Neil Beveridge , a Hong Kong-based senior oil-and-gas analyst at
brokerage Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Inc., said by phone.
“PetroChina really was hurt by refining losses.”  Refining losses reached 6.1 billion yuan in the first three
months after the government raised fuel prices by less than 6
percent while New York crude averaged 20 percent higher from a
year earlier. That was offset by increased production of oil and
natural gas, which is set to rise after PetroChina made its
biggest overseas acquisition.  The shares fell 3.1 percent to HK$11.24 in  Hong Kong 
trading today, while the  Hang Seng Index  dropped 0.4 percent.
The stock is up 25 percent in the past year, compared with the
14 percent gain in the benchmark. PetroChina’s Shanghai-listed
shares were unchanged at 11.68 yuan.  Cnooc Shares  Shares in rival  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , which doesn’t have refining
operations, declined 2 percent to HK$19.20 in Hong Kong. The
company said yesterday first-quarter revenue rose 59 percent to
48.5 billion yuan. It didn’t report profit.  Net income at PetroChina may climb 20 percent to 166.9
billion yuan in 2011, according to a mean estimate of 17
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The government is allowed to adjust oil-product prices when
crude costs change more than 4 percent over 22 working days.
 China  last raised gasoline and diesel prices by as much as 5.8
percent on April 7, its second increase this year, after crude
hit a 30-month high.  Exploration and production accounted for 78 percent of
PetroChina’s 2010 operating income and refining and marketing
had a 12 percent share.  Chinese Demand  First-quarter crude output rose 4.3 percent from a year
earlier to 219 million barrels and natural gas production
climbed 7.1 percent to 639.3 billion cubic feet, PetroChina said
in its earnings statement.  Oil refining gained 16 percent to 250.1 million barrels in
the first quarter. PetroChina is planning to increase fuel
output to meet demand from farmers and help supply the world’s
biggest car market.  China’s economy  expanded 9.7 percent in the first three
months, beating a median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists for growth of 9.4 percent. The country’s fuel demand
may rise 8 percent this year, the National Energy Administration
said on April 22.  PetroChina has spent $9.2 billion since the start of last
year on assets. In February, the company bought a C$5.4 billion
($5.7 billion) share of Encana Corp.’s gas assets in British
Columbia and Alberta in its largest overseas acquisition.  The Chinese energy producer wants half its oil and gas
output to come from overseas by 2020, Chairman Jiang Jiemin said
in an interview last year. Less than a 10th of production now
comes from abroad.  PetroChina was overtaken by Apple Inc. as the world’s most
valuable company after Exxon Mobil Corp. last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
