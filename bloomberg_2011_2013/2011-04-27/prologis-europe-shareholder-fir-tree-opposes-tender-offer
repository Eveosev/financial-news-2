Fir Tree Partners, a New York-based
investment firm that owns 4.3 percent of  ProLogis (PLD)  European
Properties, said it opposes a 1.2 billion-euro ($1.78 billion)
tender offer by its largest shareholder.  The bid by ProLogis “significantly” undervalues ProLogis
European, Fir Tree said today in a letter to ProLogis, which
owns about 38 percent of the Luxembourg-based closed-end real
estate fund.  ProLogis, a real estate investment trust based in Denver,
on April 22 offered 6.10 euros per unit for the rest of ProLogis
European. The offer beat a bid by APG Algemene Pensioen Groep NV
and  Goodman Group. (GMG)  ProLogis European closed today at 6.14 euros,
up 2 cents, in Amsterdam.  Fir Tree said ProLogis European’s net asset value is 6.32
euros and its “true value” is even higher because commercial
rents are rising as the global economy improves.  “This is just a standard hedge-fund tactic to drive up the
unit price,” Walter Rakowich, chief executive officer of
ProLogis, said in a telephone interview. “This is a tender
offer, it is not a takeover. Unitholders can choose to tender or
not.”  ProLogis was required to make a tender offer because its
ownership of ProLogis European surpassed the 33.3 percent
threshold, Rakowich said. The offer was 22 percent higher than
the closing price of ProLogis European in Amsterdam on April 12,
before the company said it planned to make an offer.  Dividend Impact  “We anticipate that going forward PEPR will realize
outsized rental growth compared to the market” because it has
shorter leases, Fir Tree said. “A fair offer should compensate
unitholders.”  Fir Tree also said ProLogis European’s recent trading price
was “artificially held down” by its decision to suspend
dividends.  ProLogis plans to update investors this week on the tender
offer acceptances, Rakowich said. He declined to say whether
ProLogis would consider raising its offer, which expires May 6.  “I don’t think that is an appropriate question,” he said.  ProLogis is combining with  AMB Property Corp. (AMB)  to form the
world’s biggest industrial REIT. The merger is scheduled to be
completed in the second quarter.  Fir Tree Partners was formed in 1994 and manages more than
$6.5 billion in assets, according to the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
