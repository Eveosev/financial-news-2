India’s government called a meeting
next week to find out why gas output from the  Reliance
Industries Ltd (RIL) .-operated KG-D6 block has fallen, the Press Trust
of India reported, citing Oil Secretary S. Sundareshan.  Officials from the oil ministry, regulator  Directorate
General of Hydrocarbons  and Reliance will attend, the news
agency said. The government will take measures after the reasons
for the decline are known, according to the report.  The production sharing contract signed by Reliance and the
federal government doesn’t provide for a penalty on the explorer
for failing to meet its drilling plan in the KG-D6 block, Press
Trust reported, citing unidentified people.  Sundareshan couldn’t be reached when called on his office
telephone two times for comment. Reliance spokesman  Manoj
Warrier  declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
