U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened against West Texas Intermediate after  Marathon Oil
Corp. (MRO)  restored operations at its Texas City, Texas, refinery
following a  power failure  early yesterday.  The 81,500-barrel-a-day refinery is operating normally
today, Shane Pochard, a company spokesman for Marathon, said in
an e-mail.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  is proceeding cautiously in the restart
of its 245,000-barrel-a-day Texas City plant, said  Bill Day , a
company spokesman. The plant shut after a power failure early
yesterday.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI strengthened 80
cents to $14.30 a barrel at 2:26 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet widened 85
cents to $14.80 a barrel over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend gained 55 cents to $6.65 a barrel. Poseidon strengthened
55 cents to $6.95 a barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse’s premium widened 65 cents to $10.35 a
barrel. Southern Green Canyon’s premium gained 25 cents to $5.50
a barrel.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to $3.15 a
barrel. The grade has tracked more closely to its historical
average discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland,
Texas, away from the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing, Oklahoma,
the delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude gained 80 cents to $10.55 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in Alberta. The discount for Western Canada
Select was unchanged at $15.60 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
