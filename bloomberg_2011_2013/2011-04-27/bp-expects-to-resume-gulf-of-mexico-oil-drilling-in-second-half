BP Plc (BP/)  expects to resume drilling
in the  Gulf of Mexico  in the second half, more than a year after
the Macondo well blowout that caused the worst U.S. spill, Chief
Financial Officer Byron Grote said.  BP has applied for permits with the U.S. authorities, Grote
told analysts today on a conference call. Production from the
Gulf of Mexico in the first quarter was down by about 100,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day from a year earlier, a loss that
was partly offset by higher  oil prices , he said.  The return to Gulf drilling will bolster BP after a drop in
output led to lower profit in the first three months of the
year. While Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron
Corp. restarted some operations last month, BP has yet to
receive permission to resume since President  Barack Obama  lifted
the moratorium on deepwater drilling in the region that provides
BP with some of its highest margins.  BP spent about $100 million in the first quarter in rig
standby costs in the Gulf of Mexico, Grote said. Global oil and
gas production slipped 11 percent in the period on the Gulf
drilling ban and the sale of $24 billion in assets worldwide,
the company said.  BP took an additional $400 million charge for spill costs,
bringing the total provisions to more than $41 billion.
Excluding one-time items and inventory changes, earnings fell to
$5.37 billion from $5.6 billion a year earlier. BP was expected
to earn $5.6 billion on this basis, according to the mean
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
