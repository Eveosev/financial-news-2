British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) 
reached a new agreement to broadcast most of the UEFA Champions
League soccer matches until summer 2015, while  ITV Plc (ITV)  said it
retained the rights to show a portion of the games.  BSkyB, the U.K.’s largest pay-TV provider, will show 129
live Champions League matches through its Sky Sports channels,
the broadcaster said on its website today. The company will show
all live televised matches on Wednesdays, all except the first-
choice game on Tuesdays and one game from each semi-final as
well as the final.  BSkyB, based in Isleworth, England, is seeking to win more
exclusive content to retain customers to its pay-television
service. The broadcaster, which has 10 million subscribers,
signed a deal last year with Time Warner Inc. to show all new
HBO television programs in the U.K.  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp.
owns 39 percent of the broadcaster and has offered to buy the
rest.  “The UEFA Champions League goes from strength to strength
and we look forward to extending our relationship with UEFA,”
Barney Francis, managing director of Sky Sports, said in a
statement.  ITV, the U.K.’s biggest commercial broadcaster, said it
will show 18 live games, the same number as under the previous
deal, including shared live coverage of the final and Super Cup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
