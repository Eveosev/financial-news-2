Canadian stocks rose as companies
including Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Caterpillar Inc. and
Canadian  Oil Sands  Ltd. beat analysts’ earnings estimates and
metals producers gained on a weaker  U.S. dollar .  Canadian Oil Sands, the largest owner of the Syncrude
project, advanced 1.9 percent. BlackBerry maker  Research In
Motion Ltd. (RIM)  plunged 13 percent after at least five analysts
reduced their ratings on the shares.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the
world’s largest gold producer, increased 0.6 percent as the U.S.
dollar slipped for a ninth day.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index climbed 21.26
points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,915.66 at 9:46 a.m. in Toronto.
Among S&P/TSX stocks, 148 rose, 84 declined and 16 were
unchanged.  The index has lost 1.4 percent this month, or 1.2 percent
with dividends included, for the first negative total return
since June. The streak of positive returns was the longest since
1983. Energy and financial companies have led the decline as
data and forecasts indicated a slowing recovery in the U.S.,
which bought 75 percent of Canadian exports last year, according
to  Statistics Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story;
