Gasoline rose to a 33-month high
after the Energy Department reported that supplies fell to the
lowest level since August 2009 and as Texas refinery shutdowns
threatened to further deplete inventories.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped a tenth consecutive week,
losing 2.51 million barrels to 205.6 million, and have shed 35.5
million barrels since Feb. 11, when they were the highest in
almost 21 years. Power outages in  Texas City  disrupted
production at three plants able to process about 800,000 barrels
a day of crude.  “The power is back on, but it gave the market a huge scare
and will probably mess up inventories next week,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “We
lost precious time in building up our summer inventories.”  Gasoline for May delivery rose 4.73 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $3.4045 a gallon at 12:16 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures touched $3.4171, the highest intraday price
for the front-month contract since July 15, 2008.  Supplies of gasoline in Padd 1, which includes New York
Harbor, the delivery point of the Nymex contract, sank 3.2
percent to the lowest level since Oct. 31, 2008, according to
department data.  Gasoline demand, measured by deliveries to wholesalers,
rose 1 percent to an average 9.15 million barrels a day. On a
four-week average, fuel consumption was 1.6 percent below a year
earlier.  Tight Supplies  “Supply markets are tightening and this is bound to
increase nervousness in the market, so it’s bullish for gasoline
prices,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security
Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “But even though
supply is low, so is demand. The market is still being supported
by tight production.”  Refiners increased rates 0.2 percentage point to 82.7
percent, 6.3 percentage points below a year earlier. Production
of gasoline dropped to 8.84 million barrels a day, compared with
9.21 million last year.  BP Plc and Valero Energy Corp. each said their Texas City
refineries are restarting units after the  power outage . Marathon
Oil Corp. said its refinery is operating normally.  Regular retail gasoline rose 1 cent to $3.879 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest price
since Aug. 3, 2008.  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
fell 1.81 million barrels to 146.5 million, the lowest level in
a year. Demand dropped to 3.74 million barrels a day, and on a
four-week average was 7.3 percent above a year earlier,
according to the department.  Heating oil for May delivery added 3.34 cents, or 1
percent, to $324.45 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
