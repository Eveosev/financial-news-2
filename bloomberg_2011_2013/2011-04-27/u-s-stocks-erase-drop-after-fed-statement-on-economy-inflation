U.S. stocks erased losses as the
 Federal Reserve  said the economy is recovering at a “moderate
pace” and a pickup in inflation is likely to be temporary,
while confirming plans to complete bond purchases in June.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed less than 0.1
percent to 1,348.06 at 12:38 p.m. in  New York  after falling as
much as 0.2 percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
rose 36.48 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,631.85.  The S&P 500 fell earlier as declines in commodity producers
overshadowed higher-than-estimated earnings at companies
including Corning Inc. and Whirlpool Corp.  The S&P 500 rallied 29 percent through yesterday after Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  suggested on Aug. 27 that he would
pursue a second round of asset purchases to stimulate the
economy, a tactic known as quantitative easing. Stocks have also
rallied amid higher-than-estimated profits. Earnings per share
beat estimates at 77 percent of the 197 companies in the  S&P 500 
that have reported quarterly results since April 11, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The economic recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace
and overall conditions in the labor market are improving
gradually,” the  Federal Open Market Committee  said today in its
statement after a two-day meeting in  Washington . “Increases in
the prices of energy and other commodities have pushed up
inflation in recent months,” and the Fed expects “these
effects to be transitory,” the statement said.  Chairman Bernanke will gives his first press conference
after a meeting of policy makers later today.  Durable Goods  A report before the open of exchanges showed that orders
for durable goods rose in March for a third consecutive month,
showing businesses intend to keep spending to update equipment.
Bookings for equipment meant to last at least three years
climbed 2.5 percent after a 0.7 percent gain the prior month
that was revised from a previously reported drop, the Commerce
Department said.       Financial stocks are poised to rally after lagging behind
the S&P 500 because the two groups are echoing a pattern set
last year, Oppenheimer & Co.’s Carter Worth said.  The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, an exchange-traded
fund tracking 82 S&P 500 companies in the industry, has lost 2
percent in the past year through yesterday while the SPDR S&P
500 ETF Trust, an ETF linked to the entire index, jumped 11
percent. The ratio of their prices fell to 0.121 in November
from 0.141 in April 2010, meaning the financial ETF trailed the
S&P 500, before rebounding to 0.129 in January. It has since
fallen to 0.12.  “Our hunch is that the disconnect is resolved this time
just as it was resolved late last autumn, with the financials
coming to life and playing catch-up with the market,”  New York- 
based Worth wrote in a note sent to clients yesterday.
