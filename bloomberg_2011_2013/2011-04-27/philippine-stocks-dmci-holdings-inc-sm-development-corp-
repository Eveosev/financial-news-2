Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in

4,321.32.  DMCI Holdings Inc. (DMC)  , the nation’s biggest
construction company, lost 2.3 percent to 45.90 pesos, the
sharpest decline since Jan. 19. The stock was lowered to
“hold” from “buy” by Paul Jeffrey Lu, an analyst at
CitisecOnline.com Inc. Lu cited valuations as DMCI shares have
gained 23 percent in the past month, pushing its price-to-
earnings multiple to 15.5 times.  “DMCI’s fundamentals are strong but the recent gains in
the share price have made it expensive relative to its existing
business,” Lu said in a phone interview. The 12-month share
price estimate was raised to 45 pesos from 37.80 pesos, he said.  SM Development Corp. (SMDC)  , a developer owned by
Philippine billionaire  Henry Sy , advanced 3.1 percent to 9.36
pesos, the highest since Nov. 9. The company said first-quarter
consolidated net income rose 45 percent to 916.3 million pesos
