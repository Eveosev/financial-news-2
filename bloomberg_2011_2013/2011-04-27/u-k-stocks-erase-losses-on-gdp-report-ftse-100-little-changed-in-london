U.K. stocks erased losses as a
report showed the economy rebounded in the first quarter and
shares of  Aggreko Plc (AGK)  and International Consolidated Airlines
Group climbed.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index rose 0.1 percent to 6,073.25
at 11:18 a.m. in  London , paring earlier losses of much as 0.4
percent.  The Office for National Statistics said today in London
that gross domestic product rose 0.5 percent from the final
quarter of 2010, when it fell by the same amount. The result
matched the median economist forecast.  Aggreko jumped 4.9 percent to 1,794 pence after the world’s
largest provider of mobile power supplies said trading profit in
2011 will be “slightly” ahead of 2010.  IAG, the owner of British Airways, climbed 3.1 percent to
236.8 pence, extending yesterday’s 4.5 percent advance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
