Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures rose for the first time in three days after a
U.S. Energy Department report showed that gasoline stockpiles
tumbled to the lowest level since August 2009.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.8 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 27.1 percent yesterday.  Oil for June delivery gained 55 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
settle at $112.76 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Futures have risen 37 percent in the past year.  Oil prices  fell
a combined 8 cents the previous two days.  The most active contracts in electronic trading were June
$115 calls with 1,911 lots changing hands. They rose 27 cents to
$2.07 a barrel. June $125 calls, the next most active option,
gained 1 cent to 30 cents a barrel with 1,750 contracts trading.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  July $125 calls were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 5,799 lots changing hands. They fell 5
cents to $1.21 a barrel. The next most active option, June $125
calls, lost 6 cents to 29 cents a barrel on 5,377 lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
44,639 contracts. Next were June 2011 $150 calls with 44,082 and
