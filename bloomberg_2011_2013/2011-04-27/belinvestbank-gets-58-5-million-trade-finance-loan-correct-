(Corrects amount in first paragraph.)  The Belarusian Bank of Development
and Reconstruction, known as Belinvestbank, got a $58.5 million

more than the  London  interbank offered rate on the facility,
according to the statement. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Belinvestbank is 93.3 percent state-owned. It has a rating
of B from Fitch Ratings and B3 from Moody’s Investors Service,
