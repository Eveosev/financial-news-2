Gold futures rose to a record
$1,530.30 an ounce on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will
be slow to raise U.S. borrowing costs, weakening the dollar and
boosting the appeal of the metal as an alternative asset.  The dollar fell to the lowest since December 2009 against
the euro after the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
said it would continue $600 billion in bond purchases through
June. The  European Central Bank  this month began raising rates
to stem inflation.  “This move is about the dollar,” said  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in  Chicago . “There’s no hint
whatsoever of the Fed being close to raising rates, so people
are buying gold.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $13.60, or 0.9 percent,
to settle at $1,517.10 at 1:48 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
After the close, the metal reached the all-time high. The price
has gained 31 percent in the past year.  Gold for immediate delivery rose as much as 1.6 percent to
a record $1,529.68. The price traded at $1,528.88 at 3:42 p.m.  The Fed has kept its benchmark rate at zero percent to 0.25
percent since December 2008 to stimulate the economy. Today, the
central bank raised its estimate for  core inflation  and reduced
its growth outlook for 2011.  Earlier this month, the European Central Bank raised its
main lending rate by a quarter point to 1.25 percent and
signaled it will continue with increases to stem inflation.  Dollar ‘Suffering’  “There’s not a lot the Fed can do to ease the dollar’s
suffering,” said  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in Chicago. “The U.S. will be behind in the
tightening cycle, and that’s a green light to buy gold.”  There will likely be no tightening of policy “for a couple
of meetings,” Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a press
conference after the rate-setting meeting.  “The Fed has just given the go-ahead to buy more gold,”
FuturePath’s Lesh said.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 90.8 cents, or 2
percent, to settle at $45.987 an ounce on the Comex. In after-
hours trading, the price rose as much as 7.1 percent. Two days
ago, the metal, which has doubled in the past 12 months, reached
a 31-year high of $49.845.  Palladium futures for June delivery climbed $2.40, or 0.3
percent, to $758.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price has advanced 38 percent in the past 12
months.  Platinum futures for July delivery gained $13.80, or 0.8
percent, to $1,819.20 an ounce. The metal has gained 5.7 percent
in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
