Euro-region banks are starting to
pass on higher interest rates of the  European Central Bank  to
retail depositors,  Handelsblatt  reported.  ING-DiBa AG, which has 7 million clients and is  Germany ’s
largest online bank, announced that it will raise its overnight
deposit rate to 1.5 percent from 1.3 percent in mid-May, the
Dusseldorf-based newspaper said. Most banks will probably pass
on this month’s increase in the ECB’s main refinancing rate in
the next six to 12 weeks, Philipp Haessler, an analyst at
Equinet AG, was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
