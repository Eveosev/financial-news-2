The ACT Brumbies hired Rugby World
Cup-winning coach Jake White on a four-year contract to replace
Tony Rea at the end of the Super Rugby season.  White, who guided  South Africa  to its second world title in
2007, will take over at the Canberra-based franchise from mid
July, the Brumbies said today in a statement.  “It’s a massive coup,” Brumbies Chief Executive Officer
Andrew Fagan said in a news conference. “Jake is one of the
best coaches in world rugby so to have him come to Canberra is a
tremendous bonus for us. His enthusiasm set him apart as well as
his record.”  The Brumbies, who’ve twice won southern hemisphere rugby’s
top provincial competition, haven’t reached the playoffs since
2004 and are in third place in the five-team Australian
Conference, with two wins from eight matches.  White, 47, coached South Africa’s under-21 team to junior
World Cup victory in 2002 before taking over the Springboks two
years later. He’s the only coach to have led teams to both the
junior and senior World Cup titles. Under White, South Africa
also won the Tri-Nations in 2004.  Rea, who was appointed as the Brumbies’ caretaker head
coach after Andy Friend was fired two games into the season, was
an unsuccessful applicant to take the position permanently, the
Brumbies said.  “I can’t say enough about Tony Rea and the way he has
managed his role,” Fagan said in a statement. “He has shown
tremendous integrity and character in difficult circumstances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
