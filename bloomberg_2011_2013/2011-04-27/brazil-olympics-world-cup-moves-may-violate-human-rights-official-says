Brazil ’s government may be
violating human rights as cities including Sao Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro evict families to prepare for the 2014  World Cup  and
2016  Olympic Games , according Raquel Rolnik, special rapporteur
on adequate housing for the United Nations Human Rights Council.  “I am particularly worried about what seems to be a
pattern that’s lacking transparency, consultation, dialogue,
fair negotiation, and participation of the affected communities
in processes concerning evictions undertaken or planned in
connection with the World Cup and Olympics,” Rolnick said,
according to a  report  on the U.N. agency’s website. “I am also
concerned about the very limited compensation offered to the
communities affected.”  Numerous evictions have already been carried out without
residents being given enough time to propose alternatives and
without adequate relocation plans, the report said.  Federal, state, and municipal authorities “should put a
stop to planned evictions until dialogue and negotiation can be
ensured,” said Rolnick, a professor of urbanism and
architecture at the University of  Sao Paulo  who was named to the
rights council post in May 2008.  Officials at the president’s office and Sports Ministry
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
