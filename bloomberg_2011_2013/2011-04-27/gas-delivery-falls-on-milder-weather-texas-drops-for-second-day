Natural gas shipments scheduled for
delivery to U.S. power plants dropped for the first time in
three days as milder weather reduced cooling demand. Shipments
to  Texas  fell to a one-week low.  Scheduled delivery for power generation declined 1.8
percent to 15 million dekatherms (14.5 billion cubic feet),
according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 3:30 p.m. in New
York.  Gas shipments set for electricity generators in Texas fell
for a second day, down 3.4 percent to 2.43 million dekatherms,
the lowest level since April 18.  Dallas was expected to have a high of 72 degrees Fahrenheit
(22 Celsius) today, 7 degrees below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. The city had a
high of 87 degrees on April 24, 9 degrees above normal.  Wholesale natural gas at Katy, Texas, rose 0.5 percent to
$4.3227 per million British thermal units on the
Intercontinental Exchange. The hub is 27 miles (43 kilometers)
west of Houston.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
increased 0.6 percent to $4.3496 per million Btu.  Natural gas is used to generate 48 percent of power in
