Merck & Co., the second-largest
U.S. drugmaker, increased a share repurchase program by $5
billion, raising the total amount of stock that can be bought
back to $6.4 billion.  Merck, based in Whitehouse Station,  New Jersey , announced
the new buyback program in a statement today. The drugmaker drew
$10.8 billion in cash from operating activities last year,
according to a regulatory filing. The company, which pays a
quarterly dividend of 38 cents a share, earlier this month
agreed to split sales for the arthritis drug Remicade with
 Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , ending a dispute that helped drive Merck’s
stock down over the last year.  “We do find it encouraging,”  Les Funtleyder , a fund
manager and health strategist with Miller Tabak & Co. in  New
York , which holds Merck shares, said of the repurchase program
in an e-mail today. “Now that Merck has resolved its case with
J&J, it probably feels it has the visibility to deploy its
capital.”  Merck rose 57 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $35.63 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are down
1.1 percent this year.  Also today, Merck won a U.S. panel’s backing to sell its
experimental hepatitis C drug. The medicine, boceprevir, is
effective and safe enough to support approval, outside advisers
to the  Food and Drug Administration  said today in an 18-0 vote
in Silver Spring, Maryland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
