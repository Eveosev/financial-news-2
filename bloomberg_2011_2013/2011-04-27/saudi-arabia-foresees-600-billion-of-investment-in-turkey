Saudi Arabia foresees investment of
$600 billion in  Turkey  during the next 20 years, according to
Abdul Kareem Abu al Nasr, the chairman of  National Commercial
Bank , the biggest Saudi lender.  Investment in Turkey’s agriculture and manufacturing is set
to increase, Abu al Nasr says today in a presentation to be
delivered in Turkey, a copy of which has been obtained by
Bloomberg News.  “In the agriculture space, Turkey emerged as one of the
top recipients of Saudi investment, as the kingdom seeks to
boost its food security,” he says.  Planet Food World Co. will invest $3 billion in Turkish
agriculture in the next five years, with the aim of exporting
food products to the Gulf region, he adds.  The strength of Turkey’s agriculture enabled exports of
farm products to  Saudi Arabia  to increase from $90 million in
2008 to $144 million in 2009, according to Abu al Nasr.  To contact the reporter on this story:
