A lack of viable projects and
reduced domestic borrowing by the government has resulted in
excess liquidity in the Mauritian banking system, Mauritius
Bankers’ Association Chairman Ravin Dajee said.  The central government is raising funds from the foreign
market at more favorable rates, which has resulted in fewer
Treasury bills being sold, Dajee, who is also the managing
director of Barclays Plc’s Mauritian unit, said in an interview
with Business Magazine, a Port Louis-based weekly publication.  To contact the reporter on this story: Kamlesh Bhuckory in Port
