Serbia â€™s  JAT Airways  said it
will offer flights to Dubrovnik in Croatia in June, two decades
after the violent breakup of the former Yugoslavia disrupted
the route.  With the revival of political and economic ties between
Croatia and Serbia, an increasing number of Serbian tourists
vacation on the Croatian coast, JAT said today in an e-mailed
statement. The airline will initially fly to Dubrovnik twice
a week, it said.  The Belgrade-based carrier, which the state plans to
restructure and sell, is also launching seasonal flights to
Gerona,  Spain , adding to its 32 current destinations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
