The Hong Kong stock exchange’s
listing committee rejected plans by  PCCW Ltd. (8)  to spin off its
telecommunications business, according to a statement from the
company to the bourse.  The reasons given for the decision are not justified and
the company will appeal, PCCW, Hong Kong’s biggest phone
operator, said in the statement. The exchange doesn’t comment on
individual companies or cases, Scott Sapp, a spokesman, said by
phone.  The planned spinoff of PCCW assets into a separately listed
trust, which follows at least six attempts to reorganize the
phone company since 2006, would have generated funds for
Chairman  Richard Li  to invest in faster-growing businesses. The
company’s fixed-line sales fell 9.8 percent to HK$1.68 billion
in the second half of last year, it said.  PCCW slid 0.9 percent to HK$3.18 as of 9:39 a.m. in  Hong
Kong  trading. The stock has lost 7.6 percent this year, compared
with a 5.1 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Telecommunications businesses, including fixed-line,
Internet, mobile-phone, pay-television and computing services,
accounted for more than 90 percent of PCCW’s second-half revenue
of HK$11.2 billion, with the rest coming from property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
