H. Lundbeck A/S no longer faces the
risk that German health insurance funds will stop reimbursement
of its Alzheimer’s treatment Ebixa after the country’s health-
assessment agency reversed its opinion and said the drug works.  Germany ’s Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health
Care had issued a preliminary finding in September 2009 that no
proof existed indicating medicines containing the drug’s active
ingredient, memantine, benefited patients with moderate or
severe Alzheimer’s. A conclusive finding would likely have led
to a halt in reimbursement.  “We, of course, objected to that conclusion,” Mads Kronborg, a spokesman for Valby, Denmark-based Lundbeck, said
today by phone. “Now they have reached the opposite conclusion,
which is good news for patients.”  The agency reversed its opinion in a report published
yesterday, after getting additional data, Klaus Koch, deputy
head of communications said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
