The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission will seek comment on definitions for security-based
swaps that aim to clarify the agency’s authority over trading of
derivatives.  The commissioners voted 5-0 today to propose a series of
definitions that would shape the trading and regulation of
derivatives including certain credit-default swaps.  The SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are
required by the Dodd-Frank Act to establish parallel regulatory
systems for derivatives markets, with the SEC overseeing
security-based swaps and the CFTC regulating all others. The
definitions exclude already regulated insurance products and
consumer transactions such as home heating oil contracts,
according to a CFTC summary.  Today’s vote by SEC commissioners opens the agency’s
proposal to public comment for 60 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
