Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri
AS,  Turkey ’s biggest mobile-phone company, said profit in
the first quarter dropped 21 percent after competition
increased and the industry regulator cut termination rates.
Shares fell.  Net income slid to 330.1 million liras ($218 million)
from 417.6 million liras a year earlier, the Istanbul-based
company said in a PRNewswire statement today. Turkcell was
expected to earn 362 million liras, according to the
average estimate of nine analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Turkcell, partly owned by Sweden’s  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , is
facing stiffer competition in its home market from  Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD)  and Avea Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, majority owned
by  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS. (TTKOM)   Sales and marketing costs have increased as Turkcell
sought to protect its market share, said Ilke Homris, an
analyst at broker Is Yatirim in Istanbul. The reduction in
termination rates, introduced on April 1 last year, also
hurt margins, she said.  Turkcell fell 6 kurus, or 0.7 percent, to 8.88 liras
on the main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  at 10:12 a.m. in
Istanbul, extending this week’s losses to 3.3 percent.  Turkcell also revised down its estimates for revenue
and spending this year.  “Lackluster results and downward revision to guidance
is due to proliferating competition in the Turkish mobile
space,” Istanbul-based broker Standard Unlu said in an e-
mailed report. “Poor margins were a function of both
continued high selling and marketing expenses and
aggressive tariff campaigns.”  Turkcell said it expected lower growth this year and
revised its 2011 target for consolidated revenue to between
9.3 billion liras and 9.6 billion liras and earnings before
tax, interest, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to
between 2.9 billion liras and 3.05 billion liras.  “We now expect to spend less compared to 2010, at the
figure of around 1.5 billion liras,” Turkcell said.  Profit was also hurt by a provision of 55.8 million
liras ($36.8 million) regarding a tax-amnesty application.  To contact the reporter on this story:
