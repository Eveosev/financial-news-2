The French Foreign Ministry said it
summoned  Syria ’s ambassador to protest her country’s
increasingly violent suppression of anti-government protests.  Foreign Ministry Chief of Staff Herve Ladsous told Lamia
Chakkour of  France ’s “firm condemnation of the rising
repression against the population by Syrian authorities,” the
ministry said in a statement. “We recalled to Mrs. Chakkour
that the Syrian authorities must respond to their people’s
legitimate aspirations by reforms, not force.”  The summoning of the ambassador was coordinated with
Britain,  Germany , Spain and Italy, the statement said.  The foreign ministry didn’t respond to an e-mailed question
about what sanctions France could favor against the Syrian
regime.  The UN Security Council yesterday failed to agree on a
European proposal to condemn the Syrian attacks. The debate is
due to resume today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
