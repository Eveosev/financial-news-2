China ’s stocks rose for the first
time in four days as earnings for banks and industrial companies
jumped and an increase in U.S. consumer confidence bolstered the
outlook for the global economic recovery.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. led gains for
lenders before the biggest banks report earnings this week and
as Shenzhen Development Bank Co. said profit surged 52 percent.
A gauge of consumer staples producers climbed the most among
industry groups after Citigroup Inc. recommended the stocks.
Poly Real Estate Group Co., the second-largest developer, fell
1.1 percent as the China Securities Journal said the government
may raise down payment requirements for first-home purchases.  “There isn’t a risk of a further big decline in the market
because the U.S. data suggests external demand is still there
and banks’ earnings exceeded estimates,” said  Zhang Qi , an
analyst at Haitong Securities Co. in Shanghai.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, advanced 10.45 points, or 0.4 percent,
to 2,949.47 as of 10:33 a.m. local time. The CSI 300 Index added
0.3 percent to 3,239.99.  The Shanghai Composite has slid 3.6 percent from a five-
month high on April 18 amid concern the government will add to
10 increases in lenders’ reserve requirements and four interest-
rate increases since the start of 2010 as inflation quickened to
the fastest pace since 2008 in March. The stocks gauge has
climbed 5 percent this year.  ICBC gained 0.9 percent to 4.54 yuan.  China Construction
Bank Corp. (939) , the second-largest, advanced 1 percent to 5.17 yuan.
Shenzhen Bank rose 1.2 percent to 18.64 yuan after first-quarter
net income jumped 52 percent to 2.4 billion yuan. Bank of Ningbo,
part-owned by Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., added 0.2 percent
to 13.68 yuan after net income for 2010 climbed 59 percent.  ‘Buying Opportunity’  Chinese banks that are also traded in  Hong Kong  may report
profit growth of 32 percent on average in the first quarter,
spurred by higher net interest margins, Barclays Plc said this
week.  Recent stock declines are a “buying opportunity” for
investors, according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. The
bottom for the Shanghai Composite may be 2,700 points based on
worst-case earnings projections, Ling Peng and Chen Jie,
analysts at the Shanghai-based brokerage, wrote in a report.
Shenyin & Wanguo recommends buying financial stocks and shares
of companies related to fixed-asset investment, the report said.  Chinese industrial companies’ profits climbed 32 percent in
the first quarter, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said on its
website today. That compared with a 34 percent gain in the first
two months of this year.  A gauge tracking consumer staples in the  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
jumped 1 percent, the most among the measure’s 10 industry
groups. Wuliangye Yibin Co., China’s second-biggest maker of
white liquor by market value, rose 3.5 percent to 32.78 yuan.  Farmers Incomes  Several trends are emerging including rising income growth
among farmers, Citigroup said in a report. “Farmers tend to
spend more on transportation, communications and health-care as
they get richer,” Citigroup said. The bank also recommended
banks and health-care as well as utilities.  China’s tightening policies are approaching an end and the
global economic environment has improved, bolstering the outlook
for Chinese stocks, Citigroup analysts led by Minggao Shen said.  In the U.S., the Conference Board’s confidence index rose
to 65.4 in April from a revised 63.8 reading in March, figures
from the New York-based private research group showed yesterday.
The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected an advance to 64.5.  Smallcaps Outlook  Federal Reserve policy makers began two days of meetings
yesterday, and will likely say they’ll complete a second round
of scheduled bond purchases worth $600 billion through the end
of June to help sustain the recovery. The U.S. is China’s
second-largest export market, accounting for about 20 percent of
its overseas shipments.  Chinese small-company stocks will extend the steepest two-
day drop in three months as more companies miss profit estimates
amid government tightening, said GF Fund Management Co., China’s
sixth-biggest asset manager.  The  CSI Smallcap 500 Index (SH000905)  slumped 1.7 percent to 4,970.57
yesterday, capping a two-day, 3.8 percent retreat that’s the
most since Jan. 18. The ChiNext index of start-up companies
dropped to the lowest since October.  Earnings per-share at the 320 companies that have released
first-quarter earnings in the 500-member small-cap index trailed
analysts’ estimates by 14 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Expectations ‘Too High’  “Earnings expectations for small caps were too high and
many of them failed to meet expectations,” said Chen Shide, a
Guangzhou-based manager of small-cap stocks at GF Fund, which
oversees about $15.9 billion. “Small caps definitely haven’t
reached a bottom yet. Investors are now beginning to pay for
ramping up share prices over the past two years.”  Companies traded on the small-cap gauge are valued at 28.3
times estimated earnings, more than twice the CSI 300’s multiple
of 14.6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Poly Real Estate lost 1.1 percent to 13.40 yuan. China
Vanke Co., the biggest listed developer, slid 0.7 percent to
8.49 yuan. Gemdale Corp. retreated 1.1 percent to 6.49 yuan.  The Chinese government may require down payments of 50
percent for first-home purchases if property prices continue to
rise, the China Securities Journal reported today, citing an
unidentified loan official at a domestic bank. The land ministry
will also issue policies to control the price of land, it said.
The banking regulator may also tighten regulation of loans trust
companies extend to developers, according to the report.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
