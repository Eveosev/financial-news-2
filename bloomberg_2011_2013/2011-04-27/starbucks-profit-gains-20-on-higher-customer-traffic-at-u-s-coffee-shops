Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s
largest coffee-shop operator, posted a 20 percent increase in
second-quarter profit, meeting analysts’ projections, as more
customers visited U.S. stores.  Net income in the period ended April 3 increased to $261.6
million, or 34 cents a share, the Seattle-based company said
today. Starbucks also said rising commodity costs will cut full-
year profit by 22 cents, compared with a previous estimate of 20
cents, because of higher fuel and dairy prices.  “Gas prices are up of course, up dramatically, and that
impacts our business in a number of places,” Chief Financial
Officer Troy Alstead said in a telephone interview. “The
underlying strength of our core business helps us offset those
pressures, but the pressures are there.”  Starbucks and other restaurant operators also have coped
with surging expenses for coffee, sugar and cocoa over the past
year, leading to price increases in certain markets. Coffee
futures prices have more than doubled over the past 12 months.  Starbucks fell 1.7 percent to $36.55 in late trading after
closing at $37.19 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have
gained 16 percent this year.  Starbucks raised its full-year earnings forecast today to
as much as $1.48 a share, compared with a previous top range of
$1.47. Analysts on average project $1.49.  Overseas Growth  The coffee brewer, which generated more than 70 percent of
sales in the U.S. last year, has looked to  developing countries 
such as  China  to spur growth. Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  plans to more than triple Starbucks’s store count in
mainland China to 1,500 by 2015.  Second-quarter revenue advanced 9.9 percent to $2.79
billion. In the year-earlier period, profit was $217.3 million,
or 28 cents a share.  Sales at stores open at least 13 months in the U.S. climbed
7 percent in the quarter, while international same-store sales
rose 4 percent. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg anticipated
increases of 5.5 percent in the U.S. and 4.2 percent abroad.  “We were a bit soft in  Canada , and Canada is our biggest
international market,” Alstead said. The country was “really
hard hit by weather in the quarter.”  The coffee brewer has about 17,000 cafes in more than 50
countries. Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd. lowered its full-year
profit forecast following the March 11 earthquake that shuttered
more than 10 percent of stores there. Starbucks had about 900
stores in the country as of Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
