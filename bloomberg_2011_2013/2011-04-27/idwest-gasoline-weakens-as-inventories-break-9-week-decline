Gasoline in the Midwest weakened as
inventories in the region gained after declining for nine
consecutive weeks.  Gasoline stockpiles in the Midwest rose 379,000 barrels to
47.5 million barrels last week, according to the Energy
Department. It’s the first increase since February.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest, or Group 3, widened 1.75 cents to 13 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
4:09 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 3.35 cents to $3.2282.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  completed a mechanical turnaround at
its Ardmore, Oklahoma, refinery, and units are restarting,  Bill Day , a Valero spokesman, said in an e-mail April 25.  Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  strengthened as three Houston-
area refineries worked to return after shutting yesterday
because of a  power outage .  Valero Energy Corp. said its Texas City refinery is
restarting units. Marathon Oil Corp. said its plant is operating
normally.  BP Plc delayed the restart of its 475,000-barrel-a-day
Texas City, Texas, refinery after an external power failure
forced its chemical plant to shut down, said a person with
knowledge of the situation.  The discount for gasoline in the Gulf Coast narrowed 1.3
cents to 10 cents a gallon versus futures.  BP’s chemical plant shut early today after a  power failure 
from a third-party provider, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential. BP is
waiting to restart its 475,000-barrel-a-day refinery until it is
comfortable with the grid’s reliability, said the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
