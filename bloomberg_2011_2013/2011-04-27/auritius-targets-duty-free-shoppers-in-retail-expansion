The Mauritian government plans to
develop the Indian Ocean island nation as a center for duty free
shopping, Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth said.  Turnover from the industry could reach 20 billion rupees
($723 million) by 2020 from 7 billion rupees at the moment,
according to estimates from the ministry, which is based in the
capital,  Port Louis .  “Our initial target is to attract around 200,000 shoppers
from emerging markets, including  India , as well as from
traditional markets like  Europe ,” Jugnauth said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Property development and shopping mall projects in the
pipeline will require investment of $2.3 billion, according to
data from the Board of Investment website. The country’s biggest
shopping mall, developed by ENL Property Ltd. of Mauritius, a
subsidiary of ENL group and Atterbury of  South Africa , is
scheduled to open on Sept. 29.  Tourism is the country’s main source of foreign currency,
with revenue expected to rise 7.7 percent to 42.5 billion rupees
in 2011, the Central Statistics Office said on Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
