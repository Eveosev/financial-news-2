Asian stocks rose for the first
time in four days after U.S. consumer confidence increased,
boosting the outlook for the region’s exporters.  Samsung Electronics Co., Asia’s largest maker of chips,
flat screens and mobile phones, gained 3 percent in Seoul.  Canon
Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest manufacturer of cameras, surged 7
percent in  Tokyo .  Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG) ,  Australia ’s No. 1 energy
retailer, increased 3.9 percent in Sydney after it and
ConocoPhillips signed an agreement last week to supply liquefied
natural gas to  China  Petrochemical Corp. Australia resumed
trading today following a five-day Easter break.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.3 percent to 138.39 at
5:25 p.m. in Tokyo, paring an advance of as much as 1.2 percent.
Five stocks gained for every four that dropped. The measure
climbed 2.2 percent last week after U.S. companies including
Apple Inc. reported increased profits, signaling the global
economic recovery is accelerating.  “The  U.S. economy  is recovering and corporate earnings are
strong,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “More and more manufacturers are
resuming operations at factories” after  Japan ’s March 11
earthquake. “That’s positive for stocks.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average increased 1.4 percent as
the trade ministry said 60 percent of factories in earthquake-
stricken areas have restarted production. The nation’s
sovereign-rating outlook was cut to “negative” by  Standard &
Poor’s  as reconstruction costs following last month’s temblor
will likely add to what is already the world’s biggest debt load.  South Korea, Australia  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2 percent.  Hong Kong ’s
Hang Seng Index declined 0.5 percent, erasing its advance of as
much as 1.1 percent, while China’s Shanghai Composite Index lost
0.5 percent, erasing gains of as much as 0.8 percent.  South Korea’s Kospi Index was little changed, trimming
gains of as much as 1.1 percent, as the nation’s economic growth
accelerated in the first quarter, bolstering the case for
another interest-rate increase. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
fell 0.8 percent, erasing gains of as much as 0.3 percent, after
a report showed the country’s consumer prices gained the most in
five years in the first quarter, increasing pressure on the
Reserve Bank of Australia to raise rates.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. In  New York , the index gained 0.9 percent yesterday, the
highest level since June 2008, as earnings at companies from 3M
Co. to United Parcel Service Inc. and Ford Motor Co. topped
analysts’ estimates and confidence among U.S. consumers
increased more than forecast.  Exporters Rise  Exporters gained after a report from the New York-based
Conference Board showed the confidence index rose to 65.4 in
April from a revised 63.8 reading in March. The median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected an advance to 64.5.  Samsung Electronics, which gets about 22 percent of sales
from America, climbed 3 percent to 924,000 won in Seoul.  Li &
Fung Ltd. (494) , the biggest supplier of clothes and toys to retailers
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., gained 1 percent to HK$39.45 in
Hong Kong. Canon, which gets more than 80 percent of its sales
outside of Japan, surged 7 percent to 3,740 yen in Tokyo.  Federal Reserve policy makers began two days of meetings
yesterday, and will likely say they’ll complete a second round
of scheduled bond purchases worth $600 billion through the end
of June to help sustain the recovery.  Investors Watching  “People are watching the Fed meeting on  interest rates  and
for any indication” on more quantitative easing, said Ronald Wan, Hong Kong-based managing director of China Merchants
Securities Co. “Sentiment today has been relatively positive
given the calmer economic outlook and after some positive
corporate results.”  Japanese exporters also gained as the yen weakened against
all its 16 major counterparts after S&P cut Japan’s sovereign
rating outlook. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income
at Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest carmaker, gained
1.5 percent to 3,100 yen in Tokyo. Nissan Motor Co., the
country’s No. 3 carmaker, rose 2.2 percent to 778 yen.  Fanuc
Corp. (6954) , the nation’s biggest maker of industrial robots,
increased 3.6 percent to 13,260 yen.  Origin Energy jumped 3.9 percent to A$16.87 in Sydney. The
company and its partner ConocoPhillips last week clinched
Australia’s largest liquefied-natural-gas export deal, agreeing
to supply 4.3 million metric tons of the fuel a year over two
decades to China Petrochemical.  Stock Rating  The Australia-Pacific LNG venture partners also agreed to
sell a 15 percent stake in the proposed $18.5 billion project in
Queensland state to China Petrochemical for $1.5 billion.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest
contract chipmaker, advanced 2.8 percent to NT$72.30 in Taipei
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. boosted its rating on the stock
to “buy” from “neutral” and raised its share-price forecast
to NT$90 from NT$64.  Compal Electronics Inc. (2324) , the world’s second-largest
contract maker of notebooks, gained 2.6 percent to NT$31.80
after announcing plans to pay a record NT$2.70 per share cash
dividend.  Kuraray Co., a Japanese fiber maker, surged 11 percent to
1,178 yen, the biggest advance on the regional benchmark index.
The company said full-year net income surged 76 percent to 28.7
billion yen ($352 million) on demand from  Europe , the U.S. and
China.  South Korean Builders  South Korean construction companies rallied after the
Edaily reported the government may announce measures to help
builders repay real-estate development loans, citing
Construction Minister Chung Jong Hwan.  Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co., South Korea’s No. 1
builder, surged 7.8 percent to 88,400 won in Seoul. GS
Engineering & Construction Corp., the country’s third-largest
builder, rose 5.4 percent to 127,000 won. Daewoo Engineering &
Construction Co., the fourth-biggest, increased 5.8 percent to
11,900 won.  Among stocks that declined, China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.,
the country’s second-largest mobile phone company, slid 2.5
percent to HK$15.36. The company said yesterday first-quarter
profit tumbled 86 percent to 166 million yuan ($25.5 million)
from a year earlier as it subsidized handsets to attract
customers. The result missed the 1.13 billion yuan median
forecast of four analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index advanced 0.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 7.1 percent by the S&P
500 and 2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
