Parker Hannifin Corp. (PH) , the maker of
components used in construction equipment and aircraft, fell the
most in three months in New York trading after operating margins
at half its divisions lagged behind an analyst’s estimates.  The shares dropped $5.01, or 5.1 percent, to $93.48 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, for
their biggest daily decline since Jan. 20. They have gained
8.3 percent this year.  The aerospace division posted a margin of 13.7 percent and
the climate unit had a margin of 8.5 percent in the fiscal third
quarter through March, lower than estimates from  Stephen Volkmann , a New York-based analyst with Jefferies Group Inc.
Volkmann rates the shares “hold.”  Parker lowered the top end of its  operating-margin
forecasts  today for three of four units. The Cleveland-based
company now expects margins of as much as 13.1 percent for
aerospace, 8.1 percent for climate and 16.5 percent for North
American industrial, down from  projections  of 13.9 percent,
8.8 percent and 16.8 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
