Three former champions will
compete in this year’s  New York City Marathon  among a field
that has attracted a record 140,000 applicants.  Defending champions Gebre Gebremariam of  Ethiopia  and
Edna Kiplagat of  Kenya  and 2009 winner Meb Keflezighi of
the U.S. committed to run the 26.2-mile race through New
York City’s five boroughs. U.S. Olympic champion short-
track speedskater Apolo Anton Ohno also will compete in the
Nov. 6 race, which he said will be his first marathon.  About 9,000 of the 45,000 total runners receive entry
through the race’s lottery system, the New York Road
Runners, which organizes the marathon, said in a news
release. Lottery winners are being announced today.  Keflezighi, 35, the first American man to win the race
since Alberto Salazar in 1982, will be joined by three-time
U.S. Olympian Jen Rhines, who will return to  New York  after
a five-year marathon hiatus. Keflezighi will be running the
race for the seventh time. He has five top-10 finishes,
including his 2009 victory and a sixth-place finish last
year.  Keflezighi will compete in the U.S. Olympic Marathon
Trials in Houston in January. In 2004, he won the silver
medal in the Olympic marathon in  Athens  and was the runner-
up in the New York City Marathon 70 days later.  In New York, he’ll run against Gebremariam, who won
last year’s race in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 14 seconds.
Gebremariam, 26, finished third at the Boston Marathon last
week in 2:04:53.  Kiplagat, 31, will defend her women’s title after
finishing third at last week’s London Marathon in 2:20:46.
She took second at the  New York City  Half Marathon in March
in 1:09:00.  Marathon Debut  Ohno, 28, is the most decorated U.S. Winter Olympian
with two gold, two silver and four bronze medals in short-
track speedskating.  “Running a marathon is something that I’ve never
done, and I am super excited to take on this incredible
challenge,” Ohno said in a news release. “I hope my
journey can serve as an inspiration for others to meet
their health goals.”  Rhines, 36, hasn’t competed in a marathon since
finishing fourth in 2006 in  Rome . She has focused on
shorter distances, winning the  USA Half Marathon 
Championship in January and the  USA 15k  title last month.  The New York race begins on  Staten Island  and winds
through  Brooklyn , Queens,  Manhattan  and the Bronx before
finishing in Central Park.  The 2010 event generated an economic impact of about
$340 million for the city, according to a Road Runners
survey of about 1,000 participants. The total, which
included about $30 million raised for charity, marked an
increase of about 25 percent since the last study, done in
2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
