The dollar touched a 16-month low
versus the euro on speculation the  Federal Reserve  may signal it
will hold interest rates low to support the  U.S. economy  after
its bond-buying program expires in June.  The yen weakened versus the euro and dollar after Standard
& Poor’s cut Japan’s outlook to negative.  Australia ’s currency
rose to a record versus the dollar as consumer prices climbed
the most since 2006. The greenback pared its drop against major
counterparts before Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  gives his first
press conference following a policy meeting.  “There is a huge assumption that the Fed is going to
maintain ultra-loose policy longer than the hawks on the
committee want, so the dollar is getting slammed all around,”
said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior market analyst at Interactive
Brokers Group in Greenwich,  Connecticut . “Investors have a
voracious risk appetite at this time. They’re picking on the
weaker currencies.”  The dollar slid 0.1 percent to $1.4662 against the euro at
11:55 a.m. in New York, from $1.4644 yesterday. It earlier
depreciated as much as 0.4 percent to $1.4714, the weakest level
since December 2009. The yen slipped 1.4 percent to 121.11
versus the euro, from 119.42. Japan’s currency declined 1.3
percent to 82.68 versus the dollar.  Stronger Pound  Sterling strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.6529 as Britain’s
 Office for National Statistics  said today that gross domestic
product expanded 0.5 percent in the first quarter, boosted by a
surge in the service industry.  The outlook on  Japan ’s AA- local-currency government debt
rating, the fourth-highest grade, was lowered from “stable,”
S&P said today, citing costs for rebuilding after the country’s
record earthquake on March 11.  The yen has weakened 5.2 percent over the past month in the
worst performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The
dollar has declined 4 percent.  Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa signaled in an
interview on April 25 that the central bank may expand a lending
program aimed at bolstering growth industries after the record
earthquake on March 11.  The Aussie rallied earlier on speculation the  Reserve Bank 
of Australia will raise borrowing costs to contain the South
Pacific nation’s accelerating inflation.  Australian Inflation  The  consumer price index  gained 1.6 percent in the three
months ended March 31, the most since June 2006, the Bureau of
Statistics said today. The median forecast of 26 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 1.2 percent gain.  The Aussie rose as much as 0.6 percent to $1.0852, the
highest level since the currency was freely floated in 1983,
before trading little changed at $1.0796. The  New Zealand dollar 
advanced as much as 0.6 percent to 81.08 U.S. cents, the
strongest level since March 2008, before dropping 0.4 percent to
80.22 U.S. cents.  The euro remained higher against the greenback after a
report showed European industrial orders gained for a fifth
consecutive month in February.  Aiming to keep annual inflation below 2 percent, the
 European Central Bank  raised its main refinancing rate this
month by a quarter-percentage point to 1.25 percent. It left the
door open for more increases even as nations such as  Greece ,
Ireland and Portugal struggle to contain sovereign-debt turmoil.  Greek Yield Surge  Greek two-year yields rose above 25 percent for the first
time, while 10-year bond yields advanced to euro-era highs for a
ninth consecutive day. Greece isn’t considering restructuring,
said an e-mail message from a Finance Ministry press officer who
cited government policy in asking not to be identified.  IntercontinentalExchange’s Dollar Index, which tracks the
greenback against the currencies of six major trading partners
including the euro, was little changed at 73.829 after touching
73.493, the lowest level in more than two years.  The U.S. central bank began a two-day policy meeting
yesterday that will be followed today by the Fed’s statement and
Bernanke’s press conference.  Fed officials will probably prepare to pull back from
record stimulus by dropping a pledge this year to hold the main
interest rate near zero for an “extended period,” according to
a Bloomberg News survey.  Thirty-three of 44 economists surveyed said the central
bank will remove the two-word phrase from its post-meeting
statement in 2011, with 18 betting it will move by September.
The Fed may wait until 2012 to announce sales of mortgage or
Treasury securities it bought to reduce borrowing costs, with 26
respondents expecting a plan next year, according to the survey,  To contact the reporter on this story:
