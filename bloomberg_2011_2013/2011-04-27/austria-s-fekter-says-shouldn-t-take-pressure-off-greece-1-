Maria Fekter,  Austria ’s finance
minister, said today she is “not a friend” of a Greek debt
restructuring because this would take pressure off the Greek
government to tackle its debt problems.  “I’m not a friend of a debt restructuring because this
would remove the pressure to execute reforms immediately, and
this is not in our interest,” Fekter told journalists in the
Austrian  finance ministry  in Vienna. “The better way is to keep
up the reform pressure,” Fekter added.  Growing investor concern that Greece won’t avoid defaulting
on its debt has sent Greek bond yields soaring to record levels
since April 14, when German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
was quoted as saying Greece may need to restructure its debt.  Fekter was appointed Austria’s new finance minister last
week after predecessor Josef Proell resigned for health reasons.  --John Simpson  To contact the reporter on this story:
