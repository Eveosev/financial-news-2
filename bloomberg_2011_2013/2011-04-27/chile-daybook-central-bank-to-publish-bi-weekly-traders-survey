*Sonda SA rose 2.8 percent to 1,254.6 pesos. Chile’s largest
information technology company had first-quarter net income of
12 billion pesos, beating the 10.7 billion-peso average estimate
of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  MARKETS:
*Chile’s peso rose to the strongest in three years, pushing
through the level that prompted the central bank to start buying
dollars, as the greenback slumped against the currencies of
major U.S. trading partners. The peso advanced 1.1 percent, the
biggest gain among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, to 462.67 per  U.S. dollar .
*Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market increased
bets against the peso to $1.5 billion on April 21 from a two-
month low of $832 million on April 20, according to central bank
data.
*The central bank auctioned two-year and five-year bonds in
pesos, paying 6.04 percent on the two-year, the most since 2008.
The 6.32 percent yield on the five years is less than it has
paid to borrow for five years in all other auctions this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
