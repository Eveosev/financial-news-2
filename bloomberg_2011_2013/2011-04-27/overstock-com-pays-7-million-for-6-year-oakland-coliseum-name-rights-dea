Overstock.com, a Web-based company
that sells merchandise at discounted prices, bought the naming
rights to the  Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum  for $7.2 million
over six years.  The  stadium , home to the  National Football League ’s Oakland
Raiders and  Major League Baseball ’s  Oakland Athletics , hosts
more than 100 events annually, including concerts and corporate
events.  The stadium hasn’t had a naming-rights sponsor since 2008
when McAfee Inc. declined to renew its agreement.  Salt Lake City-based Overstock.com will get stadium signs,
and Internet, television, radio and print promotion as part of
the agreement.  If a strike or other work stoppage cancels games, the
company will receive a pro-rated reduction in its payments,
according to Oakland’s Stadium Authority.  Overstock.com shares were up 10 cents to $14.94 at 1:24
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
