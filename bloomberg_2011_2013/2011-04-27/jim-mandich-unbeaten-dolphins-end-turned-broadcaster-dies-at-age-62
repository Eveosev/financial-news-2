Jim Mandich, a member of the Miami
Dolphins’ undefeated 1972 team who spent 40 years with the
franchise as a player and broadcaster, died yesterday after a
16-month fight with bile-duct cancer. He was 62.  Mandich was a tight end for the Dolphins from 1970 1977,
playing on two Super Bowl-winning teams. His 23 touchdowns are
the second-most by a tight end in team history.  Following his National Football League playing career,
Mandich spent 17 years with the Dolphins’ radio broadcast team
and was known for his “All Right, Miami!” catch phrase after
exciting plays.  “His passion for this team and this community will forever
live on among the generations of Dolphins fans who watched and
listened to him,” Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
