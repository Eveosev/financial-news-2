A Brazil consumer group is asking
the government to close a 15.6 billion-real ($9.9 billion) fund
that finances  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6)  and other
utilities with money from power bills,  Valor Economico  said.  The Abrace electricity consumers group is asking the
government to return the fund to electricity users, the groupâ€™s
president, Paulo Pedroso, told the newspaper in an interview.  The fund has lent 4.4 billion reais to Eletrobras, as the
state-run Rio de Janeiro-based utility is known, Valor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
