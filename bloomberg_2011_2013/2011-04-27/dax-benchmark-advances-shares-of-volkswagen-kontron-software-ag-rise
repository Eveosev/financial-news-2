German stocks advanced for a fifth

reported an increase in profit.  Volkswagen and Porsche jumped more than 4 percent, leading

of  business software , and  Kontron AG (KBC)  advanced after posting
higher first-quarter net income.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  rose 0.7 percent to 7,404.95 at the

in the Middle East and north Africa. The broader HDAX Index

Bloomberg survey predict the Fed will keep the main interest
rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, its level since

billion of Treasury purchases, dubbed QE2 for the second round
of quantitative easing, will end as planned in June, said  John Silvia , chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC in
 Charlotte ,  North Carolina .  ‘Supporting Financial Markets’  “Liquidity from the Fed is still fully supporting
financial markets,” said Ansgar Krekeler, a Dusseldorf-based
sales analyst at WGZ Bank AG. “ Wall Street  will most likely
welcome a QE3 program and should already start pricing it.”  Volkswagen reported record operating profit in the first
quarter of 2011 as Chinese demand for the VW and Audi brands
continued to climb, boosting the shares 4.8 percent to 126.50

making division reported a first-quarter profit gain after a
