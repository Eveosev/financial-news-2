KenolKobil Ltd., a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, said it
acquired a depot complex in Tanzania from World Oil Ltd. on a
25-year lease arrangement.  The facility consists of a fuel depot with a storage
capacity of 33,000 cubic meters, an office block and two dry
cargo warehouses that can be used to store liquid-petroleum-gas
cylinders and lubricants, the Nairobi-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
