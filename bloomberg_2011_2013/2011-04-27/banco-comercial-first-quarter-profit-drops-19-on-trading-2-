Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) ,
Portugal’s biggest non-state bank in terms of assets, said
third-quarter profit dropped 19 percent to 77.7 million euros
($114.2 million), as trading income fell.  Analysts had predicted a net income of 74 million euros for
the period. Net interest income rose 18 percent to 401.6 million
euros, while net trading income dropped to 23.7 million euros
from 135.4 million euros a year earlier, the Oporto, Portugal-
based lender said today in a regulatory  filing .  The decline in trading income was mainly due to a drop in
the value of Portuguese bonds that the lender holds, Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Santos Ferreira said in a press
conference today in Lisbon. The bank has 2.5 billion euros in
Portuguese bonds, he said.  Banco Comercial’s loan book is shrinking as  Portugal ’s
financial crisis has made access to wholesale funding more
difficult for Portuguese banks. Loans declined 2.4 percent from
a year earlier, led by a 6.1 percent drop in lending to
companies. A wider gap between the rates Banco Comercial charged
for loans and the rates it paid for funds enabled net interest
income to grow.  The bank reduced its ratio of loans to deposits to 147
percent, from 160 percent in last year’s second quarter, and
said it has a target of 120 percent for 2013.  Banco Comercial’s core tier 1 capital ratio, which stood at
6.7 percent in the first quarter, will be roughly 9 percent
after it carries out a capital increase approved this month by
shareholders, the bank said in a  presentation .  To contact the reporter on this story:
