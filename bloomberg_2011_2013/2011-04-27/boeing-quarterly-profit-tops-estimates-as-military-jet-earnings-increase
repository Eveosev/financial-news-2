Boeing Co. (BA)  promised to deliver the
first 787 Dreamliner by September as planned after three years
of delays and to ship as many as 20 in 2011 as mechanics rework
finished planes to meet new specifications.  Dreamliners will need to be modified through next year in
the “factory within a factory” set up in Everett,  Washington ,
where Chicago-based Boeing builds all its wide-body jets, Chief
Executive Officer Jim McNerney said today on a conference call.  Boeing’s fixes include replacing some fasteners to
accommodate design changes made during the testing process for
the plastic-composite jetliner. The company set a target of
shipping the initial 787 in the third quarter, accounted for the
reworking in the schedule and is “very confident” at least a
dozen jets will reach airlines this year, McNerney said.  “There’s no mystery to getting it done,” McNerney said.
“We understand the work statement, the fix, the work-around,
the change that has to be made, and it’s a matter of scheduling
it and getting it done.”  Boeing has completed 95 percent of the tests required for
certification to fly passengers in models equipped with engines
from Rolls-Royce Plc, McNerney said. Trials for planes with
 General Electric Co. (GE)  engines are about 75 percent done, he said.  Still ahead are tests for function, reliability and
extended operations before the U.S.  Federal Aviation
Administration  will certify the Dreamliner for passenger use,
McNerney said.  Quarterly Profit  McNerney commented after Boeing’s first-quarter profit beat
analysts’ estimates, buoyed by military jet earnings that helped
blunt declines in commercial-airplane deliveries by the world’s
largest aerospace company.  Net income rose 13 percent to $586 million, or 78 cents a
share, surpassing the 70-cent average estimate of 21 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit was $519 million, or 70 cents a
share, a year earlier, when earnings were hurt by a one-time
charge of $150 million, Boeing said.  Boeing climbed 57 cents to $76.12 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading, extending this year’s gain to
17 percent. The shares are down 25 percent since Oct. 9, 2007,
the day before the first 787 setback was announced, compared
with a 13 percent drop for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a
10 percent decline on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  The company’s story “remains much more about new order
activity and delivering on the 787 and 747-8 programs than it
does about near-term EPS,” Noah Poponak, an analyst with
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in New York, wrote in a note to clients
today. He reiterated his “buy” recommendation.  Commercial Deliveries  Commercial deliveries still are set to rise to 485 to 500
aircraft in 2011, from 462 last year, even after four fewer
shipments in the first three months. Companywide sales fell 2
percent to $14.9 billion in the quarter, said Boeing, which
reaffirmed its full-year forecast for net income of $3.80 to $4
a share on revenue of $68 billion to $71 billion.  Production increases of about 40 percent over the next
three years are being put into effect in 2011 as orders recover
from the recession-induced slump and new models enter service.
Among the changes will be a ramp-up to 2.5 Dreamliners a month
from 2 now, reaching 10 in late 2013, McNerney said.  The increased output will compel Boeing to keep adding
jobs, McNerney said, adding that there’s pressure to raise
manufacturing rates even higher.  Airbus Effect  Profit in the commercial airplanes division fell 25 percent
to $509 million, while sales slid to $7.1 billion as 777
deliveries slipped. Shipments of the twin-aisle jet, Boeing’s
most profitable, dropped to 13 from 19 a year earlier. The
commercial backlog rose to more than 3,400 aircraft valued at
$263 billion, from $256 billion at the end of December.  McNerney said the 747-8 freighter’s testing is 75 percent
complete and the plane, the biggest Boeing has ever built, is
poised to be delivered to the first customer in the middle of
this year.  Airbus SAS, which has led Boeing in annual deliveries since
2003, isn’t snagging the U.S. planemaker’s customers with the
A320neo model, McNerney said. That plane, a version of the
existing A320 equipped with new engines and due to arrive in
2015, shouldn’t “seriously” erode Boeing’s customer base as
long as a new narrow-body jet is ready by 2019 or 2020, he said.  Boeing is still looking at new technology and demand in the
single-aisle market and will make a decision on what to do later
this year, McNerney said.  Military Aircraft  In the military aircraft unit, profit climbed 37 percent to
$369 million, reflecting lower research expenses after Boeing
won contracts that had been in development, including the U.S.
Air Force’s new aerial refueling tanker.  Earnings for the entire Defense, Space & Security business
increased 1 percent to $671 million on rising sales of Chinook
helicopters.  Boeing is considering purchases in the areas of cyber
security, unmanned systems, services and so-called C4ISR, or
communications, surveillance and reconnaissance, McNerney said.  After 10 acquisitions by the defense unit in the past three
years, that business is “comfortable” with that purchase pace,
Boeing Defense President Dennis Muilenburg said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
