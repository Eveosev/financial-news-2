Hungary’s government will today
present new legislation to punish vigilantes wearing uniforms
and engaging in unauthorized law-enforcement activity, said
 Peter Szijjarto , Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s spokesman.  Members of uniform-wearing group Vedero last week planned
military-style exercises in the eastern Hungarian town of
Gyongyospata, which Roma residents said was aimed at
intimidating them. Four people were injured in overnight clashes
in the town, news portal  Index  reported today.  The new legislation will be a "slap in the face of
uniformed crime," on those wearing uniforms without permission
or clothing that resembles official uniforms, Szijjarto told
reporters today in parliament. Intimidating others by attempting
to impose order will be punishable with as much as 3 years in
prison if the action threatens a specific community, he said.  “Those walking around in uniform, pretending they are
authorized to take measures against others, these people are
criminals,” Szijjarto said. “We’ll stop this form of crime.”  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
