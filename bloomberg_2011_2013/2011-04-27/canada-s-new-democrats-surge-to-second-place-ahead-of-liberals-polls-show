The  New Democratic Party  has become
the second-most popular political party in  Canada  ahead of the
May 2 federal election, three polls show.  The NDP has 30 percent support among decided voters,
according to an Angus Reid Public Opinion  poll , conducted for
the Toronto Star and La Presse newspapers. The governing
 Conservative Party  has 35 percent support, while the Liberals,
who had the second-most seats in the House of Commons, have 22
percent. The online poll surveyed 2,040 Canadian adults on April
25 and 26. It carries a margin of error of 2.2 percent, 19 times
out of 20.  The pro-labor NDP has surged in voter support, particularly
in Quebec, since leader  Jack Layton ’s performance in two
televised debates this month. The NDP is now the most popular
party in the French-speaking province, the survey showed.  The Angus Reid poll was supported by two other polls that
showed the NDP in second place nationally and leading in  Quebec .
The latest CTV/Globe/Nanos tracking poll gives the NDP 28
percent support, 10 percentage points behind the Conservatives and
five percentage points ahead of the Liberals. The telephone survey
of 1,200 adults was conducted by Nanos Research April 23 to April
26 and has a margin of error of 2.8 percent.  A  poll  by Ekos Research taken for iPolitics.ca shows the
 New Democrats  with 28 percent support, compared with 34 percent
for the Conservatives and 24 percent for the Liberals. The
telephone survey of 2,532 adults was taken April 23 to April 25
and has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.  In the 2008  election , the Conservatives won 143 seats with
38 percent of the vote, while the NDP won 37 seats with 18
percent. The Liberals took 77 seats with 26 percent of the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
