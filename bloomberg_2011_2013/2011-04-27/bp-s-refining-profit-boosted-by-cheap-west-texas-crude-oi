BP Plc (BP/) ’s profit from refining and
marketing in the first quarter surged 185 percent from a year
earlier because it was able to use cheaper  crude oil  at some of
its U.S. plants and because of higher petrochemical prices.  Replacement cost profit before interest and tax climbed to
$2.079 billion from 729 million in the same quarter of 2010, the
London-based company said today in a statement.  West Texas Intermediate oil has been cheaper than other
types of crude because of high stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma,
the delivery point for futures contracts.  “There was strong refining feedstock optimization in the
U.S., due to BP’s location advantage in accessing WTI-priced
crude grades, and strength in petrochemicals’ aromatics margins
and volumes,” according to the statement.  The amount of oil processed by BP refineries in the first
quarter declined to 2.269 million barrels a day, compared with
2.428 million barrels a year earlier, because of “higher
turnaround activities at the Texas City refinery,” BP said in
the statement.  WTI crude futures for June delivery, a benchmark for U.S.
refiners, traded at $112.09 a barrel in  New York  today. It was
$12.07 a barrel cheaper than North Sea Brent crude in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
