Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest
maker of cameras, climbed the most in more than a year in Tokyo
trading on speculation the company’s revised forecasts for
profit and sales this year were conservative.  Canon rose as much as 6.9 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since December 2009, and traded up 6.4 percent at 3,720 yen
as of 1:23 p.m. in Tokyo.  Japan ’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami will cost the
Tokyo-based company about 314.4 billion yen ($3.9 billion) in
lost sales and 197.7 billion yen in operating income this year,
Canon said yesterday while paring its earnings forecasts. Those
costs were “within the assumption,” Citigroup Inc. said.  “The market reacted because it’s very likely Canon will
reach its next fiscal year earnings forecast,” said Masahiro Shibano, a Tokyo-based analyst for Citigroup. “The market
expects that Canon can get back to its full production level in
the second half of the year.”  Net income in the year ending in December will probably
fall 11 percent to 220 billion yen, Canon said yesterday,
abandoning its previous forecast for a 26 percent increase. The
company slashed its compact camera sales target to 20 million
units from 23 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
