Turkey is making plans to counter
the risk of deepening chaos in neighboring  Syria  as Syrian
President Bashar Al-Assad’s crackdown on protests escalates,
Sabah newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said he will send a
delegate to meet with Assad today, while plans for a possible
civil war in the country will be discussed at a national
security council meeting, the newspaper reported from Ankara.  Erdogan spoke with Assad by telephone yesterday and told
him that while the lifting of the emergency rule was a positive
step, it was insufficient to meet protesters’ demands and quell
the unrest, Sabah said. The conversation followed a call the
previous day between Erdogan and U.S. President  Barack Obama , it
said.  Turkey considers it likely that Syrians may flee the
country and has designated areas for refugee camps and hospitals
in the cities of Hatay, Kilis, Gaziantep, Sanliurfa and Mardin
near the Syrian border, it said. Additional mine-sweeping
equipment has been sent to police stations in the area, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
