Taiwan’s dollar rose to the
strongest level in more than two months on speculation global
funds will add to holdings of local assets as the  Federal
Reserve  uses near-zero  interest rates  to aid the  U.S. economy .  The Fed will leave its target rate for overnight lending
between banks at zero to 0.25 percent today, according to all 83
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. That compares with
Taiwan’s benchmark interest rate of 1.75 percent. Overseas
investors bought $423 million more local shares than they sold
today, boosting net purchases for the month to $2.9 billion,
exchange data show.  “Investors expect the Fed will not do much and will
maintain its cheap money policy,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-
income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “That’s
supporting the  Taiwan dollar .”  Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to NT$28.900 against its
U.S. counterpart as of its 4 p.m. local close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$28.809 earlier, the
strongest level since Feb. 10. It’s appreciated 1.8 percent this
month.  Government bonds  fell. The yield on the 1 percent note due
January 2016, the most-active government security, gained one
basis point to 1.082 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market.  Data this week is expected to show Taiwan’s economy
expanded 5 percent from a year earlier in the first three months
of 2011, after 6.9 percent growth in the previous quarter,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
