Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC) , the world’s
biggest producer of pulverized coal used to make steel, said
third-quarter sales fell 61 percent after rains curbed output at
its mines in  Australia ’s Bowen Basin.  Total sales dropped to 476,300 metric tons in the quarter
ended March 31, compared with 1.23 million a year earlier,
Brisbane-based Macarthur said today in a statement. That
compares with an estimate of 600,000 tons from UBS AG.  Heavy rain and flooding in Queensland state in November
through January inundated mines and prompted companies including
Macarthur and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  to notify customers they would
miss shipments. Force majeure, the legal clause invoked by
companies when they can’t meet obligations because of
circumstances beyond their control, remains in place with all
customers, Macarthur said after first declaring on Dec. 3.  Macarthur, which has dropped 25 percent the past year, fell
1.9 percent to A$11.95 at 2:22 p.m. Sydney time, compared with a
0.6 percent decline in the benchmark index.  The curbing of supply has pushed prices higher and  Japan ’s
 Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406)  said last month it had agreed to pay Rio Tinto
Group a record $330 a ton for hard coking coal under three-month
contracts from April 1. The deal was struck before an earthquake
hit the country, halting some steel output.  Supply contracts for the quarter starting April 1 were
agreed “in line with market settlements of metallurgical
coal,” Macarthur said, without providing price details.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  won a 53 percent increase in contract
prices for pulverized coal used in steelmaking to $275 a ton
from South Korea’s  Posco (005490) , Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty
said March 23.  Coal Output  Output declined 56 percent to 523,200 tons during the
quarter, compared with 1.18 million tons a year earlier,
Macarthur said. It cut its full-year sales forecast to a range
of 4.1 million tons to 4.3 million tons, from a Feb. 18 target
of 5 million tons.  Gloucester Coal Ltd. (GCL)  sales fell 6 percent to 496,000 tons
in the quarter ended March 31, the Sydney-based company said in
a separate statement. It has two mines in New South Wales
state’s Gloucester region and a 50 percent stake in the
Middlemount project in the Bowen Basin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
