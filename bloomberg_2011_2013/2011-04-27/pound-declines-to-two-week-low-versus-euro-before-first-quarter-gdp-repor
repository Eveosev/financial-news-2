The pound reached a two-week low
against the euro before a report forecast to show Britainâ€™s
economy resumed growth in the first quarter.  Sterling was little changed versus the dollar. Gross
domestic product expanded 0.5 percent after contracting 0.5 in
the fourth quarter, according to the median estimate of 28
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The pound slipped 0.2 percent to 89.01 pence per euro as of
7:37 a.m. in  London  after reaching 89.15 pence, the weakest
level since April 13. Sterling was little changed at $1.6478.  To contact the reporter on this story:
