Kenya’s economy will expand between
4.5 percent and 5 percent this year,  British American
Investments Co. Kenya Ltd.  said, lowering its previous forecast
on concern that rising inflation will lead to higher  interest
rates .  The estimate was cut from a projection of as much as 6
percent, Dominic Kiarie, managing director of British American’s
asset-management unit, told reporters today in Nairobi, Kenya’s
capital. It is also lower than the government’s outlook of 5.7
percent made on March 23.  “Drought, inflation risks and higher energy prices are
likely to dampen the 2011 growth prospects,” Kiarie said.
British American expects a “tighter monetary policy by the
central bank,” he said.  The inflation rate in East Africa’s largest  economy  may
hover between 9 percent and 11 percent for the rest of the year,
higher than the government’s 5 percent forecast, British
American said in a presentation.  The Central Bank of  Kenya  raised its benchmark interest
rate last month by a quarter of a percentage point to 6 percent
to counter rising price pressures.  Inflation accelerated for a fifth consecutive month in
March to 9.19 percent as fuel became more expensive following
unrest in the Middle East. Surging food costs, which make up 36
percent of Kenya’s consumer-price basket, have been blamed on
unseasonably dry weather and climbing global commodity prices.  “The  food supply  will remain an issue in the medium-term
with looming drought,” British American said in its
presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
