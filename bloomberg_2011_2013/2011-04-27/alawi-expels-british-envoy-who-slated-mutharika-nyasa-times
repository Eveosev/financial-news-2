Malawi’s government decided to
expel Britain’s High Commissioner to the African nation after he
described President Bingu wa Mutharika as combative and
autocratic in a leaked memo, the  Nyasa Times  reported.  Fergus Cochrane-Dyet was declared “persona non grata”
yesterday, the newspaper said, citing another internal memo from
the High Commission’s office.  The press and political affairs assistant at the
commission, Lewis Kulisewa, couldn’t confirm or deny the report.
Malawian Information Minister Vuwa Kaunda refused to comment,
while Foreign Affairs Minister Etta Banda couldn’t be reached.  “We will issue a statement on that before noon today,”
Kulisewa said by phone from the capital, Lilongwe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
