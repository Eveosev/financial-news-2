China ’s money-market rate dropped
the most in two months on speculation maturing debt will add
cash into the financial system.  Central bank bills and  repurchase agreements  totaling 177
billion yuan ($27.2 billion) matured in the first two days of
this week, according to Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial
Bank Co. The People’s Bank of China sold 3 billion yuan of one-
year bills yesterday, the least in seven weeks, and held off
offering 28-day repurchase agreements.  “The maturing bills are helping ease the cash shortage,”
said Shanghai-based Guo. “The decline in bill amount shows the
central bank probably doesn’t want to see a severe cash
squeeze.”  The seven-day repurchase rate dropped 66 basis points, the
most since Feb. 24, to 3.73 percent as of 9:59 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. The measure of interbank funding
availability touched 4.44 percent yesterday, the highest level
since Feb. 23.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined two
basis points to 3.42 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.22 percent government bond due March
2014 was unchanged at 3.26 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Ven Ram, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
