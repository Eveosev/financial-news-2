An ex-Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
brokerage executive took his fight for $19.6 million in bonuses
to a higher court after a bankruptcy judge said  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
didn’t agree to be bound by his Lehman contract when it bought
the brokerage.  Maximilian Coreth, hired as a managing director of the
Lehman Brothers Inc. brokerage’s fixed income division in April
2008, was granted a base salary of $200,000 and a bonus of
$9.8 million for each of 2008 and 2009, according to court
documents. If dismissed without cause, he was entitled to two
years’ bonuses totaling $19.6 million.  A U.S. court confirmed that London-based Barclays wouldn’t
be subjected to so-called successor liability when it bought the
defunct firm’s North American business in 2008, U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge James Peck wrote in February as he dismissed Coreth’s
suit. Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008.  Offering jobs to Coreth and another ex-Lehman employee,
“Barclays states that as a Barclays employee, you will continue
to receive your current base salary or applicable commission
based remuneration,” the judge wrote. “Barclays did not make
any commitment in either of the e-mails offering employment to
make any bonus payment or assume any obligation arising under
any LBI employment contract.”  Michael O’Looney, a Barclays spokesman, declined to comment
on the appeal, made in U.S. District Court in  New York .  Time on Job  Coreth, who joined Lehman from Morgan Stanley, worked for
Barclays from September 2008 to October 2008, when he was fired,
according to his 2009 lawsuit. The bank “repudiated its
severance obligations” in agreeing to pay severance of
$1,960,000, which was about one-tenth of the amount promised by
Lehman, he said in the suit.  The main case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , 08-
13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
( Manhattan ). Coreth’s appeal is In Re Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., 1:11-cv-02792, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
