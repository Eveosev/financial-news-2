Cotton traded in Zhengzhou may drop
12 percent from yesterday’s close to 24,000 yuan ($3,685) a
metric ton by June, according to  technical analysis  from Beijing
Capital Futures Co.  The 24,000 yuan level is estimated using point and figure
chart analysis, Huang Xiao, research manager at the Beijing-
based brokerage, said by e-mail yesterday. The attached chart
shows futures may first decline to about 26,700 yuan, one of the
levels indicated by so-called Fibonacci analysis.  At about 26,700 yuan “support is weak so if cotton falls
through this level, it’ll go straight for 24,000 yuan,” Huang
said. “No other agricultural product exhibits a more obvious
declining trend than cotton,” he said. The contract closed at
27,275 yuan a ton yesterday on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange.  Cotton futures in China have plunged more than 20 percent
since reaching a record 34,870 yuan a ton on Feb. 17 on concern
high prices and the government’s tightening of lending will hurt
demand in the world’s biggest consumer. The contract for
September traded at 27,000 yuan a ton at 9:51 a.m. Beijing time.  Beijing Capital Futures, a member of  China ’s three
commodity futures exchanges, is a subsidiary of state-owned
Beijing Capital Group Ltd., an infrastructure and investment
holding company owned by the municipal government of Beijing.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low. A point and figure chart gauges
trends in prices without showing time.  --William Bi. With assistance from Lee Miller. Editor: James Poole  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
