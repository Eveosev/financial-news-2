Ethanol futures declined for the
first time in a week in Chicago as corn prices dropped.  The biofuel and the grain both fell after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the bank will end its $600 billion
bond-buying program in June, sparking speculation that commodity
demand will wane. One bushel of corn distills into at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  “Ethanol was just a little weaker,” said Jim Damask,
manager at BiofuelsConnect, a Heathrow, Florida-based
alternative energy broker. “It was actually pretty strong
compared to what happened in the grains. With corn coming off
and a lot of inventories,” it fell.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery was down 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.635 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have risen 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.72 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive lost 2
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.705, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast increased 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.765 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel increased
0.5 cent to $2.62.  Corn for July delivery tumbled 13.5 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to $7.5925 a bushel in Chicago. The grain is the primary
ingredient used to produce ethanol in the U.S.  An Energy Department report released today in  Washington 
showed stockpiles of the fuel sank 4 percent to 19.3 million
barrels, enough to supply the market for 22.8 days. That’s 6
percent below the record 20.5 million in storage on April 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
