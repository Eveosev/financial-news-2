China Minsheng Banking Corp., the
nationâ€™s first non-state lender, said first-quarter profit rose
a more-than-expected 45 percent on higher income from loans and
fee-based services.  Net income rose to 6.21 billion yuan ($954 million), or
0.23 yuan a share, from 4.27 billion yuan, or 0.16 yuan, a year
earlier, the Beijing-based lender said in a  statement  to the
Hong Kong stock exchange today. That beat the 5.69 billion yuan
median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Net interest income climbed 33 percent to 13.4 billion yuan
from a year earlier and net non-interest income increased 43
percent to 2.95 billion yuan.  Chinese banks including Minsheng are boosting provisions
for bad debt after regulators grew concerned that defaults on
property loans and credit to local government financing vehicles
may climb. Minsheng set aside 1.79 billion yuan against
potential bad loans in the first quarter, compared with 1.2
billion yuan a year earlier.  Its bad debt ratio was 0.66 percent at the end of March,
compared with 0.69 percent in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
