Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers believe the reasons behind a
slowdown during the first quarter do not appear to be long-
lasting.  “I would say roughly most of the slowdown in the first
quarter is viewed by most on the committee as transitory,”
Bernanke said to reporters today during the first-ever press
conference following a Federal Open Market Committee meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
