Track cycling, triathlon and
equestrian competitions are among the more than 50 percent of
events in the 2012 Olympics that are oversubscribed and will go
to ballot, the organizers of the London Games said.  Rhythmic gymnastics, modern pentathlon and the opening and
closing ceremonies also have more ticket applications than seats
available, the organizers said today in an e-mailed statement.  More than 20 million tickets were applied for, with about
1.8 million people making applications, the operators said. More
than half of the 650 sessions will go to a ticket lottery as
part of the process, which ended last night and made 6.6 million
seats available for events in next yearâ€™s Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
