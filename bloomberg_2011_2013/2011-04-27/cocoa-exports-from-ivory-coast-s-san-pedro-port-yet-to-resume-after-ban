Ivory Coast ’s western port at  San
Pedro  has yet to resume cocoa exports after the end of a post-
election crisis that halted all shipments in March, the harbor
authority said.  “For the moment, loading cocoa ships has not yet resumed,”
according to a statement e-mailed from the harbor today.  Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa producer, saw
shipments of beans plummet after President-elect Alassane Ouattara banned exports of cocoa and coffee in a bid to starve
his rival,  Laurent Gbagbo , of funds.  Gbagbo, who clung to the presidency for more than four
months after losing a November election to Ouattara, was
captured in Abidjan, the commercial capital, on April 11. The
ban was lifted four days later and the ports resumed work on
April 18.  San Pedro’s shipments of rubber dropped 75 percent to 2,149
metric tons in March, while exports of  palm oil  rose 47 percent
to 20,929 tons, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
