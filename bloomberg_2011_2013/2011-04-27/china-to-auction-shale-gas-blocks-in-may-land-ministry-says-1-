China will offer shale-gas blocks
to domestic energy companies in an auction next month, said
Zhang Dawei, deputy director of oil and gas strategy research at
the Ministry of Land and Resources.  The government will offer six shale-gas exploration blocks
to PetroChina Co.,  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) ,  Cnooc Ltd. (883) 
and Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum Group Co., Zhang said Oct. 27.
The government originally planned to open the auction in
November. Zhang declined to give further details today when
contacted on his mobile phone.  China aims to tap its unconventional gas resources,
including gas in shale, to help cut reliance on oil and coal.
The country may have 26 trillion cubic meters of shale-gas
reserves, more than 10 times its proven holdings of conventional
natural gas, Zhang said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
