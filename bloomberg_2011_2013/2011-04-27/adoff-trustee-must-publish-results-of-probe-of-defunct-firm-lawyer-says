The trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff’s defunct firm must publish the results of his probe in
the case after spending more than two years and almost
$300 million on it, a lawyer for Madoff investors said.  “The trustee has provided none of this information to the
customers, to whom he owes a fiduciary duty,” the lawyer, Helen Chaitman, said in a filing yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
 Manhattan  on behalf of 1,200 Madoff investors. “The customers
now move to compel him to fulfill his statutory obligation.”  Trustee Irving Picard, appointed after Madoff’s December
2008 arrest, has “represented” that he exhaustively
investigated the Madoff firm, pursuing its property and tracing
customer deposits and withdrawals, Chaitman wrote. Firms
retained by the trustee were paid more than $288 million over
two years, she said, citing government documents.  Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, declined to comment.  The trustee has filed more than 1,000 lawsuits seeking to
recoup customers’ money. He said this month in a filing that he
had recovered $7.6 billion, or 44 percent of the principal lost.  The case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard
L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
