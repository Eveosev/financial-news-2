The Ghanaian cedi weakened as
companies sought dollars to bring imported  consumer goods  into
the West African nation.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
declined 0.5 percent to 1.5045 at 2 p.m. in the capital, Accra,
from a close yesterday of 1.4970.  “The traders bought the dollars to import their wares,
mostly consumer goods,” Kwabena Owusu, a currency trader at
Access Bank Ghana Ltd. said by phone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
