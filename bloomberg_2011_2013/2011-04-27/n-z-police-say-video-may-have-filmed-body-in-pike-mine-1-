New Zealand police said video
equipment may have captured the first image of a body in the
 Pike River Coal Ltd. (PRC)  mine on the nation’s  South Island , where 29
men died in an underground explosion in November.  The image of an object, which was taken in February, has
been examined by a forensic pathologist who indicated “that in
his view the shape is suspiciously that of a body,” police said
today in an e-mailed  statement . Families of the dead men were
informed yesterday.  In January, the chief coroner determined the men die during
or shortly after the first explosion at the mine on Nov. 19.
Police have stopped efforts to recover bodies from the mine and
handed the pit back to the outside managers of the company to
secure the mine safely.  The image, of a fully clothed person lying face down, was
obtained by a camera lowered down a bore hole. Further analysis
is required and police may source a different device from the
U.S. to get better images, Assistant Commissioner Grant Nicholls
said in the statement.  Police also said images of three equipment boxes in the
mine have been scrutinized. Preliminary indications are that one
of those, containing fire-fighting equipment, appears to be
open, Nicholls said.  Tony Kokshoorn, mayor of the nearby town of Greymouth where
many of the miners lived, urged the managers of the company to
recover the bodies or pass the responsibility to an organization
that could, the  Press  newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
