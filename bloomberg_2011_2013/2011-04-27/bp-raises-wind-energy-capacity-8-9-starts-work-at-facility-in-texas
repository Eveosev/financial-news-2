BP Plc (BP) ,  Europe ’s second-largest oil
company, said it increased its capacity to generate power from
the wind by 8.9 percent in the first quarter and began building
a wind farm in Texas.  The company, which is focusing its wind energy efforts in
the U.S., reported a net generation capacity of 774 megawatts
compared with 711 megawatts for the same period a year earlier.
Including wind projects where BP has partial ownership, those
figures are 1,362 megawatts for the first quarter compared with
1,237 megawatts a year ago.  The London-based company, which started its clean power
unit  BP Alternative Energy  in 2005, said it began building the
150-megawatt Sherbino 2 wind farm in Pecos County,  Texas . It
also spent $390 million on turbines for future projects in the
fourth quarter of last year, according to the  statement 
detailing the company’s earnings today.  BP currently operates 10 wind farms in seven U.S. states
where the climate and public policy favor the technology,
according to the company website. It has a further 1,000
megawatts in an advanced stage of development. The company also
operates 32 megawatts of wind capacity in the Netherlands.  BP pledged to invest $8 billion over 10 years when it
started BP Alternative Energy, an average of $800 million a
year. By the end of last year, it had already invested $5
billion, Katrina Landis, chief executive officer of the unit,
said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
