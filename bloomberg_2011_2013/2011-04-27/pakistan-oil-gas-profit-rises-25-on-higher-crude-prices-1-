Oil & Gas Development Co.,
 Pakistan ’s biggest energy explorer, posted a 25 percent increase
in third-quarter profit after crude prices rose.  Net income in the three months ended March 31 climbed to
17.6 billion rupees ($208 million), or 4.09 rupees a share, from
14.1 billion rupees, or 3.28 rupees, a year earlier, the
Islamabad-based company said in a filing to the  Karachi Stock
Exchange  today. Sales rose 15 percent to 41.2 billion rupees.  “Like other energy companies, the main driver for profit
growth is the crude price rise,” Farhan Bashir Khan, a research
analyst at Invest Capital & Securities Ltd. in Karachi, said
before the earnings announcement. Khan has a “hold”
recommendation on the stock.  Pakistan, which imports 80 percent of its petroleum
consumption, needs to increase oil and natural gas production to
help meet demand. The country’s depleting energy resources
prompted the government to increase gas prices in line with
international rates in a bid to encourage exploration and help
meet demand.  The price of Arab Light Crude rose 26 percent to $111.89 a
barrel on March 31 from Dec. 31, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Oil & Gas Development, which has fallen 18 percent this
year, rose 1.1 percent to 140.50 rupees as of 2:30 p.m. local
time on the Karachi Stock Exchange. The company plans to pay an
interim cash dividend of 1.50 rupees a share, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
