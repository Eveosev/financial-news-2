Spain ’s central government and
regions agreed to tighten local administrations’ deficit target
for 2014 and approved seven regions’ budget-cutting programs.  The regions will aim for a combined budget deficit of 1
percent of gross domestic product in 2014, down from 1.3 percent
this year and next and 1.1 percent in 2013, Finance Minister
Elena Salgado told a news conference after meeting local finance
chiefs in  Madrid  today.  The agreement on spending programs is a requirement before
regions can issue debt in capital markets. Six plans remain
pending including those of Catalonia and Castilla-La Mancha,
Salgado said. Some of those that weren’t ratified need “minor
adjustments” and should be agreed on at a similar meeting that
will be called “as soon as possible” after regional elections
on May 22, she said.  Spain’s regions are crucial to the country’s efforts to cut
the euro area’s third-largest deficit as they control health and
education spending and employ about half of all public workers.
The region of Catalonia, Spain’s largest, had a budget shortfall
of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product last year, above the
2.4 percent target, while Castilla-La Mancha’s deficit was the
widest at 6.5 percent.  “The autonomous regions are on the path toward bringing
their deficits into line with what we have agreed and so I’m not
worried at all” about the regions, Salgado said.  Questioned on the succession race to replace European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet , Salgado said that
Italy’s  Mario Draghi  is an “excellent” candidate although the
period for presenting candidates hasn’t opened yet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
