The Rwandan Development Bank took
control of  Banque de lâ€™Habitat du Rwanda  as part of a plan to
boost mortgage lending in the East African country, the  New
Times  reported, citing Finance Minister John Rwangombwa.  The merged operations of the two state-owned institutions
will have a combined asset value of 72 billion Rwandan francs
($120 million), the Kigali-based newspaper said.  Mortgage lending in  Rwanda  is currently about 15 percent to
20 percent of the 420 billion-franc loan book of commercial
banks in the country, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
