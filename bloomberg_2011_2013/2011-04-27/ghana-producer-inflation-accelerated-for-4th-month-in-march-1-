Ghana ’s producer-price inflation
rate rose for the fourth consecutive month in March as the costs
of mining and quarrying increased.  Factory-gate inflation accelerated to 23.4 percent from
22.3 percent a month earlier,  Grace Bediako , a statistician with
the  Ghana  Statistical Service, told reporters in Accra, the
capital, today.  “Costs in the mining and quarrying industries accelerated
fastest compared with all other sectors during the month,” she
said.  Prices in those two industries, which make up 14 percent of
the index, rose 32.3 percent in March, compared with 27.9
percent the month before.  The producer-price inflation rate started to climb after
hitting a 14-month low of 16 percent in November.  Manufacturing costs that make up 70 percent of the index
rose an annual 11.6 percent in March, compared with 11.2 percent
the month before, Bediako said. Utility costs increased 72
percent, little changed from 71.9 percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
