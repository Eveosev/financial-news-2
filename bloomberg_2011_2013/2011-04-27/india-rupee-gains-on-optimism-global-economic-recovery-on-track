India ’s rupee advanced, snapping a
three-day decline, as increases in U.S. corporate profits fueled
optimism the global economic recovery is on track, boosting
demand for emerging-market assets.  The rupee strengthened the most in a week as the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index of regional shares advanced 0.2 percent. Overseas
investors bought $1.8 billion more Indian shares than they sold
this month as U.S. companies, including Apple Inc. and Ford
Motor Co., reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  “There’s more optimism across the world’s financial
markets as the U.S. corporate results have been good and that’s
a good sign for the global economy,” said Vikas Babu, a
currency trader at  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai. “Capital flows have
been strong and that’s the main support for the rupee.”  The Indian currency strengthened 0.2 percent to 44.44 per
dollar as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That bolstered the rupee’s gain this
month to 0.3 percent, still the third-worst performance among
the 10 most-traded Asian currencies excluding the yen.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.19 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.25
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
