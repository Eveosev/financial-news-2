Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
largest producer of the metal, reported first-quarter profit
that topped analysts’ estimates by 1 cent after gold and copper
prices climbed.  Net income rose 22 percent to $1 billion, or $1 a share,
from $820 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier, Toronto-based
Barrick said today in a statement. Earnings adjusted for items
including an acquisition-related charge and a gain on
derivatives were $1.01 a share, beating the $1 average estimate
of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Gold prices rose to a record $1,518.32 an ounce in London
trading on April 25 as investors bought the metal as a hedge
against potential defaults on government debt while emerging-
market demand rose. Gold averaged $1,388 in the quarter, up 25
percent from a year earlier. Barrick also mines copper, which
increased to a record in the quarter.  Barrick, which said April 25 it agreed to acquire
Australian copper producer  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN)  for about C$7.3
billion ($7.7 billion), saw gold first-quarter production drop
to 1.96 million ounces from 2.06 million ounces a year earlier.
So-called total cash production costs rose to $437 an ounce from
$392.  Barrick advanced 65 cents to $50.84 as of 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares dropped 9.8
percent in the previous two trading sessions following the
Equinox deal.  ‘Ahead of Plan’  The earnings “should help Barrick stabilize and recover
from its $5 billion market-cap loss in the past two days,”
 George Topping , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus in Toronto who has
a “hold” recommendation on the shares, said in a telephone
interview. “They’re now cheap relative to their peers.”  Gold production and cash costs were “ahead of plan,”
primarily because of increased output from the Cortez,
Goldstrike and Veladero mines, Barrick said. Cortez produced
366,000 ounces, more than expected, and its full-year output is
scheduled to be more than 1.3 million ounces, Chief Executive
Officer Aaron Regent said in the statement.  Sales climbed 20 percent to $3.09 billion from $2.58
billion. The average estimate of eight analysts in a Bloomberg
survey was for $3.13 billion.  Barrick’s 2011 production will be 7.6 million ounces to 8
million ounces at total cash costs of $450 to $480 an ounce, the
company said, maintaining its forecast from February.  Production Goal  Today the company also reaffirmed its goal to produce 9
million ounces of gold annually within five years and said it
would increase the 2011 exploration budget by more than 50
percent compared with last year to $320 million to $340 million.
 North America , the Australia-Pacific region and  South America 
are to receive 43 percent, 24 percent and 15 percent of the
budget, respectively.  “We characterize the first quarter as operationally
strong,” Stephen Butler, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc.
in Toronto, said in a note.  The company is set to “comfortably” attain its forecast
production for this year, said Butler, who has a “buy” rating
on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
