Fighting erupted in the Abobo
neighborhood of  Ivory Coast ’s commercial capital, Abidjan, as
forces loyal to President  Alassane Ouattara  attempted to oust a
militia leader that controls the area.  “I saw a convoy of about 30 pick-up trucks with heavily
armed men drive into Abobo,” said resident Yakamoko Yeo by phone
today. “Since then, I can hear the sound of automatic gunfire
and rocket launchers.”  The Republican Forces that support Ouattara are battling
fighters loyal to Ibrahim Coulibaly, nicknamed “IB” by local
media and residents. Coulibaly heads the so-called “invisible
commando” militia that took up arms against  Laurent Gbagbo , the
Ivorian ex-president who refused to cede power to Ouattara after
losing a November election.  Ouattara called on all fighters to lay down their arms
following a 10-day battle for Abidjan that ended when Gbagbo was
captured on April 11.  Coulibaly didn’t attend a meeting of Ouattara’s defense
advisers yesterday, sending a delegation in his place, Abidjan-
based Nord-Sud newspaper reported, citing General Michel Gueu.
The delegation was told that Coulibaly should lay down arms, the
newspaper cited Gueu as saying.  Meite Sindou, spokesman for Prime Minister and Defense
Minister  Guillaume Soro , didn’t answer his phone when called
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
