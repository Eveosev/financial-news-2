U.S. nuclear-power output was
little changed as reactors adjusted production amid seasonal
refueling, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  said.  Power generation nationwide decreased 11 megawatts from
yesterday to 72,888 megawatts, or 72 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-six of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  slowed output from the 1,120-megawatt LaSalle
2 reactor in Illinois to 80 percent of capacity from full power
yesterday. The 1,118-megawatt LaSalle 1 unit is operating at
full capacity at the site, 70 miles (113 kilometers) southwest
of Chicago.  Exelon increased output from the 1,164-megawatt  Byron 1
reactor  in Illinois to 80 percent of capacity from 65 percent
yesterday after a refueling outage. Another unit at the site,
the 1,136-megawatt Byron 2, is operating at full power. The
plant is located 85 miles west of  Chicago .  Energy Future boosted the 1,150-megawatt Comanche Peak 2 to
46 percent of capacity from 1 percent yesterday. The 1,200-
megawatt Comanche Peak Unit 1 is producing at full power. The
plant is 66 miles southwest of Dallas.  Constellation Nuclear Energy Group LLC, a joint venture of
 Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG)  and Electricite de France SA,
slowed the 621-megawatt Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in  New York  to 46
percent of capacity from 78 percent yesterday for repairs on one
of three pumps that supply water to the reactor core, Jill Lyon,
a spokeswoman for the plant, said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  Another unit at the site, the 1,140-megawatt Unit 2, is at
full power. The plant is 6 miles northeast of Oswego.  Vermont  Yankee  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  boosted output from the 620-megawatt Vermont
Yankee reactor to full power from 76 percent of capacity
yesterday. Output had been lowered at the request of the grid
operator, ISO New England, because of the loss of a power line,
Larry Smith, a spokesman for the plant, said in an e-mailed
response to questions.  The plant is in Vernon, in the southeast corner of Vermont,
80 miles northwest of  Boston .  Entergy slowed both units at the Arkansas Nuclear One plant
at the request of the  Little Rock  Transmission Operating Center
because a storm knocked out a 500-kilovolt line on April 25,
Donna Gregory, a spokeswoman for the plant, said by telephone.
The plant is expected to increase output after repairs are
completed in the next few days, Gregory said.  The 843-megawatt Unit 1 and the 995-megawatt Unit 2 each
dropped to 43 percent of capacity from full power on April 25.
The plant is located 65 miles northwest of Little Rock.  Prairie Island 1  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)  slowed the 551-megawatt Prairie Island 1
reactor in Minnesota to 90 percent of capacity from 96 percent
yesterday. The 545-megawatt Prairie Island 2, another reactor at
the site about 40 miles southeast of Minneapolis, is operating
at full power.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
