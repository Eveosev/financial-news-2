GDF Suez’s liquefied-natural-gas
terminal near Boston and  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) ’s Sabine Pass
terminal in Louisiana are scheduled to receive LNG cargoes,
according to vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  The tanker Maran Gas Coronis is to arrive in Boston
tomorrow, the data showed. The vessel can move as much as
145,700 cubic meters of LNG, or about 3.14 billion cubic feet of
gas, equivalent to 5 percent of estimated daily U.S. gas
production.  Another ship, Maersk Meridian, is to arrive at Sabine Pass
on May 2. The tanker can carry as much as 163,285 cubic meters
of LNG, or about 3.52 billion cubic feet of natural gas.  GDF Suez operates a terminal in Everett,  Massachusetts ,
which can send about 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day into the
regional pipeline network, according to  the company.  GDF’s
Neptune offshore LNG terminal, which consists of a buoy system,
is also near  Boston .  The Sabine Pass terminal can regasify and send out 4
billion cubic feet a day of natural gas to pipelines, making it
the biggest LNG terminal in  North America .  LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back to a gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
