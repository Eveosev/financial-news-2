(Corrects name of university in fourth paragraph.)  Temperatures will drop below
freezing twice next week in the upper Great Plains, where soil
temperatures in some areas are below normal at prime planting
time, said  Allen Motew , a meteorologist with  QT Information
Systems  in  Chicago .  Hard freezes are likely in  North Dakota  and South Dakota
and parts of Nebraska and eastern Colorado on May 1, he said.
The cold may spread to encompass northwestern  Iowa  and parts of
Wisconsin the next day.  “The effects of that is, it keeps the soil temperature
cold,” Motew said by telephone. “We’re running 10 degrees
Fahrenheit below normal for Iowa soil temperature. It is of
significance.”  Soybean plants that are exposed to 28 degrees (minus 2
Celsius) or colder for more than three hours have to be
replanted, according to Iowa State University. Corn won’t
germinate in soil below 50 degrees, according to the
university’s  agronomy extension  school.  Soil temperatures at a depth of 4 inches range from 46
degrees to 48 degrees across North and  South Dakota , Minnesota,
northern Nebraska and Iowa.  Ground temperatures are important because a late start to
planting may affect how much can be harvested. In northeastern
Iowa, for example, corn needs to be planted from April 12 to May
2 in order to reach a yield of 95 to 100 percent, according to
the university.  To contact the reporter on this story:
