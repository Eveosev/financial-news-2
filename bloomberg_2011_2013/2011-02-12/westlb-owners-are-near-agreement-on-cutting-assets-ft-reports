WestLB AG’s owners are close to
agreement on reducing the bank’s assets by about a third as part
of a plan that may be approved by the European Commission next
week, the Financial Times reported.  The accord will likely be followed by a gradual sale of
assets leading to a change of ownership, the FT said, citing
unidentified people familiar with the plans. WestLB is owned by
the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the
Rhineland and Westphalia-Lippe regional savings-bank
associations.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Nicholas Larkin  in  London  at
