  Barclays Plc  plans to link the
bonuses given to staff in its Barclays Capital unit to the
bank’s capital ratio,  Sky News  reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  In a posting on the news organization’s website, Sky’s City
Editor Mark Kleinman said that employees in Barclays’ investment
banking unit will lose part of their bonus if the bank’s tier-
one capital ratio goes below 7 percent. He said the plan has
already been approved by the market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Lumley  in London at
