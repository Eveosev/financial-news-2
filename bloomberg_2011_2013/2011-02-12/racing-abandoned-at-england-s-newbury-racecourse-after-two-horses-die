Racing was abandoned today at
Newbury Racecourse in southwest  England  following the death of
two horses prior to the first race.  Fenix Two and Marching Song died after collapsing in the
parade ring, a  statement  on Newbury’s website said, without
giving a reason. After the race was run, officials decided to
call off the day’s remaining six events.  “This is a very sad day and our thoughts are with all the
connections of the two horses who died,” Stephen Higgins, joint
managing director of Newbury, said in the statement. “Whilst
the causes of this incident are still unknown, for safety
reasons we unfortunately had to abandon as our only course of
action.”  The British Broadcasting Corp. reported on its website the
horses may have been electrocuted from underground cables. Wet
ground conditions could have contributed, the  BBC  said.  The broadcaster quoted Paul Barber, owner of race winner Al
Ferof, as saying the girl leading Marching Song around said she
felt a tingling and then the horse went down.  “They were getting the shocks off the grass not the
tarmac,” Barber said. “I’ve never seen anything quite like
that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
