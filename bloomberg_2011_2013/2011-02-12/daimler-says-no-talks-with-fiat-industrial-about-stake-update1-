  Daimler AG  said it’s not holding
talks with Fiat Industrial SpA about taking a possible stake in
the Italian company, denying a German magazine report.  “There are no talks whatsoever with Fiat,” Daimler
spokesman Heinz Gottwick said today by telephone. “These are
rumors that keep cropping up but there’s nothing to it.”  German magazine  Der Spiegel  reported today that Daimler is
preparing to take a stake in Fiat Industrial, the trucks and
tractors unit that was separated from  Fiat SpA  last month,
citing no one. A spokesman for Fiat declined to comment.  Turin-based Fiat, which runs Chrysler Group LLC, completed
a separation of its industrial division in January to focus on
carmaking. Daimler is the world’s largest maker of heavy trucks
and the No. 2 in luxury vehicles. Rumors of the Stuttgart,
Germany-based manufacturer taking over Fiat Industrial cropped
up during last September’s international trucks show.    Der Spiegel  reported that Daimler is not seeking to fully
acquire Fiat Industrial, though is interested in the Iveco
truckmaking unit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
