A permanent European mechanism to
help indebted euro-member states should have 500 billion euros
($676 billion) at its disposal,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing no
one.  European Commission plans call for the so-called European
Stabilization Mechanism to have a capital stock of 100 billion
euros and be modeled after the  International Monetary Fund , the
German magazine said. The commission is the European Unionâ€™s
executive arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
