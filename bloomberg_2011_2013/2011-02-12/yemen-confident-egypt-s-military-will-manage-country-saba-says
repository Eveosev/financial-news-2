  Yemen  is confident that Egypt’s
military council will manage the country to safety through its
current political crisis, the official  Saba News Agency  said,
citing an unidentified government official.  Yemen respects the choice and will of the Egyptian people,
the news service said, citing the official. The government hopes
that Egypt’s national leaders, politicians and youth will work
together to protect the country’s security, it said.  After 30 years of autocratic rule,  Hosni Mubarak  ceded
power yesterday to the Egyptian military.  To contact the reporter on this story:
