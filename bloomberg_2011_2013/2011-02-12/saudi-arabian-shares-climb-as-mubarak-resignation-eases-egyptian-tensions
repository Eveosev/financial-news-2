and OPEC raised its oil demand forecast.  Safco, a unit of Saudi Basic Industries Corp., soared to
the highest in more than two years. Mobile Telecommunications

the highest intraday level since Jan. 29, at 1:21 p.m. in
Riyadh. Yesterday, Egypt’s default risk dropped and the North
African country’s bonds rallied.  “The de-escalation in Egypt is improving investor
sentiment,” said Asim Bukhtiar, an equity analyst at Riyad
Capital in Riyadh. “Gains in North American and European
markets” are helping Saudi stocks, as well as signs that OPEC
won’t increase oil production in the near term, which should
support prices, he said.  Mubarak resigned and handed power to the military after
protesters occupied central Cairo for the past 18 days,
demanding an end to his 30-year reign. Stocks in the U.S. and
Europe advanced yesterday, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
climbing 0.6 percent and the Stoxx  Europe  600 gaining 0.4
percent.    Oil Prices   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raised
estimates on Feb. 10 for the amount of crude it will need to
produce this year and said prices don’t signal any supply
shortage. Crude for March delivery declined $1.15 to $85.58 a
barrel, the lowest settlement since Nov. 30. Oil closed at a
two-year high of $92.19 a barrel on Jan. 31. Saudi Arabia holds
about 20 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves.  Safco gained 2.6 percent to 191.25 riyals, the highest

Vectors Egypt Index ETF , an exchange-traded fund that holds
Egyptian shares, gained 4.5 percent in  New York . Egypt’s 5.75
percent dollar bond due 2020 rebounded, cutting the yield by 15

amid the protests. The country’s benchmark stock index lost 16
percent during the week that ended Jan. 27.  While the stock exchange is scheduled to open tomorrow,
“what happens today is very crucial for that decision,”
Finance Minister Samir Radwan said in a Bloomberg Television
interview yesterday, before Mubarak stepped down.  Egypt’s protests began Jan. 25, inspired by an uprising
that ousted Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on Jan.
14. Tunisia’s main equity index has lost 11 percent since Dec.
17, when Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor, set himself on fire,
spurring the revolt against Ben Ali’s 23-year rule.  Saudi Arabia’s exchange is the only Arab market open on
