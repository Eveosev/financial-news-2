  Deutsche Telekom AG  may face strikes
unless the telecommunications company agrees to raise workersâ€™
pay,  Focus  reported, citing a labor-union official.  Preparations for walkouts at the Bonn, Germany-based
company are under way, the magazine quoted Lothar Schroeder,
board member at the Ver.di labor union, as saying before wage
talks on Feb. 15. The union is seeking a 6.5 percent increase
for 105,000 workers, while Deutsche Telekom has yet to propose
an offer, Focus reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
