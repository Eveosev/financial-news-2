The Ethiopian government may take
over Petroliam Nasional Bhd.’s oil and gas holdings in the
Ogaden region rather than approving a sale to  SouthWest Energy
(H.K.) Ltd. , The Reporter said, citing an unidentified official
at the Mines Ministry.  Hong Kong-based SouthWest announced on Oct. 6 that it
purchased the oil and gas fields in the arid region where rebels
have been fighting the government for more than three decades.
In April 2007, the Ogaden National Liberation Front attacked an
exploration site operated by  China ’s Zhongyuan Petroleum
Exploration Bureau, killing nine Chinese workers and 65
Ethiopians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
