  Alitalia  SpA and  Meridiana Fly SpA 
are discussing a merger,  Il Messaggero  reported, without saying
how it got the information.  Talks have been in progress for a “few months,” the
newspaper said, adding that the airlines’ boards have yet to
make a decision about combining.  A merger may take place through a share swap and give the
Aga Khan, who controls Meridiana, between 5 percent and 7
percent of Alitalia, according to Messaggero. That would
correspond to a valuation of Meridiana of about 100 million
euros ($135 million), the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
