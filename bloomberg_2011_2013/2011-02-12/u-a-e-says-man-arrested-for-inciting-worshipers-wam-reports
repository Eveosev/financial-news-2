United Arab Emirates police arrested
a former school teacher on charges that he assaulted an Islamic
religious leader, stole a microphone from him and incited
worshippers, the state-run Emirates News Agency  reported  today,
citing an unidentified official at the Interior Ministry.  Hasan Mohammad al-Hammadi is being held at police
headquarters in Khor Fakkan and is allowed contacts with his
wife and lawyer, WAM said.  London-based  Amnesty International   said  in a Feb. 9
statement on its website that al-Hammadi was arrested for
allegedly expressing support for demonstrations in Egypt and
Tunisia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
