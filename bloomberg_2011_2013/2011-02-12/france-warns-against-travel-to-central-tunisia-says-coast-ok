France said it is still inadvisable
to travel to central  Tunisia , while security conditions in its
former colony have improved enough to lift a warning against
visiting the coast and the tourist island of Djerba.  The situation in Tunisia “has not fully stabilized,” the
French Foreign Ministry said today in a  statement  on its
website.  Tunisia has been gripped by unrest since a street vendor
set himself on fire on Dec. 17, setting off demonstrations that
led to the end of the 23-year-long rule of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
