  Rolls-Royce Group Plc  Chairman Simon Robertson told leading investors that he intends to step down by
the end of next year, Mark Kleinman said in his column in the
Financial Times, without saying where he got the information.  A formal search for a successor is likely to begin within a
year, said Kleinman, who is City editor of Sky News.  Rolls-Royce spokesman Josh Rosenstock and spokeswoman
Nicola de Doncker didnâ€™t respond to telephone calls seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Nicholas Larkin  in London at
