Chuck Tanner, who managed the
Pittsburgh Pirates to the 1979 World Series title, has died, the
Major League Baseball team said in a statement. He was 82.  The  Associated Press  said he died at home in New Castle,  Pennsylvania , after a long illness.  Tanner began his Major League career in 1955 with the
Milwaukee Braves where the left-hander hit a home run on the
first pitch of his first plate appearance. He played in the
majors for seven years and managed for 19 years.  “Chuck spent his life serving baseball in a variety of
roles, and I am particularly glad that in recent years he
returned to the Pirates, the club with which he will be forever
linked,” said MLB Commissioner Bud Selig in a statement.  Besides Pittsburgh, he managed the  Chicago White Sox ,  Oakland Athletics  and  Atlanta Braves  until 1988.  “While always upbeat, Chuck was a fierce competitor who
knew how to get his players’ attention and maximum effort,”
said Pirates’ President Frank Coonelly on the team’s website.  Tanner most recently served as senior adviser to Pirates
General Manager Neal Huntington.  “My early memories of the Pirates organization are of
Chuck’s teams, the way they played the game and the genuine
affection they seemed to have for each other,” Huntington
said. “This made an impression on me and never did I imagine
that I would have a chance to work with Chuck himself.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
