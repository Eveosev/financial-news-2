U.K. finances are in a “calamitous
position,” and middle-income earners are going to feel
increasingly pressured as the year progresses, Justice Secretary
Ken Clarke told the  Daily Telegraph .  The U.K. is in for a “long haul” before public finances
return to normal, the newspaper cited Clarke as saying in an
interview. Clarke was in charge of the country’s Treasury
between 1993 and 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Lumley  in  London  at
