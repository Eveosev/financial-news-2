The Arkansas Teacher Retirement
System sued  State Street Corp . over claims that the Boston-based
bank engaged in unfair and deceptive practices regarding foreign
exchange transactions.  The Arkansas pension fund, which seeks to represent other
State Street clients in a class-action lawsuit, said in a
complaint filed yesterday in  Boston  that State Street charges
inflated FX rates when buying foreign currency for its custodial
customers and deflated rates when selling.  The fund said State Street made as much as $500 million in
profits from unfair foreign exchange practices and it is asking
for three times the amount of damages it and members of the
purported class suffered for violations of  Massachusetts 
Consumer Protection Act.  California sued State Street in October 2009 to recover
what officials said were more than $200 million in illegal
overcharges owed to the state’s two largest pension funds for
foreign currency trading fees.  Last October, the state of  Washington  reached an $11.7
million settlement with State Street over the pricing of foreign
currency transactions.  “State Street is firmly committed to providing its clients
with quality service and transparency in meeting their FX
needs,” the company said today in an e-mailed statement. “We
will vigorously defend the allegations made in the complaint and
we stand by our business practices.”  The case is Arkansas Teacher Retirement System v. State
Street, 11-10230, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
