The Turkish Cypriot administration
could go bankrupt for not following protocols related to how
Turkish aid should be spent,  Hurriyet  newspaper cited Turkey’s
minister in charge of Cypriot affairs, Cemil Cicek, as saying.  Turkey paid 916 million liras ($576 million) in aid to the
self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 2010, of
which 450 million liras went to close its  budget deficit , the
Istanbul-based newspaper cited Cicek as saying in an interview.
Calls placed outside of regular office hours by Bloomberg News
to the northern Cypriot Foreign Ministry in Nicosia and to the
embassy in Ankara went unanswered.  The administration on the north of the island spends 84
percent of its budget on public workers’ salaries, Cicek said.
Kuzey Kibris Turk Havayollari, a government-run Turkish Cypriot
airline, went bankrupt last year after ignoring  Turkey ’s
warnings about accumulating debts, and the same thing could
happen to northern Cyprus itself, Cicek said.  Turkish aid to northern Cyprus should be used for the
purposes outlined in protocols between the two governments,
Cicek said. The only way to close a prosperity gap with the
Greek-run south is for funds given by Turkey to be used more
intelligently, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
