Abercrombie & Fitch’s flagship store
on Fifth Avenue in  New York  will be temporarily closed after a
two-alarm fire last night damaged the building.  The store at 720 Fifth Avenue has 34,000 square feet (3,158
square meters) of space, spokesman Eric Cerny said. He didn’t
say when the store would reopen. There was one minor injury, the
New York Fire Department said.  More than 25 units and 125 firefighters responded to the
blaze, which began about 11 p.m. local time last night. It was
extinguished shortly after midnight, said Frank Dwyer, a fire
department spokesman.  The fire was on the fifth floor of the building, Dwyer
said. Although he didn’t know the full extent of the damage, he
said an hour-long fire “can cause a great deal of fire, smoke
and water damage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
