Konkola Copper Mines Plc, a unit of  Vedanta Resources Plc , plans to spend as much as $50 million on
environmental projects in  Zambia  this year, Corporate Affairs
Manager Jacqueline Kabeta said.  The projects are aimed at making its Nchanga mine in
Zambia’s Copperbelt region “more environmentally compliant,”
Kabeta said today in an e-mailed statement from Lusaka, the
capital.  Konkola, the largest mining and metals company in Zambia,
produces about 200,000 metric tons of copper a year and operates
the Nampundwe pyrite mine and Nkana copper refinery. Vedanta,
based in London, owns 51 percent of Konkola.  Zambia, Africa’s largest copper producer, plans to boost
output to more than 740,000 tons this year, according to Finance
and National Planning Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
