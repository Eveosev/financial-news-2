  Saudi Arabia , the Arab worldâ€™s
biggest economy, signed contracts worth 334 million riyals ($89
million) to develop tourism projects as the kingdom tries to
attract more visitors, the official  Saudi Press Agency  said.  The contracts include building five new regional museums
and restoring historical sites, the news service said, citing
Ahmed Bin Abdullah al-Shehri, director of procurement and
contract management at the  Saudi Commission for Tourism &
Antiquities . The museums will be in Dammam, Hail, Tabuk, Asir
and al-Baha, the news service said.  Saudi Arabia plans to have 2 million tourism jobs within 10
years, up from 457,000, as it promotes its Red Sea coastline and
historical sites, including  Madain Saleh , as tourist
destinations, according to the commission. Tourism revenue is
forecast to increase to 118 billion riyals in 2015, compared
with 66 billion riyals last year, the Saudi Press Agency
reported in June.  Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, wants to develop its  tourism industry  as it tries to diversify its economy away from
oil and to create jobs. The  unemployment rate  is as high as 43
percent for Saudis between the ages of 20 and 24.  Saudi Arabia announced in November that it discovered a
Pharaonic inscription in its northwest province of Tabuk. The
artifact had a hieroglyphic inscription of a signature from
Ramses III, a king who ruled ancient  Egypt  between about 1192 BC
and 1160 BC.  Saudi Arabia received 1.8 million visitors last year from
181 countries for the annual pilgrimage, or hajj, to Mecca,
according to the Saudi Press Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
