Federal prosecutors are seeking to
drop charges against accused Tucson, Arizona, shooter Jared Lee
Loughner for the murders of Chief U.S. District Judge John Roll
and Gabriel Zimmerman, an aide to Representative  Gabrielle
Giffords , according to court papers filed yesterday.  Arizona U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke said the charges should
be dropped “without prejudice to the government to seek
indictment of these charges at a later date.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
