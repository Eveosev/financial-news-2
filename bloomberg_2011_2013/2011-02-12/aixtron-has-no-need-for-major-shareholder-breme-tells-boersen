Aixtron SE has no need for a major
stockholder,  Boersen-Zeitung  cited Chief Financial Officer
Wolfgang Breme as saying.  “We don’t need protectors,” Breme said in an interview
with the German newspaper when asked whether Aixtron prefers to
have an anchor shareholder given its equity free float of about
92 percent. The free float is the portion of a company’s stock
that is available to be traded freely.  To contact the reporter on this story:
