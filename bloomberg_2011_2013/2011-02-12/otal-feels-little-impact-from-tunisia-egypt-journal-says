  Total SA  has felt “little” impact
from regime changes in Tunisia and Egypt and is more concerned
about political unrest in Ivory Coast,  Journal du Dimanche 
reported.  Events in Tunisia and Egypt “have had little economic
consequences for us so far,” the French newspaper cited Chief
Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie as saying in an
interview. “But we remain attentive.”  The price of a barrel of oil will remain high because of a
production shortage and rising demand in countries such as
China, the CEO said, according to the newspaper. Paris-based
Total is the third-biggest European oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
