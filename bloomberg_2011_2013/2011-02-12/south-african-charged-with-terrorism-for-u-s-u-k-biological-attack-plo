South African police arrested a 64-
year-old man on terrorism charges after he allegedly threatened
to release biological agents in the U.K. and the U.S.  “The suspect repeatedly, through letters and e-mails,
demanded an amount of $4 million in exchange for not deploying a
biological agent within the borders of the  United Kingdom ,” the
South African Police Service said in a  statement  on its website.
“A similar threat was also made against the  United States .”  The South African businessman was arrested in a sting
operation after a six-month investigation carried out in
collaboration with the  London Metropolitan Police Counter
Terrorism Command  and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation,
according to the police.  “He was caught red-handed while he was picking up the
ransom,” police spokeswoman Brigadier Sally de Beer said in a
mobile-phone interview. “He was loading the five containers he
requested in negotiations.”  The suspect will appear in court on Feb. 14 on charges
relating to terrorism, according to the police. The arrest was
confirmed by the London Metropolitan Police in an e-mailed
statement today.  “This biological agent, if deployed, would have caused the
destruction of property and resulted in major economic loss,”
the South African police statement said, adding that the threat
was “very serious.”  “Various crime scenes associated with this operation are
still being dealt with and certain aspects of the investigation
still need to be completed,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
