Algerian authorities detained 100
people today during a peaceful sit-in in the capital inspired by
pro-democracy protests in Egypt and  Tunisia , Mustapha Bouchachi,
head of the League for the Defense of Human Rights, said.  “This is evidence that the authorities don’t accept
peaceful demonstrations,” Bouchachi said in an interview at the
protest in Algiers. “2011 will be a year for change. This is
the first attempt.”  President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced Feb. 3 that the
government would lift the North African country’s 19-year-old
state of emergency “in the very near future,” state-run
Algeria Presse Service said. He also said demonstrations, banned
under the state of emergency, would be permitted across Algeria,
except in the capital.  The lifting of the state of emergency has been a rallying
point for protesters who staged demonstrations across  Algeria 
last month. The measure was imposed after the cancellation of
the country’s first multiparty elections that Islamists were set
to win in 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
