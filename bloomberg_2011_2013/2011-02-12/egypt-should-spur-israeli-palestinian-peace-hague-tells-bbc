U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
said the resignation of  Hosni Mubarak  as Egypt’s president
should prompt Israelis and Palestinians to try harder to find a
peace settlement.  “Perhaps one of the good things that might come from
events in Egypt and Tunisia is that policymakers in Israel and
among Palestinians will be jolted to see that it is vital now to
take this forward, because in a few years time a two-state
solution will be much, much more difficult to achieve,” Hague
told the British Broadcasting Corp.’s  Radio 4 ’s Today program.  People should not fear the rise of democracy in the Arab
world, Hague told the program, acknowledging that the recent
events in North Africa may complicate the search for a peace
deal between Israelis and Palestinians.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Nicholas Larkin  in London at
