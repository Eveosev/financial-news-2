Ireland’s  Cork airport  re-opened
following a crash by a small commuter aircraft on Feb. 10 that
killed six people.  Normal service has resumed, the airport, located in the
south of the country, said today in a statement on its website.
Passengers should check directly with airlines before traveling
to the airport, it said.  The Manx2 airline flight crashed on approach following two
failed attempts, and wasn’t in view of the air-traffic control
tower because of poor visibility due to fog, Irish Aviation
Authority Chief Executive Officer Eamon Brennan said on Feb. 10.
One of the dead was a relative of Ireland President Mary McAleese.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Nicholas Larkin  in  London  at
