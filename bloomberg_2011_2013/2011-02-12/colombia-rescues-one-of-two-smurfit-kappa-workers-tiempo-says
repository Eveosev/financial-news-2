Colombia’s army today rescued one of
two  Smurfit Kappa Group Plc  workers who had been kidnapped Feb.
9 by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,  El Tiempo daily
said , citing General Edgar Cely, head of the nation’s armed
forces.  The kidnapping by the country’s biggest guerrilla group,
known as FARC, came on the day the rebels handed over one of the
five hostages scheduled to be released this week.  President Juan Manuel Santos said Feb. 10 he “rejected the
FARC’s double standards” and that he had been “tempted” to
suspend the liberation process because of the kidnappings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
