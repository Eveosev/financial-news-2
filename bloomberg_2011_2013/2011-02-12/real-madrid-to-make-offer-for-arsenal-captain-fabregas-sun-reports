Real Madrid will make a 54 million-
pound ($86 million) move to sign Arsenal midfielder Cesc
Fabregas in the summer transfer period, the Sun reported.  Real hopes to tempt Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  into
selling his captain by offering striker Karim Benzema or
attacking midfielder Sergio Canales as part of a deal, the Sun
said.  Fabregas, 23, last summer came close to joining Barcelona,
from which he joined Arsenal as a 16-year-old. Barcelona last
week said it could no longer afford him, leaving the door open
for Real and Chelsea, which is also ready to match the British
record 50 million pounds it recently paid to Liverpool for  Fernando Torres , the Sun said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
