  France  hopes Egypt can maintain the
major role it has always exercised regarding stability in the
Middle East after the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak,
French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said.  France has “never been more by the side of Egyptians in
this new phase of their history,” Fillon said today on board
the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle in the Red Sea. Fillon’s
speech to the French armed forces was reported in a statement
from his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
