Controlling shareholders of  Telemar
Norte Leste SA ,  Brazil ’s phone company known as Oi, are seeking
a successor to Chief Executive Officer Luiz Eduardo Falco, whose
contract won’t be renewed when it ends in November,  Veja
magazine  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Russell Reynolds Associates has been hired to lead the
search, Veja said in its Holofote column.  Oi declined to comment to Bloomberg News, according to a
corporate communications official, who asked not to be
identified because of company policy. FSB Comunicacoes, the
press-relations firm that represents Oi controlling
shareholders, didn’t immediately respond to a telephone message
left by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
