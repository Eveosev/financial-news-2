TNK-BP’s Russian billionaire
shareholders will likely demand at a board meeting next week
that the venture participate in  BP Plc ’s planned alliance with
OAO Rosneft, the Financial Times reported.  The move could force a vote on the issue as early as Feb.
18, when the TNK-BP board is due to meet, the FT said, citing an
unidentified person close to TNK-BP. BP and Stan Polovets, the
chief executive officer of AAR, the group representing the
Russian billionaire shareholders, declined to comment, the FT
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Nicholas Larkin  in London at
