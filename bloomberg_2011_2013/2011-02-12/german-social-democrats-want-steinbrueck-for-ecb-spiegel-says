  Germany ’s opposition Social
Democrats want former Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck to run
for the position of the next president of the  European Central
Bank ,  Spiegel Online  reported.  Steinbrueck, 64, who served as finance minister during
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first term from 2005 to 2009, should
be considered if Merkel, a Christian Democrat, still wants a
German candidate for the ECB’s top job, the magazine said,
citing the Social Democrats’ parliamentary leader, Frank-Walter Steinmeier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
