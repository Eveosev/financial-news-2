Portugal and  Mozambique  will create
a company this year that will build locomotives and rail wagons
to be used to transport coal from the northwestern province of
Tete, state-controlled  Radio Mozambique  reported, citing
Transport and Communications Minister Paulo Zucula.  The southern African country will need more than 600 wagons
in the next five years, the Maputo-based broadcaster cited
Zucula as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
