Ugandan opponents to President
Yoweri Museveni are threatening protests similar to those in  Egypt  if elections scheduled for next week are manipulated, the  Associated Press  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Museveni, in power for 25 years, faces seven opponents in
the elections, only the second multiparty vote in 30 years, AP
said. Opposition candidate Kizza Besigye said the vote will be
flawed because the electoral commission favors Museveni, AP
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Nicholas Larkin  in  London  at
