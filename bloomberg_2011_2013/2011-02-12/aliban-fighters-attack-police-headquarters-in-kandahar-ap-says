Taliban fighters attacked the
provincial police headquarters in the southern Afghanistan
province of Kandahar, killing at least one person, the  Associated Press  reported.  Police surrounded several fighters occupying a building
across the street from the headquarters, AP said, citing Zalmai
Ayubi, a spokesman for the provincial governor of Kandahar. A
street battle ensued after the insurgents fired rocket-propelled
grenades, leaving 26 wounded, the news agency said. The Taliban
claimed responsibility, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Nicholas Larkin  in  London  at
