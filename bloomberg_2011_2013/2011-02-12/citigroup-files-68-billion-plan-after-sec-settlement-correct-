(Corrects Feb. 11 story to indicate filing isn’t part of
settlement.)    Citigroup Inc ., the third-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, may issue as much as $68 billion of stock,
bonds and other securities over the next three years, according
to a filing triggered as a result of a settlement with
regulators.  The bank, based in  New York , registered the securities for
review by the Securities and Exchange Commission in today’s
filing. Under SEC rules, companies lose their ability to
register securities without review if they’ve been accused of
certain violations within the prior three years. Citigroup lost
that privilege as the result of a settlement with the SEC last
year,  Shannon Bell , a bank spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Citigroup settled claims that it failed to disclose to
investors $40 billion in subprime-related holdings. The bank,
led by Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit , agreed to pay a
$75 million fine. As a result of the settlement, the bank will
no longer be termed a “well-known seasoned issuer” that can
register securities without review.  “Citi is filing amendments to previously filed
registration statements and will file new registration
statements to cover expected issuances for the next three years,
to conform with SEC guidance,” Bell said. “Citi does not
expect that its SEC filing status will affect its current
issuance programs.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
