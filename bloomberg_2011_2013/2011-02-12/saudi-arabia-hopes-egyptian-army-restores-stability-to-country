  Saudi Arabia  welcomes the transition
of power in  Egypt  and hopes that the army restores peace to the
Arab world’s most populous country, the official Saudi Press
Agency reported.  The kingdom hopes stability returns to Egypt in preparation
for a government that fulfills the “aspirations” of its people
and allows for economic prosperity, the  news service  said,
citing an unidentified government official.  Although Saudi Arabian citizens haven’t been protesting on
the streets since demonstrations erupted in Egypt on Jan. 25,
the Saudi government expressed concern about the events
unfolding across the Middle East. Violence in Tunisia has
persisted since President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was ousted on
Jan. 14.  A day before President  Hosni Mubarak  ceded power to the
military, ending his 30-year autocratic rule, the Saudi Press
Agency said Saudi Arabia denounced the “flagrant interference
of some countries” in the internal affairs of Egypt, citing
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal.  Saudi  King Abdullah  said Jan. 29 that “some infiltrators,
in the name of freedom of expression, have infiltrated into the
brotherly people of Egypt, to destabilize its security and
stability,” according to the Saudi Press Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
