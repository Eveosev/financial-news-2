  Turkey  urged the Egyptian military
to transfer power through free and fair elections “as soon as
possible.”  “Turkey has supported the legitimate demands for democracy
and freedom of the brotherly people of  Egypt  from the very
outset of the mass demonstrations,” Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s office said in a  statement  late yesterday. “The
international community should mobilize its full efforts to
prevent Egypt from confronting economic hardships or any other
negative consequences.”  The announcement was released after Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  ceded power to the armed forces, ending his 30-
year rule. The popular revolt that toppled him was a historic
development for Egypt, its people and the Middle East, Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey’s foreign minister, said in a separate
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
