Chris Ashton scored a record four
tries as  England  beat Italy 59-13 in rugby’s Six Nations.  Mark Cueto, Mike Tindall, Danny Care and James Haskell also
touched down as England outscored Italy eight tries to one at
Twickenham Stadium in  London . Ashton is the first England player
to score four tries in a Six Nations match.  “He’s a finisher, lots of good stuff today,” England
coach Martin Johnson told the British Broadcasting Corp. “We
wanted to do what we did today and that was go out there,
execute and put them away as fast as we could.”  England’s second consecutive win leaves it atop the
standings with four points.  Wales  beat Scotland 24-6 in
Edinburgh for its first win as Shane Williams scored two tries.  Defending champ France visits Ireland tomorrow in a matchup
of the past two Six Nations winners.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
