Jordan Taylor scored 27 points for
the  University of Wisconsin , giving the Badgers a 71-67 Big Ten
Conference victory and handing top-ranked  Ohio State University 
its first defeat of the college basketball season.  Wisconsin (19-5, 9-3) was behind 47-32 seven minutes into
the second half when the 14th-ranked Badgers went on a 15-0 run
to tie the game. Taylor scored 21 of his 27 points in the second
half at Kohl Center in Madison, Wisconsin.  Taylor “made all the difference in the world,” said
teammate Jon Leuer. “He came down and hit those back-to-back 3s
and got us right back into it, and from there you could just see
we had some momentum. It was unbelievable what he was able to do
in such a short period of time.”  Leuer and Mike Bruesewitz each added 12 points for  Wisconsin  and John Gasser had 11.  The Buckeyes (24-1, 11-1), who had a 28-26 lead at
halftime, were led by William Buford with 21 points and Jared
Sullinger with 19 points and 12 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
