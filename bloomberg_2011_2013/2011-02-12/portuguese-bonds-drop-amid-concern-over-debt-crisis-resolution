Portuguese bonds fell, driving
yields to the highest since 1999, after European Union officials
failed to agree on expanding financial aid to the most indebted
countries at a summit last weekend.  Greek debt led declines for the week in  government
securities  from the euro region’s high-deficit countries. Yields
on Greek 10-year bonds rose to the highest since Jan. 28.
European leaders met in Brussels last weekend to focus on ways
to reinforce the 440-billion euro ($596 billion) European
Financial Security Facility, reduce rates on emergency aid and
set up a permanent rescue mechanism. German two-year notes
gained for the first week this year as concern over unrest that
saw Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  relinquish power spurred
demand for the safest assets.  “There’s still disappointment at the lack of constructive
information on the EFSF,” said Eric Wand, an interest-rate
strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London.
“Portuguese 10-year yields breaking north of 7 percent in
outright terms hasn’t helped sentiment. With yields above 7
percent, people get worried about the debt-sustainability
argument.”  The yield on the Portuguese 10-year bond rose 25 basis
points in the week to 7.31 percent at 5:01 p.m. in  London 
yesterday. It climbed to 7.64 percent on Feb. 10, the most since
the euro’s introduction in 1999. The price of the 4.8 percent
securities maturing in June 2020 dropped 1.50, or 15 euros per
1,000 euro face amount, to 83.40.  The difference in yield between the Portuguese securities
and benchmark German bunds widened 22 basis points to 4.02
percentage points.  Greek Bonds  Portuguese bonds pared their drop amid reports the  European
Central Bank  purchased securities though the Securities Market
Program. The purchases were made on Feb. 10, according to three
people with knowledge of the transactions. They declined to be
identified because the deals are confidential. An ECB spokesman
in  Frankfurt  declined to comment.  Greek 10-year bonds also fell, with the yield climbing 57
basis points to 11.52 percent. The yield on Irish bonds of a
similar maturity rose 21 basis points to 9.09 percent. The
Italian yield gained 17 basis points to 4.78 percent, while the
10-year Spanish yield increased 23 basis points to 5.38 percent.  German  government bonds  have lost investors 2.2 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek
securities returned 4.6 percent, Spanish debt gained 1.4 percent
and Irish bonds earned 0.3 percent, the indexes showed, amid
growing confidence that French and German policy makers will
resolve differences over the EFSF.  Investor Confidence  German two-year note yields dropped by three basis points
this week to 1.41 percent amid protests that led to Mubarak
resigning yesterday and handing power to the military.  The yield on German 10-year bunds,  Europe ’s benchmark
government debt securities, rose three basis points to 3.29
percent this week. It reached 3.32 percent on Feb. 9, the
highest since Jan. 14, 2010.  Investor confidence in the so-called peripheral economies
may be tested next week as  Spain  and Italy auction debt.  The Italian government plans to sell as much as 3.5 billion
euros of debt due 2015 and 1.75 billion euros of bonds maturing
in 2040 on Feb. 14. Spain is scheduled to auction securities due
in 2020 and 2037 on Feb. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
