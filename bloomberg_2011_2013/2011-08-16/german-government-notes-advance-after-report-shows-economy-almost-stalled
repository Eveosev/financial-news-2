German two-year notes opened higher
as a report showed  Germany â€™s economy, the largest in Europe,
almost stalled in the second quarter.  The yield slipped six basis points to 0.65 percent as of
7:12 a.m. in  London , while that on the 10-year bund decreased
three basis points to 2.30 percent.   German gross domestic product, adjusted for seasonal
effects, rose 0.1 percent from the first quarter, when it jumped
a revised 1.3 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today. Economists had forecast growth of 0.5
percent, according to the median of 33 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
