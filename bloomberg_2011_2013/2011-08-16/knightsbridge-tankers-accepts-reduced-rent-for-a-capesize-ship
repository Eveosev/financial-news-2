Knightsbridge Tankers Ltd. (VLCCF) , an owner
of tankers and dry-bulk carriers, accepted reduced hire payments
for one of its capesize ships.  The reduction took effect July 1 and will last a year, the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said today in a statement. The
charterers will repay the amount owed starting next July 1 over
the remaining period of the original charter, which expires in
September 2014, Knightsbridge said.  The Golden Zhejiang, with a capacity of 176,000 deadweight
tons, was chartered for four years until September 2014 at a
daily rate of $28,405, according to  filings  with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission by the vesselâ€™s previous
owner, Golden Ocean Group Ltd.  Knightsbridge also said second-quarter net income fell 46
percent to $7.18 million, or 30 cents a share, from $13.4
million, or 79 cents, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 13 percent
to $22.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
