Foreign direct investment  in China
rose 19.8 percent in July to $8.3 billion from a year earlier,
stoking the expansion of the fastest-growing major economy.  For the first seven months of the year, the increase was
18.6 percent to $69.2 billion, the  Ministry of Commerce  said in
a statement in Beijing today.  China’s sustained growth and expanding consumer market have
encouraged companies including Nissan Motor Co. and McDonald’s
Corp. to boost their presence. Nissan’s Chinese venture said
July 26 that it plans to invest 50 billion yuan ($7.8 billion)
by 2015 to gain share in the world’s largest auto market.  “The weakening global recovery and turbulent financial
market will make China an even more attractive place for
investors to park their money,” Fang Sihai, a Beijing-based
chief economist at Hongyuan Securities Co., said before today’s
announcement. “The  China  story will remain appealing for many
years to come.”  The world’s second-biggest economy may expand more than 9
percent this year, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. That compares with
International Monetary Fund projections in June of 2.5 percent
growth in the U.S. and a 2 percent expansion in the euro area.  McDonald’s Corp., the world’s largest restaurant chain,
says it aims to open an outlet a day in China over the next
three to four years.  --Zheng Lifei. Editors: Paul Panckhurst, Ken McCallum  To contact the reporter on this story:
