Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038) 
surged by the most in 20 months in  Hong Kong  trading on
speculation its sales to Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. may
rise after the U.S. company is sold to  Google Inc. (GOOG)   Foxconn, a handset maker that supplies Motorola, surged as
much as 17 percent to HK$4.02, the biggest intraday gain since
December 2009, before trading 14 percent higher at HK$3.90 at
11:15 a.m. in Hong Kong.  Google, the biggest maker of smartphone software, agreed to
buy Motorola Mobility Holdings for $12.5 billion in its largest
acquisition, gaining mobile patents and expanding in the
hardware business. Motorola, after pioneering mobile-phone
technology in the 1980s and 1990s, fell to 2.4 percent of the
market last year, from 21.9 percent in the second quarter of
2006, according to researcher Gartner Inc.  “Motorola’s performance has been weak, but this Google
deal raises hopes for Motorola’s sales and therefore its parts
suppliers,” Baek Jong Suk, a Seoul-based analyst with Hyundai
Securities Co., said by phone today.  In  Seoul , ELK Corp. and Interflex Co., which also supply
parts to Motorola, surged by the daily limit. ELK, a touch panel
maker, jumped 15 percent to 12,150 won on the Korea Exchange,
set for its biggest gain since January 2010. Interflex, which
manufactures flexible printed circuit boards, climbed 15 percent
to 21,600 won. In Taipei,  Compal Communications Inc. (8078)  climbed 7
percent to NT$32.15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
