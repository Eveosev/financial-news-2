Support for joint euro-area bonds is

Democratic Party,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing lawmakers.  The newspaper quoted CDU lawmaker Armin Laschet as calling
for an “open discussion” toward a broad solution to the debt
crisis, of which eurobonds could be a part. Handelsblatt also
reported the CDU members of the European Parliament have
circulated an 11-page document listing the reasons in favor of
eurobonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
