China ’s yuan advanced to a 17-year
high after the central bank fixed the currency stronger for a
fifth day amid speculation gains will be tolerated to contain
inflation.  Conditions are ripe for China to appropriately expand the
yuan’s trading band against the dollar, the China Securities
Journal wrote today in a front-page editorial. The currency has
advanced 0.8 percent in August as inflation accelerated to its
fastest pace in three years and China’s trade surplus widened.
The People’s Bank of China set the reference rate 0.04 percent
stronger at a record 6.3925 per dollar.  “The trend is for more yuan gains going forward,” said
 Brian Jackson , a senior strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
 Hong Kong . “There’s an incentive to move more on the currency
to get inflation lower. Exports so far have been holding up
pretty well.”  The yuan rose 0.05 percent to 6.3870 per dollar as of 10:34
a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. That’s the strongest level since the country unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993. In Hong
Kong’s offshore market, the yuan appreciated 0.08 percent to
6.3725.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.2706 per dollar as of 10:33 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. They reached 6.2585 earlier, the
strongest level since March 2008. The premium to the onshore
spot rate was 1.9 percent, up from a two-year low of 0.4 percent
on Aug. 9.  Widening the Band  Widening the trading band and increasing the flexibility of
the yuan’s exchange rate will help damp one-way appreciation
expectations and effectively block capital inflows, according to
the editorial. The yuan is currently allowed to trade up to 0.5
percent on either side of the daily  reference rate  set by the
central bank. The band was last expanded on May 18, 2007, from
0.3 percent.  Consumer prices increased 6.5 percent from a year earlier
in July, the most since June 2008, the statistics bureau
reported on Aug. 9. China had a trade surplus of $31.5 billion
last month, the most since January 2009, the government said on
Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
