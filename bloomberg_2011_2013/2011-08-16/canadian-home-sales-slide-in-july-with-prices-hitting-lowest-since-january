Canadian existing-home sales fell in
July and the average price declined to its lowest in six months,
the  Canadian Real Estate Association  said  in a statement  today.  Purchases dropped 0.1 percent to 37,492 units on a
seasonally adjusted basis after climbing 2.6 percent in June,
the association said. Compared with the same month a year
earlier, sales rose 12.3 percent in July.  Canada ’s real estate market has stayed strong since 2009,
with buyers taking advantage of historically low  interest rates 
and available credit from banks that largely escaped the
financial crisis. Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said in a
June 15  speech  that  home prices  in some parts of the country are
reaching “severely unaffordable” levels.  The average price was C$361,181 ($366,998) in July on an
unadjusted basis, the lowest since January, according to the
association, which represents more than 100,000 realtors. Prices
are 9.3 percent higher than a year earlier.  While the average price reflected homes in some expensive
neighborhoods of  Vancouver , “this factor is now diminishing,”
the realtor group’s chief economist, Gregory Klump, said in a
statement.  ‘Stark Contrast’  “The national share of sales activity in some of Canada’s
more expensive urban centers may retreat further from elevated
levels recorded earlier this year, resulting in an easing trend
for the national average home price,” Klump said. “Even so,
the stability of Canada’s housing market will likely continue to
stand in stark contrast to further expected volatility in
financial markets.”  Among Canada’s major cities, sales rose in Montreal,
Calgary and Edmonton. Purchases slid 0.8 percent Toronto and
fell 3.2 percent in Vancouver compared with June.  The group also raised its forecast for both sales and
prices for 2011 while lowering its projection for 2012 as a
result of an “erosion in affordability” due to higher prices,
the association said.  The association expects national sales to reach 450,800
this year, up less than 1 percent from 2010. The group had
previously forecast a decline in purchases of about one percent
in 2011. CREA forecasts that the average national price will
rise 7.2 percent this year to C$363,500.  The association forecasts sales to drop 0.7 percent next
year, and projects the national price will increase marginally
to C$363,600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
