Zimbabwe’s former army chief,
Solomon Mujuru, died after a fire at his home, Simon Khaya Moyo,
chairman of the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front,
said by phone from Harare today.  The 62-year-old Mujuru was a top official in Zanu-PF, which
is led by President  Robert Mugabe , and the husband of Joice Mujuru, the country’s vice president.  Solomon Mujuru, also known as Rex Nhongo, left the military
in 1995 and became a major shareholder in the River Ranch
diamond mine. He was head of the guerrilla force that fought
against the southern African nation’s white government in the
1970s and then leader of Zimbabwe’s army after independence from
Britain in 1980. Mujuru and his wife were subject to travel and
business sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the European Union
against Mugabe and senior members of his party.  Mujuru’s death is a “blow to the Zanu-PF faction” led by
his wife as he was a powerful member of the party, Takavafira
Zhou, a political lecturer at the University of Masvingo in
southern  Zimbabwe , said by phone. “The power-broker is no
longer there.”  It may boost the chances of Emmerson Mnangagwa, the
minister of defense, succeeding the 87-year-old Mugabe as leader
of Zanu-PF, Zhou said. Mnangagwa and Joice Mujuru were seen as
likely successors to Mugabe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
