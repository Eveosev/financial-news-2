Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s state-owned
energy company, will give the go-ahead today for the
installation of the world’s first seabed gas-compressor, the
Financial Times reported, citing Margareth Ovrum, Statoil’s
executive vice president of technology and new energy.  The project, the cost of which is estimated at 15 billion
kroner ($2.7 billion) will enable Statoil to extract more gas
from its Asgard field in the North Sea and later from other
fields, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
