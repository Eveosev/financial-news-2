U.K. rail passengers face increases
in the prices of season tickets and long-distance off-peak
travel of 8 percent on average and as much as 13 percent in some
cases from Jan. 1 next year, the London-based Times reported.  The government has indicated that regulated fares will rise
by three percentage points above retail price inflation in each
of the next three years, compared with one point above RPI this
year; train operators are permitted to raise fares by a further
five points on some routes, provided their average increases
donâ€™t exceed RPI plus three points, the newspaper said.  Inflation figures to be announced today are likely to show
that retail prices rose at a rate of 5 percent a year in July,
the Times said.  Railway campaigners, including the Campaign for Better
Transport and the TSSA rail union are organizing protests
against the prospective increases today, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
