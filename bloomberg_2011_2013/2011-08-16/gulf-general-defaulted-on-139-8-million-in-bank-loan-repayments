Gulf General Investments Co., a
Dubai-based investment company, said it defaulted on the
repayment of 513.5 million dirhams ($139.8 million) in bank
loans as of June 30.  The company said in May that it had defaulted on the
repayment of 489.2 million dirhams as of March 30. “The
company’s initiation of restructuring the debt due to the banks
is in advanced progress,” it said in a statement to the Dubai
bourse yesterday.  “The non-current portion of the defaulted loans as at June
30 amounting to 438.8 million dirhams was reclassified in the
condensed consolidated financial statements as current
liabilities,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
