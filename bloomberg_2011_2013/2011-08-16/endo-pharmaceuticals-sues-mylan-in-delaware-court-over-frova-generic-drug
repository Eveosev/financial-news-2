Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. (ENDP) 
sued to stop Mylan Inc. from marketing a generic copy of Frova
before three patents on the migraine drug expire.  Mylan, based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, is seeking
approval to make and sell a version of the drug’s 2.5 milligram
tablets, Endo said in a complaint filed today in federal court
in Wilmington,  Delaware .  Endo, based in  Chadds Ford , Pennsylvania, asked a judge to
bar Mylan from infringing the patents. Frova, used to treat
acute migraines in adults, was Endo’s fifth-biggest seller last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Endo, which markets Frova in the U.S., received notice from
Mylan of an abbreviated new drug application last month,
according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The notice refers to five U.S. patents covering
Frova and expiring between 2013 and 2015.  Nina Devlin, a spokeswoman for Mylan, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment on the suit.  The case is Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Mylan
Pharmaceuticals Inc., U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
