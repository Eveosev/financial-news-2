The rebound in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index from an 11-month low may fail after an advance of
another 1.3 percent and investors should use gains to sell
weaker holdings, according to MKM Partners’  Katie Stockton .  The benchmark gauge’s advance may stop around 1,220, near
where it peaked in April 2010, Stockton said in a telephone
interview yesterday. The Greenwich, Connecticut-based chief
market technician at MKM said selling pressure and a global loss
of momentum will prevent U.S. stocks from moving higher in the
next few weeks. The S&P 500 gained 2.2 percent to close at
1,204.49 yesterday to cap a three-day rally of 7.5 percent, its
biggest since March 2009.  “People are looking to break even for those who bought
ahead of the breakdown,” she said. A “more impressive relief
rally” over the near term is expected to give investors the
chance to sell weak holdings, or any stocks that have fallen
below support levels, she said.  The  S&P 500  confirmed its “breakdown” last week after
falling below its March low of about 1,250, and that suggests
the index may retreat to near another support level at 1,100 in
the weeks ahead, Stockton wrote in the note.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study price
graphs to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  Unprecedented Swings  The swings in U.S. equities last week were unprecedented in
the history of the American stock market, according to data
compiled by Birinyi Associates Inc., Bloomberg and  Howard Silverblatt , senior index analyst at S&P. Silverblatt, senior
index analyst at S&P.  The S&P 500 plunged 6.7 percent on Aug. 8, its biggest
slump since December 2008, in the first trading session after
the U.S. was stripped of its AAA credit rating at S&P. The index
rebounded 4.7 percent the next day. It then fell 4.4 percent on
Aug. 10 and rebounded 4.6 percent the next day. Never before has
the index reversed moves that large each day over four sessions,
the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
