Rick Rypien, a center with the
 National Hockey League ’s Winnipeg Jets, was found dead in his
home. He was 27.  Rypien’s death in Alberta,  Canada , yesterday isn’t being
treated as suspicious, the  Associated Press  said, citing a Royal
Canadian Mounted Police official it didn’t identify.  “Rick was a talented player with an extremely bright
future,” the Jets said in a  statement  on their website. “His
hunger for the game made him a valued team member both on and
off the ice. This loss has impacted us as more than just a
hockey team.”  Rypien, the cousin of former National Football League
quarterback Mark Rypien, is the second NHL player to die during
the offseason.  New York Rangers  forward Derek Boogaard was found
dead at his Minneapolis home on May 12. The 28-year-old Boogaard
died from an accidental mix of alcohol and the painkiller
oxycodone, AP said.  Rypien spent six seasons with the  Vancouver Canucks  before
signing as a free agent with Winnipeg on July 4. He agreed to a
$700,000, one-year deal, AP said.  Rypien played in nine games last season for Vancouver,
where he collected an assist and 31 penalty minutes. He scored
16 points (nine goals, seven assists) and amassed 226 penalty
minutes in 119 career NHL games. Rypien also played in 17
playoff games.  True North Sports & Entertainment Ltd. moved the franchise
to Winnipeg and renamed it the Jets after buying the Atlanta
Thrashers in May. True North chose the name the Jets after the
team that played in the Manitoba capital for 24 years from 1979-
1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
