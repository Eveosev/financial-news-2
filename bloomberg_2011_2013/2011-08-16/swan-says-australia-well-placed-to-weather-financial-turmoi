Australia’s Treasurer  Wayne Swan 
said the country is better placed than other nations to ride out
global economic turmoil because of low government debt, a
healthy banking system and strong demand for exports.  “The global economic landscape is going to remain rocky
for some time, but Australia faces the current turmoil from a
position of genuine strength,” Swan said today in parliament,
according to an e-mailed copy of his prepared speech notes.  His comments address Australia’s economic outlook amid a
global slowdown prompted by a widening debt crisis in  Europe  and
 Standard & Poor’s  decision on the U.S. credit rating. Australia
is one of 14 major countries to have a AAA rating after S&P
downgraded the U.S., Swan said.  Australian banks have little direct exposure to stressed
European debt and have worked to “build up stronger funding,
liquidity and capital buffers” since 2008, he said. Australia
is also helped because two-thirds of the country’s exports are
bought by Asian markets, Swan said.  “Our exports to  China  and India, two of the world’s
fastest growing economies, are almost double those to the U.S.
and Europe,” he said. “While some of the goods we export to
China go into their exports to the U.S. and Europe, around 80
percent are predominantly for China’s own domestic use.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
