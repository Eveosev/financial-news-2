Indian equities fell on speculation
the country’s central bank may continue raising rates to contain
prices after inflation stayed at more than 9 percent in July for
the eighth consecutive month.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU)  fell 6 percent after India’s antitrust regulator
imposed a penalty of about 6 billion rupees ($132.5 million) on
the company for “abuse of dominance,” the Press Trust of India
reported today, citing a  Competition Commission  of India
official it didn’t identify.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the
biggest aluminum maker, fell 2.5 percent amid concern higher
commodity prices will crimp demand.  The wholesale-price index rose 9.22 percent from a year
earlier following a 9.44 percent jump in June, the commerce
ministry said today. The median of 22 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 9.2 percent increase.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
74.59 points, or 0.4 percent to 16,765.04, according to
preliminary closing prices in  Mumbai . Stocks also fell after
data showed European economic growth slowed more than economists
forecast in the second quarter as Germany’s recovery almost
ground to a halt amid the worsening sovereign-debt crisis.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index fell 0.7 percent to 5,035.80 and
its August futures settled at 5,040. The BSE 200 Index declined
0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
