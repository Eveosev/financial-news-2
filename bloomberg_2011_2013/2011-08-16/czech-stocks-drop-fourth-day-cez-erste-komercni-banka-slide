Czech shares fell, snapping a three-
day rally, as economic growth in  Europe  slowed more than
analysts expected, damping earnings prospects.  The PX gauge of 14 companies slid 1.1 percent to 1,005.4 at
its 4:28 p.m. close in Prague, as lenders  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  and
 Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  plunged at least 2 percent. The benchmark
gained 3.8 percent in the previous three sessions.  Global equities fell and the euro weakened against the
dollar after a report showed the economy of the euro area, the
main market for Czech exports, expanded 0.2 percent from the
previous three months, the worst performance since 2009.  New World Resources Plc, the biggest Czech coking-coal
producer, fell 3.7 percent to 168.5 koruna as Europeâ€™s benchmark
coal futures contracts fell for the first time in five days in
the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
