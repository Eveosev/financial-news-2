Oslo police logged a call that was
“probably” placed by terror suspect Anders Behring Breivik from
Utoeya island, where he killed 69 people in a shooting rampage.  Police wouldn’t comment on what was said in the call, which
was received about one minute prior to Breivik’s arrest, police
prosecutor Christian Hatlo said today at press conference.
Police are still going through the call log to identify a second
call Breivik may have made to police, he said.  Oslo-based  Verdens Gang  newspaper has reported that the
suspect tried to call police several times and reached
authorities about 30 minutes before he was arrested.  Police will seek a four-week extension of Breivik’s
detention in isolation at a court hearing on Aug. 19, Hatlo
said. The authorities will seek a “closed door” hearing to limit
possible contact with potential accomplices, Hatlo said.  Even though police don’t want Breivik to be present at the
hearing, they have received “indications” that he wants to
attend. Breivik, currently in eight-week pre-trial detention, is
accused of the twin terror attacks in Oslo and on Utoeya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
