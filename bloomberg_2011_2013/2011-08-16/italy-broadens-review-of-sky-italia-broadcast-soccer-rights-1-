Italy’s competition regulator
broadened a review of  Rupert Murdoch ’s SKY Italia’s broadcasting
rights for  World Cup  soccer matches to include the UEFA
Champions League, according to a statement posted on the
regulator’s website. The conclusion of the review has been
extended until June 30, 2012, the regulator said.  The Antitrust Authority’s initiative is “ groundless,”
SKY Italia, which denies any wrongdoing, said in an e-mailed
statement after the decision. The broadcaster “has complied
with all relevant competition rules in the purchase of rights
for both the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2012-2015 seasons of
the UEFA Champions League,” Sky said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
