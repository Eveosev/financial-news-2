  Siemens AG (SIE)  aims to increase revenue
in the Middle East by eight to 10 percent each year,  Dow Jones
Newswires  reported, citing an interview with head of the region
at the German engineering company.  Large infrastructure projects including power plants, as
well as continued industrialization and population growth will
drive demand, regional manager Erich Kaeser was cited as saying
in the interview. The growth target is in line with Siemens’s
aim of expanding at twice the rate of a region’s gross domestic
product, Dow Jones said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
