D/S Norden A/S,  Europe ’s largest
publicly traded commodities-shipping company, said charter rates
for bulk carriers will stay at low levels into 2012 as excess
vessel supply cuts the amount owners can charge.  “It will be challenging into the rest of this year and
into next year,” Chief Executive Officer Carsten Mortensen said
in a phone interview after the company reported an 88 percent
slump in second-quarter profit. He declined to forecast when
freight rates will rebound.  An influx of new bulk carriers depressed freight rates even
as global demand for the raw materials that Norden ships rose
between 5 percent and 6 percent in the first half of 2011,
Mortensen said.  The Baltic Dry Index, an overall measure of commodity
transportation costs, averaged 1,379 points, or 58 percent lower
in the quarter compared with the same period last year.
Hellerup, Denmark-based Norden kept its 2011 profit forecast
before interest and tax in a range between $55 million and $95
million, it said in an earnings statement today.  Net income for the three months through June dropped to $10
million from $83.3 million a year earlier, it said. Profit was
lower than the $24.7 million mean estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Second-quarter revenue from dry-cargo shipping fell 12
percent to $458.5 million from $525.9 million a year earlier,
according to the company. Income from Norden’s fleet of 38
product tankers, which ship refined goods like diesel and jet
fuel, was 72 percent higher at $102.6 million.  Tanker Earnings  Exports of refined products from the U.S. Gulf and strong
demand from  South America  and  Africa  boosted tanker earnings in
the quarter to levels that are expected to be higher on average
than the two previous years, Norden said.  Rates for medium range tankers that haul refined products
averaged $9,160 a day in the three months ended June 30, from
$6,361 a year earlier, according to data from Clarkson Research
Services, a unit of the world’s largest shipbroker.  Norden is moving to contracts of affreightment with miners
and traders to transport cargo rather than renting out its ships
for set amounts of time, Mortensen said. The new deals, or
contracts of affreightment, will be based on shipping specific
amounts of cargo to and from particular ports over a longer
period of time.  China ’s role as the driver of dry-bulk demand, along with
strong raw materials prices, suggested customers were sheltered
from economic problems in Europe and the U.S., he said.  Shares Fall  “There may be some bumps on the way or Chinese politicians
may wish to dampen the growth a little bit but the long-term
trend is clear and we are very confident for the next five to 10
years,” he said.  Norden fell 10.70 kroner, or 7 percent, to close at 142.30
kroner in Copenhagen trading, the lowest level since Dec. 5,
2008. The drop reduced its market value to 6.12 billion kroner
($1.2 billion).  RS Platou Markets said today that Norden’s second-quarter
figures were slightly weaker than expected. “However, the
company remains well positioned with limited debt and 94 percent
dry bulk contract coverage for 2011 and 50 percent for 2012,”
equity research shipping analyst Frode Morkedal wrote in an e-
mailed note.  Norden owns 132 bulk carriers and operates 13, with a
further 41 ships on order, according to its website, updated on
Aug. 15. Ninety-four percent of the fleet is chartered for the
rest of the year, the company said.  Break-Even Rates  The average amount each bulk carrier earned in the three
months to June 30 was $18,640, higher than the $13,040 the dry-
cargo fleet needs to break even in 2011, according to the
company. Cash break-even rates will fall to $11,217 a day in
2012, the company said.  The tanker fleet earned $14,989 per ship during the second
quarter and needs $11,195 a day to break even in 2011, declining
to $10,648 in 2012. Thirty-seven percent of the fleet is
chartered for 2011, the company said.  The owned fleet was worth $1.7 billion at June 30,
according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
