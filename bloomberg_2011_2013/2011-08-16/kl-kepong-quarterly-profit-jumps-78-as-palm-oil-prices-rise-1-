Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd. (KLK) ,  Malaysia ’s
third-biggest listed  palm oil  producer by market value, said
third-quarter profit jumped 78 percent after fetching more for
its edible oil.  Net income climbed to 432.8 million ringgit ($145 million),
or 40.64 sen a share, in the three months to June 30, from 243.5
million ringgit, or 22.87 sen, a year earlier, the company said
in a filing to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange today. Revenue
surged 62 percent to 2.95 billion ringgit.  KL Kepong said it fetched an average 3,085 ringgit per
metric ton for its palm oil in the quarter, compared with 2,562
ringgit a year earlier. World production of palm oil may rise
8.5 percent to 49.8 million tons this year as yields improve,
researcher Oil World said on July 19.  Full-year earnings will be “significantly” higher because
of plantation contributions, a “satisfactory” performance from
its oleochemical division, and one-off gains from the disposals
of associates, the Perak-based company said in the statement.  The group sold its remaining 40 percent stake in Barry
Callebaut Malaysia Sdn. for 117.7 million ringgit in April,
according to a  Kuala Lumpur  stock exchange filing at the time.  Profit from the company’s manufacturing division gained 68
percent to 95.5 million ringgit, underpinned by the alcohol
business of its oleochemical division, it said. The group’s
retail division had a 7.8 million-ringgit loss, compared with a
4.5 million-ringgit profit in the same period last year, the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
