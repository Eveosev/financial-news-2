What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that
unexpected rain in parts of the Midwest overnight will boost
output, while signs of slowing global economic growth reduce
demand, Chad Henderson, a market analyst at Prime Agricultural
Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin, said in a telephone
interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 6 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago on speculation that rain will boost U.S. yields just
as plants need moisture to fill pods with beans, Henderson said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open down 0.3 cent to 0.4
cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $1.50 to $2.50
lower for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 6 cents to 9 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that global demand may slow for
food and animal feed made from the grain, Henderson said. Rain
may aid crops in  Canada , Australia and Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
