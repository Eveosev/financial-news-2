Peru ’s sol held near a one-week high
as companies sold dollars to pay local income taxes.  The sol traded at 2.7427 per U.S. dollar at today’s close,
from 2.7425 yesterday.  “Dollar supply has increased” as Peruvian firms led by
metal exporters buy soles to pay taxes, said Ricardo Villamonte,
head trader at Banco de Credito del Peru, the nation’s biggest
lender.  The central bank didn’t buy dollars in the  currency market 
today, it said on its website.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 6.01
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 206 at 3:17 p.m. New York time, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
