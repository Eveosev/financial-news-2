Dong Energy A/S, Denmark’s biggest
power company, sold its 50 percent share of  Norway ’s Nordkraft
Vind to its partner in the venture for 145 million kroner ($27
million) as it focuses on offshore wind projects and the U.K.  Dong sold the stake in the developer and operator of two
wind farms in northern Norway to Nordkraft Produksjon AS, which
owns the other 50 percent, Dong said today in a  statement .  “We want to focus on offshore wind and focus on the
countries where we see the most potential for offshore wind,”
Andreas Krog, a Dong spokesman, said today by phone. Most of its
projects are in the U.K., or Denmark and  Germany , he said.  While Skaerbaek-based Dong exited the Midtfjellet Norwegian
wind project in July, it still has stakes in  Kvalheim Kraft AS ,
owner of the Mehuken I and II wind farms, and  Zephyr AS .  Nordkraft Vind operates the 6.9-megawatt Nygaardsfjellet 1
onshore wind farm and is building the 25.3-megawatt
Nygaardsfjellet 2 park, according to Dong.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
