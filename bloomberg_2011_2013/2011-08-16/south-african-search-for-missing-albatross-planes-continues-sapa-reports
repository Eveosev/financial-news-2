The search for two aircraft that
went missing over  South Africa ’s Limpopo province continued
today, the South African Press Association reported, citing
police spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi.  The search for the aircraft is being hampered by rain and
fog, the Johannesburg-based news service said. There were 13
people aboard the Albatross planes which are presumed to have
crashed in the George’s Valley area between Polokwane and
Tzaneen, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
