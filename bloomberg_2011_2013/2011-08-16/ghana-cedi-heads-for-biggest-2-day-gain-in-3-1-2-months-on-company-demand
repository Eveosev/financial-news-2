Ghana ’s cedi headed for the biggest
two-day gain in 3 1/2 months against the dollar as
telecommunication and mining companies sold the U.S. currency to
pay for costs incurred in the currency of West Africa’s second-
biggest economy.  The currency of the world’s second-largest cocoa producer
gained as much as 0.8 percent to 1.5225 per dollar, before
trading 0.6 percent up at 1.5260 as of 12:40 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close at
this level will be the strongest since Aug. 8.  “Liquidity on the market was boosted today by dollar
inflows from the telecommunications and mining industries,”
Biggles Amponsah, a currency trader at the local unit of Access
Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview. “Traders bought the
U.S. currency to import goods but not enough to outweigh
supply.”  Vodafone Group Plc, the world’s biggest mobile-phone
company, and MTN Group Ltd.,  Africa ’s largest mobile-network
operator, have units in Ghana. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., the
continent’s biggest gold miner, and Newmont Mining Corp. of
 Greenwood Village , Colorado, have mines in the West African
nation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
