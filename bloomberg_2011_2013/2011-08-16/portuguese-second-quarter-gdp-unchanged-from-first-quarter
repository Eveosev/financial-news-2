Portugal â€™s economy stalled in the
second quarter from the first three months, the National
Statistics Institute said in a preliminary report.  Gross domestic product was unchanged from the first
quarter, when it contracted 0.6 percent. Economists had
predicted a decline of 1.1 percent, according to five forecasts
in a Bloomberg News survey. Growth fell 0.9 percent from a year
earlier, the Lisbon-based institute said today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
