The erroneous trade that drove up
EVOC Intelligent Technology Ltd. almost fivefold in  Hong Kong 
trading may have been caused by an investor seeking to buy
shares of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.’s biggest supplier.  EVOC, a Shenzhen-based maker of electronics that trades
under the “2308” stock symbol, jumped to HK$3.46 at 9:30 a.m.,
seconds after the market opened, from the previous day’s close
of 70 Hong Kong cents. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.
subsequently said the transaction of 12,000 EVOC shares was an
error.  The trade occurred on a day that  Foxconn International
Holdings Ltd. (2038) , the Motorola contract manufacturer that trades
under the “2038” symbol, surged as much as 17 percent to
HK$4.02 after  Google Inc. (GOOG)  agreed to purchase Motorola Mobility
for $12.5 billion.  “You probably have to assume it’s a fat-finger trading
error,” said  Gavin Parry , managing director at Parry
International Trading Ltd. in Hong Kong. A dealer intending to
trade Foxconn shares mistakenly entered EVOC’s ticker, he said.  Scott Sapp, a spokesman at the Hong Kong exchange, said the
bourse doesn’t comment on individual companies. A company
official at EVOC, who only identified herself by her surname Yu,
said she had no information about the trade, as did Vincent Tong, a spokesman at Foxconn International.  Foxconn International’s surge was the stock’s biggest
intraday gain since December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
