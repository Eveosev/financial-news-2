The State Department targeted the
leader of the Gaza-based Army of Islam for sanctions today.  The action freezes any U.S. assets of Mumtaz Dughmush,
leader of the Army of Islam, a splinter group of Hamas that is
ideologically aligned with al-Qaeda, according to a State
Department statement.  The Army of Islam, founded in late 2005, is responsible for
numerous terrorist attacks against the governments of  Israel  and
Egypt, the State Department said. Under Dughmush’s leadership,
the department said, the group launched rocket attacks against
Israel from Palestinian territories and it kidnapped two Fox
News journalists, including one American.  “This action will help stem the flow of financial and
other assistance to this terrorist,” the State Department said
in a  written statement . The action prohibits any U.S. residents
from engaging in any business with Dughmush.  The State Department in May designated the Army of Islam as
a  foreign terrorist organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
