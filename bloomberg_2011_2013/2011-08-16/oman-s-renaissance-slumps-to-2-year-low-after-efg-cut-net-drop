Renaissance Services SAOG (RNSS)  dropped to
the lowest in more than two years as EFG-Hermes Holding SAE cut
the Omani provider of services to the oil and gas industry to
“neutral” and after first-half profit tumbled 77 percent.  The shares slumped 10 percent to 0.559 rial, the lowest
intraday level since April 2009, at 10:44 a.m. in Muscat. The
stock has tumbled 19 percent in the past two days, the biggest
drop since the company started trading in 2002.  EFG lowered the stock from “buy” with a 12-month price
estimate of 0.68 rial. Net income retreated to 2.26 million
rials ($5.9 million) from 9.79 million rials a year earlier, the
company said Aug. 15.  Separately, the company said yesterday the chief executive
officer of its Topaz unit stepped down in May after it
“uncovered some serious issues” at the unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
