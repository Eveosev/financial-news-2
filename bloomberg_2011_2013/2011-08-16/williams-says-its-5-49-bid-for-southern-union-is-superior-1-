(Corrects bid price in headline.)  Williams Cos. is sticking to its
$5.49 billion all-cash offer to buy pipeline company  Southern
Union Co. (SUG) , saying it’s a better deal for shareholders than
 Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE) ’s bid.  Williams’s $44-a-share proposal provides more certainty and
a better value than  Energy Transfer ’s cash-and-equity bid
because it isn’t linked to a declining stock price, the Tulsa,
Oklahoma-based company said in a statement today.  “If I was shareholder, I’d rather take $44 guaranteed all
cash, rather than a combination of cash and stock in this
volatile market,” Andy Levi, an analyst at Caris & Co., in a
telephone interview, said. Levi doesn’t rate any of the
companies involved in the deal nor does he own their stock.  Energy Transfer, based in  Dallas , raised its bid to $44.25
a share on July 19, with up to 60% of the price to be paid in
cash and the remainder in stock at a rate of one publicly traded
partnership unit for each Southern Union share. It was the
second time the company increased its offer to outbid Williams
in an effort to complete the biggest purchase of a pipeline
operator this year.  Energy Transfer has fallen 9.4 percent since its July 19
offer, when its units were trading at $43.53. Since  Standard &
Poor’s , the New York-based credit rating subsidiary of McGraw-
Hill Cos., downgraded the U.S. to AA+ from AAA on Aug. 5, the
S&P 500 Energy Index has fallen to 503.65 from 506.81, less than
1 percent.  Market Exposure  Williams said its offer now represents a 4 percent premium
to Energy Transfer’s proposal, based on today’s closing price
for the pipeline partnership’s units, and assuming Southern
Union shareholders elect the maximum cash payout. The company
conveyed its thinking to the Southern Union board in a letter
dated today.  “Southern Union’s current agreement with Energy Transfer
includes illiquid partnership units whose value will be exposed
to equity markets in the months until closing and beyond,” Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams, said in the
statement.  Spokespeople for Southern Union and Energy Transfer didn’t
immediately respond to voice-mail messages seeking comment.  The Williams release was issued after the close of regular
trading on U.S. markets. Southern Union rose 77 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $42.40 at 5:03 p.m. in  New York . Williams rose 5
cents to $28.20 at 4:42 p.m. and Energy Transfer was unchanged
at $39.42.  On June 16, Energy Transfer first agreed to buy Southern
Union in an all-stock transaction valued at $33 a share.
Williams countered on June 23 at $39 a share in cash. On July 5,
Energy Transfer boosted its offer and Williams responded on July
14 by bidding $44 a share.  Both buyers are vying for Houston-based Southern Union’s
15,000 miles (24,000 kilometers) of natural-gas pipelines, which
connect new fields in Texas and  Oklahoma  to markets in the U.S.
Midwest and  Florida .  To contact the reporter on this story:
