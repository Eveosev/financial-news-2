South African President  Jacob Zuma 
nominated Constitutional Court Judge Mogoeng Mogoeng as the
nation’s next chief justice, overlooking several more
experienced jurists for the post.  The top judge’s post became vacant on Aug. 14, after
Sandile Ngcobo declined reappointment following a court wrangle
over the legality of Zuma’s offer to extend his tenure. Under
the Constitution, Zuma will only be able to make a final
appointment after consulting with the Judicial Service
Commission and the leaders of political parties represented in
Parliament.  “The fact that President Zuma has nominated one of the
newest appointees with the least amount of experience on the
Constitutional Court is surprising,” Raylene Keightley,
director of the University of Witwatersrand’s Centre for Applied
Legal Studies, said by telephone from Johannesburg today.
“There is a very experienced judge in Dikgang Moseneke, the
deputy judge president” who was the obvious candidate, she
said.  Mogoeng, 50, has been on the country’s highest court since
2009. Trained at the University of Zululand and the University
of  South Africa , he previously served as a judge in South
Africa’s Labor Appeal Court and as judge president of the  High
Court  in the North West Province.  Mogoeng “has demonstrated his expertise and keen interest
in the transformation of the judiciary and the promotion of
access to justice for all,” the presidency said in a  statement 
on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
