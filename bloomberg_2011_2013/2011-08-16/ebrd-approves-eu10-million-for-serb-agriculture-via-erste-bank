The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development will extend “up to 10 million euros‘‘ ($14.4
million) to help provide Serbian agribusiness with working
capital through Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ’s local unit.  Serbian agriculture companies will be able to use their
warehouse receipts as collateral, the London-based lender said
in an e-mailed statement today.  As part of a 70 million-euro Warehouse Financing Framework,
the loans will promote the use of the receipts that
‘‘demonstrate the viability of lending against agricultural
commodities,’’ the bank said.  Since 2010, the EBRD has made similar arrangements with the
local units of  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , Banca Intesa SpA and  Societe
Generale (GLE)  SA.  The EBRD said it has directly committed more than 365
million euros in over 29 projects in  Serbia ’s agribusiness since
2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
