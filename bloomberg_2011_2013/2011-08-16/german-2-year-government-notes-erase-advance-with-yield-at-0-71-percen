German two-year notes erased an
advance and 10-year bonds pared their gain.  The yield on the two-year securities was little changed at
0.71 percent as of 2:30 p.m. in  London  after earlier falling to
0.65 percent. Yields on benchmark 10-year bunds were less than
one basis point lower at 2.32 percent after touching 2.27
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
