U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary
Clinton  said al-Qaeda’s arm in  Iraq  may be behind the bombings
yesterday that hit cities across that country.  “It could very well be Al-Qaeda in Iraq trying to reassert
itself,” Clinton said today at a forum at the National Defense
University in  Washington . At least 63 people were killed in 17
cities, the  Associated Press  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
