The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:52 a.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.7 percent to 13,502.33 while the
Colcap Index rose 0.3 percent to 1,615.75.  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA CB), the owner of
 Colombia ’s biggest airline, rose 0.5 percent to 4,500 pesos. The
company reported second-quarter profit of 2 billion pesos ($1.1
million), compared to a 157 billion peso loss a year earlier.
The company said revenue rose 23 percent from a year ago to 1.6
trillion pesos, according to a regulatory filing after the
market closed Aug. 12.  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO)  , Colombia’s biggest bank, rose
5.2 percent to 28,400 pesos, the highest since Aug. 3. The stock
rebounded after it was undervalued on last week’s fall on global
market volatility, said Camilo Rubiano, an analyst at Afin SA.
Shares dipped to 25,480 pesos on Aug. 8, the lowest in nearly a
year.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota (ETB)  SA, the
phone company serving Colombia’s capital, rose 4.1 percent, the
most since July 21, to 562 pesos. Leading candidate Gustavo Petro said if elected mayor of Bogota he would seek to merge ETB
with other state-controlled companies in the capital that manage
water, energy and transportation, according to RCN.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, rose 1 percent to
46,640 pesos. Rubiales’s share price has a year-end upside
potential of 66 percent on the company’s “solid fundamental
performance as shown through consistent compliance with
production targets, high rate of exploratory success and growing
levels of profitability and liquidity,” Samuel David Garcia, an
analyst at brokerage Valores Bancolombia, said in a report e-
mailed today.  The shares are being traded at multiples lower than peers,
the report said. The shares have fallen 26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
