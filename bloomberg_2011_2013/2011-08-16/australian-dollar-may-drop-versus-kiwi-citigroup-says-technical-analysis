The Australian dollar may drop
against its New Zealand counterpart after a technical correction
similar to one seen in June, according to Citigroup Inc.  A daily close for the Australian dollar below the recent
low of NZ$1.2302 may signal further weakening to NZ$1.21, where
the trend channel meets the lows of 2010, wrote  Tom Fitzpatrick ,
chief technical analyst in  New York  at Citigroup, in a research
note. The Aussie failed to strengthen through NZ$1.2630 after
rising NZ$0.0347 over the past week. That move is similar to the
period from June 9 to 16, when the Aussie gained $NZ0.0385
before falling.  “We would not be surprised to see a test of NZ$1.21,”
Fitzpatrick said in the research note, written with Shyam Devani, technical strategist in  London , and Alex Good, technical
analyst in New York. Citigroup didn’t immediately return a call
for comment.  The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to NZ$1.2524 at 2:11
p.m. in New York, from NZ$1.2614 yesterday. The Aussie touched
NZ$1.2319 on Aug. 10, the lowest level since July 2010.  The spread between the yields on two-year Australian swaps
and two-year New Zealand swaps is trending lower after widening
17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, this month. The
narrowing spread mirrors a decline after the difference
increased 20 basis points in July before contracting.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
