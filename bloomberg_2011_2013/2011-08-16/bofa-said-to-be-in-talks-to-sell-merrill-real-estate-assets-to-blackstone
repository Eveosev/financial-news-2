Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest
U.S. bank by assets, is in talks to sell real estate investments
held by its Merrill Lynch unit to  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  for as
much as $1 billion, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  The assets include properties in Europe, the U.S. and  South
America , said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the negotiations are private. Bank of America in July 2010 hired
Blackstone to manage Merrill’s Asian real estate investments
while retaining ownership in what was a $2 billion private-
equity fund.  Jerome Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America in
Charlotte, North Carolina, declined to comment, as did Christine
Anderson, a spokeswoman for Blackstone in  New York . The talks
were reported earlier today by the Financial Times.  Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan
has been selling assets including First Republic Bank and its
stake in BlackRock Inc. to focus on corporate borrowers,
investment banking and U.S. retail clients and to comply with
new international capital standards. The company agreed
yesterday to sell its Canadian credit-card unit to Toronto-
Dominion Bank.  The lender will pursue the “aggressive selling of non-core
assets to continue to generate capital, increase our focus and
lower risk,” Moynihan said in a conference call last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
