Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) ,  Switzerland ’s
biggest life insurer, may say profit in the first half was
little changed after cost savings offset the impact of low
interest rates and the strengthening franc.  The insurer may post net income of 270 million Swiss francs
($345 million), compared with 268 million francs a year earlier,
according to the average estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The Zurich-based insurer reports earnings tomorrow at
7:00 a.m. local time.  By the end of March, Swiss Life had completed 90 percent of
its program to reduce costs by 400 million francs and cut 520
jobs in Switzerland. Lowering expenses may help counter the
impact of the franc’s surge to a record against the euro and the
dollar, as well as low  interest rates , analysts said.  Swiss Life’s net result for the first time will include
earnings from the acquired National Suisse’s group life
business, according to a spokesman. The life insurer bought the
business, which sells retirement-saving products to companies
and generated 223 million francs of premiums in 2009, in January
to lower the cost of writing policies.  Swiss Life aims to generate a return on equity of 10
percent to 12 percent by 2012 from selling more pension
products. The life insurer is targeting a new business margin of
2.2 percent by the same date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
