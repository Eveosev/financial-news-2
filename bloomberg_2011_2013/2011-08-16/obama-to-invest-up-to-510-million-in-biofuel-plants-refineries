The Obama administration will spend
as much as $510 million in the next three years to build or
overhaul biofuel plants and refineries.  The U.S. departments of Agriculture, Energy and Navy will
invest with private companies that will have to at least match
the U.S. contributions, according to a statement today.  “America’s long-term national security depends upon a
commercially viable domestic biofuels market that will benefit
taxpayers,” Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said in the statement.  President  Barack Obama  is seeking a one-third cut in U.S.
oil imports by 2025 to reduce dependence on Middle East supplies
after the turmoil in  Libya  sent  oil prices  to the highest level
in more than two years in February. Obama called for incentives
to boost production of oil, natural gas and biofuels, tougher
fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles and greater reliance on
cleaner sources of energy on March 30.  The three agencies are targeting companies that will
develop aviation and marine biofuels for military and commercial
transportation, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
