The maker of  Georgia ’s Borjomi
mineral water, which has been banned in  Russia  for five years,
said it hasn’t asked for imports to its neighbor to be resumed.  IDS Borjomi  Georgia didn’t ask Russia to lift the ban,
Nitsa Cholokashvili, a spokeswoman for the company, said by
phone from Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi, today.  The Interfax news service said earlier today that Russia is
considering a request by an unidentified company to restart
imports of Borjomi, citing the head of Russia’s consumer
watchdog, Gennady Onishchenko.  Russia prohibited imports of Georgian mineral water and
wine in 2006 after Georgia expelled four Russian servicemen who
it accused of espionage. Russia is seeking Georgian support for
its bid to join the  World Trade Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
