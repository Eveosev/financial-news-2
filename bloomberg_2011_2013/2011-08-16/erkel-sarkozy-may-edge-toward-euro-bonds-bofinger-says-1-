German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy may announce proposals that
“go in the direction” of joint euro-area bonds, said  Peter Bofinger , an economic adviser to the German government.  “Merkel and Sarkozy have to do something against this”
market uncertainty when they meet in Paris today, Bofinger said
in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “They cannot end this
day empty handed. I think they have to deliver something.”  There is “no alternative” to the introduction of euro
bonds to counter the market turmoil that has spread to Italy and
 Spain , Bofinger said.  “I don’t think we will have euro bonds by the end of this
day,” he said. “But I think they will show a commitment to go
in this direction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
