The U.S. Treasury Department has
received a total of $159.5 billion in proceeds from the wind-
down of its portfolio of agency-guaranteed, mortgage-backed
securities, according to a department release today.  During July, the Treasury received $12.7 billion in
proceeds, and principal and interest payments of $2.2 billion.
Treasury now has recovered more than 70 percent of its original
$225 billion in MBS investments. Treasury still has $82.7
billion in MBS remaining in its portfolio.  “The MBS market has improved considerably since Treasury
purchased these securities,” said  Matthew Rutherford , Treasury
deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, in a release.
“Based on current market conditions, Treasury expects to make a
profit for taxpayers on this investment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
