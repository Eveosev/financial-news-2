The Libyan embassy in  Washington  has
reopened under the control of the U.S.-recognized rebel
governing body that’s seeking to oust  Muammar Qaddafi , the State
Department announced today.  The U.S. has accredited Ali Aujali as charge d’affairs,
representing the rebels’ Transitional National Council, State
Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.  Aujali was Qaddafi’s ambassador to the U.S. before
switching to the side of the rebels. The State Department
ordered the Libyan embassy closed in March and expelled
diplomats loyal to Qaddafi.  The U.S. recognized the Transitional National Council as
the legitimate government of Libya in July.  Reopening the embassy will help Aujali regain control of
the embassy’s bank account, which was frozen along with all
U.S.-based Libyan assets, valued at about $30 billion.  “We are in the process of working through the licensing
process so that we can return those embassy assets to the charge
for his use for embassy operations,” Nuland told reporters
today at a State Department briefing.  U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  today said the rebel
forces are moving toward Tripoli and Qaddafi’s “days are
numbered.”  Nuland said the Transitional National Council plans to hold
an official flag-raising ceremony marking the reopening of the
Washington embassy “later next week.”  The U.S. launched air strikes with NATO allies beginning in
March to protect civilians and force Qaddafi from power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
