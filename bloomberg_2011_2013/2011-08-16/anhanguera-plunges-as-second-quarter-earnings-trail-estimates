Anhanguera Educacional Participacoes
SA (AEDU3) , Brazil’s largest education company by market value, plunged
after reporting second-quarter profit that missed analysts’
estimates.  Shares tumbled 11 percent to 24.95 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the worst
performer in the  BM&FBovespa Small Cap (SMLLBV)  Index. The stock earlier
dropped 15 percent, the most intraday since October 2008.  Results were hit by a “sharp decline” in the number of
students enrolled in distance learning programs, Luis Azevedo
and Tales Freire, analysts at Bradesco Corretora, wrote in a
note to clients.  Anhanguera’s second-quarter net income fell 10 percent to 8
million reais ($5 million), from 8.9 million reais a year ago,
according to a regulatory filing. Analysts had forecast net
income of 29.2 million reais on an adjusted basis, according to
the average of five estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
