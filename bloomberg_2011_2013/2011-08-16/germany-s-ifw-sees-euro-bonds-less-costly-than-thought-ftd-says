The cost to  Germany  in the form of
higher  interest rates  if common euro-area bonds were introduced
could be as low as 10 billion euros ($14 billion) a year,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing the Kiel Institute
for the World Economy.  Germany would have to pay around 0.5 percentage points in
interest on its government debt more than before, economist Jens
Boysen-Hogrefe was quoted by the newspaper as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
