Malawi civil society groups called
off a national protest planned for tomorrow after a citizens
group won a court injunction to stop the demonstrations and to
give time for talks with government, said Undule Mwakasungula,
director of the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation.  Organizers of the planned protest were holding talks with
the state today, Mwakasungula said in a statement given on the
Blantyre-based Zodiak Broadcasting Station.  The groups were to stage a second round of demonstrations
against government policies and continuing fuel and currency
shortages. Nineteen people died during protests last month,
according to President Bingu wa Mutharika.  To contact the reporter on this story:
