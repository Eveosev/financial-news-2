Ghana National Petroleum Corp.  and
 PetroSaudi International Ltd.  signed a preliminary agreement to
jointly explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas as the
West African nation starts developing its  energy industry .  The two will consider projects in oil field services,
infrastructure, and facilities development, state-owned Ghana
National said in an e-mailed statement today.  Ghana became Africaâ€™s newest oil exporter after production
began at its Jubilee field on Dec. 15. The field produces 80,000
barrels per day and will rise to 120,000 barrels this month or
next, according to operator Tullow Oil Plc.  Ghana plans to spend $1.3 billion, part of $3 billion in
loans from the  China Development Bank , to develop infrastructure
and produce gas from Jubilee, Ghana National Gas Co. Chief
Executive Officer George Sipa Yankey said in an interview on
Aug. 12.  The rest of the loan, which is awaiting parliamentary
approval, will be used to construct railway lines, road networks
and expand harbors along the coast, Sipa Yankey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
