The Australian dollar rose to the
highest level in almost two weeks versus its U.S. counterpart as
commodities gained.  The kiwi, as  New Zealand ’s dollar is nicknamed,
strengthened for a fifth consecutive day against the greenback,
the longest winning streak since March 25.  “There’s a little bit more comfort in the market,” said
Steven Englander, head of Group of 10 currency strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in New York.  Australia ’s dollar strengthened 0.4 percent to $1.0531 at
1:56 p.m. in New York, from $1.0486 yesterday. It touched
$1.0602, the strongest level since Aug. 4. The Aussie was little
changed at 80.54 yen.  New Zealand’s currency rose 0.2 percent to 83.78 U.S.
cents, from 83.61 cents, after earlier rising to 84.26 cents.
The kiwi slipped 0.2 percent to 64.06 yen, from 64.21.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of raw materials
climbed 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
