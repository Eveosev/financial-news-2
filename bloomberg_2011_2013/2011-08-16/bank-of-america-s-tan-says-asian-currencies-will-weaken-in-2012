Christy Tan, a foreign-exchange
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  Singapore ,
comments on the outlook for Asian currencies in a research note
released today.  The bank predicts the Singapore dollar will weaken 1.5
percent to 1.22 per dollar by the end of September 2012. It also
sees Malaysia’s ringgit dropping 1 percent to 3.00 and the
 Taiwan dollar  falling 3.7 percent to NT$30.00.  “Our economists are expecting lower-than-consensus non-oil
exports growth for Singapore, firmer headline inflation in
Malaysia accompanied by growth moderation in the second quarter,
and a more pessimistic outcome for export orders in  Taiwan . All
these will likely mean that Singapore, Taiwan, and possibly
Malaysia, could steer toward growth-supporting policies.  ‘‘Our Asian currency forecasts reflect cautious optimism
for the rest of this year and potentially a weaker trend next
year. The pressure for currency appreciation to ward off
inflation will likely take a backseat. Further  Singapore dollar 
strength will likely draw its source from safe-haven inflows
instead of a concerted policy push.  ‘‘We expect a greater risk of continued Taiwanese dollar
underperformance toward the end of the year, in view of
sustained equity outflows.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
