Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S.
home improvement retailer, raised its full-year profit forecast
after second-quarter profit exceeded analysts’ estimates,
spurred by increased traffic and spending by customers.  Net income advanced 14 percent to $1.36 billion, or 86
cents a share, in the quarter ended July 31, from $1.19 billion,
or 72 cents, a year earlier, the Atlanta-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts projected 82 cents, the average
of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Home Depot, led by Chief Executive Officer Frank Blake,
boosted the number of transactions by 1.1 percent to 373
million, the sixth increase in the past seven quarters. Lawn and
garden sales rebounded from rainy, colder-than-average
temperatures in the first quarter, boosting sales from older
stores more than analysts had projected.  “Home Depot has gotten their mojo back,”  Joe Feldman , an
analyst at Telsey Advisory Group in  New York , said in an
interview. “They are operating well, the stores look better,
there’s more service on the floor.”  Revenue from Home Depot stores open at least 12 months
climbed 4.3 percent, exceeding the median forecast of a 1
percent gain by Janney Capital Markets, Piper Jaffray Cos. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. Revenue gained 4.2 percent to $20.2
billion, helped by purchases related to storm repairs. The value
of the average sale rose 3.3 percent to $54.04.  Reinventing Stores  The company increased its per-share profit forecast for the
year ending Jan. 29 to $2.34. It had projected $2.24 in May.
Analysts expected $2.30. Last year, employees started using
handheld mobile devices to process inventory coming into stores
and help customers find items.  The results outperformed Lowe’s Co., the second-largest
U.S. home-improvement retailer, which yesterday said profit in
its fiscal 2011 will be less than it previously projected after
comparable-store sales fell. Same-store sales slipped 0.3
percent in the second quarter, missing the Mooresville, North
Carolina-based retailer’s forecast for a gain of 2 percent.  “Comp sales are night and day,” said  Walter Todd , chief
investment officer at Greenwood Capital Inc. “Home Depot has
done a better job in this environment with a laser focus on
 customer service  and reinventing its stores.”  The firm, based
in Greenwood,  South Carolina , owns 139,000 Home Depot shares and
doesn’t hold Lowe’s stock.  Home Depot rose $1.66, or 5.3 percent, to $33.12 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
declined 5.5 percent this year. Lowe’s gained 41 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $20.09 and has tumbled 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
