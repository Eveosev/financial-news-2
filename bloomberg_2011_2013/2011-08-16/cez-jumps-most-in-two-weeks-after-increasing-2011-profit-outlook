CEZ AS (CEZ)  climbed the most in more than
two weeks after the  Czech Republic ’s largest power producer
increased its forecast for full-year net income.  The stock gained 1.5 percent to 764 koruna at the 4:24 p.m.
close in Prague, the biggest one-day gain since July 29. That
made CEZ the second-best performer in the country’s PX gauge of
14 companies, which declined 1.1 percent.  CEZ raised its 2011 profit outlook by 500 million koruna to
40.6 billion koruna ($2.4 billion), the company said in a
statement released yesterday after the market closed. Earlier
that day, the stock erased most of its 3.2 percent gain after
second-quarter earnings missed analyst estimates, according to a
statement on the Prague-based utility’s website.  “The negative impact of yesterday’s earnings has been
partly offset by the improved full-year outlook,”  Josef Nemy ,
an analyst at Komercni Banka AS in Prague, said by phone today.  Global stocks fell and the euro weakened against the dollar
after a report showed gross domestic product in the euro area,
the main market for Czech exports, expanded 0.2 percent from the
previous three months. That was the worst performance since
2009, damping prospects for company earnings.  Net income in the period fell 40 percent from a year
earlier to 6.7 billion koruna because of lower electricity
prices and new Czech taxes imposed on carbon-dioxide emitters,
CEZ said on its website yesterday. The mean estimate of 14
analysts polled by Bloomberg was for 7.6 billion koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
