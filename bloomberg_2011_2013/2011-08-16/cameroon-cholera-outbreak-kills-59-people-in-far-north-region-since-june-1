A cholera outbreak in Cameroonâ€™s Far
North region killed 59 people from June 1 to Aug. 12, Rebecca
Djao, the regional delegate for public health, said.  More than 1,300 new cases of the disease have been found
during that period, Djao said in a telephone interview today
from Maroua, the capital of the Far North region.  The disease worsened after heavy rains disrupted power
supplies and water systems, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
