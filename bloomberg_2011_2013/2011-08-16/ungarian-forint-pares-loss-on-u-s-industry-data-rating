The forint pared losses against the
Swiss franc and euro after data showed industrial production in
the U.S. climbed in July by the most this year and  Fitch Ratings 
affirmed its AAA credit rating for the worldâ€™s biggest economy.  The Hungarian currency weakened 0.4 percent against the
franc to 238 as of 3:52 p.m. in Budapest, after declining more
than 2 percent. The forint depreciated 0.3 percent to 269.9 per
euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
