Iraq  earned more than $48 billion in
revenue from crude oil exports in the first seven months of this
year, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said.  The country’s 2011 oil exports will exceed $80 billion and
have already “helped the government ease the  budget deficit  and
carry out several projects,” Luaibi said today in a speech in
Baghdad.  Iraq’s oil exports now average at 2.2 million barrels a
day, he said. Crude exports had declined to fewer than 2.2
million in July because of technical problems after having
reached 2.273 million in June, Falah al-Amri, chairman of the
State Oil Marketing Organization, said in an interview Aug. 1.  “Oil exports are due to rise to 2.5 million barrels per
day next year,” Luaibi told reporters after the speech.  Iraq, home to the world’s fifth-biggest oil reserves, is
struggling to boost energy exports, the main source of revenue
to help rebuild an economy shattered by years of conflict and
economic sanctions.  The country has signed 15 gas and oil licenses since the
2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that ousted the regime of
President  Saddam Hussein . The government has also invited
companies to bid for a new, fourth round of exploration rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
