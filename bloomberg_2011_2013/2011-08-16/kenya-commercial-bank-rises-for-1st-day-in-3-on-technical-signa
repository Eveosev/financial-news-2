Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the East
African nation’s biggest lender by assets and outlets, rose for
the first time in three days on a technical signal that
indicates the stock is poised to rise.  Shares in KCB, as the lender is known, climbed as much as
4.8 percent to 21.75 shillings before trading 1.2 percent higher
at 21 shillings as of 1:12 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  Yesterday, the stock’s 14-day relative strength index
closed at 26, which is below the 30 level that signals to some
technical analysts a security is poised to increase. The RSI, as
the index is known, identifies possible turning points in
indexes or securities by measuring the degree that gains and
losses outpace each other in a given period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
