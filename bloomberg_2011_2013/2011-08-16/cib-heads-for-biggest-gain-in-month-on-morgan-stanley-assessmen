Commercial International Bank Egypt
SAE (COMI) , the Arab country’s biggest publicly traded lender, advanced
to the highest level in more than a week after Morgan Stanley
raised its recommendation to “equal weight.”  The shares of the Cairo-based bank gained 0.7 percent to
25.23 Egyptian pounds at the 1:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the
highest level since Aug. 8. The shares earlier rose as much as
1.8 percent.  Egypt ’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell 0.4 percent.  Morgan Stanley lifted its recommendation on the bank from
“underweight” as second-quarter revenue and asset quality were
“encouraging,” the bank said in a report today.  The lender, also known as CIB, last week reported quarterly
profit of 442.9 million Egyptian pounds ($74 million). That
compares with the 406 million-pound median estimate of nine
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Profit was 11 percent lower than
a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
