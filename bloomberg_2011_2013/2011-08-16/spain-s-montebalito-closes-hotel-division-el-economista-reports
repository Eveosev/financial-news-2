Montebalito SA (MTB) , a Spanish company
with investments in real estate and renewable energy, closed its
hotel unit and sought protection from creditors for the
division,  El Economista  reported, without saying how it got the
information.  The company has three months to renegotiate 360,000 euros
($519,000) of debt linked to the unit and will declare the
division bankrupt if no agreement is reached, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
