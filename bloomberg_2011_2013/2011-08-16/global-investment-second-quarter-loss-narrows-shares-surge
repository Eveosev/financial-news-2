Global Investment House KSCC (GLOBAL) ,
Kuwait’s biggest investment bank, said its second-quarter loss
narrowed as interest expenses and operating costs declined. The
shares surged the most in at least eight years.  The net loss in the second quarter was 16.7 million Kuwait
dinars ($61.3 million) compared with 20.3 million dinars a year
earlier, according to a company statement on the Kuwait bourse’s
website. The first-half loss was 38.7 million dinars compared
with 34.4 million dinars.  First-half principal investment losses of 28.2 million
dinars were largely due to 6.8 million dinars in losses from the
“share of results of associates” and the impact of political
unrest on regional equity markets and on Global’s holdings, the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  First-half interest costs fell 7 percent to 12 million
dinars from a year earlier on reduced levels of debt and
operating expenses declined 33 percent.  Global agreed with 53 creditors in December 2009 to alter
debt payments as part of a $1.73 billion debt restructuring. The
company said it repaid $19.7 million in principal in the first
half, bringing total repayments since the accord to $198
million, according to the statement.  The bank’s ability to meet future principal repayments
depends on its “ability to make exits from principal
investments, capital raising and resolution of legal disputes”
including a case with  National Bank of Umm Al Qaiwain (NBQ) , the
company added.  Global on April 25 said a Dubai court has ruled in its
favor in a $250 million dispute with National Bank of Umm Al
Qaiwain. The bank was ordered to pay the amount plus an interest
of $54.6 million, Global said. The execution awaits a final
ruling of Dubai’s Court of Cassation.  Global shares rose 13.5 percent at 12:04 p.m. in  Kuwait
City  today to 21 fils, heading for the biggest one-day surge
since at least June 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
