The  Asian Development Bank  and
 Islamic Development Bank  have agreed to help  Bangladesh  fund
$581 million in new power projects by June 2017.  The funding will help close a power deficit that is
expected to climb this year to 1,200 megawatts, about the
capacity of one nuclear plant, in a nation where 49 percent of
people don’t have access to electricity.  The Manila-based lender will provide a $300 million loan to
Bangladesh to build a new natural gas-fueled power station to
replace aging units at the country’s second-largest plant in
Ashuganj, according to a  statement  on ADB’s website.  The IDB, based in Jeddah,  Saudi Arabia , will provide $200
million and the Bangladesh government will contribute $81
million to the project, which will also build a 5-megawatt solar
photovoltaic plant, a hybrid renewable-energy project on Hatiya
island and retrofit streetlights with more efficient bulbs.  The ADB loan has a 25-year tenure with a grace period of 5
years and an  interest rate  determined by the bank’s Libor-based
lending facility, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
