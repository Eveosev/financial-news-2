Total SA (FP) â€™s Pazflor oil project in
 Angola  will export its first crude cargo in October, according
to a loading plan obtained by Bloomberg News.  The Pazflor field, located 150 kilometers offshore Angola,
will reach production plateau of 200,000 barrels a day and was
scheduled to begin operations in the fourth quarter, the Paris-
based company said in April.  Total is the operator of the field and holds a 40 percent
share. Statoil ASA has 23.33 percent, Exxon Mobil Corp. 20
percent and BP Plc 16.67 percent, Total said on its  website .  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
