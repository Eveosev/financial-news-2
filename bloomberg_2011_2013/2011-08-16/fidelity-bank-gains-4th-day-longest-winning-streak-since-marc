Fidelity Bank Plc (FIDELITY) , a Nigerian
lender, rose for a fourth day as investors speculated the  stock
trading  below its long-term average relative to the company’s
net assets remains attractive.  The stock gained 9 kobo, or 4.8 percent, to 1.98 naira at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. The four-day rally is the longest
winning streak since March 14. The shares are valued at 0.42
times book value, compared with a four-year average of 0.58,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fidelity fell as much as 28 percent since the end of June
to a record low of 1.67 naira on Aug. 10 as concern that the
global economy was faltering damped demand for riskier assets in
emerging markets.  A share price below 2 naira is “indicative of a hidden
value in the security, which investors are taking advantage of
now,” David Adonri, chief of Lambeth Trust and Investment Co.
Limited, a brokerage, said by phone from Lagos today. “The
stock is stable and investors have confidence in it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
