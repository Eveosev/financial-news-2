Arrow Energy Ltd. , the Australian
company acquired last year by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and
PetroChina Co., awarded an engineering and design contract for
its proposed liquefied natural gas project to  Chiyoda Corp. (6366) ,
 Saipem SpA (SPM)  and Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. NV.  The group that won the “multi-million dollar” contract
will carry out the design during the next 12 months, Brisbane-
based Arrow said today in an e-mailed statement. The LNG venture
on the coast of Australia’s Queensland state is expected
initially to have two processing units, each producing 4 million
metric tons of the fuel a year, Arrow said.  Arrow is seeking to follow BG Group Plc,  Santos Ltd. (STO)  and
ConocoPhillips in reaching a decision to proceed with a project
that will liquefy natural gas from coal deposits. The ventures
are among A$200 billion ($210 billion) of planned LNG projects
in Australia targeting rising Asian demand for the fuel.  Arrow expects an  investment decision  in late 2013, Chief
Executive Officer Andrew Faulkner said in June.  Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, is “quite happy” to
wait to develop the project, Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser 
told analysts last month. Recent approvals for rival projects
valued at about $50 billion may drive costs higher, he said.  The Arrow LNG project on  Curtis Island  may eventually have
four processing units producing as much as 16 million tons of
LNG annually, the company said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
