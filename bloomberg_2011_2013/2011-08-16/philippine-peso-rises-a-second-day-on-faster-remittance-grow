The Philippine peso climbed for a
second day after growth in remittances, equivalent to almost 10
percent of gross domestic product, quickened in June.  Cash transfers from Filipinos working overseas increased 7
percent, the fastest pace in five months, to $1.74 billion in
June from a year earlier, the central bank reported yesterday.
The currency also gained on speculation that President  Benigno
Aquino ’s proposal to peg tobacco and liquor taxes to inflation,
if accepted by lawmakers, will help boost government revenue.  “The fiscal and financial management under this
administration is going in the right direction, which helps
boost confidence,” said Marcelo Ayes, senior vice president at
Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in  Manila . “Remittance data was
strong, showing resiliency.”  The peso advanced 0.2 percent to 42.31 per dollar at 10:39
a.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The yield on
the 7 percent bonds due March 2017 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.08 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services.  The Bureau of the Treasury will auction 9 billion pesos
($213 million) of new bonds due August 2018 at 1 p.m. today.  President Aquino will endorse  birth control  and pegging
tobacco and liquor taxes to inflation as among 13 measures he
wants the Congress to prioritize, his spokesman Edwin Lacierda
said by phone today. Aquino will meet with lawmakers today.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
