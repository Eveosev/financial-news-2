Somali President Sheikh Sharif
Sheikh Ahmed asked Burundi to send more soldiers to bolster an
African Union peacekeeping force in the Horn of Africa country,
Xinhua reported.  Sheikh Sharif met Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza
yesterday in Bujumbura, the Burundian capital, to discuss the
withdrawal earlier this month by al-Shabaab from the Somali
capital, Mogadishu, it said.  Burundi has sent five battalions of soldiers to Somalia
since 2007, Xinhua said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
