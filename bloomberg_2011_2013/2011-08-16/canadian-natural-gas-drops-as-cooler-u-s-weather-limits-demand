Canadian natural gas fell for a
third day as normal temperatures were forecast for the U.S.
Midwest and Northeast for the rest of the month, trimming demand
for the power-plant fuel.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , dropped 1.7
percent as MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland,
forecast most of the U.S. East aside from parts of the South
will have seasonal-to-cool weather at least until Aug. 30.  “The weather is pretty calm everywhere, cool, not so much
intense heat, and that looks like a lot less demand,” Michael Rose, director of trading at Angus Jackson Inc. in  Fort
Lauderdale , Florida, said in a telephone interview. “An absence
of weather and an absence of demand just makes prices go
lower.”  Alberta  gas for September delivery declined 5.75 cents to
C$3.36 per gigajoule ($3.25 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:10 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. October gas fell 6.75 cents to C$3.3575. Gas
traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and
is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  In New York, natural gas for September delivery fell 9.2
cents to settle at $3.932 per million Btu.  The high in Boston today may reach 72 degrees Fahrenheit
(22 Celsius), 8 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of
 State College , Pennsylvania.  Gas Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.4 billion cubic
feet as of 2 p.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.66 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.82 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.25 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.51 billion cubic feet today, about 55
percent of its capacity of 2.58 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
gained 1.13 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $4.1036 per million Btu as
of 3 p.m. New York time on the  Intercontinental Exchange .
Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic
feet a day to the Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 0.97 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $3.8094.  To contact the reporter on this story:
