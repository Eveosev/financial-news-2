U.S. Gulf oil premiums were mixed
after the discount of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to
Brent increased.  The gap widened 79 cents to $22.82 a barrel, below the Aug.
10 record of $23.79. When Brent increases versus WTI, it
strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete
with West African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 50 cents to $21 a
barrel at 3:29 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 10 cents to $24.20 a
barrel over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 15 cents to $19.75 while Poseidon’s gained 15 cents
to $19.50 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $18 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour gained 12 cents to 75 cents
below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium slipped 35 cents to
$23.90.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $14.25 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 40 cents to
$13.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
