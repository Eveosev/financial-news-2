Malaysia ’s ringgit advanced for a
sixth day, the longest winning streak since April, on
speculation policy makers will favor a stronger currency or
raise  interest rates  to stem gains in living costs.  Government data tomorrow are expected to show inflation
held at a two-year high of 3.5 percent in July and the economy
expanded in the second quarter at the slowest pace since a
recession ended in 2009, according to the median estimates of
economists in Bloomberg surveys. Global equities rallied
yesterday after the U.S. reported the biggest gain in retail
sales in four months.  “Asian currencies are higher because of rising risk
appetite following better data from the U.S.,” said Akira
Banno, a treasury adviser in  Kuala Lumpur  at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. “In Malaysia, second-quarter growth of 3
percent to 4 percent is acceptable to market players and there
is a possibility the central bank will raise policy rates if
inflation remains high.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.9793 per dollar
as of 4:36 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose 0.7 percent yesterday.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 2.2 percent in  New
York  yesterday, capping its biggest three-day gain since 2009,
after the U.S. Commerce Department reported on Aug. 12 that
retail sales increased 0.5 percent in July.  Gross domestic product in Malaysia expanded 3.6 percent in
the three months through June from a year earlier, according to
the median estimate of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
That would be a slowdown after a 4.6 percent expansion in the
first quarter, The central bank is scheduled to release the
economic report at 6 p.m tomorrow.  Bank Negara Malaysia  has raised borrowing costs only once
this year to 3 percent after three increases in 2010. Rates
remain “quite low,” Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said on July 18.  Malaysian  government bonds  rose. The yield on the 4.262
percent note due September 2016 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.41 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
