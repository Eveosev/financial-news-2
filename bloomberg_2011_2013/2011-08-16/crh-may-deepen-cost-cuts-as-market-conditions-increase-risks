CRH Plc (CRH) , the world’s second-largest
building-materials maker, said it will continue to review cost-
cutting opportunities as market conditions deteriorate.  The Irish supplier of asphalt, concrete products and
crushed rock eliminated about 15 percent of its workforce last
year as construction demand was slow to recover in developed
nations. CRH’s cost-cutting plan is expected to generate savings
of 136 million euros ($195 million) in 2011, the Dublin-based
company said in a statement today. CRH started its five-year
savings program in 2007.  Recent downward revisions to economic growth estimates and
turbulence in financial markets “have added to market risks and
uncertainties” in the second half, Chief Executive Officer
Myles Lee said in the statement.  First-half net income rose to 76 million euros from 18
million euros, beating the 53.1 million-euro estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales increased 7 percent to
8.16 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
