Tanzania, a natural gas producer,
has granted  Total SA (FP)  the rights to search for oil and gas in the
country’s Lake Tanganyika North Area, the East African nation’s
state-owned oil company said.  Paris-based Total has been invited to negotiate a
production-sharing agreement to complete the licensing process,
 Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. , based in the commercial
capital of Dar es Salaam, said in a statement on its website
today.  Total E&P Activites Petrolieres, the company’s upstream
unit, demonstrated it had “superior” technical knowledge and
better financial capability than eight other bidders to carry
out the exploration program, it said.  “Total E&P has shown to be able to comply with the minimum
work commitment,” TPDC said.  London-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , Establissements Maurel & Prom
SA of France and Dominion Petroleum Ltd. in  London  are also
licensed oil and gas explorers in Tanzania, according to TPDC’s
website.  Tanzania’s proven gas reserves are 7.5 trillion cubic feet,
according to the  East African Community , a regional trade bloc.
