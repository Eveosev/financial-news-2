John Menzies Plc (MNZS) , a U.K. newspaper
and magazine distributor and handler of cargo at airports
including London’s Heathrow, said first-half profit rose on
contract gains in its aviation division.  Net income for the six months to June 30 increased to 16.3
million pounds ($27 million), compared with 14.8 million pounds
a year earlier, the Edinburgh-based company said today in a
statement distributed by the Regulatory News Service.  “Menzies Aviation continues to prosper and for the first
time was the larger profit contributor,” Chairman Iain Napier
said in the statement. “Menzies Distribution continues to
perform robustly. Although profit was behind last year this was
attributable to the benefit received in 2010 from World Cup
collectables.”  Excluding the World Cup effect, the distribution business
was little changed, Napier said. The aviation business also
benefited from a reversal of the financial loss caused by
Iceland’s volcanic ash cloud in April 2010, he said.  The company accounts for around 45 percent of the newspaper
and magazine wholesale distribution market in the U.K.,
according to the statement. Its aviation division handles cargo
for more than 500 airlines in 127 locations worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
