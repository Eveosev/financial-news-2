Home prices  in the San Francisco Bay
Area declined 7 percent in July from a year earlier as buyers of
high-end properties stayed on the sidelines,  DataQuick  said.  The median price paid in the nine-county region fell to
$374,000 from $402,000 in July 2010, the San Diego-based
property-research firm said today in a statement. Prices were
down 1 percent from June.  “There was a lot of uncertainty out there over the
economy, home prices and the nation’s future,” DataQuick
President  John Walsh  said in the statement. “And that was
before the stock market turbulence hit in early August.”  A total of 6,887 houses and condominiums sold in the Bay
Area in July, down 14 percent from the previous month and up 1.7
percent from a year earlier, the company said. Transactions
involving homes priced at $500,000 or more decreased 25 percent
from June and 19 percent from July 2010, while foreclosures and
short sales, where a property sells for less than the amount
owed, accounted for almost half of all deals.  All nine counties showed price declines from a year
earlier, with Napa falling the most, 23 percent, to a median
$281,000.  San Francisco  prices dropped 0.2 percent to $675,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
