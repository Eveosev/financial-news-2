Zimbabwe â€™s cabinet approved the
formation of a state-owned mining company to be known as the
Zimbabwe Mineral Exploration Corp., the state-controlled  Herald 
said, citing Deputy Mines Minister Gift Chimanikire.  Once the attorney-general has drafted laws needed to
establish the company, the government will seek companies to
partner the state-owned operator to cushion it from the costs of
exploration, the Harare-based newspaper cited Chimanikire as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
