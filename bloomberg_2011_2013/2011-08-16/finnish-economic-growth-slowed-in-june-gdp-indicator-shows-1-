Finland’s economic growth slowed in
June, an output indicator showed, as policy makers in the
northernmost euro member tackle sluggish export markets amid
weakening global recovery prospects.  Gross domestic product expanded an annual 2.5 percent in
June, down from a revised 4.8 percent in May, Helsinki-based
 Statistics Finland  said on its website today, citing the trend
indicator for the country’s output data.  Growth is slowing as inflation accelerates beyond the
 European Central Bank ’s 2 percent target. Finnish prices grew an
annual 4 percent in July, the fastest pace since the global
crisis peaked in October 2008, the statistics office said
yesterday. Finland’s price measure includes  house prices  and
borrowing costs.  Finland is one of six AAA rated nations in the 17-member
euro area. The Nordic country’s economy grew an annual 4.9
percent in the first quarter after expanding 5.6 percent in
final three months of 2010, the office estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
