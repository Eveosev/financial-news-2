Romania ’s economic recovery slowed
in the second quarter as  Europe ’s debt crisis damped western
demand for its manufactured products.  Gross domestic product grew for a second quarter, expanding
an unadjusted 1.4 percent from a year earlier compared with a
1.7 percent rise in the first three months, the  National
Statistics Institute  in Bucharest said today in an e-mailed
statement. The figure exceeded the 1.3 percent median estimate
from four economists in a Bloomberg survey. The economy grew an
adjusted 0.2 percent from the previous quarter.  Romania’s export-driven economy is counting on western
European demand for its goods, including Dacia SA cars, to
support a recovery from the worst recession on record. An
unexpected fall in European industrial production in June added
to signs the 17-nation euro-area economy is losing momentum as
governments struggle to contain a debt crisis.  The  International Monetary Fund  and European Union expect
Romania’s economy to grow 1.5 percent in 2011 after shrinking
1.3 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
