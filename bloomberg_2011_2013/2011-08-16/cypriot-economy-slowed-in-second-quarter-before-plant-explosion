Cyprus’s economy expanded at its
slowest pace in a year in the second quarter, before a power-
plant explosion further damped the island’s growth prospects.  Gross domestic product rose 1.4 percent on a seasonally
adjusted basis from a year earlier, down from 1.6 percent in the
previous three months, the Nicosia-based Cyprus Statistics
Service said in a statement on its  website  today. GDP increased
0.4 percent from the first quarter.  The July 11 explosion knocked out more than half of the
east Mediterranean island’s electricity-generating capacity,
leading to a political crisis and increasing the likelihood
Cyprus may become the fourth European Union country to require a
bailout. Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings all downgraded Cyprus’s credit rating after the blast on
concern about the budget gap. The 2011 deficit may reach 6.5
percent of GDP, Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias said on Aug. 10.  Moody’s predicted Cyprus’s economy won’t grow at all this
year and will expand by 1 percent in 2012. Before the explosion
at a munitions dump that destroyed the 767-megawatt Vasilikos
power station, the government had forecast the economy would
grow 1.5 percent in 2011.  The annual growth rate in the three months through June was
the slowest since the same quarter of 2010, when GDP expanded
0.7 percent following four quarters of contraction. GDP rose 1.5
percent on a non-seasonally adjusted basis in the second quarter
from a year earlier, the statistics service said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
