An Argentine judge is allowing the
local unit of  Ternium SA (TX) , Latin America’s second-largest
steelmaker, to pay a disputed 1.5 billion-peso ($363 million)
dividend. The stock climbed the most in four months.  Federal Judge Hernan Papa notified  Siderar SAIC (ERAR) , as the
unit is known, yesterday that it could make the payment, Siderar
said today in a filing with Argentina’s securities regulator.
The dividend will be paid to shareholders on Sept. 2.  Judge Papa blocked the dividend payment on May 5 amid a
legal dispute between Siderar and the government’s pensions
agency, known as Anses, which owns a 26 percent stake in the
steelmaker. The dispute ended last month when Siderar and Anses
agreed on the number of government representatives for Siderar’s
board. Anses named three of the board’s 11-members on July 21.  Siderar rose 5.9 percent to 32.20 pesos at 12:52 p.m. in
trading on  Buenos Aires ’ Merval exchange. Earlier, the stock
rose as much as 9.1 percent, the most since April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
