Copper declined on speculation that
a moderating Chinese economy and sluggish U.S. recovery may damp
demand for the metal in the world’s two largest users.  Three-month copper on the  London  Metal Exchange fell as
much as 0.7 percent to $8,850.25 per metric ton, and was at
$8,852 at 2:36 p.m. in Shanghai. The metal for December delivery
on the Comex lost 0.9 percent to $4.0185 per pound.  China  is “significantly moderating,” Bart van Ark, The
Conference Board’s chief economist, told Bloomberg Television
from  New York  today. The Conference Board Leading Economic Index
for China has slowed “quite significantly” over the past few
months, van Ark said. The gauge rose 1 percent to 158.9 in June,
according to data from the New York-based research organization.  “Copper’s fundamentals are not bad, but uncertainties over
the  U.S. economy  and European debt problems are curbing a
further rally,” Xiao Wei, an analyst at Industrial Futures Co.,
said by phone from  Shanghai .  Copper for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 1.2 percent to 66,500 yuan ($10,413) a ton.  Reports later today may show U.S. builders broke ground on
600,000 homes at an annual rate in July, a 4.6 percent drop from
June, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
77 economists. Building permits, a sign of future construction,
probably fell 1.9 percent. Euro-zone economic growth dropped to
1.8 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, the slowest
expansion in more than a year, another survey showed.  Lead in London fell 0.8 percent to $2,378.25 a ton, while
zinc retreated 0.6 percent to $2,170 per ton. Aluminum was
little changed at $2,376 per ton, nickel climbed 0.2 percent to
$21,350 per ton, and tin advanced 0.2 percent to $24,500 per
ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
