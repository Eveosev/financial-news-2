Chilean President Sebastian Pinera
and his Colombian counterpart,  Juan Manuel Santos , agreed to
increase integration of their financial markets today in
response to global market volatility.  The leaders have asked their finance ministries to include
financial services in an existing free-trade agreement between
South America’s fourth- and fifth-largest economies, Pinera told
reporters in Santiago without providing additional details on
the measure.  The agreement is part of a series of accords the two
presidents signed that included steps to expand trade relations,
fight drugs and integrate  Latin America , Pinera said.
Integrating financial markets will help the countries withstand
volatility in global markets, Santos told reporters.  “International turbulence in financial and economic areas
increasingly obligates us to work and coordinate our policies,”
Santos said. “The world wants to see countries with stability
and countries with projections for the future.”  Chile’s benchmark stock index, the IPSA Index, has declined
4.9 percent so far this month, while  Colombia ’s IGBC Index has
slipped 4.2 percent over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
