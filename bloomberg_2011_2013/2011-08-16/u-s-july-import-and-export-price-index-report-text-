The following is the text of the
U.S. import and export price index report from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.  U.S. IMPORT AND EXPORT PRICE INDEXES -  JULY 2011  U.S. import prices increased 0.3 percent in July, the  U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today, after declining 0.6
percent the previous month. Rising prices for both fuel and
nonfuel imports contributed to the overall increase. In
contrast, U.S. export prices fell 0.4 percent in July, the
first decrease since the index declined 0.2 percent in July
2010.  Imports  All Imports: Import prices increased 0.3 percent in July,
following a 0.6 percent decline in June. Over the past three
months, import prices edged down 0.1 percent, after increasing
13.7 percent in the seven months prior to May. Import prices
rose 14.0 percent for the year ended in July, the largest 12-
month advance since the index increased 18.1 percent for the
year ended in August 2008. Higher prices for both fuel and
nonfuel imports contributed to the increase over the past 12
months.  Fuel Imports: Fuel prices advanced 0.4 percent in July,
following a 2.1 percent decline in June. Rising prices for
petroleum, which increased 0.6 percent, contributed the most
to the July advance. Fuel prices rose 45.5 percent for the
year ended in July, led by a 48.9 percent increase in
petroleum prices over the same period. In contrast, natural
 gas prices  declined 3.6 percent in July and fell 0.9 percent
over the past year.  All Imports Excluding Fuel: The price index for imports
excluding fuel increased 0.2 percent in July, following a 0.1
percent decline in June. Higher prices for consumer goods as
well as nonfuel industrial supplies and materials, up 0.4
percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, were the principal
contributors to the increase in nonfuel prices. Prices for
nonfuel imports increased 5.5 percent over the past 12 months,
the largest year-over-year rise since a 6.1 percent advance
between September 2007 and September 2008. In contrast,
automotive vehicle prices declined 0.3 percent in July, while
prices for capital goods remained unchanged.  Exports  All Exports: Export prices declined in July, falling 0.4
percent following a 0.1 percent uptick in June.  The drop in
July was the first decrease since the index fell 0.2 percent
in July 2010. The downturn was led by a decline in the price
index for agricultural commodities, which was partially offset
by an advance in nonagricultural prices. Export prices rose
9.8 percent over the past 12 months, down from the 10.1
percent change for the year ended in June, which was the
largest year-over-year increase in export prices since a 10.2
percent advance between July 2007 and July 2008.  Agricultural Exports: The price index for agricultural exports
fell 4.3 percent in July, the largest decrease since a 4.9
percent decline in July 2009. Falling prices for cotton, corn,
wheat, and soybeans, down 13.5 percent, 11.5 percent, 17.9
percent, and 4.4 percent, respectively, all contributed to the
overall decline. Despite decreasing in three of the last four
months, the index advanced 25.9 percent for the year ended in
July.  All Exports Excluding Agriculture: Nonagricultural prices rose
0.2 percent in July after a 0.1 percent increase in June.
Higher  consumer goods  prices and prices for automotive
vehicles each contributed to the overall increase in
nonagricultural prices in July. Over the past year, the index
for nonagricultural prices rose 8.3 percent, the largest 12-
month increase since the index was first published in 1985.  SELECTED JULY HIGHLIGHTS  Import Prices  Nonfuel Industrial Supplies and Materials: The price index for
industrial supplies and materials excluding fuels increased
0.7 percent in July following a 0.4 percent decrease in June.
Higher prices for fertilizers and other chemicals were the
largest contributors to the increase. Over the past 12 months,
the index rose 16.3 percent.  Finished Goods: Finished goods prices were mixed in July.
Prices for consumer goods increased 0.4 percent, automotive
vehicle prices fell 0.3 percent, and the price index for
capital goods remained unchanged. Higher prices for cotton
apparel and diamonds, which increased 1.8 percent and 4.2
percent, respectively, drove the advance in the price index
for consumer goods. Falling prices for transport vehicles,
down 4.5 percent in July, led the decline in the price index
for automotive vehicles.  Foods, Feeds, and Beverages: Foods, feeds, and beverages
prices increased 0.5 percent in July following a 1.7 percent
decline in June. The increase was driven by rising prices for
fish and shellfish and green coffee, which increased 2.0
percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.  Imports by Locality of Origin: The price index for imports
from  China  advanced 0.4 percent in July following a 0.2
percent increase in June. Over the past year, import prices

advance since the index rose 4.3 percent for the year ended
October 2008.  In contrast, import prices from  Japan  fell 0.3
percent, the largest decline since a 0.6 percent decrease in
September 2008.  Transportation Services: Import air passenger fares edged down
0.1 percent in July. A 5.0 percent decline in European air
fares was partially offset by a 6.1 percent gain in Latin
America/Caribbean air fares.  Import air freight prices fell
0.2 percent in July.  Export Prices  Nonagricultural Industrial Supplies and Materials:
Nonagricultural industrial supplies and materials prices fell
0.2 percent in July, following a 0.6 percent downturn in June.
A 10.2 percent drop in prices for steelmaking materials led to
the overall decrease; a 2.3 percent decline in plastic prices
was also a contributing factor.  Finished Goods: The price indexes for consumer goods and for
automotive vehicles both increased in July. The 0.6 percent
increase in consumer goods was highlighted by rising prices
for medicinal, dental, and pharmaceutical materials, which
increased 0.6 percent. Automotive vehicle prices rose 0.5
percent in July, led by a 0.7 percent increase in parts
prices. Capital goods prices were unchanged in July.  Transportation Services: The index for export air passenger
fares advanced 8.1 percent in July, driven by an 11.3 percent
increase in European fares and an 8.8 percent increase in
Asian fares. Over the past 12 months, the index for export air
passenger fares rose 8.6 percent. Export air freight prices
fell 0.8 percent in July after edging down 0.1 percent in
