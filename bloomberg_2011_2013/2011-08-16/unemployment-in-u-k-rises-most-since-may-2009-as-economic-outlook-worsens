Britain’s coalition government will
go ahead with index-linked rail-fare increases that were boosted
by unexpectedly high inflation, Transport Minister Theresa
Villiers said today.  The price rise, which will average 8 percent for regulated
fares, is vital if Britain is to fund 2,700 new railcars and
projects such as Crossrail and the Thameslink upgrade in  London ,
Villiers said on BBC Radio 4’s Today program.  More people are forecast to travel by rail even after the
fare hike, which was triggered by a higher-than-predicted
inflation rate, she said, adding that an improvement in
efficiency is what’s required to rein in ticket prices.  “The real solution is that we need to get the cost of
running the railways down,” she said. “I think it’s essential
that we deliver these cost savings.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
