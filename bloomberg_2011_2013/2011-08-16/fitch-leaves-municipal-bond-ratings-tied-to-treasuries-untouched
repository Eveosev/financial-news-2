Fitch Ratings  left unchanged the
ratings of municipal bonds tied to the creditworthiness of the
U.S.  The New York-based firm announced today that it has
maintained its AAA rating, the firm’s highest, on  U.S.
government debt .  Rival Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S. to AA+, its
second-highest level, on Aug. 5. Three days later the company
similarly lowered its ratings on 11,500 municipal credits whose
finances are tied to that of the nation.  Cindy Stoller, a spokeswoman for Fitch, didn’t immediately
respond to a telephone call seeking comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
