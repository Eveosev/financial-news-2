The hottest weather in the U.S. will
probably center on the South and Rocky Mountain states through
the end of the month,  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity
Weather Group LLC. said.  The strongest concentrations of heat will be centered on
Texas and Idaho, according to Rogers’ 6- to 10-day and 11- to
15- day forecasts. The Great Lakes and the U.S. Northeast are
expected to be seasonal during this time frame and that will
impact energy usage in those areas.  “The Midwest and East continue to be too variable to
maintain significant high demand levels,” Rogers said.  Natural gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
if temperatures may boost heating or cooling needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
