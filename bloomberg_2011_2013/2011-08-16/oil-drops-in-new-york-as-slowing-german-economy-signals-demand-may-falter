Crude oil dropped, bring its decline
this month to 9.5 percent, after Germany’s economy almost
stalled in the second quarter, bolstering concern that fuel
consumption will diminish.  Futures fell 1.4 percent after Germany’s  Federal Statistics
Office  said gross domestic product rose 0.1 percent from the
first quarter. European economic growth slowed during the period
as the sovereign-debt crisis worsened. French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said today that his nation and Germany will propose a
financial transaction tax for the region.  “The disappointing German GDP number is responsible for
the bulk of the sell-off we’ve seen today,” said  Phil Flynn ,
vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “Germany was
expected to carry the entire euro-zone and now its economy
appears to be faltering.”  Crude oil for September delivery declined $1.23 to settle
at $86.65 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
have dropped 5.2 percent this year.  Prices pared declines after the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude supplies rose
1.75 million barrels to 350.4 million. September oil was down 86
cents at $87.02 a barrel at 4:32 p.m. in electronic trading.  Brent oil for September settlement fell 44 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $109.47 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe in  London . The September contract expired today.
October oil dropped 71 cents to $109.13.  The front-month contract of the European benchmark was at a
$22.82 a barrel premium to U.S. futures, compared with a record
$23.79 on Aug. 10, based on closing prices.  U.S. Manufacturing  Oil rebounded from the day’s low of $85.62 after data
showed that U.S. manufacturers churned out more cars, computers
and furniture in July. The 0.9 percent gain in output at
factories, mines and utilities was almost twice the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the
biggest gain of the year, Federal Reserve figures showed.  Economists had forecast German growth of 0.5 percent,
according to the median of 33 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. GDP for the first three months of the year was revised
from 1.5 percent to 1.3 percent by the Wiesbaden-based
statistics office. Germany is  Europe ’s largest economy and the
world’s seventh-biggest oil-consuming country.  Futures dropped “on concerns about the euro-zone,” said
 Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in
New York. “The economic weakness raises concerns about the
global demand picture.”  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.2
percent from the first quarter, when it increased 0.8 percent,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the worst performance since the region emerged from a
recession in late 2009. Economists forecast the economy would
expand 0.3 percent, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Financial Transaction Tax  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  met the French President
today in Paris. The two countries will propose the financial
transaction tax in September, Sarkozy said after the talks. They
also proposed European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  to head
a “euro council,” he told reporters today.  “The overall picture is that worldwide economic activity
is slowing down a bit, and, of course, that’s bearish for oil,”
said  Sintje Diek , an analyst at  HSH Nordbank  in Hamburg, who
correctly predicted that Brent prices would fall to $100 this
summer. “There are fears the recovery in the  euro zone  will be
very sluggish because of the debt crisis. Maybe we’ll see lower
prices than $100.”  Housing Starts  U.S. housing starts fell 1.5 percent to a 604,000 annual
rate last month, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . June’s 613,000 pace was less than previously
estimated, according to the department. Building permits, a
proxy for future construction, also dropped.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1 percent to
1,192.76 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.7 percent
to 11,405.93. The dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.4408 against the
euro from $1.4445 yesterday. A stronger U.S. currency reduces
the appeal of dollar-denominated raw materials as an investment.  Growth in  China , the world’s second-biggest oil consumer,
is “significantly moderating,” the Conference Board, a New
York-based research organization, said today. The nation’s
expansion may cool to 9.2 percent in the third quarter from 9.5
percent in the previous three months, the China Securities
Journal reported today, citing the State Information Center.  The U.S., China and the European Union were responsible for
48 percent of global oil demand in 2010, according to BP Plc’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  “The economic news is still bearing down on this market
and driving prices lower,” said  Rick Mueller , a principal with
ESAI Energy, LLC in Wakefield, Massachusetts. “We still don’t
know how much the economy will slow and what that will mean for
oil demand.”  U.S. Stockpiles  An Energy Department report tomorrow may show U.S. crude
supplies fell as imports decreased and refineries ran near the
highest rates of the year, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Inventories dropped 500,000 barrels to 349.3 million last week,
the lowest level since March 4, according to the median of 16
analyst estimates in the survey. Gasoline stockpiles fell 1.18
million barrels, according to the survey.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 676,535
contracts as of 3:35 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 587,209
contracts yesterday, 14 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.56 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
