Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  as corn advanced while gasoline fell.  Futures were steady on speculation hot weather that
blanketed the corn-rich Midwest last month hindered crop
development for the grain and biofuel feedstock. Gasoline, with
which ethanol is blended, slipped on concern that fuel demand is
faltering.  “It’s just one of those fairly quiet days,” said Will
Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk Management in Galena,
 Illinois . “It’s just calming down from the huge volatility
we’ve seen in energy, kind of waiting and seeing.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery climbed 0.2 cent to
$2.797 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures are up 18
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  rose 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.905 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel
increased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.815, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 0.5 cent to $2.925 a gallon
and on the West Coast the fuel advanced 0.5 cent to $2.98.  Gasoline for September delivery slumped 2.07 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $2.8538 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 7.5 cents, or 1
percent, to $7.275 a bushel in Chicago Board of Trade. One
bushel distills into at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
