Nintendo Co. weekly 3DS handheld
video game player sales in  Japan  climbed to the second-highest
since the product’s debut as the company cut prices 40 percent,
research firm Enterbrain Inc. said.  Nintendo sold 214,821 3DS units in Japan last week, the
most since 371,326 units in the last week of February, when the
3DS was introduced, the Tokyo-based researcher said in a
statement today. Nintendo cut the price of the 3DS to 15,000 yen
($195) on Aug. 11 from 25,000 yen.  The maker of Wii consoles and games and DS handheld players
cut its profit forecast 82 percent last month as demand for the
3DS was less than it had expected. The Aug. 11 cut is the first
time the Kyoto-based company has lowered a product’s price
within six months of its debut.  The company shipped 3.61 million units worldwide by the end
of March and 710,000 units in the three months ended June 30.  Nintendo fell 2.3 percent to 11,700 yen at the 3:10 p.m.
close of trading in Osaka trading. The stock has declined 51
percent this year, compared with a 14 percent drop in the MSCI
Japan Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
