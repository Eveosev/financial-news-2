A higher percentage of hopefuls for
the Chartered Financial Analyst designation passed the third
level of their three-part exam in June compared with a year
earlier.  Fifty-one percent of applicants succeeded, the  CFA
Institute  said on its  website  today, up from 46 percent on the
June 2010 exam. The group said last month that 39 percent passed
Level 1 and 43 percent passed the second exam.  A record 144,900 candidates registered to take the three
CFA exams in June, aiming to gain a hiring edge after the number
of U.S. financial-industry jobs dropped for four straight years.
Applicants take the test hoping the certification can lead to
better jobs, higher salaries and a deeper understanding of
finance.  Almost 27,000 applicants registered for the third test,
while about 22,800 sat for the exam, according to an e-mail from
the CFA Institute.  Successful charter recipients spend an average of 300 hours
preparing for each exam and typically take four years to
complete all three tests, according to the not-for-profit
institute. Candidates must have at least four yearsâ€™
professional experience in the investment industry to receive
the designation.  The institute formed in 1990 with the merger of the
Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts and the Financial
Analysts Federation. The CFA program, previously administered by
the ICFA, started in 1963 with 284 applicants. It stems in part
from  Benjamin Graham , a pioneer of  value investing  who mentored
 Warren Buffett  and advocated a rating system for financial
analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
