Most European stocks fell, with the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index snapping its biggest three-day rally
since May 2010, as the economies of the euro area and  Germany 
grew at a slower-than-estimated pace.  Terna Rete Elettrica Nazionale SpA (TRN)  retreated 14 percent as
investors speculated that taxes will lessen the Italian power-
grid operator’s earnings.  Enel SpA (ENEL) ,  Italy ’s largest power
producer, decreased 4.3 percent.  Severn Trent Plc (SVT) ,  Pennon Group
Plc (PNN)  and  United Utilities Group Plc (UU/)  declined more than 1 percent
as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended selling the shares of
the U.K. utilities.  The benchmark Stoxx 600 slid 0.1 percent to 237.56 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London as three stocks dropped for every one
that climbed. The gauge has tumbled 18 percent since this year’s
high on Feb. 17 amid concern that global economic growth is
faltering.  “Macro surprises for the euro zone and the U.S. do not
show convincing signs of a bottom,” wrote Bernd Meyer, the head
of cross-asset strategy at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , in a
report. “One should only add to risk assets if the macro
outlook stabilizes.”  Stocks recouped some losses as  Fitch Ratings  affirmed its
AAA credit rating on the U.S. and industrial production in the
world’s largest economy climbed in July by the most this year  National benchmark indexes dropped in 13 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index climbed 0.1 percent
and France’s CAC 40 Index slid 0.3 percent, while Germany’s DAX
Index sank 0.5 percent.  Euro-Area Economy  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.2
percent from the first quarter, when it increased 0.8 percent,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said in a
statement today. That’s the worst performance since the euro
region emerged from a recession in late 2009. Economists had
forecast the economy to expand 0.3 percent, according to the
median of 34 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Germany’s economy,  Europe ’s largest, almost stalled in the
second quarter. Gross domestic product, adjusted for seasonal
effects, climbed 0.1 percent from the first quarter, when it
jumped a revised 1.3 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today. Economists had predicted growth of 0.5
percent, according to the median of 33 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The Stoxx 600 had rallied 6.4 percent over the past three
days after a global equity rout left stocks trading at their
cheapest valuation since March 2009 amid concern the economic
recovery is stalling. The gauge traded at 9.8 times the
estimated earnings of its companies, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That compares with the average multiple of 12.2
over the past five years.  Warren Buffett  Buys  Billionaire investor Warren Buffett used the slump to buy
stocks. His Berkshire Hathaway Inc. made its biggest bets on the
stock market this year on Aug. 8 as the  S&P 500  plunged the most
since December 2008.  “I like buying on sale,” Buffett, Berkshire’s chief
executive officer and head of investments, said in a television
interview with  Charlie Rose  to be broadcast on PBS. “Last
Monday, we spent more money in the stock market buying than any
day this year.”  Asset allocations in equities fell by the most on record
this month as a “gloomy” outlook for economic growth prompted
investors to pile into cash, a BofA Merrill Lynch Global
Research survey showed.  Terna, Enel, Snam  Utilities shares slid 2 percent, for the biggest decline
among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Terna plunged 14 percent to 2.49 euros, its largest drop
since 2004, and Enel slid 4.3 percent to 3.47 euros.  Snam Rete
Gas SpA (SRG) , the owner of Italy’s natural-gas grid, tumbled 9.9
percent to 3.33 euros.  Italy approved a law at the weekend that increased the tax
on power generators to 10.5 percent from 6.5 percent and
extended the levy to distribution and transmission companies.
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s government will get 1.8
billion euros ($2.6 billion) in 2012 and 900 million euros in
the following two years from the tax changes, according to
UniCredit SpA.  Severn Trent retreated 2.2 percent to 1,461 pence after the
company was downgraded to “sell” from “neutral” at Goldman
Sachs. The brokerage also cut Pennon, which fell 2 percent to
655 pence, and United Utilities, which slipped 1.1 percent to
592.5 pence, to “sell.”  Intercell, Lundin Petroleum  Intercell AG (ICLL)  surged 20 percent to 3 euros as the Austrian
vaccine maker said its second-quarter loss narrowed to 1.6
million euros from 8.35 million euros a year earlier. That beat
the average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for
a loss of 8.7 million euros.  Lundin Petroleum AB (LUPE)  rallied 13 percent to 90.30 kronor.
 Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s biggest oil and gas producer, said that
two North Sea discoveries hold as much as 1.2 billion barrels of
recoverable oil in total, which would make them the country’s
largest oil find since the 1980s. Aldous-Avaldsnes is located
west of Lundin’s Avaldsnes find.  “It’s probably the largest offshore oil discovery anywhere
in the world this year,” Tim Dodson, Statoil’s executive vice
president for exploration, said in an Oslo interview.  Statoil’s shares gained 2.9 percent to 126.10 kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
