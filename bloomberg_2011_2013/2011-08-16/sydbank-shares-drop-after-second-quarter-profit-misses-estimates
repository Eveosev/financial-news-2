Sydbank A/S, Denmark’s third-largest
publicly traded lender, fell as much as 9.8 percent in
Copenhagen after second-quarter profit missed analyst estimates.  The shares were down 6.8 percent at 106.5 kroner at 4:50
p.m. in Copenhagen, the biggest loser on the country’s benchmark
 OMX Copenhagen 20 index (KFX) , which was down 1.4 percent.  The lender said second-quarter net income fell to 5 million
kroner ($967,000) from 82 million kroner in the year-earlier
period after it paid 63 million kroner into a government fund to
rescue competitors Amagerbanken A/S and Fjordbank Mors A/S.
Analysts had expected Sydbank to post a second-quarter profit of
157 million kroner, according to the average estimate of seven
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Sydbank’s report for the second quarter was far short of
expectations,” Christian Hede, an analyst at Jyske Bank A/S
with a “strong buy” rating on the shares, said in an e-mail.  Trading income during the period slipped to 235 million
kroner from 327 million kroner the year-earlier period.  Sydbank said it still expects to report core earnings
before impairment charges for loans and advances of between 1.7
billion kroner and 2 billion kroner this year. The lender said
there is “greater uncertainty” about the company’s trading
income because of the deterioration of the Danish economy.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
