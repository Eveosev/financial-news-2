BP Shipping Ltd., the world’s
second-largest charterer of tankers, said it lost $143.6 million
in 2010 because of “challenging market conditions” and lower
hire costs for tankers.  The privately-held shipping division of  BP Plc (BP)  reported the
loss on turnover of $1.27 billion for the year ended Dec. 31,
2010, according to its annual report and accounts filed on June
29 to  Companies House , the U.K. government company register. BP
Shipping reported a loss of $309 million in 2009, the report
said.  “BP Shipping charters its vessels at market rates and its
accounts reflect the fall in freight rates, starting towards the
end of 2008,”  Adam Smith , a BP Shipping spokesman, said Aug. 15
in an e-mailed response to questions.  BP Shipping operated or rented 97 vessels at the end of
2010, completed 1,193 voyages and carried 73 million metric tons
of cargo during the year, the report said. Thirty-one of the
ships were leased under a time-charter arrangement.  BP chartered 427 tankers for single voyages to haul crude
or fuel oil in 2010, second only to the shipping and trading
division of Royal Dutch Shell Plc with 725, according to  data 
compiled by New York-based tanker shipbrokers and energy
consultants Poten & Partners, Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
