The Polish zloty slid for the first
time in four days after a report showed the German economy
almost stalled in the second quarter.  The zloty lost 0.3 percent to 4.1574 per euro as of 9:12
a.m. in Warsaw.  Germany ’s gross domestic product, adjusted for
seasonal effects, rose 0.1 percent from the first quarter, the
statistics office said today. Economists had forecast  Europe ’s
largest economy would expand by 0.5 percent. Germany is Poland’s
biggest trading partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
