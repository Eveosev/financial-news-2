Security forces conducting an
operation to capture “criminals and extremists” responsible
for violence in the northern  Sinai Peninsula  have arrested 12
people, the state-run  Al Ahram  newspaper  said .  One of those captured was killed in a shootout with
“terrorist elements,” the Cairo-based newspaper said. Troops
seized three machine guns, four hand grenades, a large amount of
ammunition and military uniforms, it said.  The mission to “cleanse” the Sinai, known as Operation
Eagle, involves central security, special operations and anti-
terrorism forces backed by four planes, Al Ahram said, citing an
unidentified security official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
