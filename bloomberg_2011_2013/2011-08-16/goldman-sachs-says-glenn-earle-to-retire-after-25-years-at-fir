(Corrects date of memo in second paragraph.)  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said Glenn Earle, chief operating officer of its European,  Middle East  and
African unit, will retire after almost 25 years with the firm.  Earle, 53, will be replaced by Robin Vince, global head of
operations, the bank said in a memorandum to employees last
month. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London confirmed the
contents of the document today.  Earle’s “judgment regarding reputational and suitability
matters was invaluable in meeting the needs of our clients and
protecting the firm’s global franchise,” New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in the memo.  The bank was last year accused by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and a Senate subcommittee of misleading
customers in a 2007 mortgage-linked investment. Goldman Sachs
paid $550 million in July 2010 to settle the SEC’s lawsuit,
without admitting or denying guilt, and said it made a mistake
in the marketing materials.  Earle, who received a master’s in business administration
from  Harvard Business School , joined the firm in 1987 and became
a partner in 1996. Between 1996 and 1999 he helped the firm
develop its operations in central and eastern  Europe , the Middle
East and  Africa . He was co-head of the European advisory group
within the investment banking unit from 1999 to 2004 before
being named chief operating officer for the region in 2006.  In the first half of 2011, Goldman Sachs’s operations in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, known as EMEA, contributed
$4.63 billion of revenue, 24 percent of the total, down from 28
percent in the same period a year earlier, according to the
firm’s quarterly 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The region contributed $1.57 billion toward pretax
profit in the first half, 27 percent of the total.  Vince, who will remain global operations head, will be
based in  London . He became a managing director in 2002 and a
partner in 2006. Financial News reported Earle’s retirement
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
