Kuwait  may post a budget surplus of
as much as 11.4 billion dinars ($41.8 billion) based on
projections that average  oil prices  will be between $104 and
$112 a barrel for the whole of this fiscal year, the  National
Bank of Kuwait (NBK)  said.  The government is projecting a budget deficit of 6 billion
dinars in the current fiscal year which ends on March 31, based
on an oil price of $60 a barrel. Spending is forecast at 19.4
billion dinars, the highest in Kuwait’s history, and revenue at
13.5 billion dinars.  “If, as we expect, spending comes in at 5 to 10 percent
below the government’s forecast, the budget could see a surplus
of between 7.3 billion dinars and 11.4 billion dinars,” the
country’s largest commercial bank forecast in an e-mailed report
today. NBK’s estimates are before the allocation of 10 percent
of revenue in the  Reserve Fund  for Future Generations as
required by law.  If the bank’s estimates are correct, this would be the
state’s 13th successive budget surplus, according to the report.  Crude for September delivery was trading at $86.96 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:01 p.m. in Kuwait.  Kuwait’s budget surplus reached a record of 5.3 billion
dinars in the last fiscal year. Income was 21.5 billion dinars,
more than double projections, while spending was 16.2 billion
dinars, or 7 percent lower than estimates, according to final
data posted on the Finance Ministry  website  on August 11.  Kuwait is the fourth-biggest producer, along with the
 United Arab Emirates  in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, and pumped 2.5 million barrels a day last June
according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
