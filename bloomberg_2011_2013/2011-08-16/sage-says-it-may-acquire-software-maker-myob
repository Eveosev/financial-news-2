Sage Group Plc (SGE)  said it’s considering
a purchase of MYOB Pty Ltd., an Australian provider of
accounting software, in a possible bid to expand its business-
management offerings.  An acquisition isn’t certain, the Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
England-based software publisher said today in a statement.
MYOB, based near Melbourne, is owned by Australian private-
equity firm  Archer Capital .  Providers of business software and information technology
services are extending their global reach through acquisitions
to get ahead in new technologies such as cloud computing. Paris-
based  Cap Gemini SA (CAP)  said in July it completed the purchase of
Prosodie SA, a maker of software for e-commerce and
telecommunications, for an enterprise value of 382 million euros
($550 million).  Reuters reported earlier that an MYOB deal may be worth
about $1.3 billion, without saying how it obtained the
information. Sage may be willing to pay more than potential
private-equity bidders, the  news agency  said.  Sage didn’t disclose the amount of a possible offer for
MYOB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
