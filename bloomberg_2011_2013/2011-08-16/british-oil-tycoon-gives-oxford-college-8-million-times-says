Peter Levine, 55, a British oil
tycoon living in  Switzerland , is giving Trinity College, Oxford,
from which he graduated in the 1970s, a gift of more than 5
million pounds ($8 million), the London-based Times reported.  Some of the money will be used to provide annual grants to
students who don’t qualify for Oxford bursaries, and those who
have lost one or both of their parents will have priority, the
newspaper said.  Levine himself lost his father during his first term at
Trinity and his mother shortly after graduating with a degree in
jurisprudence; mindful of his own experience, he’s created what
are thought to be the first alumni-funded bursaries for bereaved
undergraduates since the Victorian epoch, the Times said.  Kevin Knott, the estates bursar at Trinity, said Levin’s
gift will help to make Oxford “affordable for students from
whatever background and reduce their indebtedness when they
leave,” the newspaper reported.  Levine founded the steel and oil company Imperial Energy
Plc, which operated in Russia and  Kazakhstan ; he sold it to the
state-owned Indian oil company ONGC Videsh Ltd. for $2.4 billion
in 2008, and his personal fortune is estimated at 120 million
pounds ($196 million), the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
