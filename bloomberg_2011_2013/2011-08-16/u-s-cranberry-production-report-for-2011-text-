The following is the text of the
U.S. cranberry production report from the U.S. Agriculture
Department:  2011 Cranberry Production Up 10 Percent  The forecast for the 2011 cranberry crop is 7.50 million
barrels, up 10 percent from 2010. If realized, this will be the
second largest production on record. Production forecasts are up
from last year in  Massachusetts ,  Oregon , Washington, and
 Wisconsin  but down in New Jersey.  In Wisconsin, a cool spring did not damage the crop but
reportedly lengthened the growing season. The crop was reported
to be progressing well. Favorable weather conditions in
Massachusetts during June and the first half of July aided
pollination. Some growers reported higher than normal weed
pressure. Harvested acreage is reportedly down in New Jersey
this season and some growers expressed concerns of potential sun
scalding of fruit due to above normal temperatures. However, the
crop was generally in good condition with no unusual problems
reported. The Oregon crop has rebounded from last yearâ€™s low
production. The growing season was delayed by a cool spring but
recent favorable weather conditions have improved crop
development.  Cranberry Production - States and United States: 2009, 2010, and

----------------------------------------------------------  Statistical Methodology  Survey procedures: Grower surveys are conducted in preparation
for this report. Producers are contacted to obtain expected
production and their assessment of the current crop relative to
a full crop. Telephone follow-up of mail survey non-respondents
is used to ensure adequate coverage.  Estimating procedures: Information obtained from the cranberry
grower survey along with federal administrative data is used to
establish forecasts of total production. These forecasts are
reviewed for errors, reasonableness, and consistency with
historical estimates.  Revision policy: Cranberry production forecasts will not be
revised. End-of-season estimates of production are made
following harvest and are subject to revision the following year
based on a thorough review of all available data.  Reliability: Survey indications are subject to sampling
variability because all operations growing cranberries are not
included in the sample. Survey results are also subject to non-
sampling errors such as omission, duplication, imputation for
missing data, and mistakes in reporting, recording, and
processing the data. These errors cannot be measured directly,
but they are minimized through rigid quality controls in the
data collection process and a careful review of all reported
data for consistency and reasonableness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
