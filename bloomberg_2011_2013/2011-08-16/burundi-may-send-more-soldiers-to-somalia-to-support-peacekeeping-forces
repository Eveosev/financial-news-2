Burundi may send additional
peacekeepers to  Somalia  to bolster an African Union-led mission
that is trying to stabilize the country, Burundian President
Pierre Nkurunziza said.  “Burundi will send more troops to Somalia to reinforce
security if it is deemed necessary,” Nkurunziza told reporters
yesterday in Bujumbura, the capital. The government will also
encourage Somalia to begin preparing its forces to take over
from the African Union mission when its mandate in the country
ends, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
