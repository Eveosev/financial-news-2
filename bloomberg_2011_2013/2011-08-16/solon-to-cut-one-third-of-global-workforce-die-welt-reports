Solon SE (SOO1) , a German maker of solar
modules, plans to cut about a third of its global workforce by
the end of this year, Die Welt newspaper  reported , citing an
internal company document.  Berlin-based Solon plans to cut the jobs of 265 of its 805
workers in Germany, the U.S. and  Italy  in a bid to reduce costs
amid falling sales for its photovoltaic products, Die Welt said
in its Welt Kompakt edition. Solon told the newspaper it plans
to cut employees but hasnâ€™t made a final decision on how many.  To contact the reporter on this story:
