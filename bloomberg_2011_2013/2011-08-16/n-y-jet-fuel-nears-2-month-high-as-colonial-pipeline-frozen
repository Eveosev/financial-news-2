Jet fuel in  New York  strengthened to
the highest level since June as Colonial Pipeline Co. froze
nominations on a line that ships products in the region.  The operator of the largest pipeline linking the East Coast
and  Gulf Coast  froze nominations for cycle 43 on Linden line 6
to  BP Plc (BP)  and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP’s Carteret, New
Jersey, storage tanks.  The premium for jet fuel versus heating oil futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose 1.25 cents to 11 cents
at 1:56 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the
highest level since June 20. Prompt delivery gained 0.37 cent to
$3.0453 a gallon.  Linden line 6 is a part of the Intra Harbor transfer
system, connecting Colonial’s main line from the Gulf Coast to
oil product storage tanks.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in New York
weakened for a third day.  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  finished work at the
Dartmouth refinery in Nova Scotia last week and Korea National
Oil Corp. began starting the Come-by-Chance refinery in
Newfoundland.  RBOB delivered at the trading hub slipped 1 cent to a
premium of 9.5 cents a gallon over Nymex futures. Prompt
delivery fell 2.71 cents to $2.9524 a gallon.  The same fuel in the Gulf Coast gained 2 cents to a premium
of 3.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
