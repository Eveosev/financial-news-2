German 10-year government bond
futures may decline in the near term after the September
contract failed to push toward the all-time high of 134.77, said
JPMorgan Chase & Co, citing trading patterns.  Any pullback is likely to be temporary as charts suggest
the market has room for further gains after a 3.9 percent
advance last month, the bank wrote in an e-mailed note today.
The September contract will find support, or levels where buying
orders may be concentrated, at 132.85 and 131.42, it said.  “The pullback has had a corrective tone, and the monthly
and weekly momentum measures retain a buy signal,” wrote
JPMorgan technical analysts Michael Krauss and Jason Hunter in
 New York . “For now, the bull trend is intact until the price
action confirms otherwise.”  The bund September contract snapped three days of losses to
trade less than 0.1 percent higher at 132.97 at 4:47 p.m. in
 London . This year’s average is 124.28. The contract reached a
record high in August last year.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance levels are ceilings
restricting further price increases, while support levels are
floors limiting declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
