Gold futures rose to a record
settlement as the sagging European economy spurred demand for
the precious metal as an investment haven.  The German economy,  Europe ’s largest, almost stalled in the
second quarter as the region’s sovereign-debt crisis weighed on
confidence. Germany and France are working on “ambitious”
joint proposals to defend the euro, French President  Nicolas
Sarkozy  said today.  “Gold is the quintessential hedge when there are worries
about the economy,” Dave Meger, the director of metal trading
at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “The comments from Sarkozy provided further
support.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $27, or 1.5
percent, to close at $1,785 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. That’s the highest settlement ever. The metal has
jumped 46 percent in the past year, reaching a record $1,817.60
on Aug. 11.  Global equities fell for the first time in four sessions as
 France  and Germany said they will propose a financial
transaction tax and rejected the sale of common European bonds.  “There are still far too many macro uncertainties at the
moment, with softening economic readings,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov ,
an analyst at VTB Capital in London, said in a report.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 51.1 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $39.848 an ounce on the Comex. The price has
more than doubled in the past 12 months.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
September delivery climbed $10.15, or 1.4 percent, to $756.50 an
ounce. Platinum futures for October delivery advanced $20.90, or
1.2 percent, to $1,818.10 an ounce on the Nymex. Earlier, it
touched $1,828, the highest level since June 13.  To contact the reporters for this story:
