Fitch Ratings  affirmed its AAA
credit rating on the U.S. and said the outlook on the long-term
ratings is stable.  Standard & Poor’s  on Aug. 5 cut the U.S. credit rating to
AA+ from AAA, saying lawmakers failed to cut spending enough to
reduce record deficits. S&P dropped the ranking after warning on
July 14 that it would reduce the rating in the absence of a
“credible” plan to lower deficits even if the nation’s debt
limit was lifted.   Fitch said Aug. 2 that the U.S. is under review as the
nation’s debt burden increases at a pace that isn’t consistent
with an AAA sovereign credit rating.  Moody’s Investors Service affirmed the U.S.’s top Aaa
ranking on Aug. 8 in part because the dollar’s status as the
main reserve currency allows it to support higher debt levels
than other countries. Lawmakers’ agreement on Aug. 2 put in
place a plan to enforce $2.4 trillion in spending reductions
over the next 10 years was a “positive step” toward addressing
the nation’s record deficits,  Steven Hess , the senior credit
officer at Moody’s in  New York , said Aug. 8 in a telephone interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
