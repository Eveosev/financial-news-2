OAO Surgutneftegas, the Russian oil
producer that reported a 39 percent jump in profit yesterday,
may have almost as much cash as its market value, showing that
investors are ignoring its ready funds, Troika Dialog said.  The Surgut-based company had an estimated $28.7 billion in
cash and liquid assets at the end of June, Oleg Maximov, Alex Fak and  Valery Nesterov , Moscow-based analysts at the brokerage,
wrote in a research note today. That compares with a market
capitalization of about $29 billion.  Investors are “clearly discounting most or all of this
cash,” the analysts said. Surgutneftegas fell as much as 3.1
percent to 22.907 rubles in Moscow, and traded at 23.295 rubles
as of 12:03 p.m. local time, extending its decline this year to
28 percent.  Surgutneftegas, which explores for oil and gas at fields in
Western Siberia, has been cited as a takeover target for Russian
state energy producers in the past. Deutsche Bank AG said in
December 2006 that the company was “ripe for acquisition” and
that a purchase by OAO Rosneft was possible. Surgutneftegas
dismissed the claims and a takeover never materialized.  Net income increased to 77.8 billion rubles ($2.71 billion)
in the first half from 56 billion rubles a year earlier, the
company said yesterday. Surgutneftegas reports earnings based on
Russian accounting standards.  Production at the company rose to 1.23 million barrels of
oil a day last month, according to the Energy Ministry’s
statistic’s unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
