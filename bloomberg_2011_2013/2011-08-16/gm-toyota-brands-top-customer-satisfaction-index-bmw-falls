General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac brand
and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s namesake division and luxury Lexus line
topped the American Customer Satisfaction Index’s annual ranking
of automakers.  Toyota was the only non-premium brand in the top five,
tying Cadillac and Lexus with 87 on a scale of 100, followed by
 Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Lincoln and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz with 86.
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  was No. 11, receiving an 83,
dropping three points to its lowest mark since an 80 in 1997.  The Toyota score is “a surprise,” Claes Fornell, who
created the index in 1994, said in a phone interview. “Toyota
makes a fair amount of fairly low-priced cars. For them to be
that well-received is impressive, especially when you have a
company like BMW scoring lower.”  The index is based on interviews with about 70,000
customers annually concerning satisfaction with goods and
services. The annual auto rankings, based on data from 5,000
surveys collected during the second quarter, were released
today.  The  auto industry  improved by 1 point to 83, its second-
highest mark. Chrysler Group LLC’s Chrysler brand was the
lowest-rated nameplate in the survey at 76.  To contact the reporter on this story:
