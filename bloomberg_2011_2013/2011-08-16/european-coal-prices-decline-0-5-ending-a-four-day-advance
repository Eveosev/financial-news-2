European coal prices fell, ending a
four-day advance.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year fell 0.5 percent to $127 a metric ton by
12:21 p.m. in  London . Before today, prices climbed 2 percent
since Aug. 9.  European utilities began to stockpile thermal coal last
week for winter, helping to make the Atlantic coal market more
balanced, Judy Zhu, an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc, wrote
in an e-mailed report today. There will be a “decisive”
increase in demand next month, Zhu wrote.  The European coal prices are from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
Spectron Group Ltd., Credit Suisse Group AG, HIS McCloskey,
Bloomberg, Tradition Financial Services and Tullett Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
