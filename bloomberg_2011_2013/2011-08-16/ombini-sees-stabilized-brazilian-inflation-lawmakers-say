Brazilian central bank President
Alexandre Tombini believes the country’s inflation rate is
“stabilized,” according to lawmakers who met with him in
Brasilia today.  Tombini “was very optimistic, he painted a picture of a
very positive outlook for the Brazilian economy,” said Lincoln
Portela, leader of the Party of the Republic in the lower house.
“His view was that inflation is stabilized.”  Inflation accelerated to 6.87 percent in July, its fastest
pace since 2005. Tombini has raised borrowing costs at all five
of the central bank’s policy meetings this year, to 12.50
percent, and has repeatedly stated that he expects inflation to
slow to the mid-point of its target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5
percent in 2012.  Another lawmaker who attended the meeting with Tombini also
said that the central bank president had been optimistic.  “Tombini said the scenario is that inflation is under
control,” said Eduardo Cunha, a lower house representative for
the Democratic Movement Party, or PMDB, in a phone interview.  Portela and Cunha are both members of parties that belong
to President Dilma Rousseff’s ruling coalition in Congress.  A press officer at the central bank declined to comment
when contacted by phone, on the grounds that the discussions
were private.  The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.5916 per dollar at 3:00
p.m. New York time from 1.5889 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
