Jim Thome became the eighth member
of  Major League Baseball ’s 600-home run club when he hit two in
the Minnesota Twins’ 9-6 win over the Detroit Tigers.  Thome, 40, hit a three-run homer to left field on a 2-1
pitch from Daniel Schlereth in the seventh inning for his 600th
career home run to give the Twins a 9-5 lead. His 599th home run
was a two-run shot off Rick Porcello to break a 3-3 tie in the
sixth inning. Thome has 11 home runs this season.  The 6-foot-3, 250-pound Thome acknowledged the standing
ovation from the crowd of 36,211 as he rounded the bases at
Comerica Park in Detroit last night before being greeted by his
teammates at home plate. The Tigers also posted a congratulatory
message on the scoreboard.  “I envisioned doing this in  Minnesota , amongst the home
fans, but to do it anywhere is great,” Thome told reporters.
“To watch them stand up and cheer is very special, something
I’ll never forget.”  The five-time All-Star joins  Barry Bonds , Hank Aaron,  Babe Ruth , Willie Mays, Ken Griffey Jr.,  Sammy Sosa  and Alex Rodriguez as the only major leaguers with 600 or more homers. He
and Rodriguez, of the  New York Yankees , are the only active
players on the list.  Thome reached the mark in his 8,137th at-bat, the second-
fewest after Ruth, who hit 600 home runs in 6,921 at-bats.  The Twins won for just the second time in 10 games to
improve to 53-67, while the American League Central-leading
Tigers dropped to 64-57. Minnesota is 10 1/2 games behind
 Detroit .  Delmon Young, who was traded to the Tigers from the Twins
yesterday, hit a home run in the first inning to give Detroit a
1-0 lead.  Steroids Issue  Thome never has been linked to the surge in steroid use
that propelled home-run production in the 1990s and the early
2000s.  Bonds, the career leader with 762 homers, is awaiting
sentencing for obstructing justice in a federal investigation of
steroid use. Sosa was called before a U.S. congressional
committee hearing on drugs in baseball. Rodriguez acknowledged
using them while with the Texas Rangers.  Thome has played for four teams besides the Twins,
including the first 12 years of his major league career with the
 Cleveland Indians  starting in 1991.  In addition to his power, Thome is a league leader in
personality. Sports Illustrated’s 2007 poll of 464 major
leaguers named him as baseball’s second-friendliest player,
behind Mike Sweeney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
