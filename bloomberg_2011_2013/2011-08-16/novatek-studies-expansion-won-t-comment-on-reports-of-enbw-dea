OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-largest
natural-gas producer, is studying “market opportunities” to
expand, Chief Financial Officer Mark Gyetvay said, declining to
comment on reports of a potential acquisition in  Europe .  Handelsblatt reported last month that German utility EnBW
Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG had offered a stake of as much as
25 percent in gas supplier Verbundnetz Gas AG to Novatek. EnBW,
which holds options on 48 percent of Verbundnetz Gas, is
pursuing cooperation with Novatek that may involve cheaper gas
deliveries from Russia, the German newspaper said.  “It is our policy not to comment on market speculation and
rumors, therefore I will not be answering any specific questions
relating to the recent market news on potentially entering the
European market via an acquisition,” Gyetvay said today on a
conference call with investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
