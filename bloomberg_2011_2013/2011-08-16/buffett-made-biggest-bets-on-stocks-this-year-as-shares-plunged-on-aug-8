Billionaire investor  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  made its biggest bets on the
stock market of this year on Aug. 8 as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index plunged the most since December 2008.  “I like buying on sale,” Buffett, Berkshire’s chief
executive officer and head of investments, said in a television
interview with Charlie Rose to be broadcast today on PBS. “Last
Monday, we spent more money in the stock market buying than any
day this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
