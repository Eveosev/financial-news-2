Arsenal agreed to terms with
Galatasaray over the transfer of Emmanuel Eboue to the Turkish
club, the Premier League team said on its  website .  Eboue, who can play both midfield and in defense, scored 13
goals in 214 appearances for Arsenal since joining in January
2005 from Beveren in  Belgium . The 28-year-old Ivory Coast
international has seen his playing time decrease over the past
few seasons, totaling just 13 Premier League games in 2010-11.  Eboue’s departure comes a day after former Arsenal captain
Cesc Fabregas completed his move to Barcelona. Samir Nasri has
also been linked with a move to  Manchester City  before the
transfer period closes Aug. 31.  Arsenal also said that striker Carlos Vela and defender
Pedro Botelho will move to Spanish clubs this season  on loan .  Vela, 22, will join Real Sociedad. The Mexico international
spent part of last season on loan at West Bromwich Albion.  Botelho, 21, returns to Spain with Rayo Vallecano. He’s
previously had loan spells at Salamanca and Celta Vigo after
signing for Arsenal in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
