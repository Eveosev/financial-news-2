Florida Governor  Rick Scott 
overstepped his authority by suspending state-agency rulemaking
and requiring agencies to seek permission to issue new
regulations from an accountability office he created, the
state’s highest court decided.  The Florida Supreme Court said today that the Republican
governor violated the separation of powers and overstepped his
constitutional authority. The ruling came in a lawsuit brought
by a Florida food stamp recipient who claimed that the state
legislature, not the governor, is responsible for decisions over
agency rulemaking.  The court, ruling 5-2, said that Scott’s executive orders
“infringe upon the very process of rulemaking and encroach upon
the legislature’s delegation of its rulemaking power.” The
majority rejected Scott’s argument that the Florida constitution
gave him the power to suspend rulemaking.  The court said the orders won’t be enforced until the
Legislature turns over rulemaking authority to the governor.
Scott, a former hospital chain executive, was elected in
November.  “Governor Scott has a law degree, he has practiced law and
this ruling just doesn’t make sense,” Lane Wright, Scott’s
spokesman, said in a phone interview. “If you consider the fact
that these people are held directly accountable to him, they
are employed at will, it just doesn’t make sense that he can’t
ask them to be held accountable.”  The case is Whiley v. Scott, SC11-592, Florida Supreme
Court, Tallahassee.  To contact the reporters on this story:
