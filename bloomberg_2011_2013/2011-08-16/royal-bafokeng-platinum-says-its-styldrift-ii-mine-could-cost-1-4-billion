Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd. (RBP) , a
South African producer of the metal, is studying a possible 10
billion-rand ($1.4 billion) expansion at the Styldrift project
in South Africa, seeking to boost output as prices rise.  “There is significant upside potential here,” Chief
Operating Officer Nico Muller told investors in Johannesburg
today. The concept study, to be completed in December, will
assess the “high-level business case” for the plan, he said.  The proposed expansion, known as Styldrift II, follows an
increase in demand for platinum, used in jewelry and to curb
pollution from cars. Prices gained 19 percent in the past 12
months to $1,818.75 an ounce as of 4:24 p.m. in  London  today.
South Africa produces more than three-quarters of global supply.  RBPlat, as the Johannesburg-based company is known, will
probably produce about the same amount of platinum group metals
this year as last, Chief Executive Officer Steve Phiri told
investors. Demand is likely to exceed supply in the next three
years, while a shortage of palladium, typically mined along with
platinum, may rise to 1 million ounces in 2014, he said.  RBPlat is already developing the Styldrift I project
northwest of Johannesburg for about 11.6 billion rand. The
company’s platinum group metal output totaled 288,000 ounces
last year and 142,100 ounces in the first half, it said today.  Profit Slides  Earnings fell to 1.05 rand a share in the first half from
1.32 rand a year earlier as costs rose. Labor, power and water
bills are climbing faster than  South Africa ’s consumer prices,
Muller said. The annual inflation rate was 5 percent in June.  A three-year wage deal has been reached with the  National
Union of Mineworkers , South Africa’s largest union, raising pay
by as much as 10 percent this year, 8 percent next year and 9
percent the year after that, RBPlat said today.  The shares fell 21 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 55.39 rand at
the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, extending their decline to 17
percent in the past six months. Anglo American Platinum Ltd.,
the largest producer of the metal, dropped 22 percent to 551.50
rand in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
