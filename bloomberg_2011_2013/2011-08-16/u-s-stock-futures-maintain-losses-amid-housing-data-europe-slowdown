U.S. stock futures maintained losses
after housing starts fell in July, indicating the real estate
market is failing to contribute to an economic recovery.     S&P 500  futures expiring in September retreated 1.2 percent
to 1,183.3 as of 8:35 a.m. in  New York . The index gained 2.2
percent yesterday, erasing last week’s drop. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures slid 99 points, or 0.9 percent, to
11,304 today.  Housing starts fell 1.5 percent to a 604,000 annual rate,
in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, from June’s 613,000 pace that was less than
previously estimated, Commerce Department figures showed today
in Washington. Building permits, a proxy for future
construction, also dropped.  Another report may show factory production rose as auto
making began to bounce back from the disaster in Japan.  Stock futures fell earlier after European economic growth
slowed more than economists forecast in the second quarter as
 Germany ’s recovery almost ground to a halt amid the worsening
sovereign-debt crisis.  The S&P 500 rallied 7.5 percent in the past three days,
though is still down 12 percent from a three-year high at the
end of April. Stocks fell in the last three weeks after S&P
downgraded the country’s AAA credit rating and investors became
concerned that the economy is slowing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
