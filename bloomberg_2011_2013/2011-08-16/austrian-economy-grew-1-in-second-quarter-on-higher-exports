Austria’s economy grew in the second
quarter after companies exported more products and the Alpine-
country’s population consumed more goods, the Vienna-based Wifo
economic research institute said today.  Second-quarter gross domestic product, the value of all
services and goods, grew 1 percent after advancing 0.8 percent
in the first three months of the year, according to Wifo.
Compared with a year earlier, the economy expanded 3.7 percent.  “The turbulences on the international financial and
capital markets are causing economic insecurity,” Wifo said in
an e-mailed statement. “Against this backdrop the outlook for
companies is worsening.”  Austrian exports increased 1.8 percent in the quarter,
while consumption rose 0.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
