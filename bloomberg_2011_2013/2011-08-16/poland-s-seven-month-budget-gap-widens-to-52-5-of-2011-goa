Poland’s seven-month central
government budget deficit widened to 52.5 percent of the  full-
year target set in the 2011 budget law.  The shortfall totaled 21.1 billion zloty ($7.3 billion),
compared with 20.2 billion zloty, or 50.7 percent of the annual
goal through June, the  Finance Ministry  said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Revenue in the first seven months was 158.3 billion zloty,
or 58 percent of the 2011 target, while spending totaled 179.4
billion zloty, or 57.3 percent of the plan, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
