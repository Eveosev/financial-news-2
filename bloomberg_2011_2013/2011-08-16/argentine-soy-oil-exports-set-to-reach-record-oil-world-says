Soy-oil exports from  Argentina  will
probably reach a record this month after a strike delayed
shipments, Oil World said.  Deliveries may reach 600,000 metric tons, the Hamburg-based
researcher said in a report today. Shipments totaling 90,000
tons will go to India,  China  may buy as much as 40,000 tons and
the European Union may take 50,000 tons, it said. Argentine
shipments from January through July totaled 2.68 million tons,
according to the report.  “Soy-oil exports will be high in August,” Oil World said.
“This is partly due to some overlapping from July shipments
which actually turned out smaller than expected, partly due to
temporary strike actions at the Argentine ports.”  U.S. soy-oil exports from Oct. 1 totaled 1.2 million tons,
up 3 percent from the prior year, Oil World said. In the week
ended Aug. 4, U.S. exporters sold 21.3 million tons of the oil,
up from 2.4 million tons in the year-earlier week, according to
the report. The oil is used in  food production  as well as paint,
plastics and inks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
