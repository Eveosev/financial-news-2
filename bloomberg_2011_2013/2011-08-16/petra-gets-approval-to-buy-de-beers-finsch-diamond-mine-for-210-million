Petra Diamonds Ltd. (PDL)  gained approval
from the South African government to buy the country’s second-
largest diamond mine from  De Beers  for $210 million.  “The acquisition process is now in the very final stages
and we expect it to complete in the near future,” Petra said in
a statement today. Petra, which agreed to buy the Finsch mine in
January, rose as much as 4.5 percent in London trading.  The purchase will help Petra more than double last year’s
diamond production of 1.1 million carats as it seeks to boost
output to benefit from rising prices. Rough, or uncut, prices
have risen 68 percent this year after two consecutive annual
gains of more than 30 percent, PolishedPrices.com data show.  “Today’s announcement removes a significant part of the
uncertainty regarding the timing of the completion of the Finsch
mine acquisition,” said Dmitry Kalachev, an analyst at
Cannacord Genuity. “The market should now focus on the
company’s exceptional growth profile and cost controls.”  Petra advanced 1.75 pence, or 1.3 percent, to 135.75 pence
by 8:56 a.m. in  London  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
