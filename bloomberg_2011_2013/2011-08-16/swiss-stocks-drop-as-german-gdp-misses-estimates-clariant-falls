Swiss stocks rose, extending the
biggest four-day surge since 2008, after a report showed U.S.
industrial production climbed more than forecast, outweighing
slower-than-estimated economic growth in Germany.  Logitech International SA (LOGN) , the world’s biggest maker of
computer mice, rallied 6.1 percent.  Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s
largest foodmaker, climbed 2 percent.  Geberit AG (GEBN) ,  Europe ’s
largest maker of toilet-flushing systems, slumped 4.2 percent as
earnings declined.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  gained 0.9 percent to 5,373.3 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Zurich, having earlier retreated as much as
1.5 percent, bringing its rally over the past four days to 12
percent. The gauge has still tumbled 20 percent from this year’s
high on Feb. 18 amid concern that the global economic recovery
is stalling, while European leaders struggled to contain the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis. The broader Swiss Performance
Index added 0.6 percent today.  “Industrial production shows that U.S. industry is not
slowing down as fast as feared,” said Christian Gattiker,
Zurich-based head of research at Bank Julius Baer & Co. “The
data is slightly less worrying than economists thought. However,
this is only a snapshot, and the emphasis will soon turn to
leading indices in the next couple of weeks.”  U.S. industrial production climbed 0.9 percent last month,
the most this year, as carmakers started to shake off the
effects of the earthquake in  Japan  and higher temperatures
boosted utility use. Economists had projected a 0.5 percent
gain, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  U.S. Debt Rating  Fitch Ratings  affirmed its AAA credit rating for the U.S.
and said the outlook is stable, citing the nation’s central role
in the global financial system and the flexible, diverse
economy. Fitch had put the rating under review after lawmakers
reached a compromise Aug. 2 on a debt-limit agreement that
prevented a U.S. default.  In  Germany , gross domestic product adjusted for seasonal
effects rose 0.1 percent in the second quarter, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. Economists had
forecast growth of 0.5 percent, according to the median of 33
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. From a year earlier, GDP
increased 2.8 percent.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.2
percent in the second quarter, after a 0.8 percent increase in
the first quarter, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said. That’s the worst performance since the euro
region emerged from a recession in late 2009. Economists had
forecast the economy to expand 0.3 percent.  Logitech Gains  Logitech rallied 6.1 percent to 7.24 Swiss francs, the
highest price this month.  Nestle jumped 2 percent to 50.10 francs as a gauge of
European food and beverage companies was the best performer of
the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the world’s biggest maker of cancer
drugs, climbed 2 percent to 131.40 francs and  Novartis AG (NOVN) ,
Europe’s second-biggest drugmaker by sales, rose 1.8 percent to
44.25 francs.  Geberit retreated 4.2 percent to 160.30 francs as the
company said first-half net income fell to 220.3 million francs
($281 million) from 221 million francs a year earlier.  Orascom Development Holding AG (ODHN) , the owner of holiday
resorts on  Egypt ’s Red Sea coast, dropped 10 percent to 21
francs, its biggest decline since April 2010, after the company
said first-half gross profit fell to 16 million francs from 84
million francs a year earlier.  Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN) , the biggest maker of solar
panel manufacturing equipment, dropped 3 percent to 29.15 francs
after Roth & Rau AG posted a loss before interest and taxes of
24.4 million euros ($35 million) in the first half after a
profit of 6.1 million euros in the year-earlier period. Meyer
Burger agreed to acquire Roth & Rau on April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
