ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an
e-mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.106 percent.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from
August 2015 to February 2017. The purchases are part of the
Fed’s policy to continue to reinvest the proceeds of maturing
assets on its balance sheet to prevent a tightening of monetary
policy.  The central bank plans to purchase $2.5 billion to
$3 billion of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
