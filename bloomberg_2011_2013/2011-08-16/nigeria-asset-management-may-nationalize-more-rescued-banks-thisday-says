Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria , a
state-owned company set up to buy debt from Nigeria’s banks,
will nationalize more lenders bailed out by the nation’s central
bank if shareholders don’t reach agreements with prospective
investors,  ThisDay  reported.  Rescued lenders including Intercontinental Bank Plc, Union
Bank Nigeria Plc, Oceanic Bank International Plc, Equitorial
Trust Bank Ltd. and Finbank Plc have signed agreements with
investors. The lenders will seek court orders to push their
deals and get the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval,
the Lagos-based newspaper said, citing Asset Management Chief
Executive Officer Mustafa Chike-Obi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
