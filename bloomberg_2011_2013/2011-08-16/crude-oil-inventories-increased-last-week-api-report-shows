Crude oil inventories rose 1.75
million barrels to 350.4 million last week, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said today. Futures pared declines in
electronic trading after the report was released.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropped 1.39
million barrels to 33.2 million.  Gasoline stockpiles fell 5.37 million barrels to 205.8
million, the report showed.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil fell
500,000 barrels over the period, according to the median of 16
responses in a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline inventories
probably dropped 1.18 million barrels, the survey showed.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for September delivery fell 81 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $87.07 a barrel at 4:32 p.m. in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract, which settled
at $86.65, traded at $86.91 a barrel before report was released
at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
