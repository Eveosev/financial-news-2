More than a hundred workers at OAO
 AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) ,  Russia â€™s largest carmaker, have sought medical
attention with symptoms that appear to be caused by food
poisoning,  Interfax  reported today, citing the local consumer
watchdog.  The 114 employees at the Togliatti-based automaker are
being tested to determine the source of the illness, an
unidentified official from the local branch of the Federal
Consumer Protection Service told the news agency.  Forty of those who sought attention have been hospitalized,
Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
