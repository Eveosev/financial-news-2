Renaissance Services SAOG (RNSS)  said today
that only one of the management changes at its unit Topaz Group,
which in March delayed a share sale in  London , was linked to a
financial fraud.  The official suspended was a junior level finance manager
in an overseas subsidiary of Topaz, and the departure of senior
Topaz managers was due to business considerations and cost
saving, the company said in an e-mailed statement. The amount
that appears to be linked to the fraud investigation is a
portion of a total of $2.9 million over 6-1/2 years, Renaissance
said.  The company had said in a statement yesterday that top
management left after it “uncovered some serious issues” at
the unit. Topaz Chief Executive Officer Fazel Fazelbhoy stepped
down in May after Renaissance, its finance director and the
chief operating officer of Topaz Engineering also resigned, and
the entire corporate human resources department was removed,
Renaissance said in a  statement  to the Muscat, Oman stock market
yesterday.  The company’s shares slumped 10 percent today to close at
0.559 rial in Muscat, having also lost 10 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
