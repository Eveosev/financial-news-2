Russian producer prices rose less
than expected last month, providing a further signal inflation
is easing after consumer-price growth slowed in June and July.  Prices of goods leaving factories and mines grew 16.1
percent from a year earlier after an 18.6 percent advance in
June, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said in an e-
mailed statement today. The median forecast of nine economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 18.7 percent.  Factory-gate prices declined 1 percent in July from the
previous month after a 2.2 percent drop in June, the service
said. Economists expected an increase of 0.5 percent, according
to the median of 12 estimates in a separate Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
