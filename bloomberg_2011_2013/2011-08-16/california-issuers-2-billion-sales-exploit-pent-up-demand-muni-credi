California issuers plan to sell $1.8
billion of municipal bonds this week, as investor demand drives
yields on the state’s 10-year debt to the lowest in 11 months.  California entities are generating about a third of this
week’s total issuance even as borrowing from within the state
has fallen compared with previous years. They will have sold $17
billion of long-term tax-exempt and taxable debt from January
through Aug. 19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
below the $33 billion average for the fixed-rate securities for
the same period since 2003.  “There’s been a real lack of California paper out here,”
Bud Byrnes, chief executive officer of Encino, California-based
RH Investment Corp., said in a telephone interview. “The market
has rallied very strongly. There’s been a real flight to
quality, or a flight to all fixed income, and the market will
welcome all these new deals.”  Overall municipal issuance totals $6 billion this week
following $3.95 billion last week. Sales from January through
last week was $133 billion, compared with $238.5 billion during
the same period in 2010.  Yields on tax-exempt debt fell this month, touching lows
for the year as investors rushed to Treasury and municipal debt.
Yields on top-rated 10-year tax-exempt bonds hovered at 2.29
percent yesterday. Yields on top-rated 30-year tax-exempt bonds
rose 1 basis point yesterday to 3.86 percent after reaching a
2011 low of 3.85 percent Aug. 12. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  ‘Real Dearth’  There will be enough appetite for the surge of California
issuance this week, Alan Schankel head of fixed-income research
for Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia said in a telephone
interview.  “The market can handle it mostly because there’s been a
real dearth of California paper,” Schankel said. “There just
hasn’t been much to buy out there and California is a big state
with relatively high taxes so there’s lot of demand from
California-specific funds and individual investors of California
paper.”  Yields on top-rated 10-year California debt fell yesterday
to 3.67 percent, the lowest since Sept. 1. Yields on top-rated
30-year California debt were 4.95 percent yesterday, after
reaching that 2011 low on Aug. 11.  Utilities Lead Sales  The  California Department of Water Resources , which
provides electricity to three-quarters of the state, leads the
group of 13 Golden State sales, with a $1 billion tax-exempt
power-supply revenue bond deal. The offering, set to begin
pricing today, includes serial maturities from 2012 through
2021, according to sale documents.  Southern California  Public Power Authority is set to issue
$159.4 million of tax-exempt revenue bonds as soon as Aug. 18.
The deal will finance the prepayment of electricity from a wind-
powered electric generating facility in  Utah , according to sale
documents. The transaction includes serial maturities from 2012
through 2031.  Cucamonga Valley Water District, which provides water
services to 186,000 customers in Southern California, will issue
as soon as today $110.9 million of tax-exempt water-revenue
bonds to convert short-term debt into long-term securities,
according to sale documents. Assured Guaranty Ltd. will provide
credit enhancement on the sale. The deal’s structure includes
serial maturities from 2012 through 2031 and a $28 million
portion due in 2035.  The  University of California Regents,  which borrows for the
 University of California  system’s 10 campuses, is selling at
least $400 million of taxable and tax-exempt revenue bonds as
soon as Aug. 18. Proceeds will help finance capital projects and
refund debt, according to sale documents.  Following is a description of a pending sale of municipal
debt:  Indiana Finance Authority, which issues debt to fund
business development, is selling $1.06 billion of tax-exempt
sewer and water revenue bonds. Proceeds will enable CWA
Authority Inc., a nonprofit public benefit corporation created
last year, to buy Indianapolis’s sewer system from the city. The
transaction will also allow the city to sell its water system to
Citizens Energy Group, a department within the city. The bonds
are rated AA,  Standard & Poor’s  third-highest grade. Morgan
Stanley will lead a syndicate of banks. (Added Aug. 16)  To contact the reporter on this story:
