Community banks in the U.S. have
made progress cleaning up their balance sheets even as their
finances remain stressed from loans made during the housing boom
last decade, according to an associate director of the  Federal
Reserve ’s division of banking supervision and regulation.  “In recent quarters, earnings for community banks have
improved notably, and asset quality has largely stabilized and
begun to improve,” Kevin Bertsch, a Fed associate director who
testified before a U.S. House Financial Services subcommittee in
Newnan,  Georgia , said today.  Still, “earnings remain quite weak by historical
standards, and high levels of problem loans and charge-offs
continue to strain bank resources,” he said. The banks are
under stress from a high concentration of construction and
commercial real estate loans that began in the early part of the
last decade.  “Loan balances at community banks have declined for 11
consecutive quarters,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
