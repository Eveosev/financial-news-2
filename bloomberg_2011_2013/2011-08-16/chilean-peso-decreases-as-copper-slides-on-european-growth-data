Chile ’s peso weakened as copper fell
on concern about the outlook for demand after the euro-area
economy expanded at the slowest pace in two years.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 472.84 pesos per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:35 a.m. New York time, from 472.04 yesterday. The currency
has depreciated against the dollar for two consecutive days.  “Copper is falling and so are European stocks, which is
increasing investors’ aversion to risk,” Cristian Donoso, a
trader at Banchile Corredora de Bolsa, said in a telephone
interview from Santiago. “That’s bad for the peso and has been
causing it to depreciate today.”  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports fell 7
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.96 per pound on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , weakening the country’s terms of trade.
European stocks fell, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index snapping
its biggest three-day rally since May 2010, as the economies of
the euro area and  Germany  grew at a slower-than-estimated pace.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, was little changed at 5.05
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
