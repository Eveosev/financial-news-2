India ’s 10-year bonds gained for the
first time in three days after a government report showed
inflation slowed last month.  Yields dropped from a one-week high after Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee said today adequate monsoon rains may
help moderate price gains. The wholesale-price index rose 9.22
percent from a year earlier after a 9.44 percent jump in June,
the commerce ministry said in New Delhi. The  Reserve Bank  of
India raised  interest rates  five times this year to cap prices.
The central bank will review its policy next on Sept. 16.  “Investors have probably added to their holdings after the
report of a drop in inflation,” said R.S. Chauhan, chief dealer
of fixed income and currencies in  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur
in Mumbai. “The rains have also been positive.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.29 percent as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose 16 basis points to 7.84 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
