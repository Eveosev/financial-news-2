Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB signed
an agreement to merge its pension fund with  Afore XXI , the fund
50 percent owned by the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social.  Under the agreement, IMSS, as the government health and
social services provider for private sector workers is known,
will buy the 49-percent stake in Banorte’s pension fund
currently held by  Italy ’s  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G)  and another
1 percent from Banorte to hold a 50 percent stake, according to
a statement to Mexico’s stock exchange.  Banorte has also presented an offer to buy  Prudential
Financial Inc. (PRU) ’s 50 percent stake in Afore XXI, the bank said.  The agreement is subject to approval from government
regulators and the stakeholders, Banorte said. It did not
disclose financial terms.  Afore XXI had a total of 102 billion pesos under management
and Banorte’s pension managed 93.8 billion pesos as of July 29,
according to the website of Mexican pension regulator  Consar .
Their combined assets under management form the nation’s fourth-
largest pension fund.  To contact the reporters on this story:
