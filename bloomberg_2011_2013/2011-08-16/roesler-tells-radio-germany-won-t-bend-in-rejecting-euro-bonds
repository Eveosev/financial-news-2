German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said his government won’t bend in its opposition to
common euro bonds to help solve  Europe ’s debt crisis, the Free
Democrat said in a Deutschlandfunk Radio  interview .  Germany  backs creating a “stability union” that focuses
on the sustainability of euro-region finances, Roesler said.
That includes all states adopting “debt brakes” in their
constitutions, automatic sanctions for infringements and
boosting the economic competitiveness of the states, he said.  “You’ll see that we unequivocally back this stability
union. That’s the position of the German government and -- as
made clear in statements -- we view euro bonds as the wrong
way,” Roesler said.  To contact the reporters on this story: Brian Parkin in Berlin
