Parkson Holdings Bhd. (PKS) , a Kuala
Lumpur-based department store operator, said it plans to list
its retail operations in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam on the
Singapore stock exchange.  The company expects the sale to be completed by the year-
end, Parkson said in a statement to Bursa Malaysia today. CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
were hired to help manage the sale, according to the statement.  The sale of the business, called Parkson Retail  Asia  Pte.,
may raise S$300 million ($250 million) to S$500 million, said a
person with knowledge of the matter today, before Parkson’s
announcement. The company didn’t say in its statement how much
funds the initial public offering may raise.  Parkson operates 36 department stores in  Malaysia  and seven
in Vietnam, according to its website. The company incorporated
Parkson Retail Asia in Singapore in March. In June, it completed
the purchase of Indonesia’s PT Tozy Sentosa, which owns the
country’s Centro department stores, for $12.8 million.  Malaysian newspaper the Sun Daily reported earlier today
that Parkson Retail Asia will be listed in Singapore soon,
citing sources that it didn’t identify.  Parkson rose 2.6 percent to close at 5.59 ringgit in  Kuala
Lumpur , compared with a 0.1 percent decline in the benchmark
FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
