The fund managing a part of Saudi
Arabia’s foreign exchange reserves may provide loans for
investment in Hungary’s water, environmental and health
industries,  Vilaggazdasag  reported today.  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s planned trip to
Saudi Arabia in late September will help secure loans, the
newspaper said, citing Ferenc Miklossy, the head of the Arab
section of the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  The Saudi loans would be offered at more favorable rates
than those from the  World Bank  or the  International Monetary
Fund , the newspaper said.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
