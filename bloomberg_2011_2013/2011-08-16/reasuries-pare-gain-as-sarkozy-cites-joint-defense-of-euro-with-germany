Treasuries pared their gains as
France’s President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said Germany and France are
working on “ambitious” joint proposals to defend the euro.  “The headlines are weighing on the Treasury market and
supporting equities on the notion that it’s a step closer to
unified fiscal policy, which is the type  of next step out of
Europe that the market wants to see,” said  Ian Lyngen , a
government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut. “It increases the possibility there will be some
type of unified issuance for Europe.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield dropped three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.28 percent at 12:21 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
2.125 percent note maturing in August 2021 gained 9/32, or $2.81
per $1,000 face amount, to 98 21/32. The yield earlier fell five
basis points to 2.26 percent.  Germany and  France  share an “absolute determination” to
defend the euro, Sarkozy told reporters in Paris today after
talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel.  The two nations will propose a financial transaction tax in
September, Sarkozy said. The countries also proposed European
Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  to head a “euro council,”
Sarkozy told reporters in Paris today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
