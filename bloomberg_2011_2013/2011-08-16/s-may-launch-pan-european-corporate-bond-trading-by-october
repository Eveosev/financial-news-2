MTS SpA, the electronic fixed-income
dealing unit of  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) , may offer
trading in corporate bonds in October, according to Chief
Executive Officer Jack Jeffery.  “We will be testing at the end of September and ready to
go in October,” Jeffery told reporters in  London  today, adding
that the timing of the product’s introduction depends on market
conditions. “I’m not sure that we would want to be launching
our product in the current environment. It’s not an environment
that lends itself to building liquidity.”  MTS, which handles average daily volumes of more than 85
billion euros ($122 billion), according to company literature,
announced the plan to open a pan-European electronic market for
corporate debt last November. The platform, known as MTS Credit,
aims to enable trading of more than 2,400 European corporate
bonds, according to the MTS  website .  “There is a significant push to move the markets to
electronic platforms both for efficiency purposes and for
transparency purposes,” Jeffery said.  The company, which trades the sovereign debt of 17
countries and started offering trading in U.K. government bonds
in July, also intends to introduce a platform to trade credit
swaps, Jeffery said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
