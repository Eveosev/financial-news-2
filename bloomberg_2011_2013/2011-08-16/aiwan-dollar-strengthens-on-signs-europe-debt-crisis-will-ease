Taiwan ’s dollar rose to its highest
level in almost two weeks before closing little changed as
optimism Europe’s debt crisis will be contained spurred demand
for emerging-market assets.  Asian currencies advanced today on speculation a meeting
between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  will result in action to stop the crisis spreading.  The lack of negative news from the euro zone “is providing
an environment that allows Asia to revert to its fundamental
appreciatory stance versus the greenback,” said  Sacha Tihanyi ,
a Hong Kong-based senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital,
the investment banking unit of Bank of Nova Scotia.  Taiwan’s dollar closed at NT$28.948 against its U.S.
counterpart, from NT$28.952 yesterday, according to Taipei Forex
Inc. It touched NT$ 28.860 earlier, the strongest level since
Aug. 4.  Government bonds  dropped. The yield on the 2 percent notes
due July 2016 increased one basis point to 1.08 percent, prices
from Gretai Securities Market show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.384 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
