Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) ,  Japan ’s largest
trading company, started the country’s first real estate fund
that invests in datacenters, seeking to benefit from a 1.36
trillion yen ($17 billion) market amid rising demand after the
March earthquake.  Diamond Realty Management Inc. , a unit of Mitsubishi, began
the 25.8 billion yen fund this month, with investment from its
parent, domestic institutional investors and pension funds, the
company said in a statement released yesterday on its website.  The rolling blackouts introduced in  Tokyo  after the March
11 magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami damaged a nuclear plant
highlighted the need for quake-resistant datacenters that are
equipped with sufficient electric power during emergencies.  The market for datacenters is likely to expand 8 percent
this fiscal year and may reach 1.9 trillion yen by March 2016,
according to a report by Tokyo-based  MIC Research Institute Ltd.   The fund owns three datacenters occupied by  Softbank Corp. (9984) ,
the exclusive provider of Apple Inc.’s iPhone in Japan, Masafumi
Manno, chief operating officer of Diamond Realty, said today in
a telephone interview. The fund offers at least 8 percent
average annual return, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
