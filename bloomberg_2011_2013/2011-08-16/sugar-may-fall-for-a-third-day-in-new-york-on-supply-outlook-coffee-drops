Sugar prices gained the most in
three weeks on signs that demand may increase in  China , the
world’s second-biggest consumer. Coffee climbed to a one-month
high, and cocoa advanced.  Zhang Sang, an analyst at Huatai Great Wall Futures Co.,
told Xinhua News Agency that China may have a shortfall of 2
million metric tons of sugar this year. The nation’s economic
planning agency has auctioned reserve supplies to curb rising
prices, Xinhua reported. Futures in New York have jumped 48
percent in the past year.  “If the Chinese are coming up that short, then demand is
going to be a little better,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president
at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  Raw sugar for October delivery gained 0.56 cent, or 2
percent, to settle at 28.04 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York , the biggest advance since July 22.  India  is the leading sugar consumer.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery rose 5.6
cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.55 a pound on ICE. Earlier, the
price reached $2.555, the highest for a most-active contract
since July 15.  Cocoa futures for December delivery climbed $58, or 2
percent, to $2,989 a ton in New York, the fourth straight
advance and the biggest since July 13. The commodity has gained
3.5 percent in the past year.  On NYSE Liffe in  London , sugar, coffee and cocoa advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
