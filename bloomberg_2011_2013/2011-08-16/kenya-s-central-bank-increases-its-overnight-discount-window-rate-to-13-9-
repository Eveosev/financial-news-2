Kenya ’s central bank raised its
overnight lending rate to 13.87 percent today from 11.34 percent
yesterday, when it began tightening restrictions on borrowing.  The bank announced on Aug. 12 it would begin applying a 3
percentage-point “penalty” on the benchmark interest rate or
interbank rate, whichever is higher, to loans by banks from the
overnight window. It previously applied the benchmark lending
rate, currently at 6.25 percent and reviewed bi-monthly.  The measures were taken to further tighten monetary policy,
the bank said, after inflation accelerated for a ninth straight
month in July and the shilling weakened to its weakest level in
17 years earlier this month. Today’s increase was posted on the
Nairobi-based regulator’s  website .  The shilling,  Africa ’s second-worst performing currency
this year, weakened 0.4 percent against the dollar to 93.20 by
12:42 p.m. in Nairobi today.  The monthly average  interbank rate  last exceeded 13.87 in
November 1999, when it rose to 16.62 percent, according to data
on the central bank’s website. It didn’t provide daily data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
