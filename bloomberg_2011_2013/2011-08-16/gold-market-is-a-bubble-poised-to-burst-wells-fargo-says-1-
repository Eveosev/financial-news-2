Speculative demand from investors
has pushed the gold market into a “bubble that is poised to
burst” after prices surged to a record this year,  Wells Fargo &
Co . said.  “We have seen the economic damage” of past bubbles and
“feel compelled to ring the warning bells,” Wells Fargo
analysts led by Dean Junkans said in a report dated yesterday
and e-mailed today.  Gold futures have advanced 26 percent this year, following
10 straight annual gains. The price reached a record $1,817.60
an ounce on Aug. 11 on demand for an investment haven as
European and U.S. sovereign-debt woes escalated.  “There could be substantial risk to gold once the fear
that the world is coming to an end subsides,” Junkans said in a
telephone interview from Minneapolis. “We are worried about the
downward risk.”  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold rose to
a record 2,217 tons on Aug. 8, Bloomberg data show. CME Group
Inc. said volume in Comex gold futures and options rose on Aug.
9 to a record 504,368 contracts. That topped the previous all-
time high of 469,689 contracts on July 28, 2010.  Gold futures for December delivery rose $27, or 1.5
percent, to close at $1,785, the highest settlement ever, on the
Comex in New York. Last week, the metal jumped 5.5 percent, the
most since February 2009 and the sixth straight gain.  Soros, Paulson  George Soros  and  Eric Mindich  cut their holdings in the
SPDR Gold Trust, an exchange-traded fund, in the second quarter
as prices rallied, while billionaire  John Paulson  maintained the
largest stake, a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission showed yesterday.  Thailand,  South Korea  and Kazakhstan added gold valued at
about $2.56 billion to their reserves in July, joining Mexico
and  Russia  in increasing holdings this year as central bankers
hedge against depreciating foreign-currency reserves.  About 60 percent of clients surveyed by UBS AG expect gold
to be trading above $1,800 by the end of this year. The survey
was conducted in the first two weeks of August, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
