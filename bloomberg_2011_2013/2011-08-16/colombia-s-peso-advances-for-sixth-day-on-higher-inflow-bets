Colombia ’s peso rose for a sixth
day, its longest winning streak in a year, on speculation
increasing interest rates in the South American country will
lead to higher dollar inflows.  The peso climbed 0.3 percent to 1,775.90 per dollar at
10:40 a.m. New York time, from 1,782 yesterday. It last advanced
for six straight days in August 2010. Colombian markets were
closed yesterday for a national holiday.  “The Colombian economy remains strong and higher rates
also help attract inflows,” said Daniel Escobar, an analyst at
brokerage Global Securities in Bogota.  Colombia’s central bank will raise its overnight lending
rate by a quarter percentage point to 4.75 percent when policy
makers next meet Aug. 19, according to nine of 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The other nine analysts expect a
pause at 4.5 percent.  Escobar predicts policy makers will lift the lending rate
to 5 percent by year-end, widening the  interest-rate 
differential with the U.S. The  Federal Reserve  pledged last week
to keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low at least
through the middle of 2013 in a bid to spur the flagging
economic recovery.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.45
percent, according to data compiled by the nation’s stock
exchange. The bond’s price rose 0.171 centavo to 120.695
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
