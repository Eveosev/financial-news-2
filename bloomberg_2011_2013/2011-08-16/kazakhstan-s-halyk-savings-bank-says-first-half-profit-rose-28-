Halyk Savings Bank, the lender
controlled by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s daughter
and son-in-law, said first-half profit rose 28 percent as
customer transactions grew and loan quality improved.  Net income climbed to 21.1 billion tenge ($143.8 million)
from 16.6 billion tenge a year earlier, the Almaty-based bank
said in a regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
