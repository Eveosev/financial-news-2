Sweden’s Debt Enforcement Agency
will start a collection process against Saab Automobile tomorrow
unless it pays two of its suppliers a total of about $620,000
today, agency official Hans Ryberg said today by telephone.  The process could take months and includes investigating
Saab’s bank accounts and other assets, Ryberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
