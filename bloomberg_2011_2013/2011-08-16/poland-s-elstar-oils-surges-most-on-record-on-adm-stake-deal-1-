Elstar Oils SA (ELS)  gained the most on
record after  Archer Daniels  Midland Co. agreed to buy a majority
stake in the Polish producer of edible oils and biofuels.  Elstar surged as much as 53 percent to 5.25 zloty, the
largest advance since it started trading in Warsaw in 2004, and
was 50 percent higher at 5.17 zloty at 10:26 a.m. in Warsaw.
That valued the company based in Elblag, northern Poland, at 249
million zloty ($86 million).  Archer Daniels, the world’s largest grain processor, plans
to buy 100 percent of Elstar at 5.5 zloty a share in a public
bid after signing a deal with Stanislaw Rosnowski to buy his
50.9 percent stake,  Elstar  said in a regulatory statement on
Aug. 13.  The purchase is subject to approval by antitrust
authorities in Austria,  Germany , Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
