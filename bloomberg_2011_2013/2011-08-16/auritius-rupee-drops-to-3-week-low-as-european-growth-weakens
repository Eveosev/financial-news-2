Mauritius’s rupee declined to a
three-week low against the euro, the currency of its main
trading partner, as European growth slowed more than forecast
amid a debt crisis, curbing demand for riskier assets.  The currency weakened as much as 2.3 percent to 40.8765 per
euro, the weakest since July 22, and traded 1.4 percent lower at
40.5162 by 1:52 p.m. in  Port Louis , the capital. Against the
dollar, the rupee depreciated for a second day, retreating 0.5
percent to 28.15.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.2
percent from the first quarter, when it increased 0.8 percent,
the European Union statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Economists had forecast the economy to expand 0.3 percent.
German bunds rose and Italian and Spanish notes fell after the
data, boosting demand for the safest assets. German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  will meet French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  to
discuss the euro region’s debt crisis today.  “This should send a clear signal to markets that the EU’s
debt problems will continue to plague markets in the foreseeable
future,” analysts at Port Louis-based Mauritius Commercial
Bank, the country’s largest lender by market value, wrote in a
research note to clients today. “We therefore still believe
that the pessimistic feeling will continue to prevail.”  Europe , led by  France , is its main trading partner,
accounting for almost two third of visitors to the Indian Ocean
island nation that relies on tourism and textiles for most of
its foreign-currency earnings.  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.2485 to 27.7137
rupees, while the selling price was 28.7137 per dollar, versus
28.7841 on Aug. 15, according to indicative exchange rates
published today on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website .  Mauritian stocks advanced for a third day, adding 0.1
percent to 1,955.83 by the 1:30 p.m. close. Omnicane Ltd., a
sugar producer with interests in energy, climbed 1.4 percent to
72.5 rupees, the highest in a month, after saying its loss
narrowed in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
