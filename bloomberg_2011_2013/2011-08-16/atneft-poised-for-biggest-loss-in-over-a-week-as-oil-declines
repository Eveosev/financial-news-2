OAO  Tatneft (TATN) , the oil producer
located in Russia’s Tatarstan region, fell by its most in almost
a week as crude declined.  The shares sank 3.6 percent to 158.47 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest fall since Aug. 10.  Crude for September delivery declined as much as $2.26 to
$85.62 a barrel in  New York  after Germany’s economy all but
stagnated in the second quarter, heightening concern that fuel
consumption will diminish.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
