Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency in the last month, extended a decline
and headed for the weakest close in 18 years against the dollar
as demand for the U.S. currency outweighed its inflows.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer
weakened for a second day, losing 0.5 percent to 2,805 per
dollar by 3:11 p.m. in the capital, Kampala, according to
Bloomberg data. This is the weakest level since June 22, 1993.  The “heavy outstanding demand for the dollar” exceeded
the amount coming into the East African nation, Benon Okwenje, a
currency trader at  Stanbic Bank Uganda Ltd. (SBU) , said by phone from
Kampala. Companies are seeking to buy dollars to pay for raw-
material imports, he said.  The currency of East  Africa ’s third-biggest economy
depreciated 9 percent in the last month, and has weakened 18
percent since the beginning of the year, making it the world’s
worst-performing currency over the two periods, according data
compiled by Bloomberg.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 18.7 percent in July from 15.7 percent in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
