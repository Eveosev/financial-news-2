Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760) , the
country’s biggest electricity producer, posted a quarterly loss
that exceeded analysts’ estimates after tariff curbs prevented
the utility from passing on higher fuel costs to customers.  The net loss widened to 1.09 trillion won ($1 billion) in
the three months ended June 30 from 835.6 billion won a year
earlier, the Seoul-based company, known as Kepco, said in a
regulatory filing today. The mean estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was a loss of 511 billion won for the
company and its units.  The supplier of almost all of  South Korea ’s electricity
posted a loss for the second consecutive quarter as the
government allowed Kepco to increase power prices by an average
4.9 percent for the first time in a year, starting Aug. 1.
 Korea ’s import price of crude rose 49 percent per barrel in
July, according to government data.  “The loss was a bit larger than expected as the
government’s power policy affects its business,” said Joshua
Yang, an analyst at Daishin Securities Co., who has a “buy”
recommendation on the stock. “Its operating profit is likely to
swing to positive in the third quarter thanks to the tariff
rise.”  The stock climbed 3.6 percent to 21,550 won in Seoul
trading, paring a gain of as much as 4.6 percent before the
earnings were announced. Korea Electric has slumped 30 percent
in the past year, compared with a 7.8 percent gain in the
benchmark Kospi index.  Power Consumption  Kepco revised the country’s power consumption growth
projection to 5.2 percent for this year from 5.5 percent
estimated in the first quarter, General Manager Kim Jung In said
during an earnings conference call. The forecast is based on a
4.5 percent increase in gross domestic product, Kim said,
without elaborating.  Operating loss, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, widened to 803.6 billion won in the
quarter, from a revised 443.8 billion won loss a year earlier.
Sales rose 11 percent to 9.12 trillion won.  Fuel costs rose 18.5 percent and the purchasing price of
power increased 45 percent in the first half from a year
earlier, the utility said in a statement.  The purchasing price of thermal coal was $115 a metric ton
in the first half, Kim said on the call, without giving a
comparative figure. The cost of liquefied natural gas may
average 841,170 won a ton this year, according to Kim.  Kepco had $3.64 billion of foreign-currency debt as of June
30, of which 62 percent was hedged, Kim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
