Mozambique plans to relocate about
1,200 families from the Limpopo Transfrontier Park that borders
 South Africa  and  Zimbabwe , said Henrique Banze, a cabinet
spokesman.  The people will be moved from the wildlife park by 2014 to
help protect them from animals, Banze told reporters today in
Maputo, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
