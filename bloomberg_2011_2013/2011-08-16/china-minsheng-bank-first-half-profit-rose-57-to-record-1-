China  Minsheng Banking Corp., the
nationâ€™s first non-state lender, said first-half profit jumped
57 percent to a record as income from loans and fees rose.  Net income rose to 13.9 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) from
8.87 billion yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-based lender said
in a Shanghai stock exchange filing today that is prepared
according to China accounting standard. Profit beat the 12.2
billion yuan median estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Net interest income climbed 40 percent from a year earlier
to 29.5 billion yuan, the bank said. Net non-interest income
increased 89 percent to 9.31 billion yuan. Net interest margin,
a measure of lending profitability, widened to 3 percent from
2.92 percent a year ago.  Shares of Minsheng Bank have declined 15 percent in  Hong
Kong  in the past year, underperforming the 4 percent decrease in
the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)  The stock rose 1 percent to close
at HK$6.29 before the earnings announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
