Kenya ’s benchmark coffee price
climbed 2.5 percent at an auction today as bean supplies
declined, according to the Nairobi Coffee Exchange.  The benchmark AA grade sold for an average of $490.56 per
50-kilogram (110-pounds) bag, up from $478.75 a week earlier, as
supplies dropped 17 percent to 673 bags, the exchange said in an
e-mailed report today. The average price for all the coffee sold
fell 4.2 percent to $321.57 a bag, it said.  “The quality of the coffee was slightly lower than what
was offered in the last two weeks,” David Muriithi, the
exchange’s acting chief executive officer, said by phone from
the capital, Nairobi.  Total coffee supplies at the auction fell 6.6 percent to
17,949 bags, according to the statement.  Kenya harvests the bulk of its crop from October through
December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to June.
