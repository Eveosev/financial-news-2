A special Berlin police unit has
started investigating a political motive behind the torching of
11 cars, mainly top-end BMWs, Mercedes and Audis, in the cityâ€™s
Westend and Charlottenburg districts last night.  The arson attacks, which damaged another six cars and one
scooter, began shortly after midnight today and ended about an
hour later, the police said in a  statement . No one was injured.  Because the attacks seem politically motivated, a special
police unit dealing with extremism has started investigating,
police spokesman Martin Otter said in a phone interview today.  There have been six vehicle arson attacks in Berlin since
Aug. 9, with a total of 36 cars destroyed or damaged, according
to police press releases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
