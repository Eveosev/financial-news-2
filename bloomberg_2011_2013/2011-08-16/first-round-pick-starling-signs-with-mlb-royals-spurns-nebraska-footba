Bubba Starling agreed on a contract
with the  Kansas City Royals , choosing to play professional
baseball rather than football at the University of  Nebraska .  Starling, 18, was the fifth pick in this year’s draft and
ranked as the nation’s top high school prospect by  Baseball
America . The center fielder agreed on the deal minutes before
last night’s deadline to sign picks from June’s Major League
Baseball draft and will get a $7.5 million signing bonus spread
over three years,  MLB.com reported .  Starling, who’s from Gardner,  Kansas , was offered a
scholarship from Nebraska to play baseball and quarterback for
the football team. While he worked out with Nebraska’s football
players last month, he didn’t practice after the Cornhuskers
opened preseason camp on Aug. 6.  “This guy is without a doubt one of the best athletes to
play the game of baseball in many years,” Royals General
Manager Dayton Moore said on MLB.com. “We look forward to
moving on in Bubba’s development through our system.”  As a senior at Gardner Edgerton High School, Starling
rushed for 2,417 yards, averaging more than 14 yards a carry,
and scored 31 touchdowns. He batted .481 for the baseball team
while hitting a home run every six at-bats, according to  ESPN .  To contact the reporter on this story:
