Britain’s banks will be forced to
continue to cut costs as they struggle to grow revenue amid
tougher regulation, according to a report by KPMG LLP.  Higher regulatory expenses and a “struggle to grow top
line revenues” mean banks are likely to continue their plans to
reduce costs, the report said. “The next six months will remain
challenging,”  KPMG  said.  The biggest global banks are cutting jobs at the fastest
rate since 2008 as a weak U.S. economy squeezes revenue,
regulators push firms to hold more capital and companies
restructure businesses to improve profitability. Combined pretax
profit for the first half of 2011 at Britain’s five biggest
banks fell by almost half to 7.9 billion pounds ($13 billion)
from a year-earlier as the lenders compensated customers mis-
sold  mortgage insurance  and posted losses on sovereign debt
holdings, KPMG said.  “Concerns about future revenue growth, global regulation
and the final report from the Independent Commission on Banking
are burdening the sector,” said David Sayer, global head of
retail banking at KPMG. “Banks are looking closely at their
business models to determine whether they are sustainable.”  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s plan to shed 30,000 roles, unveiled by
the London-based firm on Aug. 1, was the single biggest job-
cutting announcement since Bank of America said in December 2008
that it would eliminate as many as 35,000 positions, according
to company statements and data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
