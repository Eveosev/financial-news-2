Asian currencies strengthened, led
by  South Korea ’s won, as a rally in global stocks fanned demand
for higher-yielding assets.  All of Asia’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen
advanced against the dollar as the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
shares headed for its biggest two-day gain since June. The yuan
climbed to a 17-year high after the People’s Bank of China
raised its  reference rate  and a China Securities Journal front-
page editorial said conditions are ripe for the yuan’s trading
band to be widened.  The won strengthened 0.9 percent from Aug. 12 to 1,070.05
per dollar as of the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, the biggest jump
since May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. South
Korea’s financial markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.
The  Singapore dollar  rose 0.2 percent to S$1.2041. India’s rupee,
Indonesia’s rupiah and Thailand’s baht gained 0.1 percent to
45.29, 8,528 and 29.89, respectively.  “A rebound in global stocks eased  risk aversion  in the
market and when investors’ risk appetite improves, funds tend to
move into higher-yielding currencies,” said Tohru Nishihama, an
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index rose 0.2 percent, extending a 2
percent surge yesterday. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose
2.2 percent yesterday in  New York , capping its biggest three-day
gain since 2009.  A Federal Reserve report today will show industrial
production rose 0.5 percent in July after a 0.2 percent gain in
June, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Japan’s economy
shrank at an annualized 1.3 percent in the second quarter, the
government said yesterday. That was less than the 2.5 percent
drop estimated in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Yuan Band  China ’s yuan advanced 0.12 percent to 6.3830 per dollar,
the strongest level since the country unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993. The People’s Bank of
China fixed its reference rate at 6.3925 today, the highest
level since July 2005. The currency is allowed to trade as much
as 0.5 percent on either side of the daily fixing.  Widening the yuan trading band and increasing exchange-rate
flexibility will help damp one-way appreciation expectations and
deter capital inflows, the China Securities Journal wrote today.
The band was last widened, from 0.3 percent, in May 2007.  South Korea’s won touched a one-week high of 1,067.90 per
dollar as the Kospi index of shares rallied 4.8 percent, the
biggest one-day gain since January 2009.  The prospect of free-trade agreements with the world’s two
biggest economies may brighten the outlook for South Korea.
President  Lee Myung Bak  said yesterday an accord with the U.S.
is key to maintaining growth amid unprecedented economic
uncertainty and needs to be ratified soon. Trade Minister Kim
Jong Hoon said on Aug. 13 that preliminary talks with China
regarding a similar type of deal were under way.  Elsewhere,  Taiwan dollar ’s was little changed at NT$28.948
and the  Philippine peso  gained 0.1 percent to 42.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
