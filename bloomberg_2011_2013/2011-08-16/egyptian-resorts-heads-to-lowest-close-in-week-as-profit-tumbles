Egyptian Resorts Co. (EGTS) , a Red Sea
resorts developer, headed for the lowest close in a week after
first-half profit plunged.  Shares of the Cairo-based company slid 2 percent to 1
Egyptian pound at 11:42 p.m. in Cairo, poised for the lowest
close since Aug. 9. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  retreated 0.5
percent.  Profit for the period that ended June 30 fell 80 percent
from a year earlier, to 334,257 pounds ($56,000), the company
said yesterday in a filing to the Egyptian bourse.  Egyptian Resorts, which owns a 41 million square-meter plot
in Sahl Hasheesh, near the Egyptian resort town of Hurghada,
faces a court case against its purchase of the land because it
was not conducted through a public auction as stipulated by
Egyptian law. The case will resume Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
