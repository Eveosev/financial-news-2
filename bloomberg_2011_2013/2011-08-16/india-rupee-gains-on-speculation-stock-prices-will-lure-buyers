India’s rupee rebounded from a five-
month low on speculation a more than 6 percent drop in the
benchmark  stock index  this month will entice overseas investors.  The currency strengthened the most in three weeks as the
Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index rose 0.9 percent,
snapping a two-day decline. The rupee weakened for eight
consecutive days through Aug. 11, depreciating by almost 3
percent against the dollar.  “If you go by fundamentals the rupee offers value,” said
 Roy Paul , a deputy general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai. Most of the risks to stocks have been “overpriced,” he
said.  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 45.2075 per dollar as of
9:56 a.m. in Mumbai from the end of last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Markets were closed yesterday for a
holiday. The currency reached 45.4625 on Aug. 12, the weakest
level since March 17.  Offshore forwards indicate  India ’s currency will trade at
45.51 to the dollar in three months, compared with expectations
for a rate 45.65 at the end of last week. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
