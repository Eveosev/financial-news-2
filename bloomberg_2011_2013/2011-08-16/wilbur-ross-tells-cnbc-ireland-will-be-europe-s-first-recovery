Billionaire Wilbur Ross, chairman of
WL Ross & Co., said he is confident Ireland will be the first
European economy that recovers.  “We like Ireland very much because, unlike the Club Med
countries, it doesn’t need structural reform of the economy,”
Ross said today in an interview with CNBC. “All it really needs
is to get through the system the financial crisis that was
caused when its banks went berserk. But Ireland fundamentals are
still there.”  Ross, 73, said his firm has “great confidence that
Ireland’s economy, while it’s moribund right now, will be the
first in  Europe  to recover.”  Ross’s New York-based company manages about $10 billion in
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
