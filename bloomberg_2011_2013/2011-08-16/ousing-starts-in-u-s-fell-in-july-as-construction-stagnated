Builders began work on fewer homes in
July, indicating residential real estate is failing to contribute
to U.S. growth two years into an economic recovery.  Housing starts fell 1.5 percent to a 604,000 annual rate, in
line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, from June’s 613,000 pace that was less than previously
estimated, Commerce Department figures showed today in
Washington. Building permits, a proxy for future construction,
also dropped.  Falling sales, foreclosures and a lack of jobs may keep
delaying a rebound in homebuilding, depriving the world’s largest
economy of a source of strength seen in the early stages of past
recoveries. Concern over housing is prompting banks to maintain
strict mortgage lending rules and was one reason the  Federal
Reserve  said it would hold borrowing costs at a record low until
at least mid-2013.  “The housing market is still very depressed,” said  Patrick
Newport , an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
 Massachusetts . “Demand for new homes is extremely weak and the
foreclosure pipeline is still high. It’s because of the weak
economy, weak job growth and falling home prices.”  Prices of goods imported into the U.S. rose in July, led by
gains in costs of fuel, industrial supplies and clothing, another
report showed. The 0.3 percent gain in the import-price index
followed a revised 0.6 percent drop in June, Labor Department
figures showed.  Shares Fall  Stock-index futures held earlier losses after the report on
growing concern over a global growth slowdown after  Germany  said
its economy almost stalled in the second quarter. The contract on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.3 percent to 1,183.3 at
8:47 a.m. in  New York .  Treasury securities  rose, sending the
yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.27 percent from
2.31 percent late yesterday.  The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 77
economists called for a 600,000 annual pace of starts.
projections ranged from 570,000 to 650,000. The prior month was
revised from 629,000 previously estimated.  Housing starts so far this year are running on a 566,000
pace for all of 2011, according to Bloomberg calculations. The
result compares with last year’s tally of 587,000 starts, the
second-fewest on record. Home construction totaled 554,000 units
in 2009, the lowest since record-keeping began in 1959. During
the past decade’s housing boom, starts reached a peak of 2.07
million in 2005.  Fewer Permits  Permits decreased to a 597,000 annual pace. They were
projected to fall to a 605,000 annual rate from 617,000 the prior
month, according to the survey median.  Construction of single-family houses decreased 4.9 percent
to a 425,000 rate in July from the prior month, and permits rose
0.5 percent.  Work on multi-family homes, such as townhouses and apartment
builders, climbed 7.8 percent to an annual rate of 179,000.  The regional breakdown saw huge swings among two of the four
areas. Starts plunged 38 percent in the Midwest and jumped 35
percent in the Northeast. They rose 5.6 percent in the South and
fell 3 percent in the West.  There were 413,000 units under construction last month, the
fewest since records began in 1970.  Demand Drops  Builders have little incentive to take on more work.
Combined sales of new and previously owned homes dropped in June
to the lowest level of the year, according to reports from the
Commerce Department and the National Association of Realtors.  The median price of a single-family house fell in 109 of 150
metropolitan areas in the second quarter as foreclosures devalued
real estate, the Realtors group said in a report on Aug. 10.  “The housing sector remains depressed,” the  Federal Open
Market Committee  said in a statement after its meeting on Aug. 9.
“Economic growth so far this year has been considerably slower
than the Committee had expected.”  Bank-lending standards on home mortgages were little changed
for both prime and non-traditional loans during the second
quarter, the Fed said yesterday in its survey of senior loan
officers. In addition, about three-quarters of banks said they
expected the pace of mortgage lending “to remain at about the
same level through the rest of 2011,” the Fed said.  Credit Tight  The banks cited “reduced or unchanged demand from
creditworthy borrowers” as a factor. They also pointed to
“unfavorable or uncertain forecasts for the broad economy and
for  house prices .”  D.R. Horton Inc., the second-largest homebuilder by revenue,
reported third-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates as
cost cuts helped the  Fort Worth , Texas-based company to cushion a
decline in revenue.  “Nothing’s really strong out there, and I would reiterate
that most of our markets continue to still be soft, softer, and
softest,” Chief Executive Officer Donald Tomnitz said on a
conference call with investors on July 28. “I would anticipate
that ‘12 will be better than ‘11 but I don’t expect it to be
significantly better,” he said.  A measure of builder confidence held at 15 in August,
according to a report yesterday from the National Association of
Home Builders/Wells Fargo. Readings below 50 mean more
respondents said conditions were poor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
