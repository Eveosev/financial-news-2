The South African Post Office
investigation found irregular spending of 425 million rand ($60
million) and 19 million rand of wasteful expenditure in the
government-owned company, Business Day reported, citing
Chairwoman Vuyo Mahlati.  The funds relate to a lease contract for the companyâ€™s new
head office located in Centurion, south of the capital,
 Pretoria , the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. The Post Office
will honor the lease agreement while it is under review,
