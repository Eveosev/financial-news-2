Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced to a
one-week high on speculation foreigners will increase their
holdings of local assets to profit from growth in Southeast
Asia’s largest economy. Bonds rose.  Asian stocks climbed for a second day on optimism a meeting
between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  will result in action to contain Europe’s debt
crisis. Gross domestic product will increase 6.6 percent this
year after gaining 6.1 percent in 2010, Bank Indonesia forecast
Aug. 9. Overseas ownership of government bonds rose 23 percent
to 241.35 trillion rupiah ($28.3 billion) this year through Aug.
15, according to the debt management office.  “The economic fundamentals of Indonesia are very positive
so investors will remain interested,” said  Prakriti Sofat , a
regional economist at  Barclays Capital  in Singapore. ”The
rupiah is benefiting from a risk-on mode as the global equity
markets have ended on a positive note.”  The rupiah appreciated 0.1 percent to 8,528 per dollar as

The currency strengthened to 8,518 earlier, the strongest level
