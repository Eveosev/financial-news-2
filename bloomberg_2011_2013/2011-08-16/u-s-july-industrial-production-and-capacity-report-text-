Following is the text of the U.S.
 industrial production  and capacity utilization report for July.  Industrial production advanced 0.9 percent in July.
Although the index was revised down in April, primarily as a
result of a downward revision to the output of utilities,
stronger manufacturing output led to upward revisions to
production in both May and June.  Manufacturing output rose 0.6
percent in July, as the index for motor vehicles and parts
jumped 5.2 percent and production elsewhere moved up 0.3 percent.  The output of mines advanced 1.1 percent, and the output of
utilities increased 2.8 percent, as the extreme heat during the
month boosted air conditioning usage.  At 94.2 percent of its
2007 average, total industrial production for July was 3.7
percentage points above its year-earlier level.  The capacity
utilization rate for total industry climbed to 77.5 percent, a
rate 2.2 percentage points above the rate from a year earlier
but 2.9 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2010) average.  Market Groups  Production increased for all of the major market groups in
July.  The output of  consumer goods  advanced 1.1 percent; even
so, it was only 1.3 percent above its year-earlier level.
Consumer durables recorded a gain of 3.6 percent.  Automotive
products posted a jump of 5.9 percent to lead the increase in
durables, as motor vehicle output rebounded after the supply
chain disruptions that resulted from the earthquake in  Japan .
Output also increased for the other major components of durable
goods, with gains of nearly 1 percent or more in both home
electronics and miscellaneous goods.  The output of nondurable
consumer goods rose 0.5 percent.  Most of the increase of 1.5
percent in consumer energy products reflected the jump in
utility output.  The production of other nondurables edged up
0.1 percent, as a gain in foods and tobacco was mostly offset by
decreases in clothing and chemical products.  The production of business equipment increased 0.6 percent
in July and has gained 8.5 percent in the past 12 months.  All
of the major components of business equipment are substantially
above their levels of a year earlier.  In July, the indexes for
information processing equipment and transit equipment rose 1.0
percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while the index for
industrial and other equipment decreased 0.4 percent.  In July, the index for defense and space equipment
increased 0.6 percent after having fallen 1.1 percent in June.
Production for this market group has advanced, on net, since the
end of last year, though at a slower pace than during 2010.  The output of construction supplies increased 0.3 percent
in July, its second small monthly gain following a large jump in
May.  Over the past 12 months, the index for construction
supplies has moved up 4.4 percent; nevertheless, the index in
July remained more than 20 percent below its average level
during 2007.  The production of business supplies gained 0.8
percent in July; even so, it has increased only 1.3 percent
during the past 12 months and has reversed little of the decline
from late 2007 to early 2009.  The production of materials to be further processed in the
industrial sector rose 0.9 percent in July.  The output of
durable materials increased 0.7 percent and was up for a third
consecutive month.  Consumer parts recorded an increase of 1.0
percent in July after having moved up 2.8 percent in June.  The
output of equipment parts declined 0.2 percent after gains in
May and June of 1.3 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively; the
production of equipment parts has advanced 10.6 percent in the
past 12 months.  The output of nondurable materials edged up 0.1
percent in July.  Although the indexes for both textile and
paper materials increased about 3/4 percent, the output of
chemical materials only edged up, and the output of other
nondurable materials fell.  The output of energy materials rose
1.6 percent, with advances in the extraction of both natural gas
and crude oil accompanied by an increase in the output of
utilities.  Industry Groups  Manufacturing output increased 0.6 percent in July
following gains of 0.2 percent in both May and June. Capacity
utilization for manufacturing in July was 75.0 percent, a rate
10.6 percentage points above its trough in June 2009 but still
4.0 percentage points below its long-run average.  The production index for durable goods manufacturing rose
1.0 percent in July, its largest increase since jumping 1.7
percent in January. Among the major durable goods industries,
the largest gain was posted in motor vehicles and parts; in
addition, primary metals and aerospace and miscellaneous
transportation equipment both rose more than 1.0 percent.  The
only decreases last month were posted by electrical equipment,
appliances, and components and by miscellaneous manufacturing.
The overall index for durable manufacturing was 6.6 percent
above its year-earlier level.  The index for nondurable manufacturing increased 0.3
percent in July.  The largest increases were for food, beverage,
and tobacco products; printing and support; and plastics and
rubber products, while the only decreases were recorded for
apparel and leather products and for chemicals.  Nondurable
manufacturing stood at 1.7 percent above its year-earlier level.  The production index for mining increased 1.1 percent in
July; its gains averaged about 1.0 percent during the preceding
four months.  Capacity utilization in mining rose to 90.3
percent, a rate 2.9 percentage points above its long-run average.
The increase in output of 2.8 percent for utilities boosted its
operating rate to 81.0 percent, but utilization remained 5.6
percentage points below its long-run average.  Capacity utilization rates in July at industries grouped by
stage of process were as follows:  At the  crude stage,
utilization increased 0.7 percentage point to 88.5 percent, a
rate 2.1 percentage points above  its long-run average; at the
primary and semifinished stages, utilization rose 0.7 percentage
point to 74.7  percent, a rate 6.6 percentage points below its
long-run average; and at the finished stage, utilization
increased 0.5 percentage point to 76.3 percent, a rate 1.0
percentage point below its long-run average. Explanatory Note  The Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
statistical release, which is published around the middle of the
month, reports measures of output, capacity, and capacity
utilization in manufacturing, mining, and the electric and gas
utilities industries.  More detailed descriptions of industrial
production and capacity utilization are available on the Boardâ€™s
website at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17. In addition, the
website includes files containing data shown in the release,
more detailed series that are published in a monthly supplement
to the G.17, and historical data.  Instructions on searching for
and downloading specific series are provided as well.  Industrial Production  Release Schedule  At 9:15 a.m. on
