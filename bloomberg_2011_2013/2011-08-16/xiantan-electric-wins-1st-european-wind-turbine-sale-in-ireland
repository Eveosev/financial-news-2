Xiangtan Electric Manufacturing
Corp., a Chinese electric equipment maker, won its first wind
turbine sale in  Europe  with a deal worth 18 million euros ($26
million) to develop farms with Gaelectric Holdings in Ireland.  The agreement covers co-development and turbine supply for
three sites totaling 13.6 megawatts of  wind energy  in Roscommon,
Offaly and Westmeath, Gaelectric said in a statement. State-run
Xiangtan Electric also signed a letter of intent to develop
Gaelectric’s pipeline of wind projects in Ireland, it said.  They are also working on offshore wind power, Brendan McGrath, chief executive officer of Dublin-based Gaelectric,
said in the statement. Xiangtan Electric is testing a 5-megawatt
gearless turbine in the Netherlands for deployment at sea.  The Chinese company, which bought Dutch wind-turbine maker
Darwind in 2009, makes direct drive turbines that reduce weight
and maintenance costs, according to the statement.  Chinese turbine makers are seeking to expand in Europe as
the region adds wind farms to cut reliance on fossil fuels.
Sinovel Wind Group Co. agreed a deal with Ireland’s Mainstream
Renewable Power Ltd. in July and teamed up with Athens-based
Public Power Corp. SA to develop plants in  Greece  in April.  “Chinese wind turbine manufacturers see Europe as a key
target market,” Justin Wu, an analyst of wind energy at
Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said by e-mail. “The level of
activity will only pick up in the next few years.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
