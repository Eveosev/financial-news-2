President  Barack Obama  said
Republican Rick Perry should be “a little more careful” with
his public statements as a presidential candidate after the
Texas governor stirred controversy with comments about the
 Federal Reserve  and military respect for the commander-in-chief.  In getting his campaign for the White House under way,
Perry has spoken of wanting a president who loves America, and
yesterday he said it would be “almost treasonous” for Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke to allow any additional
monetary stimulus before the election.  In an interview with CNN, Obama was asked whether Perry was
disrespectful in another comment he made at an Iowa Republican
dinner on Aug. 14 where he said members of the military want a
commander in chief who has served in the armed forces.  As a presidential candidate, “you’ve got to be a little
more careful about what you say,” Obama said in the  CNN 
interview. “But I’ll cut him some slack. He’s only been at it
for a few days now.”  Obama said he hasn’t been giving the candidates running for
the Republican presidential nomination “too much thought.”  “I’ll let them winnow it down a little bit, at least let
them decide who they want their standard-bearer to be,” Obama
said. “Then I’ll be ready for them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
