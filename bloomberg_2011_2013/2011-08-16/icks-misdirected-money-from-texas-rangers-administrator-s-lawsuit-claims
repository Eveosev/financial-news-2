Former  Texas Rangers  owner  Tom Hicks 
misdirected “tens of millions” of dollars from the Major League
Baseball franchise to buy and develop parking lots near the
club’s ballpark, according to a lawsuit by the team’s post-
bankruptcy administrator.  Alan Jacobs, the administrator, said Hicks “embarked on a
scheme to build a real estate empire on the backs of the  Texas 
Rangers’ players and creditors and fans of the team,” according
to a complaint filed yesterday in state court in Dallas.  Hicks owned the club from 1998 to the summer of 2010, when
it filed for bankruptcy and was sold to a group led by Hall-of-
Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan. Hicks’s Ballpark Real Estate LP now
generates several million dollars a year in parking revenue near
the ballpark and the  Dallas  Cowboys football stadium, and could
be worth $100 million or more, according to the complaint.  “The lawsuit reflects a bizarre flip-flop on the part of
the complainants, a group led by a distressed debt hedge fund,”
Lisa LeMaster, a spokeswoman for Hicks, said in a statement. “We
welcome the opportunity to challenge these allegations in
court.”  The case is Texas Rangers Baseball Partners v. Hicks,
DC-11-10069, 116th Judicial District Court, Dallas County,
Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
