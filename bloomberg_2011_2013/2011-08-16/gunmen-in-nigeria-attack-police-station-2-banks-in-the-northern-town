Gunmen in  Nigeria  suspected to be
Islamic militants hurled explosives at a police station and
attacked two banks in the northeastern town of Gamawa late
yesterday, Police Commissioner Ikechukwu Aduba, in charge of
Bauchi state, said today by telephone from the city of Bauchi.  Police returned fire, driving off the gunmen that had
earlier raided two banks, stealing sacks of money, he said.  Nigerian authorities  have blamed a militant Islamic group,
Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan â€™s Taliban
movement, for an upsurge in violent attacks in the mainly Muslim
north in the past two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
