South Korea ’s banking regulator
urged financial holding companies to improve asset quality to
tackle potential risks amid global market turmoil.  The companies need to diversify foreign-currency funding
sources as South Korean banks are too dependent on European and
U.S. banks,  Financial Services Commission  Chairman Kim Seok Dong
said today at a meeting with chief executive officers of the
country’s major financial holding companies.  Kim also urged banks to provide funding to companies as
usual to support the economy, according to e-mailed text of his
speech to the CEOs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
