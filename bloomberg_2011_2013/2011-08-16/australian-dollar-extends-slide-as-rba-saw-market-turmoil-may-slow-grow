The Australian dollar extended
declines after the  Reserve Bank  said in minutes of this monthâ€™s
policy meeting that it held  interest rates  unchanged on concern
that turmoil on financial markets could slow global growth.  The so-called Aussie fell to $1.0466 as of 11:34 a.m. in
Sydney, from $1.0480 before the minutes were released and
$1.0507 yesterday in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
