Oil advanced from a two-day low in
New York as investors bet that shrinking fuel stockpiles in the
U.S. indicate demand will increase in the world’s biggest crude-
consuming nation.  Futures climbed as much as 0.7 percent after the industry-
funded  American Petroleum Institute  said gasoline supplies fell
the most in five months. An Energy Department report today may
show gasoline and crude inventories slid last week. U.S.
producer prices may have rebounded in July.  The drop in gasoline stockpiles is “price supportive,
there’s no doubt about it, but I don’t think you can read too
much into it at the moment,” said  Jonathan Barratt , a managing
director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who
predicts oil in New York will average $100 a barrel this year.
“I’d prefer to see what the Energy Department come out with.
The market will watch to see how we go with producer prices and
the inventory data.”  Crude for September delivery rose as much as 61 cents to
$87.26 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange and was at $86.85 at 10:57 a.m. Sydney time. The
contract yesterday slipped 1.4 percent to $86.65, the lowest
since Aug. 12. Prices are 15 percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for October settlement was at $109.27 a barrel,
up 14 cents, on the ICE Futures  Europe  in  London . The contract
yesterday dropped 71 cents to $109.13. September oil, which
expired yesterday, fell 0.4 percent to $109.47.  Fuel Supplies  Gasoline stockpiles fell 5.37 million barrels to 205.8
million last week, according to the report from the American
Petroleum Institute. It was the biggest decline since the week
ended March 18. Distillate supplies slid 1.29 million barrels.  U.S. crude-oil inventories rose 1.75 million barrels, the
API data showed. An Energy Department report today may show
crude supplies slipped 500,000 barrels and gasoline stockpiles
dropped 1.2 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of analysts.  The API collects stockpile data on a voluntary basis from
operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed for its weekly survey.
Oil-supply totals from the API and the department have moved in
the same direction 71 percent of the time in the past year and
75 percent in the past four years.  The U.S. producer price index probably climbed 0.1 percent
in July after declining 0.4 percent the prior month, according
to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey before
a report today.  Tropical Storm Gert degenerated in the North Atlantic far
from land, while Tropical Storm Fernanda gained strength in the
eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
