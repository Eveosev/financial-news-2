U.S. stocks may slip to new lows in
the next few weeks, setting the stage for a rally of more than
20 percent in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, said Tom DeMark,
the creator of indicators meant to identify turning points in
the price of securities.  The  S&P 500 , which closed at 1,192.76 yesterday, will
probably drop below the 11-month low of 1,119.46 set on Aug. 8
before surging above 1,363.61, its peak on April 29, DeMark said
during an interview in London today. The rebound may last two to
three months and also push the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  and
 Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)  above their 2011 highs, DeMark said.
European banks including Societe Generale SA “look like buys”
after the shares tumbled this month, he said.  “We’re at the point right now where the next trip down
will probably generate a buy signal,” said DeMark, the founder
of Market Studies LLC. “Everything we follow is indicating the
Dow Jones and the S&P should make a minor new recovery high, and
probably the  Nasdaq , too.”  U.S. stocks posted unprecedented swings last week as
investors weighed signs of a resilient economy against the first
downgrade of America’s top credit rating by S&P and  Europe ’s
debt crisis. While markets are driven by the economy, prices
tend to move in patterns that help traders identify the best
times to buy and sell, according to DeMark.  Cohen, Soros  DeMark has spent more than 40 years developing market
indicators -- with names like Sequential and Countdown -- and
advised  hedge funds  including Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital
Advisors LP, George Soros’s Soros Fund Management LLC and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors Inc., according to the Market Studies
 website .  The S&P 500 plunged 6.7 percent on Aug. 8, before surging
4.7 percent, dropping 4.4 percent and jumping 4.6 percent in the
next three days.  Societe Generale (GLE)  and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, both based
in Paris, sank to the lowest levels since 2009 on Aug. 10.
Societe Generale has since rallied 14 percent, while BNP Paribas
gained 5.3 percent and Zurich-based  UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s
biggest lender, advanced 17 percent.  “We’ve got the European banks all bottoming right now,”
DeMark said. “SocGen, BNP, they all look like buys.”  DeMark said during an interview in January that U.S. stocks
were within weeks of “a significant market top.” The S&P 500
sank 1 percent the next day, the most in two months. It then
rose 4.8 percent to close at 1,343.01 on Feb. 18 before dropping
6.4 percent to 1,256.88 through March 16.  Equity indexes are unlikely to climb back soon to the
record highs reached in October 2007 given that the longer-term
trend for stocks is bearish, DeMark said. The S&P 500 closed at
an all-time high of 1,565.15 that month.  “The overall trend is down,” he said. “You might be able
to squeeze out minor new highs in spite of that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
