TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD)  said
some of its clients are experiencing issues with electronic
trades after the company integrated its Thinkorswim options
broker this past weekend.  “In general the integration has gone well, with all
clients able to place trades on our platforms,” Kim Hillyer, a
spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade, wrote in an e-mail to Bloomberg
News. “However, we are experiencing some issues, impacting a
subset of clients and their ability to place trades
electronically.”  Hillyer said she couldn’t give further details about the
issues. She said Omaha, Nebraska-based TD Ameritrade identified
the problem and is “actively working to resolve it.”  The online broker brought more than 250,000 Thinkorswim
accounts to the TD Ameritrade platform in the final  integration 
last weekend, according to Hillyer. TD Ameritrade bought options
brokerage Thinkorswim Group Inc. for $749 million in 2009 to
expand beyond equities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
