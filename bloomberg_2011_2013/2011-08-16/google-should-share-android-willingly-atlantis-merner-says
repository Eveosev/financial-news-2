Edwin Merner, president of Atlantis
Investment Research Corp. in  Tokyo , which manages about $3
billion in assets, comments on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s proposed $12.5
billion purchase of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.  “The major question is will Android become the standard?
It seems likely, but they must be willing to share and let the
other mobile makers use the Android freely.  “Many of the makers using Android have tweaked the system
to fit their phones and this means that there can be problems
when trying to communicate with other Android users.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
