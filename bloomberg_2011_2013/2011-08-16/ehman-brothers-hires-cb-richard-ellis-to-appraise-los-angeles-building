Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the
defunct investment bank trying to boost real estate sales to
help pay creditors, won a judge’s permission to hire  CB Richard
Ellis Group Inc. (CBG)  to appraise an office building in Los Angeles.  Lehman gained control of the property at 1000 Wilshire
Boulevard and other buildings in 2009 when a joint-venture
partner needed an extension of loans advanced by Lehman before
its 2008 bankruptcy. Lehman needs to appraise the Wilshire
property to foreclose on the loan, which is in default, or
exercise “other remedies,” the company has said.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in Manhattan signed an
order yesterday authorizing the hiring of the Los Angeles-based
real estate firm, according to a filing.  Lehman valued its real estate assets at $13.2 billion in a
court filing detailing a $65 billion liquidation plan. Real
estate sales will run through 2014, New York-based Lehman said
in the June filing. Through March, proceeds from real estate
sales totaled $3 billion, it said.  In June, the firm sold an office building at 1107 Broadway
in Manhattan for $190.8 million to Steven Witkoff, chairman and
chief executive officer of New York-based Witkoff Group.  The case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
