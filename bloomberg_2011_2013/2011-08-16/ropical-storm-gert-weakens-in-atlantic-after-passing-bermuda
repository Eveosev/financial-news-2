Tropical Storm Gert weakened after
passing  Bermuda  yesterday and is heading northeast into the
Atlantic, while a system in the east Caribbean is unlikely to
form a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center said.  Gert, 410 miles (660 kilometers) northwest of Bermuda,
moved at a faster pace of 22 miles per hour and lower intensity,
with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, the Miami-based center
said in a  statement  released at 3:35 a.m. local time. Storm
force winds extended  70 miles from the core.  The storm, which posed no threat to land, would move east-
northeast and accelerate in the next few days, it said.  In the Caribbean, a weather system known as a “tropical
wave” that is producing thunderstorms shows no signs of
developing into a cyclone at present.  “It is not yet a threat but we still want to monitor it
over the next two days, given that a northern deviation would
then take it to  Mexico ’s Bay of Campeche,” said  Olivier Jakob ,
managing director of researcher Petromatrix GmbH, in an e-mailed
note today.  In the Pacific, a low pressure system is likely to form a
tropical storm in the next two days. It’s located a “few
hundred miles” southeast of  Acapulco , Mexico as it moves west-
northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, according to a  statement  issued
at 7:40 a.m. Miami time.  Elsewhere in the Pacific, Tropical Depression Six-E had a
“good chance” of becoming a tropical storm, while not posing a
threat to land, according to an  advisory  issued at 2 a.m. Los
Angeles time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
