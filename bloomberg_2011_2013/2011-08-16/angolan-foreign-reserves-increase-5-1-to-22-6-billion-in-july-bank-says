Angola ’s foreign-exchange reserves
increased 5.1 percent in July from a month earlier, a central
bank preliminary document obtained by Bloomberg News today
showed.  Reserves rose to $22.6 billion from a revised figure of
$21.5 billion in June, the document from the Luanda-based Banco
Nacional de Angola showed.  Reserves in Angola, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second biggest oil
producer, have been boosted by higher  oil prices . Angola delayed
issuing its first international bond, originally planned for
September, because it doesn’t currently have “difficulties in
its treasury,” Carlos Feijo, the country’s minister of state,
said July 27. A decline in reserves to about $12 billion in 2010
due to lower oil prices was one of the reasons the government
was slow in repaying outstanding debt to construction companies
who helped rebuild infrastructure after the end of civil war in
2002.  The increase in reserves should make it easier for the
government to cut the debt to contractors, Susana Santos, an
economist at Banco BPI in  Portugal , said in a telephone
interview.  “Angola now has a very comfortable financial position in
terms of its reserves,” Santos, who co-authors a quarterly
report on Angola, said.  Angola still owes $2.7 billion of an original $6.8 billion
to building companies, Finance Minister Carlos Alberto Lopes
said July 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
