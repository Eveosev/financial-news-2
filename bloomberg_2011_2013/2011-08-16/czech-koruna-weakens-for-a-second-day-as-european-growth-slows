The koruna weakened a second day
after second-quarter economic growth in the euro area slowed
more than analysts expected and a Czech policy maker said it was
difficult to endorse an increase in  interest rates .  The koruna weakened 0.3 percent to 24.395 versus the
European common currency as of 2:30 p.m. in Prague, adding to a
0.5 percent retreat yesterday. The currency has lost 0.9 percent
versus the euro this month.  European shares fell and most emerging-market currencies
weakened after a report today showed gross domestic product in
the euro region, the main market for Czech exports, rose 0.2
percent from the previous three months, the worst performance
since 2009. Czech quarterly GDP growth slowed to 0.2 percent
from 0.9 percent, a separate report showed.  “The Czech economy has probably exhausted its post-crisis
boom and lacks new impulses,” Patrik Rozumbersky, an economist
at UniCredit SpA in  Prague , wrote in a report today. “Demand
from abroad shows signs of a cooldown” while “domestic demand
is damped by the government’s fiscal-austerity measures.”  Czech central bank Vice Governor Mojmir Hampl said in an
interview for Hospodarske Noviny newspaper today it’s hard to
find reasons to lift funding costs at present as the global
financial crisis isn’t yet over and there are prevailing anti-
inflationary risks to the Czech economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
