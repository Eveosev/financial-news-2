Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki
called for more frequent talks between East African leaders to
strengthen relations among countries in the region, according to
the Ugandan president’s office.  Afewerki held talks today with his Ugandan counterpart,
Yoweri Museveni, during a state visit to the capital, Kampala.
The discussions focused on “strategic and political issues” in
the region and bilateral agreements, Museveni said in the
statement e-mailed.  “Apart from the political and security issues, there are
other issues of cooperation in the region, including in trade,
exchange in education, regional flights” and others, Museveni
said.  Eritrea may be providing financial and logistical support
to armed opposition groups in  Uganda , along with countries
including Somalia, Djibouti and  Ethiopia , according to a report
last month by the United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia and
Eritrea.  The UN has also accused Eritrea’s government of multiple
breaches of Security Council resolutions, including a plan to
bomb an African Union summit in  Addis Ababa , the Ethiopian
capital, in January. Eritrea’s government has denied any
involvement.  Afewerki was accompanied by Foreign Minister Osman Saleh
and the head of Eritrea’s political affairs office, Yamane
Ghebreab, according to the Ugandan presidency statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
