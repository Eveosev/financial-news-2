Egypt  said it found a natural-gas
field in the Western Desert with an estimated daily output of 12
million cubic feet (339,802 cubic meters) of the fuel and 5,000
barrels of condensates.  Production at the site probably will start in November, the
Oil Ministry said today in a faxed statement.  Egypt holds  Africa ’s sixth-largest crude oil reserves, with
4.5 billion barrels, and the continent’s third-biggest gas
reserves, with 78 trillion cubic feet (2.2 trillion cubic
meters), according to data from BP Plc.  The country’s output reached 736,000 barrels a day of oil
and 61.3 billion cubic meters of gas last year, according to the
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
