Amlak Finance PJSC, the Islamic
mortgage company that’s being reorganized by the United Arab
Emirates government, said its second-quarter loss widened on
higher impairment charges.  The net loss swelled to 52.2 million dirhams ($14 million)
from 597,000 dirhams a year earlier, according to a  statement 
today. Impairments on Islamic financing and investing assets
jumped to 61.2 million dirhams from 29.7 million dirhams.  Revenue declined 12 percent to about 148 million dirhams
“as a result of no new business origination over the past two
years continuing into 2011 and further mortgage rate cuts
offered to existing customers,” the company said.  Shares of Amlak and  Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) , another Dubai-based
Islamic mortgage company, were suspended in November 2008 after
the global crisis froze credit markets and blocked the lenders’
access to borrowings that funded their loans. Tamweel’s shares
resumed trading on May 10 after  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) 
increased its stake in the company to 58.3 percent from 21
percent in September and added new funds.  A federal government committee that’s studying an overhaul
of Amlak “continues to explore the possibilities of a balance-
sheet restructuring,” the company reiterated today.   Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , Dubai’s biggest developer, owns 45
percent of Amlak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
