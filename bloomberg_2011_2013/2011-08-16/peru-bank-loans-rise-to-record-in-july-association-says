Peru’s outstanding bank loans rose
to a record 121 billion soles ($44.1 billion) as of July 31, the
Andean country’s banking association Asbanc said.  Outstanding loans rose 20 percent in July from a year
earlier,  Asbanc  said in an e-mailed statement. Annual loan
growth will probably rise 17 percent to 22 percent this year as
more Peruvians gain access to credit, the Lima-based association
said.  The loan delinquency rate declined 0.27 percentage point
last month from a year earlier to 1.54 percent, Asbanc said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
