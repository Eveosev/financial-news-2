Daytime weekday viewership of the
London Olympics has averaged 7.1 million, a 31 percent jump from
2008 and a record for non-U.S. Summer Games,  NBC Universal  said.  The audience totaled 212.7 million as of Aug. 10, making it
the second-most watched event in U.S.  television  history, NBC
said in an e-mailed statement today. With the closing ceremony
tonight, the London Games can surpass the 215 million viewers of
the 2008 Beijing Olympics, said NBC, a unit of  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)   “Every weekday daytime telecast from the London Olympics
has topped the viewership of the comparable day in Beijing,”
the network said in the statement.  NBC said 5.4 million U.S. viewers watched the daytime
coverage in Beijing, the fourth-best weekday audience for non-
U.S. Summer Games. Barcelona ranked second in 1992 with average
viewership of 5.9 million, while Seoul was third in 1988 with
5.5 million.  Primetime coverage of the Olympics averaged 31.1 million
viewers in the first 16 nights, the most of any non-U.S.  Summer
Olympics  since  Montreal  in 1976, according to NBC.  On Aug. 2, NBC Sports Chairman Mark Lazarus said he saw a
“small chance” for a profit on the media company’s coverage of
the London Olympics because of larger TV audiences and higher-
than-projected advertising sales.  NBC paid about $1.18 billion for U.S. TV rights to the
Olympics.  Shares of Philadelphia-based Comcast rose 18 cents to
$34.73 in trading on Aug. 10, and are up 47 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
