Billionaire Christo Wiese, the
chairman of Africa’s largest food retailer  Shoprite Holdings
Ltd. (SHP) , owes South Africa’s tax authorities about 2 billion rand
($247 million) in tax and penalties, the  Sunday Times  said.  The amount includes a 1 billion-rand charge in tax that the
 South African Revenue Services  believes Wiese under-declared and
the rest is penalties, the Johannesburg-based paper reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Wiese denies owing the money and said he has paid taxes
throughout his 50-year business career, according to the paper.  Telephone calls to Wiese’s Titan Nominees (Pty) Ltd. Cape
Town offices weren’t answered outside normal work hours. South
African Revenue Services doesn’t comment on private taxpayers,
spokesman Adrian Lackay said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha in
