Nakheel PJSC, the builder of
artificial islands off Dubai’s coast, said it sold a plot of
land on Palm Jumeirah for 400 million dirhams ($109 million).  The 305,704 square-foot plot was bought by a local investor
the company didn’t identify. “There are clear signs of renewed
investor confidence in Dubai real estate and in particular for
unique products such as those offered on Palm Jumeirah,’’ the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. “We have seen a
very healthy demand in the first half of 2012, and this looks
set to continue for the year.”  Nakheel said on July 30 it posted a 37 percent increase in
first half profit as sales increased and it cut costs. The
company restructured $16 billion of debt after Dubai’s property
market collapsed following the onset of the global financial
crisis in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
