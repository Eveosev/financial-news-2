Iraq signed a contract with  COWI , a
Lyngby, Denmark-based consultant, for the design of a highway
linking  Baghdad  with  Turkey , an official from the Ministry of
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction said.  The consultant is due to complete preliminary designs
within 20 weeks before working on final designs, Sameer Bashaqa,
director of the general committee for roads and bridges at the
ministry, said by phone from Baghdad.  Iraq plans to spend $9.8 billion on roads, bridges and
housing through 2016 as the war-torn country’s budget doubles on
higher oil production, Mohammad Saheb al-Darraji, minister of
construction and housing, said in a May 21 interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
