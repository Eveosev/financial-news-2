Shareholders of Easyjet Plc may
reject founder  Stelios Haji-Ioannou ’s effort to oust Chairman
Mike Rake at a meeting tomorrow, according to the Sunday Times.  A majority of shareholders will probably vote against
Rake’s removal, proposed by Haji-Ioannou after the Libor
scandal, the newspaper said, citing people it didn’t identify.
Rake is also deputy chairman of Barclays Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
