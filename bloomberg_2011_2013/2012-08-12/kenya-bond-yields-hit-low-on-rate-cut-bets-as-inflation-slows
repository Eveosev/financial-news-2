Kenyan bonds are rallying, pushing
down yields to a record, on speculation that central bank
Governor Njuguna Ndung’u will follow the first  interest rate  cut
in 18 months with further reductions as inflation slows.  Yields on Kenya’s 12.705 percent shilling notes due June
2022 have dropped 157 basis points, or 1.57 percentage points,
to 12.63 percent, their lowest since they were sold in June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on 11.855
percent securities due May 2017 are down as much as 38 basis
points this month to 12.44 percent, the lowest since May 28.  Inflation in the $34 billion economy, East  Africa ’s
largest, slowed for an eighth month in July to 7.7 percent, the
Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said on July 31. Ndung’u
reduced the benchmark lending rate by 1.5 percentage points to
16.5 percent on July 5 to help boost the economy, which grew 3.5
percent in the first quarter, the slowest pace in two years. The
Central Bank of  Kenya ’s next monetary policy meeting is
scheduled for Sept. 5.  “The next rate decision should see the monetary policy
committee take a bold STEP,” Fred Mweni, chief executive
officer of Nairobi-based Tsavo Securities Ltd., said in a phone
interview on AUG. 10. “Key macro-economic indicators show that
the central bank should slash its benchmark rate.”  While Kenyan yields are falling, they are high relative to
 South Africa , where rates on the government’s 6.75 percent
securities due March 2021 have averaged 7.6 percent this year,
reaching a record low of 6.48 percent on July 20. South Africa’s
$408 billion economy is sub-Saharan Africa’s largest.  Yields Tumble  Yields in emerging market bonds are tumbling as  Europe ’s
worsening debt crisis prompts investors to seek the safety of
government debt, pushing lower yields in some developed markets
to near-zero. In neighboring  Uganda , borrowing costs are also
coming down as inflation slows, with yields on the nation’s
10.75 percent notes due January 2017 falling 99 basis points to
14.41 percent through Aug. 10, according to Standard Chartered
Plc.  Kenya’s  inflation  rate surged to a record 19.7 percent in
November after a drought caused food prices to soar. The central
boosted its main lending rate by 12 percentage points last year
to curb inflation and bolster the currency after it slumped to a
record low of 106.75 per dollar on Oct. 11. The shilling has
strengthened 21 percent since its worst level to trade at 84.10
as of 4:53 p.m. on Aug. 10. The country’s  interbank  lending rate
has declined 17 percentage points this year to 10 percent on
Aug. 10.  All those factors give the central bank the room to lower
rates to 12.5 percent at the next meeting, Tsavo’s Mweni said.
Yields on Kenya’s 2022 notes dropped six basis points to 12.68
percent at 4:04 p.m. in Nairobi on Aug. 10, while rates on its
2017 bonds declined three basis points to 12.5 percent.  Trading Surges  Trading in local Kenyan debt also is rising. The volume of
bonds traded on the  Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSEASI)  surged to a
daily average of 5 billion shillings ($59 million) last week,
compared with 1 billion shillings the prior week, according to
Samuel Maikweki, a fixed-income trader at Nairobi-based Sterling
Capital Ltd.  “The fall in inflation has elicited positive responses
from the secondary  securities market , spurring investor
activity,” Duncan Kinuthia, a trader at Nairobi-based
Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone. “The prospects
are good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
