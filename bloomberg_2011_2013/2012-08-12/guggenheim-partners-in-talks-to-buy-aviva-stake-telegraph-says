The life insurance unit of
Guggenheim Partners is in talks with  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to
buy some or all of  Aviva (AV/)  USA, the Sunday Telegraph said.  The discussions value Aviva USA at 800 million pounds ($1.3
billion), the London newspaper reported, without saying how it
got the information. Guggenheim is interested in Avivaâ€™s fixed-
annuity business in the U.S., it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
