Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) ,
India’s third-largest mobile-phone company, reported first-
quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates as rising
competition and finance costs squeezed margins.  Net income  rose 3.2 percent to 1.62 billion rupees ($29
million) in the three months ended June 30, from 1.57 billion
rupees a year  earlier , the Mumbai-based company said in a
statement on Aug. 11. That lagged behind the 1.84 billion-rupee
median of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Billionaire  Anil Ambani ’s flagship company joins  Bharti
Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  in reporting profits that missed estimates as
competition curbed margins in the world’s second-largest market
for mobile services, and finance costs rose. Reliance’s share of
wireless subscribers dropped for three consecutive months, while
Bharti and the Indian unit of  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  increased their
share.  “Competition is affecting Reliance Communications and all
the incumbents,” Ankita Somani, an analyst at Angel Broking
Ltd. in Mumbai, said before the earnings announcement. “What
I’m worried about is that Reliance provides a lot of free
minutes in its network -- there are a lot of subscribers getting
those, not contributing anything to revenue.”  Shares of Reliance fell 0.4 percent to 54.70 rupees in
Mumbai on Aug. 10, compared with little change in the benchmark
 Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex. The  stock  has lost 22 percent this
year, compared with a 14 percent jump in the Sensex. Bharti has
declined 26 percent.  Reliance’s market share fell to 16.55 percent at the end of
June from 16.65 percent at the end of March, according to
 India ’s telecommunications regulator. Bharti increased its share
to 20.05 percent from 19.72 percent in the same period.  Revenue rose 8.5 percent to 52.6 billion rupees, from 48.5
billion rupees a year earlier. That missed the 53.7 billion-
rupee median of 21 analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Finance cost rose 35 percent to 5.5 billion rupees during
the period, according to the statement.  Reliance had 155 million connections at the end of June,
according to the nation’s telecommunications regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
