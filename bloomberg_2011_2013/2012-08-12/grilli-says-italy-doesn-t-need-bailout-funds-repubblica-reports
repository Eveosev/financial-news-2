Italian Finance Minister  Vittorio Grilli  said the country doesn’t need to tap Europe’s bailout
funds, la Repubblica reported, citing an interview.  “The European Central Bank’s toolbox, once operative, will
substantially reduce tension on bond spreads,” Grilli was cited
as saying.  Grilli said he won’t introduce more measures to reduce the
nominal deficit this year as cuts would further weaken the
economy, according to the newspaper.  He said the government is studying all options to reduce
the nation’s debt while ruling out a wealth tax and selling
stakes in state-owned companies  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) , Enel SpA and
 Eni SpA (ENI)  at current market prices, la Repubblica reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
