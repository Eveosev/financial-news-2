Sigmar Gabriel, the chairman of
 Germany ’s main opposition  Social Democratic Party , said Swiss
banks are involved in “organized crime” that fosters tax
evasion, according to an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio
station.  An agreement between Switzerland and Germany is “full of
holes” and allows tax evaders to pre-emptively put their funds
out of reach of authorities, Gabriel said, according to a
 transcript  of the interview on the German station’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
