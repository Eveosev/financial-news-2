FirstGroup Plc (FGP)  will win a 14-year
contract to run the U.K.â€™s West Coast mainline train service,
the Sunday Telegraph  said , without saying where it got the
information.  FirstGroup offered as much as 7 billion pounds ($11
billion) to run the service, outbidding current operator Virgin
Trains by about 1 billion pounds, the newspaper said. The
Department for Transport is expected to award the contract to
FirstGroup this week, according to the report.  The department said in a statement today that a decision on
the future of the franchise has not yet been taken and would be
made shortly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
