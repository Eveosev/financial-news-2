Michael Phelps  is trading in his
swimsuit to play golf with  Tiger Woods ’s former coach.  Phelps, 27, who is retiring from Olympic swimming after
collecting a record 22 medals, including 18 golds, will work to
improve his golf game alongside Hank Haney on a Golf Channel
reality show.  The Haney Project will follow Phelps beginning in September
as he attempts to improve his game while playing some of the
U.S.’s top golf courses. The show will begin airing in February,
Phelps and the Golf Channel announced in a statement.  “I have traveled the world through swimming, but really
haven’t had an opportunity to experience the world through my
travels,” Phelps said in the statement. “I want to play all
the world’s great golf courses, but I’d like to play them
well.”  Haney, who quit as Woods’s coach in May 2010, has
previously coached Hall of Fame basketball player  Charles Barkley , actor Ray Romano and singer Adam Levine on the show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
