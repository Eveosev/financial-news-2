Iraq’s crude-oil production has
risen to 3.2 million barrels a day and will increase as planned
to 3.4 million barrels a day by year’s end Deputy Prime Minister
for Energy Affairs Hussain al-Shahristani said.  The country’s output has now surpassed that of Iran and
 Kuwait , al-Shahristani told reporters today in  Baghdad . The
figure would be the highest level in more than 20 years.  Crude oil pumped from fields in the northern Kurdish region
“remains less than required, at a total of 116,000 barrels
since Aug. 8,” when pumping from the area resumed, he said. The
semi-autonomous area halted pumping for export April 1 following
a dispute with the central government over payments to foreign
companies. The requirement for the region is 175,000 barrels a
day, al-Shahristani said.  “Payments to foreign companies will be made once we
receive the required documents on the required levels,” al-
Shahristani said.  Iraq will “terminate business with any foreign energy
company that violates Iraqi laws,” he said, referring to
contracts signed by overseas firms such as Exxon Mobile Corp.
and  Total SA (FP)  with the Kurdish region, separately from the
central government.  “In the last few days, we met with representatives from
 Exxon Mobil (XOM)  and they confirmed the commitment of the company
that they would not start any field development work in
Kurdistan,” al-Shahristani said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
