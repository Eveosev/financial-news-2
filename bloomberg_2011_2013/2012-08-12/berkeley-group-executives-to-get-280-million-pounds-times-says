Executives at Berkeley Group
Holdings Plc stand to make 280 million pounds ($439 million) if
they deliver on a plan to pay 1.7 billion pounds to shareholders
over nine years, the Sunday Times reported.  Chairman Tony Pidgley, Managing Director Rob Perrins and
four other executives will share the bonus approved by
shareholders last year, the London newspaper said. The figures
are based on last weekâ€™s closing share price, according to the
Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
