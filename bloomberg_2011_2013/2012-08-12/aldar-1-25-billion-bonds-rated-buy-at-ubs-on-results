Aldar Properties PJSC, (ALDAR)  the  Abu Dhabi 
developer that was bailed out by the government last year, had
its 2014 bonds rated buy at UBS AG on “marked improvement” in
financial results and its proposed merger with a smaller rival.  “We believe the bonds do have room to tighten
from here,” analysts Kathleen Middlemiss, Tatiana Boroditskaya
and Emmy Al-Ghabra wrote in a note dated Aug. 10. “We also
forecast continued deleveraging from the group and sustained
cash flow which could also warrant an upgrade from the rating
agencies.”  Aldar said last week second-quarter profit more than
tripled to 418 million dirhams ($114 million) as revenue
increased. The company, which received 36 billion dirhams in
government support in 2011 after the emirate’s property market
slumped, is exploring a merger with  Sorouh Real Estate Co. (SOROUH) 
Talks, supported by Abu Dhabi’s government, may take months, the
companies said in June.  “The merged entity should benefit from improved credit
profile as well as continued support from government,” UBS
said. Aldar’s management at a call reiterated its development
capital expenditure guidance at 5 billion dirhams to 6 billion
dirhams for the next 18-24 months as well as its guidance for
net recurring revenue at 1.1 billion dirhams to 1.2 billion
dirhams by the 2014-2015 financial year, according to the
research note.  The yield on Aldar’s 10.75 percent $1.25 billion bonds
maturing in May 2014 has tightened 63 basis points this year to
5.18 percent on Aug. 10, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The shares  have surged 36 percent in 2012 compared
with a 5.9 percent gain for the benchmark ADX General Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
