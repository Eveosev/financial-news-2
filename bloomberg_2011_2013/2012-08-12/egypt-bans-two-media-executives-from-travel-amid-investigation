Egypt ’s prosecutor-general has
banned the head of a satellite channel and the editor-in-chief
of an independent newspaper from travel amid allegations of
incitement to kill the president and fueling sectarian strife,
the state-run Middle East  News Agency  reported.  The decisions are the latest targeting Tawfiq Okasha, the
head of the Al-Faraeen channel and Islam Afifi, the editor-in-
chief of Al-Dostour, MENA said today. Okasha was under
investigation by state security prosecutors for allegedly
seeking to incite violence against President Mohamed Mursi.
Okasha said Aug. 9 that the move to suspend his channel and the
investigation was an “expected decision given the battle”
between him and the Muslim Brotherhood.  Complaints filed against Al-Dostour, which has been sharply
critical of the Brotherhood, include insulting the president and
inciting sectarian strife. The claims are linked to recent
Muslim-Christian clashes in the village of Dahshour, near Giza.
The newspaper’s issues were confiscated yesterday following a
court ruling, Ahram Online reported.  The Brotherhood and its political arm, the Freedom and
Justice Party, have repeatedly complained about what they say is
bias in the media aimed at undercutting Mursi. The president was
nominated for the office by the Brotherhood.  To contact the reporter on this story:
