Saudi Arabia ’s  inflation rate  fell
to its lowest in almost three years as increases in the costs of
food eased.  Inflation slowed to 4 percent in July, compared with 4.9
percent in the previous month, the Central Department of
Statistics said on its website today. Food prices increased 4
percent, down from 4.7 percent in June.  The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency said in a report on its
website today that inflationary pressures in the kingdom, the
Arab world’s largest economy, are expected to stabilize in the
third quarter as global increases in food costs slow and
inflation in other countries eases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
