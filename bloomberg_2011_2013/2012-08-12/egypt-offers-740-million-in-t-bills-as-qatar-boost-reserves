Egypt  will offer 4.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($740 million) of treasury bills today after
securing $2 billion from Qatar to help boost reserves that fell
to a record low in July.  The North African country will sell three- and nine-month
securities valued at 1 billion pounds and 3.5 billion pounds,
respectively, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The
average yield on  nine-month notes  rose for the first time in six
auctions last week, gaining six basis points, or 0.06 of a
percentage point, to 15.71 percent. The  three-month yield  was
little changed at 14.19 percent.  Qatar, the world’s richest country based on per-capita
income, agreed to deposit the funds with the central bank,
Egyptian Presidential spokesman Yasser Ali said yesterday.
Foreign reserves tumbled by $1.1 billion last month to $14.4
billion, the lowest level since Bloomberg started tracking them
in 2004.  Today’s sales are part of a Finance Ministry plan to raise
a record 175 billion pounds in the three months that end Sept.
30.  The yield on the nation’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 advanced two basis points to 6.21 percent on Aug. 10.
That’s still near the lowest level since November. The pound was
little changed at 6.0841 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
