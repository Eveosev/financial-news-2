Chinese stocks  traded in New York
posted the biggest weekly increase in 2012 on speculation policy
makers will take further measures to stimulate the economy after
inflation fell to a two-year low and export growth slowed.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. climbed 5.2 percent to 91.93 last
week, the steepest gain since the five days ended Dec. 2.  51job
Inc. (JOBS) , an online recruiting services provider, and  China Lodging
Group Ltd. (HTHT)  surged more than 20 percent on better-than-estimated
profits. Sina Corp., a social-media company, completed the
biggest climb since March.  Government data showed last week that exports grew 1
percent after climbing 11.3 percent in June, missing the 8
percent median estimate of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Consumer prices rose 1.8 percent last month, the slowest pace
since January 2010. Policy makers cut  interest rates  in June and
July after two reductions in banks’ reserve-requirement ratios
this year as the economy expanded at the slowest pace since
2009. China also stepped up approval of investment projects.  “The worse China’s economic data is, the more likely the
equity market is going to perform well just because it will add
more and more of a case for stimulus,”  Dave Lutz , head of
exchange-traded fund trading at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said in a
phone interview on Aug. 10 from Baltimore. “A lot of people are
anticipating aggressive stimulus policy out of China.”  China ETF Advances  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
ETF in the U.S., added 1.2 percent to $35.23 in the five days to
Aug. 10, completing its third week of gains. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (CH55BN)  of the biggest U.S. shares increased 1.1
percent to 1,405.87, up for a fifth week.  51job, based in  Shanghai , surged 20 percent to $43.84 on
Aug. 10 in New York, completing a weekly rally of 26 percent.  The online recruiter said on Aug. 9 that second-quarter
adjusted net income was 66 cents per American depositary share
and reported sales $56.7 million in sales, beating the company’s
previous guidance. The company forecast third-quarter profit of
as much as 66 cents per share, beating the 64 cents estimate by
William Blair & Co.  “Expectations about the second quarter were so low that
investors were pleased that the company’s reassuring outlook
suggests their market is stable and hasn’t deteriorated,” Jeff
Papp, a senior analyst at Oberweis Asset Management Inc., which
manages $700 million and holds shares in 51job, said by phone
from Lisle,  Illinois  on Aug. 10. “51job’s competitive position
continues to improve as they’re probably gaining some market
share in the downturn.”  China Lodging Forecast  Shanghai-based China Lodging raised its estimate for 2012
sales growth to as much as 41 percent in an Aug. 9 statement,
from the previous 37.5 percent. Adjusted net income for the
second quarter jumped 69 percent from a year earlier to 75
million  yuan  ($11.8 million).  Home Inns & Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN) , which runs the biggest
economy hotel chain in China, advanced 11 percent in the last
five days to $22.13, its third weekly gain.  7 Days Group
Holdings Ltd. (SVN) , the second largest, retreated 3.9 percent during
the week to $9.62 after surging 21 percent in the previous
period.  Home Inns’ net income of $5.7 million for the second
quarter compared with the $12.4 million average estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 7 Days’ $8.7 million profit for
the three months trailed the $10 million mean estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  ‘No Rebound’  “There’s clearly no rebound noted,” Ella Ji, a hotel
chains analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said in an e-mailed report
on Aug. 10.  Separate government reports showed last week  China ’s
industrial output growth unexpectedly slowed in July to 9.2
percent from a year earlier and retail sales rose 13.1 percent,
trailing analysts’ forecasts. Barclays Plc cut its estimate for
third-quarter growth to 7.7 percent from 8.2 percent last week
while Deutsche Bank AG lowered its forecast to 7.5 percent from
7.9 percent.  Sina, which runs the Twitter-like Weibo service in China,
rose 17 percent in the past five days to $52.04, the largest
weekly gain in five months.  The Shanghai-based company,  due to report  second-quarter
results on Aug. 15, may report a second-quarter loss of $3.9
million, compared with a profit of $10 million a year earlier,
according to the average estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
