Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  may postpone a summit next month with South Korean
President  Lee Myung Bak  after Lee’s visit to islets claimed by
both countries, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  South Korea and Japan were arranging a meeting between the
two leaders on Sept. 8 at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit in Vladivostok,  Russia , the paper said yesterday, without
citing anyone. The report came after Foreign Minister  Koichiro Gemba  said on Aug. 11 Japan may refer the dispute to the United
Nation’s International Court of Justice.  Lee’s Aug. 10 trip to the islets, known as Dokdo in Korean
and Takeshima in Japanese, exacerbated tensions between  Asia ’s
second and fourth-biggest economies. The two countries are mired
in a dispute over compensating women who served as sex slaves
during  Japan ’s colonial occupation of Korea, which led to the
last minute postponement of a defense pact in June.  “We have to get the international community to clearly
understand our claims,” Gemba told reporters, according to a
transcript on the Foreign Ministry’s website. “In order to
achieve a peaceful resolution to this, we are considering
measures that include appealing to the ICJ.”  In an indication of the friction the dispute has caused, a
South Korean soccer player at the London Olympics held up a sign
saying “Dokdo is our territory” in Korean after his team
defeated Japan 2-0 on Aug. 10 to win the bronze medal. He was
banned from the medal ceremony as a result  Any appeal to the international  court  may have a limited
impact because both parties have to recognize its jurisdiction
in the matter, something  South Korea  has declined to do. Japan
has twice brought the issue before the UN body to no avail.  Envoy Recalled  Lee’s visit to the rocky islets, the first by a South
Korean president, prompted Japan to recall its ambassador to
 Seoul  and call in South Korea’s envoy to Tokyo to protest. South
Korea has bolstered its claims by stationing coast guard
personnel there year-round and by building an offshore research
center nearby.  Noda called Lee’s trip “unacceptable” at an Aug. 10
nationally televised press conference.  “I have made efforts with South Korea’s President Lee to
build a forward-looking relationship and in that context this is
extremely regrettable,” he said.  The rocks lie 87 kilometers (54 miles) east from the
closest South Korean territory, Ulleung Island, and 158
kilometers from the nearest Japanese land. The area includes
fishing grounds and natural gas reserves and may also have oil,
according to a South Korean government  website .  Construction Plans  South  Korea  last year said it will spend 400 billion won
($354 million) to build a breakwater, a power plant, an
underwater observatory and a tunnel on the islets beginning in
2013. The dispute almost provoked a clash in April 2006, when
South Korean gunboats went on alert to block a planned Japanese
Coast Guard survey.  Lee’s government on June 29 postponed an agreement with
Japan to share military intelligence hours before it was to be
signed because of domestic opposition.  His visit to the disputed area was aimed at improving his
standing and that of New Frontier Party ahead of presidential
elections in December, said Kuni Miyake, research director at
the Canon Institute for Global Studies in  Tokyo . Lee, who can’t
run for re-election, has seen his approval rating drop by more
than 50 percent since taking office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
