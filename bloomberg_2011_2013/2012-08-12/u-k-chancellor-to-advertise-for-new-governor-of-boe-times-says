Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is to advertise for a new governor of the Bank of
England after several candidates dropped out of the race because
of the Libor-rigging scandal, according to the Sunday Times.  Remaining candidates have been told that the post will be
advertised in the fall in a number of publications and that they
should register an official interest then, the newspaper said,
citing an unidentified candidate. Mervyn Kingâ€™s term as governor
expires in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
