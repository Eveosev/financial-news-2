Apple Inc. is considering funding a
prize for women’s fiction in the U.K. after mobile-phone
operator Orange withdrew its sponsorship in May, according to
the Sunday Telegraph.  The Cupertino, California-based company has had the “most
advanced” talks of a number of potential sponsors with award
organizers, the London newspaper said, citing people it didn’t
identify. The sponsorship would probably result in a “marketing
arrangement” involving Apple’s electronic books store,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
