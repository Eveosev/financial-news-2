Dubai shares lost the most in almost
a week before the start of the Muslim Eid holidays next week and
after oil fell following a slowdown in China’s export growth.  Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI) , the  Middle East ’s biggest discount
airline, slumped the most since April 18 after rallying 3.3
percent last week.  Aramex PJSC (ARMX) , which competes in the Middle
East with Deutsche Post’s DHL and  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) ,
fell the most since June. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  slipped 0.3
percent, the biggest drop since Aug. 6, to 1,568.38 at the close
in Dubai. The index advanced 1.4 percent last week.  Egypt’s
 EGX30 Index (EGX30)  rose 0.2 percent.  The drop in Dubai’s market is “an interim technical
correction before the Eid holiday,” said Nabil Farhat, a
partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “The market
will most likely see a pick-up after Ramadan ends, if not
earlier.”  The Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from
sunrise to sunset and business activity slows, began July 20.
About 68 million shares  traded  in Dubai today, compared with a
twelve-month daily average of 139 million.  Persian Gulf states 
will celebrate the Eid holiday, which marks the end of Ramadan,
next week, with  Saudi Arabia (SABIC) ’s market closing for business from
Aug. 18 through Aug. 22.  Oil Outlook  Oil for September delivery slipped 0.5 percent to $92.87 a
barrel on Aug. 10 in New York after the  International Energy
Agency  cut demand forecasts. China’s customs bureau reported
outbound shipments increased 1 percent in July from a year
earlier, after an 11 percent rise in June. It was the worst
export growth since 2009. Gulf Arab oil exporters, including
Qatar and the U.A.E., supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Air Arabia fell 3 percent to 64 fils. The company last week
reported a 31 percent increase in second-quarter profit. Aramex
decreased 2.2 percent, the most since June 21, to 1.79 dirhams.  Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.1 percent,
while the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of Persian Gulf stocks and
Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  were little changed. Kuwait’s
 measure  lost 0.4 percent and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  fell 0.1 percent.
 Abu Dhabi ’s  gauge  and Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  rose 0.2 percent.  Renaissance Services SAOG (RNSS)  gained the most since May 22,
advancing 1.8 percent to 0.451 rial, after the Omani provider of
services to the oil and gas industry said its Topaz Energy and
Marine Ltd. unit won two long-term charters valued at more than
$65 million.  Israel’s benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  declined 0.6 percent. The
yield on the 5.5 percent benchmark Mimshal Shiklit government
bonds due January 2022 rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
