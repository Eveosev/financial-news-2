BillionaireGeorge Soros, who turns
82 today, plans to marry Tamiko Bolton next year in Southampton,
New York.  Soros announced his engagement to family and friends
gathered at his house in Southampton on Long Island yesterday to
celebrate his birthday, according to a person who attended and
asked not to be named because the party was private.  The couple met in 2008 at a luncheon in New York, the
person said. Soros proposed to Bolton, 40, on a recent weekend.
 Michael Vachon , a spokesman for Soros, declined to comment.  Bolton is a health-care and and education consultant who
most recently developed a Web-based yoga-education platform, the
person said. She graduated from the University of Utah and has
an MBA from the  University of Miami . It will be her second
marriage and Soros’s third.  Soros is chairman of New York-based Soros Fund Management
LLC, his former hedge fund that became a family office last
year. The office oversees $25 billion for Soros, his family and
foundations.  The Hungarian emigre, who ranks 21st on the  Bloomberg
Billionaires Index , stepped back from day-to-day  money
management  in 1989 to spend more time on philanthropic work. In
the past three decades, he’s given away more than $8 billion to
promote democracy, foster free speech, improve education and
fight poverty around the world, according to his Bloomberg
Billionaires biography. He has five children from his previous
marriages.  The couple told their friends the wedding will take place
next summer, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
