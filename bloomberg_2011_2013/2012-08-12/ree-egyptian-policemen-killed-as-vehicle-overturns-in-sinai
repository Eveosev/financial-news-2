Three Egyptian policemen were killed
when their vehicle overturned as they chased a group of
criminals in Sinai, the state-run Ahram Gate reported today.  Four others were injured in the accident late yesterday.
Security forces launched an offensive in the northern part of
Sinai after 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by unidentified
militants on Aug. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
