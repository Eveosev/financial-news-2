The chairman of the London Metal
Exchange said the market won’t be open to manipulation by China
after the bourse’s sale to  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (388)  Ltd.,
according to the Sunday Telegraph.  “If it ceased to be trusted, why wouldn’t the metal
traders go somewhere else?” Brian Bender was quoted in the
London newspaper. “In which case, the buyer would have wasted a
lot of money on something that wasn’t worth a lot.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
