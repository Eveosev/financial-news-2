A 1930s  Mercedes (DAI)  may sell for more
than $16 million in  California  this month as classic-car
auctioneers test the market with an unprecedented lineup of big-
ticket autos by names such as Ferrari, Bugatti and Bentley.  The Mercedes-Benz 540 K Special Roadster is one of only 30
built. It may exceed an auction record of $16.4 million, set by
a Ferrari last year, and comfortably beat the price of a Ferrari
250 GT California Spyder convertible, one of three included in
the series of sales, which is estimated at $9 million.  “I’ve never seen so many expensive cars come up for
auction at one time,”  Tom Hartley Jnr ., a Derbyshire. U.K.-
based classic auto dealer said in an interview. “A lot of the
major collectors of the last 30 years are getting old and other
owners have seen prices rise and want to cash in. What happens
this month is going to say a lot about the market.”  The summer sales held by  Gooding & Co ., RM Auctions and
Bonhams on the U.S. west coast are bellwether events for the
market. The Historic Automobile Group International ( HAGI ) Top
50 benchmark Index of exceptional classic cars has gained 8.2
percent in the year through July. If this continues, it will be
up about 14.4 percent over 2012.  “Dealers across the board are saying that it is currently
very difficult to get hold of quality cars,” said Dietrich Hatlapa, founder of HAGI, a London-based research company.
“Owners are happy with what they have and would only sell if
they find something else to buy with the money.”  Record Challenge  Gooding’s sale of 122 cars at Pebble Beach on Aug. 18-19 is
headed by the 1936 Mercedes with “high-door, long-tail”
styling. Another example of this rare model fetched $9.7 million
for RM in Monterey last year. At Gooding last year, a 1957
Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa set a record for any auto at auction.  Gooding has valued a 1935 Duesenberg Model JN Convertible
Coupe formerly owned by the Hollywood star  Clark Gable  at more
than $9 million, while a 1931 Bentley 4.5-liter “Blower” Boat
Tail is estimated at $8 million to $10 million.  On June 29, Bonhams sold a 1929 4.5-liter supercharged
“Blower” Bentley in Sussex, southern  England , for 5 million
pounds ($7.8 million), a record for any British model at
auction.  “There aren’t the speculators around as there were in the
1980s,” the Connecticut-based dealer  Thomas Hamann  said.
“Today’s buyers are looking for a sound investment. Ferraris
from the 1950s and 1960s have seen the strongest rises. High
prices are being paid for prewar Bentleys. Less exceptional cars
from that period might not see as much interest.”  California Spyder  The Ferrari 250 GT California Spyders include a 1960
example at Gooding. It is one of only nine alloy-bodied long
wheelbase versions made and was owned by the late New England
collector  Sherman M. Wolf  since 1979.  “This will attract a lot of interest and could make $10
million,” said Hamann, who specializes in classic Ferraris.  RM will offer a 1962 short wheelbase California Spyder at
its Monterey auction of 120 automobiles on Aug. 17-18. Shown at
the 1990  Pebble Beach  Concours d’Elegance, this restored V-12
convertible carries an estimate of $7.5 million to $9 million.
Ferrari made about 100 California Spyders from 1958 to 1963.  A 1997 GTC Gulf Team Davidoff  McLaren  F1 GTR racer is the
most valuable lot in the Bonhams auction at Quail Lodge, Carmel,
on Aug. 16-17. Driven by works team members during the 1997 FIA
GT championship at circuits such as the Nurburgring and Spa-
Francorchamps, this “Longtail” version of a design that won
the Le Mans 24-hour race has been entered by a private collector
and estimated at about $5 million.  Magnate’s GT40  Bonhams is also offering a restored 1966 Ford GT40 racer
that was formerly owned by the Bolivian tin magnate Jaime Ortiz-
Patino and driven by his godson, Dominique Martin, at Monza and
Hockenheim races in 1969. Subsequently damaged by fire, it is
valued at $2 million to $3 million.  A better-preserved Gulf/Mirage team GT40 raced by Jacky
Ickx in 1968 and used as the camera car in Steve McQueen’s 1971
film “ Le Mans ” may fetch more than $8 million at RM.  None of the three auction houses was prepared to give
presale estimates for their sale totals. Last year, the events
raised $166.7 million, up from $150.2 million in 2010.  Two historic Ferrari Le Mans racers sold for $35 million
and $25 million in private transactions in May, according to
 anamera.com , a website for dealers.  “I expect prices for the most important cars to keep
rising, though the gap could grow between the best and the
rest,” Hartley said. “We’re seeing two types of buyer now.
Half of them want to show and race their cars, the other just
want to invest. Some clients have recently been telling me to
keep the cars for them until they’re ready to sell.”  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
