G4S Plc (GFS) , the security company that
failed to provide enough security staff for the London Olympics,
won an extension of its contract to protect the U.K.’s embassy
in Afghanistan, the Sunday Times reported.  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office awarded a two-year
extension to G4S’s contract to guard the embassy in Kabul, the
London-based newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information. The deal is valued at 72 million pounds ($113
million), according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
