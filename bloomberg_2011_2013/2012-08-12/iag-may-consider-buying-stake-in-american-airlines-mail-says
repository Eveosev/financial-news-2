International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA (IAG) , owner of British Airways, may consider buying a stake
in  American Airlines  Inc., the  Daily Mail  reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer William Walsh.  The move is to prevent American Airlines from being taken
over by  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) , according to the newspaper. It
would be a “small investment,” Walsh was citing as saying by
