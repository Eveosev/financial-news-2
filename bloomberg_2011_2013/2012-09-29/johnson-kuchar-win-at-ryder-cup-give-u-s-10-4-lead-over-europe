Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar beat
Scotland’s Paul Lawrie and Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium at the
Ryder Cup, golf’s premier team competition.  The American pair took the lead when Johnson scored birdie
on the 17th hole at Medinah Country Club outside  Chicago .  The U.S. leads Europe by 10 points to four and needs 14 1/2
points to reclaim the cup, while Europe needs 14 points to
retain it. The event concludes with 12 singles matches tomorrow.  The Americans took an 8-4 lead by winning three of this
morning’s four foursomes matches.  In other fourball matches, Bubba Watson and  Webb Simpson 
beat Justin Rose of  England  and Italy’s Francesco Molinari 5-
and-4, meaning they led by five holes with four to play.  Spain’s Sergio Garcia and Luke Donald of England are two up
on Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker after 15 holes; and Rory
McIlroy from Northern Ireland and Ian Poulter of England are
tied with Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson after 15 holes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
