Host Sri Lanka beat West Indies by
nine wickets to move closer to the semifinals of cricket’s World
Twenty20 tournament, as England stayed in contention to defend
its title.  Mahela Jayawardene  was 65 not out as Sri Lanka reached its
victory total of 130 with 28 balls to spare in the Group 1 Super
Eight game in Pallekele. He shared an unbeaten 108-run stand for
the second wicket with Kumar Sangakkara, who was 39 not out,
after  Tillakaratne Dilshan  was dismissed for 13.  Ajantha Mendis took 2-12 in four overs as Sri Lanka limited
West Indies to 129-5 in its 20 overs. Marlon Samuels scored 50
runs for West Indies, which won the toss and elected to bat, and
Dwayne Bravo had 40.  Sri Lanka leads Group 1 with four points, two more than
England and West Indies, with one game remaining.  New Zealand 
has lost both of its Super Eight matches.  In the day’s opening game, England beat New Zealand by six
wickets for its first win of the stage.  Luke Wright scored 76 runs as the defending champion
reached its target of 149 with seven balls remaining.  Steve Finn 
took 3-16 as England limited New Zealand to 148-6 in its 20
overs.  The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
championship of the game’s shortest form. The Super Eight
consists of two groups of four, with the top two teams in each
advancing to the semifinals.  In tomorrow’s Group 2 games, Australia meets South Africa
and Pakistan plays India. Australia and Pakistan top the group
after winning their opening matches yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
