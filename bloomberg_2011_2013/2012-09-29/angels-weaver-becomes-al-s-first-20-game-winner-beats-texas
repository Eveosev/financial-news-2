Jered Weaver became the American
League’s first 20-game winner after leading the Los Angeles
Angels to a 7-4 victory over the  Texas  Rangers as the Major
League Baseball regular season enters its final five days.  Weaver (20-4) gave up two runs and five hits in seven
innings last night to beat Texas for the fourth straight time
this season. He is the Angels’ first 20-game winner since
Bartolo Colon had 21 in 2005.  “We’re not in a pennant race without him,” Angels manager
Mike Scioscia told reporters. “You look at just what he’s done
virtually every start. I don’t think there’s a more consistent
pitcher in our league.”  The Angels (87-70) are two games behind the Oakland
Athletics (89-68) in the race for an American League wild-card
berth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
