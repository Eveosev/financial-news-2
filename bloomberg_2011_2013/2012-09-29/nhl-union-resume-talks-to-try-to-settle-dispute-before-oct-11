The National Hockey League and the
players’ union return to the bargaining table today to try to
settle disputes over a contract before the regular season is
scheduled to open Oct. 11.  NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said today’s meeting will
focus on economic issues that aren’t related to the distribution
of revenue-sharing funds.  The NHL and National Hockey League Players’ Association met
for six hours yesterday to discuss health and player-safety
issues, including drug testing, according to the league’s
website.  The league locked out players after their collective
bargaining agreement expired on Sept. 15 and then canceled the
preseason when discussions didn’t produce a new collective
bargaining agreement.  The two sides are at odds over revenue sharing and player
compensation. The NHL made a record $3.2 billion in revenue last
season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
