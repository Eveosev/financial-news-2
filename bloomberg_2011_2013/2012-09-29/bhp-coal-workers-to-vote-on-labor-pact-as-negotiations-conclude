BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest exporter of coal used in steelmaking, said workers at
its mines in the Australian state of Queensland will vote on a
labor pact next month after talks with unions concluded.  “It is expected that the process of communicating the
outcomes to employees and the conducting of a ballot will be
completed by the end of October,” Antonios Papaspiropoulos, a
spokesman with BHP in Melbourne, said in an e-mailed statement
today. “This follows the conclusion of negotiations and
mediation by the parties.”  The BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance, known as BMA, and
worker unions agreed in July on a framework to help guide the
completion of an enterprise pact. About 3,000 miners at seven
operations in Queensland stopped work for a week in March and
have held further strikes since industrial action started in
June last year.  The BMA joint venture supplies about 18 percent of global
coking coal exports, according to a March 22 report by Goldman
Sachs Australia Pty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
