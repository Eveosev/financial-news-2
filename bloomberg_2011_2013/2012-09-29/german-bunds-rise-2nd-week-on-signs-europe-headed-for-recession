German bunds rose for a second week
as signs the euro area is headed for a recession boosted demand
for safer assets and fueled speculation the European Central
Bank will keep interest rates at a record low.  The securities gained for a sixth quarter, the longest run
since December 1998, as reports showed  economic confidence  in
the euro area and business sentiment in Germany both worsened in
September. Spanish bonds declined even as the government
introduced new austerity measures. French bonds advanced as
President Francois Hollande raised taxes and cut spending to
reduce the deficit.  “We have expansionary monetary policy so that is
supporting” bunds, said Alessandro Giansanti, an analyst at ING
Groep NV in Amsterdam. “As long as the European Central Bank
does not start first to reduce liquidity from the market and
start to increase rates. As long as that’s not going to happen
you will have a supportive environment for German yields.”  Germany’s  10-year yield  fell 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, this week to 1.44 percent at the 5 p.m. close
in London yesterday. The 1.5 percent bond due September 2022
gained 1.41, or 14.10 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
100.53. The yield dropped 14 basis points this quarter.  An  index  of executive and consumer sentiment in the euro
area dropped to 85 this month from 86.1 in August, the European
Commission said Sept. 27. The Ifo institute in Munich said on
Sept. 24 its business climate index slid to the lowest level
since February 2010.  Austerity Package  Spain’s bonds fell even as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s
nine-month-old government announced its fifth austerity package
on Sept. 27 in an effort to shrink the euro-area’s third-biggest
budget deficit.  Spain’s 10-year yields climbed 18 basis points this week to
5.94 percent, the biggest gain since the period ended Aug. 31.  French government bonds advanced for the first week in more
than a month as Hollande’s first annual budget raised taxes on
the rich and big companies and included a minimum of spending
cuts to reduce the deficit.  The French 10-year yield declined 10 basis points to 2.18
percent after dropping to 2.17 percent yesterday, the least
since Sept. 11.  German bunds returned 1.1 percent in the third quarter
through Sept. 27, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities rose 4.2 percent and Italy’s gained 5.6 percent.  The ECB will meet in Ljubljana, Slovenia, to review
monetary policy on Oct. 4. Spain will sell two-, three- and
five-year notes the same day. France will auction bonds due
between 2018 and 2041, also on Oct. 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
