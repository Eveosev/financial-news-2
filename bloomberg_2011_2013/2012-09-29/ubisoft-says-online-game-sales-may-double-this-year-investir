Ubisoft Entertainment SA’s revenue
from online games will rise by 80 percent to 100 percent in the
current fiscal year, the French weekly  Investir  said, citing
Chief Executive Officer Yves Guillemot.  That increase would bring the proportion of total revenue
from online games to as much as 13 percent and begin adding to
the company’s profits, the weekly said, citing Guillemot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
