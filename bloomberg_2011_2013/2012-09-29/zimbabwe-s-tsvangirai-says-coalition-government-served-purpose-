Zimbabwe  Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai said the country’s coalition government had “served
its purpose” and further political progress is unlikely in a
“unity government.”  Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change has shared
power with President Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front since February 2009. The Southern African
Development Community brokered the power-sharing agreement after
violence marred elections the previous year.  “It’s been a marriage of convenience,” Tsvangirai said
today at his party’s 13th anniversary celebration in Zimbabwe’s
second-largest city of Bulawayo. “Zanu-PF doesn’t like it and
we don’t like it.”  Tsvangirai, 60, didn’t commit himself to an election date,
which Mugabe said this week will be held in March next year. The
MDC said Sept. 28 that Mugabe doesn’t have the authority to set
election dates without political consultation and the approval
of SADC.  MDC, which won the 2008 parliamentary ballot, will contest
elections in 2013, Tsvangirai said without being more specific.  “The MDC has never lost support. Next year we will be
celebrating our 14th anniversary, but we will be celebrating the
anniversary under different circumstances, we will be
celebrating as an MDC government,” he said.  Zanu-PF spokesman  Rugare Gumbo  in Harare didn’t respond to
calls from Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
