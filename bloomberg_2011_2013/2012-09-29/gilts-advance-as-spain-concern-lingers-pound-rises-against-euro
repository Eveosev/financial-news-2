U.K. government bonds rose for a
second week as concern that Spain’s fifth austerity package will
fail to resolve the Iberian nation’s financial crisis boosted
demand for safer assets.  Sterling gained for a second week against the euro as
Spanish protesters called for an end to the fiscal measures
while a general strike in Greece drew as many as 35,000
demonstrators to downtown Athens. Gilts rose even as a report
showed the U.K. economy shrank less than previously estimated in
the second quarter.  “Risk in the  euro zone  remains a primary driver of gilt
yields as investors sought the relative safety of sterling,”
said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at  Credit
Agricole (ACA)  Corporate and Investment Bank in  London . “Data showed
some signs of improvement, but it seems the market is not yet
convinced that the economy is about to turn around.”  The 10-year gilt yield dropped 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, from last week to 1.72 percent at 4:36 p.m.
London time yesterday after falling to 1.68 percent, the lowest
since Sept. 10. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 rose
1.065, or 10.65 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,622) face amount, to
100.30. The yield on 30-year gilts dropped eight basis points to
3.06 percent.  Gilts returned 1.1 percent this quarter through Sept. 27,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. German bunds
gained 1.3 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 0.6 percent.  Spanish Cuts  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government announced
on Sept. 27 a 13 billion-euro ($16.7 billion) package of
spending cuts, and a new tax on lottery winnings in an effort to
shrink the euro-area’s third-largest budget deficit. The Bank of
Spain said last week early indicators suggest gross domestic
product is still falling at a “significant pace” after the
recession deepened in the second quarter.  Sterling posted the biggest quarterly advance against the
dollar since the three months ended March as a report showed
Britain’s services industry expanded at its fastest pace for
more than a year in July, adding to evidence that the economy
has returned to growth. The pound has gained 2.7 percent this
quarter.  The  Bank of England  will keep its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 0.5 percent when policy makers set borrowing costs
on Oct. 4, according to all 50 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg
News . The central bank will stick to its bond-purchase target of
375 billion pounds, a separate survey shows.  The pound is little changed in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The euro fell 0.7 percent and
the dollar slumped 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
