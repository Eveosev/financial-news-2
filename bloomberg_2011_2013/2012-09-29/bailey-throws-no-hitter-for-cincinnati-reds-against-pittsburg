Homer Bailey of the Cincinnati Reds
threw the seventh no-hitter in Major League Baseball this
season, allowing only two baserunners in a 1-0 victory at the
Pittsburgh Pirates.  Bailey, who struck out 10 to tie his career high, got Alex Presley on a pop fly to second base to end the game and become
the first Reds pitcher to throw a no-hitter since Tom Browning
had a perfect game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1988.  The only Pirates to reach base came on an error by third
baseman Scott Rolen in the third inning and a walk to Andrew McCutchen in the seventh.  “I just kept trying to put up zeroes,” Bailey said in a
televised interview. “Just one pitch at a time.”  Bailey, 26, is 13-10 this season for the Reds, who already
have clinched the National League Central division title. It was
the 15th no-hitter in Reds history and the first against the
Pirates since Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals held them
hitless in 1971.  There have been three other no-hitters and three perfect
games in the major leagues this season.  The three perfect games were by Felix Hernandez of the
Seattle Mariners, Matt Cain of the San Francisco Giants and
Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox. The other no-hitters
were by Johan Santana of the  New York  Mets, Jered Weaver of the
Los Angeles Angels and a combined no-hitter by Kevin Millwood
and five Mariners relievers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
