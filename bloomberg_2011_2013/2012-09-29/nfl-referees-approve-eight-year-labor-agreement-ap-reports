The National Football League
decided to pay replacement referees for games they won’t work
this weekend, NFL.com reported.  The NFL’s referees returned to officiate the game between
the Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns on Sept. 27, the day
after the union agreed to an eight-year labor contract that
ended a three-month lockout.  The referees voted 112-5 to approve the collective
bargaining agreement during a meeting yesterday in Irving,  Texas ,
the Associated Press reported.  The league decided to pay wages for today’s games to the
112 replacement officials who worked during the lockout, with
referees receiving $3,500 each and other officials paid $3,000,
NFL.com said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
