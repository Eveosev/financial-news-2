The Yankees lost 3-2 to the Toronto
Blue Jays, giving the Baltimore Orioles a chance to tie New York
for the American League East Division lead with a win against
the Boston Red Sox tonight.  The Yankees are 91-67, a half game ahead of the Orioles
(90-67) atop the five-team standings.  The Yankees led 2-1 after the first at Rogers Centre in
Toronto. New York had run-scoring sacrifice flies from Derek Jeter and Curtis Granderson, and Rajai Davis responded for the
Blue Jays with a home run in the bottom of the inning.  Davis reached on an infield single in the fifth to tie it
and Adeiny Hechavarria batted in Yunel Escobar with a double in
the sixth to win it for Toronto (70-88).  The fourth and final game of the series is tomorrow, with
New York wrapping up the regular season with three home games
against the Red Sox from Oct. 1-3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
