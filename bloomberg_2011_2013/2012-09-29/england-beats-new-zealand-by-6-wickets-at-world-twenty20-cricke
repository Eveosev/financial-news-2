England defeated  New Zealand  by six
wickets in their Super Eight game at cricket’s World Twenty20
championship in Sri Lanka.  Luke Wright scored 76 runs as England reached its victory
target of 149 with seven balls remaining in Pallekele. Earlier,
 Steve Finn  took 3-16 as the defending champion limited New
Zealand to 148-6.  England has two points in Group 1 to tie West Indies and
host Sri Lanka, who play later today. New Zealand has lost both
of its games in the Super Eight stage.  The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
championship of the game’s shortest form. The Super Eight
consists of two groups of four, with the top two teams in each
advancing to the semifinals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
