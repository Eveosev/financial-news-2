Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy and
Ian Poulter of  England  beat U.S. pair Jason Dufner and Zach
Johnson at the Ryder Cup, golf’s premier team competition.  The European pair clinched the victory in the fourball
match by one hole at Medinah Country Club outside  Chicago .  The U.S. leads Europe by 10 points to six and needs 14 1/2
points to reclaim the cup, while Europe requires 14 points to
retain it. The event concludes with 12 singles matches tomorrow.
The biggest comeback in Ryder Cup history was in 1999, when the
U.S. won after entering the final day trailing 10-6.  The Americans took an 8-4 lead by winning three of this
morning’s four foursomes matches.  Bubba Watson and  Webb Simpson  beat Justin Rose of England
and Italy’s Francesco Molinari 5-and-4 for the first point of
the afternoon session.  Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar then defeated Scotland’s
Paul Lawrie and Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium by one hole before
Spain’s Sergio Garcia and Luke Donald of England beat Tiger
Woods and Steve Stricker by the same margin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
