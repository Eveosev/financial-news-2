 South Africa  routed Australia 31-8 in the southern hemisphere’s
Rugby Championship.  Zane Kirchner and Francois Louw also touched down as the
Springboks outscored the Wallabies five tries to one in
Pretoria. The wins ends South Africa’s record run of five losses
to Australia and moves it into second place in the standings
with one game remaining.  World champion New Zealand can clinch the southern
hemisphere championship by winning in Argentina tonight. The All
Blacks lead the standings with 16 points, South Africa has 12,
Australia has eight and winless Argentina has three.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
