Hungary  will probably seek an opt-
out from the single European Union banking supervisory, which
the bloc is working on setting up, as non-euro members would
probably have a “subservient” role, said Karoly Szasz, head of
Hungary’s financial regulator.  In case of an opt-out, Hungary will need to strengthen its
financial regulatory framework and may need to consider a merger
of the central bank and the financial regulator, Szasz told a
conference in Eger today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
