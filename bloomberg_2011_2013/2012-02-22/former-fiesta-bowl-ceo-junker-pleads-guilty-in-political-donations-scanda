Former Fiesta Bowl Chief Executive
Officer John Junker faces as much as 2 1/2 years in prison after
pleading guilty to a state felony charge for his part in
soliciting political donations from employees.  Junker will be sentenced April 26 after entering his plea
yesterday in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix. As part
of the deal, Junker won’t face any more charges after he pleads
guilty to a federal felony count, the  Associated Press  said,
citing his attorney, Stephen Dichter.  The Fiesta Bowl was fined $1 million in May after an
investigation into campaign contributions and executive
compensation. The Arizona Republic reported in December 2009
that current and former bowl employees said they were encouraged
to make contributions to certain politicians and then were
reimbursed.  “To ensure that violations of the law will not occur
again, we have made significant and lasting changes to our
governance and hired some great new leaders who are eager to put
this sad episode behind us,” Fiesta Bowl Chairman Duane Woods
said on the organization’s website.  Junker was fired in March after failing to cooperate with
an independent investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
