AccessKenya Group Ltd. (ACCESS) , the East
African nation’s only publicly traded Internet company, fell for
a fifth day and reached a record low.  The stock declined 6.3 percent to 3.70 shillings by the
close in Nairobi, the capital.  The closing price is its biggest slide since Nov. 29 and
the lowest level since the shares first began trading on the
Nairobi Securities Exchange in June 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors are concerned that the company does not have
the right strategy in view of the rising competition,” Eric
Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd., said by phone today. “They are concerned about the
long term outlook.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
