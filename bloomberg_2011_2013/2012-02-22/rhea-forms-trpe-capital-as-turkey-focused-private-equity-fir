Rhea Asset Management, an investment
trust, has spun off a team to form TRPE Capital, a new private
equity firm focusing on investments in companies in the Turkish
technology, healthcare and business sectors.  The new firm was formed by the former private equity team
at Rhea and will continue to manage its current portfolio of
Rhea investments while making “new commitments from a new
generation of funds under the Turkish Innovation and Growth Fund
family,” a statement from the company said today.  The TRPE Capital team will be managed by Managing Partner
Memet Yazici, currently director of  Rhea Girisim AS. (RHEAG)   Rhea Asset Management Chairman Onur Takmak says his company
will be a minority shareholder in the new firm, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
