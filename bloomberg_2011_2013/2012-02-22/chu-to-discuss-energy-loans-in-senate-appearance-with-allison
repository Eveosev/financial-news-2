Energy Secretary Steven Chu will
appear before a U.S. Senate committee next month to discuss an
Obama administration-ordered analysis of his agency’s clean-
energy loan program, which gave money to failed Solyndra LLC.  Chu will be joined at the March 13 Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee hearing by former Treasury
Department official  Herbert Allison , who wrote the report,
according to a panel statement today. Allison’s Feb. 10 report
said long-term losses on 30 U.S. clean-energy loans and loan
guarantees might be about $2.7 billion, or $200 million less
than the department’s estimate.  The Energy Department should also take additional steps to
reduce the chances of default, such as creating the position of
chief risk officer to review the loan programs, according to
Allison’s analysis.  The White House ordered the report and hired Allison after
Republicans criticized the loan program following the collapse
of Solyndra, a solar-panel maker that filed for  bankruptcy
protection  in September, two years after winning a $535 million
U.S. loan guarantee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
