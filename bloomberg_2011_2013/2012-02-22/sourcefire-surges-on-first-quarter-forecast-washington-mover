Sourcefire (FIRE)  Inc., a network-security
company, rose as much as 16 percent in pre-market trading after
demand for protection against cybercrime drove the company’s
first-quarter revenue forecast above analysts’ estimates.  The Columbia, Maryland-based company predicted revenue of
$40 million to $42 million, according to a statement released
yesterday after the close of regular trading. That topped the
 $38.4 million average estimate  of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sourcefire also reported adjusted earnings of 25
cents a share for the 2011 fourth quarter, beating the  average
estimate  of 19 cents.  “With our strong position and all the press given to the
threats targeted at the federal government, it’s clear to us
that our solutions are a funding priority,” Sourefire Chief
Executive Officer John Burris said on a conference call
yesterday.  Sourefire rose to $40.80 in pre-market trading at 8:28 a.m.
in  New York  and had climbed as high as $41.50, compared with the
close of $35.82 yesterday. The shares advanced 45 percent in the
12 months before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
