U.S. gasoline demand rose 3.4
percent last week to 8.28 million barrels a day from a record
low,  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  said.  The gain was the first in three weeks, according to
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report. The previous week’s
consumption was 8.01 million, the lowest level in MasterCard
data that began in July 2004.  Demand was 6.4 percent below the same week in 2011. It was
the fifth week in a row that consumption dropped more than 5
percent from the year-earlier level.  The average pump price rose 3 cents from the previous week
to $3.53 a gallon, up 12 percent in the past year.  “These declines in gasoline demand have been growing
larger in tandem with the steady rise in gasoline prices,” John Gamel, a gasoline analyst and director of economic analysis for
SpendingPulse, said in the report.  Gasoline use over the previous four weeks was 5.7 percent
below the 2011 period, the 48th consecutive decline in that
measure.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
