The European Commission said it
opened an in-depth antitrust investigation in the air-transport
industry in Germany and  Austria .  The commission, the European Union’s antitrust regulator in
Brussels, said it will investigate whether financial
arrangements between public authorities and the airports of
Saarbrücken, Zweibrücken and Lübeck-Blankensee in Germany and
Klagenfurt in Austria, as well as rebates and marketing
agreements concluded between these airports and some of the
airlines using them, are in line with EU state-aid rules.  The opening of proceedings does not prejudge the outcome of
the investigation, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
