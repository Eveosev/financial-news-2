HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA , a
Rio de Janeiro-based oil explorer, rose the most in almost five
months after partner  Energulf Resources Inc. (ENG)  released oil
reserve estimates for an area off the coast of Namibia.  HRT, which operates 10 exploration licenses in Namibia and
has minority stakes in another two areas, jumped 7.9 percent to
612.5 reais in  Sao Paulo  at 2:36 p.m. Earlier the stock rose as
much as 11 percent, the steepest intraday gain since Oct. 6.  Energulf released a report yesterday stating that it has
3.2 billion barrels of recoverable oil at block 1711 in Namibia.
The report was prepared by Netherland Sewell and Associates
Inc., an oil reservoir engineering firm. HRT has a minority
stake in the block.  Namibia holds an estimated 11 billion barrels of
recoverable oil in reservoirs similar to those found off the
coast of  Brazil , according to HRTâ€™s website. The company has
said it will begin exploration drilling in the second half of
this year in Namibia, where it has more areas than any other
competitor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
