OAO Aeroflot (AFLT)  and  Alitalia SpA (AZA)  will
lose their monopoly on flights between Russia and  Italy  after
the countries agreed to allow in two more carriers,  Vedomosti 
reported, citing a Russian transport ministry official.  The number of flights from Moscow to  Rome  and Milan is
expected to increase 60 percent to 56 a week after the new
carriers, one from each country, join the routes, the newspaper
said. Authorities have not yet decided which new airlines will
serve the routes, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
