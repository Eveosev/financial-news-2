Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  business-jet
deliveries climbed 21 percent last year, outperforming a global
industry in which total shipments declined, a U.S. trade group
said.  Bombardier’s accompanying 20 percent gain in billings
helped fuel an increase of less than 1 percent across
manufacturers for all light aircraft, including piston-engine
and turboprop planes, the General Aviation Manufacturers
Association  said  today.  Industry billings climbed 0.4 percent to $19.1 billion, the
Washington-based group said. Billings at Montreal-based
Bombardier, the world’s largest maker of business jets by sales,
rose to $5.9 billion in 2011 from $4.9 billion a year earlier.  While total light airplane shipments dropped for a third
consecutive year, dipping 3.5 percent, “a majority of market
fundamentals are moving in the right direction,” Caroline
Daniels, chairman of the industry group, said in a statement.
Planemakers delivered 1,865 aircraft globally in 2011, down from
1,932 in  2010 , the group said.  Declines of 1.5 percent for shipments of piston-engine
planes, 2.4 percent for turboprops and 6.3 percent for  business
jets  “indicate general aviation is reaching the trough in this
cycle,” Daniels said.  Corporate Profits  Business-jet sales typically lag growth in corporate
earnings, which reached a record $1.97 trillion in the third
quarter of 2011, according to the most recent data from the
Commerce Department. That’s up 1.7 percent from the previous
three months and 7.5 percent higher than the same period in
2010.  Bombardier tapped growing demand for its Learjet,
Challenger 605 and Global 5000 models to deliver 182 business
jets in 2011, up from 150 a year earlier, trade group data show.  “Investors may become somewhat more optimistic about 2012
business jet delivery forecasts for Bombardier” after seeing
the 2011 data, Michael Willemse, an analyst at  CIBC World
Markets  in Toronto, said today in a note to clients. Bombardier
may deliver about 160 to 170 business jets this year, said
Willemse, who rates the stock “sector outperform.”  Bombardier’s Class B  stock  rose 1.3 percent to C$4.73 at 4
p.m. in Toronto. The shares have climbed 17 percent this year.  Gulfstream Billings Rise  With billings of $4.9 billion,  General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD) 
Gulfstream aerospace unit ranked second after Bombardier among
aircraft makers tracked by the association. That’s a 23 percent
increase from 2010 billings of $4 billion.  France ’s  Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  followed with billings of
$2.7 billion, a 31 percent drop from a year earlier.  About half of business-jet deliveries last year took place
in the U.S., the association said.  Europe  accounted for about 20
percent of shipments, compared with 14 percent for the Asia
Pacific region and about 10 percent for  Latin America . Asia
Pacific’s share of global shipments has tripled in the past five
years, the association said.  Shipments of large-cabin jets, weighing more than 50,000
pounds (22,700 kilograms), were little changed at 200 last year,
the association said. Deliveries of medium-sized jets --weighing
12,500 to 50,000 pounds -- rose 15 percent to 375 units, while
light-jet shipments dropped about 46 percent to 106 units.  Light-jet deliveries have plunged 71 percent since 2008, a
period in which large-jet shipments increased 4 percent, trade
group data show.  “The impact of the economic recession has been felt most
acutely at the lighter end of the business-jet spectrum,”
Daniels said at a news conference in  Washington  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
