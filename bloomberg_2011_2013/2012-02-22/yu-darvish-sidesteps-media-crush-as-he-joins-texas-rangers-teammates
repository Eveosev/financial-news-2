Yu Darvish sidestepped about two
dozen Japanese reporters and photographers as he arrived for his
first day of informal workouts with the  Texas Rangers .  Darvish, 25, arrived at spring training camp yesterday, a
day before the Major League Baseball team’s official reporting
date for pitchers and catchers.  Darvish, who avoided Japanese photographers at the Phoenix
airport by driving from  Los Angeles  to the team’s spring camp in
Surprise, Arizona, mostly ignored media members as he met
teammates for the first time.  The Rangers kept their clubhouse closed and most practice
fields off limits to media members. Darvish is expected to hold
a news conference tomorrow.  Darvish went 93-38 with a 1.99 earned run average in seven
seasons with the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. The Rangers paid
a record $51.7 million fee to the Japanese club for the right to
negotiate with Darvish, and then signed the right-hander to a
six-year contract in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
