Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the world’s biggest maker
of mobile phones, plans to expand its handset lineup to attract
hobby photographers and first-time smartphone users at the World
Mobile Congress in Barcelona next week.  Nokia’s products at the fair will include a camera-focused
phone running its 10-year-old Symbian operating system,
according to two people familiar with the plan, who asked not to
be identified before the unveiling. The Espoo, Finland-based
manufacturer will also present lower-priced, entry-level
smartphones, they said. Susan Sheehan, a Nokia spokeswoman,
declined to comment.  This year is the first since 2009 that Nokia has a booth at
the annual Barcelona show. For the past two years, the company
has held off-site press conferences during the event, including
Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop’s session last year to
explain Nokia’s new strategy and his decision to adopt  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows Phone.  Elop is betting Nokia can sell Windows Phones fast enough
to compensate for the Symbian line it’s phasing out. Nokia’s
Lumia, which started selling in  Europe  and is expanding into
markets such as India and  China  where the smartphone battle is
its early stages, has sold more than 1 million units, Nokia said
in January.  Nokia fell 0.2 percent to 4.21 euros at 4:54 p.m. in
Helsinki.  To contact the reporter on this story:
