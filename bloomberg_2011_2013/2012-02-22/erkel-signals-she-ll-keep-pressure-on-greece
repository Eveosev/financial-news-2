German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
indicated she will maintain pressure on Greece to meet debt-
cutting pledges required for its second financial rescue, saying
fiscal discipline is needed to hold the euro area together.  “If you have a single currency you naturally have to be
able to trust each other,” she told members of her Christian
Democratic Union party in Demmin,  Germany , today. While “it is
right” to bail out Greece,  Portugal  and Ireland, “we have to
say again and again that everyone must do their homework because
otherwise this  Europe  can’t hold together.”  Merkel’s renewed backing for European unity in the face of
the debt crisis marked her first public comments since euro-area
finance ministers signed off yesterday on a 130 billion-euro
($172 billion) rescue for  Greece  aimed at averting the first
sovereign default in the currency union’s 13-year history.  Addressing the crowd at an Ash Wednesday rally in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the eastern state where she has
her electoral district, Merkel said austerity measures imposed
by Greek leaders as conditions for the country’s two bailouts
mean “we are asking a lot” of average Greeks. Greece must turn
into a “properly functioning state,” she said.  Merkel, who has said in recent weeks she wants Greece to
remain in the 17-nation euro area, said Germany is too small
“to stand alone” in Europe.  “But it has to be a Europe in which we all pull in the
same direction, by standing together, by following solid
economic policies, by everyone doing their homework,” she said.
“Then we can promote our interests together.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
