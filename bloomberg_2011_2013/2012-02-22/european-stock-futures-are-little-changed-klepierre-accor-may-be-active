European stocks retreated for a
second day after a report showed services and manufacturing
output in the euro area unexpectedly contracted in February.  Straumann Holding AG (STMN) , the world’s biggest maker of dental
implants, fell the most since November after full-year profit
missed analysts’ estimates.  TUI AG (TUI1) , Europe’s largest travel
company, declined 7.6 percent after Banco CAM SAU sold a 12.9-
million block of shares. PSA Peugeot Citroen, Europe’s second-
largest carmaker, surged 12 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  fell 0.8 percent to 264.59 at
the close. The gauge has still rallied 8.2 percent this year
amid speculation that the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis will
be contained and as U.S. economic data exceeded forecasts.  “Given that Europe is still shrouded by the cloud of
recession, a weak PMI -- though not rain on the parade -- will
surely damp investor sentiment,” said  Manish Singh , the London-
based head of investment at Crossbridge Capital, which has more
than $2 billion under management. “In particular, weak numbers
from  Germany  indicate weak European demand and a weak growth
prospect for the  euro zone  as a whole.”  European (SXXP)  services and manufacturing output unexpectedly
shrank in February as the euro-area economy struggled to rebound
from a contraction in the fourth quarter. A euro-area composite
index based on a survey of purchasing managers in both
industries dropped to 49.7 from 50.4 in January, London-based
Markit Economics said in an initial estimate released by e-mail
today. Economists had forecast a reading of 50.5, according to
the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  German Slowdown  A separate Purchasing Managers Index showed German services
and manufacturing expansion unexpectedly slowed in February amid
declining orders at factories in  Europe ’s largest economy.  The second rescue package for Greece may not be enough to
end the debt crisis, Bank of England Deputy Governor Charlie Bean said in a speech late yesterday in Glasgow,  Scotland .  While the agreement “is certainly welcome, there still
remains a possibility that events could unfold in a disorderly
and damaging fashion at some stage in the future,” Bean said.  Fitch Ratings  cut Greece’s credit grade two levels to ‘C’
from ‘CCC’ after the country got approval to proceed with a bond
exchange that will reduce its debt burden and avert the collapse
of the economy.  Euro-area finance ministers yesterday approved a 130
billion-euro ($172 billion) package for  Greece  by tapping into
European Central Bank profits and convincing investors to
provide more debt relief to the country. The deal includes a
53.5 percent writedown for investors in the nation’s debt.  BOE Minutes  Minutes of the U.K central bank’s February meeting showed
seven of the nine members of the BOE’s Monetary Policy
Committee, including Governor  Mervyn King , voted to increase the
bond-purchase target by 50 billion pounds ($78.6 billion) to 325
billion pounds. They argued that a larger increase “risked
sending a signal that the committee thought the economic
situation was weaker than it was,” the minutes showed.  Straumann dropped 8.4 percent to 145.70 Swiss francs, its
biggest decline since Dec. 30, after it reported full-year
earnings before interest and taxes of 79.9 million francs ($87.6
million). That missed the average analyst estimate of 164.3
million francs. Net income was 71 million francs, compared with
the 75.6 million-franc projection by analysts.  TUI Slides  TUI (TUI1)  retreated 7.6 percent to 5.99 euros.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA is
managing the sale of 12.85 million TUI shares priced at 6.05
euros apiece, according to terms of the offer obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Nexity SA (NXI) , the French real-estate services company, dropped
6.6 percent to 21.86 euros as it forecast a “trough year” in
2012 for the new homes market and a slowdown in commercial real
estate. The company’s full-year net income slumped to 54.2
million euros from 119.8 million euros in 2010.  Temenos Group AG lost 5.7 percent to 16.50 francs after the
banking-software maker’s fourth-quarter revenue of $127 million
missed the average analyst estimate of $139.1 million. The
company was unable to give 2012 forecasts due to its proposed
merger with Misys Plc.  Peugeot surged 12 percent to 16.13 euros, the most since
April 2009. The company, which last week reported a slump in
profit and an increase in debt, is in talks on a possible
alliance with General Motors Co., French Labor Minister Xavier Bertrand said.  Cove Jumps  Cove Energy Plc (COV)  rallied 26 percent to 194 pence, the
highest since at least May 2005, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s biggest oil company,
offered to buy the U.K. explorer for 992.4 million pounds in
cash.  Klepierre SA (LI) ,  France ’s second-largest publicly traded
shopping center owner, rose 1 percent to 23.78 euros after La
Lettre de L’Expansion  reported  that BNP Paribas SA is in talks
to sell its 51 percent stake in the company to  Norway ’s Norges
Bank.  Accor SA (AC) , Europe’s biggest hotel company, advanced 2.5
percent to 26.84 euros after full-year profit rose 19 percent.
Earnings before interest and tax climbed to 530 million euros
from 446 million euros a year earlier. That compared with the
523.7 million-euro average of 17 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg  survey  and Accor’s own forecast of 510 million euros
to 530 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
