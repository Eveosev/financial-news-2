Indian stocks declined from a seven-
month and amid concern the recent rally may have exceeded the
outlook for earnings growth.  State Bank of India Ltd. , the biggest lender, plunged the
most since July 2009, pacing losses among its peers.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) ,
the largest developer, dropped for the first time in six days.
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the biggest copper and zinc
producer, sank 6.5 percent.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, lost 1.5 percent
to 18,143.89, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai, retreating from its highest level since July 26.
Its 14-day relative strength index reached 79 yesterday.
Readings of above 70 are a signal to sell for some investors.  The Sensex has jumped 20 percent from its low in December,
a threshold that signals a  bull market , as a strengthening rupee
and the first reduction in banks’ reserve ratios since 2009
spurred foreigners to buy a net $5 billion of stocks.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India retreated 1.8 percent to 5,505.35.  Foreign  funds  bought a net  121 million  of equities on Feb.
17. They withdrew $512 million in 2011 on concern  Europe ’s
crisis may erode company profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
