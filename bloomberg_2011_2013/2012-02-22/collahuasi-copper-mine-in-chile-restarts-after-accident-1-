Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  Xstrata Plc’s (XTA) 
Collahuasi operation in Chile restarted today after a fatal
accident shut the world’s third-largest copper mine.  Both mining and plant operations were closed yesterday
pending an investigation into the worker’s death at the mine’s
sulfur plant that occurred Feb. 20, spokeswoman Bernardita
Fernandez said in an e-mailed statement today. The investigation
will continue even as mining restarts, she said.  Collahuasi, which produces about 3 percent of the world’s
copper, was disrupted earlier this week by snowstorms caused by
a seasonal weather front at the site 4,400 meters (14,426 feet)
above  sea level .  Output at the mine declined 10 percent last year to 453,409
metric tons after adverse weather, labor stoppages and lower ore
grades affected operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
