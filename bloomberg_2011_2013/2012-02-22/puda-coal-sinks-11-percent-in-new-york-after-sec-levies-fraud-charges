China ’s  Puda Coal Inc. (PUDA)  tumbled 11
percent after the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two
of its executives with defrauding investors.  The company’s shares sank to 25 cents per share in New
York, the lowest level since Feb. 17 based on closing prices.  The SEC charged Puda chairman Ming Zhao and former Chief
Executive Officer Liping Zhu, according to a statement from the
regulatory body today. The executives defrauded investors into
believing they were investing in a Chinese coal business when in
fact they were investing in an empty shell company, the SEC
said.  The Taiyuan, China-based company said in a Jan. 13
statement that director Jianfei Ni resigned from the board. On
Aug. 10, 2011, Puda said it received notification from the  New
York  Stock Exchange that the bourse intended to delist its
common stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
