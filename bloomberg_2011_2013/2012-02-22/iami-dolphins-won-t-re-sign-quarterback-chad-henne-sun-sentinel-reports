The Miami Dolphins won’t make a
contract offer to quarterback Chad Henne when he becomes a free
agent on March 13, the  Florida Sun-Sentinel reports , citing
unidentified National Football League sources.  Henne, 26, was a second-round draft pick of the Dolphins in
2008 and had a 13-18 record as a starter. Henne lost all four of
his starts last season before Matt Moore took over and led Miami
to a 6-6 record the rest of the season.  Dolphins’ management has said they need to upgrade at
quarterback position and will probably seek to do so through
free agency or the draft, the Sun-Sentinel said.  Henne has completed almost 61 percent of his passes over
four NFL seasons, throwing for 7,114 yards, 31 touchdowns and 37
interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
