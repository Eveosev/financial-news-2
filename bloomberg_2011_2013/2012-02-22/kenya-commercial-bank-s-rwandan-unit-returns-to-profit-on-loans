Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) ’s Rwandan
unit returned to profit last year as loans almost tripled, said

compared with a loss of 1.7 billion francs a year earlier,
Toroitich said in an interview today in Kigali, the capital.  The bank’s loan book grew to 35 billion francs, from 13
billion francs in 2010, while customer deposits increased 47
percent to 47 billion francs, he said.  “This year, we are looking forward to another profitable
year and we expect 50 percent overall growth,” Toroitich said.
He declined to provide more specific details.  Kenya  Commercial is Kenya’s biggest bank by outlets. The
lender has 10 branches in Rwanda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
