China ’s energy use rose at the
fastest pace in four years in 2011 and efficiency improved,
according to the National Bureau of Statistics.  Consumption climbed 7 percent to 3.48 billion metric tons
of standard coal equivalent, a  report  on the bureau’s website
showed today. That’s the fastest rate since 2007, when it was
7.8 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Consumption per unit of gross domestic product fell 2.01 percent
from 2010, the bureau said, without elaborating.  The data underscore China’s increasing share of world
energy demand even as the nation attempts to curb the cost of
powering its factories and reduce pollution. The government
wants to cut energy use per unit of gross domestic product by 16
percent in the five years through 2015.  “The nation’s energy use has been supported by strong coal
demand,” Aochao Wang, head of China research at UOB-Kay Hian
Ltd., said by telephone from  Shanghai . “The increased use of
coal constrains the nation’s efforts in improving  energy
efficiency .”  Demand for coal, which China relies on for about 70 percent
of its energy needs, rose 9.7 percent in 2011 from a year
earlier, according to today’s report, which didn’t give absolute
volumes. That’s the highest growth since 2005. Crude-oil use
increased 2.7 percent, natural gas gained 12 percent and
electricity demand expanded 11.7 percent.  Differing Measures  Total energy use by the world’s second-biggest economy rose
to the equivalent of 96.66 thousand trillion British thermal
units, according to conversion rates from China’s government and
the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. consumed
97.88 thousand trillion, according to the EIA’s Feb. 7  Short-
Term Energy Outlook Report .  China overtook the U.S. in 2009 to become the world’s
biggest energy consumer, according to a measure of million tons
of oil equivalent by the Paris-based  International Energy Agency 
in July 2010. China’s government refuted the claim at the time.  The Asian nation became the biggest consumer in 2010 with
20.3 percent of global energy demand compared with 19 percent
for the U.S, according to BP Plc’s Statistical Review of World
Energy, which also used tons of oil equivalent.  China’s standard coal has an energy value of 7,000
kilocalories per kilogram. One kilocalorie converts to 3.968
British thermal units, according to the EIA.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
