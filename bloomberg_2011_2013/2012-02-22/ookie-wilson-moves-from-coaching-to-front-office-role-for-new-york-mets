Former  New York Mets  outfielder
Mookie Wilson will move to the front office of the Major League
Baseball team after not being retained as first-base coach.  Wilson, 56, whose grounder went through the legs of Boston
Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner to score the winning run in
the sixth game of the 1986 World Series, will handle baseball
and business duties for the club.  “I’m glad to be back,” said Wilson, who played for the
Mets in 1980-89 before spending his final three seasons with
Toronto. “I will get a chance to work with the players in the
spring and during the year. Plus, I will be able to look at some
of our younger players, which I love doing.”  Wilson was told shortly after the end of last season that
he wouldn’t return as first-base coach. He was replaced by Tom
Goodwin.  Wilson will work with major and minor league players during
spring training, as well as the minor league affiliates during
the season, the team said yesterday in a release.  “This year we will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of
Mets baseball and I’m looking forward to getting out there and
talking to fans both at the ballpark and in the community,”
said Wilson, who was inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame in 1996.  Boston needed one out to win the 1986  World Series  in Game
Six when the Mets rallied in the bottom of the 10th inning.
Wilson’s grounder went through Buckner’s legs and allowed Ray Knight to score the game-winning run. The Mets went on to win
the championship in Game Seven.  In 1,403 games from 1980-1991, Wilson had a .274 batting
average with 1,397 hits, 438 runs batted in and 67 home runs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
