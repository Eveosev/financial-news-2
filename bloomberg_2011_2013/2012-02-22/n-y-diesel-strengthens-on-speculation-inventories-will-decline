New York  diesel prices strengthened
amid speculation that supplies of distillate have declined.  Inventories of distillate , a category including  diesel
fuel , dropped 1.5 million barrels to 142.2 million last week,
according to the median estimate of 10 analysts polled by
Bloomberg News. The government will release inventory statistics
at 11 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  The premium for  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in New York Harbor
gained 0.25 cent to 3.88 cents a gallon versus heating oil
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:38 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
3.56 cents to $3.3112 a gallon.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  at the same hub  gained
1.13 cents to a premium versus futures of 1.13 cents a gallon.
The prompt-delivery price rose 2.88 cents to $3.099 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
