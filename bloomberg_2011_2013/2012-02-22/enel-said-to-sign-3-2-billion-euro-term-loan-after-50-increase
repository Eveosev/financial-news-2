Enel SA signed a 3.2 billion-euro
($4.2 billion) loan to refinance debt, exceeding the Italian
power company’s original target by more than 1 billion euros,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The self-arranged, five-year  term loan  was provided by 25
banks and pays interest of 3 percentage points more than the
euro interbank offered rate, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private.  The borrowing was increased from 2 billion euros after
lenders offered more than Rome-based Enel sought, three people
with knowledge of the deal said yesterday.  Proceeds of the loan will refinance the remainder of a 35
billion-euro financing signed in 2007 due in April. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Enel is ranked A- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings,
and an equivalent A- by Moody’s Investors Service rates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
