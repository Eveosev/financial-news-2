Taiwan ’s dollar weakened for a
second day as oil prices at a nine-month high and concern
 Greece ’s bailout won’t resolve  Europe ’s debt crisis deterred
risk-taking. Government bonds were little changed.  Crude oil for April delivery advanced almost 8 percent this
month and touched $106.41 a barrel today, the highest since May
5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A second rescue
package for Greece may not be enough to end the debt crisis,
Bank of England Deputy Governor Charlie Bean said yesterday.
Foreign funds sold $39 million more Taiwanese stocks than they
bought yesterday, exchange data show.  “Investors prefer safety over risk given the recent spike
in oil prices and the Greek debt talks,” said Eric Hsing, a
fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.  The  Taiwan dollar  declined 0.05 percent to NT$29.582
against its U.S. counterpart in Taipei, according to Taipei
Forex Inc.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 was at 1.280 percent, compared with 1.282 percent
yesterday, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  Benchmark
10-year rates  reached 1.260 percent on Feb. 16, the lowest
closing level since Dec. 19.  The island has no plan to increase borrowings above current
budget estimates, Finance Minister Christina Liu said yesterday
at a briefing in Taipei. Taiwan hopes to attract more private
investment in public infrastructure such as build-operate-
transfer projects, Liu said.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was unchanged 0.398 percent, according to
a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
