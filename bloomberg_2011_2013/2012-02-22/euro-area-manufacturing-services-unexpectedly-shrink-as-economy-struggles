European services and manufacturing
output unexpectedly shrank in February as the euro-area economy
struggles to rebound from a contraction in the fourth quarter.  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries dropped to 49.7 from 50.4 in
January, London-based Markit Economics said in an initial
estimate released by e-mail today. Economists had forecast a
reading of 50.5, according to the median of 16 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Budget cuts by governments may curb the pace of recovery as
countries across the region battle the sovereign-debt crisis.
 Greece  yesterday reached a debt-swap deal with its private
creditors aimed at averting default and ending a fiscal crisis
that has damped confidence across the continent.   “We see some signs of stabilization, but it’s still too
weak to conclude that we’ll be able to avert a recession,” said
Jens Kramer, an economist at NordLB in Hanover,  Germany .
“Germany and  France  helped counter some of the slack, but
tougher consolidation measures in countries like Spain or
 Portugal  will continue, which means that it will probably have a
negative impact on the economic performance into 2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
