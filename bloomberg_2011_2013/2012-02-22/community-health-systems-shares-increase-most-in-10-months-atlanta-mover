Community Health  Systems, the
second-largest U.S. hospital operator, surged the most in 10
months after reporting earnings that beat analyst estimates.  Community Health gained 15 percent to $23.85 at 4 p.m. New
York time, the biggest increase since April 12. The shares have
fallen 36 percent in the last 12 months.  Fourth-quarter profit excluding some items was 85 cents a
share, the Franklin, Tennessee-based company said in a statement
yesterday. The results beat by three cents the average estimate
of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The hospital operator
reported a 3.5 percent decline in total admissions, a drop the
company will work this year to reverse, said Frank Morgan, the
analyst with  RBC Capital Markets  in Brentwood,  Tennessee .  “The results were reasonable and I think there are some
encouraging signs,” Morgan said in a telephone interview.
“They are going through a very weak period in volume and we
think over the next quarters we could see some improvement.”  Net income fell to 35 cents a share from 77 cents after an
after-tax charge of 47 cents from debt retirement, Community
Health said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
