Provisional results from Senegal’s
Feb. 26 presidential election will be released by the country’s
electoral commission by March 2, Serigne Mbacke Ndiaye, a
spokesman for President  Abdoulaye Wade , said today.  The outcome will be delivered to the president of the
 Constitutional Court , Senegal’s highest legal authority, by
midnight at the latest that day, Ndiaye told reporters in Dakar,
the capital, today.  Wade, 85, faces 13 candidates in the election after a
campaign marked by protests against his bid to stay in office
for a third term. At least nine people have died in
demonstrations held since Jan. 27, when the court approved
Wade’s candidacy, according to  Amnesty International ’s Senegal
office.  Police haven’t been “armed with live bullets” in the
protests, Ndiaye said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
