Germanyâ€™s benchmark stock index, the
DAX Index, fell 0.4 percent at 9:51 a.m. as the 30-member index
declined 29.68 to 6,878.50.  Among the stocks in the index, 24 fell and 6 rose as 
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  led declines.  The DAX extended an early decline after German services and
manufacturing expansion unexpectedly slowed in February amid
declining orders at factories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
