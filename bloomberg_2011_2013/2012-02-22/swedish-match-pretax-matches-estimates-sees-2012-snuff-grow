Swedish Match AB (SWMA) , Europe’s largest
maker of smokeless tobacco products, posted a 27 percent drop in
fourth-quarter pretax profit, matching analysts’ estimates, and
predicted snuff-market growth in Scandinavia and the U.S.  Pretax profit fell to 888 million kronor ($134 million)
from 1.22 billion kronor a year earlier, when earnings included
a one-time operating gain of 585 million kronor, and compared
with the average estimate of 887 million kronor in a Bloomberg
survey of 10 analysts’ estimates.  “For the full year 2012, we expect continued growth in
revenues and comparable operating profit led by a solid
development for snus and snuff and other tobacco products,” the
Stockholm-based company said in a statement today.  Swedish Match expects both the Scandinavian snus market and
the U.S. market for moist snuff to continue to grow in volume
terms this year, the seller of Red Man and Timber Wolf chewing
tobacco said in the statement. Snus is finely ground tobacco
that doesn’t require spitting, unlike traditional smokeless
tobacco. Traditional snuff is more popular in the U.S., and the
market there is five times larger than the Scandinavian market
for snus, according to the company.  The operating margin for snus and snuff fell to 45.9
percent from 48.1 percent a year earlier, missing the average
estimate of 47.6 percent in a survey of 19 analysts by SME
Direkt.  Fourth-quarter net income fell 34 percent to 705 million
kronor from 1.07 billion kronor a year earlier. That compared
with the 724 million-krona  estimate  of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The company proposed an increase of dividend to 6.50
kronor a share for 2011 from 5.50 kronor a year earlier,
compared with a Bloomberg estimate of 6.20 kronor.  Swedish Match’s shares were trading up 5.6 kronor, or 2.3
percent, at 11 a.m. in  Stockholm ,  valuing  the company at about
53 billion kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
