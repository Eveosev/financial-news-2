Zillow Inc. (Z) , the Seattle-based
online provider of home-price data, fell in New York trading
following reports of stock sales by executives.  The company fell 6.1 percent to $28.76 at the close, after
dropping 6.4 percent yesterday. The stock has declined from a
five-month high of $36.60 reached Feb. 16, a day after Zillow
said fourth-quarter revenue doubled from a year earlier.  Chairman  Richard Barton  sold 375,000 shares at $31.25 each,
for a total of $11.7 million, on Feb. 21, Washington Service
reported yesterday. Lloyd Frink, Zillow’s vice chairman and
president, sold 510,400 shares at prices between $31.25 and
$34.16 a share, or at least $16 million, from Feb. 16 to Feb.
21, according to Washington Service.  “Investors are seeing the headlines around insider sales
and that’s causing some concern,” Chad Bartley, senior research
analyst at Pacific Crest Securities Inc. in Portland,  Oregon ,
said in a telephone interview. “The stock is expensive.”  At about $35 a share, Zillow was trading at about 50 times
estimated 2013 earnings, the highest multiple after  Amazon.com
Inc. (AMZN)  among companies Bartley covers, he said.  Cynthia Nowak, a Zillow spokeswoman, said the stock sales
were the executives’ “personal decision.” She declined to
comment on the share-price decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
