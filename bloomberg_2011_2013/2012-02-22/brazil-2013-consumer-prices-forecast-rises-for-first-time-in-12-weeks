Economists covering  Brazil  raised
their forecast for inflation next year for the first time in 12
weeks, after retail sales grew more than expected and the
central bank signaled further interest rate cuts.  Consumer prices will increase 5.02 percent next year, from
a forecast of 5.00 percent the previous week, according to the
median forecast in a Feb. 17  central bank survey  of about 100
economists published today. Consumer prices, as measured by the
 IPCA index , will rise 5.24 percent this year, from a week
earlier forecast of 5.29 percent, the survey found.  Economists expect policy makers to cut the benchmark rate
half a percentage point, to 10 percent, at the March policy
meeting, and to 9.5 percent by the end of the year, the survey
found. The economy’s recent “below potential” growth has
opened up space for further rate cuts without stoking inflation,
central bank President Alexandre Tombini said in Mumbai this
month.  Economists held their estimate for economic growth this
year at 3.3 percent.  Latin America ’s largest economy will expand
4.1 percent next year, also unchanged from the previous week’s
forecast, according to the survey.  Consumer prices  rose less than economists expected through
mid-February, taking the mid-month inflation rate below 6
percent for the first time since December 2010. Brazil targets
consumer price rises of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points. Inflation exceeded the upper limit of the
target for eight months last year.  Retail sales rose 6.7 percent in December from a year
earlier, higher than the 6.0 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of 40 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
