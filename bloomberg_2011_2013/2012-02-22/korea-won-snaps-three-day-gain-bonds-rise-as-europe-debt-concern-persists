South Korea’s won declined for the
first time in four days on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will
linger following a Greek bailout deal.  Government bonds  were
steady.  Euro-area finance ministers approved 130 billion euros
($172 billion) in aid for  Greece  yesterday by tapping into
European Central Bank profits and coaxing investors into
providing more debt relief. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of shares advanced
0.2 percent as overseas investors bought more Korean shares than
they sold for a fourth day, building on net purchases of $8.5
billion this year through yesterday.  “With the euro-region finance ministers’ meeting over,
it’s hard to find momentum for currencies to gain,” said Kim Seong Soo, a Seoul-based currency dealer at Kyongnam Bank. “We
are seeing the won trade within a range, with South Korean
exporters and importers buying and selling dollars whenever
there are moves.”  The won slid 0.3 percent to 1,126.00 per dollar in Seoul,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It strengthened 0.8
percent in the last three days.  The yield on  South Korea ’s 3.25 percent debt due December
2014 was unchanged at 3.47 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. Three-year bond futures rose 0.02 percent to 104.15. The
one-year interest-rate swap advanced two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.50 percent.  “The majority opinion in the market is that the Greek aid
has merely delayed the country’s default, so the agreement
reached yesterday won’t be enough to weaken demand for South
Korea’s bonds,” Kim Nam Hyun, a Seoul-based fixed income
analyst at Eugene Investment & Futures, wrote in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
