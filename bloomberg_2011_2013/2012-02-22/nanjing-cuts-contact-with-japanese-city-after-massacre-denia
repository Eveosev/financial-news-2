The Chinese city of Nanjing cut ties
with Nagoya in  Japan  after its mayor denied that Japanese troops
killed tens of thousands of Nanjing citizens in 1937.  The denial of the Nanjing Massacre “seriously damages the
feelings of the people of Nanjing,” the city said in a  posting 
on its official Sina Corp. microblog yesterday. “Nanjing is
temporarily cutting off official contacts with Nagoya’s
government.”  The Chinese government, which filed a formal protest over
the remarks by Mayor Takashi Kawamura, supports the decision by
Nanjing city officials, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said
at a regular briefing in Beijing today. Nanjing and Nagoya are
sister cities.  Kawamura was quoted by the Kyodo News Agency as  telling  a
visiting Nanjing official on Feb. 20 that he believed only
“conventional acts of combat” took place in Nanjing, not rape
and mass murder.  Japan occupied large sections of  China  during a 1937-1945
war in which millions of Chinese died. Tens of thousands were
killed during the 1937 sacking of Nanjing, which was the capital
of the Nationalist government at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
