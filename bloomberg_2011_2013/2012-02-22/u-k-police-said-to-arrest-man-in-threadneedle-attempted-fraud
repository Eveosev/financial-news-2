London police arrested a 32-year-old
man as part of an investigation into an attempted $150 million
trading fraud at  Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP) ’s U.K. investment
unit Threadneedle, according to a person familiar with the case.  The man was arrested in October, according to the person,
who declined to be identified because they weren’t authorized to
speak on the matter.  The Minneapolis-based insurer and money manager said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday that it blocked a “suspicious
attempted trade” at  Threadneedle  in August 2011.  “The matter was immediately reported to the authorities
and the individual involved was subsequently dismissed,”
Threadneedle spokeswoman  Alison Jefferis  said in the statement.
She declined to comment today on the arrest.  Threadneedle has $114 billion in assets under management,
she said.  City of London Police “have been in contact with
Threadneedle as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into a
suspected $150 million trading fraud,” the department said in a
statement.  Ameriprise, under Chief Executive Officer James Cracchiolo,
has been working to increase the proportion of its profits
generated by its investment management and advisory businesses.
The company was spun off from American Express Co. in 2005.  “The main point is the attempt was stopped by our systems
and there was no loss as a result to our clients,” Jefferis
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
