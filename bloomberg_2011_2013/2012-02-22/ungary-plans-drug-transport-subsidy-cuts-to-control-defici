Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  plans savings on drugs, transportation and other areas to
help meet budget targets this year and next, according to a
decree published in the government’s Magyar Kozlony newspaper.  Ministers must present proposals by the end of February on
cutting drug subsidies and reducing payments next year for
public transport in Budapest, according to the decree signed by
Orban and published yesterday.  The order also suspended government outlays on most
purchases of furniture, cars, computers and telephones, except
when authorized by  Mihaly Varga , Orban’s chief of staff, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
