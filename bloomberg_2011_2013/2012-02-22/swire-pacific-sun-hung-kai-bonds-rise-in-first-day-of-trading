Swire Pacific Ltd.’s (19)  first dollar-
denominated bonds in more than two years rose in Asian trading
after investors offered to buy more than ten times the notes on
offer.  Swire, which owns Hong Kong developer Swire Properties
Ltd., sold $500 million of ten-year notes yesterday priced to
yield 260 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread narrowed to
249 basis points, or 2.49 percentage points, as of 3:28 p.m. in
Hong Kong, prices from BNP Paribas SA show.  Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd. (16)  also gained after the real-estate company
increased the size of an existing issue.  “The syndicated loan market was quite tight in 2011, so
developers such as Swire and Sun Hung Kai have been
opportunistic,” Agnes Wong, a credit strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc. said by telephone today from  Hong Kong . “They
want to be well prepared for refinancing and are probably
looking for land supply in the future. We expect to see a few
more names.”  Hong Kong developers sold $7.28 billion of debt this year,
the busiest quarter on record, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Lending to the city’s real estate companies slumped
in the second half to the lowest in two years amid increased
demand for loans from Chinese corporates.  Swire Pacific sold debt as Sun Hung Kai added $400 million
to its 4.5 percent 2022 notes. Shui On Land Ltd. plans to sell
more of its 9.75 percent bonds due 2015, it said in a statement
to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  Investor Demand  The premium on Sun Hung Kai’s 4.5 percent 2022 notes
tightened to 262 basis points as of 3:29 p.m., Credit Agricole
SA prices show. It sold $400 million more of the bonds at a
spread of 270 basis points yesterday.  Swire Pacific last sold dollar notes in August 2009, when
it raised $500 million from a 5.5 percent bond due August 2019,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The company got more than $5 billion of orders from 280
accounts for its latest sale, a quarter of which came from
 Europe , according to a person familiar with the matter. Funds
bought more than half the deal, with banks taking almost 20
percent and private banks and insurers picking up 10 percent
each, the person said, asking not to be identified because the
details are private.  Sun Hung Kai’s sale was more than five times
oversubscribed, with 88 percent allocated to accounts in  Asia , a
person with knowledge of the sale said, asking not to be named
for confidentiality reasons. Funds took more than 50 percent of
the trade and insurers bought almost 25 percent, the person
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
