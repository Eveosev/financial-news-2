The 30-stock  Micex (MICEX)  index fell 1.3
percent to 1,538.17 by the close in Moscow. The dollar-
denominated RTS index declined 0.8 percent to 1,642.01.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Etalon Group Ltd. (ETLN)  (ETLN LI) surged 3.1 percent to $6 in
 London , headed for its strongest close in almost seven months.
The company, which builds high-rise apartment blocks in Moscow
and  St. Petersburg , advanced after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
lifted its share price estimate to $10.50 from $8.50, citing
real wage growth and  consumer confidence .  OAO Lukoil (LKOH)  (LKOH RX) fell 3.2 percent, its biggest drop
since Dec. 9, to 1,778.9 rubles. Russia’s second-largest oil
producer retreated for a second day after Chief Executive
Officer  Vagit Alekperov  said the company plans to spend $155
billion through 2021, Interfax reported yesterday. “With such
capex, we would have difficulty understanding how the company’s
promise to raise the dividend payout can be carried out,”
Troika Dialog analysts wrote in a research note today.  AFK Sistema (AFKS)  (AFKS RX) advanced 2 percent to 27.003 rubles,
the biggest gain in a week. Chief Executive Officer Mikhail
Shamolin said the company would decide on a new share buyback
“soon.” Sistema’s London-traded global depositary receipts
advanced as much as 1.2 percent before trading down 0.9 percent
at $20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
