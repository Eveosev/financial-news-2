German stocks  retreated for a second
day after manufacturing and services expansion unexpectedly
slowed amid declining orders at factories.  TUI AG (TUI1) , Europe’s largest travel company, slumped 7.6
percent after Banco CAM SAU sold a 77.5 million-euro ($103
million) stake.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  lost 2.6 percent after
saying five days of strikes at Frankfurt Airport have cost it
more than 10 million euros as it canceled further flights today.  Germany ’s benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index fell 0.9 percent to 6,843.87
at the close in Frankfurt. The gauge has still  advanced 16
percent  so far this year, outperforming a 12 percent climb in
gold and every developed stock market except  Hong Kong .
Yesterday, the measure declined from a six-month high as an
agreement on  Greece ’s bailout failed to ease concern that the
nation’s debt crisis will persist. The broader HDAX also lost
0.9 percent today.  “Investors have been looking for an excuse to sell stocks
and consolidate after the very strong start to the year,” said
Henrik Henriksen, the chief investment strategist at PFA Pension
A/S in Copenhagen, where he helps manage $45 billion. “The
outlook for risky assets such as stocks is still good, though
systemic risks persist in  Europe , while it’s hard to see what
should drive the markets in the immediate future.”  A German composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing fell to 52.9 this month
from 53.9 in January, London-based Markit Economics said today.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion. A  manufacturing gauge 
for Germany slid to 50.1 this month from 51, while a  services
index  for the country fell to 52.6 from 53.7.  TUI Slides  TUI slumped 7.6 percent to 5.99 euros after Banco CAM sold
12.9 million shares for 6.05 euros apiece.  The travel company has still  jumped 25 percent this year  as
it said it will sell a stake in Hapag-Lloyd and may dispose of
its remaining holding in the shipper in an initial public
offering. It also  forecast  higher revenue for 2012.  Lufthansa fell 2.6 percent to 10.49 euros. The Gewerkschaft
der Flugsicherung union will suspend  strike action  at Frankfurt
airport tonight after accepting an offer of unconditional talks.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany’s largest lender , dropped 2.4
percent to 33.04 euros.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , the second-biggest bank,
fell 3.3 percent to 2.07 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
