The U.K.’s sugar-beet crop will be a
record this year after favorable weather boosted output, said
William Martin, NFU Sugar board chairman.  Rainfall last autumn boosted soil moisture just after
planting, increasing yields, Martin said, adding that dry
weather last summer didn’t curb the crop. He didn’t specify a
figure for production.  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)  on Jan. 19
forecast output at 1.25 million metric tons this year versus
just under 1 million tons last year.  “Our yields are higher than they’ve ever been before,”
Martin said at the National Farmers Union conference in
Birmingham. “Last year, the weather we had was very beneficial.
It was a dry summer and we were nervous about the impact it was
having on sugar beets but it ended up working out very well and
farmers are very happy.”  U.K. farmers will probably plant about the same amount of
sugar beets next season as this year because demand for the
sweetener has increased and production this year may be
accounted for, Martin said.  “The area should be almost the same next year,” he said.
“Our customers were able to use all the sugar we produced, so
they’re keen for us to grow a similar amount again next year.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
