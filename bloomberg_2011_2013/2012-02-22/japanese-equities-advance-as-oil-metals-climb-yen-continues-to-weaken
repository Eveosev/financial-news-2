fifth year of recession, looming elections and social unrest.  Automakers Advance  Carmakers contributed the most to the Topix’s gain among
its 33 industry groups after the yen fell to 80.08 against the
dollar today. The yen weakened for a fifth day against the
greenback on speculation accelerating U.S. economic growth will
reduce the case for more quantitative easing from the  Federal

to 3,980 yen, after SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. boosted its
rating to “outperform” from “neutral.”  Shares in railways, retail and other industries that are
less sensitive to the global economy gained. “Investors are
spreading their purchases to defensive stocks after focusing on
sensitive stocks,” Shinkin Asset’s Fujiwara said. “That’s
supporting the markets.”  East Japan Railway Co. (9020) , Japan’s largest railway operator,
advanced 2.1 percent to 5,340 yen. Fast Retailing Co.,  Asia ’s
biggest clothing retailer, added 1 percent to 16,610 yen.  The Topix’s rise has  increased  the value of its listed
stocks to 1.01 times book value, up from 0.88 in December. The
