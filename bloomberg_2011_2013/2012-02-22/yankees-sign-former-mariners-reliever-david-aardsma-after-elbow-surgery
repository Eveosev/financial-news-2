The  New York Yankees  signed former
Seattle Mariners reliever David Aardsma, who collected 67 saves
in 2009-10, to a one-year contract.  Aardsma, a right-hander who underent ligament-replacement
surgery in his pitching elbow in July, didn’t play in the major
leagues last year.  The signing comes two days after  Mariano Rivera , baseball’s
career leader with 603 saves, said he has made up his mind
already on whether to pitch after this season. Rivera, 42, told
reporters he will reveal his decision during the season.  Aardsma, 30, has 69 saves and a 4.20 earned run average
over six seasons. The Yankees have a contract option to keep
Aardsma for the 2013 season, the team said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
