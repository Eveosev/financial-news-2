While Republicans promote themselves
as the friendliest party for  Wall Street , stock investors do
better when Democrats occupy the White House. From a dollars-
and-cents standpoint, it’s not even close.  The BGOV Barometer shows that, over the five decades since
 John F. Kennedy  was inaugurated, $1,000 invested in a
hypothetical fund that tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX) 
only when Democrats are in the White House would have been worth
$10,920 at the close of trading yesterday.  That’s more than nine times the dollar return an investor
would have realized from following a similar strategy during
Republican administrations. A $1,000 stake invested in a fund
that followed the S&P 500 under Republican presidents, starting
with  Richard Nixon , would have grown to $2,087 on the day  George
W. Bush  left office.  “The market does tend to do better under Democrats than
under Republicans,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at
S&P Equity Research in  New York , said in a telephone interview.
“Is it because Republicans mishandled the economy, or inherited
a weak economy? I’ll leave that to others.”  Some of the difference may stem from the fact that every
Republican president since at least the end of World War II has
faced a  recession  during his first term in office, Stovall said.
Nine of 11 recessions that began since 1945 -- and seven of
eight since Kennedy ran for president in 1960 --started with
Republicans in the Oval Office.  Wall Street Republicans  Democratic administrations also may be more likely to spend
money on government programs that stimulate the economy, Stovall
said.  “I dare say that most people on Wall Street are
Republicans,” Stovall said. “But it appears the bread is
buttered on the Democratic side.”  The  S&P 500  yesterday hit its highest intra-day level since
June 2008 and closed at 1,362.21, the highest since last April
29. The benchmark index is up 8.3 percent so far in 2012, the
biggest year-to-date gain at this point since 1991.  Since Kennedy took office, the Democratic S&P fund logged a
992 percent gain, versus 109 percent growth for the opposition
party, even though Democrats occupied the White House for 23
years over the period, compared with 28 years of Republican
presidential leadership.  The annualized return for 23 years of Democratic
administrations is 11 percent, or four times the 2.7 percent
annualized return during 28 years of Republican presidencies.  Democratic Edge  Investing $1,000 in funds that mirror the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  under the same conditions, Democratic
investors would have had $7,550, versus $2,716 under
Republicans.  The Democratic edge is so large that the party comes out
ahead even without counting  Bill Clinton  (the Democrat with the
biggest S&P 500 gain) and George W. Bush (the Republican with
the worst market record). A hypothetical $1,000 investment under
Democrats excluding Clinton was worth $3,539 versus $3,296
invested under Republicans except Bush.  Adding Dwight Eisenhower to the Republican column doesn’t
overcome the Democratic advantage, either: $1,000 invested in
the S&P 500 in January 1953 would have been worth $4,796 after
36 years under Republican chief executives -- still less than
half the $10,920 nest egg accumulated in 23 years under
Democrats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
