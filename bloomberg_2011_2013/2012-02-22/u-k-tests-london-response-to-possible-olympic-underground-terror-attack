The U.K. is staging an exercise
today to test the response of the emergency services and
government to a possible terrorist attack on  London ’s
Underground rail system during this summer’s Olympic Games.  The former Aldwych station, in central London, will be the
focus of the simulated attack, which is being coordinated by the
 Home Office  and London’s Metropolitan Police.  “The initial incident will test the tactical response,
including evacuation of the station, rescuing injured people and
managing the crime scene,”  Chris Allison , the national Olympic
security coordinator, said in an e-mailed statement. “The
exercise will go on to test how senior decision makers manage
the impact of the incident, the investigation to catch those
responsible and a range of issues such as travel disruption,
protest and organized crime which may impact on the smooth
running of the  Olympic Games .”  The U.K. armed forces will call up 2,100 reservists to make
up the 13,500 military personnel assisting with security at the
games, Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said on Feb. 20. HMS
Ocean, the Royal Navy’s biggest ship, will be moored in the
 River Thames , while ground-to-air missiles and Typhoon jets will
protect the U.K. capital’s airspace.  “We are determined to leave nothing to chance to deliver a
safe and secure games that London, the U.K. and the world can
enjoy,” James Brokenshire, the crime and security minister,
said in the statement. “We need to test our plans and this
exercise gives us the opportunity to inform, reassure and build
confidence in the U.K.’s safety and security operation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
