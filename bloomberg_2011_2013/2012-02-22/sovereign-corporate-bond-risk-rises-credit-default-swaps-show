The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased 11 basis points to 349 basis points at
3:30 p.m. in London, the highest in almost a month. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings were 7.5 basis
points higher at 579.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose two basis points to 133 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 8.5 basis points to 225 and
the subordinated gauge was 12 higher at 380.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
