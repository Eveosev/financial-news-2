Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) ,  Canada ’s
largest wireless carrier, said fourth-quarter earnings rose 8.3
percent, helped by wireless revenue as customers spent more time
on smartphones.  Net income climbed to C$327 million ($328 million), or 61
cents a share, from C$302 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier,
the Toronto-based company said today in a statement. Rogers also
said it will buy back as much as C$1 billion of stock and raised
its annualized dividend by 11 percent to C$1.58 a share.  Chief Executive Officer Nadir Mohamed is trying to stay
ahead of  BCE Inc. (BCE)  and  Telus Corp. (T)  by touting Rogers’s network
speed while also promoting its no-frills Chatr business. BCE and
Telus posted quarterly earnings that trailed estimates as they
spent more subsidizing expensive smartphones to avoid losing
subscribers to Canada’s new carriers that offer mainly cheaper,
contract-free plans.  Wireless competition remains “intense,” Mohamed said on a
conference call with analysts. Even though Rogers said it sold
more smartphones, including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone, last quarter,
Rogers’s churn -- or defection rate for customers on contract --
increased to 1.49 percent last quarter from 1.35 percent a year
earlier.  “We have some work to do” reducing churn, Rob Bruce, the
head of Rogers’s wireless business, said on the call.  Rogers advanced 1 percent to C$38.15 at the close in
Toronto. The  shares  have dropped 2.8 percent this year.  Sales Climb  Sales rose 1.2 percent to C$3.18 billion, missing the C$3.2
billion average projection by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  During the quarter, Rogers added 42,000 subscribers on
contracts, the long-term customers who typically buy a
smartphone and spend more on data. That was down from 49,000 a
year earlier and missed the 85,000 estimate of Maher Yaghi, a
Desjardins Securities analyst in  Montreal . He rates Rogers
shares “hold.” On that basis, BCE added 131,986 subscribers
last quarter and Telus gained 148,000.  “Rogers continues to underperform Telus and Bell in
wireless subscriber additions however the company has been able
to contain costs in both its wireless and cable business to grow
earnings in the face of flat revenue,” Yaghi said in a research
note.  Rogers’s average monthly revenue from both contract and
prepaid customers, who usually opt for cheaper calling plans,
was C$58.82, down from C$61.31 a year earlier and also missing
Yaghi’s C$59.20 estimate.  The annualized dividend rises to C$1.58 from C$1.42,
starting with a quarterly payout of 39.5 cents on April 2 to
shares of record March 19.  Per-share  profit  excluding some items rose to 70 cents,
exceeding the 65 cent average of  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
