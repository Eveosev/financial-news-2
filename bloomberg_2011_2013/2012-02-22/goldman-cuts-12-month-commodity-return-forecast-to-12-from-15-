Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut its 12-
month prediction for commodity returns, while forecasting gains
for crude oil and gold and keeping an “overweight” allocation
in raw materials.  The bank reduced its estimate for returns to 12 percent
from 15 percent after prices rallied this year, analysts led by
 Jeffrey Currie  said in a report today. They kept their
predictions for Brent and gold at $127.50 a barrel and $1,940 an
ounce compared with $121.23 and $1,755.30 today.  Commodities advanced 8.5 percent this year to the highest
level in six months as measured by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials. Prices climbed as the  U.S. economy 
strengthened and the Chinese central bank cut reserve
requirements. While Morgan Stanley is also bullish on gold, it
expects  oil prices  to decline in the first half as supply
recovers and demand slows, it said in a report Feb. 20.  “With much of the ‘value’ opportunities behind us, we look
to fundamental drivers for further expected gains in 2012, which
we believe will be centered in the oil complex,” said Goldman.
Oil climbed to a nine-month high in  New York  yesterday after
Greece won a second bailout. Gold advanced 12 percent this year.  The bank is bullish on oil because the price is vulnerable
to supply disruptions from Iran and elsewhere and OPEC spare
capacity is “at a trough” just as the world economic recovery
is gaining momentum, it said.  Iran, China  The European Union agreed last month to ban crude imports
from  Iran  starting July 1 to increase pressure on the country
over its nuclear program. The Middle Eastern country said Feb.
19 it stopped selling crude to France and Britain.  Brent for April delivery fell 0.4 percent to $121.23 in
 London  today and gold for the same month in New York declined
0.2 percent to $1,755.30.  Manufacturing in  China , the biggest consumer of energy and
industrial metals, may shrink for a fourth month in February,
indicating the economy remains vulnerable to a deeper slowdown
as  Europe ’s crisis caps exports and the home market cools.  The preliminary 49.7 reading of an index from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics today compared with a final 48.8 in
January. A number below 50 signals a contraction. January and
February economic data are distorted by a weeklong holiday.  “Chinese construction activity and consumer appliance
output remain relatively weak,” the Goldman analysts said.
“Recent fundamental developments leave us happy to stay on the
sidelines” of industrial metals for now, it said.  The bank predicts copper and aluminum at $9,000 a ton and
$2,400 a ton in 12 months compared with $8,421.50 and $2,257 now.  The analysts see “little outright opportunity” in
agriculture, predicting lower prices in wheat and corn in 12
months and a 2 percent gain in soybeans.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
