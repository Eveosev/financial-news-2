General Motors Co. (GM)  invested
$70 million in a distribution center in Dubai to supply parts
for Chevrolets and other vehicles as the world’s largest
automaker expands in the  Middle East .  The carmaker bought the facility, located in Dubai’s Jebel
Ali Free Zone, for $10 million, and stocked it with parts valued
at $60 million, Detroit-based GM said today in an e-mailed
statement. The center will supply replacement and service parts
for GM’s Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC brands.  “We plan to grow our business in this region by making
continued investments in our showrooms, service centers and
training academies,” John Stadwick, president and managing
director of GM’s Middle East operations, said in the statement.  The center has 150 workers who aim to supply any vehicle
part within 48 hours, GM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
