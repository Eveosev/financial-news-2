Cypriot banks will suffer the
second-highest losses from the haircut on Greek debt after
 Greece ’s own lenders, state radio CyBC reported today, citing
economist George Charalambous.  The losses for the Cypriot banks, which hold 5 billion
euros ($6.6 billion) in Greek government securities, are
equivalent to 20 percent of Cyprus’s economy, Nicosia-based CyBC
said, citing Charalambous. He served as chairman of the
 Securities and Exchange Commission  from 2006 to 2011.  -- Editors:  Chris Peterson , Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
