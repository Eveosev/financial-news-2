The Confederation of British
Industry urged Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  to
make life easier for companies so that they can generate growth
and employment.  Osborne should use his March 21 budget to act on proposals
outlined in November including tax breaks to stimulate
infrastructure projects and measures to increase credit to small
companies, the CBI, Britain’s largest employers’ group, said in
a submission published today. Environmental taxes must not hurt
growth, it said.  “With our economy firmly under the international
spotlight, there is no time to lose,” Director General  John Cridland  said in a statement. “We’re calling on the government
to make some targeted changes to the U.K. tax system, which
could make an impact on business decisions and create new
opportunities for growth.”  The CBI backs Osborne’s program to reduce the  budget
deficit  and says the chancellor must ensure that taxes on
British companies are low by international standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
