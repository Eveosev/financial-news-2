Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA 
rose for a sixth straight session in Milan amid speculation that
Alessandro Profumo may be named as chairman of  Italy ’s third-
biggest bank.  The shares  rose  as much as 8.1 percent, leading gains on
the European  Stoxx 600 Banks Index (SX7P) , to their highest price since
Oct. 12. Siena, Italy-based Monte Paschi traded at 41.5 cents,
up 5.6 percent, at 11:30 a.m., giving the bank a market value of
4.8 billion euros ($6.3 billion). The shares have advanced 36
percent in the past six days.  Profumo, former chief executive officer of UniCredit SpA,
Italy’s biggest bank, is the top candidate to become Monte
Paschi chairman,  Corriere della Sera  said, without saying where
it got the information. Carlo Salvatori, chairman of Lazard Ltd.
in Italy, is also in the running for the job, the daily reported
today.  “We remain positive on Monte Paschi due to the growing
perception of improved governance,” Fabrizio Bernardi, a
banking analyst at Fidentiis Equities in Milan, said in a note
today. The brokerage has a “buy” recommendation on the stock.  Monte Paschi Chairman  Giuseppe Mussari  said last month he
won’t run for a second term after his mandate expires in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
