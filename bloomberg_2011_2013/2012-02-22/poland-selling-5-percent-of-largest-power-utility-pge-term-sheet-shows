Poland may raise as much as 2.5
billion zloty ($796 million) from the sale of a stake in  PGE SA (PGE) ,
the country’s largest power utility, two people familiar with
the transaction said.  The government is seeking to sell as much as 7 percent to
institutional investors today, with the  price range  set at 19
zloty to 19.2 zloty a share, said the people, who declined to be
named because the information is private. PGE sank 4.7 percent
to 19.32 zloty at 4:47 p.m. in Warsaw, valuing the company at
36.1 billion zloty ($11.5 billion). The transaction is set to be
the biggest state sale since the 5.4 billion-zloty public
offering of coal producer  Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA (JSW)  in June.  “They’re returning to market and trying to get more money
for their budget,”  Ed Kuczma , who helps manage $35 billion at
Van Eck Associates in  New York , said by phone.  The government is seeking to raise 10 billion zloty this
year from state-asset sales, compared with 13.1 billion zloty in
2011, to help fund spending after posting a deficit equal to
about 5.6 percent of gross domestic product last year. Poland
 sold  10 percent of the utility for 4 billion zloty in 2010, part
of an effort to raise 25 billion zloty.  Returning to Market  Treasury Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski, who supervises most
state-owned companies, declined to comment when asked about the
sale at a news conference today. The government holds stakes in
400 companies, including power producers, chemical companies as
well as PKO Bank Polski SA and PZU SA, the country’s largest
financial companies.  Warsaw-based PGE sold shares for 23 zloty apiece in its
initial public offering in 2009.  Poland  currently owns 69
percent of PGE, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Dec. 6 he would cut
the budget deficit to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product this
year, from a record 7.8 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
