RioZim Ltd. (RIOTZ) , a Zimbabwe nickel and
coal producer, is working to find funds to pay the company’s
debt, said Chief Executive Officer Josephat “Josh” Sachikonye.  “Significant progress has been made in raising the $57
million needed to solve the company’s debt,” Sachikonye said in
a telephone interview from the Harare-based miner’s headquarters
today. He didn’t give further details. RioZim separated from Rio
Tinto Plc in 2004, according to its website.  The Zimbabwe Independent newspaper earlier reported a
widening rift between RioZim and its creditor banks. An investor
the newspaper didn’t identify had agreed to a $10 million
investment to retire part of the loan, with the balance being
 underwritten  by a foreign bank, the Independent said Feb. 9.  RioZim’s creditors have applied to have the company placed
under judicial management, the newspaper said. Sachikonye
declined to comment on the application, saying only that he is
“working day and night to resolve the company’s difficulties.”  Under Zimbabwean law, financially troubled companies can be
placed under the management of a court-appointed CEO who is
given the job of returning them to profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
