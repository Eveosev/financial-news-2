Trans Mountain pipeline was oversubscribed by 69 percent for
March oil shipments, according to an e-mailed statement from the
company.  Subscriptions on the portion of the system delivering to
refineries in British Columbia and  Washington  were 72.5 percent
over capacity, the Houston-based company said in the bulletin.  The Trans Mountain mainline system is expected to carry
269,164 barrels a day in March, 2.4 percent below estimated
February shipments of 275,759, according a Jan. 23 notice.  The Puget Sound line will carry 121,489 barrels a day next
month, the company said today.  The 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) Trans Mountain system runs
from Edmonton, Alberta, to marketing terminals and refineries in
central British Columbia, the Vancouver area and the Puget Sound
region in Washington, according to the company’s website.  Products also move to California, the U.S. Gulf Coast and
overseas through the Westridge marine terminal in Burnaby,
British Columbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
