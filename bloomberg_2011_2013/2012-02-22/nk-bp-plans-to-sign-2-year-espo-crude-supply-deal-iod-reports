TNK-BP (BP/)  plans to sign a two-year
sales contract for its East Siberia Pacific Ocean crude with a
national  oil company , the International Oil Daily reported,

that the company exports from the Port of Kozmino off Russiaâ€™s
coast, Jonathan Kollek, a TNK-BP vice president, said in London
yesterday, according to the IOD. The company may sell as much as
20,000 barrels a day under the deal, the IOD said.  The buyer may be a national oil company in the Asia-Pacific
region, the IOD said without explaining where it got the
