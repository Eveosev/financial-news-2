Sales of previously owned U.S. homes
rose in January to the highest level since May 2010 as investors
took advantage of lower prices to buy distressed properties.  Purchases  climbed  4.3 percent to a 4.57 million annual
rate, less than forecast, from a revised 4.38 million pace in
December that was slower than previously estimated, a report
from the National Association of Realtors showed today in
Washington. Distressed properties made up the largest portion of
all purchases since April.  Almost one in four of all transactions was made by
investors. That’s helping to clear the market of unsold
properties and may stabilize prices. While the threat of more
foreclosures risks slowing progress, housing may get a boost
from gains in employment and mortgage rates that are near record
lows.  “I don’t think we’re seeing a full-fledged recovery in
housing,” said  Michelle Meyer , a senior economist at Bank of
America Corp. in  New York . “Outside of investors and people
wanting to buy distressed properties, the primary housing demand
is recovering much more gradually.”  Distressed sales, comprised of foreclosures and short sales
in which the lender agrees to a transaction for less than the
balance of the mortgage, accounted for 35 percent of the total
in January, up from 32 percent a month earlier.  Investors accounted for 23 percent of purchases last month,
while cash transactions were about 31 percent, about the same as
a year ago.  Stocks fell as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index failed to
hold at an almost four-year high after the reports and data that
showed struggling economies in  Europe  and  China . The  S&P 500 
dropped 0.4 percent to 1,357.06 at 12:33 p.m. in New York.  European Economy  In Europe, services and manufacturing unexpectedly shrank
in February. A euro-area composite index based on a survey of
purchasing managers in both industries dropped to 49.7 from 50.4
in January, London-based Markit Economics said in an initial
estimate today.  In China, the preliminary 49.7 reading of a manufacturing
index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit compared with a final
48.8 in January.  China is cutting banks’ reserve requirements from Feb. 24
to support an economic expansion that Nomura Holdings Inc.
estimates may be 7.5 percent this quarter, the least since the
global financial crisis. In today’s report, a measure of export
orders fell to an eight-month low.  The  median  forecast in a Bloomberg News survey for January
existing-home sales called for a rise to 4.66 million. Estimates
of the 74 economists surveyed ranged from 4.4 million to 4.91
million after a previously reported 4.61 million pace in
December.  Last Year  Existing-home sales, tabulated when a contract closes,
climbed to 4.26 million last year from 4.19 million in 2010.
Demand peaked at 7.1 million in 2005 during the housing boom. In
2008, sales totaled 4.1 million, the least since 1995.  The number of previously owned homes on the market dropped
to 2.31 million, the fewest since March 2005. At the current
sales pace, it would take 6.1 months to sell those houses, the
lowest since April 2006, down from 6.4 months in December.  The median price of a previously-owned home fell 2 percent
to $154,700 from $157,900 in January 2011, today’s report
showed. The median price dropped to $166,100 last year, the
lowest since 2002, from $172,900 in 2010.  Single-Family Homes  Sales of existing single-family homes increased 3.8 percent
to an annual rate of 4.05 million. Purchases of multifamily
properties, including condominiums and townhouses, rose 8.3
percent to a 520,000 pace.  Purchases rose in all four U.S. regions, led by gains of
8.8 percent in the West and 3.5 percent in the South.  The fourth-warmest January on record may have helped bring
out homebuyers. The  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration  reported the average temperature was 36.3 degrees
Fahrenheit (2.39 degrees Celsius), 5.5 degrees above the 1901-
2000 long-term average.  The favorable conditions helped spark  Home Depot Inc. (HD) ’s
biggest sales gain since the first quarter of 2004. The world’s
largest home-improvement retailer said yesterday that receipts
at stores open at least a year climbed 5.7 percent in the three
months ended Jan. 29. Net income increased 32 percent, the
Atlanta-based company said.  Today’s housing report showed contract cancellations were
reported by 33 percent of the group’s members in January, the
same as a month earlier.  Labor Market  One asset for the market has been the improvement in
employment. The jobless rate fell in January to a three-year low
of 8.3 percent, and payrolls rose by 243,000 workers. Employment
growth has accelerated in each of the past three months.  Greater affordability is also supporting home demand. The
Realtors group’s  measure  of whether households earning the
median income can afford a median-priced house at current
 interest rates  reached record levels in the last three months of
2011.  Policy makers are working to help distressed homeowners.
The top five mortgage lenders this month reached a $25 billion
settlement with 49 states and the U.S. government over the use
of faulty paperwork in foreclosures.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central
bank’s efforts to spur growth are being blunted by impediments
to mortgage lending, and he called for more steps to heal the
housing industry.  “The economic recovery has been disappointing in part
because U.S. housing markets remain out of balance,” Bernanke
told homebuilders on Feb. 10 in  Orlando ,  Florida . “We need to
continue to develop and implement policies that will help the
housing sector get back on its feet.”  The foreclosure crisis is unlikely to subside any time
soon. Owners of more than 14 million homes are in foreclosure,
behind on their mortgages or owe more than their properties are
worth, said RealtyTrac Inc., a property-data company in  Irvine ,
 California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
