MGM Resorts International (MGM) , the
biggest casino operator on the Las Vegas Strip, reported a
narrower fourth-quarter loss as  Nevada ’s gambling recovery
picked up and convention business improved.  The net loss of $113.7 million, or 23 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $139.2 million, or 29 cents, a year
earlier, Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts said today in a  statement .
Excluding items, the loss was 21 cents, compared with the 20-
cent average loss of 17  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  MGM Resorts, recovering from several years of gambling and
convention declines, cited better conference business and
improving trends on the Strip, where industry casino revenue
rose 5.1 percent last year. The industrywide jump was the
second-straight annual gain and the biggest since 2006. MGM also
cited strong growth overseas.  “The revenue growth on the convention side led this
recovery,” MGM Chief Executive Officer Jim Murren said on a
conference  call  today. “The other aspects of our business are
catching up. Gaming is coming back in  Las Vegas .”  Revenue rose 56 percent to $2.3 billion in the fourth
quarter, boosted by the acquisition of a majority interest in
MGM  China , owner of the MGM Macau resort and casino. Analysts
projected $2.21 billion on average.  Absent Builders  While Las Vegas room revenue will probably only rise by 2
percent to 3 percent in the first quarter, those numbers should
increase at a mid-to-high single percentage rate for all of 2012
as MGM draws leisure travelers to boxing matches and concerts,
Murren said on the conference call.  First-quarter room-revenue numbers will suffer the absence
of a construction-industry convention held last year that will
not return this quarter, Murren said in a telephone interview.  “Year-over-year will be up nicely on conventions in number
of rooms and rates,” he said.  At MGM Resorts’ wholly-owned U.S. properties, adjusted
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
rose 18 percent to $319 million in the quarter. On the Strip,
hotel revenue increased 13 percent to $111 per room in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier.  On Feb. 17, the company’s 50 percent owned CityCenter
Holdings completed the sale of $240 million in aggregate
principal amount of 7.625 percent senior secured first lien
notes due 2016, according to a  regulatory filing . MGM Resorts
and partner Dubai World opened City Center in Las Vegas in
December 2009 after the $8.5 billion project skirted bankruptcy.  Total gambling revenue on the  Las Vegas Strip  was  $6.07
billion  last year, according to state data supplied by the Las
Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority. Industrywide, gambling
revenue  in Macau  rose 42 percent to $33.6 billion in 2011.  MGM Resorts fell 3  percent  to $13.77 at the close in  New
York . The shares have risen 32 percent this year.  (A replay of the MGM Resorts conference call will be
