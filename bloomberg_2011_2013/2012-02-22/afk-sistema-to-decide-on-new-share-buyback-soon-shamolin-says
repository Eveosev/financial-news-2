AFK Sistema (AFKS) , billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s holding company, will decide “soon” whether to
hold a new share buyback, according to Chief Executive Officer
Mikhail Shamolin.  “Last year the buyback was very successful, we earned
about 30 percent,” Shamolin said in an interview in Moscow Feb.
17. “We are discussing the question of a new buyback. The
discount is still quite large. We believe there shouldn’t be one
and that it will decrease.”  Sistema completed a buyback of shares and global depositary
receipts in November. The company purchased 376,000 receipts at
$16.61 apiece and 8.75 million shares at 20.97 rubles each.
Sistema’s stock may climb 20 percent by the end of the year if
markets remain stable, said Shamolin, who took up his current
post last March after stepping down as head of OAO Mobile
TeleSystems, a Sistema unit. He declined to comment on whether
the buyback would include MTS shares.  Sistema added 0.3 percent to 26.552 rubles as of 4:26 p.m.
in Moscow. The GDRs slid 1.3 percent to $19.92. One depositary
receipt is equal to 20 ordinary shares.  The shares and depositary receipts currently trade at a
discount of 40 percent to 50 percent to their fair price,
Shamolin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
