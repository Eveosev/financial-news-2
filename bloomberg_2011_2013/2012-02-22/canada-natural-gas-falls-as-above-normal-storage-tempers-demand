Canadian natural gas fell as a glut
of the fuel in U.S. storage pared the need for imports.  Alberta  gas dropped 1.1 percent. Inventories probably
declined 171 billion cubic feet in the week ended Feb. 17, the
median of 19 analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) . That would
leave 2.59 trillion cubic feet of gas in storage, 40 percent
more than the  five-year average .  “The weather is so warm and there’s so much gas in storage
it’s hard to get bullish,” said Carl Neill, a consultant with
Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “The only way prices are going
up is through more production cuts.”  Encana Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. have said they
plan to cut output because of low gas prices. The number of rigs
drilling for gas in the U.S. slipped last week to 716, the
lowest level since Oct. 2, 2009, according to data compiled by
Baker Hughes Inc.  Alberta gas for March delivery declined 2.25 cents to
C$2.0525 a gigajoule ($1.95 per million British thermal units)
at 4 p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX
gas has dropped 29 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 1.7 cents to settle at $2.643 per million Btu.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
0.76 cent to $2.7057 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas declined 0.58 cent to $2.5102. At Malin,  Oregon ,
where Canadian gas is traded for California markets, gas was
down 0.25 cent to $2.6151.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.8 billion cubic
feet, 30 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.63 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.12 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 565 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.88 billion cubic feet today, or 77 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.05
billion cubic feet at 2:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
