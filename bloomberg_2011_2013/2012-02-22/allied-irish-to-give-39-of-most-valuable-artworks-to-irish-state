  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , the bailed
out Irish lender, said it is donating 39 of its most valuable
artworks to the Irish state.  A dozen of the works will be transferred to the state
immediately with the remainder being donated over the next two
years to make the art “more accessible to the Irish public,”
the Dublin-based lender said today in an e-mailed statement. No
value was given for the collection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
