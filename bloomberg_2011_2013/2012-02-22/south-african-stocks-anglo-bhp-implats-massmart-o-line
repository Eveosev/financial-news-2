The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
fell for the first time in four days, declining 0.4 percent to
34,006.52 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active equities in the
South African market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , a diversified miner that makes
up about 9 percent of the index, slipped 1.4 percent to 325.10
rand. Copper for May delivery declined 0.9 percent to $3.809 a

declined 0.7 percent to 252 rand.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the second-biggest

percent less than usual at its largest mine, which remains
closed after an illegal strike, the company said.  “It’s an absolute guess, because it’s too early to know,”
Derek Engelbrech, Johannesburg-based Impala’s marketing
executive, said by mobile phone today.  The company may also lose more than 100,000 ounces of
