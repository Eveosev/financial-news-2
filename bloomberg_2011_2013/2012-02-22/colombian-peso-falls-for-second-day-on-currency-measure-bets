Colombia ’s peso fell for a second
day on speculation the central bank will take further measures
to ease gains in the local currency.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 1,782.01 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,778.35 yesterday. It touched 1,770 on Feb. 9, its
strongest intraday level since August. The peso has jumped 7.7
percent in the last three months, the third-best performance
after the  Mexican peso  and South African rand among 25 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Concern about global growth also reduced demand today for
higher-yielding assets, including the Colombian peso, according
to Juan Camilo Santana, an analyst at Cia. de Profesionales de
Bolsa SA brokerage in Bogota.  “The market is awaiting what comes out of the central
bank’s meeting” on Feb. 24, said Santana. “If they do raise
 interest rates , some are predicting other measures to help stem
the peso’s rally.”  The central bank began on Feb. 6 to buy a minimum of $20
million daily in the  currency market , which is scheduled to
continue for at least three months.  Banco de la Republica will raise its overnight lending rate
a quarter percentage point to 5.25 percent in this week’s
meeting, according to 14 of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Eleven analysts estimate the rate will remain unchanged at 5
percent.  European services and manufacturing output shrank in
February as the euro-area economy struggled to rebound from a
contraction in the fourth quarter. A separate report showed
Chinese manufacturing may shrink a fourth straight month in
February.  Bond Yields Drop  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
7.38 percent, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.243 centavo to 120.749 centavos per peso.  Yields on Colombian peso bonds due August 2026 fell to 7.61
percent at a government auction of fixed-rate securities today,
from 7.62 percent at the last auction on Feb. 8. Colombia also
sold debt due October 2018 to yield 6.93 percent, up from 6.89
percent in the previous auction, while the yield on the October
2015 securities rose to 6.6 percent from 6.42 percent, the
 Finance Ministry  said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
