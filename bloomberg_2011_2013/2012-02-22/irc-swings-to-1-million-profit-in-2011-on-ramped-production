IRC Ltd. (1029) , the Hong Kong-listed
company mining iron ore in Far East Russia, swung to a profit in
its first full year of production as its Kuranakh mine reaches
full capacity.  Net income rose to $1 million in the year ended Dec. 31
from a loss of $82 million a year earlier, IRC said today. Sales
increased fourfold to $122.2 million.  IRC, an affiliate of gold miner  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , said
last month it beat its output target by 6.7 percent for iron ore
concentrate and ilmenite, the material used to make paint
pigment. It’s aiming to produce 4.5 million tons of iron ore in
2014 after starting its flagship K&S mine, located in  Russia , 60
kilometers (37 miles) from the Chinese border.  “We are achieving good prices,” Executive Jay Hambro said
by phone. “The more we produce, the more power we have. That
means we start making savings with transport and our unit costs
go down.”  IRC, which in 2010 became the second company from Russia to
list in  Hong Kong , produced 800,291 metric tons of iron ore
concentrate and 63,490 tons in 2011, the company said Jan. 12.
The company is planning to double ilmenite production to 125,000
tons, it said today.  “We have not seen any slowdown in our demand,” Hambro
said. Demand from India may play in to support iron prices, he
said. “ India  remains a small exporter but over the next 18 to
36 months, it will become a net importer. There would be quite
an influence on the price.”  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
