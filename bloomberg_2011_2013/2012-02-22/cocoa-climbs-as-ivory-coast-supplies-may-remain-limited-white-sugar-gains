Arabica-coffee futures fell the most
in a week as stockpiles climbed and producers sought to increase
sales in  Brazil , the world’s top grower. Sugar and cocoa rose.  Coffee  inventories  monitored by ICE Futures U.S. have
jumped 24 percent since the end of October, exchange data show.
As of Feb. 17, Brazil’s permits for exports this month surged 26
percent from January, the nation’s Council of Coffee Exporters,
known as  Cecafe , said on its website. Markets in the country
were closed on Feb. 20 and 21 for the Carnival festival.  “Brazilian sellers are back in the market,” Hernando de la Roche, the director of futures at INTL FCStone in Miami, said
in a telephone interview. “Stocks are also rising.”  On ICE, arabica-coffee futures for May delivery declined 2
percent to settle at $2.0185 a pound at 2 p.m., the biggest drop
since Feb. 14. The price has tumbled 11 percent this year.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery rose 1 percent to 24.71
cents a pound in  New York . The sweetener has gained 6.1 percent
in 2012, after plunging 27 percent last year.  As of Feb. 1, sugar output in Brazil’s Center South, the
world’s largest growing-region, fell 6.8 percent for the season
that ends March 31 from a year earlier, Unica, an industry
group, said last week.  There is “growing doubt” that the crop in Brazil, the
biggest producer, can increase, supporting prices,  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at Newedge Group in New York,
said in an e-mailed report.  Cocoa futures for May delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$2,438 a metric ton on ICE, after touching $2,454, the highest
since Jan. 27. The price has jumped 16 percent this year.  In London futures trading, robusta coffee dropped, while
refined sugar and cocoa advanced on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
