Billionaire Philip Falcone’s
LightSquared Inc. wireless venture is cutting 45 percent of its
jobs, or about 149 positions, to preserve cash after its plan to
start operating was rejected by U.S. regulators.  Most of the affected employees are those hired in
preparation for its high-speed wireless network expansion,
Reston, Virginia-based LightSquared said today. The company has
330 workers in total.  LightSquared said it is seeking to reduce costs while it
works to resolve the regulatory objections. The Federal
Communications Commission said last week that it won’t let
LightSquared begin service after an Obama administration adviser
found that it disrupts navigation gear used by planes, boats and
autos.  Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners hedge fund has
invested about $3 billion in closely held LightSquared, which
seeks to compete against  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  Verizon Wireless  to offer
service that lets users browse the Web at higher speeds.  This week, LightSquared skipped a $56.3 million payment to
its partner  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT) , a British satellite operator, saying
unspecified obligations weren’t met.  To contact the reporter on this story:
