Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  will pay about $280
million for a stake in nine of  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) ’s Papua New
Guinea onshore natural-gas licenses, with the potential to
export the liquefied fuel to Japan.  The joint venture may be capable of exporting 3 million
tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year, Calgary-based Talisman
said in a statement today. Papua New Guinea is “a vast and
under-explored country with huge LNG supply potential within the
Asia-Pacific region,” according to the statement.  Talisman will own about 40 percent and Tokyo-based
Mitsubishi about 20 percent of the licenses. Holders of the
remaining stake weren’t identified.  Talisman, which has licenses to explore about 13.7 million
acres in Papua New Guinea,  rose  3 percent to C$14.26 at the
close in Toronto. Mitsubishi rose 0.6 percent to 1,998 yen at
the close in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
