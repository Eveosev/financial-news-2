Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO) , Colombia’s
biggest publicly-traded retailer, will invest as much as $200
million in its 2012 expansion that will focus on opening stores
in low-income areas and express shops in urban areas, said Chief
Executive Officer Gonzalo Restrepo.  The company will use funds it already has, including from
last year’s $1.4 billion share sale, to pay for the expansion,
Restrepo said in a conference call with reporters today. Stores
acquired in  Uruguay  last year contributed positively to the
company’s fourth-quarter earnings, he said, without giving
further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
