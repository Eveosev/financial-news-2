Schneider Electric SA (SU) , the biggest
maker of low- and medium-voltage equipment, aims to reap as much
as 1.1 billion euros ($1.46 billion) in savings by the end of
2014 after reporting 2011 earnings that beat estimates.  Reductions will come from equipment costs, better execution
of projects and being more selective on projects, Schneider said
in a statement today. Schneider advanced as  much as 8.3 percent
in Paris trading, the most since Nov. 28.  Chief Executive Officer Jean-Pascal Tricoire, who spent
$3.8 billion last year to expand in  emerging markets  and broaden
power-management systems, is paring costs after cutting
Schneider’s margin outlook twice last year. Tricoire today
predicted “flat to slightly positive” organic sales growth and
said Western Europe damping expansion.  “While we see continued strength in new economies and
opportunities from a recovering  North America , Western Europe is
expected to weigh on growth” in 2012, Tricoire said.  Schneider gained as much as 3.97 euros to 51.81 euros in
Paris, and traded at 50.58 euros as of 10:44 a.m. Schneider will
pay a  dividend  of 1.70 euros this year, up from 1.60 euros last
year. The company said it will keep a payout ratio of 50 percent
of net income through 2014.  Rising Profit  Net income climbed 6 percent to 1.82 billion euros in 2011,
beating analyst  estimates  of 1.79 billion euros. Sales advanced
14 percent to 22.39 billion euros.  Raw-material inflation added 437 million euros to
Schneider’s costs last year, while price increases added 241
million euros in revenue. The carry-over effect of price
increases introduced in 2011 may add 100 million euros to 150
million euros in revenue this year, Chief Financial Officer
Emmanuel Babeau said.  Schneider predicted an adjusted margin on earnings before
interest, taxes, and amortization before restructuring costs and
other items 14 percent to 15 percent in 2012, after 14.4 percent
in 2011 and 15 percent in 2010. A “more selective” approach to
services and energy-management projects will “temporarily
impact” solutions revenue growth, while “significantly”
lifting profitability, it said.  Solutions made up 37 percent of Schneider’s revenue, up
from 30 percent in 2008. Schneider said it plans to boost the
business’s adjusted Ebita margin, which stood at 9 percent in
2011, by at least 2 percentage points by 2014  The uncertain economic outlook will require restraint in
terms of acquisitions “at least in the first half of the
year,” Babeau told reporters in Paris. Schneider will focus on
integrating recent purchases, and the company continues to
prefer small and medium-sized acquisitions, as it seeks to
maintain  credit rating  in a range of A- and BBB+, he said.  Last year’s takeovers included Spanish software company
 Telvent GIT SA (TLVTF) , Chinese energy-savings drives maker Leader
Harvest Power Technologies, and Indian maker of inverters and
power-storage systems Luminous Power Technologies. Schneider
also bought  Areva SA (AREVA) ’s power-distribution unit in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
