Bahrain Telecommunications Co. (BATELCO) , the
state-controlled company known as Batelco, said its profit this
year will probably show a double-digit percentage increase
helped by a one-time gain on the sale of its Indian unit STel.  Batelco forecast a “low single digit” decline in full
year revenue. Increasing competition in Bahrain is putting
pressure on margins, the company said today in a presentation.  The dividend payment will be consistent with previous
years, it added. The company paid a cash dividend of $152.8
million last year, representing a 72 percent payout at the value
of 40 fils per share.  Batelco announced Feb. 8 selling its 42.7 percent stake in
STel Private Ltd., a mobile operator in  India , for $174.5
million, after the nation’s top court canceled licenses in a
corruption probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
