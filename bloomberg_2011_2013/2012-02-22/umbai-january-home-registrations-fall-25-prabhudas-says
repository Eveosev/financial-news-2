Mumbai’s January home sales
registrations slid 25 percent from December, according to
Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt.  Registrations declined to 4,427 units, the Mumbai-based
brokerage said in a report yesterday. They stayed at 4,000 to
4,500 levels from June to November. Sales slid 13 percent from a
year earlier, while lease volumes rose 10 percent from a year
ago to 9,111 units, according to the report.  Property demand has slumped in the nation’s biggest cities
as the  Reserve Bank  of  India   raised  borrowing costs by a record
375 basis points since March 2010 to slow inflation even as
property prices remained close to record highs.  “A number of projects which were stuck at the approval
stage in the last year are likely to be cleared, paving the way
for a large number of launches hitting the market,” Kejal Mehta,
an analyst at the brokerage, said in the report. A large stock
of new supply may act as “the trigger for the much anticipated
price reduction that buyers have been waiting for,” she added.  Registration data is a lagging indicator of demand as
properties are registered two to three months after the actual
purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
