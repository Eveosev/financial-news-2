Chile ’s peso weakened, snapping a
four-day winning streak, after lower-than-forecast economic data
from Europe and  China  pushed commodity prices lower and stifled
demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 482.4 per  U.S. dollar  at 9:46
a.m. in Santiago, from 481.5 yesterday.  “Bad numbers from Europe are hitting the euro, and data
from China is affecting commodity prices,” Cristian Donoso, a
trader at Banco de Chile, said in a phone interview.  A purchasing-managers index of euro-area services and
manufacturing dropped to 49.7, London-based Markit Economics
said, below the 50.5 median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Also, a preliminary indicator from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics signaled that Chinese manufacturing
activity may shrink for a fourth straight month.  The price of copper, Chile’s main export, retreated as much
as 1 percent in  New York  and European stocks fell. The euro
weakened as much as 0.2 percent.  A central bank survey today said that Chilean traders and
investors forecast the monetary authority will keep its key
 interest rate  at 5 percent in March as inflation estimates
increase. Traders also raised their 12-month annual inflation
forecast to 3.2 percent from 3.09 percent on Feb. 7.  Donoso said that he would seek to sell pesos if the
currency moved near 480 or 481 per dollar and buy pesos if it
moved to 485 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
