Yuan forwards declined for a second
straight day as the central bank lowered the currency’s
reference rate and a report showed  China ’s manufacturing may
shrink for a fourth month in February.  The People’s Bank of China set the rate 0.04 percent weaker
at 6.2988 per dollar. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index
retreated on concern a 130 billion euro ($172 billion) bailout
for  Greece  that euro-area finance ministers approved yesterday
won’t end  Europe ’s debt crisis. The preliminary reading on
China’s manufacturing is 49.7 in February, according to an index
by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today. A number below
50 points to a contraction.  “There’s mild risk-aversion dynamics developing, and the
dollar is strengthening” against Asian currencies, said  Robert Minikin , a strategist at Standard Chartered Plc. in Hong Kong.
“That is spilling over to the yuan market as well. But the
moves are very shallow.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped to 6.2835 per
dollar as of 4:39 p.m. in  Hong Kong , from yesterday’s 6.2827,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The forwards were at a
0.2 percent premium to the onshore spot rate. The contracts fell
as much as 0.11 percent earlier.  The yuan closed at 6.2960 per dollar in Shanghai, from
yesterday’s 6.2960, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency is allowed to trade 0.5 percent on
either side of the daily fixing. In Hong Kong’s offshore market,
the yuan gained 0.02 percent to 6.2907.  To contact the reporters on this story:
