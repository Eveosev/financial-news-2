A court granted a request from real
estate investors Vincent and  Robert Tchenguiz  for a review of
their arrests following an investigation by the U.K.’s Serious
Fraud Office.  A court will hear arguments in May from the Tchenguiz
brothers that their detentions in March 2011 were “unlawful,”
Robert Tchenguiz said in an e-mailed statement.  “I am confident that in due course the court will find in
my favor and will vindicate the view which I expressed at the
time” that the SFO’s actions “were unlawfully
disproportionate,” he said.  The Tchenguiz brothers were arrested, and later released
without charge, following an SFO investigation into the collapse
of Iceland’s Kaupthing Bank Hf. They were among seven men
arrested in  London , and two in Reykjavik, Iceland, after two
businesses and eight residences were searched.  David Jones , a spokesman for the SFO, said the agency
didn’t challenge the brothers’ request.  -- Editor: Christopher Scinta  To contact the reporter on this story:
