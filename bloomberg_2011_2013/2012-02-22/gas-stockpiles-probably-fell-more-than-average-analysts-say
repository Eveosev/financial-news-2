U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
fell more than the five-year average last week as prices near
10-year lows boosted demand for the heating and power-plant
fuel, analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH)  show.  Inventories dropped 170 billion cubic feet, or 6.2 percent,
to 2.591 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Feb. 17, based on
the median of 18 estimates. The five-year average decline for
the week is 145 billion, according to the Energy Department,
which is scheduled to release its weekly supply report tomorrow.  A stockpile surplus in the week ended Feb. 10 rose to 765
billion cubic feet, 38 percent above the five-year average, last
week’s report showed.  “Gas is moving a lot of coal out, possibly as much as 5
billion or 6 billion cubic feet a day,” said Ron Denhardt, vice
president of natural gas services at Strategic Energy & Economic
Research Inc. in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “With this warm
weather it needs to move more.”  Low-priced gas will displace coal in  power plants  in the
central and western U.S. this year,  Barclays Capital  said
yesterday.  Switching from coal to gas usually occurs at electric
generating plants in the eastern U.S., where coal prices are
highest, Shiyang Wang, an analyst for Barclays in New York, said
in a report to clients. Gas will displace coal in other regions
this year, Wang said.  The stockpile estimates ranged from declines of 125 billion
to 178 billion cubic feet. About 51 percent of U.S. households
use gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.  Demand for heat across the U.S. trailed normal by 7 percent
in the week ended Feb. 18, according to Belton, Missouri-based
forecaster Weather Derivatives. Demand in the Midwest was 18
percent below normal.  Natural gas rose 20.7 cents, or 8.4 percent, to $2.684 per
million British thermal units last week on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. The March-delivery contract today rose 1.7
cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $2.643. Prices have dropped
13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
