Austria’s government has granted as
much as 990 million euros ($13. billion) to the Institute of
Science and Technology between 2017 and 2026.  The Alpine republic will give the institute, which focuses
on basic research in the natural and mathematical sciences, 65.8
million euros a year and as much as 33.2 million euros if it
acquires third-party funds and reaches certain quality
parameters, according to a  statement  today. The Province of
Lower Austria, where IST is located, is also contributing 368
million euros.  The state and the province will already have provided IST
with 420 million euros by 2016, according to Austria Press
Agency. The institute currently consists of 20 research groups
and about 200 employees and is aiming to boost those numbers to
90 to 100 groups and 1,000 scientists by 2027, establishing
“IST Austria in the world-wide top level of research,” its
president, Professor Thomas Henzinger, said in the statement.  Since its establishment, IST has also managed to acquire 37
million euros in research funding and from private donors, the
Klosterneuburg-based institute said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
