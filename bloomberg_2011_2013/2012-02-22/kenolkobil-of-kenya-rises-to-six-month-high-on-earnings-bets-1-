KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC) , the Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, gained for a
fifth day and closed at its highest level in six months on
speculation it will report improved earnings next week.  The stock advanced 0.5 percent to 11.10 shillings at the
close in Nairobi, the capital. This is the strongest level since
Aug. 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is speculation that earnings will grow year-on-
year,” Gregory Waweru, a research analyst at Kestrel Capital
East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  The company is scheduled to report its annual results on
Feb. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
