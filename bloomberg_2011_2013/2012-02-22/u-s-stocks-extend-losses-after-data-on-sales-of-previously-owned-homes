U.S. stocks extended losses after
purchases of previously owned homes in January were below
economists’ forecasts.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent to
1,358.30 at 10:04 a.m. in  New York .  Purchases of previously owned U.S. houses climbed 4.3
percent to a 4.57 million annual rate, less than forecast, from
a revised 4.38 million pace in December that was slower than
estimated, a report from National Association of Realtors showed
today in Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey called for a rise to 4.66 million. Prices and inventory
fell.  Global stocks fell earlier as a gauge of European services
and manufacturing output unexpectedly shrank in February.
China’s manufacturing may shrink for a fourth month, according
to data from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
