The premiums for Light Louisiana
Sweet and Heavy Louisiana Sweet oils over the benchmark West
Texas Intermediate widened as the difference between WTI and
Brent increased.  Brent’s premium to WTI based on April futures contracts
widened $1.29 to $16.70 a barrel. When Brent increases versus
WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that
compete with West African oil priced against the European
benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI added 75 cents to
$18.25 a barrel as of 1:53 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet increased $1.25 to
a premium of $19.75.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI narrowed 75 cents to $17.25
and Mars Blend’s decreased 30 cents to $13.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium
was unchanged at $12.60 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN) ’s
premium added 50 cents to $14.50 over WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened $1 to $5 a barrel.
 Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  oil’s discount narrowed $2.25 at $13.25.  Western Canada
Select (USCSWCAS)  was unchanged at a discount of $28.50.  Bakken (USCSUHC1)  oil’s
spread was unchanged at $13 a barrel below WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
