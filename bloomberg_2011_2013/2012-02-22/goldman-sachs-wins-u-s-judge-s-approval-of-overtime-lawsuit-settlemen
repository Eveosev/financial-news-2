Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  won a
judge’s approval of a lawsuit settlement that will require the
bank to pay $993,841 to a group of computer technicians who said
they weren’t paid overtime for their work as contractors.  U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley in Manhattan today
entered a judgment approving the settlement, citing reasons he
stated at a Feb. 10 court conference.  In the lawsuit, the technicians said they deserved overtime
pay for working more than 40 hours a week. Work weeks topped 70
hours, and more than 100 employees in New York and New Jersey
were underpaid as a result, they said in a complaint filed in
May 2010.  David Wells , a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment
on the settlement.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs will be paid $262,787 plus
expenses, which will come from the settlement fund, Pauley said.  The case is Bardouille v. Goldman Sachs & Co., 10-cv-4285,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
