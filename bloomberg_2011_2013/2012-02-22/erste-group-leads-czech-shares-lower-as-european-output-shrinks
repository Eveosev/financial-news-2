Erste Group Banka AG (RBAG)  of Austria fell
for a second day, leading Czech shares lower after data showed
euro-area services and manufacturing output unexpectedly shrank.  Erste declined 1.5 percent to 468 koruna by 11:15 a.m. in
 Prague , extending a 0.7 percent retreat yesterday. The  PX (PX)  equity
gauge, where Erste has a 22 percent weighting, slid 0.4 percent.  European stocks and commodities fell after a gauge of the
regionâ€™s services and manufacturing production dropped to 49.7,
according to London-based Markit Economics. That was below the
forecast of 50.5 by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
