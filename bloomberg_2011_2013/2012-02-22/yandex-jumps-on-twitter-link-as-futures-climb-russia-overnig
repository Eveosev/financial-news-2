Yandex NV (YNDX)  surged to a three-month
high in the U.S. as a deal to make Twitter Inc.’s feed available
to users of  Russia ’s most popular search engine bolstered the
outlook for the company.  Yandex jumped 6.8 percent in  New York  yesterday, the
biggest gainer on the  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 index  of Russian
companies traded in the U.S., which fell 0.2 percent to 108.92.
Volumes for the Internet stock were the most since Jan. 26.
 Futures expiring in March  on the dollar-denominated  RTS  Index
added 0.2 percent to 165,340 in U.S. trading.  The  Internet company , which has its chief share listing on
the Nasdaq Composite Index, will make the full “tweet” feed
available on the site as it focuses on boosting social-
networking search capabilities, Yandex and Twitter said
yesterday. Yandex will probably report fourth-quarter adjusted
 net income  of 2.1 billion rubles ($71 million) today, from 1.7
billion rubles in the third quarter, according to the median of
three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Partnership with a social media leader like Twitter is
certainly positive for Yandex as it may provide a social media
offering that it currently lacks,” Ilya Kravets, a research
analyst at ED Capital in New York, which manages almost $100
million in assets, said by phone yesterday. “If Twitter is
integrated into the Yandex platform, it may create a unique
product.”  Russian stock futures and energy producers including  OAO
Gazprom (OGZPY)  and  OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY)  gained yesterday as oil, which
along with sales of natural gas provided almost 50 percent of
Russian government revenue last year, rose to a nine-month high.  Iran Sales  Crude for March delivery added 2.5 percent to $105.84 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since May 4. Commodities advanced as euro-area
finance ministers agreed on a second bailout for  Greece  and  Iran 
said it stopped selling oil to  France  and Britain.  Brent oil for April settlement increased 1.3 percent to
$121.66 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export blend, gained 0.5
percent to $121.14.  American depositary receipts of Gazprom, the world’s
biggest natural gas producer, rose 0.2 percent to $12.68 in New
York. U.S. markets were closed for a holiday on Feb. 20.
Gazprom’s shares on Moscow’s  Micex (INDEXCF)  Index tumbled 1.2 percent
yesterday to 188.67 rubles, or the equivalent of $6.34. One ADR
equals two ordinary shares.  Surgutneftegas ADRs rose 0.8 percent to $6.45, while its
 shares  in Moscow fell 0.9 percent to 19.09 rubles, or 64 U.S.
cents. One ADR equals ten ordinary shares.  ‘Market Euphoria’  “It’s a day of market euphoria because of the agreement on
Greece, it doesn’t resolve the situation, it gives them a little
more time, helping this strong rally in risk assets,”  Ian McCall , a managing partner at Quesnell Capital SA, an emerging
markets investment adviser in Geneva that manages 100 million
Swiss francs ($108 million) including Russian assets, said by
phone yesterday. “Oil is high. That is also good news for
Russian assets.”  Yandex surged the most since Nov. 3 to close at $23.57 in
New York yesterday, the highest level since Nov. 15, bringing
its advance for the year to 20 percent. The stock slid 49
percent from a May initial public offering last year, outpacing
the 28 percent 2011 decline in global depositary receipts traded
in  London  of competitor  Mail.ru Group (MAIL) , the largest Russian-
language Internet company.  Volumes Surge  Trading volumes for Yandex totaled more than $4.9 million
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s more than
twice the stock’s daily average and the most of any U.S.-traded
Russian stock yesterday, according to Luis Saenz, chief
executive officer of the U.S. unit of Moscow-based brokerage
Otkritie Financial Corp.  Call options  to buy stock of Yandex were 3.8 times the
four-week average yesterday and twice the average volume of puts
to sell, data compiled by Bloomberg show. March $25 calls, with
a strike 6.1 percent above yesterday’s close, were the most
active options, changing hands 1,081 times, the data show.  Russia’s advertising market, excluding political ads, grew
21 percent to 263.4 billion rubles ($8.9 billion) in 2011 from
2010, exceeding the amount spent by advertisers in 2008 for the
first time since the global financial crisis, the  Association of
Communication Agencies of Russia  said in a report released
yesterday.  Internet ad spending grew the most, expanding 56 percent,
the data showed. Advertising is the main source of revenue for
Yandex.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, slid 0.5 percent to $31.71, snapping a
three-day jump. The  RTS Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures
expected swings in the index futures, declined 0.6 percent to
31.51. The RTS in Moscow was little changed at 1,655.36
yesterday, while the 30-stock Micex fell 1.3 percent to
1,558.98.  To contact the reporter on this story:
