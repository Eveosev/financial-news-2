Indonesia ’s rupiah declined for a
second straight day as concern a bailout package for Greece may
not be enough to avert a default deterred investors from buying
emerging-market assets. Government bonds were steady.  The Jakarta Composite Index of shares dropped 0.2 percent
after economists from Citigroup Inc. and Commerzbank AG warned
yesterday that Greece may fail to meet the terms of its 130
billion euro ($172 billion) second bailout amid a fifth year of
recession, looming elections and social unrest. The rupiah has
dropped 0.7 percent this month as exchange data showed global
funds sold $143 million more local stocks than they bought
through yesterday.  “The euphoria from the Greece deal yesterday has given way
to a waiting game,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “Whether or not the
solution will be sustainable in the long run has yet to be
seen.”  The rupiah fell 0.1 percent to 9,059 per dollar as of 9:30
a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds was
little changed at 5.27 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
