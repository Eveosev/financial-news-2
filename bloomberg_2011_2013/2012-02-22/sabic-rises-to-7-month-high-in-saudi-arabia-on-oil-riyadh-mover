Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the
world’s biggest petrochemicals maker, rallied to the highest in
almost seven months on bets rising oil prices will support the
stock and as  Saudi Arabia ’s benchmark index surged to the
highest since 2008.  The shares advanced 1.3 percent to 100.5 riyals, the
highest since Aug. 3, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The
stock was the  most active  by trading value in the  Tadawul All
Share Index, (SASEIDX)  which climbed 0.9 percent to 7,031.26, the highest
since September 2008. The stock has advanced 4.4 percent  so far
this year  compared with a 9.6 percent gain in the benchmark.  “Sabic is trading above 100 riyals on the strength in
Brent prices,” said Dubai-based Ibrahim Masood, who helps
manage about $400 million at  Mashreqbank PSC. (MASQ)  “The stock has
seen significantly higher volumes over the past couple of days
as offshore investors tried to play catchup with the Saudi
market.”  Sabic in January posted a  35 percent rise  in full-year
profit. Chief Executive Officer Mohamed al-Mady said that month
he expects prices and demand for petrochemicals to improve
toward the end of 2012. Brent crude futures have gained 14
percent this year as the European Union and U.S. imposed
sanctions on Iran, prompting the Middle East’s second-biggest
producer to halt oil exports to France and the U.K.  Speculation that oil supplies will be disrupted has
increased as tension between Iran and Western nations escalates,
 David Greely , head of energy research at  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  in New York, said in a report today. The bank maintained a
recommendation that investors buy Brent contracts for July 2012
to take advantage of rising prices.  Sabic lost 8.1 percent in 2011, compared with a 3.1 percent
drop in the Saudi Tadawul Index. Fourteen analysts recommend
investors buy Sabic shares, while three have a hold rating on
the stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
