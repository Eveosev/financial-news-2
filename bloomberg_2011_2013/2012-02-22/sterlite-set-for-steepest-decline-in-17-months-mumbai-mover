Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) ,
controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, was set for the steepest
decline in 17 months in Mumbai as investors awaited details on
the reported merger with group company  Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA)   Sterlite shares declined as much as 7.6 percent, the most
since Sept. 29, 2010, to 118.60 rupees and traded at 119 rupees
as of 2:42 p.m. local time. Sesa shares fell as much as 5
percent to 234.5 rupees and were at 240.85 rupees. The benchmark
BSE India Sensitive Index dropped 1.2 percent.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , parent of Sterlite and Sesa, said
yesterday in a statement its strategy is to simplify and
consolidate its corporate structure and it reviews such options
on an “ongoing basis.” The statement came after  India ’s CNBC-
TV18 moneycontrol.com website reported yesterday Vedanta is
seeking to combine Sterlite and Sesa. The share swap ratio may
be 2:3, the Business Standard reported today.  “There’s uncertainty about the kind of restructuring the
group is planning and investors may book profits before taking a
fresh view on the stock,” said Bhavesh Chauhan, an analyst at
Angel Broking Ltd. in Mumbai. “Sterlite has a complicated
business structure and while it may make sense to simplify it,
we can’t say which company will gain from such restructuring
based on news reports.” Chauhan has a “buy” rating for
Sterlite.  Sesa Managing Director Prasun Kumar Mukherjee declined to
comment on the news reports.  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , which Vedanta bought in December after
paying $8.67 billion for 58.5 percent of the company, including
20 percent held by Sesa, may also be combined with the new
entity, Business Standard reported. Sterlite would become the
holding company for Vedanta’s Indian operations, according to
the CNBC-TV18 report.  Sesa Goa is 46.2 percent owned by Finsider International
Co., a unit of Vedanta Resources, while Twin Star Holdings Ltd.,
another Vedanta unit, holds 49.73 percent in Sterlite, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
