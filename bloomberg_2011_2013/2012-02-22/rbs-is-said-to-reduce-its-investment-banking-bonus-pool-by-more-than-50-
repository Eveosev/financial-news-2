Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s second-biggest government-owned lender, will cut
bonuses for investment bankers by more than half, a person
familiar with the matter said.  RBS (RBS)  will set aside about 400 million pounds ($623 million)
for bonuses at its securities unit for last year, compared with
about 950 million pounds in 2010, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the details are not public. Britain’s
Prime Minister  David Cameron  said last month that individual
discretionary cash payments at state-controlled RBS and  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  would be limited to 2,000 pounds.  RBS Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester , 51, said last
month he would waive his 963,000-pound bonus for 2011 after the
U.K.’s opposition Labour Party sought a Parliamentary vote on
the award. Chairman Philip Hampton waived his 1.4 million-pound
stock award, and the British government is pressing for other
board members also decide to forgo their bonuses, a person
familiar with ministers’ thinking said last month. RBS reports
full-year earnings tomorrow.  The government was forced to rescue RBS at the height of
the financial crisis, injecting 45.5 billion pounds of taxpayer
money into the lender, making it the costliest bailout of any
bank in the world. Hester said in an e-mail sent to staff this
month that the cost of cleaning up the 82 percent government-
owned bank, inherited from former CEO  Fred Goodwin , totals 38
billion pounds so far. Hester has cut the Edinburgh-based
lender’s assets by about 600 billion pounds to 1.6 trillion
pounds since replacing Goodwin in 2008.  Sky News reported the bonus payment earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
