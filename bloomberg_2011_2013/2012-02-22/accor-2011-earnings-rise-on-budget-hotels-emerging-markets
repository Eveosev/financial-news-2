Accor SA (AC) ,  Europe ’s biggest hotel
company, reported a 19 percent gain in full-year profit and said
fourth-quarter business patterns continued into January, boosted
by growth in budget lodgings and  emerging markets .  Earnings before interest and tax rose to 530 million euros
($702 million) from 446 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-
based company said today in a statement. Profit was at the top
end of Accor’s forecast of 510 million to 530 million euros and
beat the 523.7 million-euro average of 17 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  The hotelier, which generates about three-quarters of
 revenue  in Europe, is renovating economy lodges and combining
them under the Ibis brand to win travelers. By selling freeholds
and signing agreements to operate or franchise most of the
properties, Accor reduced net debt by about two-thirds last year
while adding a record 38,700 rooms.  “Despite the uncertain economic environment, business is
holding firm,” Accor said. The hotelier said it sees growth
opportunities in  Asia  and  Latin America  and expects to benefit
this year from events including the London Olympics, European
soccer finals in  Poland  and trade fairs in  Germany .  Stock Rises  Accor  rose  as much as 5.9 percent and was up 4.6 percent at
27.40 euros as of 11:34 a.m. in Paris, the highest price since
Aug. 4. The shares have jumped 40 percent this year, the
steepest gain among the 21 members of the  Stoxx 600
Travel/Leisure Index, (SXTP)  which has climbed 6.8 percent.  Growth in 2012 will be mainly from existing operations,
though Accor doesn’t rule out acquisitions, Chief Executive
Officer  Denis Hennequin  told journalists on a conference call.  The hotelier said it “amply” exceeded its expansion
target of 35,000 new rooms in 2011, and reiterated an aim to add
a further 40,000 rooms this year. The Asia-Pacific region will
represent about “45 percent of Accor’s pipeline of
development” in 2012, Hennequin said.  Accor will also pursue its brand strategy in 2012,
including re-branding the Ibis chain and expanding luxury
divisions that include the Pullman and Sofitel brands. Accor
plans to double the Pullman network by 2015, Hennequin said.  ‘Excellent Financial Health’  The company will pay shareholders a  dividend  of 1.15 euros
a share, including a special payment of 50 cents a share, which
it said reflects “excellent financial health.”  Net debt  was 226 million euros at the end of last year,
down from 730 million euros in 2010. Hennequin said in October
that Accor would end 2011 with almost no borrowings.  “The main surprise is the strength of the dividend,”
Simon Champion, a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG,
wrote in a report today.  The hotelier doesn’t exclude a sale of its North American
Motel 6 brand as it continues restructuring, Chief Financial
Officer Sophie Stabile told journalists. Cash flows in 2012 will
be used to invest in existing infrastructure, for acquisitions
and restructuring and to pay a dividend, Stabile said at a
conference today.  The company reported last month that revenue in 2011 rose
2.5 percent to 6.1 billion euros. Fourth-quarter sales fell 1.1
percent to 1.5 billion euros, affected by a strategy of selling
and leasing back hotels, the company said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
