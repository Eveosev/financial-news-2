Tom Martinez, who mentored New
England Patriots quarterback  Tom Brady  and won 1,400 games as a
community college coach, died on his 66th birthday while
awaiting a kidney transplant, the  San Mateo Daily Journal  said.  Martinez led football, basketball and softball teams to 32
championships in as many years at the College of San Mateo in
the  San Francisco  Bay area.  “He really was the representation of Bulldog athletics,”
former Athletic Director Gary Dilley told the newspaper. “It’s
great he made such a great contribution to Tom Brady, but really
the mark he made was in the hearts he trained and coached at
CSM.”  Martinez, who also had diabetes, died of a heart attack,
the Daily Journal said. After retiring from coaching in 2007, he
continued to work with college and National Football League
quarterbacks.  Brady, a three-time Super Bowl champion and a native of  San
Mateo , worked with Martinez between NFL seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
