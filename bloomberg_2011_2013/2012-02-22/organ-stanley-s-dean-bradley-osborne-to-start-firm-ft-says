Morgan Stanley (MS)  senior investment
bankers Gordon Dean, Mark Bradley and Nicholas Osborne left the
company to start their own advisory firm, according to the
Financial Times.  The new firm will be called Dean Bradley Osborne or DBO
Partners, the FT reported,  citing interviews with the bankers.
The company will be a boutique adviser, often defined as a firm
that doesn’t underwrite public securities or engage in
commercial banking, the paper reported.  The bankers plan to hire “aggressively” from  New York- 
based Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street firms, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
