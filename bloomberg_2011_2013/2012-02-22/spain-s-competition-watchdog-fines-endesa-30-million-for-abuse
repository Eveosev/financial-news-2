Spain ’s competition regulator fined
 Endesa SA (ELE)  23 million euros ($30 million) for two counts of
abusing its dominant market position.  Endesa, as the main power distributor in parts of Spain,
used privileged information from clients’ requests for grid
connections when bidding for those contracts, skewing the market
in their favor, the regulator said in an e-mailed press release.
An Endesa spokesman, who asked not to be named citing company
policy, said the company will challenge the ruling in the
National Court.  The fine comes as the Spanish government is devising
changes to the power market that may force utilities to accept
some of the costs of closing a shortfall in power system revenue
that has created a debt of almost 24 billion euros.  The watchdog last year fined Endesa’s rivals  Gas Natural
SDG SA (GAS) ,  E.ON AG (EOAN)  and Energias de Portugal SA’s Hidrocantabrico
Energia SA unit for similar offenses while Endesa was sanctioned
for the same conduct in Mallorca in 2006.  The fine accounts for about 1 percent of the 2.2 billion
euros in net income that analysts expect the company to report
for 2011 when it publishes its results next week.  The company also charged clients for connection work it is
supposed to pay for under Spanish law, the competition regulator
said.  Endesa said the ruling contradicts Spanish law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
