Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., told CNBC that
implementation risks remain in  Greece ’s bailout agreement.  The agreement helps a “little,” El-Erian, who is also co-
chief investment officer of  Newport Beach , California-based
Pimco, told the cable network in an interview today. Still,
“people have to be convinced that the Greek agreement will
pass,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
