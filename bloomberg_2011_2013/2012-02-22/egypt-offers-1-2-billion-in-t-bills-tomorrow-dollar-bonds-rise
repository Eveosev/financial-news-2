Egypt  will offer 7 billion pounds
($1.2 billion) in local debt tomorrow after yields fell at last
week’s sale as the government said it’s closer to getting
International Monetary Fund aid. The 2020 dollar bonds rose.  The North African country will seek bids for  six-month  and
 one-year notes  valued at 3 billion pounds and 4 billion pounds,
respectively, according to Central Bank of Egypt data on
Bloomberg. The average yield on one-year bills fell one basis
point, or 0.01 of a percentage point, to 15.965 percent at a
sale last week. It had risen in the previous 16 auctions. The
rate on six-month notes declined two basis points last week to
14.918 percent.  Egypt will sign an agreement with the  International
Monetary Fund  for a $3.2 billion loan in March, state-owned  Al
Ahram  reported Feb. 19, citing Finance Minister Momtaz el- Saieed. The nation needs to secure IMF money as part of its
drive to meet financing needs of about $11 billion by June 2013,
el-Saieed said Feb. 10.  The country’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020 gained,
pushing the yield down one basis point, or 0.01 of a percentage
point, to 7.27 percent at 12:10 p.m. in Cairo, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The pound was little changed at
6.0365 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
