Universal Entertainment Corp. (6425) 
climbed the most in more than a year in  Tokyo  trading after the
Japanese pachinko machine maker pledged legal action against
 Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  over the forcible redemption of its stake.  Universal (6245)  rose 13 percent, the biggest jump since Nov. 8,
2010, to 1,700 yen at the close of trading in Tokyo. The gain
follows the record 21 percent drop for the  shares  on Feb. 20,
the first trading day after Wynn said it bought out Universal,
its largest investor, for $1.9 billion, about 31 percent less
than the market price for the shares.  “Universal Entertainment’s rebound means that the market
has prepared and taken this into account,” said Mitsushige
Akino, chief  fund manager  at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Universal (6425)  said its affiliate Aruze USA, owner of the Wynn
stake, would seek a court order to prevent the forced
redemption, according to a statement the company e-mailed today.
Wynn had accused Universal Chairman Kazuo Okada of making
improper payments to Philippine gambling regulators and asked
him to step down as a Wynn Resorts director.  Okada violated U.S. anti-corruption laws and made cash
payments and gifts of about $110,000 to Philippine officials,
Wynn said in a Feb. 19 statement. Wynn said it would give
Universal a $1.9 billion promissory note for its 19.65 percent
stake, worth about $2.77 billion based on the last closing price
before Wynn’s statement.  “We have absolutely not provided funds which would be the
equivalent to bribes to anyone,” Universal spokesman Nobuyuki
Horiuchi said by phone yesterday.  Universal (6425) , which gets about 95 percent of revenue from
making pachinko machines, is building a $2.3 billion casino
resort in the  Philippines  and has said it’s interested in
operating casinos in  Japan  should the government lift its ban.  To contact the reporters on this story:
