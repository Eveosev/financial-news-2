Australian Foreign Minister  Kevin Rudd  resigned after rising speculation that he would challenge
Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  for the leadership job she ousted
him from in 2010.  Rudd said in a late-night press briefing in Washington that
the leadership question had affected the business of government,
and that he will consult with his family and colleagues on the
future. Rudd said that the prime minister had failed to
repudiate attacks on him.  The decision follows a public spat among supporters of
Gillard and Rudd as the government’s poll ratings decline in the
wake of legislation on taxes on mining, which has propelled the
nation’s economy. Gillard, 50, Australia’s first female leader,
has sought to refocus attention on an agenda that includes
enacting “nation-changing reform” to counter climate change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
