Croatia  will probably seek investors
for an off-shore wind farm, estimated at 2.5 billion euros ($3.3
billion),  Poslovni Dnevnik  reported today, citing Nenad Koncar,
head of the management board of Jadranska Ulaganja d.o.o.  The Zagreb-based company last year gave an offer to buy
three money-losing shipyards on Croatiaâ€™s Adriatic coast and is
currently doing due diligence, according to Poslovni.  To contact the reporter on this story:
