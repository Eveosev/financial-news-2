Shanghai  eased home purchase
restrictions to allow a broader pool of buyers to purchase a
second property in China’s financial center, Shanghai Securities
News reported today.  The city loosened its definition of locals to let residence
permit holders who have lived in the city for at least three
years to buy a second home, the official newspaper affiliated
with state-run Xinhua news agency said, citing an unidentified
official of the city’s housing regulator. It previously limited
the second-home option to locals, or those born in the city or 
who worked for an extended period of time and were officially 
recognized as locals, without specifying guidelines for non-locals.  “This is certainly a measure of easing,” said Jack Gong,
a Hong Kong-based analyst at Jefferies Group Inc. “But the
easing by the local government doesn’t mean the central
government will loosen its property controls.”  Officials from Shanghai and Beijing said earlier this year
they plan to keep their home purchase restrictions in 2012.
China won’t waver on its real estate controls and efforts to
bring prices down to a reasonable level to ensure fairness and
stability, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said on Feb. 12.  The latest easing may boost the city’s home sales by 20
percent to 30 percent, according to Jefferies.  The  gauge  tracking property stocks on the Shanghai
Composite Index surged 2.5 percent, set for the highest since
Nov. 4 and the biggest gain among five industry groups on the
benchmark. Poly Real Estate Group Co., the nation’s second-
biggest developer, climbed 2.6 percent to 11.27 yuan as of 10:06
a.m., set for the highest since Aug. 26.  Most Critical  The report came a week after the eastern Chinese city of
Wuhu reversed a decision to relax property curbs. The mid-sized
city in Anhui province had planned to waive a deed tax and
subsidize some purchases on Feb. 9, becoming the first Chinese
city this year to signal its intention to ease property measures.  It is not clear if the Shanghai easing will hold because
the restriction on home purchases “is the most critical”
tightening policy for the central government, Johnson Hu, a Hong
Kong-based analyst at CIMB-GK Securities Research, said in a
note to clients today.  About 671,000 residents in the city of 20 million were
issued residence permits as of March 2009,  China  Business News
reported today, citing the local statistics bureau. Residents
with at least a year of tax records in the city are allowed to
buy one home.  China’s January new home prices recorded their worst
performance in at least a year, with none of the 70 cities
monitored by the government posting gains. Shanghai’s housing
values fell 0.1 percent in January from December, the fourth
month of declines, the statistics bureau said Feb. 18.  --Bonnie Cao. Editors: Linus Chua, Andreea Papuc  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
