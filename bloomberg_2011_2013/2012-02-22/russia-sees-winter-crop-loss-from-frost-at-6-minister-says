Russian farmers will lose about 6
percent of winter grain because of frost, Agriculture Minister
 Yelena Skrynnik  said today in an interview published in the
government’s  Rossiyskaya Gazeta  newspaper.  There’s “no serious danger to winter crops” and damage in
the southern Krasnodar and Rostov regions is “insignificant,”
the minister said. Spring sowing may compensate for the losses,
she said.  Skrynnik said that she expects the new grain crop to be at
least as big as last year’s, or almost 94 million metric tons,
and that the risk of drought is minimal. The Moscow-based
Institute for Agricultural Market Studies warned last month that
 Russia  could suffer crop-damaging drought in spring or summer.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
