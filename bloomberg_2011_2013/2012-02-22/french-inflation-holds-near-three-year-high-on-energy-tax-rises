France ’s inflation rate held near a
three-year high in January as President Nicolas Sarkozy’s
government increased sales tax rates on some goods and services
and energy prices climbed.  Consumer prices  rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier based
on European Union methodology, compared with increases of 2.7
percent in November and December, national statistics office
Insee said today. The November increase was the highest since
Oct. 2008. Economists had forecast a 2.7 percent gain, according
to the median of 17 estimates gathered by Bloomberg.  With London crude-oil prices up 13 percent in a year and
the government seeking to raise revenue through sales tax
increases, prices will probably continue to rise in  Europe ’s
second-largest economy for much of 2012, economists said.  “Inflation isn’t set to fall back, though the share of
energy costs in the increases should decline,” said  Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP Paribas in Paris.  In the month, prices fell 0.4 percent, helped by France’s
semi-annual sales period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
