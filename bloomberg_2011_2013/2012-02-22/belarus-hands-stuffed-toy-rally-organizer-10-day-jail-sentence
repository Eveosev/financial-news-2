A Belarusian court jailed Pavel
Vinogradov, an opposition activist who has served prison time
for taking part in political demonstrations, for 10 days after
he organized an anti-government rally using stuffed toys.  Teddy bears, toy puppies and hares were placed Feb. 10 on a
snow-covered flower bed in front of government headquarters on
Nezavisimosti Square in the capital, Minsk, the Belapan news
agency reported today.  They held paper signs with slogans such as “Toys against
lawlessness,” “Cops tore my eye off” and “Alejandro! Set the
people free!” in reference to Aleksandr Lukashenko, Belarus’s
president, Belapan said.  Vinogradov, a member of the opposition Tell the Truth!
Movement, which is led by former presidential candidate Vladimir
Neklyaev, was arrested yesterday and charged with organizing the
unsanctioned rally, according to the report. Vinogradov was
sentenced to four years in prison for participating in mass
unrest after Dec. 19, 2010 presidential elections. He was
released Sept. 14, 2011.  In a separate incident last year, Belarusian authorities
fined a one-armed man for clapping during an anti-government
rally in Grodno, a city near the Polish border, RIA Novosti
reported July 8, citing opposition website Charter 97.  The man took part in a demonstration involving spontaneous
rounds of applause among protesters as Belarusians rallied
against the government’s handling of the nation’s economic
crisis, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
