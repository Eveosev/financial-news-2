Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) , the U.K.’s
largest homebuilder by volume, said the company had its best
spring selling season in five years as reservations and prices
increased. The shares rose the most since Feb. 28.  Net private reservations rose 25.3 percent in the 18 weeks
through May 6 compared with a year earlier, the London-based
company said today in a statement. The average selling price for
private homes gained 5 percent.  U.K. homebuilders are widening profit margins by focusing
more on houses and developing low-cost land bought during the
recession that ended in 2009. Spring is generally the strongest
season of the year for homebuilders and the period is seen as a
guide to their full-year performance.  “We have had our strongest spring selling season for five
years,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Clare said in the
statement. “We’re ahead on achieving our objectives of
improving profitability and reducing net debt.”  Barratt increased its estimate for full-year completions by
600 homes to 12,600. The value of private forward sales
increased 16.1 percent from a year earlier, the company said.  The homebuilder expects net  debt  to total 275 million
pounds ($444 million) by June 30, about 75 million pounds below
its previous forecast.  Barratt climbed 5.4 percent to 126.4 pence in  London . The
shares have advanced 36 percent this year, raising the company’s
market value to 1.23 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
