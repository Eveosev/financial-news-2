New York Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin has rented a condominium in Manhattan’s  W Downtown Hotel &
Residences , said a spokeswoman for the building’s operator.  Lin is leasing a furnished, 1,180-square-foot (110-square-
meter), two-bedroom apartment in the Financial District tower,
with southern views that include the Statue of Liberty, said
Daniella Weinberg, a New York-based spokeswoman for  Starwood
Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) ’s W Hotels.  The 57-story W Downtown Hotel & Residences, built by New
York developer Joseph Moinian near the  World Trade Center site ,
includes 217 hotel rooms and 222 condominium units, according to
 Streeteasy.com , a property-listings website. Residents of the
condo units, which begin on the 32nd floor, have access to all
the hotel amenities, including room service and daily
housekeeping.  Lin’s agent,  Roger Montgomery , didn’t immediately respond
to a voicemail and e-mail seeking comment. Jonathan Supranowitz,
a Knicks spokesman, declined to comment.  Lin, 23, has averaged 24.5 points and 9.4 assists while
leading the Knicks to a 7-2 record since taking over as a
starter on Feb. 6. The former Harvard University point guard has
a base salary of about $762,000 this season.  Lin’s rental of the apartment was reported earlier today by
the New York Post.  To contact the reporters on this story:
