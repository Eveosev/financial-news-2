The Syrian government is responsible
for the deaths and injuries to journalists in a bombardment of a
residential neighborhood in the Syrian city of Homs, French
Foreign Affairs Minister  Alain Juppe  said.  “ France  holds the Syrian authorities responsible and
accountable for the life of our national and our injured,”
Juppe said today in an e-mailed ministry statement.  Juppe said the French embassy had urged the government to
allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide
aid to the injured. A French photographer was killed in the
attack.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Juppe “express
France’s strongest condemnation in the face of these new
barbaric acts by the regime in Damascus,” according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
