The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development may lend 11 million euros ($14.6 million) to
 Serbia ’s northernmost city, Subotica, to upgrade its water
supply and wastewater system.  Pending the bank’s board approval, expected on April 25,
the city of 140,000 people would get the funds supporting a 29.2
million-euro project to build a new collector, a water treatment
plant and a new water distribution aqueduct, the London-based
lender said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
