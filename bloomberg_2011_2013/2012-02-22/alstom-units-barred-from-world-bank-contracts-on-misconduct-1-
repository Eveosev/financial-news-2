Alstom SA (ALO) , the third-largest maker
of power equipment, won’t receive World Bank-funded contracts
for two of its units for three years after acknowledging payment
misconduct on a Zambian project, the lender said.  The restrictions for Alstom Hydro  France  and Alstom Network
Schweiz AG are the result a “negotiated resolution agreement”
that includes a restitution payment by the two companies
totalling about $9.5 million, the Washington-based World Bank
said today in a statement.  Alstom made an improper payment of 110,000 euros ($146,000)
in 2002 to an entity controlled by a former senior government
official for consulting on a World Bank-financed hydropower
project in Zambia, the lender said. An Alstom spokeswoman
couldn’t be reached for comment.  The settlement “is a wakeup call to global companies that
are involved in development business that need to ensure their
operations with the  World Bank  are clean,” Leonard McCarthy,
the lender’s vice president for integrity, said in the
statement.  The hydropower subsidiaries of the French engineering
company also won’t be eligible for projects paid for by other
lenders including the  Asian Development Bank , the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, and the  Inter-American
Development Bank .  The debarment can be reduced to 21 months if the companies
comply with all conditions of the agreement, the World Bank
said. The agreement doesn’t prevent Alstom and its other
affiliates from winning contracts from the development banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
