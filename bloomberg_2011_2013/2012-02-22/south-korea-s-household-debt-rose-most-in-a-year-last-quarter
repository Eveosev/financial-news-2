South  Korea ’s  household debt  rose
most in a year last quarter on borrowing to buy or rent homes.  Household credit, the sum of loans and credit purchases,
climbed 22.3 trillion won ($19.8 billion) to a record 912.9
trillion won in the three months ended Dec. 31 from the previous
quarter, the Bank of Korea said in Seoul today. From a year
earlier, household debt gained 7.8 percent.  The Bank of Korea left  borrowing costs  unchanged for an
eighth month on Feb. 9, the longest pause since tightening began
in July 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis damped the nation’s export.  To contact the reporter on this story:
