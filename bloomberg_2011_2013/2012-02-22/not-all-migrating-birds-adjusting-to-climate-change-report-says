Some birds are adjusting their
migration patterns and adapting to  climate change  better than
others, researchers found.  A study of bird flight patterns found that while some shift
their migration as much as six days earlier in warmer weather,
others are keeping the same habits, according to a  report  in the
Public Library of Science.  Birds that aren’t adapting, like the Barn Swallow, could be
threatened if the crop of insects they feed on aren’t available
at the same time, for example, said Allen Hurlbert, the lead
author, in a telephone interview.  “This is a new threat,” said Hurlbert, an assistant
professor of biology at the University of  North Carolina  at
 Chapel Hill . “It’s an additional risk factor for the health of
their population.”  Hurlbert’s study of 18 bird species is the first to examine
the entire Eastern  United States , he said. It’s also unique in
using citizen bird watching data from more than 50,000 people
logging into eBird, an online site created in 2002 by the
Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the National Audobon Society.  On average, the birds shifted their migration almost a day
earlier for every Celsius degree of warming spring temperature.
Species that fail could be eliminated through natural selection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
