A Kazakh business lobby group is
asking the government to channel resources from the countryâ€™s
$45.5 billion National Oil Fund, which is managed by the central
bank, to help finance small and medium-sized businesses.  Companies outside the energy industry need about $5 billion
from the fund, Ablay Myrzakhmetov, the head of business
association Soyuz Atameken, told reporters today in the capital,
Astana, citing preliminary estimates.  Kazakhstan, the largest oil producer in the former  Soviet
Union  after  Russia , plans to withdraw some of the billions of
dollars it keeps with Western banks to fund projects designed to
help diversify the economy away from resource extraction,
President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  said last month.  The amount of financial assistance will be determined after
discussions with the government, Myrzakhmetov said. Assets held
by the National Oil Fund advanced 4.2 percent to $45.5 billion
in January, the central bank said Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
