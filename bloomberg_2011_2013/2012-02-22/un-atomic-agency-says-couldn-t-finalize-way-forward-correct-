(Corrects quote in headline, first and second paragraph.)  The  United Nations ’ atomic energy
agency “could not finalize a way forward” during its talks in
 Iran , the body’s chief inspector Herman Nackaerts told
journalists in Vienna upon his return from Tehran.  “We could not get access and we could not finalize a way
forward,” Nackaerts said. He did not specify whether the
International Atomic Energy Agency team sought access to Iran’s
