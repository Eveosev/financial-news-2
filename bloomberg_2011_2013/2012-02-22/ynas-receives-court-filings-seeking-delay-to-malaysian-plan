Lynas Corp. (LYC) , an Australian mining
company building the world’s largest refinery of rare earths in
 Malaysia , said a group of people who live in the region have
begun court action to review the plant’s operating licence.  “The application seeks the court’s permission to” review
the decision by the Malaysian Atomic Energy Licensing Board  to
grant a temporary operating licence to start the plant, the
 Sydney-based miner  company said today in a statement. The
application also seeks to delay the plant’s start up, it said.  Lynas has been served with court documents relating to the
board’s decision, the company said. Malaysia’s government said
yesterday it will set up a monitoring unit to undertake a
construction audit to ensure that the refinery plant complies
with all standards imposed.  Lynas shares fell 2.3 percent to A$1.26 at 10:17 a.m.
Sydney time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
