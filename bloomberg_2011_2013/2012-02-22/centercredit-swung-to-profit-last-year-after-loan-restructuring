Bank Centercredit (CCBN) , the Kazakh lender
part-owned by  South Korea ’s Kookmin Bank, swung to a profit of
2.7 billion tenge ($18.5 million) last year from a 30.7 billion
tenge loss in 2010.  Total assets shrank to 1.1 trillion tenge, compared with
1.2 trillion tenge a year earlier, even as loans to customers
and banks advanced 9.3 percent to 764.8 billion tenge, the
Almaty-based bank  said  in a consolidated financial report
calculated under international standards and published on its
website today. Kookmin owns 41.9 percent of the Centercredit.  Centercredit improved returns on its loan holdings after
restructuring part of the portfolio, Timur Ishmuratov, treasury
director at the bank, said by phone today. Profits at the bank’s
units, including its brokerage and pension fund, contributed to
last year’s earnings, he said.  While the lender doesn’t plan to borrow abroad, it may
consider domestic debt sales this year, Ishmuratov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
