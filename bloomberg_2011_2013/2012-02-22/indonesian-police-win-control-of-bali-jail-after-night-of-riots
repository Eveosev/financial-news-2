Hundreds of police regained control
of a jail on the Indonesian resort island of Bali after rioting
inmates started fires and battled with guards.  The violence began late yesterday in Kerobokan jail in the
island’s capital of Denpasar when a prisoner discovered that a
knife he’d been stabbed with during a fight went missing and he
confronted a warden, Saud Usman Nasution, the nation’s police
spokesman, said today by phone from Jakarta.  “The man was provoked by his fellow inmates to start a
fight,” said Nasution. Eight hundred police officers were sent
into the prison, which houses more than a thousand convicts, he
said, adding that three inmates were injured during the riot.  Fire engines and water cannon were used to douse fires in
the warden’s office, police said in a statement posted on the
force’s  website.  Only 30 police remained at the jail, Nasution
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
