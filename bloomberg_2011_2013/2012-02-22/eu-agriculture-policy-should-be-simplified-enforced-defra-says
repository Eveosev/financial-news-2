The European Union’s Common
Agricultural Policy needs to be simplified and checks should be
put in place to ensure rules on “greening” are followed, the
U.K. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.  The European Commission’s CAP proposal calls for 7 percent
of farmland to be crop-free, 30 percent of national agriculture
budgets to go towards environmental programs, and will force
farmers to diversify harvests, the commission said on Jan. 21.
The policy, being debated by  member states , is set to go into
effect at the end of 2013. The rules will have to be enforced to
be effective, said Defra’s Martin Nesbit, director for EU and
international agriculture.  “If we’re asking the CAP to buy more public benefits, for
example through greening, we need to be able to check that it’s
happening,” Nesbit said today during a speech at the National
Farmers Union conference in Birmingham,  England . “We need to
get rid of unnecessary complexity.”  European commissioners and members of parliament need to be
aware that environmental programs outlined by the CAP may
disrupt crop rotations and other farming decisions, Nesbit said.  “How disruptive of farm business decision-making is it
going to be,” he asked. “Implementing permanent grassland
risks interfering with decisions on grass rotation.
Diversification doesn’t tackle the issue of crop rotation and
potentially creates real problems for livestock farmers and on
arable land.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
