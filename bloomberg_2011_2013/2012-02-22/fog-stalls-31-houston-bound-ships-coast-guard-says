Forty-eight ships were awaiting
passage through the  Houston Ship Channel  to the largest U.S.
petroleum port at about 6 a.m. local time today after dense fog
hampered visibility for a third morning, the U.S. Coast Guard
said.  Houston port pilots suspended transits at 6 p.m. local time
yesterday, Albert Hernandez, a Coast Guard watch supervisor,
said today in a telephone interview. Pilots serving other ports
in Galveston Bay, Galveston and  Texas City  halted operations at
6:15 p.m., he said.  As of 6 a.m., 26 ships were in Houston waiting to depart,
he said. For Houston and Texas City, five ships were waiting to
enter Galveston Bay and three were waiting to leave, he said.  A dense fog advisory is in effect for the area until noon
local time today, the  National Weather Service  said in a 3:13
a.m. local time  notice  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
