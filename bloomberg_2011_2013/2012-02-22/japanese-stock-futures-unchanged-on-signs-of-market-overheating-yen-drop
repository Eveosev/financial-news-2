Japanese  stock   futures  were
unchanged as technical indicators signaled shares have been
overbought, while the yen’s drop to a seven-month low against
the dollar buoyed the earnings outlook for exporters. Australian
equities slipped.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s
No. 1 carmaker, advanced 0.1 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Shares of  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , Japan’s least
profitable major carmaker, may be active as it plans to raise as
much as 232.8 billion yen ($2.9 billion) after forecasting its
largest annual loss in 11 years. Fairfax Media Ltd., Australia’s
second-biggest newspaper publisher, fell 2.4 percent after
reporting first-half profit slumped 42 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 9,570 in Chicago yesterday, unchanged from the
level in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,570
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
slipped 0.1 percent in early Sydney trading today. New Zealand’s
NZX 50 Index gained 0.1 percent in Wellington.  “Stocks are likely to fluctuate around yesterday’s closing
price as the yen’s weakness supports an overheating market,”
said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo. “Should the yen
fall further, carmakers may lead the market higher.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index dropped 0.3 percent in New York
yesterday as purchases of previously-owned homes rose to a 4.57
million annual rate, less than forecast, a report from the
National Association of Realtors showed.  Yen Slips  The yen touched 80.40 per dollar yesterday, the lowest
level since July 11. A weaker yen boosts the value of Japanese
exporters’ earnings overseas.  The  14-day relative strength index  for the Nikkei average
rose to 79.5 yesterday, staying above the 70 threshold that some
traders say signals stocks are overbought and may fall. The 25-
day Toraku index, which compares the number of equities that
have advanced with those that declined on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, rose to 141 yesterday. Investors view a reading above
120 as a sign shares may decline.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 12 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8 percent advance by the  S&P
500  and an 8.2 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13 times for the S&P 500 and
11 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese equities traded in the U.S. rebounded from a one-
week low on speculation policy makers will cut  interest rates  to
spur the economy. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of the most-
traded Chinese shares in the U.S. rose for the first time in
three days, adding 1 percent to 107.69 yesterday in New York.  Crude for April delivery added 3 cents to $106.28 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since May 4. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum rose 0.3 percent
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
