Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is installing a solar
power plant and fuel-cell system at its North Carolina  data
center .  The 20-megawatt solar energy project is being built on 100
acres (40 hectares) at its Maiden data center together with a 5-
megawatt fuel cell power plant running on biogas, Cupertino,
California-based Apple said yesterday in its 2012 Environmental
Update facilities  report .  Located about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of Charlotte,
the plants will supply about 82 million kilowatt-hours of power
to the data center that was completed last year and are part of
Apple’s goal of achieving net zero energy use.  Last year Apple used 493 million kilowatt-hours of
electricity, it said in the report. The cost of the plants
wasn’t disclosed. Kristin Huguet, Apple’s corporate
communications manager, wouldn’t say which companies are
providing the renewable energy equipment or when the systems
will enter operation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
