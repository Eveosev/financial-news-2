Chile ’s peso snapped a four-day
winning streak after lower-than-forecast economic data from
 China  and Europe pushed down copper, the South American
country’s biggest export, and stifled demand for riskier
emerging-market assets.  The peso fell 0.4 percent to 483.25 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close in Santiago, from 481.5 yesterday.  “The drop in copper prices, the fall of the euro earlier
today and global stocks moved the peso,” Francisca Roa, an
analyst at Netgociando.com, said today in a phone interview.
“We see a deterioration of external factors that is having an
effect on the  exchange rate  here.”  Copper retreated as much as 1.1 percent in  New York  and
global stocks fell. The euro weakened as much as 0.2 percent
earlier today before recovering and gaining 0.1 percent.  A purchasing-managers index of euro-area services and
manufacturing dropped to 49.7, London-based Markit Economics
said, below the 50.5 median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. A preliminary indicator from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics signaled that Chinese manufacturing activity
may shrink for a fourth straight month.  A central bank survey today said that Chilean traders and
investors forecast the monetary authority will keep its key
 interest rate  at 5 percent in March as inflation estimates
increase. Traders also raised their 12-month annual inflation
forecast to 3.2 percent from 3.09 percent on Feb. 7.  Chile’s central bank sold today on behalf of the government
10- and 20-year peso bonds to yield 5.48 and 5.7 percent,
respectively. It also sold inflation-adjusted notes due in the
same periods at 2.43 percent and 2.78 percent.  Two-year inflation swaps in pesos fell by two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.88 percent. The yield on a basket
of 10-year inflation-adjusted bonds rose seven basis points to
2.45 percent, while one-year break-even inflation fell 2 basis
points to 3.19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
