OneSteel Ltd. (OST) ,  Australia ’s second-
biggest steelmaker, gained for a second day in Sydney trading
after saying it is switching focus to  iron ore  from its
unprofitable steel unit.  The  shares  climbed 16 percent to close at 95 Australian
cents, adding to their 12 percent gain yesterday.  OneSteel is considering changing its name as it plans to
almost double iron ore production in two years. The company
yesterday reported underlying earnings of A$78 million ($83
million), beating its own guidance of as much as A$75 million.  ‘We saw an uplift yesterday and we’re seeing a significant
follow through here today,”  Jamie Spiteri , head dealer at Shaw
Stockbroking Ltd. in Sydney, said by phone. “The group
highlighted the fact that its  steel industry  is no longer the
prominent component of its earnings base and it’s got the
capacity for further expansion in years to come.”  Mining will account for more than half its assets when iron
ore production reaches 11 million metric tons a year at full
capacity after June 2013, OneSteel Chief Executive Geoff Plummer
said yesterday. It plans to produce 6 million tons of iron ore
this fiscal year.  “We see value in the iron ore business and mining
consumables business, which are both key drivers of earnings
while Australian steel remains weak,” UBS AG analysts Andrew Moller, Glyn Lawcock and Daniel Morgan said in a report
published today. The analysts had a “buy” rating on the stock
and a 12-month price target of between A$1.50 and A$1.61.  To contact the reporter on this story:
