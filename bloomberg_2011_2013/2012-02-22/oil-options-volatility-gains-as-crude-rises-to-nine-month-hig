Oil options volatility increased as
crude rose to a nine-month high in New York after International
Atomic Energy Agency officials were denied access to an Iranian
military base.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 30.7 as of 3 p.m. in New York, up from
30.6 yesterday.  Crude oil for April delivery increased 3 cents to $106.28 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since May 4. Futures have gained 14 percent in the
past year.  “We’re not seeing the futures volatility be very big,”
Vince Lanci, owner of Echobay Partners LLC, a commodity option
trading firm in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said by phone. “Since
the implied predicts the future, people are concerned about the
Iranian crisis.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
June $95 puts. They gained 13 cents to $2.18 a barrel with 2,955
contracts trading as of 3:05 p.m. in New York. Next were April
$100 puts, which rose 6 cents to $1.03 a barrel on 2,481 lots. A
contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude. Puts were 60 percent of
the volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Calls accounted for 61 percent of the volume yesterday. May
$119 calls were the most actively traded options, with 10,073
lots changing hands. They rose 32 cents to $1.59 a barrel. The
next-most active options, April $92 puts, fell 16 cents to 20
cents a barrel on volume of 8,000 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 42,426
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 37,450 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,550.  To contact the reporter on this story:
