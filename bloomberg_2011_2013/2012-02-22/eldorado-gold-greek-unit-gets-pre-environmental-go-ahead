Thracean Gold Mining SA , a unit of
 Canada â€™s  Eldorado Gold Corp. (ELD) , said  Greece  approved the pre-
environmental impact assessment for a gold project in the north
of the country.  The Perama Hill gold project in northeastern Greece
consists of two mining titles covering an area of 1,897.5
hectares and two mining exploration licenses for an area of
1,762.7 hectares. Eldorado forecasts the average gold production
at the site will be 110,000 ounces per year.  Thracean will submit the full environmental impact
assessment in a few weeks, the Athens-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. Thracean will invest 150 million euros
($198.5 million) to build the Perama site within 18 months while
the cost to operate the site over eight years will be 200
million euros, according to the statement.  The project will generate 370 jobs at the initial
construction stage, 200 in the operation phase and 800 in
indirect employment in the area, Thracean said. Eldorado Gold
said on Dec. 19 it agreed to buy  European Goldfields Ltd. (EGU) , which
is also active in Greece, for about C$2.5 billion ($2.5
billion). Investors in the two companies yesterday approved the
deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
