Germany ’s risk exposure to  Greece 
will rise after the debt-strapped country secured a second
bailout package,  Die Welt  reported, citing its own calculations.  By 2014, outstanding loans and guarantees to Greece will
amount to 51 billion euros ($68 billion), of which 31 billion
euros are related to this week’s rescue package, provided it’s
disbursed in full, the newspaper said. Germany had Greece-
related risks of 30 billion euros before the second bailout, of
which 10 billion euros will have to be written down by state-
owned banks and public lenders as a result of the country’s debt
restructuring, Welt said.  The calculation doesn’t include Greek bonds held by the
region’s central banks, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
