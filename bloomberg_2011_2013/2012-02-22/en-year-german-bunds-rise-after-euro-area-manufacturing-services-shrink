German 10-year bunds advanced after
data showed European services and manufacturing output
unexpectedly shrank in February.  The bund yield fell three basis points to 1.95 percent at
9:17 a.m. London time.  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries dropped to 49.7 from 50.4 in
January, according to an  initial estimate . Economists had
forecast a reading of 50.5, according to the median of 16
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
