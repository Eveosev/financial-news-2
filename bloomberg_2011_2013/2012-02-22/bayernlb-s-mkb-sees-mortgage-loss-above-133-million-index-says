Bayerische Landesbank (BLGZ) ’s Hungarian
MKB Bank Zrt. unit expects to lose more than 29 billion forint
($133 million) because of a mortgage repayment law,  Index 
reported, citing the bank’s chief executive officer.  Almost 12,500 people, or more than 30 percent of eligible
clients, took advantage of a law allowing the early repayment of
foreign-currency home loans at below-market rates, the news
website cited Pal Simak, appointed to lead the bank from next
month, as saying in an interview.  The bank’s losses will exceed the more than 29 billion
forint it booked at the end of September in anticipation of the
loan repayment program, Simak said. The bank’s deposits have
recovered to late December’s level after “a negative wave which
lasted a few days,” Simak told Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
