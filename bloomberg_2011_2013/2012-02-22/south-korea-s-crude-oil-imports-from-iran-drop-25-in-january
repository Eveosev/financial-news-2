South Korea ’s crude imports from
Iran fell 25 percent in January, according to data from state-
run  Korea National Oil Corp (KNOCPZ) .  Asia ’s fourth-largest crude importer purchased 7.03 million
barrels of oil, or about 227,000 barrels a day, from Iran last
month, compared with 9.35 million a year earlier. South Korea
received 80.15 million barrels from overseas in January,
according to the data.  South Korea, which relies on imports for almost all of its
crude needs, is supporting U.S. efforts to impose sanctions on
Iranian oil to compel the country to abandon its alleged nuclear
weapons program. South Korea imported 926.8 million barrels of
crude last year, of which 9.4 percent were from  Iran .  To contact the reporter on this story:
