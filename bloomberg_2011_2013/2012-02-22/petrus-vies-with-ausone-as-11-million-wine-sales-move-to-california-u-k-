The most expensive Pomerol producers
Chateau Petrus and Le Pin are competing with Bordeaux first-
growth Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, Saint-Emilion estate Chateau
Ausone and top Burgundies at sales worth as much as $11 million.  Five auctions are scheduled this week in  London ,  New York 
and California.  Sotheby’s (BID)  has a top estimate of $1.78 million at
its London sale today,  Christie’s International (CHRS)  of $1.23 million
in a U.K. auction tomorrow and Zachy’s of $5.1 million at its
two-day Burgundy-focused sale in San Francisco ending Feb. 24.
Sotheby’s also has a New York sale Feb. 25 and Bonhams holds
events in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles the same day.  Prices for top Bordeaux wines have fallen 20 percent from
mid-2011 highs as Asian demand has switched to second-growths
and rarer Burgundies. There are signs now of the market
stabilizing, with the  Liv-ex 100 Fine Wine Index (LIVX100)  rising 1.4
percent in January, its first monthly gain since June.  “We have had six months of falling prices owing to the
selling down of inventories by major market players in response
to a two-year fine-wine-market bull run that ended in the spring
of 2011,”  Miles Davis  and William Beck, partners in London-
based  Wine Asset Managers LLP , wrote its February market report.  Bordeaux’s “very consumer-unfriendly 2010 en primeur
campaign, debt crises in the U.S. and  Europe  and a credit crunch
in  China ” have also pushed wine prices lower, they said.  The 15 percent drop in the  Liv-ex 100 Index (LIVX100)  last year
followed two years of gains, with a 40 percent jump in 2010.  Chateau Ausone  Christie’s sale includes cases of Ausone 2000 and Petrus
2001 each carrying a top estimate of 14,000 pounds ($22,200) as
well as cases of Lafite 2000 and 2003 valued at as much as
15,000 pounds and 13,000 pounds respectively.  The top estimate for the Ausone 2000 is 44 percent below
the HK$306,000 ($39,400) that a case of the same vintage fetched
at a  Christie’s  sale in  Hong Kong  in September 2010, as the two-
year bull market in wine approached its peak.  “There was a bit of a bubble and the auction market for
Bordeaux took a hit,”  Simon Davies , head of marketing at
London-based brokers Fine + Rare Wines Ltd., said in an
interview. “The new price structure has settled down now. Asian
bidders have got a lot more savvy and they’re not just buying to
show off to their friends.”  Sotheby’s  features a case of Le Pin 1990 carrying a top
estimate of 26,000 pounds and two lots of three Petrus 2000
magnums each priced at as much as 17,000 pounds.  Zachys Sale  Zachys  is holding its auction in  San Francisco  on Feb. 23
and Feb. 24. Its top lots include half a case of Romanee  Conti
Domaine de la Romanee Conti 1996  with a high estimate of
$60,000, a magnum of the same vintage at $20,000 and a three-
liter jeroboam at as much as $42,000.  Zachys also has three cases of Romanee Saint-Vivant Dujac
2009 from San Francisco-based Burgundy collector Wilf Jaeger,
who has had an investment in the vineyard since 2005. Each lot
carries a high estimate of $30,000, while two three-magnum lots
are on sale at $15,000 each and a jeroboam at $10,000.  At Sotheby’s in  New York  Feb. 25 top lots include two cases
of Petrus 1982 with a top estimate of $60,000. It estimates it
may sell as much as $1.9 million of wine at the auction.  Bonhams has sales on Feb. 25 in New York, San Francisco and
 Los Angeles , with a top estimated value of $1.59 million.  The  Liv-ex  market in London said its monthly transactions
rose 41 percent in January from a year earlier, with increased
trading in 2006 and 2008 Bordeaux wines. The 2009s led in value
terms and accounted for 13 percent of turnover before U.S.
critic  Robert Parker  releases revised vintage scores this month.  “What we’re seeing now in the market is it’s actually
strengthening by diversifying and going outside of the Bordeaux
box,”  John Kapon , Chief Executive Officer of New York-based
Acker Merrall & Condit, the world’s largest wine auction house,
said in an interview with Deirdre Bolton on Bloomberg
Television’s “Money Moves” Feb. 17. “Other consumers from
elsewhere are really looking to Burgundy, they’re looking to
 Italy , they’re looking to  California ,” Kapon said.  (Guy Collins and Scott Reyburn write about the art and wine
