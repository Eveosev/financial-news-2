Kathleen L. Casey, a former member
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has gone to work
at a Washington consulting firm run by another former Republican
commissioner, Paul S. Atkins.  Casey, a Republican who left office when her term expired
last year, will be a senior adviser at  Patomak Global Partners
LLC . The former Senate Banking Committee counsel and staff
director joins the financial services consulting firm at the
same time as another former SEC colleague, Brian Cartwright, who
was general counsel until 2009.  “Patomak offers unparalleled expertise in a boutique
setting,” Casey said today in an e-mail, saying she’s “pleased
to have the chance to work again with my former colleagues.”  Casey, who was replaced at the SEC by Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher, is also a fellow at  Georgetown University ’s
McDonough School of Business and an adjunct professor at George
Mason University School of Law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
