The  United Arab Emirates  may expand
its monopolies law, which sought to liberalize the sale of basic
food products, to tackle other monopolies, including car
dealers, Gulf News reported, citing the economy minister.  The move would boost competition and bring down costs by
curbing “all types of monopolies and exploitation,” Sultan bin
Saeed al-Mansouri said at a meeting of the country’s Federal
National Council yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
