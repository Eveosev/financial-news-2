Mosaic Co. (MOS) , the world’s largest
producer of phosphate crop nutrients, rose the most in six weeks
after saying it resolved a dispute with environmental groups
over the expansion of a Florida mine.  Mosaic gained 3.3 percent to $58.80 at the close in  New
York , the largest advance since Jan. 10.  An agreement between the company and groups including the
 Sierra Club  allows mining at the South Fort Meade mine in
Florida to return to normal, Plymouth, Minnesota-based Mosaic
said in a statement published yesterday after the close of
regular trading. The groups had challenged in court a planned
increase in the mining area. Mosaic has operated Fort Meade at a
reduced capacity since 2010 because of the dispute.  “This settlement provides certainty around our South Fort
Meade mine and we look forward to bringing it back to full
production,”  Richard Mack , Mosaic’s executive vice president
and general counsel, said in the statement.  Mosaic also is raising its  dividend  on an annual basis to
50 cents a share from 20 cents, Chief Executive Officer Jim Prokopanko said today.  The move is “based on the confidence we have in Mosaic’s
ability to drive financial results and the long-term
fundamentals of the industry,” Prokopanko said in a
presentation to analysts in Tampa, Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
