A Moroccan immigrant accused of
attempting a suicide bombing at the U.S. Capitol was ordered
held without bail at a hearing today in federal court in
 Virginia .  U.S. Magistrate Judge John F. Anderson in Alexandria,
citing the “serious charges” against El Khalifi and his
“immigration status,” said the suspect would be kept in jail
pending future action by the court. Anderson didn’t set a date
for the next hearing.  El Khalifi, 29, of Alexandria, who was caught up in an FBI
sting operation, was arrested in a parking garage near the
Capitol on Feb. 17 after meeting with an undercover agent posing
as a member of an armed extremist group, according to an
affidavit filed with a criminal complaint.  He was taken into custody as he began walking toward the
Capitol carrying a MAC-10 automatic weapon and wearing a vest
containing what he believed to be a functioning bomb, according
to the affidavit by Steven Hersem, an agent of the  Federal
Bureau of Investigation . The weapons, both of which were
provided by the government, had been made inoperable by
investigators, prosecutors said.  A Moroccan national, El Khalifi entered the U.S. in June
1999 on a tourist visa that expired later that year. He has
lived in the U.S. illegally since then, according to the
affidavit.  He is charged with attempted use a weapon of mass
destruction and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if
convicted.  The case is U.S. v. El Khalifi, 12-mj-00087, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria).  To contact the reporter on this story:
