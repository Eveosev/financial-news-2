Producer-price inflation in  Ghana ,
West  Africa ’s second-biggest economy, accelerated to 15.3
percent in January as prices for gold increased, said Philomena
Nyarko, acting head of the Ghana Statistical Service.  The  rate  increased from a 13.7 percent a month earlier, a
figure that was revised after additional data was received, she
told reporters in Accra, the capital, today. In the month,
prices rose 5.4 percent from a 1.5 percent contraction in
December, Nyarko said.  Mining and quarrying costs in Africa’s second-biggest gold
miner, which account for 14 percent of the index, climbed 28
percent in January from 18.2 percent the month before, Nyarko
said.  “Rising gold prices supported the increase that we saw in
the month” as the inflation rate includes the “international
price of gold received by producers,” she said. Prices for the
precious metal rose 11 percent in January.  Manufacturing costs, which make up 70 percent of the index,
increased 14.7 percent in January, down from 15.3 percent in the
previous month while utility costs rose 9.3 percent from 9.1
percent, Nyarko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
