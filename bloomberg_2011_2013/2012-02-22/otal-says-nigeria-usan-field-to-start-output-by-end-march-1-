Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-biggest
energy producer, said its Usan offshore oil field in Nigeria
will start production by the end of March and later reach a peak
rate of 180,000 barrels a day.  Exports of the new grade will total three cargoes of
950,000 barrels each in April, or 95,000 barrels a day, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News yesterday shows.  Total and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  will receive one shipment each,
while Glencore International Plc will get one lot from state-
owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., according to the plan.  The Egina field now under development is “progressing
well” and will also have a similar capacity, Guy Maurice,
managing director of Total Exploration and Production  Nigeria ,
told reporters today in Abuja, the capital.  Paris-based Total expects output to increase by an average
2.5 percent annually from the end of 2010 to 2015 with
production starting this year at the Usan project and Angola
LNG. By 2015, Total would have added 600,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day with 25 starts, Chief Executive Officer
Christophe de Margerie said on Feb. 10.  Africa’s largest oil producer, is the fifth-biggest source
of U.S. imports. Royal Dutch Shell Plc,  Exxon Mobil , Chevron
Corp., Total and Eni SpA operate joint ventures with NNPC that
pump about 90 percent of the country’s crude.  Output from Nigeria’s deep offshore waters account for
about 700,000 barrels a day, less than a third of the nation’s
average daily production of 2.39 million barrels last year,
according to the Petroleum Ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
