AT&T Inc. (T)  Chief Executive Officer
 Randall Stephenson  received a $2.08 million pay cut in 2011 for
failing to successfully complete the T-Mobile USA acquisition,
according to a federal filing.  Stephenson’s total pay, including stock, was $22 million, a
19 percent decline from the $27.3 million he received in 2010.  AT&T, the largest U.S. phone company, abandoned its $39
billion takeover bid for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile in
December, after facing opposition from federal regulators. The
Dallas-based company paid a $4 billion breakup fee to T-Mobile
after the deal was dissolved.  The company says its “named officers” all took a pay cut
to 75 percent to 80 percent of their target bonuses related to
the T-Mobile deal’s collapse.  “AT&T is committed to paying for performance and the
compensation reflects that,” said McCall Butler, a spokeswoman
for AT&T in  Washington , D.C.  Two executives -- Ralph de la Vega, CEO of AT&T Mobility,
and John Stankey, AT&T’s chief strategy officer -- received 100
percent of their bonuses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
