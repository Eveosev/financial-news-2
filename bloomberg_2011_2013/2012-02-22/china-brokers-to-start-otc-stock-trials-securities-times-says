Ping An Securities Co. , the
brokerage arm of  China ’s second-largest insurer, and nine other
Chinese brokerages were named to start over-the-counter equities
markets in different Chinese provinces under a trial program,
according to a  Securities Times  report.  Changjiang Securities Co. (000783) , China Securities Co., Hongyuan
Securities Co., Industrial Securities Co., Northeast Securities
Co., Qilu Securities Co., Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.,
Southwest Securities Co. and Western Securities Co. were also
chosen, the newspaper reported, citing brokerage sources it
didn’t identify.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission didn’t
immediately respond to faxed questions. Ping An Securities
hadn’t received any notice from regulators, an official with the
company’s Shenzhen-based administrative office, who declined to
be identified because of company policy, said by phone today.  Developing the over-the-counter market may help bolster
stock trading turnover in China that has fallen to three-year
lows as money supply tightens and the economy slows. The
benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  has risen 9.3 percent this
year, lagging behind a 16 percent surge in the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
