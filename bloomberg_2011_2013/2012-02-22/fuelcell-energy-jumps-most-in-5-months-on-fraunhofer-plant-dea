  FuelCell Energy Inc. (FCEL) , a U.S. maker
of fuel-cell power plants, rose the most in five months after it
said it will form a joint venture with Germanyâ€™s Fraunhofer IKTS
to develop projects in Europe.  FuelCell climbed 16 percent to close at $1.71 in  New York ,
the biggest gain since Sept. 7. The shares have almost doubled
this year.  The company, based in Danbury, Connecticut, will establish
a joint venture with Fraunhofer IKTS, or Institute for Ceramic
Technologies and Systems, to develop stationary power plants in
Europe using its direct fuel cell technology, FuelCell said
today in a statement.  FuelCell will lead market development and retain majority
ownership of the joint venture through a German unit. The
venture will seek to use incentives in the region for combined
heat and power generated by fuel-cell  power plants  running on
natural gas or biogas.  Fraunhofer, based in Dresden, will contribute research and
development resources as well as local knowledge and
relationships, FuelCell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
