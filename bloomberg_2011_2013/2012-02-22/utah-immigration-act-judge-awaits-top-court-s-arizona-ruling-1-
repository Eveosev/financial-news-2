The judge considering a federal
government bid to block enforcement of three  Utah  immigration
statutes said he won’t rule on the request until after the U.S.
 Supreme Court  decides a case involving a similar Arizona law.  U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups in  Salt Lake City , who
heard arguments from Utah and U.S. government lawyers on Feb.
17, issued a two-page order yesterday saying no ruling would be
made until after the high court ruled.  “Although Arizona’s law is different from Utah’s in
several respects, some aspects are sufficiently similar that the
Supreme Court’s ruling will likely inform this court in its
decision,” Waddoups wrote.  The Supreme Court in December said it would review a
federal appeals court decision last year to block an  Arizona  law
requiring police officers to check immigration status when they
arrest or stop somebody and have “reasonable suspicion” that
person is illegally present in the U.S.  Utah Governor Gary Herbert signed into law a similar
measure last year.  Waddoups said he would continue a temporary restraining
order he issued in May, blocking enforcement of the Utah statute
and two others the U.S. asserts infringe the federal
government’s sovereign control of immigration policy, until he
rules on the federal government’s request for a preliminary
injunction.  The case is Utah Coalition of La Raza v. Herbert, 11cv401,
U.S. District Court for the District of Utah (Salt Lake City).  To contact the reporter on this story:
