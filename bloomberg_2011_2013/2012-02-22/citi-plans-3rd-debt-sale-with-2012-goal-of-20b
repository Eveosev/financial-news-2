Citigroup Inc. (C)  sold $1.25 billion of
three-year notes in its third bond sale this year as the bank,
facing maturities from a 2008 emergency credit program, plans
during 2012 to raise as much as $20 billion in  capital markets .  The third-biggest U.S. bank by assets issued 2.65 percent
notes to yield 230 basis points, or 2.3 percentage points, more
than Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Wells
Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S. mortgage lender, sold
$1.25 billion of five-year floating-rate notes, the data show.  Citigroup, which sold $3.5 billion of five- and 30-year
debt last month, tapped the market as yields on bank debt fall
to 4 percent as of yesterday from 4.8 percent at the start of
the year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. New
York-based Citigroup plans to issue $15 billion to $20 billion
of long-term debt this year after selling $15 billion of the
securities in 2011, Treasurer Eric Aboaf said on a Jan. 24
earnings call.  “TLGP debt represented a significant amount of maturities
in 2011 and is the bulk of our maturities in 2012,” Aboaf said
on the call, referring to the U.S. government’s Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program enacted in 2008 to stem a global
financial crisis. “This wave of maturities is an industrywide
situation, which came about as many banks issued TLGP and other
government-guaranteed debt in 2008 and 2009,” he said.  The bank cut borrowing costs from a $500 million sale of
3.625 percent, three-year debt in December at a spread of 323.9
basis points, the data show.  John Deere Offering  John Deere Capital Corp., a finance unit of the world’s
largest farm equipment maker, sold $1.5 billion of debt today in
three parts, said a person with knowledge of the offering, who
declined to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly. The Deere & Co. unit issued 28-month floating rate
notes and five- and 10-year fixed-rate debt, the person said.  Wells Fargo sold the five-year floating-rate notes to yield
110 basis points above the three-month London interbank offered
rate, Bloomberg data show. Three-month  Libor (US0003M)  is 0.492 percent
today.  Citigroup has $38 billion of TLGP-related debt due this
year and $22.6 billion of unrelated debt maturing, according to
a  presentation  on Citigroup’s website. Last year, it had
$20.3 billion of TLGP debt mature and $30.4 billion of
non-TLGP debt.  The bank’s three-year debt “would be attractive all the
way to a spread of 170 basis points,” Morningstar Inc. analyst
James Leonard said in a research note today. The bank is “the
best-capitalized” of the four-largest U.S. banks, he said,
citing core Tier 1 capital of 11.8 percent and a Tier 1 ratio at
13.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
