California (STOCA1)  is seeking to use capital
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Bank Plc and other
lenders to encourage landlords to make energy-saving changes at
their buildings, state Senator Kevin de León said.  De León, a Los Angeles Democrat, introduced  legislation
 today that would make low-interest loans available to owners of
commercial and industrial property for energy retrofits. The
state would aggregate loans and issue revenue bonds to repay
them.  In an interview in the state Capitol in  Sacramento , de León
said the state also is working with Citigroup Inc.,  Wells Fargo
& Co . and GE Capital Corp. on providing “hundreds of millions
of dollars” to building owners.  “This will be a big boon,” de León said. “You’re getting
hundreds of millions of dollars in equity off the sidelines.”  De León, state Controller John Chiang and state Treasurer
Bill Lockyer have been working with the banks on a program they
said would help rejuvenate  California ’s construction industry
while curbing energy use.  The California Alternative Energy and Advanced
Transportation Financing Authority, whose members include Chiang
and Lockyer, would set criteria for building owners to qualify
for the loans.  To contact the reporters on this story:
