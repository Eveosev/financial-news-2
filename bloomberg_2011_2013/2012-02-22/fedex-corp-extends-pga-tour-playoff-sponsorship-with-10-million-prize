FedEx Corp. (FDX) , the second-largest U.S.
package-shipping company, signed a five-year extension to
sponsor the PGA Tour’s playoff system known as the FedEx Cup,
keeping a $10 million prize for the champion.  The agreement extends FedEx’s commitment through the 2017
season, PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said on a media
conference call from Marana,  Arizona , site of this week’s World
Golf Championships Match Play event.  The playoffs, which were formed in 2007, will continue to
offer $35 million in total bonus money to golfers based on their
finish in the season-long competition, including $10 million to
the FedEx Cup winner.  “We’ve seen it grow, it’s become a big part of what the
 PGA Tour  is about and it’s had the effect of pulling our season
together,” Finchem said. “We’re going to try to make some
adjustments in the next couple years with the FedEx Cup in an
even more impactful way.”  While the prize money remains the same currently, Finchem
said it probably will increase over the course of the extension.  “How that plays out in terms of the distribution of
dollars, we’re not sure, but we’ll certainly be going forward,
not backward,” he said. “Financially to the players, we will
be growing during this term.”  Tiger Woods won the first two FedEx Cup titles, followed by
 Vijay Singh  in 2009,  Jim Furyk  in 2010 and  Bill Haas  last year.  Final Birdie  Haas won the season-ending Tour Championship with a birdie
on the third hole of a playoff and said he didn’t initially
realize he had also won the FedEx Cup’s $10 million bonus. He
finished with 2,760 points, 15 more than runner-up  Webb Simpson ,
who won the second of the four playoff events.  Michael Glenn, FedEx’s executive vice president of market
development, said his company is pleased with the playoff format
and that there may be room for change.  “We’ve made tremendous progress in the point system over
the last several years,” Glenn said. “I can only point to the
last two years when we saw the winner change shot by shot on
Sunday, which is what FedEx would really like to have happen
every year. I don’t know how much more drama we can get.”  This year’s FedEx Cup playoffs begin Aug. 23-26 with The
Barclays tournament at Bethpage State Park’s Black Course in
Farmingdale, New York. Next is the Deutsche Bank Championship
the following week outside  Boston  and the BMW Championship on
Sept. 6-9 in Carmel,  Indiana . The Tour Championship is scheduled
for Sept. 20-23 at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta.  Television Deals  The extension with FedEx comes one month after Finchem, who
has been commissioner since 1994, received a four-year contract
extension. Finchem helped the PGA Tour reach nine-year
television agreements in September with CBS Corp. and Comcast
Corp.’s NBC.  “It is a nice addition to the things that have been
happening that lay out our future in a very positive way and
allow us to build the tour both domestically and
internationally,” Finchem said of the agreement with FedEx.  FedEx has been a PGA Tour partner since 1986, when it
became title sponsor of the FedEx St. Jude Classic in the
company’s home city of Memphis,  Tennessee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
