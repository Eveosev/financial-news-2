Ukraine’s President  Viktor Yanukovych  appointed Valery Khoroshkovsky as first deputy prime
minister in his latest Cabinet switch before parliamentary
elections in October.  Khoroshkovsky, 43, was also dismissed today as finance
minister, a post he assumed on Jan. 18, according to a statement
on Yanukovych’s official website. Khoroshkovsky had previously
been in charge of the Ukraine’s security service. He replaces
Andriy Klyuev, who was named as secretary of the National
Defense and Security Council last week.  Khoroshkovsky will lead talks with the  International
Monetary Fund  on a $15.6 billion loan program that’s been frozen
since last March as well as negotiations to strengthen ties with
the European Union. Before it resumes disbursements, the IMF has
demanded the government raise utility tariffs for households to
trim the state’s budget gap. The EU delayed the signing of an
association agreement, planned for December, because of the
imprisonment of the opposition leader  Yulia Tymoshenko .  To contact the reporter on this story:
