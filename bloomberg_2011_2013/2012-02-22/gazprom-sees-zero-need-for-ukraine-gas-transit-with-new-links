OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ,  Russia ’s natural gas
export monopoly, claimed that slated pipeline projects, such as
seabed lines directly to the European Union, will eliminate
reliance on Ukraine to transit the fuel to Europe.  “South Stream to full capacity, Nord Stream with
additional lines and our existing capacity through Belarus and
the  Black Sea  will reduce Ukraine’s importance for transit to
zero,” Gazprom spokesman  Sergei Kupriyanov  said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Ukraine ships as much as 80 percent of Russia’s Europe-
bound gas through its Soviet-era pipeline network. Disputes over
the cost of Russian gas to Ukraine and its transit led to a halt
in supplies to Europe in the winter of 2009. Ukraine is now
seeking price reductions from Gazprom.  Gazprom Chief Executive Alexey Miller accused Ukraine of
siphoning gas destined for  Europe  during a cold snap this month
in a briefing with Russian President Dimitry Medvedev today,
according to a statement on the Kremlin website. Ukraine’s
state-run energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy denied the
allegation in an e-mailed statement.  Medvedev urged Gazprom to move ahead with the construction
of the South Stream pipeline via the Black Sea to the E.U.
starting this December, according to the Kremlin statement. The
Nord Stream pipe carries gas from Russia across the bottom of
the  Baltic Sea  to Germany. Both pipelines bypass Belarus and
Ukraine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
