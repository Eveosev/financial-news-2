France Telecom SA (FTE) , the owner of the
Orange mobile-phone brand, cut its dividend forecast for this
year by as much as 14 percent as it predicts a decline in
operating cash flow.  The 2012 payout will be in a range of 1.21 euros to 1.35
euros a share, Chief Financial Officer Gervais Pellissier said
on a conference call. The Paris-based company had predicted 1.40
euros in dividend. Operating cash flow will be about 8 billion
euros ($10.6 billion) this year, declining from 9.3 billion
euros in 2011.  With one of the highest dividend yields in the
telecommunications  industry  in  Europe , the company has been
under pressure to lower dividend. Telefonica SA reduced its
dividend forecast in December.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell 3.9 percent to 3.47 billion euros ($4.6
billion), the Paris-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Sales slipped 2.6 percent to 11.43 billion euros.
Analysts had  predicted  Ebitda of 3.42 billion euros on sales of
11.38 billion euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of  France Telecom  dropped 0.3 percent to 11.45 euros
in Paris trading yesterday. The stock had declined 29 percent in
the 12 months through yesterday, trailing peers such as  Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD) ,  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  Telefonica SA (TEF) . The  Bloomberg
Europe Telecommunication Services index  declined 15 percent in
the same period.  The French operator, which competes with  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s SFR,
has a dividend yield of 12.2 percent based on yesterday’s
closing price, compared with an industry average of 7.8 percent.  France Telecom may spend about $2 billion to buy most of
billionaire Naguib Sawiris’s stake in their Egyptian wireless
venture and delist the operator. The company this month reached
a preliminary agreement with Sawiris’s Orascom Telecom Media &
Technology Holding SAE over Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services,
the operator known as Mobinil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
