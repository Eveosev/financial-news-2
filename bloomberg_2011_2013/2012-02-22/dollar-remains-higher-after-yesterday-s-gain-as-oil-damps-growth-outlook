The euro advanced to the strongest
level in more than 10 weeks against the dollar as a report
showed German business confidence rose to the highest level in
seven months amid progress taming the region’s debt crisis.  The dollar dropped after U.S. initial jobless claims held
at a four-year low, damping the search for safety. The yen rose
against the dollar after the sale of seven-year Treasury notes
was met with stronger-than-average demand. Higher-yielding
currencies appreciated as a measure of volatility among Group of
Seven currencies dropped to the lowest in more than three years.  “What’s happening is that European financial institutions
seem to be fairly robust,” said Steven Englander, head of Group
of 10 currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in  New York . “From a
market’s viewpoint, it’s very important, and that’s what’s
driving the euro.”  The euro strengthened 0.9 percent to $1.3373 at 5 p.m. New
York time, after reaching $1.3379, the most since Dec. 12. It
advanced 0.6 percent to 106.98 yen and gained 0.4 percent to
84.94 British pence. The yen rose 0.4 percent to 80 against the
dollar, snapping a five-day losing streak that was its longest
in 10 months.  The euro extended its gain against the dollar after it
broke above a key level of $1.3350, according to Jens Nordvig, a
managing director of currency research in New York at Nomura
Holdings Inc.  Euro-Dollar Pain  “We had a pretty important level at $1.3350 and stops are
being taken out,” said Nordvig. “I wouldn’t be surprised if
some people are going to take risk off the table. The pain is
the biggest in euro-dollar.”  The shared currency traded above its 100-day moving average
of $1.3308 today for the first time since Oct. 31.  Higher-yielding currencies, led by  South Africa ’s rand and
 New Zealand ’s dollar, rallied against their U.S. and Japanese
counterparts as stocks and crude oil rose. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index added 0.4 percent.  The rand rose 1 percent to 7.6599 per dollar and 0.6
percent to 10.44 yen. The  New Zealand dollar  appreciated 0.8
percent to 83.63 U.S. cents and 0.5 percent to 66.90 yen.  The euro gained as Munich-based Ifo institute said its
 business climate index  climbed to 109.6 from 108.3 in January,
the highest reading since July, amid efforts to prevent a
default by Greece.  The 17-nation currency stayed higher even after the
European Commission forecast of a shrinking euro-zone economy in
2012, with  Italy  and  Spain  facing sudden crunches as they battle
to escape the debt crisis. The euro bloc will contract 0.3
percent, the commission said, abandoning a November forecast of
0.5 percent growth. The downgrade was mainly due to projected
contractions of 1.3 percent in Italy and 1 percent in Spain.  ‘Key Challenge’  Further euro gains may be limited as the  Institute of
International Finance  said in its February Global Economic
Monitor that an orderly resolution of the Greek debt crisis
“remains a key challenge.” There is the “risk of a subsequent
debt restructuring,” following the pending private-sector
involvement deal, according to the IIF, which has been
negotiating on behalf of private creditors in talks with  Greece .  Applications for U.S. jobless benefits were unchanged in
the week ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, the fewest since March 2008,
Labor Department figures showed today. The median projection in
a Bloomberg News survey called for 355,000 claims, marking the
fourth straight week that the figures have been better than
forecast. The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls
dropped to the lowest level since August 2008.  ‘Well-Received Auction’  At today’s  seven-year  auction, the notes drew a yield of
1.418 percent, compared with a forecast of 1.456 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of 11 of the  Federal Reserve ’s primary
dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
3.11, compared with an average of 2.81 for the previous 10
sales.  “A very well-received auction has pushed  interest rates  a
bit lower,” said Robert Sinche, global head of currency
strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“The reaction of the dollar weakening against the yen and the
euro is consistent with that decline in medium-term interest
rates.”  Implied volatility  of three-month options on Group of Seven
currencies as tracked by the JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index fell
as low as 9.76 percent today, the least since August 2008. A
lower figure makes investments in currencies with higher
benchmark lending rates more attractive as the risk in such
trades is that market moves will erase profits.  Brazil’s Dealing  Brazil ’s real dropped for the first time in four days,
falling 0.5 percent to 1.7137 per dollar, after earlier touching
1.6967, the strongest since Oct. 31.  It weakened after the nation’s central bank bought dollars
in the forwards market a day after intervening in the  spot
market  to stem the currency’s 9.2 percent three-month rally.  The central bank today sold 3,500 reverse-currency-swap
contracts due in July and rejected all bids on contracts due in
April. The bank bought dollars in the spot market yesterday for
1.7083 reais.  Crude oil for April delivery rose 2.5 percent to $108.60 in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  today
after advancing to $108.74, the highest level since May 5.  The surge helped the currencies of Norway and  Canada , both
oil exporters, gain.  The krone rose 0.6 percent to 5.6150 per dollar and the
loonie, as Canada’s currency is known, added 0.2 percent to
99.75 Canadian cents per  U.S. dollar . The krone fell 0.3 percent
to 7.5087 per euro after appreciating as much as 0.7 percent to
7.4371, the strongest level since January 2003.  “The risk is that the next big worry wart is going to be
this continued strength in  oil prices ,” said Ray Attrill, a
senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York. “It
could undermine some of the current growth optimism.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
