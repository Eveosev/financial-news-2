New York Mets manager Terry Collins
said he expects left-hander  Johan Santana  to be ready for
opening day, even if the former Cy Young Award winner isn’t
ready to make such a prediction.  “In my mind right now, in my heart, he will be ready,”
Collins told reporters yesterday at the Mets’ spring training
camp in Port St. Lucie,  Florida . “I don’t think there’s any
question. He is gearing himself up to be ready.”  Santana, 32, who threw 30 pitches in a bullpen session
yesterday, hasn’t pitched in a Major League Baseball game since
September 2010 left shoulder surgery. He won the American League
Cy Young Award in 2004 and 2006 with the Minnesota Twins, before
being traded to the Mets in February 2008.  “I’m approaching everything one day at a time,” Santana
told reporters. “I’ve got to get the first (start) out of the
way and build my way up -- get my way up to 28, 30 whatever it
is.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
