Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-
largest maker of luxury cars, reduced the compensation of Chief
Executive Officer  Dieter Zetsche  even after posting record
profit in 2011.  Zetsche’s reward for 2011 is currently calculated at 8.65
million euros ($11.5 million), including fixed salary, bonuses
and long-term stock options, down from 8.69 million euros for
2010, Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler said today in its annual
report. Zetsche’s base salary rose to 2.01 million euros from
1.53 million euros.  The executive’s compensation for 2011 could increase if
Daimler performs better than planned in the coming years. A
bonus, which Daimler values at 2.04 million euros, will be paid
next year and could fall or rise depending on the stock’s
performance compared with other auto companies. A stock-option
program, valued at 2.57 million euros, will be disbursed in four
years based on how the company’s earnings and shares fare.  Daimler, which is also the world’s largest maker of heavy-
duty vehicles, reported record net income of 6.03 billion euros
in 2011, 29 percent more than the previous year. Still,
Mercedes-Benz fell to third in luxury-car sales behind
 Volkswagen AG (VOW3) ’s Audi, prompting Zetsche to vow to retake the
segment’s top spot from  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) .  Zetsche’s contract expires at the end of 2013 after the
carmaker extended it by three years in February 2010. The
highest-paid board member after Zetsche was Chief Financial
Officer Bodo Uebber, whose total compensation was 3.68 million
euros, down from 3.69 million euros for 2010.  Pay for the entire  management board , which was expanded to
seven last year with the addition of Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt
to oversee legal and compliance issues, rose to 28 million euros
in 2011 from 25 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
