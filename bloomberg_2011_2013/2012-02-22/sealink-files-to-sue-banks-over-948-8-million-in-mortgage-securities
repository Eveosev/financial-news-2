Sealink Funding Ltd., an Ireland-
based investment firm, took legal action against banks including
 Royal Bank of Scotland  and Credit Suisse over $948.8 million in
residential mortgage-backed securities.  Sealink said the banks, which also include  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) ,  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,
misrepresented underwriting standards in the offering materials
for the securities, according to a filing yesterday in state
court in New York.  “The offering materials also contained material
misrepresentations and omissions regarding key statistical
characteristics of the mortgage loans underlying the
securities,” Sealink said.  Banks such as Credit Suisse acquire mortgage loans from the
issuers and bundle them into securities that are sold to
investors and firms such as Sealink. Sealink said it was
established to receive, hold and manage residential mortgage-
backed securities.  Sealink seeks at least $948.8 million in damages.  The case is Sealink v. Royal Bank of  Scotland , 650484-2012,
State Supreme Court of the state of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
