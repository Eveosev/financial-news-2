Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russiaâ€™s most popular
search engine, said profit in the fourth quarter rose 50 percent
as rising Internet use boosted ad sales.  Adjusted net income reached 2.2 billion rubles ($74
million) from 1.47 billion rubles in the same period a year
earlier, the company said in a statement distributed to
reporters in Moscow today. Revenue climbed 56 percent to 6.44
billion rubles.  Yandex expects sales this year to increase 40 percent to 45
percent from the 20 billion rubles reached in 2011, which was a
60 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
