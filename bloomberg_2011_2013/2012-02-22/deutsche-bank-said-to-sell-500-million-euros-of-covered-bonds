Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  plans to sell 500
million euros of seven-year covered bonds, according to a banker
with knowledge of the transaction.  The notes may be priced at a yield in the mid to high 20
basis-point area more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, the
banker said.  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , Natixis and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are
managing the sale with Deutsche Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
