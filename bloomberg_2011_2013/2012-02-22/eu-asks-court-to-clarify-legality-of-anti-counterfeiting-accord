The European Union said it will
refer the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement to the  European
Court  of Justice to clarify the accord’s legality.  “We are planning to ask  Europe ’s highest court to assess
whether ACTA is incompatible in any way with the EU’s
fundamental rights and freedoms,” European Trade Commissioner
Karel De Gucht told reporters today in Brussels. The accord is
intended to bolster the global fight against counterfeiting and
piracy, including illegal file sharing on the internet.  ACTA has been the subject of protests across the EU since
the text was signed in Tokyo on Jan. 26 because of concerns that
it may harm freedom of expression and information sharing
online. In addition to the EU, signatory countries include the
U.S.,  Japan  and South Korea. The accord needs to be ratified by
all 27 EU governments before it can come into effect.  “It’s very important that the European Court of Justice
gives us guidance” on ACTA,  De Gucht  said.  “Intellectual property is Europe’s main raw material,” he
said. “The problem is that we currently struggle to protect it
outside the European Union.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
