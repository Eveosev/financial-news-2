Fairfax Media Ltd. (FXJ) ,  Australia ’s
largest newspaper publisher after  News Corp. (NWSA) , doubled its cost
cutting target to A$170 million ($181 million) after first-half
profit fell 44 percent.  Net income dropped to A$96.7 million in the six months
ended Dec. 25 from A$172.3 million a year earlier, the company
said in a statement today. The result lagged the A$135 million
average of three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald will share more
content across its outlets such as radio, newspapers and
Internet to lower costs as it battles a slide in revenues amid
falling circulation. Fairfax will also eliminate duplication by
centralizing sales functions for advertising.  “Large parts of our current operating model are still
geared to supporting the old business model,” Chief Executive
Officer Greg Hywood said in the statement. “The difficult
trading environment is likely to continue and the outlook
remains uncertain.”  Trading revenue in January was 7.5 percent lower than the
previous year, the company said.  Fairfax  shares  fell 0.6 percent to 82 Australian cents at
the close in Sydney. The stock has gained 14 percent this year.  Fairfax also publishes the Australian Financial Review and
Age newspapers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
