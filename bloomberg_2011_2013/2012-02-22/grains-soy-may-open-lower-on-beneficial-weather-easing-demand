What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that rising global
supplies will damp demand for U.S. exports,  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa,
said in a telephone interview. Precipitation in the next two
weeks may boost prospects for U.S. yields, he said,  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago as rain in South America aids developing crops,
while two U.S. Midwest snowstorms in the next week increase
soil-moisture reserves before the planting season that begins in
April, Roose said.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT on speculation that rain will boost crops in Brazil and
 Argentina , reducing demand for U.S. supplies, Roose said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.15 cent to 0.2 cent a
pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open down 50 cents to
$1 per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
