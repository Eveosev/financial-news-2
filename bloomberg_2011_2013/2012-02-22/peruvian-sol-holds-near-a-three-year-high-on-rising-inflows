Peru’s sol held near a three-year
high as the country’s metal exporters bought the currency to pay
local taxes and amid rising investment inflows to the country.  The sol was little changed at 2.68 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close of trading in  Lima , according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit. The currency yesterday touched 2.679, its highest intraday
level since at least December 2008.  The central bank purchased $133 million in the foreign
exchange market today and has bought $1.95 billion so far this
month to stem gains in the sol. It paid an average 2.68 soles
per dollar today, the bank said on its website.  “The structural supply of dollars in the first quarter
makes the sol immune to bad news abroad,” said Gonzalo Navarro,
head trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima.  While foreign investment flows and companies bringing in
dollars to pay taxes for March push gains in the sol, the
central bank’s dollar purchases are easing the strengthening
trend, according to Navarro. He forecasts the sol will gain to
2.665 by the end of March.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.55 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.09 centimo to 115.31 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
