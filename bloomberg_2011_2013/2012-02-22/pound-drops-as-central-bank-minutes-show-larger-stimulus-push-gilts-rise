The pound fell to a more than 10-
week low against the euro after a German report showed business
confidence climbed to the highest level in seven months.  Sterling fell for a fourth day against  Europe ’s shared
currency, the longest run of declines in five months, before a
report tomorrow forecast to confirm the U.K. economy contracted
in the fourth quarter. Gilts declined as stock gains damped
demand for safer investments.  “People are more likely to trade risk if they think the
acute phase of the euro crisis is moving behind us,” which is
boosting the euro against the pound, said  Gavin Friend , a
markets strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in  London .
“The U.K. economy isn’t fantastic, it is still below trend.”  Sterling weakened 0.2 percent to 84.71 pence per euro at
10:45 a.m. London time after depreciating to 84.89 pence, the
least since Dec. 12. The pound climbed 0.3 percent to $1.5716,
trimming yesterday’s 0.7 percent decline.  The Munich-based Ifo institute’s business climate index,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 109.6 this
month from 108.3 in January. That’s the highest reading since
July. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg news predicted an
increase to 108.8.  Pound Weakness  The pound has fallen 1.9 percent against the euro this week
after  Greece  won 130 billion euros ($173 billion) in aid,
fueling optimism policy makers are containing contagion from the
sovereign debt crisis.  Sterling slumped yesterday after minutes of this month’s
Bank of England meeting showed two policy makers voted for a
larger increase in asset purchases than the amount agree upon.
Policy makers  Adam Posen  and  David Miles  wanted a 75 billion-
pound boost in quantitative easing, instead of the 50 billion
pounds supported by the other seven policy makers.  An index of U.K. factory orders rose to minus 13 from minus
16 in January, according to a Bloomberg News survey before the
Confederation of British Industry report today.  The pound has dropped 1.1 percent in the past week
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. That extends its one-year loss
to 4.6 percent, the indexes show.  The yield on the benchmark  10-year gilt  climbed two basis
points to 2.13 percent. The 3.75 percent bond due in September
2021 fell 0.215, or 2.15 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
113.915. Two-year  yields  were little changed at 0.4 percent.  The FTSE 100 Index of shares rose 0.2 percent.  U.K. gilts have handed investors a 1.5 percent loss this
year, after returning almost 17 percent in 2011, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German debt lost 0.2 percent,
while  U.S. Treasuries  fell 0.5 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
