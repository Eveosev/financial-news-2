The following is a reformatted
version of a statement by Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  released by her office by e-mail today on the
announcement by  Kevin Rudd  of his resignation as foreign
minister.  “Today Kevin Rudd has tendered his resignation as Minister
for Foreign Affairs.  Mr. Rudd was a strong and effective advocate for
Australia’s interests overseas.  During his period of service as Foreign Minister there were
many achievements. He strongly pursued Australia’s interests in
the world.  I am disappointed that the concerns Mr. Rudd has publicly
expressed this evening were never personally raised with me, nor
did he contact me to discuss his resignation prior to his
decision.  I plan to hold a press conference tomorrow to make a
further statement.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
