Pork stockpiles in the U.S. rose 8.5
percent at the end of January from a year earlier as production
increased, the government said.  Warehouses held 584.4 million pounds of the meat, up from
 538.8 million  on Jan. 31, 2011, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories were up 21
percent from the end of December.  U.S. commercial pork  output  last year totaled 22.8 billion
pounds (10.3 million metric tons), up 1.4 percent from 2010, the
USDA said. On Jan. 11, wholesale- pork  prices reached 83.12 cents
a pound, the lowest since in almost a year, and wholesale-ham
 prices  declined 6 percent last month, the fourth straight drop,
government data show.  “Late 2011 and early 2012 production was quite large,
thereby implying an excess of pork available,”  Dan Vaught , the
owner of Vaught Futures Insights in Altus,  Arkansas , said in an
e-mailed report before the USDA numbers were released.
“Finally, my sources indicate hams didn’t sell very well during
the year-end holiday season, with some stores reportedly forced
to feature hams again in January to get them sold.”  Hog futures for April settlement rose 0.9 percent to 90.65
cents a pound at 12:54 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Before today, the price gained 6.6 percent this year.  As of Jan. 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, rose 4.6 percent from a year earlier
to 53.7 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham fell 1.1 percent from a year earlier to 100.4
million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of January were 21
percent smaller than a year earlier at 609.8 million pounds, the
USDA said. Beef supplies climbed 4.4 percent to 482.1 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
