Syrian dissidents formed an
opposition group including minority Alawites, Turkmens, Yezidis
and Druse, saying they weren’t represented in the main
organization challenging President Bashar al-Assad, Hurriyet
Daily News reported.  The National Change Movement is led by  Ammar Qurabi , head
of the Syrian National Organization for Human Rights, who told
the Istanbul-based newspaper in an  interview  that the bloc is
the first opposition party that isn’t Islamist. He said that the
Syrian National Council, the main alliance against Assad,
excluded minorities, and that having only one opposition group
would replicate the monopoly of Assad’s Baath Party.  Opposition to Assad also includes local coordinating
committees in Syria and the Free Syrian Army, whose commanders
are in a refugee camp in  Turkey . The Syrian opposition didn’t
get “strong support” from the  United Nations , the Arab League
or Turkey until now, Qurabi told Hurriyet, adding that his
alliance supports the creation of a buffer zone in  Syria . It
also plans to open an office in Istanbul, where the national
council already has one, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
