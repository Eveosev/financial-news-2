Namibia ’s central bank kept its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for a seventh consecutive
meeting to help boost economic growth.  The repo rate was left at 6 percent, Bank of Namibia
Governor Ipumbu Shiimi told reporters today in the capital,
Windhoek. The bank has held the rate unchanged since December
2010.  “The monetary policy committee is of the view that a
tightening of the monetary policy stance at this stage might be
premature and thus detrimental to growth prospects,” he said.  Economic growth in Namibia, the world’s biggest miner of
offshore diamonds and the fourth-largest producer of uranium,
probably slowed to 3.8 percent last year from 6.6 percent in
2010, Shiimi said.  “The slowed growth reflects weaknesses in the mining
sector, which incurred production losses due to prolonged
industrial actions, flooding at the mines and logistical
constraints,” he said. Other industries including construction,
communications and transport recorded positive growth, he said.  The southern African nation’s inflation rate fell to 6.6
percent in January from a 2 ½-year high of 7.2 percent a month
earlier, the statistics office said on Feb. 14. Inflation may
accelerate this year, though it will remain below 10 percent,
Shiimi said.  The rates decision is in line with the central bank of
neighboring  South Africa , which kept its benchmark rate at 5.5
percent last month. Namibia’s currency is pegged to the South
African rand and the central bank generally follows monetary
policy set by the South African Reserve Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
