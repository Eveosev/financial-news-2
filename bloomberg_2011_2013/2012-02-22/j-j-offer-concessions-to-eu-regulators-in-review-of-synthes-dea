Johnson & Johnson offered
concessions to European Union antitrust regulators who are
reviewing its plan to buy  Synthes Inc. (SYST)  in a deal valued at about
$18.89 billion.  The European Commission extended its deadline to rule on
the deal until April 26, it said in a filing on its website
today. The regulator didn’t give any details of what concessions
J&J offered.  J&J, the world’s second-largest seller of health products,
defended its bid to buy Synthes, a maker of medical tools to
treat damaged bones, at a Feb. 14 hearing with EU regulators. A
hearing usually follows a formal antitrust complaint listing EU
concerns that a deal may harm competition.  In November, the Brussels-based regulator opened an
expanded probe of the deal, which would make J&J the leader in
the $5.5 billion market for devices used to treat trauma
victims. The EU said its initial investigation showed that the
transaction may trigger an increase in prices for orthopedic
medical devices.  J&J’s offer for Synthes is the biggest purchase in the  New
Brunswick , New Jersey-based company’s 125-year history. A phone
call and e-mail  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s press office didn’t get an
immediate response outside of normal business hours. Gilgian
Eisner, a spokesman for  West Chester , Pennsylvania-based
Synthes, declined to comment.  Antoine Colombani, spokesman for  Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s
antitrust chief, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
