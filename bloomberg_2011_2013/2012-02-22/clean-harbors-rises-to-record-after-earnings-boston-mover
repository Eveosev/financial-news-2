Clean Harbors Inc. (CLH) , a provider of
waste-management services, rose after reporting earnings that
exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Clean Harbors increased 5.9 percent to $69.44 at the close
in New York, the biggest gain since November. The company, based
in Norwell,  Massachusetts , today reported fourth-quarter
earnings of 72 cents a share, beating the average estimate of 49
cents of seven analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The company had revenue of $545.9 million, compared with
$417.1 million a year earlier. Analysts had estimated revenue of
$506.8 million. Annual sales increased to $1.98 billion from
$1.73 billion in 2010.  “Our growth was driven by a combination of our 2011
acquisitions and double-digit organic growth in the quarter,”
Chief Executive Officer Alan McKim said in a company statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
