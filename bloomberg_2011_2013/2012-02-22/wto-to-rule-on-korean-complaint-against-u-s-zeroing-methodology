The  World Trade Organization  agreed
today to decide whether the U.S. use of so-called zeroing to
calculate anti-dumping duties on some South Korean steel
products violates global trade rules.  South Korea  filed a request for consultations in January
2011 over the U.S. use of zeroing in anti-dumping calculations
on Korean corrosion-resistant carbon steel flat products. The
WTO has ruled several times against the methodology, under which
the U.S. sets the cost of a product at zero rather than the
actual amount, saying it unfairly increases the amount of anti-
dumping duty that that must be paid.  The U.S. announced earlier this month that it had signed an
agreement with the European Union and  Japan  to end their
longstanding disputes over zeroing. Dumping occurs when
companies export goods at a loss, or at prices below what the
products fetch in their domestic market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
