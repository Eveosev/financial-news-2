Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  tumbled the most in almost a month in Czech trading after
the television broadcaster said its fourth-quarter loss widened.  The stock slumped 6.7 percent, the most since Jan. 24 on an
intraday basis, to 155 koruna by 9:28 a.m. in Prague. That was
the biggest drop in the  PX (PX)  equity index today, which declined
0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
