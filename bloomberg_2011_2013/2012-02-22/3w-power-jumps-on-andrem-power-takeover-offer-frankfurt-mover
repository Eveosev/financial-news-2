3W Power SA, the holding company
that owns German maker of solar inverters AEG Power Solutions,
 jumped  the most since the shares were listed in 2008 after
Andrem Power SCA offered to buy the company for 4.35 euros
($5.76), or 38 percent more than yesterday’s closing price.  3W Power gained as much as much as 35 percent to 4.28
euros. The shares advanced 1.01 euros, or 32 percent, to 4.17
euros as of 10:45 a.m., valuing the Luxembourg-based company at
210 million euros.  Andrem Power, indirectly owned by private-equity firm
 Nordic Capital Ltd , is bidding 38 percent more than 3W’s closing
price on Feb. 21, a premium that corresponds to about 40 percent
more than the volume-weighted average share price of the past
three months, 3W said  in a statement .  “We see 3W Power as a well-positioned platform in power
management and energy efficiency products as well as in the
renewable energy market with strong growth prospects,´´ Soenke
Baestlein, Partner at NC Advisory, who acted as an adviser to
Nordic Capital Funds, said in the statement.  The transaction is subject to 95 percent of 3W  shareholders 
accepting the offer, and Andrem Power plans to force out any
remaining shareholders and delist the company. 3W’s  management 
board said it welcomes the offer, and shareholders representing
about 65 percent of shares have agreed to accept it. The
transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012,
3W said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
