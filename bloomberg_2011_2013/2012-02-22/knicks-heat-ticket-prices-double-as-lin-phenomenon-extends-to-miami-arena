The Jeremy Lin road show is about to
begin, doubling ticket prices as the  New York Knicks  visit the
 Miami Heat  tomorrow.  The Knicks, who are 8-2 since Lin thrust himself into the
spotlight by coming off the bench to score 25 points in a Feb. 4
win against New Jersey, end a five-game home stand tonight
against the  Atlanta Hawks . They then will play five of the
following six on the road, also taking a six-day layoff for the
All-Star break after the game tomorrow night at AmericanAirlines
Arena in Miami.  The average resale ticket price to the Heat game is $510,
more than double the $219 average price for Miami’s other
contests this season, according to  TiqIQ , an event ticket
aggregator for the online resale market.  The highest-priced seat to watch the Knicks take on Heat
All-Stars LeBron James,  Dwyane Wade  and Chris Bosh is going for
$9,400, according to TiqIQ, while the average price has more
than doubled since the day after Lin, a second-year National
Basketball Association player, made his first career start on
Feb. 6.  Lin, the first Harvard University graduate to play in the
NBA since  Ed Smith  in 1953-54 and the first Chinese- or
Taiwanese-American to play in the league, has averaged 24.6
points and 8.5 assists per contest during the 10-game stretch,
sending ticket prices, television ratings and international
interest in his story soaring. The attention has come to be
known as “Linsanity.”  The 23-year-old Lin never got in the lineup during New
York’s first game at the Heat, a 99-89 loss on Jan. 27 that drew
19,707 fans, fewer than the team’s current average of 19,918 a
game.  Hawks Tickets  Ticket prices for  New York ’s game tonight against the Hawks
(19-13) at Madison Square Garden are averaging $565, 73 percent
higher than the team’s $326 season average, according to TiqIQ.  Lin will play in the All-Star Rising Stars Challenge on
Feb. 24, two days before teammate Carmelo Anthony starts the
All-Star Game in Orlando.  The Knicks host the  Cleveland Cavaliers  on Feb. 29 and then
play four straight road games: at the  Boston Celtics , defending
NBA champion Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs and Milwaukee
Bucks.  New York is 16-17, four games behind the Atlantic Division-
leading Philadelphia 76ers. The Heat are 26-7, five games in
front of the Orlando Magic in the Southeast Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
