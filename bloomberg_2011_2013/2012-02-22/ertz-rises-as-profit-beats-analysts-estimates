Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) , the
largest publicly traded U.S. auto-rental chain, rose the most in
more than two months after reporting profit that exceeded
analysts’ estimates as it lowered costs and boosted sales.  The shares rose 5.1 percent to $14.29 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since Dec. 16. They have risen 22 percent
this year.  Fourth-quarter  profit  was $47.1 million, or 11 cents a
share, compared with a loss of $28.1 million, or 7 cents, a year
earlier, the  Park Ridge , New Jersey-based company said in a
statement today. Excluding some items, profit was 24 cents a
share. Five analysts in a Bloomberg survey had, on average,
estimated profit of 20 cents.  Sales rose 9.7 percent to $2.01 billion, compared with the
$1.99 billion average of five  analysts’ estimates . Operating
expense as a portion of revenue fell to 52.5 percent from 56.4
percent in the quarter.  Hertz said profit this year would be $1.16 to $1.26 a
share, on sales of as much as $8.95 billion. Analysts were
predicting profit of $1.22 a share on sales of $8.90 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
