Ethanol rose as gasoline rallied to
the highest level since July after officials from the
 International Atomic Energy Agency  were denied access to an
Iranian military base.  The biofuel gained 0.8 percent as gasoline climbed 0.6
percent. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to augment supply and
meet federal mandates.  “Ethanol is following its big brother, gasoline,” Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk Management Inc. in  Dallas ,
said by phone. “Gasoline has been definitely on a mission since
the market realized that the refining capacity was going to be
greatly reduced.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery climbed 1.7 cents to
$2.201 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the  Gulf Coast  added 1
cent to $2.235 a gallon and New York prices gained 1 cent to
$2.25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol in
Chicago climbed 1 cent to $2.185 a gallon and on the West Coast
added 1 cent to $2.305.  March-delivery gasoline rose 1.75 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $3.0877 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the highest price since July 29. Gasoline has gained 15 percent
this year.  Sunoco Inc. and ConocoPhillips shut unprofitable refineries
in the Philadelphia area late last year, and Sunoco has said it
will close another plant if it can’t attract a buyer by July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
