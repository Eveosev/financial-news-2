U.S. 10-year note yields approached
a one-month high before an industry report that economists said
will show sales of existing homes increased for a fourth month,
damping demand for the safest securities.  Five-year debt held three days of losses as the government
prepared to auction $35 billion of the securities today, part of
$99 billion of notes it is selling this week. European finance
ministers approved a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion) aid package
for Greece yesterday, reducing the appetite of investors for
haven assets.  “There’s still this upward push from the economic side”
for Treasury yields, said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London . “The healing process is
ongoing and so from a pure level perspective, 10-year yields at
the vicinity of 2 percent are not that appropriate on a long-
term basis.”  The 10-year note yielded 2.07 percent at 10:09 a.m. London
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
bond due in February 2022 fell 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 13/32. The yield climbed to 2.08 percent earlier
today, the highest since Jan. 24.  Sales of existing U.S. homes rose to an annual rate of 4.66
million in January, from 4.61 million the previous month, based
on a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the National
Association of Realtors’ report today.  Treasuries dropped yesterday as the approval of  Greece ’s
bailout package reduced demand for the U.S. government’s $35
billion auction of two-year notes. Investors bid for 3.54 times
the amount of available debt, down from 3.75 in January.  The five-year notes being sold today yielded 0.94 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.899 percent at the
previous offering on Jan. 25. The record low for the monthly
sales was 0.88 percent in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
