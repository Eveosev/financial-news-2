Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil
producer, said crude-producing licenses operated by  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  will be renewed within a month as it
concludes a review of expired or soon-to-lapse leases.  “We will renew the expired licenses before the end of
March,” Austen Oniwon, group managing director of state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., said at a conference in
Abuja, the capital.  The West Africa nation signed a deal today with  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  to renew for 20 years oil leases 67, 68 and 70, which
together produce about 550,000 barrels a day, Mark Ward,
managing director of Exxon’s Nigerian unit, told reporters.  Negotiations for 16 oil blocks operated by companies
including Exxon, Shell and Chevron have been under way for over
two years. Shell is “optimistic” about the process and the
“sooner the renewals, the better,” Mutiu Sunmonu, the
company’s chairman for Nigeria, said at the conference.  Nigeria is the fifth-biggest source of U.S. crude imports.
Shell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron,  Total SA (FP)  and  Eni SpA (ENI)  operate joint
ventures with Nigerian National Petroleum that pump about 90
percent of the country’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
