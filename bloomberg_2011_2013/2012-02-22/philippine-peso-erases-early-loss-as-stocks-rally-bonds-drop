The Philippine peso erased losses
after the stock market rallied and the central bank signaled it
has room to support economic growth even amid higher  oil prices .  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  climbed 0.7 percent
after losing 0.9 percent yesterday. The peso earlier dropped as
much as 0.5 percent on concern rising fuel costs will re-ignite
inflation and as a second bailout for Greece failed to bolster
confidence among investors over the state of euro-area finances.  “With the stock market up, this helped the market
stabilize,” said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president of
financial markets at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “When the
day started market concerns were oil prices and the Greece
situation.”  The peso closed at 42.630 per dollar in Manila, compared
with 42.645 yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency earlier touched 42.875, the lowest level in almost a
week. The yield on the government’s 5.875 percent bonds due
February 2032 increased seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 6.06 percent, according to noon fixing prices from
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  Crude reached a nine-month high of $106.41 a barrel in  New
York  today due to the threat of a disruption to supplies from
 Iran . Consumer prices in the  Philippines  rose at the slowest
pace in January in more than a year, providing room for the
central bank to cut  interest rates . The Southeast Asian nation
buys almost all its oil requirement from overseas.  Inflation Target  “Our assessment is, under specific stressed oil price
levels, inflation would be elevated but the full-year inflation
average would be within target,” central bank Governor Amando
Tetangco said in an e-mail today. The official inflation target
this year is 3 percent to 5 percent  Consumer prices climbed 3.9 percent last month from a year
earlier, slowing from 4.2 percent in December, official data
show. The inflation rate reached 5.2 percent in October and June,
the highest since April 2009. Policy makers lowered borrowing
costs on Jan. 19 by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point,
to 4.25 percent.  European officials awarded 130 billion euros ($172 billion)
in aid to  Greece  this week after it signed up to a program of
austerity and economic reforms that threaten to intensify street
protests, with unemployment running at almost 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
