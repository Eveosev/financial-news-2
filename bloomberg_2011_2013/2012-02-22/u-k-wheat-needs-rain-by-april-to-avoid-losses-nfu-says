U.K. wheat that’s in the ground and
barley soon to be planted need rain by April to prevent
potential yield losses, said Guy Gagen, the chief crop adviser
at the National Farmers Union.  Drought has persisted in parts of 16 counties in East
Anglia, the Midlands and southeast  England , the Environment
Agency said on Feb. 20. Shropshire and Nottinghamshire in the
Midlands are also being affected by dry weather, it said, adding
that soil is too dry to recharge plants.  “Crops had enough rain to get them established in the
autumn,” Gagen said today at the union’s conference in
Birmingham. “At the moment, it’s drier than it should be, but
the crops are looking fine because they have enough moisture on
the surface. What we have now is a risk going into the spring
and the summer that they may run out of water.”  Wheat is particularly at risk if it doesn’t rain, Gagen
said, adding barley planting would also suffer. Nearly every
county not on the west coast is suffering from dry conditions,
he said.  “Wheat is the one that’s most vulnerable. Of course, we
have the establishment of spring cropping to come. People are
just starting to plant barley and a number are starting to plant
maize and they may not establish well if it remains dry.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
