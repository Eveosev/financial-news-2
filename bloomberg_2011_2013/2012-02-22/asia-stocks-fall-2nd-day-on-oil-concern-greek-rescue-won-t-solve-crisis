Asian  stocks  rose ahead of U.S.
housing market data that may add to signs the world’s largest
economy is recovering, and as Japanese exporters gained on a
weaker yen.  Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688)  surged in  Hong Kong .  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which gets almost 30 percent of its
sales from North America, rose 1.8 percent in Tokyo as the yen
slid to 80 against the dollar for the first time since Aug. 4.
Alibaba, China’s No. 1 e-commerce web portal, jumped 43 percent
after its parent offered to privatize the company. Agile
Property Holdings Ltd., a Chinese developer, jumped 7.2 percent
in Hong Kong on speculation Shanghai will relax property curbs.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 0.1 percent to 127.8 as
of 8:48 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge rose the past nine weeks, the
longest such streak since December 2005, amid signs the  U.S.
economy  is improving, bets  China  will ease monetary policy and
optimism  Europe  will contain the region’s debt crisis. The
shares trade at 14.8 times estimated earnings, up from 12.6 on
Dec. 16, when the streak began.  “Strength in the U.S. economy and emerging markets’
monetary policies leading to soft-landings are the two pillars
supporting the market,” said Shintaro Takeuchi, portfolio
investment group manager at Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire
Insurance Co., which oversees $109 billion in assets. “ Greece 
remains a risk factor, but that has already been priced in and
it won’t have much impact on the market unless it actually
defaults. Stocks are likely to be solid for the next few
months.”  Small Cap Streak  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 1 percent after
swinging between gains and losses. A gauge of  smaller companies 
listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose for a 27th straight day,
its longest streak of gains since 1961. Kagetsuenkanko Co.,
which manages resort hotels and restaurants, rose the most in
the measure of companies on Tokyo Stock Exchange’s so-called
second section, advancing 48 percent to 92 yen.  Toyota rose 1.8 percent to 3,380 yen, and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ,
Japan’s third-biggest carmaker by market value, climbed 2.3
percent to 814 yen after the yen fell to 80.08 against the
dollar today during market open. The yen weakened against the
greenback on speculation accelerating U.S. economic growth will
reduce the case for more quantitative easing from the  Federal
Reserve .  U.S. sales of previously owned homes probably rose last
month to the highest level since May 2010, based on the median
estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg. In Europe, a
second bailout for Greece may not be enough to end the debt
crisis, Bank of England Deputy Governor Charlie Bean said
yesterday.  South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 0.2 percent and Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed less than 0.1 percent. Hong Kong’s
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.3 percent. China’s manufacturing may
shrink for a fourth month in February as Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis damps exports and the housing market cools, a survey of
purchasing managers indicated.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9 percent after
the Shanghai Securities News reported Shanghai, the nation’s
financial center, eased some home purchase restrictions.  Agile jumped 7.2 percent to HK$10.60 in Hong Kong, while
 Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) , a mainland developer,
increased 5.1 percent to HK$4.91.  Crude Oil  Crude oil futures slid as much as 0.6 percent today from a
nine-month high, heading for the first decline in more than a
week as prices approached a technical resistance level. Oil for
April delivery yesterday advanced $2.65, or 2.6 percent, to
$106.25, the highest settlement since May 4.  Some shares declined amid concern oil near a nine-month
high will crimp economic growth.  Kumho Petro Chemical Co. (011780) , a
Korean maker of synthetic rubber and chemicals, sank 4.3 percent
to 167,000 won in Seoul. Air China Ltd., the world’s biggest
airline by market value, fell 1 percent to HK$5.96 in Hong Kong
on speculation fuel costs will rise.  “If oil prices remain high it will damp economic outlooks
and weigh on stocks,” said Tokio Marine’s Takeuchi.  Company Profits  Of 487 companies in the Asia-Pacific gauge that have
reported net income since Jan. 9, more than half have fallen
short of analysts’ estimates and profit has dropped 58 percent
on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with the U.S., where net income has grown an average of
5.3 percent for 399  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  companies that
have reported.  Alibaba soared 43 percent to HK$13.20, the  biggest gain  on
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, after its parent company Alibaba
Group Holding Ltd. bid as much as HK$19.6 billion ($2.5 billion)
to buy out minority shareholders.  OneSteel Ltd. (OST) , an Australian steelmaker, surged 16 percent
to 95 Australian cents in Sydney, extending yesterday’s jump
after saying it’s switching focus to iron ore away from its
loss-making steel unit.  Among stocks that fell,  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL) , the
world’s No. 1 palm-oil processing company, sank 11 percent to
S$5.22 in Singapore after the company said fourth-quarter profit
rose 57 percent from a year earlier to $500 million. That
compares with the $519.8 million average estimate of six
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
