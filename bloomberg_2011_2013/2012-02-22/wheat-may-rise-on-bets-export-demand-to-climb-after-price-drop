Wheat futures, little changed, may
rise on speculation that demand will gain after prices dropped
yesterday to a four-week low.  About 22.15 million bushels of U.S. wheat were inspected
for export in the week ended Feb. 16, up 17 percent from a week
earlier, the Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Wheat and
corn prices fell yesterday on speculation that the USDA will
report tomorrow that U.S. acreage will rise this year. Both
grains are used in livestock feed. Corn futures were up today in
early trading.  Prices “are maybe getting down into a zone where we’ll see
a little bit of demand pick up,”  Jason Britt , the president of
brokerage Central States Commodities Inc. in  Kansas City ,
 Missouri , said in a telephone interview. “One thing that would
help wheat is if corn would stabilize.”  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 0.25 cent to $6.365 a
bushel at 10:02 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Before
today, the commodity was down 4.4 percent this month.  U.S. farmers may plant 94.329 million acres of corn this
year, the most since 1944, and 57.233 million acres in wheat,
the most in three years, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
The USDA will release its first acreage forecasts for this
year’s crops tomorrow at its annual Outlook Forum in Arlington,
Virginia.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
