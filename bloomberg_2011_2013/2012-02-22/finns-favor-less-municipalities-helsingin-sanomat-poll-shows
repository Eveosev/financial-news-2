The majority of Finnish citizens
acknowledge the need for reducing the number of municipalities,
a poll by newspaper  Helsingin Sanomat  says.  The need for reform was recognized by 54 percent of
respondents, who considered an appropriate number of
municipalities to be around 150, the Helsinki-based newspaper
said, citing a poll by TNS Gallup Oy.  The government has proposed decreasing the number of
municipalities in continental  Finland  to around 70 from 320,
which only 16 percent of respondents approve. Finnish opposition
Center Party is filing a motion of no-confidence in government
over municipal merger plans today.  The poll had a margin of error of about 3 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
