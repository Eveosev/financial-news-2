Swiss stocks  retreated for a second
day after a report showed services and manufacturing output in
the euro area unexpectedly shrank this month.  Swiss Re Ltd. and  UBS AG (UBSN)  led financial shares lower, both
falling more than 2.5 percent.  Straumann Holding AG (STMN)  tumbled the
most in more than three years after profit missed estimates.
 Temenos Group AG (TEMN)  lost 5.7 percent after sales fell short of
forecasts.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , a measure of  Switzerland ’s biggest
and most actively traded companies, dropped 0.7 percent to
6,192.42 at the close in Zurich. The broader Swiss Performance
Index also slid 0.7 percent today.  “Industrial activity in the major European Union periphery
countries is in a contraction mode,” wrote Annalisa Piazza, a
London-based analyst at Newedge Group, in an e-mail to clients.
“It will take a while to see a self-sustaining improvement in
the manufacturing index.”  A euro-area  composite gauge  based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries dropped to 49.7 from 50.4 in
January, London-based Markit Economics said in an initial
estimate today. Economists had forecast a reading of 50.5,
according to a Bloomberg survey. A reading below 50 indicates
contraction.  Future of Greece  Swiss stocks yesterday slipped from a seven-month high
after  Greece ’s 130 billion-euro ($173 billion) bailout package
failed to ease investor concern that the debt crisis will be
contained. Bank of England Deputy Governor Charlie Bean said the
Greek deal, which includes a 53.5 percent writedown for
investors, may not be enough to end the crisis.  Swiss Re, which is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow,
dropped 2.7 percent to 53 francs. UBS, Switzerland’s largest
bank, lost 3.3 percent to 12.75 Swiss francs, while  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  fell 1.5 percent to 24.84 francs.  Elsewhere, Straumann tumbled 8.4 percent to 145.70 francs,
the most since November 2008, after the biggest maker of dental
implants reported 2011 profit that missed analyst estimates.  Net income dropped 46 percent to 71 million francs ($77.9
million) last year, below the 75.6 million-franc average
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company’s
margin forecast also missed some analysts estimates.  Nobel Biocare AG fell 3.9 percent to 10.98 francs in
Zurich.  Temenos dropped 5.7 percent to 16.5 francs after the
company late yesterday reported fourth-quarter revenue of $127
million, missing the average analyst estimate of $139.1 million.
The company said merger talks with Misys are continuing, one day
after buyout firm Vista Equity Partners made a competing cash
offer for the U.K. software maker.  Temenos reiterated its medium-term financial targets, while
it was unable to give 2012 forecasts due to its proposed merger
with Misys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
