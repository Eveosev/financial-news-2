German bunds advanced for the first
time in a week after European reports showed services and
manufacturing unexpectedly contracted this month, boosting
demand for the region’s safest securities.  Italian and Portuguese bonds dropped amid concern a planned
Greek debt-swap agreed by European finance ministers this week
will prove difficult to implement. Greek bonds declined after
 Fitch Ratings  cut the nation’s credit ranking by two levels and
said a default was “highly likely.”  Germany  sold 4.28 billion
euros ($5.67 billion) of new benchmark two-year notes.  “It’s a typical reaction to the risk off -- bunds rally and
Italy and  Spain  underperform,” said Achilleas Georgolopoulos, a
fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in
 London . “The market expected strong numbers and it came
weaker,” he said.  Germany’s 10-year yield fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 1.89 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
rising 12 basis points over the previous four days. The 2
percent bund maturing in January 2022 gained 0.805, or 8.05
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.96.  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing dropped to 49.7 from 50.4
in January, London-based Markit Economics said today in an
initial estimate. Economists forecast a reading of 50.5,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. A figure below 50
indicates contraction.  Italian Bonds  The yield on  Italy ’s 10-year bond increased eight basis
points to 5.51 percent after falling to 5.36 percent yesterday,
the lowest level since Sept. 9.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened 17 basis points
to 3.62 percentage points. The spread contracted to 3.37
yesterday, the narrowest since September.  Portuguese and Spanish bonds also underperformed bunds.
 Portugal’s (GSPT10YR)  10-year yield rose 12 basis points to 12.45 percent,
and its two-year yield jumped 90 basis points to 13.63 percent.
Spain’s 10-year yield was little changed at 5.09 percent.  Germany sold 0.25 percent notes due in March 2014 at an
 average yield  of 0.25 percent, compared with 0.17 percent at an
auction of similar-maturity debt on Jan. 18. The sale attracted
bids for 1.8 times the amount allocated to investors.  “Despite the very low level of yields, the demand was
significant and may be suggesting to the market that in this
session there is still a risk-off mode to exploit,” said  Matteo Regesta , a senior interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas SA in
London. “With two-year yields at 25 basis points a strong
result can be seen as a measure to gauge the risk-off mode.”  Greek Default  Greece ’s benchmark October 2022 bonds fell after Fitch said
a default was “highly likely in the near term” as it lowered
the nation’s credit rating to C from CCC.  The Greek government said yesterday it will introduce
legislation to Parliament for so-called collective action
clauses that will allow it to enforce losses on bondholders that
refuse the exchange.  “Collective action clauses by definition trigger a
selective default by the rating agencies,” Regesta said.  The yield on the October 2022 bonds increased 95 basis
points to 34.36 percent, and the price declined to 20.54 percent
of face value.  Volatility on Greek debt was among the highest in euro-area
markets after Germany, according to measures of 10-year bonds,
two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps. The
change in the spread was three-times the 90-day average.  German bunds have handed investors a loss of 0.7 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. French
bonds rose 1.1 percent, and Greek bonds dropped 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
