The  European Central Bank ’s second
tranche of three-year loans next week may mark the end of its
“generous” provision of long-term funding, according to
 Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK)   While markets are hoping for “a continuation of the
program through the rest of the year,” another large long-term
refinancing operation, or LTRO, after this one “seems
unlikely,” London-based Deutsche Bank chief economist  Thomas Mayer  said in a note to clients today.  “We expect the more hawkish ECB council members, coming
mainly from the AAA-rated countries, to oppose continuing
generous LTROs on the grounds that these operations will reduce
adjustment pressure on both governments and banks,” Mayer
wrote. “Unless the euro crisis deteriorates significantly
further,” Deutsche Bank expects the ECB “to wind down these
operations” after the next three-year operation, he said.  The Frankfurt-based ECB will offer banks a second batch of
three-year loans on Feb. 28 and award them on Feb. 29. It lends
banks as much money as they ask for against eligible collateral.
In the first three-year operation in December, the ECB provided
a record 489 billion euros ($647 billion) to banks. It has also
previously offered banks unlimited 12-month loans.  Deutsche Bank expects next week’s three-year allocation to
be “about the same size” as the first one, Mayer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
