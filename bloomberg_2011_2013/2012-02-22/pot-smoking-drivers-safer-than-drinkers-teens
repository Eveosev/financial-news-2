Marijuana is safer for drivers than
alcohol, teenagers said in a survey by Liberty Mutual Holding
Co. and a group promoting responsible behavior among students.  Thirty-six percent of teens who drove after using marijuana
said the drug wasn’t a distraction. Among those who reported
drinking before driving, 19 percent said alcohol presented no
distraction, according to a statement today from the Boston-
based insurer.  Adolescents have become more receptive to marijuana use by
drivers, according to the company, which conducted the survey
with SADD, or Students Against Destructive Decisions. The
portion of teens who said marijuana use was very distracting or
extremely distracting to their driving fell to 70 percent in the
most recent study from 78 percent two years earlier.  The data reflect “a dangerous trend toward the acceptance
of marijuana and other substances,” Stephen Wallace, a senior
adviser for policy, research, and education at SADD, said in the
statement.  About 19 percent of teen drivers said they’ve been behind
the wheel under the influence of marijuana, compared with 13
percent who report driving after drinking. The study included a
survey of more than 2,000 teenagers in 11th and 12th grades last
year at 28 high schools across the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
