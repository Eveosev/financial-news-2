Ethiopian and Somali troops captured
the central Somali town of Baidoa from al-Shabaab, the militant
group linked to al-Qaeda, Ethiopian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Dina Mufti said.  “Baidoa has fallen into the hands of Transitional Federal
Government and Ethiopian forces,” he said in a phone interview
from  Addis Ababa , the Ethiopian capital, today.  The campaign to force the rebels from Somalia’s third-
largest city began yesterday, according to Dina.  Ethiopian forces will leave Baidoa “as soon as possible,”
he said. “As soon as peace and stability is realized we will
hand it over to the legitimate owners, Somalis,” he said.  Ethiopia’s military entered Somalia in December, seizing
the central town of Beledweyne from al-Shabaab, government
spokesman Bereket Simon said last month.  Also battling the militants are 12,000 African Union troops
from Uganda, Burundi and Djibouti. The United Nations today
authorized an increase in the AU’s peacekeeping mission in the
country, known as Amisom, to 17,731 troops. Kenya deployed
troops into southern Somalia in October in pursuit of al-
Shabaab.  The Horn of Africa nation has been wracked by a civil war
since the ouster of Mohamed Siad Barre, the former dictator, in
1991. Al-Shabaab, which controls most of southern and central
Somalia, has been fighting President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed’s administration in Mogadishu in a bid to establish an
Islamic state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
