Straumann Holding AG (STMN) , the biggest
maker of dental implants, fell the most in more than three years
in Zurich trading after 2011 profit missed analyst estimates and
its forecast disappointed some investors.  Straumann dropped 8.4 percent to 145.70 Swiss francs at the
close of trading in Zurich, giving the company a market value of
2.28 billion francs ($2.5 billion). The decline was the biggest
since Nov. 27, 2008.  The company’s margin forecast for this year was less than
analysts have been estimating, Daniel Jelovcan, a Zurich-based
analyst for Bank Vontobel AG, wrote in a note to investors
today. Straumann said its gross margin and earnings before
interest and taxes margin in 2012 will be at least in line with
2011 levels of 76 percent and 17 percent of sales, respectively.  Straumann saw “very strong growth in  North America 
‘cannibalized’ by weak European patterns,” Jelovcan wrote. He
has a “hold” recommendation on Straumann’s shares.  Net income dropped 46 percent to 71 million francs ($77.9
million) last year, the Basel, Switzerland-based company said in
a statement today, missing the 75.6 million-franc  average
estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
