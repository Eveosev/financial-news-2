Swedish  unemployment  rose more than
estimated last month as  Europe ’s debt crisis weighs on demand in
the largest Nordic economy.  The non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, based on a
survey of about 29,500 people, rose to 8.0 percent from 7.1
percent the prior month, Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  said
today. The  median estimate  of 13 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for 7.9 percent.  “Slower economic growth reduces the demand for labor, and
unemployment will therefore increase somewhat during the year,”
the Riksbank said on Feb. 16.  The central bank this month cut its key rate for a second
time in as many as meetings in an effort to avert a recession.
Sweden’s economy, which relies on  exports  for about half its
production, will slow this year after shrinking a  quarterly 1.7
percent  in the three months through the end of 2011, the central
bank predicted. Growth will slow to 0.7 percent this year from
4.5 percent in 2011, according to the central bank’s forecast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
