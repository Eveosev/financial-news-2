Verizon Wireless , the nation’s
largest wireless service provider, says it has restored service
on its fourth-generation LTE network after a morning
distruption, the third such issue in as many months.  “LTE service is fully restored,” said Tom Pica, a Verizon
Wireless spokesman. The company started receiving service
complaints at about 6:30 a.m. New York time, said Pica, adding
that 3G service, as well as calls and texts were not affected.  Customers in Arizona, Wisconsin and California reported on
Verizon’s 4G long-term-evolution or LTE community online forum
that disruptions in service began early today.  Verizon Wireless, co-owned by  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 
and  Vodafone Group PLC (VOD) , had two similar LTE outages in December,
with service disruption lasting a full day on the first occasion
and several hours on the second.  The Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based company hasn’t
specified the cause of the latest LTE problems.  Verizon Wireless was the first U.S. carrier to offer LTE
service nationally. Rival  AT&T Inc. (T)  is currently rolling out the
service, which is now available in 26 cities, and plans to be
nationwide by the end of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
