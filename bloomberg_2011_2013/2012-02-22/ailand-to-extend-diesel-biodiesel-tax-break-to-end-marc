Thailand â€™s Cabinet agreed to extend
a reduction in excise taxes for diesel and biodiesel until the
end of March amid rising global  oil prices , said Pakdihan
Himathongkam, a deputy government spokesman.  The extension may reduce government revenue collection by 9
billion baht a month, he told reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
