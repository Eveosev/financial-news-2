Manchester United forward  Wayne
Rooney  will miss the team’s Europa League match tomorrow with a
sore throat, manager  Alex Ferguson  said.  “He has a bad throat,” Ferguson said today in comments on
the team’s website. “There were traces of it in Amsterdam last
Thursday and he’s been in bed for a lot of the weekend.”  United is leading Ajax after winning 2-0 in Amsterdam in
the first of their two matches in Europe’s second-tier club
competition. Rooney may be available for United’s trip to
Norwich this weekend, Ferguson said.  Dimitar Berbatov may start in Rooney’s place against Ajax.
Midfielder Tom Cleverley is expected to play against the Dutch
side after recovering from an ankle injury, the manager said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
