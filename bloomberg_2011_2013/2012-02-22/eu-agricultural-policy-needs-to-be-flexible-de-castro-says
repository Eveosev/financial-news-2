The European Union’s Common
Agricultural Policy should let member countries tailor programs
to their crops, said Paolo de Castro, chairman of the European
Parliament’s agriculture and rural development committee.  The European Commission said last month it would require
farmers to set aside 7 percent of farmland for so-called
greening and force them to diversify their crops. Those
proposals may not work for farmers growing food like olives, de
Castro said in an interview today at the National Farmers Union
conference in Birmingham,  England .  “We’ve said many times that we need more flexibility
because there are 27 member states,” Brussels-based, Italian
representative de Castro said, adding governments should be able
to choose environmental programs to suit their country, for
example.  Forcing farmers to leave a set amount of farmland out of
production isn’t possible in parts of southern  Europe  where
olive trees would have to be cut down and removed from the
ground, de Castro said. Farmers should be allowed to reduce
their farmland by 3 or 4 percent, for example, if 7 percent is
prohibitive, he said.  CAP’s so-called greening initiatives must not cause  food 
production to fall amid scarcity and a rising global population,
de Castro said.  “The first question is how the new CAP will increase
agriculture potential because we need more food and less
pollution,” he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
