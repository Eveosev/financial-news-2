Stocks fell worldwide for a second
day and U.S. Treasuries rose after reports on the European and
Chinese economies spurred concern about growth. Gold jumped, and
the yen fell to a seven-month low versus the dollar.  The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of equities retreated 0.4
percent to 329.17 at 4:08 p.m. New York time. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index decreased 0.3 percent to 1,357.66. Yields on
10-year U.S. Treasuries declined six basis points to 2 percent.
Gold futures climbed to $1,783.40, the highest price since Nov.
16. The yen weakened to 80.40 per dollar.  European services and manufacturing output shrank in
February, according to Markit Economics, while another report
showed Chinese manufacturing may shrink a fourth straight month
in February. The  S&P 500  slumped after rallies in six out of the
past seven weeks put it within 0.1 percent yesterday of
1,363.61, its highest closing level since 2008.  “We have a trifecta of worrisome news,”  Alan Gayle , a
senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond,
 Virginia , which oversees about $47 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “The softness in economic data suggests that global
momentum remains muted. We have slower earnings growth and the
market is facing some technical resistance.”  Dell Inc. (DELL)  retreated 5.8 percent. Its first-quarter sales
forecast missed analysts’ estimates, dragged down by lackluster
personal-computer demand from consumers and governments.  Homebuilders Drop  KB Home and Toll Brothers Inc. slumped at least 4.1 percent
in U.S. stock trading. The National Association of Realtors said
sales of previously owned houses reached a 4.57 million annual
pace in January, missing the median economist projection of 4.66
million in a Bloomberg News survey. The December figure was cut
to 4.38 million from 4.61 million.  Futures traders are pricing in the biggest increase in U.S.
equity hedging costs since 2010 after the S&P 500 rose within 2
points of erasing last year’s slump. April futures on the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index settled at 25.15
yesterday, or 6.96 points higher than the level of the gauge.
The gap widened to 7.02 points on Feb. 17. The last time two-
month futures were that high in relation to the index known as
the VIX was July 2010.  Energy companies helped  limit  the S&P 500’s loss today.
 Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR)  rallied 7 percent and Range Resources
Corp. gained 2.9 percent after they reported higher-than-
estimated profit. The S&P 500 Energy Index rose 0.2 percent.  Crude oil futures advanced to $106.28 a barrel, the highest
settlement price since May 4.  Treasury Auction  Treasuries rose for the first time in four days after the
U.S. sold $35 billion of five-year notes. They drew a yield of
0.900 percent, compared with a forecast of 0.901 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s primary
dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.89, compared with an average of 2.9 for the previous 10 sales.  Leon Cooperman , founder of equity hedge fund Omega Advisors
Inc., said buying U.S. Treasuries is the least attractive
investment in a world of “financial repression.” Bonds will be
the worst place for investors to put their money for the next
three years, Cooperman said in an interview today on Bloomberg
Television’s “InsideTrack” with  Erik Schatzker .  The yen fell for a fifth day, the longest streak since
April. It has weakened 3.7 percent since the Bank of  Japan  on
Feb. 14 unexpectedly expanded its asset-purchase program.
Norway’s krone rallied against all its major counterparts as
investors pared bets the central bank would cut  interest rates 
after unemployment unexpectedly declined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
