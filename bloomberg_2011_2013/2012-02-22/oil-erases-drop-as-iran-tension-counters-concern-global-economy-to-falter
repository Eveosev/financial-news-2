Oil traded near the highest level in
nine months as speculation that tension with  Iran  will disrupt
supplies countered concern a faltering economy will curb demand.  Oil for April delivery was at $106.31, up 6 cents, in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:54
p.m. Sydney time. Prices earlier dropped as much as 54 cents.
Front-month futures advanced 2.5 percent yesterday to settle at
the highest level since May 4.  U.S. floor trading was closed on Feb. 20 because of the
Presidents’ Day holiday and trades were booked with yesterday’s
transactions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
