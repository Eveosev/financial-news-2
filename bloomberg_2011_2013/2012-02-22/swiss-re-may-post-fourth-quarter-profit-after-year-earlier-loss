Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) , the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, may report a fourth-quarter profit after the
repayment of  Warren Buffett ’s capital injection produced a loss
in the year-earlier period.  Net income  was probably  $313 million , according to the
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, compared
with a net loss of $725 million a year earlier. The Zurich-based
company is due to report results tomorrow morning at 7 a.m.
local time.  Swiss Re regained its AA-  credit rating  from  Standard &
Poor’s  in October after shedding risky assets, repaying a 3
billion-franc ($3.3 billion) loan from Buffett’s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. and stabilizing earnings. Michel Lies, who took
over as chief executive officer from Stefan Lippe earlier this
month, may boost the reinsurer’s dividend to 3 francs a share in
2011, from 2.75 francs the previous year, according to Bloomberg
Dividend Forecasts that factor in earnings and options prices.  The following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and
year-earlier figures in millions of dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
