OAO Lukoil (LKOH) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, tumbled the most in more than two months as
investors bet a $155 billion investment plan will squeeze
dividends.  The shares fell 3.2 percent, their biggest drop since Dec.
9, to 1,778.9 rubles by the close in Moscow.  Lukoil retreated for a second day after Chief Executive
Officer  Vagit Alekperov  said the company plans to spend $155
billion through 2021, Interfax reported yesterday. Lukoil will
spend $25 billion upgrading refineries in Russia by 2016 as part
of that plan, Interfax said today, citing Alekperov.  “With such capex, we would have difficulty understanding
how the company’s promise to raise the dividend payout can be
carried out,” Troika Dialog analysts wrote in a research note
today. “In the reality of Russian petropolitics such a strategy
leads to nothing more than a stock de-rating, in our view.”  Lukoil spokesman Gleb Ovsyannikov could not be reached for
comment on his mobile phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
