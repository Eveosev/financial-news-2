The suspension of European Union
development funds to  Hungary  under an excessive deficit
procedure should be “proportionate” to the overrun in the
shortfall, Laszlo Andor, the EU commissioner for employment,
social affairs and inclusion, said on TV station  M1  yesterday.  “The suspension should be proportionate and fair so the
current government isn’t faced with an impossible situation,”
Andor said.  The commission, the EU’s Brussels-based regulator, will
propose halting the so-called cohesion funding to Hungary for
one year starting on Jan. 1, 2013, an EU official said yesterday
on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.  The commission is “very likely” to reach a decision on
Hungary today, Andor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
