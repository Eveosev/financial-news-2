U.S. stocks fell, a day after the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index failed to hold at an almost four-
year high, as sales of previously owned houses missed estimates
and data from  Europe  and  China  spurred economic concern.  Dell Inc. (DELL) , the world’s third-largest maker of personal
computers, tumbled 5.8 percent after its sales forecast missed
estimates.  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  and KB Home dropped more than 4.1
percent to pace a slump in  homebuilders . Banks had the biggest
loss in the S&P 500 among 24 groups, falling 1.7 percent.
Gannett Co., the owner of 82 newspapers including USA Today,
surged 4.2 percent as it will boost its  dividend .  The S&P 500 retreated 0.3 percent to 1,357.66 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 27.02 points,
or 0.2 percent, to 12,938.67 after the 30-stock gauge rose above
 13,000 (INDU)  yesterday for the first time since 2008. The Russell 2000
Index of small companies dropped 0.8 percent to 816.50.  “You can ride this, but you’ve got to be very careful and
sit near the exit,”  David Darst , the New York-based chief
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said in a
telephone interview. His firm has $1.6 trillion in client
assets. “Most of the economies are slowing. Earnings will be
slowing. The market is overbought.”  Stocks fell as purchases of previously owned homes rose to
a 4.57 million annual rate, less than forecast, data from
National Association of Realtors showed. China’s manufacturing
may shrink for a fourth month, according to data from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit. European services and manufacturing
output unexpectedly contracted.  Fitch Ratings  lowered Greece’s
credit rating and said a default is highly likely.  Monthly Gain  Today’s loss trimmed the S&P 500’s gain in February to 3.5
percent. Still, the index was poised for a third straight month
of gains, the  longest streak  in a year, on higher-than-estimated
economic data and expectations Europe would tame its crisis. The
S&P 500 yesterday failed to hold above its April 2011 peak of
 1,363.61 (SPX) , which was the highest level since June 2008.  “We have a trifecta of worrisome news,”  Alan Gayle , a
senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond,
Virginia, which oversees about $47 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “The softness in economic data suggests that global
momentum remains muted. We have slower earnings growth and the
market is facing some technical resistance.”  Earnings at S&P 500 companies will grow 7.4 percent this
year, according to the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg
survey, following a 15 percent increase in 2011.  Dell Tumbles  Dell tumbled 5.8 percent to $17.15. Sluggish sales have
raised concerns about Dell’s comeback plan, which has relied on
streamlining operations to boost earnings. After an almost 25
percent gain in Dell’s shares this year, some investors may have
been overly optimistic about the company’s ability to turn
around its operations, said  Brian Marshall , an analyst at ISI
Group Inc. in San Francisco.  A gauge of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes dropped 2.7 percent.
Toll Brothers declined 5.2 percent to $22.48. The largest U.S.
luxury-home builder reported an unexpected first-quarter loss.
 KB Home (KBH)  decreased 4.2 percent to $11.26.  Financial shares dropped on speculation Europe’s rescue
package for Greece won’t resolve the region’s debt crisis. Euro-
area finance ministers signed off yesterday on a 130 billion-
euro ($172 billion) rescue for Greece aimed at averting the
first sovereign default in the currency union’s 13-year history.  The KBW Bank Index declined 2 percent as all of its 24
stocks retreated.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  dropped 3 percent to $32.36.
 Regions Financial Corp. (RF)  erased 3 percent to $5.80.  Wal-Mart, Gannett  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  fell the  most  in the Dow, slumping 2.5
percent to $58.60. The shares retreated 3.9 percent yesterday
after the world’s largest retailer reported fourth-quarter
profit that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Gannett (GCI)  surged 4.2 percent to $15.61. The company said it
will raise its quarterly  dividend  to 20 cents a share from 8
cents. The publisher’s goal is to return more than $1 billion to
shareholders by 2015, the company said.  Intuit Inc. (INTU)  gained 5.9 percent to $60.92. The seller of
TurboTax software for filing with the Internal Revenue Service
boosted its full-year earnings forecast.  Energy shares added 0.2 percent for the biggest increase
among 10 groups in the S&P 500.  Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR)  climbed 7
percent, the most in the benchmark gauge, to $21.78. The world’s
largest land-drilling contractor reported fourth-quarter sales
and earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  A two-week retreat in the  Dow Jones Transportation Average (TRAN) 
may signal a warning for the rally that has added $1.35 trillion
to American equity values this year, according to analysts who
use charts to predict markets.  Leading Indicator  The gauge has fallen 3.8 percent since Feb. 3, a period in
which the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8 percent and
reached the  highest level  since May 2008. The transportation
average is viewed by some analysts as a leading indicator
because truckers, airlines and couriers may be the first to
experience the effects of an economic slowdown.  “This market does seem to be overdue for a pullback,”
Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment
Services LLC in Hammond, Indiana, said in a phone interview.
Horizon oversees $150 million and uses the relationship between
the industrial and transportation gauges to determine how much
cash to hold. A divergence “doesn’t always necessarily signal a
change in the major trend, but it can foreshadow a bit of a
correction,” he said.  Futures traders are pricing in the biggest increase in U.S.
equity hedging costs  since 2010  after the  S&P 500  rose within 2
points of erasing last year’s slump.  Wider Gap  April futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index  closed  at 25.15 yesterday, or 6.96 points
higher than the level of the gauge, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The gap widened to 7.02 points on Feb. 17. The
last time two-month futures were that high in relation to the
index known as the VIX was July 2010.  The S&P 500 has surged 24 percent since Oct. 3 on optimism
Europe will resolve the debt crisis. Now, traders are increasing
hedges to protect against losses, according to Dominic Salvino,
a specialist on the CBOE floor for Group One Trading.  “The consensus bet is that we’re going to have turmoil or
some levels of higher volatility in the future,” Liam Dalton,
who oversees about $1.8 billion as chief executive officer of
Axiom Capital Management Inc. in New York, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. “If you were to talk about a breakdown in
cooperation in Europe, it would affect everything. If the
sentiment goes negative, then you can get these periods of
increased volatility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
