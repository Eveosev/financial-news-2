The ruble strengthened against the
dollar and bond yields fell to a six-month low as Iranian oil
disruptions spurred demand for Urals crude,  Russia ’s chief
export earner.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 29.68 per
dollar at 7 p.m. in Moscow, its strongest closing level since
Sept. 8. The yield on Russia’s $2 billion of Eurobonds due 2015
dropped nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 2.567
percent, the lowest level since Aug. 4.  Urals crude  rose 0.3 percent to $121.48 a barrel, the
highest since April 29, after the  Middle East ’s second-biggest
oil producer denied  United Nations  inspectors access to a
suspected nuclear site, raising concern that tensions between
the Persian Gulf nation and Western countries may escalate.
Prices for the commodity will probably “spike” higher,  David
Greely , head of energy research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in
 New York , wrote in a report today.  “Taxes and the high oil price” are driving the ruble’s
gains, Sergey Ponomarev, head of foreign exchange at Moscow Bank
for Reconstruction and Development in Moscow, said by e-mail.
The lender expects crude prices to remain elevated, he said.  Russian companies pay taxes in the second half of every
month. Exporters convert revenues from abroad into rubles,
boosting demand for the Russian currency.  Catching-up ‘Overdue’  “Should the oil price spike up as a result of a breakout
of a geopolitical crisis in the Middle East, we think that the
ruble would be well positioned to rally,”  Benoit Anne , head of
emerging-markets strategy at Societe Generale SA in  London ,
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “Some simple chart
evidence suggests that while the ruble and the oil price enjoy a
strong relationship, the ruble has actually lagged the oil-price
rally lately, which may indicate that some catching-up is
overdue.”  Urals has climbed 9.7 percent so far this month, while the
ruble has appreciated 1.7 percent against the dollar.  Brazil ’s
real climbed 2.1 percent over the same period,  India ’s rupee
strengthened 0.8 percent and  China ’s yuan gained 0.2 percent.  The ruble was 0.5 percent stronger at 39.2526 per euro and
33.9877 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.
Investors pared bets the Russian currency would weaken, with
non-deliverable forwards showing it at 30.0295 per dollar in
three months’ time, compared with expectations of 30.1223 per
dollar yesterday.  Lukoil, Gazprom Bonds  The yield on Russia’s 2020 dollar-denominated notes fell
seven basis points to 4.013 percent. The yield on 2020 Eurobonds
issued by OAO Lukoil, the country’s second largest oil company,
declined 11 basis points to 5.605 percent, while the yield on
2021 dollar notes from state gas monopoly OAO Gazprom was little
changed at 5.374 percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps fell two basis points to
201 basis points, down from last year’s peak of 338 on Oct. 4,
