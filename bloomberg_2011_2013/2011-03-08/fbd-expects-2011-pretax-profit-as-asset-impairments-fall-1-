  FBD Holdings Plc (FBH)  Chief Executive
Officer Andrew Langford said he expects the Irish insurer to
return to profit on a pretax basis this year on lower asset
impairment charges.  FBD posted a narrowed pretax loss of 3.08 million euros
($4.29 million) for the year ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss
of 34.6 million euros a year earlier, the Dublin-based company
said in a statement today. The company took asset-impairment
charges of 50 million euros.  “Certainly in terms of a profit before tax figure, I am
expecting we will be in the black,” Langford said in a phone
interview. “We’ve been as prudent as we possibly can.”  The potential for more impairment charges at FBD, which has
reported losses for the past three years as it wrote down hotel
holdings in Ireland and  Spain , is “limited,” according to
Langford. The insurer said operating earnings per share may rise
to between 130 euro cents and 140 cents this year, from 106 in
2010, if there aren’t exceptional claims.  “We still very much like this story,” Ken Darmody, an
analyst with Dublin-based Goodbody Stockbrokers, wrote in a
note, citing the company’s outlook. Writedowns in 2010 were
about 20 million euros more than estimated, he said.  The company booked a 17 million-euro impairment charge on
its hotel and golf course assets in 2010. The company took a 19
million-euro loss on its secured loan holdings.  Shares Move  The shares fell 2.6 percent to 7.55 euros at the 5:10 p.m.
close of Dublin trading. The stock has gained 22 percent this
year, valuing the company at 251.2 million euros.  The net loss narrowed to 2.4 million euros from 30.2
million euros in 2009. Operating profit rose 41 percent to 40.7
million euros, as the company increased rates and net claims
fell in the underwriting business.  Severe weather conditions in January and December partially
“masked” the benefit of rate increases, according to Langford.
The company doesn’t expect to raise rates in the short term, he
said.  FBD plans to pay a final dividend of 21 cents per share,
giving a total for the year of 31.5 cents, up from 30 cents in
2009. The insurer’s “prudent” handling of reserves brings its
solvency level to 61 percent of net earned premium, from 52
percent in 2009, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
