Scottish Widows Investment
Partnership, Edinburgh’s second-biggest fund manager, is putting
$900 million into U.S. high-yield bonds, which almost doubled
investors’ money during the past two years.  Scottish Widows will move Neil Murray, head of credit, to  New York  next month as part of a plan to manage money in the
U.S. in June, Mark Connolly, director of fixed income, said in
an interview at the company’s headquarters.  U.S. non-investment grade, or junk, bonds returned 3.7
percent this year, adding to annual gains of 15 percent and 58
percent in the previous two years, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index. The
measure is up 90 percent since March 4, 2009. Investors have
added cash to junk bond funds for the 12th straight week, the
longest streak since October 2009, EPFR Global data show.  “As our clients ask us to diversify portfolios, we want to
be able to manage assets derived from the largest  capital market 
in the world,” said Connolly, who is in charge of teams
managing about 68 billion pounds ($110 billion) of assets. The
high-yield market is first because “we can see a very strong
economic and client driver for it,” he said.  Corporate bond sales in the U.S. are rebounding from the
lowest level this year as economic reports ease concern that
rising oil prices will derail the recovery. The U.S.
unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 8.9 percent in February,
the lowest level in almost two years, and employers boosted
payrolls amid growing confidence.  Bond Sales  Sales of speculative-grade bonds soared to $12.7 billion in
the five days through March 4 from $1.07 billion the week
before, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The move is designed to grow the business and “also to
protect what we have,” Connolly said on March 2. “If we don’t
do this, our clients in time will use other managers. It’s as
much a defensive as it is an offensive strategy.”  Returns are beating sovereign debt. U.S. government bonds
have lost 0.4 percent since Dec. 31, according to Merrill Lynch
Indexes. Treasuries returned 5.9 percent last year after losing
3.7 percent in 2009, Merrill’s Treasury Master Index shows. The
yield on the 10-year Treasury note, the market bellwether, was
at 3.52 percent today, after climbing to as high as 3.77 percent
on Feb. 9, the most since April 2010.    Scottish Widows  plans to start investing money for clients
in investment-grade debt in the U.S. in early 2012, Connolly
said. In all, the firm first recruited three people for high-
yield debt in the U.S. Management of European high-yield bonds
will remain in Edinburgh, he said.  The 2.65 billion-pound Scottish Widows Corporate Bond Fund,
the company’s biggest mutual fund, rose 4.9 percent in the 12
months to March 4, ranking 60th of 87 similar funds and compared
with an average increase of 5.6 percent, according to data from
Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. The fund, overseen by Murray,
placed 47th of 78 peers over the past three years, gaining 13.8
percent compared with the average of 14.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
