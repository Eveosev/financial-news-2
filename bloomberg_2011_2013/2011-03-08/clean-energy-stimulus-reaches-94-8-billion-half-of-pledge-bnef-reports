Governments led by  China  and Japan
have spent almost half of their promised clean-energy stimulus
funds to date, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  Of the $194.3 billion promised to clean and low-carbon
energy projects by major economies after the financial crisis,
$94.8 billion has so far been allocated, the London-based
industry analyst said.  “Higher-than-expected activity” in China and Japan in
2010 accelerated the pace of spending with $74.5 billion
deployed in that year alone, New Energy Finance said. Europe and
the U.S. remain “on track” with expected clean-energy stimulus
spending.  From this year onwards, $99.5 billion remains to be spent
on programs that range from small-scale  energy efficiency 
initiatives to larger renewables projects and  carbon capture  and
storage plants, New Energy Finance said.  “Only last year, swings in policy from  Spain  to the U.S.,
and China to Germany, had a significant impact on the flows of
billions of dollars of investment into low-carbon energy,” the
company said as it also started a “policy dashboard” tracking
developments in global low-carbon policy.  The tool was a response to the “increasing complexity of
the policy and regulatory environment worldwide,” New Energy
Finance Chief Executive Michael Liebreich said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
