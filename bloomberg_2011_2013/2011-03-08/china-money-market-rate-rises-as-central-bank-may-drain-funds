  China ’s benchmark money-market rate
climbed for the first time in four days on speculation the
central bank will drain funds from the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China will take out 110 billion yuan
($16.8 billion) via 28-day  repurchase agreements  today,
according to Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at
Societe Generale SA. The last “sizeable” repurchase operation
totaled 145 billion yuan of 91-day agreements in October, Chong
said.  “It means the central bank is stepping up the liquidity
mopping exercise and the recent low seven-day repurchase fixing
isn’t likely to last long, although redemptions remain high in
the coming few weeks,” Hong Kong-based Chong said.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge measuring the
availability of funds, rose four basis points to 2.22 percent,
according to a daily fixing from the National Interbank Funding
Center published at 11 a.m. in  Shanghai . That’s the biggest
increase since Feb. 22. Chong forecasts the repo rate to be
around 3 percent in the coming months.  China’s central bank today sold 1 billion yuan of one-year
bills through the open market, keeping the yield unchanged for a
third week at 2.9972 percent. The yield on the government’s 3.77
percent bond due December 2020 rose two basis points to 3.96
percent, according to Chinabond, the nation’s biggest debt-
clearing house.  The Asian nation still has room to raise the reserve
requirement ratio for lenders,  Wu Xiaoling , a former deputy
Chinese central bank governor, said at yesterday’s National
People’s Congress. The People’s Bank last ordered banks to set
aside more money as reserves on Feb. 24, raising the ratio by
half a percentage point to 19.5 percent.  The one-year swap contract tied to the seven-day repo rate
fell for a fourth day, slipping nine basis points to 3.60
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest level since Jan. 26. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
