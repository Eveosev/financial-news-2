Japan’s 10-year bonds fell, pushing
yields toward a two-week high, as a gain in stocks damped demand
for the relative safety of government debt.  Benchmark notes also dropped for the third time in four
days before a report tomorrow that economists said will show
machine orders increased in January for a second month. Thirty-
year bonds were little changed after the  Finance Ministry  sold
600 billion yen ($7.29 billion) of the securities today.  “Stocks are rebounding, which is a sell factor for
bonds,” said RuiXue Xu, a strategist in Tokyo at RBS Securities
Japan Ltd., a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. “Bonds are
likely to fluctuate as upward momentum in stocks isn’t strong.”  The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due March 2021 rose 2.5
basis points to 1.295 percent as of 3:40 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price fell 0.222 yen to 100.044 yen. The yield climbed to
1.315 percent on March 4, the highest level since Feb. 18.  Ten-year futures for March delivery dropped 0.12 to 139.59
at the afternoon close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average advanced 0.2 percent.  Machine orders gained 3 percent in January from the
previous month when they rose 1.7 percent, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists before tomorrow’s report.  Economy Improving  Japan’s economy is improving, while higher commodity prices
and Chinese inflation pose downside risks, Economic and Fiscal
Policy Minister  Kaoru Yosano  told reporters today in Tokyo. He
also said the increase in oil costs may gradually hurt the
global economy.  Crude oil for April delivery climbed to $106.95 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the highest level
since September 2008.  Today’s 30-year auction drew bids for 3.58 times the amount
on offer, compared with a ratio of 5.77 times at the previous
offering on Jan. 13. The lowest price was 100.15 yen, above the
100.10 predicted by traders in a Bloomberg survey.  The so-called tail, or the difference between the lowest
and the average price, was 0.13 yen compared with 0.06 at the
prior sale. The longer the tail, the less bids are clustered
around the average price.  “The auction went okay,” said Shinji Ebihara, a Japan
rates strategist at Credit Suisse Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo.
“ The tail was longer, but it doesn’t seem to be having a
negative impact on bonds.”  The 30-year yield fell half a basis point to 2.21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
