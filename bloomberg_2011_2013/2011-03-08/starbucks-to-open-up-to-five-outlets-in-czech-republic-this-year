  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s biggest
coffee-shop chain, will open as many as five new outlets in
Prague this year and is looking to expand to regional Czech
cities in the next few years, regional manager Erik Zlamal said.  The chain currently operates 11 outlets in the  Czech
Republic , all of them in the capital, Zlamal said today at a
press conference in Prague.  Starbucks is competing with Costa Coffee, the coffee chain
owned by  Whitbread Plc (WTB) , which became the Czech market leader
after taking over rival Coffeeheaven International Plc’s outlets
in the country 15 months ago. The acquisition brought the number
of Costa Coffee’s Czech outlets to 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
