  Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, plans to sell about 10 billion pesos
($833.5 million) of bonds in the domestic market on March 10 as
it seeks to refinance debt.  Financing conditions “look good” and Pemex, as the state-
owned company is known, is determining the final size of the
issue, Chief Financial Officer Ignacio Quesada said today in an
interview in Houston. The sale “should be in the order” of 10
billion pesos, he said.  The Mexico City-based company plans to seek about $8
billion in bonds and loans in 2011, with about 80 percent of
that targeted for refinancing, the company said Feb. 28. After
the domestic transaction, Pemex will issue two or three “big”
international bond sales for a total of about $3 billion, Pemex
Chief Executive Officer  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  said in a March
1 interview.  The yield on the Pemex 10-year peso bonds fell 1 basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.88 percent. The price of
the security rose 0.06 centavos to 105.650.  The company expects total debt to increase less than $1.5
billion this year to about $55.3 billion, according to a stock
exchange filing on Feb. 28. Available cash and cash from
operations will enable the company to stay below the $3.5
billion debt increase authorized by the board, Pemex said.  Last week, the Mexican oil producer posted its third
consecutive quarterly loss. The net loss narrowed to 26.04
billion pesos from 65.1 billion pesos a year earlier. Revenue
rose 10 percent to 343.1 billion pesos.  Pemex was the second-largest issuer of bonds in Latin
America last year, selling a total of $8.5 billion, according to
Bloomberg data. America Movil SAB was the largest issuer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
