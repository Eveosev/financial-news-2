Ghana’s currency depreciated against
the  U.S. dollar  as mining and shipping firms, two of the West
African nation’s biggest sellers of foreign currency, retained
their stocks of the greenback.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest gold miner, the
cedi, traded at 1.5255 per dollar as of 3:35 p.m. in Accra, from
1.5245 on March 4, according to data from  Access Bank Plc. (ACCESS)  Banks
and government offices were closed for a national holiday
yesterday.  “The mining companies, the shipping companies, we’re not
seeing them come on the market” to sell dollars, said Kwabena Owusu, a currency trader with the Accra office of the Nigeria-
based bank. “There is no supply.”  Owusu said the cedi may weaken to 1.5280 per dollar by
March 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
