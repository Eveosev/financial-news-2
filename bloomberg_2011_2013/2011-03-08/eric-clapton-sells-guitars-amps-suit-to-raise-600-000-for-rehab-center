A black Fender Stratocaster
custom-built for  Eric Clapton ’s Cream reunion concerts at  London ’s Royal Albert Hall in 2005 could sell for as little
as $20,000 at Bonhams in New York this week.  There are also much less-expensive lots among the 75
guitars and 55 amplifiers Clapton is selling to benefit his
 Crossroads Center Antigua  for drug and alcohol
rehabilitation.  “This sale is much more for the fans,” said Carey
Wallace of London-based firm Wallace & Hodgson, which put
together the auction. “There are affordable guitars,
affordable amps.”  Tomorrow’s sale is expected to take in $400,000 to
$600,000. Two earlier Crossroads auctions, at Christie’s,
totaled $5.1 million in 1999 and $7.4 million in 2004. On
both occasions, every lot sold, including a black Strat for
$959,500.  “Prices just skyrocketed and were inaccessible to the
fans,” said Wallace, whose firm also organized the
Christie’s sales.  At Bonhams, a 1920s mandolin-banjo that resembles an
ornate frying pan has a modest range of $300 to $500. A
1992 wood-body tricone resonator guitar designed by Mark
Lewis has a low estimate of $6,000.  Making a return appearance is a 1948 Gibson L-5P, with
a range of $20,000 to $30,000. It fetched more than
$100,000 in the 2004 auction, Wallace said. The buyer,
Shamir Deen, donated it to the Bonhams sale, according to
the catalog.  A 2008 sky-blue guitar designed for Clapton by the
Fender Custom Shop, has a presale range of $20,000 to
$30,000. It was probably used in concert appearances with
Steve Winwood and  Jeff Beck .  Other Guitar Gods  For those who worship other guitar gods, there’s a
2006 Fender Esquire Jeff Beck replica model signed by Beck
with a presale estimate of $4,500 to $6,500.  Clapton’s amplifiers appear on the market for the
first time, Wallace said, flagging a 1957 Fender Twin Amp
acquired by Clapton in the 1980s and “reputed to be his
favorite amp,” according to the catalog. He used it at the
1992 Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Celebration and other
concerts. The amp has a low estimate of $7,500.  Of course, once you have the guitar and the amp,
you’ll need the clothes. Fortunately, Bonhams is offering a
three-piece “Stage Suit” in “fine black wool” made by
Gianni Versace for Clapton. The presale estimate is $3,000
to $4,000.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
