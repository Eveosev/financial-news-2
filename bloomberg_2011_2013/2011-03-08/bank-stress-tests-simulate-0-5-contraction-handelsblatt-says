European banks will have to
withstand a 0.5 percent contraction of gross national product in
the Euro zone this year as part of the European Banking
Authority’s stress tests, Handelsblatt  reported , citing
information the authority sent to banks.  The stress tests will use two scenario’s, Handelsblatt
said. One scenario is based on European Commission projections
and for growth and inflation, the other on a worsening of the
European sovereign debt crisis, the newspaper said.  The latter simulation includes a 0.2 percent contraction in
2012 as well as a slump in the real-estate market, the newspaper
said. The test will have a negative impact on banks’ books as it
focuses on the short-term holding of securities, Handelsblatt
said.  The stress test, which will include the impact of rising
interest rates on refinancing, assume that European stocks fall
15 percent, the newspaper said. The crisis scenario also sees an
increase in interest rates for short-term interbank loans of 125
basis points, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
