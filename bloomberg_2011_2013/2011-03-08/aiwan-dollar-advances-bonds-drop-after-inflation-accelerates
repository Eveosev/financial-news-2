  Taiwan ’s government bonds fell,
driving the yield on 10-year notes toward a one-month high, on
speculation the central bank will raise borrowing costs after
inflation unexpectedly picked up in February.  The  consumer price index  rose 1.33 percent from a year
earlier after having increased 1.11 percent in January, the
government reported yesterday. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a gain of 1.10 percent. The
island’s central bank, which raised its benchmark interest rate
37.5 basis points to 1.625 percent last year, will next review
monetary policy on March 31.  “Investors are speculating the central bank will raise
rates this month,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader at
Cathay United Bank in Taipei. “The stronger-than-expected
inflation data has weighed on  government bonds .”  The yield on the 1.375 percent bond due March 2021, the
most-traded government debt, increased one basis point to 1.43
percent as of its 1:30 p.m. close, according to Gretai
Securities Market, the island’s biggest bond exchange. It
reached 1.44 percent on March 1, the highest level for a
benchmark 10-year note since Feb. 9.  Taiwan’s dollar closed at NT$29.437 versus the greenback,
little changed from NT$29.426 yesterday, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.310 on March 4, the
strongest level since Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
