The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate bonds fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 4 basis
points to 388, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 8 a.m. in  London . The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and a decline signals improvement in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1 basis point to 100.75, JPMorgan
prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and
insurers declined 0.75 to 154.75 and the subordinated index was
2 lower at 268.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
