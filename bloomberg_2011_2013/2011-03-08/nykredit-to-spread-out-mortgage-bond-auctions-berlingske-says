Nykredit A/S, Denmarkâ€™s biggest
issuer of mortgage bonds, wants to spread out the auctions
traditionally used to refinance the debt over several months,
newspaper Berlingske Tidende reported.   Nykredit wants to ensure that the interest rates on Danish
adjustable mortgages are thus reset over the course of a quarter
instead of over several days, Copenhagen-based Berlingske
reported, citing Peter Engberg Jensen, Nykredit chief executive
officer.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
