Cotton fell from an all-time high,
halting the longest rally in more than a year, on speculation
that rising production will help ease a supply shortage.  Global output will jump 11 percent to a record 27.6 million
metric tons in the year starting Aug. 1 after prices surged, the  International Cotton Advisory Committee  said on March 1.  China ,
the world’s largest producer and consumer, aims to boost its
crop by 14 percent, according to a government report last week.  “We’ve got quite a bit more cotton coming in the future,”
said  Sid Love , the president of Joe Kropf & Sid Love Consulting
Services LLC in  Overland Park , Kansas.  Cotton for May delivery dropped by the exchange limit of 7
cents, or 3.3 percent, to settle at $2.0714 a pound at 2:54 p.m.
on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Before today, the price rose
for seven straight days, jumping 21 percent in the longest
string of gains since September 2009. The commodity reached a
record $2.197 yesterday.  The fiber has more than doubled in the past year as surging
demand outstripped global supplies.  Cotton’s 14-day relative-strength index was above 70 on
March 4 and March 7, a signal to some investors that prices were
poised to fall.  “It’s a correction as the price went up too much and too
fast,” said Toshimitsu Kawanabe, an analyst at commodity broker
Central Shoji Co. “There’s little change in fundamentals;
supply is scarce this season.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
