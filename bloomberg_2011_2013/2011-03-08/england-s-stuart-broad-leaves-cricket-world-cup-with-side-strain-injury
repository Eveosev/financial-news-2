England bowler  Stuart Broad  will
miss the rest of the cricket World Cup after hurting his side in
the teamâ€™s victory over  South Africa  last weekend.  Broad, 24, will return to the U.K. from India for treatment
for a strain to his left side, the England Cricket Board said
today in an e-mailed statement. Batsman Kevin Pietersen went
back to England to undergo surgery on a hernia.  Eoin Morgan replaced Pietersen, and the ECB will announce a
replacement for Broad.  The event ends April 2 with a final in Mumbai.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
