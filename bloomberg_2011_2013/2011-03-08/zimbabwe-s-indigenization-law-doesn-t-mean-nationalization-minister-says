  Zimbabwe ’s indigenization and
empowerment law doesn’t allow for expropriation of companies or
or mean nationalization, said  Tendai Biti , the southern African
country’s finance minister.  “There’s nothing wrong with the law on indigenization,”
he said at in investment conference today in Harare, the
capital. “It doesn’t say there’ll be nationalization. It’s not
a law which allows expropriation. We will respect our laws.”  Zimbabwe is seeking to attract international investment and
capital inflows, Biti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
