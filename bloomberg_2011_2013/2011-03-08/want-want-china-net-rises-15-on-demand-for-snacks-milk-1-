  Want Want China Holdings Ltd. (151) , the
country’s largest maker of rice cakes and flavored milk,
reported a 15 percent increase in 2010 profit as rising incomes
boosted demand for its snacks.  Net income climbed to $358.4 million, or 2.71 cents a
share, from $312.6 million, or 2.37 cents a share, a year
earlier, Want Want said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. That compares with the average $370 million of
16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 31
percent to $2.24 billion, the Shanghai-based company said.  Want Want, controlled by Taiwanese billionaire Tsai Eng- meng, is benefiting from increased demand for food products as
growth in the world’s second-largest economy boosts incomes. The
company will pay a final dividend of 1.36 cents per share.  Revenue from dairy products and beverages increased 34
percent from a year earlier. Sales of snack foods rose 22
percent while that of rice crackers climbed 34 percent, the
company said in the statement.  Want Want fell 3.4 percent to close at HK$6.45 in Hong Kong
trading, the biggest decline since Feb. 24. The stock has lost
5.3 percent this year, trailing a 2.9 percent advance by the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
