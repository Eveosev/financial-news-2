  International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , aiming to increase revenue by helping municipalities
manage traffic and water systems, said it has boosted the number
of projects it’s working on with cities to more than 2,000.  IBM had 2,133 such projects at the end of last year,
including 645 in emerging markets, the Armonk, New York-based
company said in a presentation today at its annual investor
briefing, held this year in Yorktown Heights, New York.  The company is helping cities such as Shenyang, China and
Bangkok manage energy, health-care, and public safety systems.
Using technology to monitor and make anything from cities to
buildings more efficient -- a concept IBM calls Smarter Planet -
- will be a $10 billion business for IBM by 2015, the company
said.  The business is “all the things that, even in a tough
economic environment, free up money so cities can go invest,”
Chief Executive Officer  Sam Palmisano  said at the event.  The company, which turns 100 this year, has helped Rio de
Janeiro monitor weather, energy and transportation and created a
program to track the sewer system in  Sacramento ,  California .  IBM climbed $2.35, or 1.5 percent, to $162.28 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company has
climbed 11 percent this year.  The company also said it will spend about $35 billion on
research and development over the next five years, compared with
about $30 billion spent in the past five years. The company
invests in R&D to support its main growth areas, including
Smarter Planet, as well as exploratory projects, such as mapping
a cocoa gene.  Patents and Royalties  “We invested $24 billion in R&D and yes, garnered another
18,000 patents,” Palmisano said of the company’s last long-term
roadmap, which ended last year. The company gets about $1
billion annually from licensing fees.  Palmisano reiterated IBM’s goal of nearly doubling
operating earnings per share to at least $20 in 2015. Along with
Smarter Planet, the company is investing in analytics software
and services, which help companies predict trends, and cloud-
computing, which lets customers store and access data on servers
other than their own. The two businesses will have $16 billion
and $7 billion in revenue in 2015, respectively, the company
said.  Along with geographic growth markets, which will increase
to be about 30 percent of total sales in the next five years,
the three areas will add about $20 billion to IBM’s revenue,
which totaled $99.9 billion last year, in the same time period.
It will make about $20 billion in acquisitions in that time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
