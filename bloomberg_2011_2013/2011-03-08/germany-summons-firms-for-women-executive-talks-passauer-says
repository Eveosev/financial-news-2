Ministers from German Chancellor  Angela Merkel â€™s Cabinet plan to hold a summit with human
resources chiefs from the 30 DAX companies to try to diffuse a
dispute over female representation on boards, the  Neue Passauer 
newspaper said.  Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen and Families Minister
Kristina Schroeder will host the meeting in Berlin on March 30,
the newspaper reported today, citing no one. Opposition parties
and labor unions want a minimum of 40 percent of executive-board
seats to be reserved for women, a demand opposed by the
government, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
