Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA
rose after its biggest investor,  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , offered to buy
out the minority shareholders in its own clean power unit.  Gamesa shares rose 2.2 percent to 6.50 euros in Madrid
trading today, their highest price since August. Iberdrola
offered 2.5 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in stock for the 20
percent of  Iberdrola Renovables SA (IBR)  it doesn’t own.  Spanish renewable energy stocks have suffered over the past
year after the government cut subsidies for wind and solar power
plants. The Iberdrola deal is a vote of confidence for the
industry, said Miguel Llorente, who helps manage about 3.8
billion euros for Capital at Work in Madrid.  “This puts a premium on renewables,” Llorente said in a
telephone interview. “You can’t invest in Iberdrola Renovables,
but Gamesa is pretty closely related.”  Iberdrola owns about 20 percent of Gamesa according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
