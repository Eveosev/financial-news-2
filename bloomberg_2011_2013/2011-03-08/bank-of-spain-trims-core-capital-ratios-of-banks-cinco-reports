The Bank of  Spain  has trimmed by a
few tenths of a percentage point the core capital ratios
reported by some of the nationâ€™s savings banks,  Cinco Dias  said,
citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  The change may affect some lenders that have reported core
capital ratios of 8 percent, the minimum required by the Bank of
Spain, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
