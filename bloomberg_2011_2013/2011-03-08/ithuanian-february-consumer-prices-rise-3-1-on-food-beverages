Lithuaniaâ€™s inflation rate rose to
3.1 percent in February, driven by higher food and beverage
prices.  The increase compares with a rate of 2.9 percent in the
previous month, the Vilnius-based  statistics office  said in an
e-mailed statement today. Prices advanced 0.1 percent on the
month.  Global food-price increases are spurring Lithuanian
inflation, which may average 2.8 percent this year, the central
bank forecast on Feb. 10.  Food prices, the biggest category in the consumer basket
with a 27 percent weighting, rose 1.4 percent on the month and
7.8 percent in the year, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
