New York Mets outfielder Carlos
Beltran has tendinitis in his left knee that will keep him out
for at least the next four days.  Beltran, 33, had surgery on his right knee last season,
when he was limited to 64 games, and told reporters at spring
training that the tendinitis stems from compensating for his
repaired right knee. Beltran also missed 81 games during the
2009 Major League Baseball season because of a bone bruise in
his right knee.  The Mets said Beltran, who played in his first spring
training game two days ago as a designated hitter, will be
treated with anti-inflammatory medications.  “We’re going to try to nail this problem before it becomes
more serious,” Mets General Manager  Sandy Alderson  said,
according to  MLB.com .  Beltran is in the final season of a seven-year, $119
million contract and the former Gold Glove center fielder has
asked to move to right field due to his surgically repaired
knee. The Mets are scheduled to open the season April 1
against the  Florida Marlins .  To contact the reporter on this story:
