  Old Mutual Plc (OML) , the U.K.’s third-
largest insurer by market value, posted a narrower net loss for
2010 and said it plans an initial public offering for its U.S.
asset management division by the end of next year.  The loss shrank to 282 million pounds ($457 million) from
340 million pounds a year earlier, the London-based insurer said
in a statement today. Adjusted operating profit jumped to 16
pence a share from 13.3 pence a year earlier, beating the median
estimate of 15.4 pence of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The insurer is selling units and cutting costs to reduce
debt that stood at 2.3 billion pounds at the end of 2009. The
company agreed in August to sell its U.S. life-insurance unit to
Harbinger Capital Partners for $350 million. Two months later,
talks to sell its $3.7 billion stake in  South Africa ’s  Nedbank
Group Ltd. (NED)  to HSBC Holdings Plc collapsed. The group cut debt by
100 million pounds last year and by a further 300 million pounds
in January 2011, Chief Financial Officer Philip Broadley said.  “We expect 2011 to be a year of further delivery,” Chief
Executive Officer Julian Roberts told analysts on a conference
call today, adding that the group is on track to meet its three-
year plan targets, including a 1.5 billion-pound cut in debt.  The shares gained as much as 3.4 percent to 137.8 pence in
London trading, the highest since Oct. 19. The stock was up 3.9
pence at 137.4 pence as of 12:42 p.m.  The insurer, which raised its dividend for the year to 4
pence from 1.5 pence a year ago, will continue to increase its
payouts “progressively,” Roberts said today.  Sales climbed 7 percent to 1.49 billion pounds in 2010,
boosted by a 28 percent increase in the U.K. Funds under
management rose 6 percent to 309.3 billion pounds.  The insurer is focusing on strengthening Nedbank after HSBC
abandoned talks to acquire the South African bank last year,
particularly in the areas of retail banking and the growth of
non-interest revenue, Roberts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
