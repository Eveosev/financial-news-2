The Sofia Court of Appeal started
bankruptcy proceedings for  Moststroy AD (5MY) , a bridge construction
company controlled by Bulgarian billionaire Vassil Bozhkov.  The court decided to declare the company insolvent since
Sept. 30 and scheduled a meeting of creditors for April 4, the
company said in a filing to the Bulgarian Stock Exchange today.
The court has also appointed a receiver, the company said.  The court’s decision overturns a Dec. 21 ruling of the
Sofia City Court rejecting Moststroy’s insolvency claim on the
grounds the company had sufficient assets for debt repayment.  Moststroy filed for insolvency on Oct. 7 after saying all
its bank accounts were frozen because of unpaid debts. After
declaring insolvency a company can restructure and work on a
rehabilitation plan, according to Bulgarian law.  Moststroy shares fell 30 percent today to 0.26 lev on the
Bulgarian Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
