U.S. Gulf crude premiums slumped as
the benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate’s discount to its European
counterpart narrowed for the fifth consecutive day to the
smallest spread since January.  The gap between April-delivery WTI futures and Brent, the
basis for European and West African crudes, narrowed $1.41 to
$8.19 at 2:10 p.m. in  New York . The differential reached a
record $15.94 on Feb. 16 and last settled this low on Jan. 20 at
$6.99.  When Brent falls versus WTI, it weakens the value of low-
sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against Brent.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed $3.25 to $10.75 a
barrel at 2:02 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened $3.10 to $10.50.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI narrowed $4.75 to $3.75 a barrel, while Poseidon
weakened $4.40 to $3.60 over the benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium shed $2.25 to $3.75 a
barrel. Thunder Horse weakened $4.90 to $8 a barrel over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount was slipped 5 cents to $3.65 a
barrel. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium slumped $3.25 to $8.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select
widened 20 cents to $20.10 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
