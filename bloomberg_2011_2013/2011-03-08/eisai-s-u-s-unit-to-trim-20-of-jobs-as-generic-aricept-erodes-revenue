Eisai Co., the Japanese drugmaker
that lost patent protection on its bestselling pill in November,
said it will fire 20 percent of its U.S. workforce by April 1.  The elimination of about 600 U.S. jobs are part of a
broader 900-person reduction included in a five-year strategic
overhaul, Lynn Kenney, a spokeswoman for Tokyo-based Eisai, said
in an e-mail. The company announced last week plans to cut 200
positions in  Europe  and 100 sales jobs in Japan to help improve
profitability in the face of cheaper copies of its Aricept pill.  “This restructuring is essential to our remaining
competitive in this rapidly changing environment,” Lonnel Coats,
chief executive officer of subsidiary Eisai Inc., said in a
statement. “It will enable us to continually make the necessary
investments in our science, our people and ultimately our human
health care mission,” he said.  Generic versions of Aricept have led to a 70 percent
discount in the value of the medicine, said Surajit Pal, a
health-care analyst at Elara Securities   India ) Pvt., in a March
3 report. The drug generated 322.8 billion yen ($3.9 billion) in
revenue, or about 40 percent of Eisai’s sales, in the year ended
March 31, 2010.  Eisai is aiming for an operating margin, or the amount of
profit on each yen of revenue, of 25 percent by fiscal 2016,
according to presentation material filed with the exchange on
March 3. The company’s 2010 operating margin was 11 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Eisai gained 1.3 percent to 3,150 yen at the 3 p.m. close
of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark Topix
index slid 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
