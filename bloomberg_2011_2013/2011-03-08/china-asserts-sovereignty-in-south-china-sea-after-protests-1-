China reasserted its sovereignty
over the  South China Sea  following protests from the Philippines
and Vietnam last week following separate incidents in the
disputed waters.  "China holds indisputable sovereignty over the South China
Sea," Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Jiang Yu told reporters in
Beijing today. "China seeks to solve disputes with friendly
consultation with other countries."  The protests add to growing calls from Southeast Asian
leaders for a code of conduct for ships traveling in the
disputed waters, which contain vital shipping lanes and may be
rich in oil and gas reserves. China claims most of the South
China Sea as its own and has resisted signing a set of rules.  Philippines President  Benigno Aquino  on March 4 said his
government formally protested to China after two boats harassed
an oil exploration team in the contested area.  Vietnam  objected
to Chinese counter-piracy drills near the disputed Spratly
islands, it said in a Foreign Ministry  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
