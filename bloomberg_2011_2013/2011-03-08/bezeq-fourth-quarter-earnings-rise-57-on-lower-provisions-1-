Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication
Corp.’s fourth-quarter profit increased 57 percent after the
country’s biggest phone company said early retirement provisions
declined compared with the previous year.  Net income rose to 575 million shekels ($160 million) from
366 million shekels a year earlier, the Tel Aviv-based company
said today in a statement. That compared with the 578.5 million-
shekel median estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Provisions for employees’ early retirement plans in the
fourth-quarter of 2010 were 5 million shekels against 267
million shekels in the same period the previous year.  “Bezeq is one of the most stable companies to invest in,
despite the regulation and the recent events in the Middle
East,” Eran Jacoby, head of research at the Tel Aviv-based DS
Securities & investments Ltd., said in a telephone interview.
Jacoby was referring to the company’s forecasts of posting 2011
net income similar to 2010 levels. “This means Bezeq will
distribute over 3 billion of shekels dividends next year,” he
said.  The stock fell 0.4 percent to 9.9 shekels at the 4:30 p.m.
