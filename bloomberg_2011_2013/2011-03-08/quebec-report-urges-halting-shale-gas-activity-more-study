  Quebec ’s environmental assessment
bureau recommended halting natural-gas exploration and
production in Canadian shale fields until more study provides a
better understanding of the environmental impacts of the process
known as hydraulic fracturing.  The recommendation, made in a government report released
today, was the result of an investigation into the industry’s
practice of injecting water, sand and chemicals to shatter
underground rocks and release gas, also known as “fracking.”  The investigation was requested by the Quebec ministry of
natural resources and environment following months of criticism
from environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Nature Quebec
about the potential contamination of drinking-water supplies.  The report underscored the need for strict monitoring and
regulation of the industry, the government of Quebec said on its
 website . The recommendation will help guide the government’s
actions, said Pierre Arcand, Quebec’s environment minister.  Investment to explore Quebec’s shale gas formations has
reached C$100 million ($103 million) in the past two years,
according to the provincial oil and gas association. Fossil
fuels, including natural gas, make up 38 percent of Quebec’s
total energy use.  Across the U.S. border, the  Delaware  River Basin
Commission, which manages the watershed that supplies drinking
water to 15 million people in  New York ,  Pennsylvania ,  New Jersey 
and Delaware, also has put gas development on hold in the river
watershed while it drafts rules about hydraulic fracturing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
