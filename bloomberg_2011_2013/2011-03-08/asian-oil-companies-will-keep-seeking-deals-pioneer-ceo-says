Oil and gas companies in  Asia  will
continue to buy stakes in U.S. shale formations, Pioneer Natural
Resources Inc. Chief Executive Scott Sheffield said.  Most Asian companies will form joint ventures with U.S.
companies, he said. Companies won’t want the negative political
backlash that  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , based in  China , went through when it
tried to buy Unocal Corp. in 2005, he said.  “The next wave, I think, is the Asian JVs,” Sheffield
said in an interview with Bloomberg News at CERAWeek, a Houston
conference held by IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates.  Sheffield said the next round of joint ventures may come
from Japanese and South Korean companies.  “You’ll see a lot more capital come in,” he said.  Dallas-based Pioneer decided in 2006 to sell its operations
in the Gulf of Mexico, Canada and Argentina and focus on U.S.
fields.  Pioneer, based in Irving, Texas, formed a $1.3 billion
joint venture with India-based Reliance Industries Ltd. in 2010
to extract oil and gas in the Eagle Ford shale formation in
South  Texas . Chesapeake Energy sold a $1 billion stake in its
Marcellus shale operations to Cnooc in November.  Pioneer sold its last overseas holding, in  Tunisia , to OMV
AG in January for $866 million. The sale closed shortly before
the protests that led to the ouster of President Zine El Abidine
Ben Ali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
