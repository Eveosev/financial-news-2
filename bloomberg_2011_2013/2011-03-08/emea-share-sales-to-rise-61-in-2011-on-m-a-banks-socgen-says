Companies in Europe, the Middle East
and  Africa  may raise 61 percent more through share sales this
year as mergers and acquisitions accelerate and banks seek to
meet capital requirements by selling equity, according to  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA.  Companies in the region will likely sell as much as 190
billion euros ($264 billion) of shares this year through initial
public offerings, additional sales and rights offers, compared
with $164 billion in 2010, according to SocGen. IPOs may raise
as much as 80 billion euros in EMEA this year, 171 percent more
than last year, the Paris-based bank said yesterday.  “It will be a very active year,” said Laurent Morel,
SocGen’s global head of equity capital markets in Paris.
“Mergers and acquisitions should finally kick back and banks in
Europe are still under pressure to raise more capital.”  Paris-based  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  on March 7
said it agreed to pay 3.7 billion euros for the Rome-based watch
and jewelry maker  Bulgari SpA (BUL)  in its biggest takeover in at
least a decade. Denmark’s largest lender, Danske Bank A/S, plans
to raise about $3.7 billion in a rights offer to boost capital
and pay back government aid, it said last month.  Banks in EMEA may raise as much as 45 billion euros this
year in rights offers, while other companies may seek as much as
50 billion euros in rights offers mostly to pay for
acquisitions, according to Morel. The entire volume of EMEA
rights offers in 2010 was $55 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Equity sales in EMEA declined 31 percent last year from
2009 and trailed the U.S. for the first time since at least 2004
as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis spread beyond  Greece .  SocGen was the ninth biggest equity underwriter in EMEA in
2010 compared with number 13 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
