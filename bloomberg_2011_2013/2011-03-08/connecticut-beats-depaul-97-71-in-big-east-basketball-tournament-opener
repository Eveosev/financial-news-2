held to 20 points in the second half after leading by 16 points
at halftime.  “I knew that everybody was going to play me for the pass

Crater, who had six points and seven assists in the game, said
in a television interview.  South Florida will face No. 7 Cincinnati tonight in a
second-round game.    Connecticut , Marquette and Rutgers also won their opening
