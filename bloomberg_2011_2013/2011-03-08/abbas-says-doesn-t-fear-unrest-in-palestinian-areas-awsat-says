Palestinian Authority President
Mahmoud Abbas said he isn’t concerned that the unrest sweeping
through the Arab world will spread to the Palestinian
territories, Asharq al-Awsat newspaper reported today.  Abbas said local elections will take place in July as
planned while legislative and presidential elections set for
September can’t be held on time because of divisions with the
Gaza Strip, the newspaper said, citing a statement he made in  London .  The Palestinian leader is in the British capital on a two-
day visit to meet with U.K. officials, including Prime Minister  David Cameron .  To contact the reporter on this story:
