Ekstraklasa SA, the company managing
the top Polish soccer league, cancelled a tender for three-year
rights to broadcast its games, it said in an e-mailed statement
today.    TVN SA (TVN) , Poland’s only publicly traded television network,
was one of the companies that bid for the rights that three
years ago cost Canal Plus 360 million zloty ($125 million).  Ekstraklasa will “in coming days” talk to TV networks in
order to sound out the possibility of selling the rights outside
the tender procedure, the company said, without elaborating.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
