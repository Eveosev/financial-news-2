Ethanol futures fell the most in two
weeks in  Chicago  as corn declined for a fourth day on
speculation that higher prices will curb consumption.  The alternative fuel followed corn lower on concern that an
11 percent rally this year will slow demand for the grain.
Prices touched a 31-month high of $7.4425 on Feb. 22. Ethanol in
the U.S. is brewed from corn.  “It was a big crash in the corn and ethanol just
followed,” said Don Salfi, a trader at BiofuelsConnect, a
Heathrow, Florida-based alternative energy broker.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 3.4 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.561 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures hit $2.618 a gallon on March 4, the highest price since
July 14, 2008, and have risen 7.7 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago decreased 2
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.585 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive slipped 1.5 cent, or 0.6 percent, to $2.67, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf declined 1 cent, or 0.4 percent,
to $2.655 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel was
unchanged at $2.69.  Corn futures for May delivery slid 12 cents, or 1.7
percent, to close at $7.055 a bushel in Chicago, the third
consecutive decline and the longest such streak since Nov. 12.
One bushel of the grain makes about 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  An average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is breaking even on every
gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing about 3
cents after losing 1 cent last week, according to Ag Trader
