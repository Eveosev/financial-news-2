Australian retail sales are likely
to increase at a slower pace than past recoveries as higher  interest rates  erode consumer spending power, Access Economics
said in a report today.  Retail sales will advance 1.6 percent in the 12 months
ending June 30, the Canberra-based research company said. Sales
will gain 2.9 percent in 2011-12 and 3 percent in 2012-13, based
on job growth, higher wages and a gradual easing of consumer
caution, Access said.  “This still looks set to be a more modest recovery in
retail spending than is typically the case when employment is
running hot,” the company, founded by two former Treasury
economists, said in the report. Retail sales grew an average of
3.1 percent in the past five years, it said.  Australian retail sales declined last quarter and Myer
Holdings Ltd., the nation’s largest department store chain, last
month cut its profit forecast for the 2011 financial year.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens left the
overnight cash rate target at 4.75 percent last week, after
seven increases from October 2009 to November 2010.  Australian employers probably added 20,000 workers last
month and the jobless rate stayed at 5 percent, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 19 economists
ahead of a March 10 employment report.  Australia recorded its biggest annual gain in employment on
record in 2010 as resource and energy companies boosted hiring
to meet demand from  China  in what the RBA has called a once-in-
a-century mining boom. Retail sales, adjusted to remove
inflation, fell 0.3 percent in the three months through Dec. 31
from the previous quarter, a report showed last month.  “One can’t ignore the recent surge in  Australia ’s
income,” Access said. “We suspect that over time, very low
rates of unemployment should help to loosen the purse strings of
consumers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael Heath  in Sydney at
