  Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR)  declined the most
in almost four months in London trading after the inter-dealer
broker said 2010 profit fell.  The shares slid as much as 6.6 percent, the most since
Nov. 11. They were down 6 percent at 400.3 pence as of 1:09 p.m.
local time, valuing the London-based firm at 857.2 million
pounds ($1.4 billion).  The company posted a 2.1 percent decline in net income to
108.5 million pounds, it said in a statement today. Revenue
dropped 4.1 percent to 908.5 million pounds because of broker
“defections” in  North America , Tullett Prebon said.  “The world’s financial markets remain unsettled, and
although it is difficult to predict market conditions, it seems
reasonable to expect that there will be periods of volatility,”
Chief Executive Officer  Terry Smith  said in the statement.  Tullett acts as a go-between for banks that trade bonds,
stocks, currencies, energy and derivatives. Inter-dealer brokers
typically handle more trades between banks during periods of
greater market volatility. Tullett, which split off from U.K.
stockbroker Collins Stewart Plc in 2006, competes against  ICAP
Plc (IAP) , the biggest broker of transactions between banks.  Tullett sued three executives affiliated with BGC Partners
Inc. in August 2009 in  New York , alleging they helped plot the
hiring of 77 of its employees. Tullet and units have sued rivals
at least four times seeking damages for poaching employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
