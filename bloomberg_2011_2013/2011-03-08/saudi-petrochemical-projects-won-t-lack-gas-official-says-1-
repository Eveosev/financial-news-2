  Saudi Arabia  has enough natural gas
to supply planned petrochemical projects, an official in charge
of allocating the fuel said.  All “committed” projects will receive gas allocations,
Prince Faisal bin Turki, who’s an adviser to the petroleum
minister, said today in an interview while attending a
conference in Yanbu, on the kingdom’s  Red Sea  coast. He declined
to comment on facilities that authorities have yet to approve.  “All projects under development and all the existing
plants producing today are fully supplied,” he said. Only
companies with a “committed” expansion will get new gas
allocation, he said, adding that the type of feedstock, whether
it’s liquid or natural gas, will depend on the project.    Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker, is switching feedstock to propane and
naphtha to make up for a reduced supply of gas, Mutlaq Al-
Morished, the company’s executive vice president for corporate
finance, said on March 3.    Saudi Aramco  will be using both heavy feedstock and gas in
all upcoming chemical projects with Total SA, Dow Chemical Co.,
and Sumitomo Chemical Co., the Dhahran-based company’s vice
president for chemicals Abdulaziz al-Judaimi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
