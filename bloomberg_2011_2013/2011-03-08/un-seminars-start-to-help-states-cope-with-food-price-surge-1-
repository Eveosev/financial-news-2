The  United Nations ’ Food &
Agriculture Organization is holding seminars across four
continents to help governments cope with record food prices.  The meetings will include government officials and farm
groups from 20 countries and cover policy responses, the Rome-
based agency said in a notice on its  website  today.  World food prices rose to a record in February, according
to an index from the FAO, which is predicting higher prices in
the coming decade. Rising prices contributed to riots across
North  Africa  and the Middle East in the past several months that
toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia.  “It is essential that countries consider their policy
options and steer away from decisions that might exacerbate the
situation,” FAO Deputy Director General Changchui He said in
the statement. “During the last food crisis, the situation was
aggravated when some countries imposed export restrictions or
engaged in panic buying.”  The two-day seminars will be held from March through June
in  Europe ,  Asia , Africa and Latin America, with the first in
Bangkok starting tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
