Spotify , the European online music
streaming service, said it has 1 million paying subscribers,
representing 15 percent of the total user base.  The Swedish company, which has been in talks with major
record labels for months about expanding to the U.S., offers
unlimited music free of charge with advertisements, or a
commercial-free service starting at 4.99 pounds ($8) a month.  Spotify, based in  Stockholm , faces a competitive U.S.
market as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  prepare to offer cloud-
based music services. The company may be worth $1 billion and
has signed deals with Sony Music Entertainment and  EMI Music  for
a U.S. start, newspapers including the New York Times have said.
Spotify is also talking to Warner Music Group and  Universal
Music Group .  “More than ever, we’re seeing the power of our freemium
model, with the vast majority of subscribers upgrading after
having first used the free service,” Spotify founder Daniel Ek
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Global revenue from music via the Internet and mobile
phones rose 6 percent to $4.6 billion last year, according to
the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. That
accounted for 29 percent of record companies’ sales. The rate of
growth was less than 2009’s 12 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
