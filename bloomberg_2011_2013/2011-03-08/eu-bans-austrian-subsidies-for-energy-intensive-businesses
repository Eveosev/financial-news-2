The European Commission banned an
Austrian program to exempt energy-intensive businesses from
funding renewable energy.  The commission  said  in an e-mailed statement today
that part of  Austria â€™s green electricity act was in breach of
European Union state-aid rules and would have forced smaller
electricity consumers to pay higher energy bills to compensate
for subsidies given to larger energy consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
