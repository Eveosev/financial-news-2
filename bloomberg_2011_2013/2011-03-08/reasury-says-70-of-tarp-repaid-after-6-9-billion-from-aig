The  U.S. Treasury  said it has
recovered 70 percent of $411 billion spent under the Troubled
Asset Relief Program now that the government has received a $6.9
billion repayment from  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , the
bailed-out insurer.  “We’re optimistic that as we continue to wind down TARP,
our temporary investments in private companies will ultimately
result in little or no cost to taxpayers when taken as a
whole,” Tim Massad, the Treasury’s acting assistant secretary
for financial stability, said today in a statement.  Congress initially authorized up to $700 billion for TARP.
The Treasury anticipates that any losses from the money that was
spent will be due to the cost of housing programs.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Rebecca Christie  in Washington at
