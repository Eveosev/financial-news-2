  Iraq , which is facing protests
demanding better living conditions and electricity supply, will
issue a tender for a $388.5 million power plant.  The  Council of Ministers  approved today the plan to issue a
tender for the plant in the Nineveh province, north of  Baghdad ,
Ali Al-Dabbagh, a spokesman for the government, said in an
emailed statement.  The plant is due to be built within 21 months and will
generate 750 megawatts, he said.  Iraq plans to almost triple power generation capacity to
17,000 megawatts by 2013, mostly through building new plants,
Masaab Serri, an Electricity Ministry spokesman, said Jan. 4.  Iraq, holder of the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves, is
struggling to raise power supplies, which are currently at about
6,000 megawatts, or half of its domestic demand of about 12,000
megawatts, Serri said. Demand is due to increase by at least
eight percent in 2012, he said.  Former Electricity Minister Karim Wahid quit in June amid
violent street protests triggered by severe seasonal summer
power shortages.  Iraq wants foreign investors to help it boost energy and
electricity production. Output of both has suffered from
insurgent attacks and a lack of investment since  Saddam Hussein ’s ouster in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
