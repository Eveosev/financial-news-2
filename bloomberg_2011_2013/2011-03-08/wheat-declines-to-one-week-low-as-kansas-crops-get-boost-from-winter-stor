Wheat futures fell to a one-week low
on speculation that a winter storm in the U.S. Great Plains will
improve topsoil moisture and boost yields for crops suffering
from months of dryness.  Parts of  Kansas , the biggest winter-wheat grower, may get
as much as 9 inches (23 centimeters) of snow today, the  National
Weather Service   said . Areas of the state were in “severe”
drought as of March 1, University of Nebraska-Lincoln data show.  “They’re calling for moisture in the western Plains,”
said Louise Gartner, the owner of Spectrum Commodities in
Beavercreek, Ohio. “It didn’t look like they got much
yesterday, but they’re looking for heavy snow in a lot of that
region today.”  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 21 cents, or 2.6
percent, to settle at $7.7975 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $7.7825, the
lowest since Feb. 24.  The most-active contract has gained 58 percent in the past
year as drought slashed output in  Russia  and floods hurt crops
in Canada and  Australia .  A quarter of the Kansas crop was in good or excellent
condition last week, unchanged from a week earlier, while
conditions in  Oklahoma  improved, the government said yesterday.  Winter wheat is planted in the U.S. Midwest and central and
southern Plains from September to early November, goes dormant
until about March, and is harvested from June to August.  Wheat  was the fourth-biggest U.S. crop in 2010, valued at
$13 billion, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
