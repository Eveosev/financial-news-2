  Monsanto Co. (MON) , an agriculture
biotechnology company, agreed to make an equity investment in
biofuel technology developer Sapphire Energy Inc. as part of a
broader agreement related to research.  The companies will collaborate to identify genes that
stimulate growth in algae and may also have agricultural
applications, St. Louis-based Monsanto said today in a
statement. Terms of the investment weren’t disclosed.  Sapphire, of  San Diego , has developed technologies to
extract from algae a renewable oil that can be refined into
replacements for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.  “Sapphire’s expertise in algal research offers a novel
platform that will allow us to screen and identify promising
genes faster,” Robb Fraley, Monsanto’s chief technology
officer, said in the statement. Working “with Sapphire, we can
identify genes affecting such traits in algae that might also be
applied to corn, cotton, soybeans and other crops.”  Monsanto was up 16 cents at 1:32 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading to $71.81.  To contact the reporter on this story:
