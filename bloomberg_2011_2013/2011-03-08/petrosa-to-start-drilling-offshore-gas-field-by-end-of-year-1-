PetroSA Ltd.,  South Africa ’s state-
owned oil and natural gas company, plans to start drilling in a  gas field  off its southern coast by the end of the year to
sustain offshore production.  The tender for the drilling contract closes at the end of
the month, acting Chief Executive Officer Everton September told
reporters in Cape Town today.  “We are in our approval process at the moment. This will
be complete before June,” he said. A final cost estimate for
the project depends on the tender, he said, adding that the
current estimate stands at about $1 billion.  The development of the F-O Field is a “key strategic
initiative,” September said. It may hold 1 trillion cubic feet
of gas and would supply the  gas-to-liquid refinery  at  Mossel
Bay , about 390 kilometers (244 miles) east of Cape Town. The
refinery produces about 5 percent of South Africa’s fuel needs
and is the company’s main source of revenue.  The F-O field is about 40 kilometers from PetroSA’s other
offshore gas deposits, which are producing gas at reduced rates
to prolong commercial operations.  “Initially we thought we’d run out of gas in 2011,” the
executive said. “The F-O field will ensure sustained operations
for an additional five to eight years,” giving the company time
to explore other feedstock options, September said.  The deposit will start output in April 2013 and is expected
to remain productive until at least 2020, according to the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
