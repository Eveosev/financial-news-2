U.K. stocks fell for the third time
in four days as  Brent crude  advanced amid concern about
political instability in the Middle East.    Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  sank 3.2 percent after the explorer focusing
on Africa and Latin America missed analysts’ earnings estimates.  Prudential Plc (PRU)  climbed 4.9 percent as the U.K.’s biggest insurer
by market raised its dividend 20 percent and reported 2010
profit that beat estimates.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  retreated 37.46, or 0.6
percent, to 5,937.3 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London . The  FTSE
All-Share Index (ASX)  also dropped 0.6 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index lost 1 percent.  The FTSE 100 has rallied 69 percent since the equity market
rally began two years ago, returning 84 percent when including
reinvested income from dividends, as the global economy
recovered from recession and corporate earnings rebounded.  Still, the gauge has fallen 2.5 percent from this year’s
highest level on Feb. 8 as investors speculated that popular
revolts will spread to the largest oil and gas producers in the
Middle East and North  Africa , increasing energy costs and
harming the global economic recovery. Brent crude climbed today
on concern that turmoil in  Libya  may spread, disrupting supplies
to  Europe .  “Traders continue to trade sensitively to any increase in
the price of crude oil whilst the Portuguese bond auction is
another opportunity for the market to gauge investor confidence
in the indebted country,” said Joshua Raymond, a market
strategist at City Index Ltd. in London.    Portugal  Bonds  Portugal’s borrowing costs increased at an auction of 1
billion euros ($1.4 billion) of bonds today. The securities due
September 2013 were issued at an average yield of 5.993 percent
compared with an average yield of 4.086 percent at a previous
auction of the same-maturity debt on Sept. 8. The sale attracted
bids for 1.6 times the amount offered, compared with a bid-to-
cover ratio of 1.9 in September.  Tullow Oil slid 3.2 percent to 1,413 pence as pretax profit
for 2010 missed estimates.  Prudential advanced 4.9 percent to 749 pence. Annual
operating profit climbed to 1.94 billion pounds ($3.1 billion),
beating the 1.74 billion-pound median estimate of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, the London-based insurer said. Prudential
raised its full-year dividend to 23.9 pence a share.    Restaurant Group Plc (RTN) , the U.K. owner of the Frankie and
Benny’s chain, surged 9.4 percent to 306.1 pence, the most in
almost two years. Chief Executive Officer Andrew Page said the
company is confident of meeting analysts’ full-year estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
