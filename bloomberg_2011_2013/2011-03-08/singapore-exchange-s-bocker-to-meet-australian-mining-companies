  Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX)  Chief
Executive Officer  Magnus Bocker  will meet Australian government
and mining industry leaders in Perth tomorrow, Magdalyn Liew,
spokeswoman for the Singapore bourse, said.  “The purpose of the trip is to identify opportunities in
the Australian mining industry that require funding,” Liew said.
SGX head of listings Lawrence Wong, a group of Singapore-based
investment bankers, and resource-related companies are
accompanying Bocker, she said.  Bocker’s second visit to Australia in two weeks comes as he
tackles political opposition to the Singapore bourse’s A$7.6
billion ($7.7 billion) bid for  ASX Ltd. (ASX) , operator of the stock
exchange in Sydney. Merging the two bourses is the best option
if Australia wants to stay relevant in global share trading,
Bocker said in Sydney last week.  The deal, which was approved by the Australian Competition
and Consumer Commission in December, still requires the support
of Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan, the Foreign Investment
Review Board, the  Reserve Bank  of Australia, the Australian
Securities & Investments Commission and parliamentarians,
several of whom have opposed the sale on national interest
grounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
