German chemical companies may face
worker demonstrations over pay in a dispute about the extent of
economic recovery, Handelsblatt reported, citing Peter Hausmann,
an IG BCE labor-union board member.  The union is demanding a 7 percent wage increase for
550,000 workers in the  chemical industry , the newspaper said.
Regional negotiations have already started and countrywide talks
begin next week, Handelsblatt said.  The BAVC chemical-manufacturing employers association of  Germany  contends that, while production has recovered to the
level of early 2008, the economy hasnâ€™t rebounded, according to
the newspaper. The unions relinquished a monthly pay raise in
2010 negotiations, agreeing to a one-time payout of an average
of 550 euros ($770), which was equivalent to an average 1.2
percent wage increase, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
