  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
agreed to change rules that could make customers liable for the
lender’s errors related to account-payment instructions provided
via phone and fax, Britain’s financial regulator said.  The contract terms “were written so broadly” they could
have made customers accountable for legal claims against the
Edinburgh-based bank related to losses “directly attributable
to the firm’s own actions or negligence,” the  Financial Services
Authority  said in a statement today on its website.  The watchdog said it asked Britain’s antitrust regulator,
the  Office of Fair Trading , to analyze the proposed changes to
the rules to ensure they are in line with the country’s
competition laws.  RBS spokeswoman Sarah Elliott declined to immediately
comment when reached today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
