Hong Kong stocks rose, sending the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  to its highest close in more than a month, as
financial stocks gained and gold producers advanced on higher
prices for the metal.    China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the country’s second-biggest
lender by market value, increased 1.6 percent after Reuters said  China  canceled punitive increases of required reserves

percent after winning a bid for a building site. Zhaojin Mining
Industry Co., a gold miner based in China, jumped 3.5 percent.  The Hang Seng Index rose 1.7 percent to 23,711.70, the
highest close since Feb. 2, with all 45 stocks in the gauge
advancing. The index fell 0.4 percent yesterday as oil surged
amid escalating conflict in Libya, stoking concern that higher
fuel costs will damp the economic recovery. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of so-called H shares of Chinese companies
advanced 1.3 percent to 12,990.80 today.  “Fears over overseas factors are subsiding, and once  oil
prices  fall from their peak, that will provide a good excuse for
investors to buy into the market again,” said  Ben Kwong , chief
operating officer at KGI Asia Ltd. Some people see that
“China’s government is less likely to introduce further
tightening measures in the short term.”  China Construction Bank gained 1.6 percent to HK$7.06, the
second-biggest contributor to the Hang Seng Index’s advance.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (1288) , the nation’s largest lender to
farmers, increased 1.2 percent to HK$4.07.  Property Stocks  Cheung Kong, Hong Kong’s second-biggest builder by market

3.5 percent to HK$37.15 after the  South China Morning Post 
reported the company has allotted 500 million yuan ($76 million)
of its 2011 capital investment budget for the purchase of  gold
mines , citing Chairman Lu Dongshang. Zijin Mining Group Co.,
China’s largest gold producer, gained 0.8 percent to HK$6.65.  Gold Gains  Gold futures climbed to a record for the third time in a
week as escalating violence in Libya and concern that inflation
will accelerate boosted demand for the metal as an investment
haven. Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,434.50 in  New York  yesterday.    Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , controlled by billionaire Li Ka-
shing, rose 1.7 percent to HK$92.10. The company intends to
carry out “sizeable” investment in retail, property and other
areas this year, according to Managing Director Canning Fok. It
is planning a $5.83 billion sale of Chinese port assets in what
may be  Singapore ’s biggest initial public offering.  PetroChina Co., the nation’s No. 1 energy producer, gained
1.8 percent to HK$11.10 after Xinhua News Agency reported the

while PCCW Ltd. advanced 1.5 percent to HK$3.50 after the
brokerage rated the telecommunications company “neutral” in
new coverage.  The Hang Seng Index has risen 2.9 percent this year, as
corporate earnings and positive economic data from the U.S.
eased concern surging oil prices and tensions in the Middle East
will hamper global economic growth. Shares in the gauge traded
at an average 12.8 times estimated earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  While gold miners rose, other metal producers fell after
the London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including aluminum

sank 3.1 percent to HK$12.66. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1
producer of the metal, lost 1 percent to HK$24.75.    Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Ltd. (493) , China’s second-
