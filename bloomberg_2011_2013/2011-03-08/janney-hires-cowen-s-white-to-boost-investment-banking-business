Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, the
179-year-old Philadelphia brokerage, hired  Christopher White  as
managing director as it seeks to expand fixed-income, equities
and investment-banking businesses.  White, who’s taking over as head of investment banking, was
chief of staff at New York-based  Cowen Group Inc. (COWN) , Janney said
today in a statement. Andy Schmucker, the previous head of the
unit, will lead the mergers-and-acquisitions and sponsor-
coverage groups, the company said.  In December, Janney hired five fixed-income salesmen,
including former  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  executive Michael Stiuso, to
expand its capital-markets team, which has grown by more than
50 people since late 2008. White, who turns 46 tomorrow, said he
expects to hire more people for his unit.  “We need to make sure our senior bankers are spending more
time with clients and less time executing business themselves,”
White said in a telephone interview yesterday. ”We need some
qualified people to help.”  White, who will be based in  New York , received a bachelor’s
degree from Amherst College and a law degree from University of
Michigan Law School, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
