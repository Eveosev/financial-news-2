Silver, which outperformed gold,
platinum and palladium this year, may retreat from near a 31-
year peak as momentum weakens, according to  technical analysis 
by MF Global Holdings Ltd.  “The silver futures uptrend looks extended,” said Anantha Rajan, an analyst in  Singapore . “Bearish divergences in the
daily relative strength index, volume and open interest signal
caution,” Rajan said in an interview by phone today.  May-delivery silver fell 0.2 percent to $35.790 an ounce at
4:12 p.m. in Singapore. The price reached $36.745 yesterday, the
highest level for the most-active contract since March 1980.  The 14-day relative strength index, which compares gains
and losses on a daily basis, has traded above 70 for 13 days. A
level of more than 70 is seen by some investors as a signal that
prices are about to drop. Open interest in silver contracts that
have yet to be closed, liquidated or delivered dropped 13
percent in the week ended March 1, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  “It is targeting $37.91 ahead of trend channel resistance
around $39 where a short high may form,” Rajan said. Resistance
points are marked by clusters of orders to sell.  A reversal below the $34/$31.60 area would confirm weakness
and aim for $28.00/$26.30, Rajan said. The key level to watch
for the reversal is $31.69 an ounce, he said.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators cut their
net-long position in New York silver futures by 3 percent in the
week ended March 1, CFTC data show. Speculative long positions,
or bets prices will increase, outnumbered short positions by
37,902 contracts on the Comex division of the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the data show.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
