  Australia ’s dollar held losses from
the past three days as the climb in oil prices to a 29-month
high spurred concern that global economic growth may slow.  New Zealand’s dollar was 0.5 percent from the lowest level
since September versus the yen after data showed the South
Pacific nation’s budget deficit in the seven months through
January was wider than forecast. The so-called Aussie was
supported by a report showing business confidence was at the
highest level in almost a year.  “The Aussie has been lagging behind other commodity-
related currencies such as the krone and Canadian dollar,” said
Teppei Ino, an analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “As
Australia is an importer of oil, it doesn’t profit from surging  oil prices .”  Australia’s currency fetched $1.0122 as of 3:02 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0119 in  New York  yesterday. It bought 83.27 yen
from 83.21 yen.  The  New Zealand dollar  was at 73.84 U.S. cents from 73.69.
The currency traded at 60.74 yen from 60.60 yen yesterday, when
it touched 60.35 yen, the weakest level since Sept. 9.  Oil climbed to a 29-month high in New York yesterday as
fighting between Libyan rebels and troops loyal to  Muammar
Qaddafi  intensified, reigniting concern that supply disruptions
will spread through the Middle East.    Crude Oil   Crude oil for April delivery gained to $105.44 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since
Sept. 26, 2008. The contract is up 28 percent from a year ago.  “For the Australian dollar the near-term outlook will be
driven by the crude oil price,”  John Kyriakopoulos , head of
currency strategy in Sydney at National Australia Bank Ltd., the
nation’s largest lender, wrote in a note to clients today. “If
the sharp rise in oil isn’t reversed soon then stocks, risk
appetite and metals prices could continue to fall, knocking the
Australian dollar lower.”  The Aussie has lost 1.7 percent in the past month versus a
measure of currencies from 10 developed nations, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The Norwegian
krone has gained 2.9 percent and the Canadian dollar has
appreciated 1.1 percent.  National Australia Bank Ltd. said today its confidence
index advanced to 14 in February, the highest since March 2010,
from 4 a month earlier. The gauge was based on a survey of more
than 540 companies from Feb. 21-25.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will leave its key rate at
4.75 percent at its next meeting on April 5, according to all of
17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Swaps traders are
betting on a 31-basis-point increase over the next 12 months,
down from 47 basis points a month ago, according to a Credit
Suisse AG index.  ‘Early to Tell’  “There is nothing in this survey to shake the RBA’s
relaxed and comfortable stance,” Roland Randall, senior
strategist for foreign exchange and rates at TD Securities Inc.
in  Singapore , wrote in a note to clients. “While the surge in
confidence could signal the beginnings of a restoration in
business pricing power and thus inflationary pressures, it is
too early to tell.”    New Zealand ’s  Treasury Department  said today the cash
shortfall was NZ$10.15 billion ($7.5 billion) in the seven
months ended Jan. 31, or NZ$80 million wider than forecast in a
December fiscal update as a slowing economy curbed  tax revenue .  The  Reserve Bank of New Zealand  holds its next policy
meeting in Wellington on March 10. Ten of 14 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News predict the RBNZ will cut the official cash
rate, now at 3 percent, by at least 25 basis points.  Australian and New Zealand bonds fell as inflation concerns
curbed demand for the fixed payments of debt. Yields on the 10-
year Australian note rose four basis points to 5.56 percent,
while rates in the smaller nation also increased four basis
points to 5.63 percent.  Bonds linked to changes in consumer prices show annual
inflation in Australia will average 2.97 percent over the next
five years, the highest among global debt markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
