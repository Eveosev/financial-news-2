Quintiles Transnational Corp. will
meet with lenders on Thursday to discuss $2.43 billion of loans,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The loan is led by JPMorgan Chase & Co., said the people,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.  The provider of research and marketing services to
drugmakers will use proceeds to refinance $1.7 billion of
existing debt, including $525 million of 9.5 percent notes due
December 2014, the Triangle Park, North Carolina-based company
said in a statement distributed today by  Business Wire .  “The primary driver is favorable debt markets,” Phil
Bridges, a spokesman for Quintiles said in a telephone
interview. “If completed, the refinancing would enable
Quintiles to extend the maturity of its debt on much better
terms with similar overall  interest rates  in total.”  The financing will include a $225 million revolving  credit
line  due in 2016 and a $2.2 billion  term loan  due in 2018, the
company said.  Additional proceeds would be used for acquisitions, capital
investments, share repurchases or shareholder dividends, Bridges
said.  Quintiles has $952.5 million outstanding under a $1 billion
term loan due March 2013 and a $220 million second-lien facility
due March 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
debt paid 2 percentage points more than the London interbank
offered rate and 4 percentage points, respectively, more than
the lending benchmark when issued in 2006, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
