  South Korea ’s current-account
probably widened in February amid sustained export growth and a
narrowing travel deficit, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance
said in a monthly economic report released in Gwacheon today.  The surplus narrowed to an 11-month low of $229 million in
January as imports surged, from $2.11 billion in December. The
current account is the broadest measure of international trade,
tracking goods, services and investment income.  The government will act “flexibly” to sustain the
economic recovery amid rising uncertainties such as the Middle
East unrest, the possibility of monetary tightening in emerging
countries and  Europe ’s prolonged debt crisis, the ministry said,
also pledging to step up efforts to keep inflation expectations
from spreading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
