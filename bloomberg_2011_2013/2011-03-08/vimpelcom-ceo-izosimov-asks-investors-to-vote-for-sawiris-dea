  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  CEO Alexander
Izosimov asked shareholders to support a planned combination
with assets of Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris , saying the
deal would help it to expand in emerging markets and take
advantage of growing data sales and industry consolidation.  The company rejected a proposal by shareholder  Telenor ASA (TEL) 
to pay a extra dividend of $1.3 billion instead of the merger,
Izosimov said in a letter to shareholders dated March 7.
VimpelCom also said results from its Russian operations during
the first two months of 2011 have been “very encouraging.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
