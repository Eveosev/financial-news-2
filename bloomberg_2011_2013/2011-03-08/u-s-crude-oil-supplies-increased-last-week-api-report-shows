Crude oil inventories rose 5.69
million barrels last week to 356.4 million, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said today.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.95 million barrels to 220.4
million, the report showed.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Analysts expect the government report to show stockpiles of
crude oil increased over the period. Supplies probably advanced
1.5 million barrels, according to the median of 15 responses in
a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline inventories fell 2 million
barrels, the survey showed.  Oil-supply totals from the API and DOE have moved in the
same direction 75 percent of the time over the past four years.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Oil for May delivery rose 59 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$104.57 a barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The contract traded at $104.70 before
release of the report at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
