  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s Animas unit
recalled leaking insulin cartridges, saying they may cause pumps
to deliver too little medicine to patients.  Animas notified patients of the problem in a Feb. 24
 letter , saying the recall affects 2-milliliter cartridges
shipped between Nov. 30 and Jan. 4. A leaking cartridge may
prevent an insulin pump from sounding an alert over blockages in
the device’s infusion system, the letter said.  Animas said it learned of “several cases” of leaking
insulin and that any faulty cartridges would be replaced free of
charge. The recall covers five lots of cartridges.  J&J is based in  New Brunswick , New Jersey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
