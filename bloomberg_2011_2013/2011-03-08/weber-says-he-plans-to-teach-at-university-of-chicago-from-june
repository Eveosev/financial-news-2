Axel Weber said he plans to teach at
the  University of Chicago  after stepping down as president of
Germany’s Bundesbank next month.  “It looks like as if I will teach at the University of
Chicago” starting in June, Weber said at a press conference in
Frankfurt today after presenting the Bundesbank’s annual report.
“For a monetarist, that’s the prime address to go to.”  The University of Chicago was founded in 1890 by John D.
Rockefeller. It has earned at least 10 Nobel Memorial Prizes in
Economic Sciences over the past four decades, more than Columbia
University,  Harvard University , Princeton University and the  University of California , Berkeley.  Alumni of Chicago’s graduate business school include Jon
Corzine, the former chief executive officer of Goldman, Sachs &
Co., and Peter Peterson, the co-founded  Blackstone Group LP. (BX) 
U.S. President Barack Obama taught constitutional law at the
university for 12 years, stepping down when he was elected to
the U.S. Senate in 2004.  Weber said he’s currently negotiating his leave of absence
from the University of Cologne, where he has remained a faculty
member since joining the Bundesbank as president in 2004. He
declined to comment on whether he’ll take up a post at a large,
international commercial bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
