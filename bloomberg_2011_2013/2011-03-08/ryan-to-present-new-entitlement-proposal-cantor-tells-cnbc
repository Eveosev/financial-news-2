U.S. House Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan  will present a fiscal 2012 budget package to overhaul
entitlement programs including Social Security next month, House
Majority Leader Eric Cantor told CNBC today.  “It’s going to speak to how we see entitlements going,”
said Cantor, a Republican from  Virginia . “We’re going to say
‘Look, we’re going to protect the current retirees and those
nearing retirement but for the rest of us, those 54 and under,”
the programs “are going to look a lot different.’”  Cantor said lawmakers are still negotiating to reach a
compromise for the current 2011 budget before a March 18
deadline or risk a shutdown. “No one is for shutting down the
government,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
