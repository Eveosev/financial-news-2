South Korean lenders’ average
capital adequacy ratio fell in the fourth quarter after Hana
Bank helped finance its parent company’s purchase of  Korea
Exchange Bank. (004940)   The ratio, a measure of capital reserves against assets at
risk under the Basel II standard, slipped to 14.6 percent at the
end of December from 14.62 percent three months earlier, the
 Financial Supervisory Service  said in a statement. The average
Tier 1 ratio fell to 11.63 percent from 11.75 percent at the end
of September.  New Basel III capital rules agreed by global regulators
late last year will force banks to hold more equity and easy-to-
sell assets. While large Korean lenders weathered the global
financial crisis without needing state bailouts, a surge in
funding costs in international markets in late 2008 prompted the
government to guarantee bank debts.  Hana Bank, the main banking unit of  Hana Financial Group
Inc. (086790) , said Dec. 16 it will pay a dividend of 1.9 trillion won
($1.7 billion) to help fund its parent’s 4.7 trillion won
purchase of Korea Exchange Bank from Dallas-based Lone Star
Funds.  “The local banks’ capital adequacy ratio and Tier 1 ratio
surpassed our highest grade, staying quite healthy,” the FSS
said in the statement. The regulator said it will continue to
guide lenders to keep enough capital to accommodate for the new
Basel rules, set to be introduced from 2013.    Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s South Korean unit posted the highest
capital adequacy ratio among commercial lenders at 17.16 percent,
followed by 16.26 percent at Korea Exchange Bank, the FSS said.  The consolidated capital adequacy ratio among seven bank
holding companies including Woori Finance Holdings Co. and  KB
Financial Group Inc. (105560)  rose to 13.52 percent on Dec. 31 from 13.39
percent there months earlier, the regulator said in a separate
e-mailed statement. Their Tier 1 ratio stood at 10.38 percent,
up from 10.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
