Oil prices could take between six
months and a year to return to the “normal” range of $70 to
$80 a barrel,  Al-Seyassah  reported, citing Emad al-Ateeqi, a
member of  Kuwait ’s Supreme Petroleum Council.  On the other hand, unless there are political changes in
oil-producing countries, prices this year and next could reach
new highs, al-Ateeqi said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
