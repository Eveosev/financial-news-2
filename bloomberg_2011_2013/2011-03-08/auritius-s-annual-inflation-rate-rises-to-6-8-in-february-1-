Mauritius’s inflation rate rose to
6.8 percent in February, the highest since November 2008, adding
to pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates .  Inflation accelerated from 6.4 percent a month earlier, the
Port Louis-based Central Statistics Office said in a statement
on its website today. In the month, prices climbed 0.7 percent,
driven by food and transportation costs.  “About 60 to 70 percent of inflation is dictated by
foreign prices as Mauritius is a net importer of food and
fuel,” Kriti Taukoordass, an economist and partner at the
advisory firm Mazars, said in a phone interview from  Port Louis ,
the capital.  Inflation has accelerated for six consecutive months,
raising the possibility of an interest rate increase on March
28, when the Monetary Policy Committee next meets. The benchmark
repo rate was left unchanged at 4.75 percent on Dec. 6, while
central bank Governor Rundheersing Bheenick forecast the
inflation rate may rise to 7 percent in June 2011, prompting the
bank to take “appropriate measures.”  Global food prices jumped 34 percent to a record last month
from a year earlier, the  United Nations ’ Food and Agriculture
Organization said in a report on March 3.  Oil prices  are up 27
percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story: Kamlesh Bhuckory in Port
