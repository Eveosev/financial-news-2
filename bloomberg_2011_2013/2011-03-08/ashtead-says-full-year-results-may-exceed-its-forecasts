  Ashtead Group Plc (AHT) , the U.K.
construction-equipment rental company operating the Sunbelt
Rentals and A-Plant brands, said full-year results may exceed
its forecasts because of stronger revenue in  North America .  “We will beat our own forecasts,” Chief Executive Officer
Geoff Drabble said in a phone interview today. “The key story
is North America, when demand is uncertain and finance is tight,
people are renting instead of buying fleets.”  Drabble added that the North American  construction industry 
“has clearly bottomed and we expect to see a gentle recovery
starting in 2011.” About 80 percent of Ashtead’s sales are in
the U.S., he said.  Revenue in the fiscal third quarter for the three months to
Jan. 31 rose to 221.4 million pounds ($358 million) from 187.3
million pounds a year earlier, the London-based company said in
a Regulatory News Service statement. The net loss narrowed to
1.2 million pounds from 9.2 million pounds.  Ashtead shares advanced 15.5 pence, or 8.3 percent, to 202
pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , giving the company a
market value of 1.02 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
