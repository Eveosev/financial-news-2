The U.S. Federal Trade Commission
said the most common complaints that consumers registered with
the agency last year involved  identity theft .  Of 1.3 million complaints filed with the FTC in 2010,
250,854, or 19 percent, were related to identity theft, the
agency said in an e-mailed statement today. Debt-collection
complaints came in second with 144,159 filings, or 11 percent of
the total, according to a report posted at the FTC  website .  The report breaks down complaint data on a state-by-state
basis and includes data about the 50 metropolitan areas
reporting the highest per capita incidence of fraud and other
complaints.  For the first time, scams in which imposters posed as
friends, family, respected companies or government agencies to
get people to send money were among the top 10 biggest issues
consumers filed complaints about.  To contact the reporter on this story:
