Treasuries fell as crude oil dropped
from almost its highest level since September 2008 and stocks
rose, reducing demand for the safety of government debt.  The yield difference between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations for
consumer prices over the life of the securities, touched 2.56
percentage points, the widest in 32 months. Three-year notes
pared losses as the U.S. government’s $32 billion auction of the
debt drew the highest demand since November.  “Prices are down a little bit on the stock market, but
mostly the supply,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New
York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., one of the 20
primary dealers obligated to bid in U.S. debt sales. “It was a
great auction. It got cheap enough to attract buyers.”  Benchmark 10-year note yields advanced four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.55 percent at 5:01 p.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 3.625
percent security due in February 2021 slid 9/32, or $2.81 per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 20/32.  The yield on the current 3-year note gained one basis point
to 1.22 percent after earlier rising four basis points to 1.24
percent. The 30-year bond yield increased four basis points to
4.67 percent.  At today’s 3-year note auction, the securities drew a yield
of 1.298 percent, compared with the average forecast of 1.305
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 8 primary dealers.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.22, the
highest level since November.  Indirect Bidders  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 34.4 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 38.9 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.3 percent of
the notes, compared with the 10-auction average of 14.5 percent.  “Today indicates investors are more comfortable parking
funds in the short end for weeks rather than days,”  Jim Vogel ,
head of agency-debt research at FTN Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , wrote in a research note to clients. “The overall
arc, then, of this auction removes some of the anxiety about
tomorrow’s 10-year.”  The government plans to sell $21 billion of 10-year notes
tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds a day later for a
total of $66 billion.  U.S. Debt Losses  Three-year notes have lost 0.1 percent this year, compared
with a 1 percent drop for 10-year notes and a 0.4 percent
decrease for the broader Treasury market, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  “We should continue to be cheap heading into the longer-
end auctions given the atmosphere as risk comes back,” said  John Briggs , a U.S. government bond strategist in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at Royal Bank of  Scotland ’s RBS Securities Inc., a
primary dealer.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.9 percent after
falling 1.6 percent over the past two trading days. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  gained 1.1 percent.  Crude oil for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  dropped for the first time in three days, falling 0.6
percent to $104.82 a barrel. Kuwait’s oil minister, Sheikh Ahmad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, told reporters in Kuwait City today that
OPEC members are discussing whether to hold an emergency meeting
on possibly increasing production.  Futures reached $106.95 yesterday, the highest level since
Sept. 26, 2008, as Libyan warplanes bombed rebel positions near
a crude-producing hub.  Roubini on Oil  An increase in  oil prices  to $140 a barrel will cause some
advanced economies to slide back into recession, according to  Nouriel Roubini , the economist who predicted the global
financial crisis.  The  European Central Bank  may be making a mistake by
raising  interest rates  “too soon” when debt-ridden countries
on the euro region’s periphery struggle to restore the
competitiveness of exports, Roubini told reporters in Dubai.  Greek 10-year bond yields and credit-default swaps surged
to a record as borrowing costs increased at a $2.3 billion sale
of treasury bills. Greek bonds extended declines to a ninth day
after the nation’s credit rating was cut by Moody’s Investors
Service yesterday.  The yield on 10-year Greek bonds jumped as much as 48 basis
points to 12.82 percent, the most since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 1988.  The U.S. central bank purchased $7.7 billion of Treasuries
maturing from September 2016 to February 2018 today as part of
its plan to sustain the recovery by pumping $600 billion into
the economy.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  didn’t rule out in
congressional testimony last week expanding the central bank’s
asset purchases, saying he doesn’t want to see the U.S. fall
back into a recession.  To contact the reporters on this story:
