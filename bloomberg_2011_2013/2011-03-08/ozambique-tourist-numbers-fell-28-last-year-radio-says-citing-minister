The number of tourists visiting  Mozambique  fell 28 percent last year from a year earlier, Radio
Mozambique reported, citing Tourism Minister Fernando Sumbana.  The decline in visitor numbers was partly due to the global
financial crisis and also three-day food riots in the southern
African nation, the Maputo-based broadcaster reported. It didnâ€™t
give details on how many tourists visited Mozambique in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
