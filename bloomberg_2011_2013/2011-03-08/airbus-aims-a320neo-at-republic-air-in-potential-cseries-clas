Airbus SAS said it’s in talks with
Republic Airways Holding Inc. about an order for A320neo jets,
potentially boosting sales momentum for the narrow-body airliner
three months after its introduction.  Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy declined to
discuss details of a possible agreement in a telephone interview
today. The A320neo features improved engines that burn less
fuel.  “The world’s airlines are taking the A320neo very
seriously,” Leahy said in the interview. With 302 commitments
for the plane, the A320 is enjoying the “fastest rate of sales
we’ve ever seen.”  Republic, which owns Frontier Airlines and four regional
carriers, already flies Airbus A320 and A319 jets. Frontier
operates regularly scheduled flights under its own name, while
Republic’s other airlines ferry passengers to hubs for five
major U.S. carriers.  “As current Airbus customers, we are major advocates of
more-fuel-efficient aircraft and we are discussing the Neo with
them,” Carlo Bertolini, a spokesman for Indianapolis-based
Republic, said in an e-mail today. “We don’t have any specifics
beyond that.”  ’Loyal Customer’  Republic agreed in February 2010 to buy 40  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) 
CSeries regional jets valued at $3.06 billion. Both Bombardier
and Airbus market their new single-aisle jets as more fuel
efficient upgrades of existing models. The CSeries has received
no new orders since Republic’s order.  “Republic is a valued and loyal customer and we look
forward to delivering CSeries to them,” Bombardier spokesman  John Arnone  said.    American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s jet-leasing unit said
today it will buy 100 Airbus aircraft and 33  Boeing Co. (BA)  737s,
$11.8 billion in planes at list prices. International Lease
Finance Corp. said its deal with Airbus consists of 75 A320neo
narrow-body jets and 25 A321neo planes. That replaces a plan to
buy 10 A380 superjumbo jets, which list for about $375 million
each.  Airbus has won several commitments or orders for the
A320neo since introducing the aircraft in December. Indian low-
cost carrier IndiGo pledged in January to buy 150 of the
A3230neo. Billionaire  Richard Branson ’s Virgin America Inc. said
the same month that it would buy 30 of the revamped planes as
well as 30 of the current model.  The Airbus A320neo comes with a geared turbofan engine
built by  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt & Whitney unit and
the Leap-X from  CFM International , the venture of  General
Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA (SAF)  of  France .  To contact the reporters on this story:
