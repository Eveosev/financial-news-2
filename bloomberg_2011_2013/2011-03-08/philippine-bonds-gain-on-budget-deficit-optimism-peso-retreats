Philippine bonds rose, pushing the
yield on three-year notes to a one-month low, on optimism the
nation’s budget deficit will shrink this year. The peso fell,
extending its retreat from a four-month high.  The government will “increase revenue collections and
enhance spending efficiency,” Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima
said yesterday after reporting a record deficit for 2010. The
shortfall was 314.4 billion pesos ($7.25 billion), less than the
official target of 325 billion pesos, and the government aims to
narrow the gap to 300 billion pesos this year.  “Their success last year sends a clear signal that this
administration is serious about managing the deficit and that is
boosting the confidence of investors,” said Angeline Sia, a
fixed-income trader who helps manage the equivalent of $11
billion at BPI Asset Management Inc. in  Manila .  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 dropped
five basis points to 5.20 percent as of 3:16 p.m. in Manila, the
lowest level since Feb. 8, according to Tradition Financial
Services. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “We are confident that this year’s fiscal targets will be
met,” Purisima said yesterday in a statement. The government
has “a lot of funding options” and “there’s no reason for  interest rates  to go up,” he told reporters separately.  The Philippine peso dropped 0.4 percent to 43.46 per dollar
in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached
43.268 on March 4, the strongest level since Nov. 10.  To contact the reporter for this story:
