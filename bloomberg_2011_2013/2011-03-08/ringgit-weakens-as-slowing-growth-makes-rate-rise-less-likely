Malaysia’s ringgit weakened for a
second day on speculation slowing economic growth will make the
central bank less likely to raise borrowing costs.  The currency retreated from near a 13-year high before a
government report this week that economists predict will show
factory output in January grew at the slowest pace in 14 months.

in three months, the trade ministry said on March 4. This year’s
14 percent rally in  oil prices  may also hurt the economy.  Government bonds  declined ahead next week’s debt sale.  “The money market is cautious about taking on risk because
higher oil prices from the Middle East tension could affect the

stronger today.”  The ringgit fell 0.2 percent to 3.0330 per dollar as of

Malaysia’s gross domestic product increased 4.8 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, the slowest in a year.    Bank Negara Malaysia  will keep its overnight rate at 2.75
percent when it meets on March 11, according to 15 of 19
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Four predicted an increase to
3 percent. Policy makers have not changed the rate since July.  Bond Auction  There is a “tremendous focus” on achieving growth and job
creation and current policy rates are supportive of that,
Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said in Kuala Lumpur on March 3.  Five-year bonds fell for a fourth day as the government
prepares to sell more debt this month to fund its  budget
