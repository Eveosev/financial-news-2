  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s patent-infringement
claims against  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  over liquid-crystal display
televisions and monitors will be investigated by a U.S. trade
agency that has the power to block imports of LG’s products.  By agreeing to investigate a complaint filed by Sony on
Feb. 9, the U.S. International Trade Commission “has not made
any decision on the merits of the case,” the Washington-based
agency said in a  statement  today.  Sony, Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics, is
seeking to block U.S. imports of some of Seoul-based LG’s LCD
televisions and monitors as the companies fight over technology
and market share. LG has a claim pending before the ITC where it
seeks to block U.S. sales of Sony Bravia televisions and
PlayStation 3 consoles, claiming they use patented technology
without permission.  Sony, based in Tokyo, has also filed patent-infringement
lawsuits against LG in federal court in  Los Angeles .  The case is In the Matter of Certain Display Devices,
Including Digital Televisions and Monitors II, 337-765, U.S.
International Trade Commission (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
