  Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760) , South
Korea’s biggest electricity producer, plans to invest 2 trillion
won ($1.8 billion) over the next five years in a smart grid as
part of the government’s efforts to reduce  carbon emissions .  Adding two-way communications and other enhancements to the
nation’s current power-transmission grid nationwide by 2030 may
cut about 10 percent of South Korea’s annual power consumption,
which currently is worth 37 trillion won, according to Hong Sung Eui, the utility’s head of strategy for the technology.  “A smart grid, which helps cut energy consumption and
accommodate more wind and solar power, is essential for reducing
harmful gases as the power sector is the biggest emitter in
every country,” Hong said in an interview yesterday.    South Korea ,  Asia ’s fourth-largest energy user, has said
the state and private industry may spend about 27.5 trillion won
by 2030 building smart grids. The technologies aim at enabling
consumers to get real-time price and supply data and providing
incentives to reduce power use during peak-demand periods. The
system also should allow the network to better integrate
fluctuations of supply from wind- and sun-based generators.  “The upgraded  power grid  will help the nation, which buys
all its energy needs from overseas, reduce import of coal, gas
and oil,” Kim Seung Woo, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co.,
said by phone today. Korea Electric doesn’t have to build costly
plants to meet a surge in demand, Kim said.  Korea Electric fell 0.9 percent to 27,350 won in Seoul
trading, compared with a 0.8 percent increase in the benchmark  Kospi index. (KOSPI)  The stock fell 11 percent in 2010.    Renewable Energy   Korea Electric will spend 4.9 trillion won by 2030 on
upgrading the transmission and distribution system, and 1.4
trillion won on expanding the use of renewable energy, according
to Hong. South Korea aims to boost the use of renewable energy
including solar and wind to 11 percent of total power supplies
by 2030 from 2 percent.  The government said in 2009 that it would voluntarily
reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent from the expected 2020
level, or 4 percent below its emissions in 2005. Power accounts
for about 40 percent of total emissions, according to data from
the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy .  Korea Electric is also seeking to export smart grid
technologies and is targeting sales of $4 billion annually from
overseas markets, starting 2030, said Jung Choon Sik, senior
manager of its overseas project technology development team. The
company is in talks with a Russian power company to export
smart-grid equipment, Korea Electric said on March 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
