Poland’s plan to cut transfers to
private pension funds, already delayed by a month, may not be in
place until the second half of 2011, posing a threat to the
fiscal-deficit goal, Citigroup Inc.’s Polish unit said.  The government, which is to hold its final sitting on the
plan in Warsaw today, has been told by its lawyers that the
proposed changes may breach the constitution,  TVN CNBC  said,
citing the legal department of the prime minister’s office.  The government initially wanted the law to take effect on
April 1, seeking to reduce the  budget deficit  to about 6 percent
of gross domestic product this year from 7.9 percent in 2010 to
keep public debt from topping a legal limit that would trigger
mandatory spending cuts. The pension changes will help lower
borrowing needs by 12 billion zloty ($4.2 billion) this year,
the Finance Ministry estimates.  Disputes with economists, labor unions and employers, as
well as within the government itself, led to a one-month delay.
The latest legal advise that such changes can’t be implemented
for several months suggest the government may save less money in
its deficit-cutting effort than it’s targeting.  “This shows the government may be unable to achieve
planned savings,” said  Piotr Kalisz , chief economist at
Citigroup’s Bank Handlowy SA unit, who assumes a six-month delay
would mean the fiscal deficit will rise by almost 0.5 percent of
GDP this year. He forecasts this year’s shortfall at around 6.5
percent of GDP.  According to the  Finance Ministry , each month of delay
implies spending will increase by 0.07 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
