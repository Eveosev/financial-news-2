  Puda Coal Inc. (PUDA)  call trades rose to a
record level after the coal-washing company participated in
Rodman & Renshaw Capital Group Inc.’s investment conference in  Shanghai  yesterday.  More than 17,300 calls to buy the stock changed hands
today, 20.4 times the four-week average and 10 times the number
of puts to sell. The most-traded contracts were the April $12
calls, which accounted for almost four-fifths of all call volume
and rose 33 percent to $1.40. Those contracts had an open
interest of 860 before today.  The company, based in the Chinese province of Shanxi,
advanced 4.9 percent to $12.57. It gained 31 percent in the past
year, compared with a 16 percent increase for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index. Puda’s implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose
to 66.72 from 61.13 yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
