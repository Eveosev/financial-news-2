Thailand, the world’s second-largest
sugar exporter, sold 92,000 metric tons to Louis Dreyfus
Commodities, Mitsubishi Corp., Itochu and Noble Resources at an
auction, according to state-owned Thai Cane and Sugar Corp.  Louis Dreyfus bought 24,000 tons, with a premium of 95
points more than the New York price for shipment between March 1
and May 15, 2012, Surat Thadachawasakul, the company’s general
manager, said by phone today. Mitsubishi will pay a premium of
95 points on 8,000 tons with the same delivery period, he added.
A point is 100th of a cent per pound.  Itochu will buy 36,000 tons at 205 points more than the New
York price at the time of delivery and Noble Resources will pay
a premium of 123 points on 24,000 tons, Surat said. The delivery
of these two shipments will be between May 1 and July 15, 2012,
he said.  The sales were less than the planned 120,000 tons announced
last week.  Thai Cane and Sugar offers 400,000 tons of so-called quota-
B sugar for sale a year to trading firms under long-term
contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
