Japanese  stock futures  advanced as
oil retreated, easing concern higher energy costs will impede
the economic recovery. Australian shares declined.  American depositary receipts of Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,
Japan’s third-biggest publicly traded lender, gained 1.4 percent
from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Canon Inc., the
world’s largest camera maker, advanced 0.8 after the yen
weakened against dollar, boosting the earnings outlook for
exporters. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company,
dropped 1.2 percent in Sydney.  “Crude oil futures stopped rising for the moment and
that’s eased uncertainty somewhat,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an
equities manager at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. in Tokyo.
“The global economy is recovering and companies are showing
better earnings.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in

10,570 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index declined 0.3 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index increased 0.9 percent yesterday in  New
York , snapping a two-day decline, after Bank of America Corp.,
the largest U.S. lender, said its home-loan business is in
“recovery mode.”  OPEC Discussions  Crude oil fell from a 29-month high yesterday as members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries discussed
whether to hold a special meeting to consider increasing oil
production. Oil for April delivery dropped 42 cents to settle at
$105.02 a barrel in New York.  The yen depreciated to as low as 82.86 against the dollar
last night in Tokyo, compared with 82.28 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday, boosting overseas income at Japanese
companies when repatriated.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5.1 percent by the  S&P
500  and 2.2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.9 times estimated earnings on
average as of the last close, compared with 13.7 times for the
