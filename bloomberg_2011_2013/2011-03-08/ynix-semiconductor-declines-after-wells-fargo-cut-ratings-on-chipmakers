Hynix Semiconductors Inc. dropped
after  Wells Fargo & Co . reduced its recommendation on the
semiconductor industry yesterday. Hynix fell 1.9 percent to
28,350 won as of 10:13 a.m. on the Korea Exchange, while the
benchmark Kospi index gained 0.5 percent. Wells Fargo cut its
industry rating to “market weight” from “overweight,” citing
the 125 percent gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index
