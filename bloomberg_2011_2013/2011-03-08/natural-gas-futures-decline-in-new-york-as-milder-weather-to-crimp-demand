Natural gas futures declined for the
first day in three on forecasts of warmer-than-normal weather
that may crimp demand for the heating fuel.  Gas dropped as much as 1.8 percent in  New York  as
temperatures may be above-normal across most of the continental
U.S. from March 14 through March 18. Temperatures may be up to 8
degrees above normal in the central U.S., according to WSI Corp.
in Andover, Massachusetts.  “As we get into the warmer weather and you start to see a
substantial drop in heating demand, I do think the market will
start to grind lower,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker with Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “I think
we’ll definitely see the $3.50 area.”  Natural gas for April delivery fell 4.9 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.878 per million British thermal units at 9:02
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures have
declined 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
