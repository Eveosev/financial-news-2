  Kuwait  plans to boost its refining
capacity by 56 percent to 1.45 million barrels a day within the
next five years, the head of the state-owned  oil company  said.  Kuwait plans to build a refinery with the capacity to
process 615,000 barrels a day of crude, Farouq Al-Zanki, chief
executive officer of the Kuwait Petroleum Corp., said today at
the  IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates  conference in
Houston. Current capacity is 930,000 barrels a day, he said.  Kuwait also intends to build two olefins plants as part of
a plan to spend $270 billion on capital projects in the next 20
years, Al-Zanki said in a plenary session at CERAWeek 2011.  Al-Jarida newspaper reported last month, without saying
where it got the information, that Kuwait’s Supreme Petroleum
Council might approve building a fourth  oil refinery . The SPC is
the country’s highest decision-making body for oil policy.
