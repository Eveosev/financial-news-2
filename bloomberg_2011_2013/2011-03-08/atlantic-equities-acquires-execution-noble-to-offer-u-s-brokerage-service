Atlantic Equities LLP , a U.K.
provider of U.S. stock research and trading, acquired New York-
based brokerage Execution Noble LLC to enter the U.S.,
executives from both companies said.  The combined entity will keep London-based Atlantic’s name
and provide research and trading services in both the U.S. and
U.K., according to Christopher Middleton, the chief executive
officer of Atlantic, and Execution Noble’s Gary Cunningham, 46,
who will be a managing partner.  "It’s going to be two ways, not just us going into the U.S.
with our research product," Middleton, 44, said. "We have an
interesting angle by bringing a European flavor to U.S.
research."  Execution Noble is a former unit of Execution Noble Ltd., a
London-based brokerage that was bought last year by  Portugal ’s  Banco Espirito Santo SA. (BES)  The U.S. Federal Reserve required
Lisbon-based Banco Espirito to sell the New York-based unit to
gain approval for the deal, said Cunningham, who was CEO of the
Execution unit in New York.  "We’ll add our expertise of trading and sales trading to
theirs and look to add a limited number of salespeople in the
U.S. to sell the product to key accounts here," Cunningham said.  Atlantic has 32 employees in the U.K. and Execution has
nine in the U.S., Middleton said. He has been CEO of the company
since 2003, when it was spun off by Cazenove Group Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
