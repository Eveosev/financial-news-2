  SacOil Holding Ltd. (SCL)  advanced, poised
for its highest closing level in almost 14 years, after saying
it has received approval to list on the London Stock Exchangeâ€™s
Alternative Investment Market.  The stock rose as much as 7 cents, or 2.7 percent, to 2.64
rand. It traded up 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, at 2.59 rand as of
11 a.m. in Johannesburg. A close at that level would be the
highest since May 1997.  The company, an oil and natural gas explorer developing
wells in  Nigeria  and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said
it will not be raising any new capital with the listing in
April. SacOil has a market value of 1.5 billion rand ($218
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
