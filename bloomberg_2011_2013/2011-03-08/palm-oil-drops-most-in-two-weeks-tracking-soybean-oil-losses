  Palm oil  dropped for the first time
in six days, tracking losses in rival soybean oil, which fell on
speculation that rain in  Argentina  may aid crops.  The May-delivery contract slumped 3 percent to close at
3,584 ringgit ($1,181) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the most since Feb. 23. Futures gained 6.4 percent in
five days before today, the longest winning run this year.  “There was a sharp decline in soybeans on expectations
that rains in Argentina will boost production,” said  Veeresh Hiremath , associate chief analyst with Karvy Comtrade Ltd. in
the Indian city of Hyderabad. “The drop in crude oil is also
pressuring the market.”  Soybeans for May delivery declined 1.3 percent to $13.95 a
bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade, the most in more
than two weeks. Futures shed as much as 1.2 percent today and
traded at $13.8225 at 6:10 p.m. in  Singapore . Soybean oil for
May delivery retreated as much as 1.4 percent to 58.30 cents a
pound and traded at 58.34 cents at 6:13 p.m. in Singapore.  Palm and soybean oils are substitutes in food and fuel
uses, and prices can be influenced by shifts in energy costs.  Oil fell for the first time in three days after a report
that  Libya ’s Muammar Qaddafi offered to give up power prompted
speculation that fighting may ease in  Africa ’s third-biggest
producer. Crude dropped as much as 2 percent to $103.33 a barrel
after al-Jazeera reported the proposal that guaranteed safe
passage for the leader and his family. The interim rebel council
rejected the offer, the TV channel said, without stating how it
obtained the information.  Palm oil may track volatility in crude  oil prices  as unrest
in the Middle East spreads and weather uncertainties continue,
according to Chong Kim Seng, chief executive officer of Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives Bhd.  ‘Plugged Into Energy’  “If you go back to when palm oil was seen as a food crop,
it was very stable, no volatility, but once you get plugged in
to the energy sector, you never know,” Seng said yesterday in
an interview.  Futures, which reached a 35-month high of 3,967 ringgit on
Feb. 10, will be “volatile” in the next few months, Ling Ah
Hong, director of Ganling Sdn Bhd., said at a conference in
Kuala Lumpur today. Prices will average 3,100 ringgit this year,
and may drop as low as 2,700 ringgit in the second half, Ling
said. The price has averaged about 3,726 ringgit this year.  Palm oil output in  Malaysia , the second-biggest producer,
will expand to 17.59 million tons this year, from 16.99 million
last year, as yields improve, Malaysia Plantation & Commodities
Minister Bernard Dompok said at the conference today.  September-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  declined 1.6 percent to 9,490 yuan ($1,445) a ton, the
lowest close in a week, and soybean oil for delivery in the same
month shed 1.7 percent to 10,252 yuan.  CME Group Inc.’s most-active June palm-oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, shed as much as 1.8 percent to
$1,171.25 a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
