Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in the Americas, plans to offer as much as $1.38 billion of
notes convertible to its U.S. shares, raising funds to pay debt.  The Monterrey, Mexico-based company will offer $600 million
of notes that mature in 2016 and an equal amount due in 2018,
according to a statement today. The financial institutions
managing the sales will have over-allotment options to purchase
$90 million in notes for each issue, Cemex said.  Shareholders of Cemex agreed on Feb. 24 to create the
equivalent of 200 million new American depositary shares to
support the sale of convertible notes. Those shares are valued
at $1.78 billion at today’s closing price.  Cemex has sold assets and shares in the past three years to
reduce debt after Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Zambrano bought companies for more than two decades, including
the $14.2 billion acquisition of Rinker Group in 2007, to build
Cemex from a regional Mexican cement maker in the mid-1980s into
one of the world’s largest.  The convertible notes are exempt from registration under
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, Cemex said. The notes also
won’t be registered under  Mexico ’s stock exchange authority and
can’t be offered in that country.  The company said it plans to enter into capped call
transactions that are designed to reduce the cost to Cemex when
the notes are converted to shares. Capped calls are options that
are automatically exercised at a predetermined price for the
underlying stock.  Cemex didn’t disclose the brokers involved in the notes
offer.  Cemex’s U.S. shares rose 1.7 percent to $8.89 today in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped
17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Thomas Black  in Monterrey at
