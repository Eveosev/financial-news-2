South African business confidence
rose to a three-year high in the first quarter as manufacturers
benefited from stronger vehicle sales and a jump in exports,
Rand Merchant Bank said.  The index increased to 55 from 44 in the fourth quarter,
the investment bank, a unit of  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , said in an e-mail
today. A reading above 50 indicates more companies are
optimistic than are pessimistic about prevailing business
conditions, the bank said.  “This is a good sign since improved levels of business
confidence typically lead capital expenditure which, in turn, is
an encouraging prospect” for economic growth, RMB’s Chief
Economist Ettienne le Roux said in the statement.  The recovery in  Africa ’s biggest economy has strengthened,
with growth accelerating to an annualized 4.4 percent in the
fourth quarter from 2.7 percent in the previous three months,
the statistics office said on Feb. 22. Vehicle sales surged 25
percent in 2010, helping to spur manufacturing, which accounts
for 15 percent of the economy.  The confidence index for manufacturers climbed 10 points to
51 in the first quarter, while the motor trade index increased
to a five-year high of 84, RMB said. There was no sign of
recovery in the building industry, with the index dropping from
20 to 18, the lowest level in more than a decade, the bank said.  The business confidence index is compiled by RMB and the
University of Stellenbosch’s Bureau for Economic Research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
