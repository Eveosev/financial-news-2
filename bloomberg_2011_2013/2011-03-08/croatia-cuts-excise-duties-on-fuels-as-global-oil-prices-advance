Croatia lowered excise duties by
0.15 kuna (0.3 cents) on the most common retail fuels to help
citizens cope with rising global prices.  The measure will last till the end of the year, the
government said in an e-mailed statement today. In addition to
excise duties, a 23 percent value-added tax is levied on fuel.  The lower duties may cost the government 25 million kuna a
month in forfeited tax receipts, said Jasminko Umicevic, a gas
analyst at London-based Oil & Gas Consulting Ltd, in a phone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jasmina Kuzmanovic at
