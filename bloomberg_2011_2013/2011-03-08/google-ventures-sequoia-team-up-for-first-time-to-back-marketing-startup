Google Ventures is teaming up with  Sequoia Capital  for the first time to provide $32 million in
funding for  HubSpot Inc. , a startup that helps businesses market
themselves through search engines and social media.    Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , which sells online software for
customer-relationship management, also is part of the funding
round for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based HubSpot, according to a
statement today. Sequoia invested in  Google Inc. (GOOG)  in 1999, along
with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Google Ventures already
has invested in other companies with Kleiner Perkins.  “We agree with HubSpot’s belief that search engines,
social media and mobile devices have fundamentally changed how
businesses should market themselves,” Rich Miner, a partner at
Mountain View, California-based Google Ventures, said in the
statement. “We’re thrilled to support their efforts.”  Google Ventures aims to put about $100 million a year into
startups, seeking financial returns for its parent company, the
world’s biggest Internet-search provider. The investments, which
cover everything from mobile devices to the environment, range
from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars.  HubSpot’s existing investors, including General Catalyst
Partners, Matrix Partners and Scale Venture Partners, also
participated in the latest financing round. HubSpot sells
software to small and mid-size businesses that assist with
search-engine optimization, website management and blogging. The
company has more than 4,000 customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
