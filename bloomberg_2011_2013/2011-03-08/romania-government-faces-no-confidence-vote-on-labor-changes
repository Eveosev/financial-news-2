  Romania ’s main opposition parties
will file a no-confidence motion against the government today
after Prime Minister Emil Boc proposed that lawmakers approve
labor legislation through a fast-track process.  A vote on whether to proceed with the no-confidence motion,
put forward by the Liberals and the  Social Democrats , will
likely be taken on March 16, according to Mircea Toader, the
head of the ruling party’s parliamentary group.  The coalition led by Boc, who survived four no-confidence
votes in 2010 over his administration’s austerity measures, has
247 votes in the 470-seat Parliament. The opposition needs 236
votes to oust the government. The lawmakers of the ruling
coalition have already said they will not vote.  “The changes to the labor legislation meet the country’s
needs to create jobs more easily,” Boc said today in
Parliament. “This is neither the first nor the last no-
confidence motion and I am confident the government will
survive.”  The government wants fast-track approval of changes to the
labor law to make the legislation more flexible. The law would
introduce contracts for temporary workers and increase sanctions
for black market labor while insuring higher social protection
for employees as agreed with the  International Monetary Fund  and
the  World Bank .  Under the fast-track process, the opposition must file a
no-confidence motion within three days or the proposed
legislation automatically is approved.  To contact the reporters on this story:
