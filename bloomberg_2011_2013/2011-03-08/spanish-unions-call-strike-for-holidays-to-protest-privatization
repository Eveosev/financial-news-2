Spanish unions called a strike
during the spring and summer holiday season to protest
government plans to privatize airport operator Aena.  The plan, which was registered with the Labor Ministry
today, calls for Aena employees to hold work stoppages during
the Easter holiday week in April, five days in May, three days
in June, six days in July and three days in August, said a
spokesman at the Comisiones Obreras union in  Madrid  who declined
to be named in line with policy.  Spain’s government, which is struggling to reduce one of  Europe ’s largest budget deficits, plans to sell as much as 49
percent of Aena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
