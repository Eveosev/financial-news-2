Angola has the capacity to pump 1.9
million barrels a day of crude, Oil Minister Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos said in a speech at CERAWeek, an IHS Cambridge
Energy Research Associates conference in Houston.  Production is below that level because of operational
issues and the countryâ€™s commitment to OPEC, he said. In
comments to reporters after the speech, Botelho de Vasconcelos
said output capacity was 2.1 million barrels a day.  Angolan capacity was 2.05 million barrels a day in
February, according to Bloomberg estimates. It pumped 1.6
million barrels a day, above its OPEC target of 1.52 million.  The African country produces 1.6 to 1.7 million barrels a
day, the minister said.  To contact the reporters on this story: Margot Habiby in Houston
