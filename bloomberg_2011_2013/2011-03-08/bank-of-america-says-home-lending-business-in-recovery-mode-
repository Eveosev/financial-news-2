  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest
U.S. lender, said its residential mortgage business is in
“recovery mode” after contributing to a net loss last year and
will be “transitioning to business as usual” in 2012. The
stock advanced in early trading.  The commercial- and investment-banking businesses are
already transitioning this year and may post what the company
considers normalized earnings in 2012 and 2013, Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America said today in a  slide show  on its
website.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan , hosting the
lender’s first investor day since 2007, is seeking to assure
investors the bank will return to profitability as the economy
stabilizes and the company recovers from disputes with investors
over soured mortgages. The company’s net loss last year was
driven by writedowns at credit-card and home-lending units
acquired by Moynihan’s predecessor,  Kenneth D. Lewis .  “We are changing the culture of the company from a company
that was built upon acquisitions and consolidation,” Moynihan
said today in  New York . “We are again a growth company.”  Bank of America climbed 23 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $14.26
