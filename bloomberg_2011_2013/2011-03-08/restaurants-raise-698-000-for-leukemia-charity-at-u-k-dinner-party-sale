London chefs helped raise a total of
431,000 pounds ($698,000) for leukemia care last night when they
cooked a meal and auctioned their services for private dining in
the annual  Leuka  charity dinner in London.  Rainer Becker of Zuma attracted a top bid of 26,000 pounds
to prepare a dinner party for 10 people. Pierre Koffmann of
Koffmann’s took 20,000 pounds,  Richard Corrigan  of Corrigan’s
Mayfair 18,000 pounds and Nuno Mendes of Viajante 17,000 pounds,
event producer Elly Dymond said today in an e-mailed release.  The leukemia charity hosted the evening at the Four Seasons
Hotel, at which chefs cook for a table of 10, for which guests
pay 6,000 pounds. The diners don’t know whose four-course menu
they will get until a draw is conducted on the night.  Of the other chefs: Tom Aikens (Tom Aikens) fetched 12,000
pounds; Mark Edwards (Nobu) 16,000 pounds; Peter Gordon (Kopapa)
13,000 pounds; Phil Howard (The Square) 16,000 pounds; Mark Hix

pounds; Tong Chee Hwee (Hakkasan) 16,000 pounds; Marcus Wareing

Holdings Ltd.; Nicola Horlick, chief executive of Bramdean Asset

the Catherine Lewis Centre at the Hammersmith Hospital, which it
helped build. Money was also raised from an auction and a
raffle.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
