  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) ’s four-drug
combination eliminated hepatitis C virus in patients in an
early-stage study, RBC Capital Markets LLC analysts said.  The findings support an ongoing mid-stage study of the
combination, the analysts, led by  Michael Yee  in  San Francisco ,
wrote yesterday in a note to investors, citing an abstract of
the trial. The analysts said they expect data next year from a
mid-stage study by the Foster City, California-based company.  The early-stage study examined a combination of Gilead’s
GS-9256 and GS-9190 with two older drugs that are the standard
of care, ribavirin and Peg-interferon, according to the note.  The data will be presented at the annual meeting of the
European Association for the Study of the Liver starting March
30 in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
