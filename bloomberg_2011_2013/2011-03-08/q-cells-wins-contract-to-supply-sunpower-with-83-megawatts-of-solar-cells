Q-Cells SE’s North American unit
agreed on an 83-megawatt solar cell supply contract with  SunPower Corp. (SPWRA) , the second largest U.S. solar panel maker.  The cells will be used in San Jose, California-based
SunPower’s panels for commercial and utility scale projects, Q-
Cells  North America  said today in a statement. Financial details
of the contract weren’t disclosed.  Q-Cells, which manufactures most of its solar cells and
modules in Germany, is studying plans to open manufacturing
facilities in North America, its North America CEO Marc van Gerven said in an interview. “We are seeing a trend of in-
region module manufacturing becoming more widespread,” he said.  The U.S. market is expanding with “great market
indicators,” van Gerven said, adding that a stable policy in
the U.S. is important to the global market. “The key parameter
is predictability,” he said. “Q-Cells is focused on the long
term predictability of the industry rather than being driven by
spot market factors,” he said.  Q-Cells, based in Thalheim,  Germany , will begin selling its
thin-film copper indium gallium selenide, or CIGS, modules as a
stand-alone product in the U.S. in the second half of the year,
van Gerven said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
