  Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd. (SCBL) ,
the country’s third-biggest lender by market value, fell to its
lowest level in two months in Nairobi on concern that its
profitability is lagging behind that of rivals.  The stock declined 3.4 percent to 260 shillings at 3 p.m.
local time. It was the lowest close since Jan. 4 and biggest
slump for the stock since Dec. 15.  “With close to 75 percent of its loan book under wholesale
banking,” the  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  unit “continued to record
a below-industry net interest margin of 7.7 percent,” African
Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd. wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients. There will be “no immediate improvement in net
interest margin as spreads in wholesale banking remain low due
to competition,” the brokerage wrote.  The industry average for net interest margin is 10.3
percent, according to the note.  Standard Chartered Bank Kenya said yesterday net income
climbed 13 percent to 5.34 billion shillings ($65.1 million) in
the 12 months through December.  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) , the country’s
biggest lender, said last week full-year earnings surged 69
percent, while  Barclays Bank  of Kenya Ltd. said profit jumped 74
percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
