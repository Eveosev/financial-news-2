Croatian opposition leader Zoran Milanovic rejected Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor’s offer to
discuss early elections, saying it is “too late” to hold
talks.  State TV  reported late yesterday that Kosor called for a
March 10 meeting with opposition officials to discuss general
elections and accession to the European Union. Thousands of
people have protested over the last two weeks in the capital
city Zagreb and elsewhere demanding the government step down
over the economic crisis and early elections be held.  “If the prime minister wants to discuss elections, she
should come to Parliament, as we have been urging her to do for
the past week,” Zoran Milanovic, head of the Social Democrats,
told journalists today. He said that “so far, no invitation for
a meeting has been received.”  The opposition, which supports early elections, has said it
is not involved in organizing the protests. General elections
must be held by the end of the year.  Croatia is battling recession for two years. The government
expects the economy to expand 1.5 percent this year. The
Adriatic Sea nation is in the final stage of negotiations with
the European Union and hopes to join the bloc in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
