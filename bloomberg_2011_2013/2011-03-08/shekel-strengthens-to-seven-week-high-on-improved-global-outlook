The shekel gained to the highest in
almost seven weeks as lower  oil prices , spurred by speculation
Middle East turmoil may subside, increased confidence about the
global economic outlook and reduced demand for safer assets.  Oil retreated from the highest level since September 2008,
declining as much as 2 percent after al-Jazeera reported that
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  offered to relinquish power.
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries members are
holding informal discussions on raising output and haven’t yet
reached a decision, Kuwait’s oil minister said.  “There is a sense in the market that tensions in the
Middle East are calming down, reducing  Israel ’s risk premium,”
Amir Kahanovich, an economist at Clal Finance Investment
Management Ltd. in Tel Aviv said by telephone. “Investors are
now starting to focus on riskier assets.”  The shekel strengthened as much as 0.4 percent to 3.5793
per dollar, the highest intraday level since Jan. 20, and was as
of 3.5830 at 2:30 p.m. in  Tel Aviv .  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Mimshal Shiklit
government bond was unchanged at 5.22 percent, holding at the
highest since December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
