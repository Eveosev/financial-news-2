  Netherlands  withheld 3.2 million
euros ($4.47 million) of aid to  Uganda  after the country failed
to punish a government official implicated in corruption during
the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting,  New Vision  said.  The funds are part of an 8 million-euro package the
European nation had pledged to Uganda for its law and justice
professions, the Kampala-based newspaper reported, citing a Feb.
17 letter by the ambassador to Finance Ministry Permanent
Secretary Chris Kassami. Uganda hosted the meeting in November
2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
