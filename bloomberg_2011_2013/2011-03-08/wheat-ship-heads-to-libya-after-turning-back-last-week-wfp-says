A cargo ship carrying wheat to  Libya 
should arrive tomorrow after turning back last week because of
security concerns, said Caroline Hurford, a spokeswoman for the  World Food Programme .  The ship is expected to be in the Libyan port of Benghazi
to deliver 1,182 metric tons of the grain, Hurford said today
from  London . It had to go back to Malta on March 3 without
unloading its cargo.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
