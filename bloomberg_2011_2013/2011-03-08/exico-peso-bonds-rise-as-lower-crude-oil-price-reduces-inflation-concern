  Mexico ’s peso-denominated bonds
rose, pushing yields on benchmark securities down for a third
day, as lower  oil prices  quelled concern that inflation will
pick up and prompt the central bank to raise  interest rates .  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due 2024 fell 2
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.94 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price rose 0.18 centavo to
117.18 centavos per peso. The yield reached 7.995 percent on
March 3, the highest level in a year.  Crude oil fell from a 29-month high while emerging market
bonds advanced as members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries discussed holding a special meeting amid
concern that the Libyan turmoil will disrupt supply. Mexico’s
central bank kept its benchmark borrowing costs at 4.5 percent
on March 4, while saying conflicts in the Middle East, world
commodity prices and bad domestic weather may spur inflation.  “The strategy for a central bank like Mexico is to talk
tough while walking a very narrow line favoring growth over
austerity to keep the economy moving along,”  Michael Roche , an
emerging-market strategist at MF Global in  New York , said in a
telephone interview. “It’s difficult to arrest food and energy
shock by using the demand management tools of raising or
lowering interest rates.”  Mexico’s inflation probably slowed to 0.4 percent last
month, from 0.49 percent in January, according to the median
forecast of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The report is
scheduled for release tomorrow.  The peso was little changed at 12.0054 per dollar, from
12.0482 yesterday. It has gained 2.8 percent this year, the best
performer among six major Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
