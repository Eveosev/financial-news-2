Former Libyan Interior Minister
Abdul Fattah Younis said the Qaddafi regime has “only days
left,” the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  A 15,000-strong rebel force, which includes about 1,000
defected soldiers, is being assembled to march west to attempt
to take Sirte, Younis said, according to the FT. It is the key
city dividing the opposition-controlled east from the west, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
