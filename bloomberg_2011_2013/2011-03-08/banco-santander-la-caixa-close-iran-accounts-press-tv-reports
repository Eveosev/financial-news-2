La Caixa  and  Banco Santander  SA
closed the accounts of Iran’s embassy in Madrid to comply with
financial sanctions against the country over its nuclear
program,  Press TV  reported, without citing anyone.  Banco Santander earlier requested embassy officials
withdraw their funds within a month, the Iranian state-run news
channel said. The bank closed the account after the money was
pulled out, Press TV said.  Embassy officials subsequently opened an account with La
Caixa, which halted all banking transactions last week and shut
the account yesterday, the channel said late yesterday.  Officials from Iran’s Economic Affairs and  Finance Ministry 
and the country’s Chamber of Commerce arrived in Madrid
yesterday to meet with Spanish officials, Press TV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
