The hotel industry may take another
three years to return to its condition prior to the financial
crisis, according to David Michels, former chief executive
officer of Hilton Group Plc.  “I think it may take until 2013 or 2014” to get back to
the levels of 2006 and 2007, Michels said in an interview at the
International Hotel Investment Forum in Berlin today. “We have
already seen a recovery in the budget sector.”  The former Hilton executive is the founder of Michels &
Taylor, a British hotel asset management firm. Hilton Group Plc,
spun off from the U.S.-based Hilton hotels chain in 1964, was
bought back in a deal announced in 2005. Michels left the U.K.
division after the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
