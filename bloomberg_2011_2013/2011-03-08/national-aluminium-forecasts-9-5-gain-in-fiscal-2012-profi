National Aluminium Co.,  India ’s
second-biggest producer, forecast a 9.5 percent gain in profit
for the next fiscal year as prices of the lightweight metal used
to make aircraft and beverage cans increase.  Net income will probably rise to 11 billion rupees ($244
million) in the year to March 31, 2012 from an estimated 10.5
billion rupees in the year ending this month, the company said
today in a letter to shareholders. Sales may climb 12 percent to
64.95 billion rupees.  Aluminum last week advanced to the highest price since
September 2008 on the London Metal Exchange. The metal may climb
as high as $2,800 a metric ton as a shortfall drains Shanghai
Futures Exchange stockpiles,  Macquarie Bank  Ltd. said in a
report dated yesterday, implying an 8 percent gain from current
levels.  Chinese usage probably will run at an annual rate of more
than 17 million tons in the first half’s later months, against
an equivalent pace for local production of about 16.5 million
tons as of 2010’s third quarter, Macquarie Bank said.  National Aluminium’s profit may climb to 12.5 billion
rupees on sales of 69.4 billion rupees in the financial year
ending March 31, 2013, the company said. The forecasts are based
on price assumptions of $2,300 a ton for fiscal 2012 and $2,400
for fiscal 2013, the company said.  National Aluminium’s shares have advanced 15 percent this
year, the best performers on the Bombay Stock Exchange’s index
of 34 state-owned companies. The stock gained 0.6 percent to
close at 452.40 rupees in Mumbai today, the highest level in
almost 14 months. The company last week announced a stock split
and the issue of free shares to enhance liquidity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
