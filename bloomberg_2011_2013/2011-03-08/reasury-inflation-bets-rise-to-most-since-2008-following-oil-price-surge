Treasury traders increased bets
inflation will accelerate to the highest level since July 2008
as oil traded at almost a 29-month high.  The yield difference between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the securities, widened to
as much as 2.55 percentage points, the most in 32 months. The
extra yield investors demand to hold 30-year bonds over two-year
notes increased for a third day to 393 basis points. The
government is scheduled to sell $32 billion of three-year notes.  “Investors are increasingly nervous that higher  oil prices 
will push up headline inflation,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist in Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd., a broker for banks and investors. “The longer end is
being influenced by the perceptions on inflation and creeping
concerns that the Federal Reserve is getting a bit behind the
curve compared to other central banks.”  Benchmark 10-year yields were little changed at 3.52
percent at 7:46 a.m. in  New York , according to BGCantor Market
Data. The 3.625 percent note due in February 2021 traded at 100
29/32. The 30-year bond yield advanced less than one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.63 percent.  Ten-year yields will rise to 3.93 percent by year-end, a
Bloomberg survey of bank and security company estimates shows.  ‘Price Pressures’  Treasuries have handed investors a 0.4 percent loss this
year, after a 2.7 percent drop in the fourth quarter of 2010,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The  National Federation of Independent Business  monthly
optimism index climbed to a three-year high of 94.5 last month,
from 94.1 in January. The median forecast of 13 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an advance to 95.  The prices of oil products have surged amid unrest in  Libya . Gasoline advanced 11 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  last week. Crude for April delivery rose to $106.95 a
barrel yesterday in New York, the highest level since September
2008, as Libyan warplanes bombed rebel positions near the crude-
producing hub of Ras Lanuf. It slipped 0.7 percent today.  “We have to watch, and we are watching very carefully, how
much pass-through and how much pricing power there is and how
much can be passed through to the consumer and how damaging it
can be,”  Federal Reserve  Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said yesterday in  Washington .  Weak Spots  Employment, housing and municipal budgets are the weak
spots in the  U.S. economy , said Kei Katayama, leader of the
foreign fixed-income group in Tokyo at Daiwa SB Investments
Ltd., which has the equivalent of $55.3 billion in assets.
Yields could fall if the inflation threat from higher oil prices
recedes, he said.  The U.S. jobless rate decreased to 8.9 percent in February
from 9 percent in January, the Labor Department reported March
4. U.S. residential real-estate prices dropped by the most in a
year in the 12 months ended in December, based on the S&P/Case-
Shiller index of home values.  “The economy will slow down,” Katayama said. “If the
market focuses on the economic outlook, yields will go down.”
He said he bought  U.S. government debt  earlier this year.  The Fed is scheduled to buy $6 billion to $8 billion of
Treasuries maturing from September 2016 to February 2018 today
as part of its plan to sustain the expansion by pumping
$600 billion into the economy.  Three-Year Sale  The three-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 1.273
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 1.349 percent at
the previous offering of the securities on Feb. 8.  Investors bid for 3.01 times the amount of available debt
last month. The average for the past 10 auctions is 3.14.  Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks,
bought 27.6 percent in February, compared with the 10-sale
average of 38.9 percent. Direct bidders, non-primary dealers
buying for their own accounts, purchased 10.1 percent, the least
in a year. The 20 primary dealers are firms that are required to
underwrite the  U.S. debt .  The Treasury also plans to sell $21 billion of 10-year
notes tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds a day later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
