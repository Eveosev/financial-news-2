  LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB)  said it
may have flaring at its Channelview, Texas, chemical complex as
it restarts a process unit.  The report was made on a community hot line.  David Harpole ,
a Lyondell spokesman, said the company doesn’t comment on day-
to-day operations.  “We put the information on the hot line as a courtesy to
our neighbors,” Harpole said.  The Channelview plant has two olefins units, each with a
capacity of 1.95 billion pounds a year, according to the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
