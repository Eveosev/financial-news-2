Lithuanian Economy Minister Dainius Kreivys resigned today following allegations that he helped his
mother win public contracts.  Kreivys had a conflict of public and private interests, the
Chief Official Ethics Commission said today. President Dalia Grybauskaite had called for him to step down.  Kreivys signed off on European Union financial aid to
refurbish two public schools that later used his mother’s
companies as subcontractors. Kreivys denied any wrongdoing,
saying he only approved school repairs and municipalities picked
companies to carry out reconstruction.  “I’ve been swamped with an avalanche of lies,” Kreivys
said at a press conference in Vilnius today. “I’ve never
earmarked aid for companies associated with me.  He will appeal the Ethics Commission’s decision in court,
he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
