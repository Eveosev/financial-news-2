Turkish bonds fell, sending
benchmark two-year yields to their highest level in more than
nine months, after the Treasury sold debt at the highest costs
this year.  The yield on two-year bonds rose 7 basis points to 9.11
percent at the 5 p.m. close in Istanbul, the highest level since
May 25, the RBS Istanbul benchmark bond index showed.  The Treasury raised 3.3 billion liras ($2.1 billion) in a
sale of bonds due 2012 at a yield of 9.01 percent, according to
the department’s Bloomberg page. The offering of the debt on
Feb. 1 was priced to yield 8.1 percent, up from 6.98 percent
from the first auction of the notes on Jan. 10. The Treasury
also sold 627.5 million liras of January 2014 bonds at 9.47
percent average yield today, up from 9.14 percent in its first
sale, in January.  “The demand for the bonds was weak and this was an
important cause for the bond yields’ rise today,” Alper Gokpinar, a bond analyst at Is Asset Management in Istanbul,
said by phone.  Two-year bond yields have jumped 33 basis points this month
on concern higher  oil prices  may stoke inflation and prompt the
central bank to increase  interest rates . The central bank said
March 4 it expects  core inflation  to accelerate from 3.8 percent
in February.  The lira climbed 0.4 percent to 1.5907 per dollar, its
strongest intraday level since Feb. 23, as of 6 p.m. in
Istanbul.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  of stocks rose 1.8 percent to
61,301.65, the highest level since Feb 25.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
