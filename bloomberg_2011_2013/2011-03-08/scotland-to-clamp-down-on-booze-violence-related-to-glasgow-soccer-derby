  Scotland  plans to crack down on
alcohol consumption and violence related to the “Old Firm”
soccer derby in Glasgow.  The scheduling of games between Celtic and Rangers will
also be reviewed, according to a joint statement from the two
clubs, the Scottish Football Association, the police and the
Scottish Government. Expanding banning orders for abusive fans
will be looked at, especially when criminal activity is related
to domestic violence, they said.  Strathclyde Police  requested a “summit” after a game
between the two rival Glasgow clubs last week saw the referee
expel three players with red cards during the match in addition
to clashes between fans outside the ground. As well as
representing different parts of Glasgow, the teams also are
traditionally divided between Catholics and Protestants.  “There is no place in football for passion turning into
violence or pride into bigotry,” First Minister  Alex Salmond 
said at a press conference in Edinburgh today.  There were also several confrontations between coaching
staff and 34 arrests inside the Celtic Park stadium. Salmond
said today that police will give pre-match briefings to players.  To contact the reporter on this story:
