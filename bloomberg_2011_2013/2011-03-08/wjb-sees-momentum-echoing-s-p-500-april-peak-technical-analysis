The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
drop as much as 8.8 percent from its February high as the
market’s momentum slows and fewer stocks are left to support any
further advance, according to WJB Capital Group Inc.  The firm’s Bellwether index, which tracks  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) , Morgan Stanley, Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.
and copper futures to gauge the market’s direction, started to
show signs similar to those that proceeded the bull market’s
biggest retreat, which lasted from April to July, according to
John Roque, head of  technical analysis  at WJB Capital.  “The S&P 500 is running out of stream,” Roque, a managing
director at WJB, wrote in a note yesterday. “It’s unlikely that
the market will accelerate higher.”  The proportion of stocks trading above their 200-day
average on the  New York  Stock Exchange has been at least 80
percent on a weekly basis since Jan. 28, the longest stretch in
more than a year, Bloomberg data show. The market’s “waning”
momentum, combined with an “overbought” condition, suggests
the  S&P 500  may slide to as low as 1,225, Roque said.  The S&P 500 has fallen 2.5 percent from its 32-month high
on Feb. 18 amid concern surging energy prices will hurt U.S.
consumer spending, the largest part of the world’s biggest
economy, and corporate profits. Analysts including Raymond James
Financial Inc.’s Art Huprich said last week that further losses
may be in store should the S&P 500 fall below the intraday low
of 1,294.26 of Feb. 24. The benchmark closed at 1,310.13
yesterday.  The WJB Capital Group Bellwether index’s Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence line, calculated by subtracting the
index’s average level during the past 26 days from the average
over the past 12 days, is poised to turn negative for the first
time since April. Roque said that negative reading on the
index’s MACD was followed by a 12 percent decline in the S&P
500.  Compared with the broad market, smaller companies were more
“overbought,” Roque said. As of the close on March 4, 92
percent of the stocks in the S&P Midcap 400 Index traded above
their 200-day moving average, he said.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Lu Wang  in New York at   lwang8@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
