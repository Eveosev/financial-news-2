Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker preparing for an initial public offering this year,
estimated its value at about $4.77 billion at the end of last
year for payments it made to executives.  Executives were awarded Chrysler Group units, each equal to
1/600th of a membership interest, valued at about $7.95 as of
Dec. 31, up from $1.66 in an earlier calculation, according to a
Feb. 25 securities filing. That values the Class A and Class B
membership units at about $4,770 each and the whole company at
$4.77 billion because Chrysler’s ownership consists of 1 million
membership interests.  “The valuation was determined for the purpose of providing
a fair value to equity-based compensation for executive
officers,” Eileen Wunderlich, a Chrysler spokeswoman, said in
an interview yesterday.  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  has said he wants
to take Chrysler public during the second half of this year and
that he expects to meet performance requirements this year to
raise  Fiat SpA (F) ’s stake in the automaker to 35 percent.  Citigroup Inc. analysts led by John Lawson in November 2009
placed Chrysler’s equity value at the time at about $8 billion.
Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, in a November 2009 report
estimated Chrysler’s equity value at about $6 billion.  Chrysler reported a net loss last year of $652 million on
$41.9 billion in revenue. The company has said it will make as
much as $500 million in net profit this year, its first since
emerging from bankruptcy in June 2009.  UAW Stake  At a $4.77 billion valuation for the company, the United
Auto Workers retiree health care trust’s 64 percent stake in
Chrysler would be valued at about $3.05 billion. The U.S.
government’s 9.2 percent stake in the  Auburn Hills , Michigan-
based automaker is worth $438.8 million.  The U.S. government gave Chrysler $12.5 billion in
assistance to keep it going in 2009, according to the Office of
the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief
Program.  The face value of debts to the U.S. and Canadian government
are worth $7.53 billion, according to Chrysler’s Feb. 25 U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
