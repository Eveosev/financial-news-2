  SACI Falabella (FALAB)  rose and was Chile’s
second most traded stock after reporting a bigger-than-forecast
increase in fourth-quarter profit as Latin American consumption
growth pushed up sales.  Falabella climbed 1.1 percent to 4,445 pesos at 1:11 p.m.
New York time and gained as much as 1.7 percent. Trading in the
stock totaled 6.22 billion pesos, according to Bloomberg data.  Net income was 169 billion pesos ($361 million), a 48
percent increase on a year ago on higher sales, improved
operating results and a one-time asset sale gain, the Santiago-
based company wrote in an e-mailed statement after the close of
trading yesterday. The average estimate of six analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News was 117 billion pesos.  “The company has been able to capitalize on higher  consumer confidence  in the region and continues to post
improvements in margins,” Salvador Arenas, head of equity
research at Larrain Vial SA, wrote today in a note to clients.  Full-year profit rose 69 percent to 413 billion pesos.
Falabella opened 16 stores in the fourth quarter: five in Chile,
seven in Peru, two in  Argentina  and two in Colombia, it said.  Falabella agreed in September to sell its stake in
Farmacias Ahumada SA for about $100 million to  Mexico ’s Grupo
Casa Saba SAB de CV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
