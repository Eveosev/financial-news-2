  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said Chief Executive Officer Robert Henrikson’s
compensation rose 20 percent last year as he expanded in Asia
and Europe with the purchase of a business from American

$11.6 million in 2009, the New York-based insurer said today in
a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
