Asurion Corp., the private equity-
owned provider of wireless handset insurance and roadside
assistance, is seeking $4.64 billion of loans to refinance debt,
according to three people briefed on the transaction.  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group
AG, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank
AG will host a lender meeting March 10 at 10:30 a.m. in  New
York , said the people, who declined to be identified because the
terms are private.  Asurion will raise a $3.5 billion first-lien term loan due
in seven years, $1.02 billion of second-lien debt maturing in
eight year and a $120 million revolving  credit line  expiring in
five years, the people said.  The company, acquired in 2007 in a $4.1 billion leveraged
buyout, raised a $900 million term loan in October to pay a
dividend to owners Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, Providence
Equity Partners Inc., Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and
Berkshire Partners LLC, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mark Gunning, chief financial officer of Nashville,
Tennessee-based Asurion, didn’t immediately return a telephone
message left at his office seeking comment.  Asurion’s $900 million loan pays an interest rate 5.25
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate
with a 1.5 percent floor on the lending benchmark, Bloomberg
data show. The company issued the debt at 95 cents on the
dollar.  Lenders also have a soft-call protection of 102 cents
during the first year, according to Bloomberg data, meaning the
company would have to pay a 2 cent premium over face value to
refinance the debt during that time. The premium over par drops
to 1 cent for the second year.  Buyout Debt  The company raised a $1.76 billion  term loan , a $100
million revolver and $580 million of payment-in-kind debt in
2007 to help finance its LBO, Bloomberg data show.  When the financing was completed, the term loan due July
2014 had a spread of 3 percentage points more than Libor, the
revolver expiring January 2013 paid a margin of 2 percentage
points over the benchmark and the PIK-loan’s premium over the
lending rate was set at 6.5 percentage points, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
