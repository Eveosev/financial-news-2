Spot ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel in
Chicago strengthened after  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  shut its refinery
last month in Canton, Ohio, for planned maintenance.  Marathon started work at the 84,500-barrel-a-day plant,
Shane Pochard, a company spokesman, said on Feb. 28. ULSD at the
hub today reached its highest level since Nov. 12.  The premium for ULSD in Chicago versus heating oil futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  increased 1.5 cents
to 3.25 cents a gallon at 2:36 p.m., according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The fuel was at a 3 cent discount to futures March
1. Prompt delivery fell 3.8 cents to $3.0452 a gallon.  Marathon will perform a full plant turnaround at the Canton
refinery starting this month through April, according to the
Canton City Health Department’s Air Pollution Control Division.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Chicago  narrowed 2 cents to 22.5 cents a gallon. Prompt delivery
slipped 3.72 cents to $2.7217 a gallon.    Sunoco Inc. (SUN) ’s Philadelphia refinery was struck by a fire
early today, according to Carl Grynes, a chief with the city’s
fire department.  The blaze occurred in the insulation of a feeding unit and
was handled by Sunoco workers, he said. The fire was reported at
1:59 a.m. local time and was under control by 2:16 a.m.,
according to the fire chief. The company contained a separate
fire at the plant in a vacuum tower and isolated the unit
yesterday.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
