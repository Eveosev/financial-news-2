Qatar, the world’s largest liquefied
natural gas exporter, said LNG sales to the U.S. are being
limited by shale gas discoveries in the country.  More LNG supplies are being diverted to the Asia-Pacific
region instead, Qatari Energy Minister Mohammed Saleh Al Sada
said in Doha today.  The minister said 60 percent of Qatari LNG “moved to the
east” in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Robert Tuttle  in Doha at
