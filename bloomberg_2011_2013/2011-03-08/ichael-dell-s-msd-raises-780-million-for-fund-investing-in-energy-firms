MSD Capital LP, the money-management
firm that oversees  Michael Dell ’s fortune, raised almost $780
million for a hedge fund that will invest in energy companies,
according to a regulatory filing.  MSD Energy Partners LP, based in  New York , received the
backing from 25 investors, according to a Form D filed today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund will
be run by Brian Frank, a former employee at Cumberland
Associates, a New York-based hedge fund that invests in oil and
gas stocks.  Dell, founder and chairman of Dell Inc., the Round Rock,
Texas, company that ranks as the world’s third-largest personal-
computer maker, formed MSD Capital in 1998 to manage his
family’s investments. The firm, which has more than $12 billion
in assets under management, makes private-equity and real estate
investments as well as taking stakes in publicly traded
companies.  MSD took in capital from outside investors for the first
time last year, when the firm sought backing for a fund that
invests in distressed and undervalued European securities. MSD
European Opportunity Fund LP and its offshore affiliate have
raised about $506 million, according to separate filings with
the SEC in January and February.  MSD Capital began acquiring shares of  Blueknight Energy
Partners LP (BKEP)  during the third quarter of 2008 and now holds a
16.5 percent stake in the Tulsa,  Oklahoma , provider of crude oil
gathering, transportation and storage services, according to
regulatory filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
