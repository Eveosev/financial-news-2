  Estonia ’s ruling Reform Party, which
won elections two days ago, may invite the opposition Social
Democrats to join in talks with ally Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit
on forming a new government.  Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip ’s party will hold preliminary
discussions later today with Isamaa and the Social Democrats
before deciding on the direction it will take in coalition
talks, the Tallinn-based party said in an e-mailed statement.  Reform and Isamaa won 56 seats in the 101-member Riigikogu
on March 6, six seats more than in 2007 elections, after
pledging to continue spending controls that helped the country
adopt the euro this year. Ansip and Isamaa’s chairman, former
Prime Minister Mart Laar, said then that the present coalition
is likely to continue due to similar political platforms.  The Social Democrats were part of a coalition after the
2007 vote along with the other two parties before Ansip ousted
them from the government in May 2009 over budget measures,
including  unemployment benefits .  The Social Democrats won 19 seats in the March 6 elections,
up from nine in 2007, the biggest increase among the four
parties to gain entrance to parliament. The party, lead by
former Defense Minister Sven Mikser, has pledged to abandon
Estonia’s 21 percent flat income tax, increase levies on the
rich, cut the value-added  tax rate  on essential goods and boost
social spending.  “The program of the new government must support Reform’s
long-term vision of Estonia becoming a free and wealthy Nordic
country,” Kristen Michal, Reform’s secretary general, said in
the statement. “We will certainly not agree to higher taxes, a
car tax or a progressive income tax.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
