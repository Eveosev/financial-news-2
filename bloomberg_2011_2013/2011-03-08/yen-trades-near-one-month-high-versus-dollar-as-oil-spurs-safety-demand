The euro approached a nine-month
high against the yen before data forecast to show a rebound in
German factory orders, backing the case for the  European Central
Bank  to raise  interest rates  before the Federal Reserve.    Europe ’s single currency climbed for a second day against
the Swiss franc on prospects an ECB official will today
reiterate willingness to increase borrowing costs as early as
next month. South Korea’s won rose toward the strongest in two
weeks as crude oil’s retreat from a 29-month high eased concern
the nation’s trade surplus will narrow. New Zealand’s dollar
rose for the first time in three days versus the yen as a
technical indicator showed its recent declines were excessive.  “If you are looking at the big economies in Europe, things
are certainly improving, and leading the way is Germany,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist in Sydney at Commonwealth
Bank of  Australia , the nation’s largest lender. “With the ECB
being so hawkish and the  Federal Reserve  being so dovish, we
expect the euro to keep tracking higher.”  The euro rose to 115.10 yen at 7:05 a.m. in  London  from
114.87 yen in  New York  yesterday, after reaching 116.00 on March
4, the strongest since May 14. The common currency was at
$1.3975 from $1.3968 yesterday, when it touched $1.4036, the
most since Nov. 8. The euro gained to 1.3020 francs from 1.2943
francs. The yen bought 82.36 per dollar from 82.24.  The MSCI Asia Pacific index advanced 0.1 percent after
falling as much as 0.3 percent today. Crude oil for April
delivery retreated 1.3 percent.  ECB Outlook  The euro has risen 1.5 percent in the past week while the
yen has weakened 0.7 percent according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes, which track the currencies of 10
developed nations.  Factory orders in  Germany , adjusted for seasonal swings and
inflation, climbed 2.5 percent from December, when they slid 3.4
percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin will probably say today
according to economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said yesterday that the
world’s central bankers are united in their aim to prevent
surging  oil prices  from fanning broader inflation. He said on
March 3 that an “increase of interest rates in the next meeting
is possible.”  ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny is scheduled to
speak in Vienna today. Current low rates will “normalize” once
an economic recovery gains hold, he said last month.  Korean Won  The won reversed losses from yesterday when it slid the
most in a week as clashes stemming from an uprising in Libya led
to crude reaching $106.95 a barrel, the highest since September
2008.  South Korea  is Asia’s fourth-largest oil importer.  “The oil issue needs to be taken into consideration for
the market, and if it gets worse, it will definitely affect oil
importers and the won,” said Ko Yun Jin, a currency trader at
Kookmin Bank in Seoul. “The Kospi was lower earlier but has
since improved and this is helping the won.”  The won rose 0.1 percent to 1,117.82 per dollar, after
slipping 0.4 percent yesterday. It reached 1,114.10 on March 4,
the strongest level since Feb. 21. The Kospi increased 0.8
percent after losing as much as 0.3 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar rebounded from the weakest level since
September against the yen. The so-called kiwi’s 14-day relative
strength index versus the yen fell to 29.4 yesterday, below the
30 threshold that some traders see as a sign an asset’s price
has fallen too fast and is poised to rise.  “It seems traders are adjusting their positions after
seeing a rapid drop in the kiwi,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, a
senior currency analyst in Tokyo at Ueda Harlow Ltd., which
provides foreign-exchange margin-trading services.  The  New Zealand  currency advanced to 61.04 yen from 60.60
yen yesterday, when it touched 60.35 yen, the weakest level
since Sept. 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
