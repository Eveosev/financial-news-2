  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  was appointed
by Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd. to advise on a 65 billion-
shilling ($784 million) upgrade to the Changamwe oil refinery,
Business Daily reported, citing the Energy Ministry.    Standard Chartered  will raise 75 percent of the debt needed
to fund the revamp, while the rest would be provided by
shareholders, the Nairobi-based newspaper said. The upgrade will
enable the facility to process all types of crude, including the
waxy type produced in neighboring Uganda, it said.  KPRL currently processes 1.6 million metric tons of crude
oil annually, meeting 40 percent of the countryâ€™s fuel needs,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
