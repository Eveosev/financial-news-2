The boys’ basketball team at
 Fennville High School  in southwest  Michigan  won its first game
in the state tournament last night, four days after star guard
Wes Leonard died on the court of a heart ailment.  Fennville improved to 21-0 by winning its district opener
65-54 over Lawrence High. Last night’s game was moved to Hope
College in Holland, Michigan, to accommodate the sellout crowd
of about 3,500 that paid tribute to Leonard.  Leonard collapsed and died minutes after hitting the game-
winning basket in overtime to cap Fennville’s unbeaten regular
season. The medical examiner determined Leonard, who was also
quarterback of the school’s football team, suffered cardiac
arrest because of an enlarged heart. He was 16.  “I’m proud of the way we handled things, I’m proud of the
way Lawrence handled things,” Fennville coach Ryan Klingler
said at a televised news conference. “The effort by both teams
was the way it should be and I think Wes would be proud of us
all, I know that.”  Fennville school officials decided to play yesterday’s game
after talking with Leonard’s family.  Leonard’s younger brother, Mitchell, joined the Fennville
players as they walked onto the court for pregame warmups
wearing black T-shirts that had Wes Leonard’s name and number on
the back and the phrase “Never Forgotten” on the front.  A moment of silence was held before tipoff for Leonard,
whose funeral will be held today in Holland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
