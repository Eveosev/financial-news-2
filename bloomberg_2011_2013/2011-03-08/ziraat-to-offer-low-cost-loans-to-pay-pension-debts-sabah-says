TC Ziraat Bankasi AS, the state-run
Turkish bank, will offer low cost loans to people who wish to
pay off their debts to the state pension system, Sabah newspaper
reported.  The offer applies to people who have unpaid premiums to the
Bag-Kur pension provider, the Istanbul-based newspaper said. The
government is waiving about a third of the accumulated fines and
payments, and Ziraat is offering low-cost financing, it said,
citing Emin Zararsiz, head of the pensions authority.  The offer could allow up to 312,000 people to qualify for
pensions payments, Sabah said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
