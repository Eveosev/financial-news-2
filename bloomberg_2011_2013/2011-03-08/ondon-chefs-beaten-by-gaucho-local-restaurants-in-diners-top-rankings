Half a million diners who have
booked via  Toptable.com  have given their verdict on U.K.
restaurants and the Top 100 is led by venues in  Scotland .  London stalwarts such as Le Gavroche and Chez Bruce are
beaten by Martin Wishart, a Michelin-starred establishment in
Edinburgh, and by Piccolo Mondo, an Italian venue in Glasgow.
Only five of the Top 10 for 2011 are situated in London.  The rankings are based on scores given by diners who have
booked their meals through Toptable, which is owned and operated
by  OpenTable Inc. (OPEN)  of  San Francisco . The results may surprise
food lovers unused to seeing local places and chain operators
such as  Gaucho  (32) beating gourmet destinations such as Galvin
La Chapelle (48), The Square (77) and Hibiscus (80).  “There are so many very good restaurants in the list that
it is deeply satisfying to be amongst them and to be
consistently highly rated by my customers,” Wishart said today
in an e-mailed press release from London-based Toptable.  The list includes only restaurants that may be booked via
Toptable, which invites diners to give them marks out of 10 for
food, service, value-for-money, ambience, whether they would
recommend an establishment and for the washrooms.  Here’s the Top 100 as scored by Toptable customers:  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
