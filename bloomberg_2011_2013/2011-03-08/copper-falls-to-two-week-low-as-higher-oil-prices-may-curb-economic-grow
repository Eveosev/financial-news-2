Copper rebounded from the lowest
price in almost two weeks as economic concerns eased following a
drop in energy costs.  Crude oil fell from a 29-month high in  New York  on
speculation that members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will meet to discuss ways to make up for the
loss of production out of  Libya . U.S. equities advanced. Copper
prices jumped to a record last month as mining companies
struggled to keep pace with rising consumption.  “Middle East concerns and oil prices remain at the
forefront,” said Alex Heath, the head of industrial-metals
trading at Royal Bank of Canada Europe Ltd. in London. “The
market will remain volatile.”  Copper futures for May delivery rose 1.15 cents, or 0.3
percent, to close at $4.3385 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the Comex
in New York, halting a four-session slump. Earlier, the price
touched $4.254, the lowest since Feb. 24.  Oil fell as much as 2 percent to $103.33 a barrel today.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months gained $31, or 0.3 percent, to $9,530 a metric ton ($4.32
a pound).  Aluminum, lead and zinc rose also climbed in London. Nickel
and tin fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
