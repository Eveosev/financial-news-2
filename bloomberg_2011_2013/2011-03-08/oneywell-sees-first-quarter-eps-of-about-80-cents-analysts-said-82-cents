  Honeywell International Inc. (HON) , a
maker of products ranging from home thermostats to aircraft
instruments, said it expects first-quarter earnings of about 80
cents a share.  Analysts had projected first-quarter profit of 82 cents, the
average of 17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales will be
about $8.7 billion, Honeywell said today in a statement. The
company reaffirmed its full-year forecast for earnings of $3.60
to $3.80 a share, excluding any adjustment for pension expenses.  The forecast, issued on the eve of tomorrowâ€™s investor
day, was toward the high end of a range of 76 cents to 80 cents
that Honeywell gave on a Jan. 28 earnings call. At the time,
analysts had projected profit of 85 cents a share.  Honeywell, based in  Morris Township , New Jersey, closed at
$57.30 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
