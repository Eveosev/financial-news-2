U.S. nuclear-power output rose for
the first time in six days, gaining 0.7 percent, as  Pinnacle
West Capital Corp. (PNW)  and  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  increased production at
plants in Arizona and Illinois, the  Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  said.  Output nationwide increased by 651 megawatts to 87,913
megawatts, or 87 percent of capacity, according to a  report 
today from the NRC and data compiled by Bloomberg. Fourteen of
the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Pinnacle increased output at its 1,335-megawatt Palo Verde
3 reactor to full power from 69 percent of capacity yesterday.
The unit was at 100 percent of capacity on March 4.  Two other reactors at the site, Units 1 and 2, which have
the same capacities as Unit 3, were also operating at full
power. The plant is about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of
Phoenix.  Exelon boosted its 1,120-megawatt LaSalle 2 reactor in  Illinois  to 22 percent of capacity from 1 percent. The unit
ended a refueling session that began on Feb. 14, Krista Lopykinski, a plant spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement
late yesterday.  Workers replaced about one-third of the reactor’s fuel and
performed more than 13,500 inspections and maintenance on plant
components that cannot be done while the unit is operating,
Lopykinski said.  The LaSalle station is 70 miles southwest of  Chicago .
Another unit at the plant, the 1,118-megawatt LaSalle 1 reactor,
was operating at full capacity.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
