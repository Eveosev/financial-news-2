Australian business confidence rose
to the highest level in almost a year as profitability improved
and optimism grew about rebuilding efforts in flood-damaged
Queensland state, a private survey showed.  The confidence index advanced to 14 in February, the
highest since March 2010, from 4 a month earlier, according to a  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  survey of more than 540 companies
from Feb. 21-25, and released in Sydney today. The business
conditions gauge, a measure of hiring, sales and profits, gained
to minus 2 from minus 6 a month earlier, the report showed.  The survey results reflect  Australia ’s “multi-speed
economy,” NAB said in an e-mailed statement. Surging exports of  iron ore  and coal are stoking a jobs boom in regions such as
Western Australia, while retailers and manufacturers in other
states are suffering from the effects of seven interest-rate
increases since October 2009 and a rising currency.  “Businesses are facing tough conditions, but are
optimistic about the near-term outlook, suggesting that current
difficulties may only be temporary,” NAB Chief Economist  Alan Oster  said in a statement. “The sense of relief was strongest
in Queensland as the business community looked forward to
reconstruction.”  Torrential rains in Queensland state in December and
January affected about 30,000 properties, shut coal mines, cut
rail lines and damaged crops. “Queensland was the most
optimistic, with businesses believing that the outlook for
Queensland could only get better,” Oster said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
