Commodity derivative markets are
opaque and may require tougher rules to curb excessive price
volatility according to draft plans set to be approved by
European Union governments this week.  Financial-market regulation “where appropriate” may be
needed to tackle “excessive price volatility” and the “risk
of interruptions or reductions of supplies,” according to a
draft statement published on the EU’s  website .  “The integrity and transparency of commodity derivatives
markets need to be improved,” according to the draft report
scheduled to be approved by EU ministers on March 10.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  has blamed speculation for
driving up world food prices and made regulation of commodity
trading one of his priorities during  France ’s leadership of the
Group of 20 countries in 2011.  Michel Barnier , the EU’s
financial services chief, and a former minister of Sarkozy’s,
called last month for restrictions on traders including position
limits.  “We are working in our capacity as the G-20 presidency to
very closely co-ordinate this work with that of the European
Union,” Gael Veyssiere, spokesman for the French government’s
EU office in Brussels, said in a telephone interview.  National officials pre-approved on March 2 the wording of
the statement on commodities during discussions in Brussels, the
EU document said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
