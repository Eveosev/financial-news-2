Lebanon’s trade deficit widened an
annual 54 percent in January on higher energy imports, the
finance ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  The deficit increased to $1.43 billion in January from $932
million in the same month a year earlier, the Beirut-based
ministry said. Imports increased 39 percent to $1.73 billion,
driven by “a substantially larger bill of mineral fuels and
oils” which more than doubled to $538 million, it said.  Exports decreased 5 percent from a year earlier to $297
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
