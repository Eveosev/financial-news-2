Gold fell from a record as declining
energy prices and a rebound by the dollar eroded the appeal of
the precious metal as an alternative asset and inflation hedge.  Crude oil dropped as much as 2 percent on speculation that
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
will hold an emergency meeting to discuss ways to make up for
lost output from  Libya , where rebels are fighting government
forces. The dollar rose against a basket of six major
currencies, and equities rallied.  “The gold market has been thrown a monkey wrench,” said  Matthew Zeman , a market strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago . “You’ve got people wading back into risk with oil down
and a stronger dollar and higher equities.”  Gold futures for April delivery fell $7.30, or 0.5 percent,
to settle at $1,427.20 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Yesterday, the metal advanced to a record of $1,445.70.
The price is up 27 percent in the past year.  Losses may be limited as unrest spreads in the Middle East
and northern  Africa , Zeman said.  “The geopolitical backdrop is going to support buying on
the dips,” he said.  A sluggish economy may boost demand for gold as a store of
value, said Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd.
in Chicago.  ‘Inflation Game’  “The rate of economic recovery isn’t enough to derail the
pro-commodity trade,” Pawlicki said in a report. “Consumers
are falling behind in the inflation game and may have difficulty
coping.”  Silver futures for May delivery fell 20.7 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $35.658 an ounce. Yesterday, the price reached
$36.745, the highest for a most-active contract since March
1980. That year, the metal climbed to a record of $50.35. Silver
has doubled in the past year.  Palladium futures for June delivery dropped $3.40, or 0.4
percent, to $786.70 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange.  Platinum futures for April delivery declined $17.80, or 1
percent, to $1,802.60 an ounce.  Palladium has gained 67 percent in the past 12 months and
platinum has gained 13 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
