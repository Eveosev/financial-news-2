Commercial Aircraft Corp. of  China 
expects 50 to 100 orders this year for the C919, the nation’s
first passenger jet, as it challenges  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS
in the world’s fastest-growing air-travel market.  The new plane will be as much as 15 percent more fuel-
efficient than existing narrowbody aircraft, Chen Jin, general
manager for sales and marketing, said today at the Hong Kong air
show. The maiden flight will take place in 2014, followed by the
start of commercial services two years later, he reiterated.  The state-controlled planemaker last year announced its
first orders for as many as 100 C919s, a competitor to the best-
selling models from Boeing and Airbus. The Shanghai-based
company aims to sell 3,000 aircraft worldwide during the next 20
years, about 10 percent of total global demand, Chen said today.  The company’s first customers for the C919 included  General
Electric Co. (GE) ’s leasing arm, Chinese lessors and the nation’s big
three carriers --  Air China Ltd. (601111) , China Southern Airlines Co.
and China Eastern Airlines Corp. The planemaker didn’t say how
many aircraft each customer had ordered.  GE Capital Aviation Services Ltd., the world’s largest
plane lessor, separately said it signed a letter of intent for
five planes with options for five more. Air China Chairman Kong Dong last week said the carrier had 20 C919s on order.  GE’s venture with  Safran SA (SAF) ,  CFM International , will supply
engines for the C919 as the company works to boost sales in the
world’s second-largest economy. Honeywell International Inc.,  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Hamilton Sundstrand Corp. unit and
Parker Hannifin Corp. are also among overseas suppliers working
on the plane.  China’s international passenger numbers will rise 11
percent a year from 2009 to 2014, and domestic demand will jump
14 percent annually in the period, according to the
 International Air Transport Association . Both figures are more
than double the global growth rate forecast by the airline group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
