  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) ,  Canada ’s
largest wireless carrier, plans to sell as much as $1.8 billion
($1.85 billion) of senior unsecured debt in a two-part offering,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The Toronto-based company may sell at least C$1.25 billion
of 10-year notes and at least C$250 million of 30-year bonds,
said the person, who declined to be identified because terms
aren’t set.   The 10-year notes may pay a spread of about 185 basis
points and the 30-year bonds may pay about 270 basis points more
than benchmarks, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
