Danske Bank A/S raised its six-month
forecast for the euro from $1.42 to $1.50, citing the outlook
for European Central Bank  interest rates  and improved appetite
for riskier assets on optimism about the global recovery.  The biggest Danish bank expects the ECB to raise the key
rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, in April and
deliver a total of four increases by January, Kasper Kirkegaard,
a senior analyst in Copenhagen, wrote in an e-mailed note
yesterday. The  Federal Reserve  will not tighten monetary policy
until mid-2012, he said.  “We are now in a situation in which relative monetary
policy is expected to deliver more support to the euro than
previously expected and where relative interest rates are likely
to peak earlier,” wrote Kirkegaard. “The appreciation pressure
on the euro should be strongest over the coming quarters and
then potentially fade toward year-end.”  Euro gains may be limited if the Fed signals a willingness
to increase rates, the European debt crisis escalates or oil
price gains begin to dent the global recovery, he said.  The bank also lowered its 12-month forecast to $1.42, from
$1.45 previously, to reflect “fading support going into 2012.”  The euro weakened 0.2 percent to $1.3943 as of 8:19 a.m. in  London . It has gained 4.2 percent versus the U.S. currency this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
