The Croatian  central bank  cut
commercial banks’ asset-to-liability ratio to 17 percent from 20
percent, freeing up 6.3 billion kuna ($1.18 billion) to ease
credit for economic development and help push  Croatia  out of
recession.  “The decision aims to facilitate investments in new
projects, which in turn would boost exports, create jobs and
improve the current account,” the central bank said.  Croatia has been battling a recession for two years. The
government expects the economy to expand 1.5 percent this year.
The Adriatic Sea nation is in the final stage of negotiations
with the European Union and hopes to join the bloc in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
