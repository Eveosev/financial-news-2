Lithuanian Prime Minister  Andrius Kubilius  said he backs the nomination of Vitas Vasiliauskas to
become the country’s next central bank governor.  “I’m of a rather positive opinion about him even though I
haven’t had a chance to discuss banking or monetary issues with
him,” Kubilius said in a radio interview with  Lietuvos Radijas 
today. “This is a wise man with experience, and I think he can
handle the job and the responsibility.”  President Dalia Grybauskaite named Vasiliauskas, a former
deputy finance minister, as the Baltic country’s next central
bank governor yesterday. The 37-year-old lawyer would replace
Reinoldijus Sarkinas, whose mandate expired on Feb. 15. The
appointment still requires Parliament’s approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
