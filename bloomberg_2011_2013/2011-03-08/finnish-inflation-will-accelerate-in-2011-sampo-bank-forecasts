Finland’s inflation will accelerate
this year at the fastest pace since 2008, Sampo Bank forecast.  The inflation rate, which includes house prices and
borrowing costs, will rise to 3.2 percent in 2011 from 1.2
percent last year, before easing to 2.4 percent in 2012,
Helsinki-based Sampo Bank, a unit of Danske Bank A/S, forecast
today. The rate averaged 4.1 percent in 2008.  The northernmost euro member’s economy will expand 3.2
percent in 2011 after growing 3.1 percent last year, the bank
said. It had previously estimated 2.8 percent growth for this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
