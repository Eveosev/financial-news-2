California saw higher growth in its
inland cities and counties than on the coast and found double-
digit increases in its Asian and Hispanic populations over the
past decade, according to 2010 Census data released today.  In Los Angeles, the state’s largest city, the population
climbed 2.6 percent to 3.8 million since 2000. In  San Diego , the
population rose 6.9 percent to 1.3 million.  San Jose  saw an
increase of 5.7 percent to 945,942 and  San Francisco ’s
population rose 3.7 percent to 805,235, during the same period,
census data showed.  Fresno, the state’s fifth-largest city, had a population
increase of 15.7 percent to 494,665 since 2000. The largest city
in California’s Central Valley, it is located approximately 155
miles (250 kilometers) inland from Monterey.  Coastal areas tended to be “hostile to business” and
development, while jobs and cheaper housing drove people inland,
according to Joel Kotkin, author of, “The Next Hundred Million:
America in 2050,” a book published last year about the nation’s
demographic changes.  “High energy prices and subprime mortgages were supposed
to be the death of suburbia,” Kotkin said in a telephone
interview. “That didn’t happen.”  Growth Slowed    California ’s rate of growth slowed with the total
population increasing 10 percent between 2000 and 2010 to
37,253,956, the data show. That was the lowest rate since census
numbers were compiled for the state. In the 2000 census,
California saw a 13.8 percent increase and in 1990, it grew by
25.7 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  “California is becoming an anchor more than a magnet, sort
of like  New York . It’s a center of power and wealth, but a place
middle class folks have been moving out of to more affordable
parts of the country,” said  William Frey , a demographer with
the  Brookings Institution  in  Washington .  “California’s population will continue to grow although
not nearly at the rate we’ve seen in the past. The idea that
‘We’ll just shuck everything and move to California,’ those days
are gone, even among some of the immigrant populations,” Frey
said.  Neighboring  Nevada ’s population increased 35.1 percent
between 2010 and 2000, Oregon’s grew 12 percent over the same
period, and  Arizona ’s population increased more than 28 percent
between 2000 and 2009, U.S. Census Bureau data show.  Asians Fastest-Growing  Non-Hispanic Asians were California’s fastest-growing
ethnic group, rising 30.9 percent to 4.8 million over the past
10 years. They now comprise 12.8 percent of the state’s
population, up from 10.8 percent a decade ago, the data show.  California’s Hispanic population rose 27.8 percent to 14
million, or 37.6 percent of the population. Non-Hispanic whites
declined 5.4 percent to 15 million or 40.1 percent of the
population. Blacks declined 0.8 percent to 2.2 million or 5.8
percent of the population.    Los Angeles , the largest county in the state, saw its
population climb 3.1 percent to 9.8 million since 2000, the
census data showed. Beyond the coast, Riverside County saw its
population climb 41.7 percent to 2.19 million, while San
Bernardino County’s population rose 19.1 percent to 2 million.  While the housing bust has caused property values to fall
and unemployment to rise in the inland counties, many foreclosed
homes are quickly sold and reoccupied, according to David
Swanson, a professor of sociology at the  University of
California , Riverside.  “We don’t have the kind of housing-abandonment problem you
see in other parts of the country,” Swanson said. “We had the
inland regions booming prior to the housing crisis and we’re
ending up finding the inland grew faster than the rest of the
state at the end of the decade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
