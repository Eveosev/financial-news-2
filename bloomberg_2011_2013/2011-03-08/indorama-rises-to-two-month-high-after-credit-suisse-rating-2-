  Indorama Ventures Pcl (IVL) , a Thai
chemical maker, rose to a two-month high in Bangkok trading
after Credit Suisse Group AG rated the stock “outperform” in
new coverage.  The shares jumped 7.6 percent to 49.50 baht at the 4:30 p.m.
close, the highest since Jan. 7. The stock was the second-best
performer in the SET50 Index, a measure of the 50 largest
publicly traded companies.  Indorama’s strengths are its “aggressive” growth plan and
“successful” track record in past acquisitions, Credit Suisse
analysts Paworamon Suvarnatemee and Puchong Kometsopha wrote in
a note today. The brokerage set its share-price estimate at 62
baht.  “With acquisition talks in the pipeline, we see potential
upside to Indorama’s plan to grow capacity beyond its current
target of 10 million tons in 2014,” Paworamon and Puchong said.
The surge in cotton prices has also widened the company’s profit
margin from polyester products, they said.  Indorama plans to invest about $3.8 billion between 2011
and 2014 to acquire businesses and build new plants, Chief
Executive Officer Aloke Lohia said on Feb. 22. This year, it
plans to spend $1 billion on investments, compared with a $200
million outlay last year, he said.  The company expects sales to increase 70 percent this year
from $3 billion in 2010 on high prices and increased capacity,
Lohia said. Indorama is considering six agreements to acquire
new businesses, and may build plants in the Middle East and  India , Lohia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
