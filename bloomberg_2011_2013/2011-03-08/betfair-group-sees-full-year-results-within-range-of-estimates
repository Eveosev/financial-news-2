  Betfair Group Plc (BET) , the U.K. online
betting exchange that sold shares in October, said it was
confident full-year results would be “within the range” of
analyst estimates.  So-called core-revenue rose 6.2 percent, led by sports
betting, to 77 million pounds ($125 million) in the fiscal third
quarter, the London-based company said in a statement on
Regulatory News Service. The betting exchange will operate under
a Gibraltar license with effect from tomorrow.  Sports betting grew even though some horse races were
canceled because of poor weather in December, leading to 4
percent fewer meetings in the quarter, the company said. Betfair
follows U.K. bookmakers such as  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  and  William Hill
Plc (WMH)  in moving some operations to Gibraltar to save tax.  “We are pleased with the growth we achieved in the third
quarter, especially from football and games,” Chief Executive
Officer David Yu said in the statement. “We remain confident
that we will deliver an outcome for the current financial year
within the range of market expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
