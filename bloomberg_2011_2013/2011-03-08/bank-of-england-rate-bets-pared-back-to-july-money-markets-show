Investors are betting the  Bank of
England  will boost borrowing costs in July, scaling back earlier
predictions of a June increase, money-market rates show.  Forward contracts on the sterling overnight interbank
average, or Sonia, show investors are speculating that the
central bank will raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis
points at its July 7 meeting, according to data by Tullett
Prebon Plc. The gauge on March 4 showed a 25 basis-point
increase at the June meeting.  Short-sterling futures rose, pushing the implied yield on
the contract maturing in June 2011 down two basis points to 1.06
percent as investors trimmed bets borrowing costs will rise. The
yield was 0.90 percent at the end of last year.  U.K. policy makers will maintain the rate at a record low
of 0.5 percent on March 10, according to all 61 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The change means the Bank of England will raise borrowing
costs the same month as the  European Central Bank , Deutsche Bank
AG data show. The Frankfurt-based ECB will raise its main
refinancing rate, currently at an all-time low of 1 percent, by
25 basis points by its July meeting, according to forward
contracts on the euro overnight index average, or Eonia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
