  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  said it plans to
improve its capital structure by selling subordinated bonds and
offering to exchange 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion) of its
existing notes for new debt.    Germany ’s second-biggest lender plans to sell unsecured 10-
year notes denominated in euros, Frankfurt-based Commerzbank
said today in a statement. The lender invited holders of its
1.25 billion euros of subordinated notes due 2016 and 750
million euros of debt due 2017 to exchange the securities for
new bonds due 2019. The offer is expected to end on March 17.  Commerzbank, which tapped Germany for 18.2 billion euros of
state aid during the global financial crisis, sold shares to
help boost capital in January as it prepares for new banking
regulation. Leaders of the Group of 20 nations in November
endorsed rules, known as Basel III, which will more than triple
the highest-quality capital that banks must hold.  “Most banks will be looking to tidy up their  capital
structure  and borrowing in light of Basel III,” said  Gary Jenkins , head of fixed income at Evolution Securities Ltd. in
London.  The 4.125 percent subordinated notes due in 2016 jumped
5.96 cents to 91.68 cents on the euro as of 1:24 p.m., the
highest in four months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The cost to protect Commerzbank’s subordinated debt from default
fell to the lowest since November, declining as much as 41.25
basis points to 341.75 basis points before leveling off at 360,
according to CMA.  Tier 2 Structure  Today’s transactions are aimed at “a long-term
optimization” of the bank’s Tier 2 capital structure before
Basel III, the bank said. They will not have a direct impact on
the bank’s core Tier 1 or Tier 1 capital levels, it said.
Commerzbank’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial
strength, was 10 percent at the end of December, up from 9.2
percent a year earlier.  Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc. and
Commerzbank are managing the bond offering and debt swap,
according to the statement.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
