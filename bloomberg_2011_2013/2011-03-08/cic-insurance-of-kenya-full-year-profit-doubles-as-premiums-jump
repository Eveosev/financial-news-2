The Co-Operative Insurance Co. , a
Kenyan insurer that plans to begin trading on the  Nairobi Stock
Exchange , said full-year profit doubled as premiums jumped.  Net income increased to 512 million shillings ($6.18
million) in the 12 months through December, from 246 million
shillings a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Nelson Kuria
told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. Gross premiums
surged 59 percent to 4.57 billion shillings, he said.  CIC, the eighth-largest of Kenya’s 44 insurance companies,
is wholly owned by a co-operative, a business run by a group of
individuals for their mutual benefit.  Co-operative Bank of Kenya
Ltd. (COOP) , the country’s fifth-biggest lender by market value,
increased its stake in CIC to 21 percent in October.  The insurer plans to begin trading its shares on the
domestic bourse by 2013 to fund its expansion into  Africa  and
broaden its product range, Kuria said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
