  Ford Motor Co. (F)  awarded Chief
Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  $56.5 million in stock, and
Executive Chairman  Bill Ford  received $42.4 million in shares as
a reward for the automaker’s turnaround.  Ford paid the unrestricted stock to its top two executives
as part of an incentive plan for 2009 and 2010, according to
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ford
earned $9.28 billion in the last two years after $30.1 billion
in losses from 2006 through 2008. The shares, which traded as
low as $1.01 on Nov. 20, 2008, rose 46 cents to $14.47 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The executives will receive other compensation for 2010,
including salary and benefits, which will be revealed in a proxy
report in the coming weeks, said  John Stoll , a company
spokesman. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford withheld some of the
stock awards to cover their income taxes. After taxes, Mulally
received $33.4 million and Bill Ford got $25.1 million.  “This is an indication of the performance that the company
has experienced under Alan Mulally and Bill Ford’s leadership,”
Stoll said today in an interview. “Ford is committed to
aligning executive compensation to the company’s performance and
long-term  shareholder value .”  Mulally, 65, also received 884,433 stock options with a
strike price of $14.76, which he can exercise until 2021, and he
was awarded 543,734 restricted stock units that can be converted
into shares in 2013.  Bill Ford, 53, received 412,735  stock options  with a strike
price of $14.76, which he can exercise until 2021, and he was
awarded 253,742 restricted stock units that can be converted
into shares in 2013, according to the filings.  ‘Too Expensive’  “There’s no question they’re doing a very good job and
Mulally is responsible for keeping the company afloat and out of
bankruptcy,” said Gary Bradshaw, a  fund manager  at Dallas-based
Hodges Capital Management, which owns about 175,000 Ford common
shares and about 50,000 preferred shares. “But that kind of
money sounds awful excessive. On the surface, it sounds too
expensive.”  The size of the stock awards could make it difficult for
Ford to negotiate a new contract this year with the  United Auto
Workers  union, Bradshaw said. Ford’s contract with the UAW,
which represents 40,600 of its U.S. workers, expires in
September.  “When they’re negotiating with the union, this is going to
get thrown right back at them,” said Bradshaw, who continues to
buy Ford shares.  Ford said Jan. 28 that it is paying bonus checks averaging
$5,000 to its U.S. hourly workers, the largest payout since
2000. Michele Martin, a spokeswoman for the UAW, did not
immediately respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
