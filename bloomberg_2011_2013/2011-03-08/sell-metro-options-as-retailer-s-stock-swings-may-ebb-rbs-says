Investors should sell  Metro AG (MEO) 
options to bet on narrower stock swings because  Germany ’s
largest retailer already gave guidance for 2010 earnings it will
report March 22,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  said.  Equity-derivatives strategist Bhavin Patel recommended
selling Metro’s April 49 euro put and April 54 call, a strategy
known as a “strangle” that makes money for the seller if the
stock is less volatile and doesn’t move outside of the range
between the strikes. The shares lost 0.2 percent to 51.47 euros
yesterday and are down 4.5 percent this year.  The company’s stores in Eastern Europe have had “solid
performance,” boosted by Russia and  Turkey , which offset weaker
results from countries like Greece and  Hungary , Patel wrote,
citing RBS retail analyst Justin Scarborough.  Operating profit excluding some items probably met Metro’s
own forecast for 2.3 billion euros in 2010, the retailer said in
January. That compares with the 2.25 billion euro average of 15
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Metro’s fourth-quarter
sales missed analysts’ estimates after bad weather crimped
holiday shopping, the company said in January.  Selling options makes sense because implied volatility, the
key gauge of option prices, has been rising compared with
realized swings, he said. Implied volatility for 30-day at-the-
money contracts has risen to 27.43 from a two-month low of 23.26
on Feb. 11, according to Bloomberg data. That’s higher than the
10-day realized volatility of 14.53 and 20.85 for 30 days.  “Realized volatility has fallen sharply with both short
and longer term measures declining,” Patel wrote. “It
therefore seems attractive to sell Metro options.”  While sales in Eastern Europe are among “longer-term
investment attractions,” the stock is more expensive than
rivals, trading at 15.2 times forecast 2011 earnings versus 12.9
for the industry group, Patel wrote.  “The company has already guided toward the FY10 numbers
due to be released on March 22,” Patel wrote. “Consequently,
it will be the outlook for 2011 that will be closely watched.”  Scarborough rates the Duesseldorf, Germany-based company at
“hold” and has a 49 euro share-price forecast. Selling the
strangle starts to lose money at expiration if the shares fall
below about 47.1 euros or rise above 55.9 euros, Patel wrote.  Calls give the right to buy a security for a certain
amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the right
to sell. Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in
the price of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves
or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
