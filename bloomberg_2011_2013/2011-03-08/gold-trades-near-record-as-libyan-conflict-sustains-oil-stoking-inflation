Gold declined in  Asia  as a rally to
record prices, driven by escalating turmoil in Libya and rising
inflation, prompted some investors to lock in gains.  Immediate-delivery bullion fell as much as 0.4 percent to
$1,426.28 an ounce before trading at $1,427.70 at 2:36 p.m. in
Singapore. The metal climbed to an all-time high of $1,444.95
yesterday. The April-delivery contract in  New York  decreased 0.5
percent. Oil lost 0.7 percent, retreating from a 29-month high.  “There are healthy sales that allow the market to take a
break after a recent bull run,” said Chae Un Soo, a Seoul-based
trader with KEB Futures Co. “There’s great buying interest in
the metal, unless the picture in the Middle East gets better.”  Libyan rebels moved along the coast toward Tripoli and
government troops loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  escalated their use
of force. Surging food and commodity prices contributed to
unrest that toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt with protests
erupting in countries including Iran, Yemen and Oman.  The  United Nations  estimated as of Feb. 26 that 1,000
people had died since the Libyan uprising began in mid-February.
In  Saudi Arabia , websites have called for a nationwide “Day of
Rage” on March 11 and March 20, according to Human Rights Watch.  Gold rallied 30 percent last year as the prospect of rising
inflation and currency debasement spurred demand for a haven.  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told the annual National
People’s Congress in Beijing on March 5 that reining in
inflation is the nation’s top priority. Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke has signaled that the Fed will complete $600
billion of Treasury purchases through June.  Cash silver declined 0.7 percent to $35.6825 an ounce after
soaring as much as 3.2 percent yesterday to $36.7525, the
highest level since 1980. Palladium for immediate delivery shed
0.9 percent to $781.75 an ounce and platinum weakened 0.6
percent to $1,809.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
