Chinese central bank adviser  Li Daokui  said the yuan’s pace of appreciation may draw less
“political attention” in a year as the trade surplus narrows.  China’s trade surplus may account for less than 2 percent
of gross domestic product by the end of this year, down from
3.03 percent in 2010, Li said after attending a meeting of the
Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference today. Wage
increases are playing a more important role in helping China
with economic restructuring than currency appreciation, he said.  “The 5 to 6 percent annual gain in the yuan and the 20
percent increase in wages are facilitating the change in China’s
export structure,” Li said in Beijing.  Yuan gains may not help curb inflation as China is a large
buyer of commodities globally, he said.  “As the yuan appreciates,  iron ore  or  oil companies  across
the world may raise their prices accordingly because they know
China’s purchasing power will increase, which will result in
zero effect on domestic inflation,” said Li.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
