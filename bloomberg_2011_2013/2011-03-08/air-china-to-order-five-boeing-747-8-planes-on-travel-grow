  Boeing Co. (BA)  won orders from Chinese
airlines for 43 wide-body planes with a  list value  of about $10
billion, including the first deal in a year for the delayed 747-
8 jumbo jet.  Hong Kong Airlines agreed to buy 32 787 Dreamliners and six
777 freighters, Chicago-based Boeing said on its  website  today.  Air China Ltd. (601111)  said separately that it will order five 747-8s.
Both accords were signed at the Hong Kong air show.  The orders underscore the importance to Boeing and Airbus
SAS of China, where passenger numbers probably will jump 69
percent by 2015, according to the nation’s industry regulator.
China will help the Asia-Pacific region account for a third of
global plane deliveries over the next 20 years, Boeing said.  “Many airlines in this region are still thinking about
growing capacity and China is the major market,” said Kelvin Lau, an analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research Pte in  Hong Kong .
“Sentiment is very positive.”  Air China’s 747-8s will be delivered in 2014 and 2015,
according to a statement from the Beijing-based carrier. It said
it won “significant” discounts from the $1.54 billion list
prices. Air China is the third airline worldwide to order the
passenger plane and the first in China.  ‘Important Breakthrough’  “It’s an important breakthrough for Boeing in the context
of the 747-8 program and its role in  Asia  where A380 orders have
been strong,” said Derek Sadubin, chief operating officer at
Sydney-based consultant Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation.  While Airbus has won 244 orders for its  A380 , Boeing’s
previous total for the 747-8 Intercontinental passenger model
was  33  in about five years. A yearlong delay and a slowdown in
travel during the global recession damped demand for the
company’s biggest-ever jet.  “As we look forward, we think we have a positive business
case” for the 747-8,  Randy Tinseth , Boeing’s commercial-jet
marketing chief, said in a Bloomberg Television interview in
Hong Kong. The company sees more sales opportunities as older
747s reach retirement age and as travel rebounds, he said.  Boeing gained $1.16, or 1.6 percent, to $72.04 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 10 percent this year.  The China announcements came hours before Boeing and Airbus
shared in a narrow-body aircraft-purchase plan from
International Lease Finance Corp., the plane-leasing unit of  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  ILFC said it will order 33
Boeing 737s and plans to buy 100 Airbus jets.  Discounted Prices  Airlines and leasing companies typically pay less than list
prices for aircraft. The 747-8 is Boeing’s most-expensive
jetliner, listing for $317.5 million for the passenger model and
$319.3 million for the freighter variant.  The first passenger 747-8 rolled out Feb. 13 from Boeing’s
factory in Everett,  Washington , and its maiden flight is
scheduled for this month. The first delivery, to Deutsche
Lufthansa AG, is set for later this year. The Cologne, Germany-
based carrier ordered 20 747-8 Intercontinentals in December
2006.  Korean Air  ordered five more three years later. Eight
others have been sold for use as VIP planes.  The Intercontinental, the fifth variant of the 747,
stretches the iconic hump and carries about 467 passengers in a
typical three-class configuration. It features new engines and a
longer wing. The plane will be more efficient to operate and
more comfortable for travelers, Air China said.  Freighter Orders  The freighter version has won 74  orders  from customers
including Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., an Air  China  affiliate.
That jet has been flying for a year in tests and will be
delivered in midyear. Cargolux Airlines International SA and
Nippon Cargo Airlines Co. ordered the first freighters in 2005.  Hong Kong Airlines, which competes with Cathay Pacific, has
18 planes and is due to receive six Airbus A330s this year. The
closely held carrier, 46 percent owned by HNA Group Co., will
add its first all-business-class plane next year. The 787 order
comprised 30 of the -9 variant and two -8 planes that will be
configured for VIP travel.  HNA Group, which is controlled by the government of China’s
Hainan province, also announced orders for 10  business jets ,
consisting of five from  Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  and five from
Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.  The group’s business-jet and Boeing orders are worth almost
$10 billion at list prices, said Yang Jianhong, president of
Hong Kong Airlines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
