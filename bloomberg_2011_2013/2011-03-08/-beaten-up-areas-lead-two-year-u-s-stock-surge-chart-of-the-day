The past two years have shown that
stock investors need to focus on “the beaten-up areas of the
market” when prices rebound, according to Tobias Levkovich,
Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index’s advance since March 9, 2009, when the benchmark reached
a 12-year low, with the period’s best and worst performers among
24 industry groups in the index.  Auto-related stocks set the S&P 500’s pace, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, as the industry-group index more
than quintupled in the period through yesterday. Grocery and
drugstore stocks had the smallest overall gain, at 34 percent.  “Fears of a Great Depression reenactment provided
investors with a powerful trading opportunity over the past two
years,” Levkovich wrote today in a report. The  auto industry  is
among those most closely linked to the economy’s performance,
while food and drug retailers had less to gain from economic
growth.  The two industries’ rankings were almost exactly the
opposite in the preceding bear market, which lasted 17 months.
The S&P 500 Automobiles and Components Index tumbled 84 percent,
more than any other industry except banks. The S&P 500 Food and
Staples Retailing Index did best by losing only 26 percent.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:  David Wilson  in New York at
