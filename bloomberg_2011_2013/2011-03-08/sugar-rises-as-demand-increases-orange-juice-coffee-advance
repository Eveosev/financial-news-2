Sugar futures climbed for a second
day in  New York  on signs of increased demand for the sweetener,
even after a surge in prices during the past year.  Orange juice 
and coffee also advanced.    Thailand , the world’s second-largest sugar exporter, sold
92,000 metric tons to Louis Dreyfus Commodities, Mitsubishi
Corp., Itochu and Noble Resources at an auction, according to
state-owned Thai Cane and Sugar Corp. Prices are up 42 percent
in the past year on concern that a global production surplus may
be smaller than expected.  “There is a lot of demand,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst
at Transworld Futures in Tampa.  Raw sugar for May delivery rose 0.71 cent, or 2.4 percent,
to settle at 30.7 cents at 1:52 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. The price has doubled since June 1 and touched a 30-year
high of 36.08 cents last month.  Tintle said prices will reach 33 cents in the next few
sessions as the commodity closed above 30.5 cents today.  In  London , refined-sugar futures for May delivery climbed
$14.30, or 1.9 percent, to $763.10 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery rose 6.05 cents,
or 2.2 percent, to $2.872 a pound on ICE after reaching $2.8765,
the highest since May 1997.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for March delivery jumped
$59, or 2.5 percent, to $2,462 a ton.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery rose 2.35 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $1.769 a pound in New York, the biggest gain
since Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
