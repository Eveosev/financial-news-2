Lebanon plans to buy more wheat this
year to help keep bread prices stable, said Mohamed Zaineddin,
head of the General Directorate of Cereals and Sugar Beets.  Lebanon last month issued its first wheat tender in a year,
buying 15,000 metric tons of wheat from the U.S. and 7,500 tons
from  Ukraine , Zaineddin said in a telephone interview today.
Last year, Lebanon imported about 400,000 tons of wheat, he
said. Governments bought more grain to curb domestic prices
and quell rioting that toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt.  “The government plans to issue more wheat tenders this year
after the recent rise in wheat prices,” Zaineddin said. “This
is meant to provide the local market with subsidized flour and
bread.” Lebanon has wheat reserves to meet demand for about five
months, he said.  Protests erupted across northern  Africa  and the Middle East
in the last several months, in part driven by a surge in food
prices that the  United Nations  says rose to a record in
February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
