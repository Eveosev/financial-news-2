  Canada ’s dollar strengthened against
most major currencies a day after the price of crude oil, the
nation’s largest export, touched a 29-month high.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the aquatic bid on the C$1 coin, rose toward its highest level
versus its U.S. counterpart since November 2007, reached on
March 1. The currency gained against 14 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg as Canadian housing starts
rose more than forecast.  “People are happy to be long the Canadian dollar because
of oil,” said  John Curran , a senior vice president in Toronto
at CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign-exchange dealer. A long
position is a bet an asset will increase in value.  The loonie appreciated 0.2 percent to 97.14 cents per  U.S.
dollar  at 5:00 p.m. in Toronto, from 97.33 yesterday. It touched
96.84 cents on March 1, the strongest level since November 2007.
One Canadian dollar buys $1.0294.  Crude oil for April delivery fell as much as 2 percent to
$103.33 a barrel after touching $106.95 yesterday, the highest
level since September 2008. The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite
Index slid 0.6 percent.    Government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year
benchmark up five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
3.40 percent. The price of the 3.50 percent security maturing in
June 2020 decreased 39 cents to C$100.81.  Loonie Versus Euro  The Canadian dollar appreciated 0.8 percent to C$1.3508
versus the euro, from 1.3595 yesterday, as concern European
leaders won’t agree on a solution to the sovereign-debt crisis
damped appetite for the region’s assets.  Financing costs rose as  Greece  sold 1.6 billion euros ($2.3
billion) of treasury bills a day after its  credit rating  was cut
by Moody’s Investors Service.  “The only thing aiding the loonie is the crosses,” said  Dean Popplewell , an analyst at the online foreign-exchange
trading firm Oanda Corp. in Toronto, referring to currency pairs
not involving the U.S. dollar.  Canadian housing starts rose in February, led by urban
projects such as apartments and condominiums, according to the
federal government’s housing agency.  The annual pace of home starts rose 6.6 percent to 181,900
on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Ottawa-based Canada Mortgage
& Housing Corp. said on its website today. Economists projected
a reading of 174,000, according to the median forecast of 21
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  OPEC members are discussing whether to hold an emergency
meeting on possibly increasing oil output, Sheikh Ahmad al- Abdullah,  Kuwait ’s oil minister, told reporters.  Saudi Arabia 
and other OPEC members have pledged to ensure adequate supply to
the market as violence in Libya cuts output from Africa’s third-
largest crude producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
