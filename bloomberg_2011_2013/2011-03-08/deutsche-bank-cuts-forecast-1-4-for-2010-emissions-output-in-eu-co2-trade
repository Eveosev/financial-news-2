  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  cut its forecast
for 2010 greenhouse-gas emissions in the European Union market
by 1.4 percent, citing lower-than-forecast utility discharges.  Emissions in the program may be 1.92 billion metric tons
for the year, compared with a previous forecast of 1.95 billion,
according to an e-mailed research report yesterday from Paris-
based analysts Isabelle Curien and Mark Lewis at the bank. The
European Commission may publish verified emissions data at noon
in Brussels on April 1, they said.  The analysts cut their forecast for carbon-permit prices at
year end by 14 percent to 18 euros ($25) a metric ton from a
previous estimate of 21 euros. EU futures for December rose 0.2
percent today to close at 15.89 euros a ton on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London. Prices fell as low as 15.71 euros
earlier today.  Profit from generating power in  Germany  remains “very
depressed,” curbing the incentive to sell power in forward
markets, the analysts said. Utilities in the nation, which has
the biggest power market in the bloc and the most emissions,
usually sell power at least three years ahead.  “We do not expect to see German generators selling
significant volumes of electricity forward for 2013 delivery in
the near term,” Curien and Lewis said.  Airlines, which will join the carbon market next year, will
probably have a 2012 shortage of 20 million permits, according
to the note. That demand may not push up EU prices because
carriers may use cheaper United Nations offsets for compliance,
the analysts said. Airlines can use as many as 32 million tons
of UN credits in 2012 and as many as 48 million tons in the
eight years through 2020, Lewis said today by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
