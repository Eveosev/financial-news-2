What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that rain and snow
this week in parts of the southern Great Plains will boost yield
potential for U.S. crops, said Mike Zuzolo, the president of
Global Commodity Analytics and Consulting in Lafayette,  Indiana .  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT on speculation that rain during the past month boosted
yields in Brazil and  Argentina , Zuzolo said. Soybean-oil futures
are expected to open 0.4 cent to 0.6 cent a pound lower, and
soybean-meal futures may open steady to down $1 per 2,000
pounds.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower in  Chicago  on speculation that cheaper wheat supplies will
reduce demand for corn used in livestock feed, and as the
stronger dollar erodes speculative buying in commodities as a
hedge against inflation, Zuzolo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
