Cooking gas subsidized by the
government is undercutting  India â€™s efforts to roll out fuel
produced from renewable sources such as agricultural waste, a
government minister said.  India has installed plants in the last four years that can
produce 930,712 cubic meters of gas from manure and other
agricultural refuse, according to a written answer to parliament
today from Minister of New and Renewable Energy Farooq Abdullah.  That fell short of targets in part because of the
increasing availability of subsidized liquid petroleum gas,
Abdullah said.  India spent an estimated 470 billion rupees ($10.4 billion)
for the nine months ended Dec. 31 subsidizing fuels, Oil
Minister Jaipal Reddy said Jan 31. That calculates to 1.7
billion rupees a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
