  Andritz AG (ANDR) , the Austrian maker of
machines for the paper and steel industries, rose the most in
three months in Vienna trading after its full-year net income
beat analyst estimates and it said it is expecting 2011 sales to
“increase substantially compared to 2010” and net income to
rise.  Andritz rose 4.6 percent to 64.38 euros at the 5:30 a.m.
close of trading in the Austrian capital, its biggest increase
since Dec. 2.  “The positive market situation should continue for the
hydro, pulp & paper, and environment & process business areas,”
Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Leitner said in a statement
today. “I also anticipate good project activity for both
segments within feed & biofuel, however only the metals business
area should continue to face a more subdued economic
environment.”  Net income for 2010 rose 86 percent to 179.6 million euros
($250 million). It was expected to report 157.9 million euros
profit, according to the estimates of ten analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales for 2010 rose 11 percent to 3.55 billion euros,
beating the 3.43 billion-euro estimate of eleven analysts.  Andritz is proposing to increase its dividend for 2010 to
1.7 euros a share from 1 euro a year earlier. That beats the
dividend forecast of 1.55 euros, according to Bloomberg research
and analysis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
