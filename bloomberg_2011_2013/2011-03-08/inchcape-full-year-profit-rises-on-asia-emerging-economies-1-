  Inchcape Plc (INCH) , a global operator of  car dealerships , said 2010 profit climbed 39 percent on higher
sales in  Asia ,  Russia  and  South America .  Net income rose to 127.9 million pounds ($207 million),
from 92 million pounds a year earlier, the London-based company
said in a statement today. Sales climbed 5.4 percent, ahead of
the company’s forecasts, to 5.89 billion pounds.  Inchcape, which represents brands such as Land Rover and
Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, will benefit this year from demand
for premium cars in emerging markets, Chief Executive Officer
Andre Lacroix said in a phone interview.  “The important point is that we are uniquely placed in
that 65 percent of our profit comes from the emerging markets
and we expect the premium segment to grow in these regions,”
Lacroix said. “We are comfortable with consensus estimates for
2011,” he said, without disclosing figures.  Pretax profit for 2011 is seen at 219.8 million pounds, the
mean of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Pretax profit before
exceptional items was 214 million pounds last year.  Inchcape shares rose 2.1 pence, or 0.5 percent, at 393.6
pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , giving the company a
market value of 1.8 billion pounds.  Margin ‘Pressure’  The car dealer expects “pressure” on gross margins this
year because of price competition in markets where demand for
cars is weak and raw material costs such as steel are rising.  “Looking to the immediate future, due to the uneven nature
of the economic recovery, we remain cautious regarding the
short-term industry outlook in some of our markets,” Lacroix
said in the statement. “However, given our strong track record
and the industry recovery in most of our markets, we expect the
group to deliver a solid performance in 2011.”  Inchcape anticipates market declines this year in  Singapore ,  Greece , Belgium and the U.K., which provide half the
company’s sales.  “Fiscal year 2011 is unlikely to deliver the same rate of
profit before tax growth seen in fiscal year 2010,” because of
the anticipated decline in the car market in the U.K.,
Singapore, Greece and Belgium, David Jeary, an analyst with
Investec Securities ,said in an e-mailed note to investors
today. Jeary recommends buying the stock. Investec raised its
pretax profit forecast for 2011 from 215 million pounds to 223
million pounds.  Inchcape said it recommended the resumption of dividend
payments, with a final dividend of 6.6 pence a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
