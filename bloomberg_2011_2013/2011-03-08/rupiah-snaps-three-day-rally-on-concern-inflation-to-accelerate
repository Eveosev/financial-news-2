  Indonesia ’s rupiah fell, snapping a
three-day advance, on speculation oil prices around a 29-month
high will hurt economic growth and stoke inflation.  Crude oil in  New York  has climbed 15.1 percent this year on
concern the political turmoil in the Middle East and North
Africa will escalate, disrupting global supplies. The fuel is
now trading 1.7 percent lower after touching $106.95 a barrel
this week, the highest level since September 2008.  “Higher energy prices will cause other prices to increase,
and this will probably have a negative impact on consumption and
growth,” said Mika Martumpal, a senior market analyst at PT
Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “It’s something that not just
Indonesia has to monitor, but other economies as well.”  The rupiah lost 0.1 percent to 8,789 per dollar as of 9:53
a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency has gained 2.2 percent this year, the best performance
among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies.  Gross domestic product may expand by as much as 6.5 percent
this year after having risen 6.1 percent in 2010, according to
the central bank.  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy rose
6.84 percent in February from a year earlier after having
increased 7.02 percent the previous month, an official report
showed last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
