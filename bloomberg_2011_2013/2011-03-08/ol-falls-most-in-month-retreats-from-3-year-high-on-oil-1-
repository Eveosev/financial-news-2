Mol Nyrt. fell the most in a month
as oil declined for the first time in three days, putting margin
pressure on  Hungary ’s largest refiner.  Mol slid 2.5 percent to 23,695 forint by the 5 p.m. close
in Budapest, helping push the benchmark BUX index 1.3 percent
lower. Mol, which has a 33 percent weighting in the gauge, was
unchanged at 24,300 forint yesterday, the highest level since
December 2007.  “The oil price has been pulling the sector higher, now
there’s profit taking,” Tamas Gerocs, an analyst at Equilor
Befektetesi Zrt., said by phone from Budapest.  Crude slipped as much as 2 percent today as  Kuwait ’s oil
minister said Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
members are considering whether to convene an “urgent meeting”
to determine whether more output is needed.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
