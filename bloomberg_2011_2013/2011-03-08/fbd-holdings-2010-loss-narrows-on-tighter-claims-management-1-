  FBD Holdings Plc (FBH) , an Irish insurer,
said its full-year net loss narrowed on rate increases, fewer
losses on property and tighter claims management.  The net loss fell to 2.4 million euros ($3.35 million) from
30.2 million euros in 2009, the Dublin-based company said in a
statement on the Regulatory News Service today. Severe weather
conditions partially masked the effect of its improved
performance.  FBD said asset values declined by 50 million euros, and the
potential for “further downside” is limited. Loss per share
for 2010 was 8.08 cents against 91.6 the previous year.  “The severe weather conditions in January and December
partially masked the benefit of rate increases, underwriting
discipline and proactive management of claims and expenses,”
Andrew Langford, chief executive officer, said in the statement.
“The group has a strong capital base and balance sheet.”  Profit from operations climbed 41 percent to 40.7 million
euros as the company continued to reduce costs, FBD said.  FBD plans to pay a final dividend of 21 cents per share,
giving a total for the year of 31.5 cents, up from 30 cents in
2009. The insurer’s “prudent” handling of reserves brings its
solvency level to 61 percent of net earned premium, from 52
percent in 2009, according to the statement.  The company’s market share rose to 11.8 percent last year
from 11.5 percent in 2009, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
