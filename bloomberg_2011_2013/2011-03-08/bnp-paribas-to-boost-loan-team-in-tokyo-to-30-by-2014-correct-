  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  Europe ’s biggest
bank by assets, plans to boost Tokyo staff handling loans to
fund infrastructure projects, acquisitions and trade as more
Japanese companies seek business outside the Asian nation.  The Paris-based lender plans to increase headcount at its
Tokyo structured finance unit to about 30 from 18 by 2014, Eiji
Kamiyabu, head of structured finance at BNP’s branch in the
Japanese capital, said in an interview. The firm is playing a
bigger role as a senior arranger of loans and expects more deals,
he said.  The Tokyo unit helped arrange a total of 900 billion yen
($10.9 billion) in loans for 27 projects last year. The bank
arranged funding for a thermal power project in  Indonesia  in
2008, Kamiyabu said.  Nippon Export and Investment Insurance, known as  NEXI , has
guaranteed about 1.4 trillion yen in loans since April 1, three
times the amount from five years earlier, according to company
estimates.  -- With translation by Go Onomitsu in Tokyo. Editors: Hugh Chow,
