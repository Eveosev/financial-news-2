  Europe ’s chemical industry will
probably make fewer large acquisitions in coming years as many
companies have finished restructuring and will exercise caution
after the financial crisis, said Karl Nietvelt, co-coordinator
of chemicals coverage at  Standard & Poor’s .  European chemical makers have had difficulty finding
suitable targets in  Asia , the region expected to show the
fastest growth this decade, Nietvelt said. Companies with a lot
of cash could buck the trend, he said.  “We think companies aren’t going to stretch their balance
sheets for acquisitions,” Nietvelt said. “They will maintain
prudent financial policies with the recent financial crisis
still fresh in their minds. Some deals will happen but we
believe a significant number has already happened.”  The European  chemical industry  has had $21 billion in deals
in the past 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. The largest
is DuPont Co.’s $6.8 billion offer in January to buy Denmark’s
Danisco A/S, a maker of food additives and enzymes used in
biofuels.  Many companies are targeting 50 percent of sales from Asia
by 2015, Nietvelt said. Chemical demand in the Asia-Pacific
region is likely to grow to 2.6 trillion euros ($3.6 trillion)
by 2020, making up almost half of world demand, up from 39
percent, S&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
