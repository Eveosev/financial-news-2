Wheat fell for a second day in  Chicago  after a government report showed steady or improved
winter-crop conditions in major U.S. growing areas. Corn slid
for a third day, while rice and soybeans also declined.  Winter-wheat conditions in  Kansas  and Texas were unchanged
from last week and crops in Oklahoma improved, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said yesterday. Wheat yesterday
plunged 3.8 percent, the most in almost two weeks, and is down
5.5 percent since the end of January.  “The brighter outlook for U.S. winter wheat is a factor
here, as the dry conditions in the major growing areas are set
to improve due to rainfall,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in a report today.  Wheat for May delivery fell 6.25 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$7.945 a bushel at 1:14 p.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Milling wheat for March delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris dropped for a seventh day, losing 2.9 percent to 241.25
euros ($335.17) a metric ton.  About 25 percent of the crop in  Kansas , the biggest U.S.
winter-wheat grower, was in good or excellent condition as of
March 6, unchanged from the end of February, the USDA said.
About 18 percent of  Texas  crops were good to excellent,
unchanged from last week, and 22 percent of the Oklahoma crop
was good to excellent, up from 19 percent, the report showed.  Winter wheat is planted in the U.S. Midwest and central and
southern Plains from September to early November, and goes
dormant until about March. It is harvested from June to August.  Iraq will buy 400,000 tons of wheat from the U.S. and  Australia , Muthanna Jabbar, director-general of the Iraqi Grains
Board, said yesterday.  Rice for May delivery declined 27.5 cents, or 2 percent, to
$13.67 per 100 pounds in Chicago. The grain dropped 1.7 percent
yesterday.  Corn for May delivery fell 5.5 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$7.12 a bushel after losing 1.4 percent yesterday. Soybeans for
May delivery shed 10 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $13.85 a bushel.
The oilseed declined 1.3 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
