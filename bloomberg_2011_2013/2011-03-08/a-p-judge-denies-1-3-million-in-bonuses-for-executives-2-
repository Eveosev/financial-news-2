Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (GAPTQ) ,
the bankrupt grocery store operator, sued Royal Ahold NV’s Stop
& Shop Supermarket unit for hiring its second most senior
operations executive after he agreed not to work for a
competitor for 18 months.  A&P filed the suit against Stop & Shop and Frank R. Vitale,
the former vice president of operations, today in federal court
in Brooklyn,  New York . It accuses Vitale of disclosing trade
secrets and “key elements” of its restructuring strategy to
its rival. It seeks $1 million in compensatory damages and
$1 million in punitive damages from Stop & Shop.  Vitale “was the second most senior operator at A&P and one
of only two regional vice presidents until his abrupt
resignation on Feb. 14,” according to the complaint.  A&P, based in Montvale,  New Jersey , filed for bankruptcy in
December after failing to turn around its business amid
increased competition from wholesale clubs and drugstores. It
operates supermarkets under names including Waldbaum’s, Food
Emporium and Pathmark.  Arlene Putterman, a Stop & Shop spokeswoman, didn’t have an
immediate comment.  The case is  Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (GAP)  v. Stop & Shop
Supermarket Co., 11-cv-1641, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of New York (Brooklyn). A&P’s bankruptcy case is Re The
Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. 10-24549,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
