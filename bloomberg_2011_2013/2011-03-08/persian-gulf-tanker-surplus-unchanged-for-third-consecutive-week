A surplus of supertankers competing
for 2 million-barrel cargoes of Middle East oil stayed unchanged
for a third consecutive week.  There are 10 percent more very large crude carriers, or
VLCCs, for hire over the next 30 days than there are likely
cargoes, according to the median estimate of five shipbrokers
and an owner surveyed today. That’s the same as the past two
weeks.  Returns from the Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route that’s used to
settle freight derivatives gained 71 percent to $23,827 a day
last week, according to the  Baltic Exchange  in  London .  That’s still below the $30,100 that that Frontline Ltd.,
the world’s biggest VLCC operator, says it needs to break even
on the ships.  To contact the reporter on this story:
