  Buckle Inc. (BKE)  put volume jumped to its
highest level since August before the teen retailer reports
earnings on March 10, with most of the trading in contracts with
a strike price 4.8 percent below yesterday’s close.  More than 2,000 puts to sell the stock changed hands as of
11:30 a.m. in New York, 28 times the four-week average and 523
times the number of calls to buy. The most-active contracts were
the March $35 puts, which accounted for almost all options
volume and gained 44 percent to 65 cents. These contracts had an
open interest of 194 before today. Kearney, Nebraska-based
Buckle rose 0.1 percent to $36.80.  The retailer will post fourth-quarter profit of $1 a share
excluding some items, according to the average of 11 analysts’
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Buckle outperformed third-
quarter earnings projections by 6.6 percent. Last week U.S.
retailers posted a gain in same-store sales in February that
surpassed analysts’ estimates.  Buckle’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option
prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to
41.10 from yesterday’s 40.60.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
