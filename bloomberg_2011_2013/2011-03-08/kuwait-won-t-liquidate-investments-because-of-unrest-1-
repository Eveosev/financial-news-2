  Kuwait  won’t liquidate investments
in countries experiencing unrest, Finance Minister Mustafa al- Shimali said.  “Kuwait will change investment policies in these
countries, yes, but will not liquidate” investments, al-Shimali
told reporters in parliament today. The minister declined to
provide details of planned policy changes.  More than two months of protests have rocked the Middle
East and North Africa as citizens demand civil rights, higher  living standards  and the ouster of entrenched autocratic
regimes. Governments from Jordan to Yemen have offered
concessions to quell public discontent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
