  Linc Energy Ltd. (LNC) , which converts
coal into liquid fuels, is in talks with three to four groups to
sell an Australian coal asset valued at more than A$500 million
($506 million), Chief Executive Officer  Peter Bond  said.  Negotiations are on for the Teresa mine in Queensland’s
Galilee basin, Bond said today on the sidelines of a media
presentation in Sydney. He didn’t specify a timeframe for the
transaction.  “We’re firming up the asset to make it look attractive for
a buyer,” Bond said. The buyers are “the usual suspects from  Australia ,  China  and the Americas and also a couple of second
tier ones,” he said.  Linc sold the Galilee coal asset for A$3 billion in cash
and royalties to  India ’s Adani Enterprises Ltd. in August, the
biggest acquisition by an Indian company in Australia. Demand
for coal from steel and power producers has spurred mining
companies to add assets. Alpha Natural Resources Inc. agreed on
Jan. 29 to buy Massey Energy Co. for $7.1 billion in cash and
stock, the biggest deal in the industry’s history.  “Similarly to the Adani deal, Teresa is now building
momentum,” Bond said.  Linc Energy shares gained as much as 1.4 percent to A$2.89
and traded at A$2.86 as of 3:18 p.m. in Sydney. The stock has
gained about 8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
