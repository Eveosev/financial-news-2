Sun Resorts Ltd.’s opening of its  Long Beach  Hotel is poised to boost revenue by 30 percent in
fiscal 2011, said Arnaud Dalais, chairman of  Mauritius ’s second-
largest leisure operator by market value.  The 255-room resort that cost 2.6 billion rupees ($90
million) to build is scheduled to open April 2 on the eastern
coast of the Indian Ocean island nation, Dalais, who took over
as chairman on Feb. 21, said in a March 4 interview in Ebene,
nine miles south of the capital,  Port Louis .  “We expect the hotel’s occupancy rate to exceed 60 percent
at the start of the high season in early October and revenue for
2011 is forecast to rise by 30 percent,” he said. “It’s a
concept that’s new to the country, very modern, and the response
has been very positive.”  Earnings by the country’s hotel operators are under
pressure because of the rupee’s strength against the euro and
pound, which may force hoteliers to cut costs, Dalais said. Sun
Resorts’ profit for the year through December declined 36
percent to 230.2 million rupees as  Europe , the main market for
visitors, grappled with a debt crisis.  “We expect net income to improve in 2011,” Dalais said,
without giving specific figures.  The group’s debt  rose 50 percent  to 3 billion rupees in
2010, following investments in Long Beach. Management expects to
recoup funds through the Investment Hotel Scheme, a sale and
lease-back plan approved by the government that applies to 90
rooms and suites at Long Beach.  Cut Debt  “The implementation of the scheme, the first of its kind in
Mauritius, will allow us to cut back significantly our debt
level,” Dalais said.  Mauritius had 112 registered hotels with total room
capacity of 12,075 by the end of last year, the statistics
office said Feb. 25. Hotel revenue is expected to rise 7.7
percent to 42.5 billion rupees in 2011, the Port Louis-based
data agency said. The country plans to boost tourist arrivals to
1 million visitors this year, Karl Mootoosamy, director of the
country’s tourism promotion agency, said on Jan. 26.  Dalais is also chairman of CIEL Group, an  investment
company  that employs more than 20,000 people through three
businesses, CIEL Agro-Industry, CIEL Textile and  CIEL Investment
Ltd. (CIEL) , though which the group owns 30 percent of Sun Resorts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
