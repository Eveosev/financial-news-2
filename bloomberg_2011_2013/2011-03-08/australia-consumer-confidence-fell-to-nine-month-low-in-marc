Australian consumer confidence fell
to a nine-month low in March on expectations that rising
gasoline prices and a carbon tax will lower household incomes.  The sentiment index fell 2.4 percent to 104.1 from a month
ago, according to a  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne
Institute survey of 1,200 consumers taken Feb. 28-March 6 and
released today in Sydney.  Crude  oil prices  rose to a 29-month high this week after
violence in Libya, Africa’s third-largest crude producer. In
Australia, gasoline prices rose 2 percent over the week of the
survey, Westpac said.  “We expect that respondents are expecting more substantial
increases in prices in the near term and these negative
expectations will have influenced the survey,”  Bill Evans , the
bank’s chief economist, said in an e-mailed statement.  Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  on Feb. 24 said the
nation will set a price on carbon emissions next year. The
prospect of the tax is “the key negative for households which
is highlighted by the prominence of budget/taxation in their
assessments,” Evans said.    Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens left the
overnight cash rate target at 4.75 percent last week, after
seven increases from October 2009 to November 2011.  “Evidence from this report that consumer confidence is at
its lowest level since June 2010 and households are particularly
concerned about their own finances, provides the bank with ample
scope to observe developments,” said Evans, who doesn’t expect
an increase in rates until the September quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
