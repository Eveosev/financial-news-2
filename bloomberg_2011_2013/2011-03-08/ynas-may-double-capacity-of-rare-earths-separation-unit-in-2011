Lynas Corp. may double its capacity
to process rare earths next year, provided that the Australian
company secures funding shortly, Chief Operating Officer Eric
Noyrez said.  “Our separation unit being built in  Malaysia  will be ready
in the third quarter,” Noyrez said at a parliamentary hearing
in Paris today. “Provided that we close the financing in a few
days, this site will be doubled a year after.”  Rare earths are 17 chemically similar elements used by
companies such as Toyota Motor Corp., Apple Inc. and Raytheon
Co. They include neodymium, cerium and lanthanum used in sonar
systems, flat-screen TVs and computers.  Lynas, based in Sydney, is set to become the first new
source of rare earths outside China in at least two decades with
the start up this year of the A$535 million ($540 million) Mt.
Weld project in  Australia . Ore production will begin this month
at the mine, which Lynas says has the world’s richest deposit of
rare earths.    China  will start importing rare earths from 2014 as demand
grows, Noyrez said. The country controls more than 95 percent of
the world’s rare earths.  To contact the reporter on this story:
