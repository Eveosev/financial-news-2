Sina Corp., owner of  China ’s third-
most visited website, rose the most in almost two months after
an online news service reported the company started a location-
based check-in service.  The shares jumped 7.2 percent to $88.73 at 4:30 p.m. New
York time, the most since Jan. 11.  Sina, which owns the Twitter-like Weibo, added a mobile
check-in service called WeiLingDi,  thenextweb.com  reported
yesterday, without saying how it obtained the information.  “Weibo represents one of the top five most important Web
entities in China and with the mobile check-in service, we
believe Sina is moving to control the real-time Web in China,”
said  Gene Munster , a senior analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. in
Minneapolis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
