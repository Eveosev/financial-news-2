  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi will add models
and expand production in emerging markets as the luxury brand
aims to topple  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  as the largest
premium-car maker.  “We expect further growth in the long term,” Chief
Executive Officer  Rupert Stadler  said today at Audi’s annual
press conference in Ingolstadt,  Germany . “This gives us the
confidence to extend our product range and expand our
international activities.”  The VW division has a goal of overtaking BMW as the biggest
luxury-auto maker by 2015, boosted by growth in China, India and  Brazil . Deliveries in Russia are projected to more than double.
Last year, it introduced an updated version of its A8 flagship
sedan, the new A7 Sportback as well as the A1 subcompact, the
smallest model in its 36-vehicle portfolio.  Audi, which will roll out 13 new or upgraded models this
year, including the revamped A6 sedan and Q3 compact sport-
utility vehicle, plans to continue expanding its lineup in the
coming years at “an undiminished pace,” the carmaker said
today.  Net income last year doubled to 2.59 billion euros ($3.61
billion) as growing demand in  China  and the U.S. spurred vehicle
sales to record levels, Audi said. Revenue rose 19 percent to
35.4 billion euros.  Volkswagen’s preferred shares rose as much as 2.8 percent
to 119.20 euros and were up 1 percent to 117.10 euros at 2:29
p.m. in  Frankfurt , valuing the company 51.9 billion euros.  ‘Factories Buzzing’  The brand aims to increase 2011 sales by more than 10
percent to over 1.2 million autos with new models also including
the RS3 Sportback and a hybrid Q5 SUV. Audi targets a 2011
operating margin of about 9.4 percent of sales, the carmaker
said today. The return on sales may run between 8 percent and 10
percent per year through 2015, Chief Financial Officer Axel Strotbek said in an interview.  “Our factories are buzzing,” Stadler said. “2011 will
mark another year with great workload for us.”  Audi sees “considerable potential” in  India , Brazil and
Russia, and will expand local production to underpin its
expansion, Stadler said. Sales in Russia will probably rise to
about 50,000 vehicles a year by 2015 from about 18,000 now,  Peter Schwarzenbauer , Audi’s sales chief, said today.  In addition to investment at its Chinese joint ventures,
the VW unit plans to spend 11.6 billion euros worldwide on new
plants, products and technologies in the next five years with
more than 5 billion euros earmarked for its two German plants.  Factory Expansion  “Growth fundamentals in China remain solid,” said Aleksej Wunrau, a BHF-Bank AG analyst in Frankfurt with an
“overweight” rating on VW stock. “It’s anything but a wrong
strategy to keep the focus there. Even local production in  Russia  may be worth considering for Audi.”  Expansion also includes European sites. Audi will spend
about 900 million euros over the next three years on its factory
in Gyor,  Hungary , to increase capacity to 125,000 cars from
38,500 last year. Audi will spend another 270 million euros on a
factory in Brussels, where production of the A1 model will be
increased by 20 percent to 120,000 units. Work on a new engine-
testing facility at the German plant in Neckarsulm costs 90
million euros and will be completed next year.  Audi expects China, the world’s biggest auto market, to
continue to expand “at a high pace” over the medium term and
is currently enlarging its factory in Changchun, where the VW
unit took steps in 2009 to raise capacity to 300,000 units,
according to Stadler.  “We want to participate in that momentum again in 2011,”
the CEO said. Audi increased Chinese sales by 43 percent to
227,900 cars and SUVs last year, underpinning its leading
position in the country’s premium segment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
