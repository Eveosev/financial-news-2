  RHI AG (RHI) , an Austrian maker of
fireproof materials, will pay its first dividend since it
scrapped the payout for the 2001 business year, when it almost
collapsed under debt and asbestos-related U.S. lawsuits.  Vienna-based RHI proposed to pay 0.5 euros a share, beating
the average estimate of 0.281 euros in a Bloomberg survey of 10
analysts. Four of the analysts expected no dividend payment at
all. Net income at the group, which makes special bricks used by
steel and glass makers, rose to 105.9 million euros ($148
million) last year, more than five times the level of 2009, as
revenue climbed 23 percent, RHI said in a statement.  RHI almost collapsed in 2001 as U.S. lawsuits for asbestos-
related damage claims exceeded its insurance cover and added to
an already high debt pile. It repaired its balance sheet over
the decade that followed by selling assets, starting bankruptcy
proceedings in the U.S. and paying back the debt it issued to
cover the asbestos costs.  RHI said it expects revenue to rise by about 5 percent this
year, driven by the division that makes supplies for glass
makers. In its steel segment, “the focus will lie on defending
existing market shares,” RHI said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
