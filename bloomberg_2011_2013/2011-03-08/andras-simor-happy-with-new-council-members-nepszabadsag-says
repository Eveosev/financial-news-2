Hungarian central bank President
Andras Simor is confident the recently nominated members of the
Monetary Council will act in accordance with central bank law
and the constitution,  Nepszabadsag  reported, citing an
interview.  “I find it hard to imagine that the members will not act
according to these,” Simor told the newspaper.  Ferenc Gerhardt and Andrea Bartfai-Mager, both of whom
worked in the central bank under former President Zsigmond Jarai, were sworn in as rate-setters yesterday after being
approved by lawmakers. The Economy Committee postponed
nominations for two other vacancies on the rate panel.  The new members will be able to adapt to the bank’s
environment given their earlier career at the central bank and
this is “makes things easier,” Simor said, according to the
newspaper.  Simor expects relations between the central bank and the
government to remain strained “over the coming months,” he
told the newspaper.  The government has criticized the central bank for being
too slow to cut and then too quick to raise  interest rates ; it
stripped Simor of his right to nominate two of the four outside
members in the seven-member rate-setting panel and has cut his
salary by 75 percent, defying criticism from the European
Commission and the  European Central Bank .  The government’s budget plan, announced last week, may help
improve  Hungary ’s risk assessment, Simor said, adding that
concrete measures to cut spending are still missing, according
to Nepszabadsag.  Hungarian banks have sufficient capital to absorb losses
from bad loans, Simor told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
