Dam levels in  Chile  fell 32 percent
in February from a year earlier and remain below historic
levels, said Public Works Minister Hernan De Solminihac.  Reservoirs were 15 percent lower than in January this year,
De Solminihac told reporters today in Santiago. While levels
will continue to fall without significant rainfall, an end to
seasonal irrigation in north and central Chile could ease the
declines, he said.  Drought conditions caused by the La Nina weather pattern
have reduced levels in dams that power hydroelectric plants,
forcing generators to rely on more expensive fuels. Chile’s
government last month introduced conservation measures in an
attempt to avoid power rationing.  “La Nina conditions could last until May,” De Solminihac
said in an interview after a presentation today in Santiago.
“Water levels won’t get any better until it rains.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
