Swiss stocks advanced, led by the
nation’s banks, as oil fell for the first time in three days,
while investors awaited a report that may show German factory
orders rebounded in January.    UBS AG (UBSN)  gained 1.3 percent and Credit Suisse increased 1.5
percent.  Schulthess Group (SGRN) , the maker of washing machines and
heat pumps, rose 7.6 percent after 2010 profit beat analysts’
estimates.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies climbed 0.7 percent to 6,540.82 at 10:02 a.m.
in Zurich. The gauge has added 1.6 percent this year. The
broader Swiss Performance Index gained 0.7 percent.  Oil fell for the first time in three days as speculation
that fighting may subside in  Libya  eased concern that supply
cuts will spread through the Middle East.  In  Germany , factory orders, adjusted for seasonal swings
and inflation, climbed 2.5 percent from December, when they slid
3.4 percent, the Economy Ministry will probably say at 12 p.m.

18.19 Swiss francs. The shares have still fallen 3.9 percent

banks for reasons including their “resilient private banking
exposure,”  Kian Abouhossein , analyst at JPMorgan wrote in a
note to clients.    Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , the 121-year-old wealth manager,
gained 1.5 percent to 41.05 francs.  Schulthess surged 7.6 percent to 49.85 francs, the highest
price since April 2010. The Wolfhausen, Switzerland-based
