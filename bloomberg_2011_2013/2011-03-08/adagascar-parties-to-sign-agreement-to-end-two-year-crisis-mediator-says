Malagasy political parties will sign
an agreement tomorrow aimed at setting a timeline for new
elections and end a two-year crisis, said Leonardo Simao, a
mediator for the South African Development Community.   The final version of the roadmap will then be approved by
SADC before an official signing ceremony in the Indian Ocean
island nation, Simao told reporters today in Antananarivo, the
capital.   The agreement that recommends President Andry Rajoelina
stay as president of a transitional government has been rejected
by the country’s three main opposition groups. A previous draft
of the proposal called for elections to be held by November.  Madagascar, the world’s biggest vanilla producer, has been
in political and economic crisis since Rajoelina, then mayor of
the capital, ousted  Marc Ravalomanana  with the help of the
military in 2009, leading to the country’s suspension from SADC
and the  African Union  and foreign donors stopping aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
