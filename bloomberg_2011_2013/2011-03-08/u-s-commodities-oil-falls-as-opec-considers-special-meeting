Crude oil fell from a 29-month high
as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries discussed
whether to hold a special meeting amid escalating violence in  Libya , a member of the group.  Kuwait’s oil minister said OPEC members are considering
whether to convene an “urgent meeting.” Futures trimmed losses
as opponents of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  prepared to
recapture the town of Bin Jawad. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised oil-price forecasts.  “OPEC may schedule a meeting to discuss increasing
production,” said  Michael Lynch , the president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “The
OPEC news and signals that the U.S. may release some strategic
reserves is making some investors think twice about being
long.”  In other markets, hog futures surged to the highest since
at least 1986 on signs that demand for U.S. pork is climbing
amid tightening supplies. Wheat declined. The UBS Bloomberg
Constant Maturity Commodity Index fell 0.5 percent to 1,769.75.
Yesterday, the gauge rose to a record.  Oil futures for April delivery dropped 42 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $105.02 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Yesterday, the price closed at $105.44, the highest
settlement since Sept. 26, 2008.  Hogs  Hog futures for June settlement rose 2.2 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $1.01675 a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Earlier, the price reached $1.022, the highest for a most-active
contract since at least April 1986.  The price of hogs for immediate delivery to slaughterhouses
is up 18 percent this year, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . U.S. pork exports climbed 3.2 percent in 2010 to
4.2 billion pounds (1.9 million metric tons), government data
show. The dollar has dropped 11 percent since June 1 against a
basket of six major currencies, enhancing the appeal of U.S.
goods.  “The exports have been picking up dramatically, and the
cash-hog market has been moving quite a bit higher as well,”
said Kurtis Ward, the president of KIS Futures Inc. in  Oklahoma
City . “Because of the weaker dollar, the U.S. has become one of
the cheaper products available.”  Wheat  Wheat futures fell to a one-week low on speculation that a
winter storm in the U.S. Great Plains will improve topsoil
moisture and boost yields for crops suffering from months of
dryness.  Parts of  Kansas , the biggest winter-wheat grower, may get
as much as 9 inches (23 centimeters) of snow today, the  National
Weather Service   said . Areas of the state were in “severe”
drought as of March 1, University of Nebraska-Lincoln data show.  “They’re calling for moisture in the western Plains,”
said Louise Gartner, the owner of Spectrum Commodities in
Beavercreek,  Ohio . “It didn’t look like they got much
yesterday, but they’re looking for heavy snow in a lot of that
region today.”  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 21 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $7.7975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
