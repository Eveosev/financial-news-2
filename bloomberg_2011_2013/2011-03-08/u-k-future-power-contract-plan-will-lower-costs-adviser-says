Britain’s  plans  to write long-term
contracts for electricity from low-carbon generation will drive
down costs for consumers, a U.K. government advisory body said.  The U.K., seeking to attract investment, is preparing
legislation that may include drawing up long-dated contracts
with utilities for generation from sources such as wind farms
and nuclear plants. This would set a fixed price for each
megawatt produced, providing revenue certainty. There are also
plans to enforce a carbon-dioxide emissions standard on fossil-
fueled generation.  “Basing the new arrangements on long-term contracts for
low carbon capacity or generation would provide more certainty
for investors, and drive down the cost to consumers,” the
 Committee on Climate Change  said in an e-mailed response to the
government’s so-called electricity market reform. The deadline
for comments on the document is March 10.  The government proposed setting a so-called emissions
performance standard at two levels. The first was at 600 grams
of carbon dioxide for every kilowatt hour produced, which would
be consistent with emissions for a coal-fed power station
testing CO2 capture equipment. The second was at 450 grams, with
coal plants testing CO2 capture being exempt.  Investors in low-carbon technologies may be further
incentivized should the government tighten its performance
standard, the Committee, responsible for raising Britain’s
emissions-cutting ambitions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by
2050, the committee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
