Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned  West Bank  settlers against reacting violently
to the dismantling of illegal outposts.  “The one who decides the law in the state of  Israel  is the
justice system and its authorized bodies,” Netanyahu said today
on a tour of Israel’s Jordan Valley, according to a text message
from his office. “The idea of a ‘price tag’ is an unacceptable
concept,” he said, playing off settler jargon.  “Price tag” is an expression used by some West Bank
settlers to describe the potentially violent reactions against
Palestinian property in response to efforts by the government to
limit or evacuate unauthorized Jewish homes and communities.  Israeli police and soldiers clashed with settlers when they
evacuated an unauthorized West Bank outpost on Feb. 28. The
government said yesterday that by the end of 2011 it is planning
to demolish all illegal settler outposts built on private
Palestinian land.  The  Yesha Council  that represents West Bank settlers called
the government’s decision “an act of provocation that will only
serve to incite and anger, while serving no practical purpose in
bettering relations with our Arab neighbors,” according to an
e-mailed statement.  Israel has built about 120 settlements in the West Bank
since the late 1960s. Another 100 smaller settlements, which
Israel calls outposts, were built without government
authorization during the past decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
