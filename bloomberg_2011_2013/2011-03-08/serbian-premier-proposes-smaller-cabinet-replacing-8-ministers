Serbian Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  asked lawmakers to approve plans to reduce the number
of ministries in a government shuffle being proposed a year
before general elections.  Cvetkovic will assume the portfolio held by Finance
Minister  Diana Dragutinovic , the only Serbian woman to serve in
the post, while the Economy Ministry will be headed by deputy
Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric. The previous minister, Mladjan Dinkic, stepped down from the post last month after falling out
with the premier over policy, threatening early elections.  Cvetkovicâ€™s new cabinet, which needs parliamentary
approval, will have 17 ministries, down from 24, and 21 members
of the government. The government, the longest-serving since the
fall of  Slobodan Milosevic  in 2000, is struggling to stay in
power after clashing with Dinkic, the leader of the junior
coalition party G17 Plus.  Cvetkovic, 60, also announced his intention to replace the
energy, trade and agriculture ministers, merging and
reorganizing some portfolios. The premier proposed Dusan Petrovic, a former justice minister and top official of the
ruling  Democrats , to lead agriculture, trade and forestry.  Energy and mining, so far led by Petar Skundric of the
 Socialist Party , will be divided, with the two parts attached to
the Infrastructure and the Environment ministries, respectively.  The premier also proposed bringing back Verica Kalanovic,
who was in charge of the National Investment Plan until
resigning with Dinkic. She is to return as deputy prime
minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
