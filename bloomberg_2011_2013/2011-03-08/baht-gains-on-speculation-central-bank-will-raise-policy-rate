Thailand’s baht traded near its
strongest level in almost seven weeks on speculation the central
bank will boost borrowing costs to tame inflation, increasing
the yield premium over developed nations.  The Bank of Thailand may lift the one-day bond repurchase
rate by a quarter-percentage point to 2.5 percent tomorrow,
according to 14 of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Two
predict no change. The currency was little changed from
yesterday on speculation unrest in  Libya  and the Middle East
will reduce demand for higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  “The baht is trying to price in the rate-hike
expectation,” said Norawit Suparinayok, a foreign-exchange
trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “So, it’s possible the baht may
test the stronger side today. But uncertainties in the Middle
East may create more demand for the dollar as a safe haven.”  The baht traded at 30.44 against the greenback as of 8:25
a.m. in Bangkok compared with 30.43 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier touched 30.38, the strongest
level since Jan. 19. The currency may trade between 30.35 and
30.47 today, Norawit said.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, added 1.5 basis points to
2.725 percent. The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December
2015 held at 3.42 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  The Bank of  Thailand  raised the policy rate at its last
meeting on Jan. 12 by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent, compared
with near-zero rates in Japan and the U.S. Consumer prices rose
2.9 percent in February from a year earlier after gaining 3
percent the previous month, official data released on March 1
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
