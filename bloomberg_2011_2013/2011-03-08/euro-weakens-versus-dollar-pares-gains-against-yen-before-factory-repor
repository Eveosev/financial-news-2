The euro fell the most in two weeks
against the dollar as concern the region’s leaders won’t agree
on a solution to its debt crisis damped appetite for its assets.  The 17-nation currency retreated from almost the strongest
level in nine months against the yen. Financing costs rose as
Greece sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.3 billion) of treasury bills
a day after having its  credit rating  cut by Moody’s Investors
Service. The Norwegian krone declined against 15 of its 16 major
peers as oil fell for the first time in three days.  “It’s a combination of overextended speculative
positioning and renewed sovereign-debt jitters,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New
York. “The post-ECB rally has gone too far too fast and the
euro is coming back to the reality of still very uncertain
prospects for the peripheral economies.”  The shared currency declined 0.4 percent to $1.3907 at 2:16
p.m. in New York. It reached $1.4036 yesterday, the strongest
level since Nov. 8. It rose 0.1 percent to 114.94 yen after
touching 116 on March 4, the highest since May 14. The dollar
strengthened 0.5 percent to 82.64 yen.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against currencies including the euro and yen,
climbed for a second day, gaining 0.4 percent to 76.784.  Euro Summit  The euro, which has risen 3.9 percent against the dollar
this year, has struggled to extend its advance beyond $1.40 as
European Union leaders clashed about how to deal with the
sovereign-debt crisis that forced Ireland and  Greece  to seek
financial aid last year. The 27-nation EU intends to approve a
“comprehensive” package of measures at a March 24-25 summit in
a bid to calm bond markets.  “As we get closer to the results of the euro summit and
you have these concerns lingering and spreads widening, you have
these pent-up aggressions playing out,” said  Stephen Gallo ,
head of market analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange in  London .
“Being overweight euros is probably not the most prudent
decision.”  The yield on 10-year Greek debt jumped as much as 46 basis
points to the most since before the euro was created in 1999,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Greece sold the 26-week
bills today to yield 4.75 percent, up from 4.64 percent the last
time the securities were sold in February, the Athens-based
Public Debt Management Agency said.    Portugal  Notes  Portugal plans to sell up to 1 billion euros of September
2013 notes tomorrow, its second auction this year.  The euro climbed 1.2 percent in the past week, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, which track the
currencies of 10 developed nations, fueled by speculation that
the  European Central Bank  may raise interest rates as early as
next month to contain inflation.  “There are other issues than simply a more hawkish ECB,”
said  John McCarthy , director of  currency trading  at ING Groep NV
in New York. “The implication of higher rates is also there.
The last thing those countries need is higher interest rates.”    New Zealand ’s dollar advanced, halting a five-day loss, as a
technical indicator showed its recent declines may have been
excessive. The kiwi rebounded from the weakest level since
September against the yen as traders reduced their bets that the
central bank will cut  interest rates  at its meeting this week.  The  New Zealand dollar  rose to 74.03 U.S. cents from 73.69
in New York yesterday, after falling to 73.39 on March 4, the
weakest since Oct. 1. The kiwi gained to 61.22 yen from 60.60
yen yesterday, when it touched 60.35 yen, the weakest level
since Sept. 9.  Krone Falls  Norway’s krone depreciated by 0.6 percent to 5.5838 per
dollar and was little changed at 7.7630 against the euro.  Crude oil traded in New York fell 0.6 percent today as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries discussed the
possibility of boosting output, easing concern that supply
shortages may be prolonged. It reached $106.95 yesterday, the
most since September 2008.  The Swiss franc dropped 0.9 percent against the dollar, the
biggest drop of any major counterpart versus the greenback, to
93.48 centimes. The franc depreciated 0.5 percent against the
euro to 1.3007, and touched 1.3040, the weakest level since Feb.
16.  The pound reached a one-week low against the dollar and
snapped a four-day decline versus the euro. Retail sales dropped
0.4 percent from January, when they gained 2.3 percent, a report
from the  British Retail Consortium  and  KPMG  showed.  Bank of
England  policy makers will maintain the U.K. interest rate at
0.5 percent on March 10, according to all 61 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  Pound Weakness  The pound was 0.3 percent lower at $1.6158, after touching
$1.6126, the least since Feb. 28. It strengthened to 86.06 pence
per euro from 86.21 pence, after reaching 86.36 pence, the
weakest since Jan. 28.  Sterling may depreciate to $1.58, its weakest level since
January, should it fall below $1.61, according to Kathleen Brooks, London-based research director at Forex.com, part of
online currency trader Gain Capital. Sterling hasn’t traded at
$1.5800 or weaker since Jan. 16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “In the short term, there isn’t much that’s going to prop
up sterling,” Brooks said in a phone interview. “The recovery
might stall a bit. The growth outlook is sterling-negative.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
