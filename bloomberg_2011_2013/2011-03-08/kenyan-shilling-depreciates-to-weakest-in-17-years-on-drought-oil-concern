  Kenya ’s shilling depreciated to the
weakest level in 17 years after the nation’s weather service
said the world’s biggest exporter of black tea will receive
“below-normal” rainfall in the March to May long-rains season.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy slipped as
much as 1.1 percent to 83.87 per dollar, the weakest since March
1994, and traded 0.5 percent down at 83.43 at 3:15 p.m. in
Nairobi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It closed at
82.93 shillings yesterday.  The distribution of precipitation is expected to be
“generally poor” over most parts of the East African nation, the
Nairobi-based Kenya Meteorological Department said today. The
combination of surging global food prices and a lack of rainfall
pushed up inflation to 6.5 percent in February, the highest
since October 2009, in a country which derives about 25 percent
of its gross domestic product from agriculture.  “The local unit is under compounded pressure of drought,
payment of dividend and rising global fuel prices and it’s at a
snapping point, with indication of weakening further going
forward,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-based
KCB Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Oil declined for the first time in three days, retreating
from a 29-month high as members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries discussed whether to hold a special meeting
on a production increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
