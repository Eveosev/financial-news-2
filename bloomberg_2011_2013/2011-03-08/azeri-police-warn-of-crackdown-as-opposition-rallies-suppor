Azerbaijani police warned they will
crack down on anti-government protests after opposition leaders
began rallying support to stage demonstrations later this week.  “Protests unsanctioned by the executive authorities will
be resolutely thwarted by police,” the Interior Ministry said
in a statement published in newspapers in the oil-exporting
nation today.  Inspired by popular uprisings that drove out authoritarian
leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt , opposition youth groups in  Azerbaijan  have started a campaign on the Facebook Inc. social-
networking  website  to hold nationwide protests on March 11.  The main opposition party Musavat, or Equality, has also
said it will stage a rally in the capital Baku on March 12 even
though it is banned by the authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
