The cost to rebuild Christchurch
following last month’s 6.3-magnitude earthquake could exceed
Treasury Department estimates by as much as NZ$5 billion,
according to  Fletcher Building Ltd. (FBU)   Repairs could cost as much as NZ$20 billion, Fletcher’s
head of infrastructure, Mark Binns, said in an interview with  Radio New Zealand  today, citing his own informal estimate. New
Zealand’s Treasury forecast in a report published on March 6
that the earthquake could cost as much as NZ$15 billion and cut
economic growth by 1.5 percent this year.  “It’s very difficult for people to get a handle on that
number at the moment,” Binns said. “It’s going to take a
little while to work through.”  The severity of the damage from the Feb. 22 earthquake that
killed more than 160 people means a “significant margin of
error” in Treasury estimates, Binns said.  The government selected Fletcher Building,  New Zealand ’s
largest building materials supplier, to oversee the
reconstruction of Christchurch after a 7.0-magnitude temblor
struck the city in September. No one was killed in the earlier
quake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
