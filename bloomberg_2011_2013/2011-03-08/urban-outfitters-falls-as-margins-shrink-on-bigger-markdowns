  Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN) , operator of
the namesake and Anthropologie clothing chains, fell the most in
more than two years after saying profit margins shrank last
quarter.  Gross margin, or the percentage of sales after the cost of
goods sold, narrowed 2 percentage points to 39.7 percent in the
quarter ended Jan. 31, the Philadelphia-based company said
yesterday. Profit amounted to 45 cents a share, trailing the 52-
cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Glen Senk accelerated merchandise
markdowns last quarter to make way for new women’s fashions.
Urban Outfitters, which operates in the U.S.,  Canada  and  Europe ,
also faced rising shipping costs as more international customers
ordered clothes directly.  “We may experience a continued increase in markdown levels
until we successfully navigate the fashion shift,” Chief
Financial Officer Eric Artz said yesterday on a conference call.  Urban Outfitters declined $5.80, or 15 percent, to $32.19
at 9:50 a.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares had gained 7.6 percent in the past 12 months before
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
