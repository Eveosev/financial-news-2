European Commission President Jose Barroso comments on whether  Portugal  will seek a bailout from
the rescue system for euro nations with high budget deficits.
Barroso, who comes from Portugal, spoke to the European
Parliament today in Strasbourg, France.  The rescue system for euro-area countries includes the
 European Financial Stability Facility , the European Financial
Stabilization Mechanism and the  International Monetary Fund . The
commission is the 27-nation European Union’s executive arm.  “That’s a question for the Portuguese authorities. It’s a
sovereign question of Portugal.”  “The financial stability fund and the use of that fund,
and IMF assistance as well, have to be seen as a last resort.”  “If a country can avoid using that mechanism, it has to
because the mechanism has costs.”  Barroso added that these are “not just reputational
costs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
