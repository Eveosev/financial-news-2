European stocks erased gains as the
yield on 10-year Greek  government bonds  climbed to the highest
price since before the euro started in 1999.  National Bank of Greece SA, Greece’s biggest lender by
market capitalization, slid 3.8 percent. EFG Eurobank Ergasias
SA and Alpha Bank SA lost 4.4 percent and 3.9 percent,
respectively. Moody’s Investors Service yesterday downgraded
Greece’s government bond ratings to B1 from Ba1, and assigned a
negative outlook to the rating. The Greek market was closed for
a bank holiday yesterday.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was unchanged at
280.73 as of 12:40 p.m. in  London , after earlier increasing as
much as 0.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
