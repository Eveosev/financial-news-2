  Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
dropped, with the yield climbing to the highest level in nearly
10 months on speculation the government will have to raise rates
to attract investors. The dong was little changed.  The yield on the notes gained 2 basis points, to 11.836
percent, the highest since May 14, according to a daily fixing
price from banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.    Government bonds  are currently being offered with
negative real return which is making them unattractive,” Nguyen Thi Tuyet, head of research at Sacombank Securities Joint-Stock
Co., wrote in a report today. “With inflation very likely to
push higher in the coming months, we believe that sooner or
later the state treasury will have to raise yields.”  The dong traded at 20,868 per dollar as of 3:36 p.m. in
Hanoi, from 20,865 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the  reference rate  at
20,663 today, compared with 20,658 yesterday, its website showed.
The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side
of that rate.  The dong traded between 21,500 and 21,600 dong from 21,450
at money changers in Hanoi today, from 21,450 and 21,650
yesterday, according to a telephone-information service run by
the state-owned Vietnam Posts & Telecommunications.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editor: Alan Soughley  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
