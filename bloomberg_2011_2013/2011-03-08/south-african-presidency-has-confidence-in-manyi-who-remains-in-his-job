Collins Chabane, a minister in  South
Africa ’s Presidency, said he has confidence in government
spokesman Jimmy Manyi, who will remain in his position.  Manyi has the responsibility to “represent views and
decisions of government and not that of his own,” Chabane said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Chabane was referring to Manyi’s comments last year, made
while he was director general of the labor department, that
mixed-race people in South Africa were “over-represented” in
Western Cape province. Manyi has since apologised for the
comments, Chabane said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
