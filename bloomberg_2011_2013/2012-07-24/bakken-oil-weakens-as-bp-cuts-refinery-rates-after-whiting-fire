Bakken oil’s discount to West Texas
Intermediate oil weakened after BP Plc slowed production at its
Whiting refinery in  Indiana  following a fire in a coker late
yesterday.  The fire broke out in one of the unit’s three drums, said
two people, who declined to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak for the company. The fire resulted in the
reduction of crude runs at the plant, one of the people said.  Bakken oil’s discount to WTI widened $1.75 to $3 a barrel
at 2:06 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Western Canada Select’s discount was unchanged at $14
below WTI.  Syncrude’s premium was steady at $3 over WTI. Syncrude is a
synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in  Alberta  into
refinery-ready crude.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet increased 80 cents to $16.25 a barrel
over WTI. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
added 95 cents to $17.  Poseidon’s premium weakened 30 cents to $9 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon rose 15 cents to $8.50 over WTI. Mars
Blend lost 40 cents to $9.60 a barrel over the U.S. benchmark.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
decreased 10 cents to $11.85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
