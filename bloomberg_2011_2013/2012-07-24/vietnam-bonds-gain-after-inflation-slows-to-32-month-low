Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose for a
fourth day as the government reported the slowest inflation in
32 months. The dong was stable.  The yield on debt due 2017 dropped to the lowest level in
more than a week as the General Statistics Office in Hanoi said
that  consumer prices  climbed 5.35 percent in July from a year
earlier, after rising 6.9 percent in June. That is the slowest
pace since November 2009. Price increases have decelerated each
month after August 2011, official figures show.  The yield on benchmark five-year notes fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.88 percent, the lowest
level since July 12, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  With inflation slowing, “the primary movement of  interest
rates  and government bond yields is still downward,” Le Nguyet Anh, a research manager at Ho Chi Minh City-based ACB Securities
Co., wrote in a note dated yesterday. “If the low inflation
rate can be maintained through 2013, the government bond yield
is expected to decrease to 7.5 percent to 8 percent” across
maturities, she wrote.  The dong was unchanged at 20,853 per dollar as of 2:50 p.m.
in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central
bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828 today, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent
on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
