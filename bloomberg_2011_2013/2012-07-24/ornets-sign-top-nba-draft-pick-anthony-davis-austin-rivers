No. 1 draft pick  Anthony Davis 
agreed to a multiyear contract with the  New Orleans Hornets  as
the forward prepares to begin the London Olympics with the U.S.
basketball team.  The Hornets also agreed to a contract with guard Austin
Rivers, the 10th overall selection in June’s National Basketball
Association draft, the team said in a statement.  Contract terms weren’t disclosed. Davis will make $13.4
million over his first three seasons and Rivers $5.8 million,
according to the rookie salary scale set forth in the 2011
collective bargaining agreement between the NBA and its players.
First-round draft picks’ first two years are guaranteed, while
teams hold third-year and fourth-year options.  Davis, who helped lead the  University of Kentucky  to a
national championship as a freshman last season, led the nation
in blocks with 4.65 per game. He averaged 14.2 points and 10.4
rebounds per contest.  The 19-year-old Davis was among the final cuts on the U.S.
Olympic roster before being added to the team after  Blake Griffin  suffered a knee injury.  Rivers, 19, led the Duke Blue Devils with 15.5 points per
game last season, becoming the third freshman in school history
to do so.  To contact the reporter on this story:
