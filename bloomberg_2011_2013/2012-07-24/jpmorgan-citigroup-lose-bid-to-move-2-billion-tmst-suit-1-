Banks including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
and  Citigroup Inc. (C) , sued for $2 billion by Thornburg Mortgage
Inc. for allegedly helping it fail, lost a bid to move the case
from  bankruptcy court  to district court as a Maryland judge said
almost all the issues could be decided in bankruptcy court.  The trustee for what is now TMST Inc. accused the banks
last year of extracting more than $700 million of margin and
interest payments from the former Thornburg by making
“unjustified” margin calls. The banks, including  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) ,  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc  and UBS AG, or their
affiliates, said three of the 31 counts involved allegations of
breach of contract and fraudulent conveyance, which a bankruptcy
judge can’t rule on.  U.S. District Judge Benson Everett Legg told them yesterday
in a written order that the bankruptcy judge can still uncover
the facts and send his findings to a district judge, even if the
banks are right in arguing that “that the bankruptcy court
lacks final adjudicatory authority.”  JPMorgan was named in the TMST suit because it bought
assets from Bear Stearns Cos., a lender to Thornburg. Thornburg
was organized as a real-estate investment trust and mainly
invested in residential mortgage-backed securities  The bankruptcy case is Thornburg Mortgage Inc., 09-17787,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Maryland (Baltimore). The
lawsuit in bankruptcy court is Joel Sher v. JP Morgan, 11-ap-
00340, and the district court case is, 12-cv-00157.  To contact the reporter on this story:
