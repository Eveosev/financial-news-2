Oil options volatility fell after
underlying futures advanced on concern that tensions in the
 Middle East  could disrupt crude production and distribution.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 33.1 percent at 3:12 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 34.78 yesterday.  Crude oil for September delivery rose 36 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $88.50 a barrel on the Nymex, after
sliding 3.6 percent yesterday.  Futures rose as Iranian and European Union officials began
meeting in Istanbul today, trying to establish common ground for
another round of international talks on the Islamic Republic’s
nuclear program. “We cannot negotiate forever,” Israeli
Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman told reporters after meeting
European Union officials in Brussels today.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $80 puts, which fell 20 cents to 48 cents a barrel at
3:33 p.m. with 1,520 lots trading. September $110 calls were the
second-most active options, with 1,337 lots changing hands as
they declined 4 cents to 8 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 59 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 51
percent of the 135,762 contracts traded.  October $110 calls were the most actively traded options
yesterday, with 6,441 lots changing hands. They fell 23 cents to
38 cents a barrel. September $85 puts rose 94 cents to $1.87 on
volume of 5,854.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 43,823
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 41,617 lots and
December $120 calls with 39,325.  To contact the reporter on this story:
