Citadel Capital SAE (CCAP) , an Egyptian
private equity firm, canceled a $147.5 million sale of National
Petroleum Co. to  Sea Dragon Energy Inc. (SDX)  because of
“uncertainty” about the finalization of the deal.  The sale was called off without penalty to either side, the
Cairo-based company said in a filing to the Egyptian bourse
today. The agreement was reached “in light of uncertainty
regarding the date on which the acquisition could be completed
as well as on-going economic turbulence locally and
internationally,” it said in a separate e-mailed statement.  In January, Citadel said its unit Golden Crescent
Investments Ltd., had agreed to sell its stake in NPC to
Canada’s Sea Dragon. Financing for the deal, which was approved
by the buyer’s shareholders, was already arranged for, Sea
Dragon said in a separate statement.  Shares of Citadel Capital  retreated for the first time in
three days, losing 0.7 percent to 3.04 Egyptian pounds at 10:55
a.m. in Cairo. That values the firm at 2.51 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
