National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC  and
 First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , Abu Dhabi’s biggest and third-biggest
banks, reported a rise in second-quarter profit as they
increased lending in the  United Arab Emirates .  National Bank of Abu Dhabi posted a 2 percent gain in net
income to 1.05 billion dirhams ($285 million) from a year
earlier, meeting analysts’ estimates, while First Gulf Bank
posted a better-than-expected 14 percent jump to 1.02 billion
dirhams, the banks said in separate statements today.  U.A.E. banks are recovering after the global financial
crisis slowed lending, hurt investment banking revenue and led
to an increase in bad loans. Lending by U.A.E.’s banks,
excluding provisions, rose 0.3 percent in the five months
through May, while customer deposits increased 5.2 percent,
according to data from the country’s central bank.  Abu Dhabi  Commercial Bank PJSC, Abu Dhabi’s second-largest
lender, reported a 45 percent fall in net income to 733 million
dirhams as a gain from the sale of its stake in Malaysian bank
RHB Capital Berhad last year wasn’t repeated.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi reported a 2.1 percent rise in
lending in the six months through June from December. Abu Dhabi
Commercial Bank said lending fell 1 percent, while First Gulf
Bank’s loan book expanded 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
