Taiwan’s dollar fell to the weakest
level in more than six months after data showed factory output
fell in June.  Government bonds  were little changed.  Industrial production dropped 2.44 percent last month from
a year earlier, following a 0.21 percent decline in May,
official data showed yesterday.  Asian stocks  dropped for a third
day after Moody’s Investors Service cut credit-rating outlooks
for Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to negative.  “The question is whether the global economy will slip into
recession again,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-exchange trader
at  Union Bank of Taiwan. (2838)  “The currency’s depreciating trend
will only continue under this environment.”  The  Taiwan dollar  slipped 0.1 percent to NT$30.116 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc, after
touching NT$30.150 earlier, the weakest level since Jan. 10. It
will fall to NT$30.200 within a month, according to Tong.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, climbed 26 basis points, or 0.26
percentage point, to 3.7 percent.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 was
little changed at 1.14 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The  overnight money-market rate  was steady at 0.392
percent, after touching 0.389 percent yesterday, the lowest
level since August, according to a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
