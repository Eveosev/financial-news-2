Recent excess rains and hail in
southern  Russia  have “amplified production risks” for the
country’s crops after some areas suffered from heat and dryness
earlier in the season, said Oil World, an oilseeds researcher.  Russia’s total grain crop may fall below 80 million to 85
million metric tons in the 2012-13 season, compared with 94.2
million tons a year earlier, the Hamburg-based researcher said
today in an e-mailed report. The country’s  export  potential in
the year that started July 1 may be 16 million tons, down from
28 million tons in 2011-12, Oil World said.  “Given the prospective decline of grain production in the
major growing regions of southern Russia, a large part of this
season’s export supplies will have to be sourced from remote
areas,” Oil World said. Logistical expenses may hinder the
country’s competitiveness on the world market, it said.  Rains may have improved the prospects of corn and sunflower
crops in Ukraine, while coming mostly too late to boost wheat
and barley crops, Oil World said. Wet weather also has raised
concern about the quality of the country’s rapeseed crop.  As of July 17, Ukraine had harvested rapeseed on about
356,000 hectares (880,000 acres), with production totaling about
762,000 tons and yields of 2.14 tons per hectare, Oil World
said.  “Even though the 2012-13 Ukrainian rapeseed crop is going
to exceed our original forecast, it will still fall short of
last year’s production and will be the smallest in five years,”
Oil World said. “Rapeseed production has been on the decline
since 2008-09, mainly owing to the elevated weather-related
risks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
