Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer
controlled by Chilean billionaire Jean-Paul Luksic, appointed
 Diego Hernandez , the former chief executive officer of Chile’s
state-owned Codelco, to run its mining division.  Hernandez, 63, will help Antofagasta “enhance its overall
growth profile,” Luksic said in a statement to the London Stock
Exchange today. Hernandez assumes his post Aug. 1.  Antofagasta, which operates four copper mines in Chile, is
seeking to overcome delays and declining output to boost copper
production by 9 percent to 700,000 metric tons this year. Copper
prices have tripled in the past decade on a growing shortage of
power cables and electrical wire in China.  Hernandez replaces Marcelo Awad who resigned on March 7
after delays in ramping up a copper processing plant at its
newest mine, Esperanza. Antofagasta, based in  London , cut its
2011 output forecast in June to 620,000 tons from 640,000.  The shares rose 1.8 percent to 1,045 pence at the close in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
