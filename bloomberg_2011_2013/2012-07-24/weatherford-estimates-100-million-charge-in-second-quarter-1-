Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT) , an
oilfield-services provider, estimated it would take a $100
million charge in the second quarter to settle allegations of
improper sales to nations with sanctions restricting trade.  The charge represents “management’s best estimate of a
potential settlement with the U.S. government related to its
investigation of alleged improper sales in certain sanctioned
countries,” the Geneva-based company said in a statement today.  The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating Weatherford’s participation in the
 United Nations ’ oil-for-food program, according to a March 15
federal filing. The U.S. is also investigating the company’s
compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the company
said. It pulled out of Cuba, Iran and  Sudan  in September 2007,
according to the filing.  Through the end of last year, Weatherford spent $40 million
to exit certain sanctioned countries and had $123 million in
legal and other fees related to the investigations, according to
the March filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
