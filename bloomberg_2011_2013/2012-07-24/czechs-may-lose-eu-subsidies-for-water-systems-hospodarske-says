The  Czech Republic  may lose as much
as 40 billion koruna ($1.9 billion) in European Union subsidies
for water system upgrades unless the government improves
oversight of the funds,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing
Jakub Kulisek, a deputy environment minister.  The European Commission may deny the country subsidies for
the years 2014-2020 because officials havenâ€™t been able to bring
control of the water industry under a single body, the main
Czech financial newspaper said.  Having the funds withheld would raise prices for water
consumers, the Prague paper said. Funding is regulated by
several ministries and should instead be brought under a single
institution such as the Czech energy regulator, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
