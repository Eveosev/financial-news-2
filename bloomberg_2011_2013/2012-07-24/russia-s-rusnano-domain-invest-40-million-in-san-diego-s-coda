Russian Nanotechnologies, the state-
run technology holding, and Domain Associates, a U.S. venture
fund, are investing about $40 million in San Diego-based
biopharmaceutical company CoDa Therapeutics.  The deal is the first joint investment between Domain
Associates and Rusnano, as the company is known, according to an
e-mailed press release. Domain is an investor in CoDa. Rusnano
will invest through a subsidiary.  Rusnano teamed up with Domain Associates in March to invest
$760 million in U.S. life science companies and build facilities
in  Russia . The companies plan to invest in about 20 U.S.-based
health-care technology companies involved in pharmaceuticals,
biotechnology and medical devices, the Moscow-based company said
in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
