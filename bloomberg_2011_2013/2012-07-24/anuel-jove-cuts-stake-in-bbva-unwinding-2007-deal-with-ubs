Manuel Jove, the Spanish real-estate
tycoon, cut his stake in  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBVA)  Argentaria SA as a
five-year-old agreement with  UBS AG (UBSN)  expired.  Jove, who sold his controlling interest in Fadesa
Inmobiliaria SA at the peak of Spain’s property boom, reduced
his holding in Spain’s second-largest bank to 2.99 percent, his
 investment company  said in a filing today. He previously owned
5.067 percent, making him BBVA’s biggest shareholder, stock-
market  records  show. He cut the stake by transferring 125.9
million shares to UBS as a deal from 2007 expired, the filing
said.  Jove said in 2007 he aimed to build a 5 percent stake in
BBVA in an agreement with Zurich-based UBS. By the end of
September of that year, when BBVA traded at 15.47 euros, he held
5.01 percent.  BBVA ended today at 4.43 euros, 77 percent below its
closing peak of 18.89 euros in February 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
