Rainstorms in  China  last week
destroyed crops in the provinces of  Inner Mongolia , Sichuan,
Gansu and Yunnan, the Shanghai Securities News reported, citing
Mao Liuxi, a deputy director of the China Meteorological
Administration’s Agricultural Meteorological Center.  About 9,000 hectares (22,239 acres) were destroyed in Inner
Mongolia, the newspaper  reported , without specifying the types
of crops. The province annually sows about 5.4 million hectares
of grains including corn, according to the China Agricultural
Yearbook.  About 3,000 hectares of crops were destroyed in Sichuan and
another 1,000 hectares each in Gansu and Yunnan provinces,
according to the newspaper. None of the three are significant
producers of corn, according to the yearbook published by the
Ministry of Agriculture.  Rainfall in the second half is forecast to exceed the
average of the past few years, increasing the risk of flooding
and threats to the autumn harvest, the newspaper reported,
citing Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu. The autumn grain
harvest accounts for 70 percent of the nation’s total grain
output, the newspaper reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
