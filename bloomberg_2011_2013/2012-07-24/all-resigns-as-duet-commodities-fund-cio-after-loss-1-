Tony Hall, chief investment officer
at Duet Commodities Fund Ltd., and portfolio manager Arno Pilz
resigned after losing money in nine of the past 10 months.  The fund remains open and the portfolio managers are in the
process of being replaced, Henry Gabay, co-chairman and co-
founder of Duet Asset Management Ltd., said today in a telephone
interview from  London . Hall and Pilz are still managing the fund
while Duet seeks replacements, he said. Hall declined to comment
when reached by phone today.  The Duet Commodities Fund  lost  11 percent since August 2011
and 6.4 percent this year through June, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Newedge Commodities Trading Index of
 hedge funds  invested in raw materials lost 1.8 percent this year
after gaining 1.1 percent in June.  “Market conditions have been especially tough for this
type of manager,” said Gabriel Garcin, a portfolio manager at
Europanel Research and Alternative Asset Management, a $550
million fund of hedge funds. “On the one hand you have pretty
strong buy signals particularly in the energy markets due to
political risks, and on the other you have a global economic
slowdown pushing down prices.”  BlueGold Capital Management LLP, the $1 billion energy
hedge fund co-founded by  Pierre Andurand , liquidated in April
after losing 34 percent in 2011.  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) 
said in May it would shut a $500 million commodities fund after
it lost almost 13 percent in the past four months. Billionaire
trader  John Arnold  told investors on May 2 he would close his
Centaurus Energy Fund.  Commodity Swings  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose
as much as 12 percent this year before slumping 13 percent in
May and rebounding 0.5 percent in June. The measure is down 2.7
percent since Dec. 30.  Brent crude , the benchmark for more than half the world’s
oil, has slid 3.8 percent in 2012 after reaching an almost four-
year high of $128.40 per barrel on March 1. U.S. natural gas has
gained 44 percent since falling to a 10-year low of $2.175 per
million British thermal units on April 20.  The Duet fund trades commodities from oil to metals after
starting in July 2010. It gained 26 percent in 2011.  Hall joined Duet to start the commodity fund after two
years as global head of distillates oil trading at the Credit
Suisse-Glencore alliance, which was dissolved in January 2011.
Before that he was global head of middle distillate oil trade at
Deutsche Bank AG between 2006 and 2008.  Pilz, who traded metals for UBS AG and Apollo Management
LP’s metals fund, heads Duet’s metals trading. The fund managed
as much as $350 million in March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
