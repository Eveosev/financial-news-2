Webasto AG,  Germany â€™s car-part
maker, will expand its production facilities in Slovakia,
 Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing a municipal official.  The company, which already employs 400 people in its
factory in Velky Meder, southern Slovakia, will spend about 5
million euros to expand production of car roofs, the newspaper
said, citing mayor Alexander Neveri. The expansion will add
about 470 jobs, Hospodarske said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
