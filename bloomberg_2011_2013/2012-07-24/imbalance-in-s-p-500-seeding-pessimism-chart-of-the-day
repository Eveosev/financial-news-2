Smaller U.S. companies are trailing
larger ones badly enough to help explain why stock investors are
increasingly pessimistic, according to  Pierre Lapointe , a global
macro strategist at Brockhouse & Cooper Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays a ratio of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Equal-Weighted Index, which doesn’t take into account
each company’s market value, to the  S&P 500 , which does.  The ratio peaked in May 2011 and has fallen 6.2 percent
since then. Yesterday’s reading was the lowest since February
2010, which showed the equal-weighted index failed to keep up
with a 22 percent gain for the S&P 500.  “Individual investors do not feel as rich” as the S&P
500’s performance would indicate, Lapointe and two colleagues
wrote in a July 20 report. This would have given investors a
reason for concern last week even though the index climbed to a
two-month high, the report said.  Only 22.2 percent of the respondents were bullish in the
latest weekly survey by the  American Association  of Individual
Investors. The percentage, reflecting the outlook for the next
six months, was the lowest since August 2010.  Consumers “starting to feel the pinch” of a slumping U.S.
economy may have even more to do with the prevailing view, the
Montreal-based strategist wrote. Growth slowed to a 1.4 percent
annual rate last quarter from the 1.9 percent pace three months
earlier, according to the average estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
