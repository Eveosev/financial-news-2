European Union regulators sent
antitrust complaints to 13 makers of optical disk drives used in
CD and DVD drives, according to an e-mailed statement today.  The European Commission said it suspects the companies of
colluding to rig bids over a five-year period for drives sold to
two manufacturers of the drives used in personal computers and
servers. It didnâ€™t name the companies involved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
