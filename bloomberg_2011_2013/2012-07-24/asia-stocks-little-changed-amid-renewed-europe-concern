Most Asian  stocks  fell after a
private survey showed  China ’s manufacturing may contract at a
slower pace this month and Moody’s Investors Service cut the
credit outlook for Germany. Declines deepened after reports on
French manufacturing and business confidence missed estimates.  Nintendo Co., a maker of video-game players that depends on
 Europe  for 34 percent of its sales, dropped 2.1 percent. Cnooc
Ltd. fell 4 percent in Hong Kong after China’s largest offshore
energy explorer agreed to pay $15.1 billion in cash to acquire
 Canada ’s Nexen Inc. China Railway Construction Corp. Ltd.,
builder of more than half of the nation’s rail links since 1949,
gained 3.8 percent in Hong Kong after signing new contracts.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.1 percent to 114.11 as
of 7:06 p.m. in  Tokyo , with about 11 stocks retreating for every
eight that rose. The gauge fell 2.8 percent in the past two
days, the most since June 4.  Hong Kong ’s market opening was
delayed due to a typhoon.  “The numbers are getting better,” said Cedric Ma, a Hong
Kong-based senior investment strategist at Convoy Asset
Management Ltd., which oversees the equivalent of $260 million.
“China is taking a more aggressive expansionary approach in the
second quarter. Some of the effects will be shown in the third
quarter, when we will see some signs of stabilization in
China.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 11 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern  China’s
economy  is slowing and Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will
worsen. The regional benchmark index traded at 11.6 times
 estimated earnings  as of yesterday, compared with 13.1 for the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 10.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nikkei, Kospi  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.2 percent as the
yen rose against most of its major counterparts even after
policy makers said they were watching its appreciation. South
Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  added 0.3 percent, and  Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index (AS51)  gained 0.1 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index
rose 0.2 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index gained 0.5 percent, heading
for its 16th gain in the last 20 days, amid a rally that trails
only  Denmark  among developed nations this year.  The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  climbed 2.3 percent to 22.7,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 6.5 percent in the
benchmark over the next 30 days. Gauges of anticipated price
movements for Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Korea’s Kospi 200 Index
were little changed after pacing Hong Kong’s more-than-20
percent rise yesterday.  Moody’s Downgrades  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
after rising as much as 0.1 percent today. The index fell 0.9
percent in  New York  yesterday as 10-year bond yields in Spain
and  Italy  surged, stoking fears the debt crisis will spread.  After the U.S. market closed, Moody’s said it cut  Germany ,
the Netherlands’ and Luxembourg’s Aaa credit rating outlooks to
negative, citing “rising uncertainty” about Europe’s debt
crisis. Risks that  Greece  may exit the 17-nation euro currency
and “increasing likelihood” of collective support for European
countries such as Spain and Italy were among reasons for the
change, Moody’s said yesterday.  “It’s going to take a lot longer to solve Europe,” said
Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1 billion at Platypus
Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “Equity markets are in a hurry
for a resolution, and I don’t think policy makers, politicians
and central banks in Europe can meet that expectation in a
realistic way.”  Exporters to Europe dropped. Nintendo declined 2.1 percent
to 8,280 yen.  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. (4902) , a Japanese maker of
photo films that gets 28 percent of its sales in Europe, slid
0.7 percent to 534 yen.  China Acquisitions  Shares of Cnooc fell 4 percent to HK$14.82 in Hong Kong
after announcing it will by Nexen in the biggest overseas
takeover by a Chinese company. China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.,
the Hong Kong listed unit of the coutnry’s biggest refiner, fell
0.6 percent to HK$6.84 after its parent agreed to spend $1.5
billion for a 49 percent stake in Talisman Energy Inc.’s U.K.
unit.  China’s manufacturing may contract at a slower pace in July
as the government’s stimulus starts to reverse the economy’s
slowdown. The 49.5 preliminary reading for a purchasing
managers’ index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics today compares with a final 48.2 for June. A number
above 50 indicates expansion.  China Railway Construction gained 3.8 percent to HK$6.80
after signing 20 billion  yuan  in new contracts. China Merchants
Holdings International Co., which operates container and cargo
terminals, advanced 1.5 percent to HK$24.15.  Hindustan Unilever  Among other stocks that gained,  Hindustan Unilever Ltd.
headed for a record in Mumbai after the unit of the world’s
second-largest consumer goods company reported profit doubled on
a one-time gain. The shares rose 7.5 percent to 476.2 rupees,
the highest since at least 1997, and the biggest gain on the
Asia-Pacific index. Volume was more than seven times the five-
day average, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  SK Telecom Co., the biggest South Korean wireless operator,
surged 6 percent to 141,000 won in  Seoul  after the company’s
decision to eliminate some handset subsidies prompted
speculation profit will increase. The company was the second-
best performer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index today.  Among the 1,007 companies listed on the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index, 148 are  scheduled  to report earnings this week, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings have  missed  analyst
estimates for 53 percent of the 68 companies listed on the index
that have reported quarterly results this month, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Billabong International Ltd. surged 20 percent to A$1.315
in Sydney after the surfwear maker got an offer from TPG Capital
