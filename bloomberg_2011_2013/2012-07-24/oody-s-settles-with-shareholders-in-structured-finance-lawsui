Moody’s Corp. (MCO)  said it reached a
settlement with stockholders in lawsuits filed over structured-
finance ratings.  Moody’s agreed to implement new governance procedures to
settle with the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System and other investors, according to a filing by the New
York-based company today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The ratings company didn’t admit wrongdoing.  The Louisiana pension plan sued Moody’s Chief Executive
Officer  Raymond McDaniel  and other officers in federal court in
Manhattan in 2008, saying they ruined the company’s reputation
by overstating grades for risky mortgage bonds. Moody’s, along
with competitor  Standard & Poor’s , were blamed for helping
inflate the housing bubble by both the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission and a Senate report last year.  None of the Moody’s executives agreed to pay investors any
money in the settlement, according to the filing. Lawyers for
the investors asked the court to approve $4.95 million in fees
and expenses.  The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. McDaniel, 08-09323, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
