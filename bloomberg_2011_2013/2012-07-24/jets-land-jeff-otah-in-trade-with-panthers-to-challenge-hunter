The  New York Jets  acquired offensive
lineman Jeff Otah, a former first-round draft pick who may
challenge Wayne Hunter for the starting right tackle job if he’s
fully recovered from a knee injury.  The Jets sent an undisclosed conditional draft choice to
the Carolina Panthers yesterday for the 6-foot-6, 340-pound Otah,
who has started all 29 games he’s played over his four seasons
in the  National Football League .  Otah, 26, has been limited to four games over the past two
years because of a left knee injury. He started four of the
Panthers’ first five games last season before being placed on
injured reserve on Oct. 19.  Otah started 13 games in 2009, when he was on the Panthers’
offensive line that helped DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart become the first teammates in NFL history to each rush
for more than 1,100 yards in the same season.  Hunter allowed 11 sacks in his first season as the Jets’
starting right tackle last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
