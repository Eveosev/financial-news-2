Israeli media misquoted comments
from the general secretary of  Iran ’s Olympic committee, saying
Iranian athletes will compete alongside Israelis at the London
2012 Olympics, the state-run  Fars  news agency reported.  The Israeli media “maliciously changed Bahram
Afsharzadeh’s words and sought to project comments from the
general secretary of Iran’s Olympic committee as they like,”
the report said.  “Afsharzadeh responded to journalists in the Olympic
village, saying Iran respects the spirit of sports and Iranian
sportsmen would not boycott matches because of the nationality
of most participants,” Fars said, adding that Afsharzadeh
hadn’t named  Israel .  Iran doesn’t recognize Israel. Iranian athletes withdrew
from events at the 2004 and 2008 games when paired against
Israel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
