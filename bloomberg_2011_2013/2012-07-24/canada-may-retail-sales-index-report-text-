The following is the text of
 Canada ’s retail sales report for May as released by
 Statistics Canada .  Retail sales rose 0.3% to $38.9 billion in May. Gains were
reported in 6 of 11 subsectors, representing 53% of retail trade.
Overall, retail sales have been relatively flat since November
2011.  In volume terms, retail sales rose 0.7%.  Food and beverage store receipts rose 1.6% in May.
Supermarkets and other grocery stores (+1.8%) led the sales
increase, the first rise in five months. Sales in this store
type have been relatively flat since the beginning of 2011, as
general merchandise stores have continued to gain market share
in food sales.  Sales at general merchandise stores increased 0.8%,
partially reflecting stronger sales of food. A 0.7% rise in
sales at department stores did not offset April’s decline. The
“other general merchandise stores” industry (+0.8%) advanced for
a seventh consecutive month.  Clothing and clothing accessories stores reported a 1.6%
gain in May. Higher sales at clothing stores accounted for most
of the increase, advancing for a seventh time in eight months.  Sporting goods, hobby, book and music store sales rose 1.9%,
partially offsetting the decrease in April.  Sales at gasoline stations declined 1.4% in May, reflecting
lower prices at the pump.  Motor vehicle and parts dealers registered a 0.4% decrease.
Lower sales at new car dealers (-0.2%) and automotive parts,
accessories and tire stores (-2.2%) accounted for most of the
decline.  Sales at new car dealers were down for a third time in four
months. Despite recent declines, year-to-date sales in 2012 for
this industry were 9.5% above the same period in 2011.  Electronics and appliance store sales declined 0.8% in May.
Sales in this subsector have been on a downward trend since the
end of 2011.  Sales increase most in Alberta  Retail sales rose in six provinces in May. Alberta (+1.3%)
reported the largest increase in dollar terms, with widespread
gains across store types. This was the seventh monthly sales
gain in 10 months for this province.  The 0.2% rise in sales in Ontario did not offset the 1.1%
decline in April.  Continuing an upward trend, retail sales in Saskatchewan
(+2.0%) registered a fourth consecutive monthly gain.  Quebec  (-0.4%) and  New Brunswick  (-1.3%) both reported a
fourth decline in five months.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
