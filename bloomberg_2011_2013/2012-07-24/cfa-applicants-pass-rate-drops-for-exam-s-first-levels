A lower percentage of hopefuls for
the Chartered Financial Analyst designation passed the first and
second levels of their three-part exam in June compared with a
year earlier.  Thirty-eight percent of applicants passed the first test,
the  CFA Institute  said today, down from 39 percent on the June
2011 exam. Forty-two percent of applicants passed the second
level, compared with 43 percent a year earlier.  The number of people who enrolled to take the exams in June
jumped 27 percent in the last four years as candidates seek a
hiring edge amid job cuts in the financial industry.  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  are all
seeking to reduce costs and staff in investment-banking units
after a slowdown in trading and merger volume.  Candidates can take the Level 1 exam in both June and
December, unlike the two latter levels, which are available once
a year. Thirty-eight percent of candidates passed the Level 1
exam in December 2011. Level 3 results will be released on Aug.
7.  Almost 150,000 candidates from 169 countries registered to
take the tests in June, the organization said in May.  Applicants seek the certification in the hope it will lead
to better jobs, higher salaries and a deeper understanding of
finance. Successful charter recipients spend an average of 300
hours preparing for each exam and typically take four years to
complete all three tests, according to the not-for-profit
institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
