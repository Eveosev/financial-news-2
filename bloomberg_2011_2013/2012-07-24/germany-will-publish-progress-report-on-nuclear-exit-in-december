Germany  plans to publish in December
a report to monitor progress on its plan to phase out nuclear-
energy generation and power a greater share of Europe’s biggest
economy from clean-energy.  The economy and environment ministries will publish a more
detailed progress report on the energy switch every three years
starting in 2014 in a bid “to readjust if necessary” the
program, according to a government  reply  to questions from the
opposition  Social Democratic Party .  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government has decided to shift
energy demand away from nuclear power after the accident in
Japan last year. Germany plans to shut its remaining nine
reactors by 2022 and raise the share of renewables to at least
35 percent of the power mix by 2020. It’s the biggest overhaul
of the nation’s energy infrastructure since World War II.  To contact the reporter on this story:
