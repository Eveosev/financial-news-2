Aeterna Zentaris Inc. (AEZ)  rose the most
in almost three weeks after the biotech company said it would
ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to fast-track the
approval process for its proposed test to diagnose growth
hormone deficiency.  Aeterna, based in  Quebec City , jumped 7 percent to 46
Canadian cents by 4 p.m. in Toronto, its largest single-day gain
since July 5.  The FDA is due to respond to the request within 60 days,
Aeterna said today in a statement. Aeterna expects to complete
its submission for the AEZS-130 diagnostic test in the first
quarter of 2013 if the FDA grants fast-track status, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
