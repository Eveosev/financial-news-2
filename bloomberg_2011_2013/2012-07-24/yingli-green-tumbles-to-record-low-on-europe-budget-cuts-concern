Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , the
world’s sixth-largest silicon-based solar module producer, sank
to the lowest level on record in  New York  on speculation
austerity measures in Europe will cut budgets for solar makers.  Yingli’s American depositary receipts tumbled 11 percent to
$2.04 at 2:25 p.m., the lowest level since the company’s initial
public offering in June 2007.  Italy’s solar market faces “disaster” as a new budget for
solar incentives may be reduced to less than half of the
intended amount, “significantly” reducing the outlook for the
nation’s installations over the next three years, DigiTimes
 reported , citing IMS Research. Tempe, Arizona-based  First Solar
Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest maker of thin-film solar panels, may fall
below $10 per share from yesterday’s $14.22 due to narrower
margin and further plant closings, Cowen & Co LLC said.  “It’s a very competitive game in the solar space right
now, definitely a lot of headwinds there,” Chris Kettenmann,
chief energy strategist at Phoenix Partners Group said by phone
today from New York. “You are going to see a lot of
consolidation before the oversupplies in the industry improve.
Austerity measures in  Europe  have aggravated the situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
