TomTom NV (TOM2) ,  Europe ’s largest maker of
portable navigation devices, rose the most in six weeks in
Amsterdam trading after sticking to its sales forecast and
signing a supply deal with French automaker  PSA Peugeot Citroen. (UG)   TomTom gained as much as 11 percent to 3.30 euros at 10:52
a.m., the biggest intraday gain since June 12. The stock has
risen 8 percent this year, valuing the company at 731 million
euros ($886 million).  Revenue this year will total about 1.1 billion euros, and
earnings per share will amount to 35 cents, Amsterdam-based
TomTom said today in a statement, reiterating a forecast from
April. The Dutch company will provide Paris-based Peugeot,
Europe’s second-biggest carmaker, with location and navigation
technology for its vehicles’ entertainment systems, TomTom said
in a separate statement.  “The contract win confirms TomTom’s strong position in
European in-dash navigation market,” and the company reaffirmed
its forecasts “despite weak consumer markets,” Niels de Zwart,
an Amsterdam-based analyst at  ING Groep NV (INGA)  with a “hold”
recommendation on the stock, said in a note today.  Second-quarter net income amounted to 8.9 million euros,
beating the average analyst estimate of 6.4 million euros.  Last month, TomTom signed a global agreement with  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  for the use of digital maps in new mobile services. Revenue
from that deal will start to come through next year, Chief
Executive Officer Harold Goddijn today said on a conference
call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
