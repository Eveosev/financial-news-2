Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) , the U.K.’s
second-largest pay-television company, reported a 4.2 percent
gain in second-quarter sales as more customers signed up for its
high-speed Internet offering.  Revenue was 1.03 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) in the
quarter, the company said in a statement today. The average
estimate of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for 1.02
billion pounds.  Virgin Media, based in Hook, England, is increasing its
Internet speeds for customers as competitors such as  BT Group
Plc (BT/A)  and  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  roll out fiber-optic
cables and market discounted bundles of TV, Internet and phone
services. Virgin added 459,800 customers for its fastest
broadband services in the quarter, giving it 1.3 million
customers, more than three times the number a year ago, the
company said.  Revenue for the first half grew 3.3 percent, helped by the
company’s advertising campaign with Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. In April, the company credited the ads, featuring Bolt
dressed up as Virgin Group Ltd. founder  Richard Branson , with
helping it gain the most customers in two years even as it
pushed marketing spending up 49 percent.  Virgin this year began to double the broadband speeds of
more than four million clients to increase customer retention
and encourage users to sign up for more expensive service
packages.  Customer turnover, or churn, was 1.4 percent during the
quarter, the company said. That’s up from 1.2 percent in the
first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
