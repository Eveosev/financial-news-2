An estimate of future average
overnight borrowing costs in euros fell to a record low,
according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month Eonia overnight indexed swap fell as much
as 1.3 basis points to 8 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, and was 8.9 basis points at 9:15 a.m. in
 London . The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight indexed
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending transactions was set at
11.6 basis points yesterday from 11.5 on July 20.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars fell with
the three-month cross-currency basis swap at 47 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate from minus 48 yesterday.  Banks increased  overnight deposits  at the European Central
Bank yesterday for the first time in a week, lodging 356 billion
euros ($431 billion) with the Frankfurt-based ECB from 349
billion euros on July 20.  Three-month Euribor was set at a record low 0.442 percent
yesterday from 0.451 on July 20. Euribor is the rate  banks  say
they see each other lending in euros, according to the same
panel of banks that contribute to Eonia.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was 0.451 percent yesterday from 0.452 on
July 20, the lowest since Nov. 9. Libor is published by the
British Bankers’ Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
