Canadian Industry Minister Christian Paradis said his government’s review of  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s proposed
$15.1 billion agreement to buy  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  has begun.  “The proposed deal will be subject to a review,” Paradis
said today at an event in Montreal. “I made comments about this
yesterday. If I made comments, it’s because a review is
ongoing.”  Under Canadian law, Paradis has 45 days to make a decision
on the merger, and can extend that deadline by another 30 days
if more information is needed.  Paradis said the deal must be compliant with  Canada ’s
foreign-investment law, which lists six criteria for judging if
takeovers are in Canada’s interest, including the effect on
employment in Canada and the impact on Canada’s ability to
compete globally. The parties involved need to do their
“homework,” he said.  “There is a law in place with six criteria,” he said.
“It’s not up to the government to convince Canadians that there
is a net benefit but this is for the stakeholders to do.”  Cnooc and Nexen “have to be compliant with the law,
including our national security law,” Paradis said. “The
companies, the stakeholders will have to do their homework.”  Paradis declined to comment on when he first heard of the
proposed transaction. “There is a law in place. I can’t comment
further on the process.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
