Bonus payments to U.K. executives
should be frozen until they have either retired or left the
company, if proposals made by U.K. economist John Kay to reform
the U.K. equity markets are accepted, the  Daily Telegraph 
reported.  His report, commissioned by the government, calls for
bonuses to be in shares rather than cash, with tight
restrictions imposed on selling them, in a bid to restrict
short-term profit, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
