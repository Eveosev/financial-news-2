of 1 million barrels each in September, one more than August,
according to a loading plan obtained by Bloomberg News.  The nation will also export four shipments of Escravos,
three Erha and two Yoho, separate plans showed. Cargo sizes
range from 950,000 barrels to 985,000 barrels.  Shipping schedules of Amenam and Okono grades weren’t
