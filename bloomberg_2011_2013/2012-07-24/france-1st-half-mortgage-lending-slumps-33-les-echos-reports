French mortgage lending declined 33
percent in the first half compared to the same period in 2011,
 Les Echos  reported, citing a study by l’Observatoire Crédit
Logement/CSA.  The decline can be attributed to a collapse in demand, a
lack of government aid, and a reduction in lending as a result
of refinancing difficulties at banks, the newspaper said.  Mortgage lending by banks in  France  this year will fall 25
percent to 30 percent to 110 billion euros ($133 billion) to 120
billion euros from 160 billion euros in 2011, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
