JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  agreed to pay
$100 million to settle credit-card holder claims that the bank
increased their required minimum payments after promising a
fixed  interest rate .  The accord resolves a class action, or group lawsuit, filed
on behalf of 1 million cardholders pending in federal court in
San Francisco. The $100 million settlement fund represents about
one-half of the up-front transaction fees cardholders paid on
their credit card loans, lawyers for customers said in a court
filing yesterday.  A trial in the case was scheduled to begin this month,
according to the filing.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the settlement.  The case is In Re: Chase Bank USA, N.A. “Check Loan”
Contract Litigation, 09-2032, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
