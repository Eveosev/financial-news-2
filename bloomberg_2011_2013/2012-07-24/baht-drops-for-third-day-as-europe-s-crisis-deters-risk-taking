Thailand’s baht declined for a third
day as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen deterred risk
taking and damaged the nation’s export outlook.  A government report due tomorrow may show overseas sales
increased 4.5 percent in June from a year earlier, compared with
7.7 percent in May, based on the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg survey. The baht touched 32 yesterday, the
weakest level since August 2010, as Moody’s Investors Service
cut the credit-rating outlooks for  Germany , the Netherlands and
Luxembourg to negative.  “Risk sentiment is weak today on Europe,” said Disawat
Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “We
can also expect to see some demand from exporters as the current
level is a quite good level for them.”  The baht fell 0.1 percent to 31.79 per dollar as of 8:35
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, was unchanged at 5.02 percent.  The Bank of  Thailand  will leave its  benchmark interest rate 
at 3 percent tomorrow, according to all 13 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 dropped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.12 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
