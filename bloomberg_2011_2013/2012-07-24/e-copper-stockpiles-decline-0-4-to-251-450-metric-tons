Copper stockpiles in warehouses
monitored by the  London  Metal Exchange fell 0.4 percent to
251,450 metric tons, data from the bourse showed.  Stockpiles, which dropped for a second day, have declined
2.2 percent in July, according to LME data on Bloomberg. Copper
inventories monitored by the bourse fell 32 percent this year,
with stockpiles having dropped in every month apart from June.  Canceled warrants, or orders to remove the metal from LME
warehouses, have risen 91 percent in July to 53,225 tons,
according to daily exchange data. The bourse accounts for about
80 percent of industrial metal futures.  Deliverable copper stocks at the Shanghai Futures Exchange
have risen 15 percent since the start of July. Stockpiles are up
73 percent from the start of the year, according to  bourse data .
Overseas exchanges are prohibited from owning warehouses in the
Asian country.  China’s increased raw material usage from fiscal stimulus
will have to offset the stockbuilding in the first half of 2012
and the potential destocking in coming weeks, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said in a report e-mailed July 23.  “Taking these factors into account, we see scope for
support to copper prices later this year, but a major rally is
unlikely,” according to the report.  On the LME, copper prices are down 2.2 percent this year,
making it the second best performer among the six industrial
metals on the bourse after zinc. It rose 0.4 percent to $7,432 a
ton by 3 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
