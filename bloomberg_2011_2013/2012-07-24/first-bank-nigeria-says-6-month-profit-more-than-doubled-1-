First Bank of Nigeria Plc , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, said profit for
the six months through June more than doubled.  Net income surged to 46 billion naira ($285.9 million) from
20.5 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based lender said
today in an e-mailed statement. Revenue rose to 182.3 billion
naira from 145.1 billion naira, while net interest income
increased to 108.9 billion naira from 96.2 billion naira.  The period was made difficult by an uncertain global
economic outlook and declining oil prices for  Africa ’s top
producer amid tight liquidity and high  interest rates , Chief
Executive Officer Bisi Onasanya said in the statement.
“Notwithstanding these headwinds, we were able to moderate the
impact on our cost of funds,” he said.  First Bank is seeing increased earnings after Nigerian
regulatory reforms following a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009.
Loans to speculators in the local  capital market  and the oil
industry brought the West African nation’s financial system to
the verge of collapse. The central bank bailed out eight banks
and set up the Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria  to buy bad
debts from all lenders.  The bank’s annualized return on equity is 25 percent, “and
we believe we can sustain this by December,” Bayo Adelabu, the
Chief Financial Officer, said by phone from Lagos today. First
Bank also hopes to achieve a loan growth rate of 15 percent by
the end of the year, he said.  First Bank shares rose 0.5 percent to 11.86 naira by the
close. The stock has risen 33 percent this year, compared with
11.8 percent in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
