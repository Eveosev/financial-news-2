Natural-gas production from U.S.
shale deposits climbed to a record in May even as the number of
drilling rigs plunged amid decade-low prices.  Output in the lower 48 states rose 12 percent to a record
25.58 billion cubic a day from Oct. 1 to May 1, Energy
Department data show. The  gas-rig count  fell 45 percent to 518
last week from the October high of 936, according to Baker
Hughes Inc. Gas fell to $1.902 per million British thermal units
in April, the lowest intraday price since January 2002.  “It highlights the fact that production lags behind
drilling activity, it doesn’t turn on and off like a switch,”
said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in
 New York . “There is generally a lag of six to nine months
between changes in the rate of drilling and the changes in the
rate of production.”  Production data provided to Bloomberg is from a
presentation the Energy Department is scheduled make to Congress
on Aug. 1.  Shale-gas production in April accounted for 35 percent of
 total output  of 74.48 billion cubic feet a day in the lower 48
states, according to the department’s Energy Information
Administration monthly EIA-914 report on June 29. That’s up from
29 percent a year earlier.  Marcellus Shale  The biggest supply gain over the past year is from the
Marcellus shale in the Northeast, where vast reserves are being
untapped in close proximity to  New York City  and other major
U.S. urban areas. Output from the deposit in  Pennsylvania  and
 West Virginia  averaged 6.85 billion cubic feet a day in May,
more than double year-earlier levels, department data show.  The data is “a confirmation of the prolific production of
shale,” sustained in part by drilling efficiencies and the
sheer amount of gas obtained as a byproduct of reaching for oil
and other liquids, said Anthony Yuen, a strategist at Citigroup
Inc. in New York.  The number of rigs drilling for gas is the fewest since
August 1999, while the  oil-rig count  climbed to a record 1,427
in the week ended July 13, according to Baker Hughes data. The
number of oil rigs, which fell by 13 to 1,414 last week, is up
19 percent this year.  Gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
advanced 7 cents, or 2.3 percent, today to $3.187 per million
Btus, the highest settlement price since Dec. 17. Gas is up 6.6
percent this year, rebounding 68 percent since dropping to a 10-
year low in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
