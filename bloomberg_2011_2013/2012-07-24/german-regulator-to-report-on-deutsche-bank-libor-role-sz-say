Bafin, Germany’s financial markets
regulator, plans to submit a report on  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s role
in the Libor and Euribor manipulation affair, Sueddeutsche
Zeitung said in a preview of an article to appear today.  Deutsche Bank has demoted four employees as a result of the
case and two employees have left the bank, the newspaper said.
The report will focus on whether their superiors were aware of
any manipulation, SZ said.  Supervisory Board Chairman  Paul Achleitner  has stated
internally that Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain wasn’t
involved in any wrongdoing and will remain in his position, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
