Algeria seeks to increase the area
of farmland under irrigation to 1.6 million hectares (4 million
acres) by 2014 from 1.1 million hectares now, the  Agriculture
Ministry  wrote.  The plan also includes converting 50 percent of the area
that uses gravity-based irrigation, estimated at 557,300
hectares, to water-saving systems, the ministry wrote in a
 statement  on its website yesterday.  Algeria is Africa’s second-largest grain importer after
 Egypt  and the region’s third-biggest wheat grower, according to
data from the International Grains Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
