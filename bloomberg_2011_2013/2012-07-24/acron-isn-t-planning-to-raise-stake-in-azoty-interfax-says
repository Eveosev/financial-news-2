OAO Acron, a Russian fertilizer
producer, doesn’t plan to raise its stake in Azoty Tarnow,
 Poland ’s biggest chemical producer, Interfax reported, citing
Acron owner Viatcheslav Kantor.  Acron said it bought 12.03 percent of Azoty Tarnow last
week for 347 million zloty ($100 million). The Russian producer
controls 13.2 percent of the Polish company’s capital, Azoty
said yesterday. Acron offered to buy 66 percent of Azoty in May.  They will cooperate in different fields, Interfax said,
citing Kantor. Azoty will be able to buy phosphate concentrate
from Acron’s Oleniy Ruchey mine that starts this year, Interfax
said. Output may reach 1 million metric tons a year, it said.  Acron hasn’t decided when to sell its 2.7 percent stake in
OAO Uralkali, Kantor said, adding that the price should be
“high,” according to the Interfax report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
