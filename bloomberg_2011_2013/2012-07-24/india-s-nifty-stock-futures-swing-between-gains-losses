Indian stocks rose amid speculation
the government will revive its economic reform agenda after
gasoline prices were raised for the first time in two months.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR)  rose to a record after the unit of
the world’s second-largest consumer goods company reported net
income doubled.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s
biggest oil-refining complex, climbed for the first time in
three days. The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, added 0.2
percent to 16,918.08 at close.  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL)  increased gasoline prices by 1 percent to
68.48 rupees ($1.2) per liter.  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. (HPCL)  and
 Bharat Petroleum Corp. (BPCL)  follow Indian Oil’s action. The revision
would help the finances of state refiners, which are forced to
sell fuels at below-market rates. Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh 
is under pressure to bolster an economy growing at the weakest
pace in almost a decade as policy gridlock deters investment and
Europe’s debt crisis hampers exports.  “There is expectation the government will initiate reforms
in a calibrated fashion,” Vijai Mantri, managing director of
Pramerica Asset Managers Pvt., told Bloomberg UTV today. “If we
have iconic reforms like opening up of retail and aviation to
foreign investment, it creates more excitement in the minds of
foreign investor and has potential to change the country’s
rating from global agencies.”  India faces becoming the first BRIC country to lose its
investment grade rating, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings
said last month.  Hindustan Unilever jumped 7.5 percent to 476.2 rupees, its
highest-ever price, after first-quarter net income rose to 13.3
billion rupees from 6.27 billion rupees a year ago. The figure
includes a one-time gain of 6.07 billion rupees. The median of
25 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg News was a 6.96
billion-rupee profit.  Missing Estimates  ITC, which has the highest  weighting  in the Sensex, rose
0.3 percent to 250.3 rupees. Reliance rose 0.8 percent to 724.5.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , India’s third-largest software exporter, fell 3
percent to 345.9 rupees after reporting first-quarter profit
that missed estimates. Net income climbed 19 percent to 15.8
billion rupees in the June quarter. The median of 42 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was a 16 billion-rupee profit.  Five out of 11, or 45 percent, of companies on the Sensex
that have reported June-quarter results have missed analyst
estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with
30 percent in the March quarter and 47 percent three months
earlier, data show.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP)  fell 0.1 percent to 414.8 rupees.
The second-biggest steelmaker may post first-quarter profit of
10.9 billion rupees, up from 9.33 billion rupees a year ago,
according to the median of 15 analysts’ estimates.  VIX Falls  Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA)  increased 1.3 percent to 186 rupees. The
iron-ore miner may report net income of 9.34 billion rupees, up
from 8.41 billion rupees a year earlier, according to the median
estimate of 19 analysts.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the  S&P CNX Nifty (NIFTY)  Index, fell 9.1 percent to 16.97,
the most since June 18. The Nifty index gained 0.2 percent to
5,128.20 and its July futures settled at 5,135.95. The BSE-200
Index rose 0.3 percent. Combined volume on the nation’s top two
bourses was 696 million shares yesterday, 23 percent less than
the 12-month daily average of 900 million shares.  Overseas investors bought a net 3.22 billion rupees of
local stocks yesterday, the 16th day of net purchases, raising
total investment in Indian equities this year to $10.1 billion.
That’s the highest inflow in  Asia  this year and a record for the
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
