Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  may receive a fine this
year for price fixing in  Brazil  that is a third less than the
maximum expected by the cement maker.  Antitrust regulator Cade will probably issue a penalty of
20 percent of Holcim’s 2005 revenue in the country, according to
a person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified
because the process is private.  Holcim may receive a fine of as much as 30 percent of
Brazil revenue in that year, Roland Walker, a company spokesman,
said in an e-mail, declining to give the sales figure.  Cade is deciding whether to fine cement makers after
Brazil’s Justice Ministry said in November that companies set
prices and divided clients in an “elaborate cartel scheme.”
Brazil’s Economic Defense Secretariat recommended in November
that Cade fine six cement makers including Holcim,  Cimpor
Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA (CPR)  and Camargo Correa Cimentos SA.  Brazil accounts for 3 percent to 4 percent of revenue for
the Jona, Switzerland-based company, Ian Osburn, an analyst at
ING, wrote in a report last year. Holcim had sales of 18.5
billion Swiss francs ($18.6 billion) in 2005, and its proportion
of revenue from  Latin America  was similar to that in 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  If Brazil accounted for 4 percent of revenue in 2005, a
20 percent fine would be 148 million francs, while a 30 percent
fine would be 222 million francs.  The probability of Cade judging against the cement
companies is “close to 100 percent” and they will probably
appeal, a process which could take five to eight years, Paulo
Furquim de Azevedo, a Cade commissioner between 2005 and 2009,
said by phone July 20. In almost 70 percent of cases, Brazil’s
judiciary has confirmed Cade’s decisions, he said.  Aggravating Factor  As cement is important in economic terms for construction
and housing “this is a factor which aggravates the fine,” he
said. Holcim may also face a double fine because it has already
had a penalty for anti-competitive behavior in its Brazilian
aggregates business, he said.  Cade, which started its review in November, normally
reaches decisions within 18 months and will decide in a final
ruling whether Holcim should be considered a repeat offender,
Vanessa Motta, a spokeswoman, said by e-mail.  French cement-maker  Lafarge SA (LG)  paid 43 million Reais ($21.1
million) in 2007 to settle the case and is not on the list of
companies that could be fined.  Cade can’t provide information regarding evidence such as
dates, prices and certain business practices because of non-
disclosure commitments, Motta said.  The Holcim unit had capacity of 5.3 million tonnes of
cement and employed 2,131 people in 2011, according to the Swiss
company’s  annual report .  Chief Executive Officer Bernard Fontana has said he intends
to boost earnings by $1.6 billion by the end of 2014 while
keeping Holcim’s investment-grade rating. Holcim is contesting a
$400 million cartel charge dealt to two Indian units.  To contact the reporters on this story:
