The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development may loan 58.2 million euros ($70 million) to two
Romanian wind farms owned by  EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the world’s
third-largest wind energy company.  The money will be used to complete connections to the
national grid and for testing, Ina Coretchi, a spokeswoman for
the EBRD, said by e-mail. The 33-megawatt Sarichioi and 24-
megawatt Vutcani sites in eastern  Romania  started up this year.  Romania is expected to double wind energy production in
2012 thanks to government incentives, Ion Lungu, president of
the country’s Association of Electricity Suppliers, said in May.
A 60-day environmental review begun yesterday must be finished
before the deal is signed, according to an EBRD project summary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
