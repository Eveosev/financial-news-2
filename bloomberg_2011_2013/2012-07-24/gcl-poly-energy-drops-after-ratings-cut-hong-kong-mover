GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , the
biggest maker of polysilicon and solar wafers, tumbled to a
three-year low in Hong Kong trading following a ratings cut by
an analyst.  The stock fell as much as 6.9 percent and closed at
HK$1.23, down 6.1 percent to its lowest since May 2009. The
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  dropped 0.8 percent in comparison.  The rating was cut to reduce from neutral by Zhang Yi, a
Shanghai-based analyst at Phillip Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd.
“The rebound in price is difficult in the short term so its
revenue from major business may have been declining,” the
analyst said in a note today.  Every part of the solar supply chain is suffering from
oversupply and falling prices. The average spot price of
polysilicon sank to a decade low of $21.92 a kilogram as of July
9, a 56 percent decline from a year ago, according to Bloomberg
New Energy Finance data.  GCL-Poly, along with  LDK Solar Co. (LDK) ,  Daqo New Energy Corp. (DQ) 
and China Silicon Corp., filed complaints that led the Ministry
of Commerce to open an investigation last week on whether
polysilicon imports from the U.S. and  South Korea  were sold at a
loss.  The result of the probe is “uncertain and can’t reverse
investors’ negative speculation on the company’s earnings,”
Peter Sheng, an analyst of Guotai Junan Securities HK Ltd., said
by phone today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
