factories easing and as Moody’s downgraded Germany’s credit

“China is taking a more aggressive expansionary approach in the
second quarter. Some of the effects will be shown in the third
quarter, when we will see some signs of stabilization in
China.”  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 12 percent from this
year’s high in February through yesterday on signs  Europe ’s debt
crisis is worsening while growth slows in China and the U.S. The
drop cut the  value  of shares on the gauge to 10 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 10.6 for Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index advanced 0.5 percent to
