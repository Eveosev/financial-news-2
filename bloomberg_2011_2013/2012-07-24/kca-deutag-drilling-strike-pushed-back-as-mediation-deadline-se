A possible Norwegian strike by
offshore workers at KCA Deutag Drilling Ltd. was pushed back by
a month after a deadline for mediation was set for Sept. 1.  Industry Energy, a labor union, had said July 13 that 159
KCA employees at Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Ringhorne and  Statoil ASA (STL) ’s
Kvitebjoern installations would walk off the job if  Norway ’s Oil
Industry Association didn’t grant them the same conditions as
other drilling workers in the country.  A government-led mediation between the union and the
association will start Aug. 31 with a deadline of midnight the
following day, Industry Energy said today on its website. If the
parties don’t reach an agreement, a strike will begin at the two
sites, it said.  KCA workers didn’t participate in the recent energy
industry strike that disrupted Norwegian oil and gas production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
