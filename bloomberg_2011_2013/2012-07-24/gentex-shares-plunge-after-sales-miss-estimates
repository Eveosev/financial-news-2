Gentex Corp. (GNTX)  fell the most since it
started trading 26 years ago after the maker of rearview mirrors
missed analysts’ estimates and said changing customer
preferences will hurt profit for the next two years.  Gentex fell 29 percent to $15.01 a share at the close in
 New York  after earlier sliding 32 percent to $14.38, the biggest
intraday decline since Gentex shares started trading Jan. 8,
1986. The Zeeland, Michigan-based supplier had $280.3 million in
sales, according to a statement today, missing the $283 million
average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The maker of advanced-technology mirrors said that four
customers have decided to put rear-camera displays with the
radio in the center console of a vehicle, rather than in the
mirror. The decisions will have a negative impact on 2013 and
2014 results, Gentex said in the statement.  Gentex also forecast that third-quarter sales would be
about the same to 5 percent higher compared with 2011’s third
quarter. The company reported second-quarter net income of $40.8
million, or 28 cents a share. The average estimate of 11
analysts was for a profit of 29 cents.  The company’s gross profit margin declined to 33.1 percent
in the second quarter, down from 34.7 percent in this year’s
first quarter and 35.2 percent a year earlier. The slide was
because of annual price reductions and product mix, according to
the statement.  “We recognize that we have work to do to improve the gross
profit margin,” Chief Executive Officer Fred Bauer said in the
statement.  The company expects its third-quarter gross profit margin
will increase by about 0.5 percentage point from the second
quarter, according to today’s statement.  Gentex also said some customers are “reducing orders at
the last minute, making it increasingly difficult to forecast
with any degree of certainty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
