The  Cleveland Browns  and top draft
pick Trent Richardson agreed to a contract that will pay the
running back $20.4 million over four years,  ESPN reported ,
citing unidentified people familiar with the negotiations.  Richardson’s deal is fully guaranteed and includes a $13.3
million signing bonus, ESPN said. Browns spokesman Neal Gulkis
said in an e-mail that the team has yet to reach an agreement
with Richardson, who was the third overall pick in April’s
National Football League draft.  Richardson, who rushed for 1,679 yards and 21 touchdowns as
a junior at the University of Alabama last year, was the first
running back taken among the top three picks in the NFL draft
since  Reggie Bush  in 2006.  The Browns traded up one spot to draft Richardson, seeking
to improve a rushing attack that ranked  28th  out of 32 teams in
the NFL last season. Cleveland’s four rushing touchdowns were
the fewest in the league.  The Browns are also close to finalizing a contract with
their second first-round draft pick, quarterback  Brandon Weeden ,
 ESPN said . Weeden, the 22nd pick, would receive a four-year
contract worth about $8.1 million, according to ESPN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
