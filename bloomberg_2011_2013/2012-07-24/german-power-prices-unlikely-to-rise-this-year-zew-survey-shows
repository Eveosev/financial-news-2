Power prices in  Germany  are unlikely
to rise before the end of this year, according to a survey by
 ZEW, the Center for European Economic Research .  The ZEW Energy Market Barometer, the Mannheim-based
center’s twice-yearly survey of about 200 experts, showed that
some 140 respondents expect electricity prices to remain
unchanged until the end of 2012.  “This assessment is in line with the stable forecasts on
primary energy sources on the global markets,” Nikolas
Woelfing, a researcher at ZEW, said in a statement on the
institution’s website.  Some 150 of the participants in the survey predicted that
crude  oil prices  will remain stable through the end of 2012,
while 140 companies forecast natural gas will stay little
changed, the report showed. Manufacturers, commercial
enterprises, municipalities and other end-users can expect
prices to climb in the next five years, 190 respondents said.  German baseload 2013 electricity prices, for delivery
around the clock, have declined 10 percent this year to 47.80
euros ($57.89) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Participants in ZEW’s survey include energy experts from
academia and industry, including  energy supply , trading, and
service companies, regional suppliers, and electricity and
green-power companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
