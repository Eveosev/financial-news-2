Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  will increase
production of Lexus RX sports-utility vehicles at one of its
Canadian plants to counter the effects of a rising yen.  The company, Asia’s largest automaker, plans to invest
C$100 million ($98 million) and add about 400 jobs at its
Cambridge, Ontario, plant, according to a statement today. RX
capacity will rise by 30,000 vehicles annually to 104,000 by
2014, the Toyota City, Japan-based automaker said.  Toyota is headed for record vehicle production in  North
America  this year. Japanese automakers are moving more work from
 Japan  to North America because of the strong yen. The Japanese
currency has gained about 8.9 percent in the past three months
against nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation Weighted Indexes, the biggest increase in the group.  In March, Toyota announced plans to invest C$80 million  to
boost its RAV4 capacity by one-third at the Woodstock, Ontario,
facility. The factory’s RAV4 capacity will be raised to 200,000
annually in early 2013 from 150,000, Toyota said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
