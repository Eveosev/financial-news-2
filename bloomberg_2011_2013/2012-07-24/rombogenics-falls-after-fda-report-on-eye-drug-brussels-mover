ThromboGenics NV (THR)  fell as much as 19
percent after the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  said it had
concerns about the safety of the company’s eye drug.  The shares traded 8.8 percent lower at 22.83 euros as of
2:52 p.m in Brussels. The intraday decline is the steepest since
June 5.  Side effects including eye pain, perceived flashes of
light, blurred vision and impaired vision happened two to four
times more often in patients receiving ocriplasmin than those
getting a placebo in a trial, the FDA said in a  staff report 
today.  “These adverse events may be transient and cause no long
term harm to the retina,” the FDA said. “However, this
conclusion can not be made definitively based on the data
available.”  ThromboGenics, based near Leuven,  Belgium , is applying for
U.S. approval of the drug, which it proposed selling under the
brand name Jetrea, as a treatment for vitreomacular adhesion, a
condition where a gel inside the eye liquefies and eventually
collapses, leading to distorted vision, age- and diabetes-
related macular conditions and retinal tears. Injecting the drug
into the back of the eye can eliminate the need for expensive
and debilitating surgery in some patients.  An FDA advisory panel is scheduled to discuss the
application on July 26, and the agency is due to decide on the
application by Oct. 17.  Novartis AG (NOVN)  bought marketing rights for the drug outside
the U.S. in March in a deal worth as much as 375 million euros
($453 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
