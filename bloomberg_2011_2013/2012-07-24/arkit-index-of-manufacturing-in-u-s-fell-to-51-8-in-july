The Markit Economics preliminary
 index  of U.S. manufacturing decreased to 51.8 in July from 52.5
a month earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 in the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 12 economists was 52. Estimates ranged from 51 to 53.  The  European debt crisis  and slower growth in China and
 Brazil  threaten to limit demand for U.S. exports. At the same
time, American consumers are slowing their spending and
businesses are tempering equipment purchases.  Euro-area services and manufacturing shrank for a sixth
month in July, adding to signs of a deepening economic slump,
another Markit report showed today. A composite index based on a
survey of purchasing managers in both industries in the 17-
nation euro area held at 46.4, Markit said.  Regional U.S. manufacturing data for July have been mixed.
The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s general economic index
rose to 7.4 this month from 2.3 in June, showing expansion. The
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s economic  index  was minus
12.9 in July, the third month of contraction.  Markit’s preliminary purchasers figure is based on replies
from about 85 percent to 90 percent of those American
manufacturers who respond to the poll of the more than 600
companies surveyed.  The gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May. The company
surveys purchasing managers in more than 30 countries and
regions, including Europe and  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
