H. Lundbeck A/S (LUN)  and Les Laboratoires
Servier may be sent antitrust complaints by European Union
regulators this week over hampering the sale of generic versions
of branded drugs, Reuters reported.  Anders Schroll, a spokesman for Lundbeck in Copenhagen,
said the company hadn’t received any formal notification from EU
regulators.  Lucy Vincent, a spokeswoman for Servier, and Antoine
Colombani, a spokesman for the European Commission in Brussels,
didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
