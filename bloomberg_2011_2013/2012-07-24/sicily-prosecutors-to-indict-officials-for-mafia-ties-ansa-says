Prosecutors in Palermo, Sicily, will
seek the indictment of state officials for alleged ties to the
mafia in the 1990s, Italian news service Ansa reported without
saying where it got the information.  Prosecutors will submit to a judge the request to indict 12
people, including former ministers Nicola Mancino and Calogero
Mannino, police officers and mafia bosses, Ansa said.  Mancino was interior minister at the time of anti-mafia
prosecutor Paolo Borsellino’s assassination in 1992.  A spokesman for the prosecutors declined to comment on Ansa
report, when contacted by Bloomberg.  Italy’s president, Giorgio Napolitano, last week asked the
constitutional court to rule on the use of wiretaps between his
office and Mancino. Napolitano said the wiretapping “harmed the
prerogatives of the President as determined by the
Constitution,” according to a July 16 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
