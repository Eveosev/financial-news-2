Ukrainian steel production fell 4.3
percent in June from the previous month on slower Asian and
European demand, according to Delphica Project.  Output of the alloy slid to 2.79 million metric tons from
2.92 million tons in May, Pavlo Perkonos, chief analyst at the
Kiev-based researcher, said in an e-mailed comment today. Steel
production was 2.72 million tons in June 2011, according to
Delphica.  Steel exports from Ukraine in 2012â€™s first half declined
6.6 percent to 11.7 million tons from 12.5 million tons a year
earlier, Perkonos said. Ukraine exports more than 75 percent of
its steel production, according to Delphica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
