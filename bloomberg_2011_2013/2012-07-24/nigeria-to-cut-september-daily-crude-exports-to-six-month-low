Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to reduce daily crude exports for September to
the lowest in six months, according to shipping schedules
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will export 70 cargoes totaling 64.1 million
barrels, or 2.14 million barrels a day, the least since March,
loading plans showed.  The nation will ship 10 cargoes of Qua Iboe, eight Agbami,
six Akpo, six Forcados, five Bonga, five  Bonny Light , four Brass
River, four Escravos, four Usan, three Amenam, three Antan,
three Erha, two Abo, two Okono, two Yoho, one EA, one Okwori and
one Pennington, according to the schedules.  Exports in August were revised down to 77 cargoes, or 2.27
million barrels a day, after one Okono cargo was deferred to
September.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
