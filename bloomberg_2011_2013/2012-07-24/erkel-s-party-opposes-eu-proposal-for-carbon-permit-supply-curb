A European Union proposal to
postpone the sale of some emissions permits to prop up prices in
the carbon market is flawed, said Joachim Pfeiffer, the economic
policy spokesman for  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s party.  The EU proposal would push up energy and production costs,
hurting German industry even as it’s being asked to shoulder a
bigger burden in the euro crisis, and “must be prevented,”
Pfeiffer said in an e-mailed statement today. “ Europe  shouldn’t
lop off the branch it’s sitting on.”  EU carbon prices have fallen 47 percent in the past twelve
months to 7.20 euros ($8.67) a metric ton as the recession has
cut demand for permits from factories and power stations. The
bloc has a surplus of about 1.4 billion permits by the end of
the current 2008-2012 trading period, according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  The European Commission wants to temporarily delay the sale
of some number of permits to prop up prices, a process known as
backloading. The commission said on July 20 it would propose a
procedure to allow it to postpone auctions of allowances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
