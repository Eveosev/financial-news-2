(Corrects to say that business confidence is at lowest
since early 2010 in second paragraph and corrects reference to
sentiment in third graph.)  French  business confidence  fell in
July, underlying the likelihood of both foreign and domestic
demand falling,  France ’s national statistics institute said.  Sentiment among French factory executives fell to 90, the
lowest since early 2010, from a revised 91 in June, Insee said
in an e-mailed statement from Paris today. Economists expected a
reading of 92, according to the median of 16 estimates gathered
by Bloomberg News.  With neighbors such as Spain and Italy already in a
recession and  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis weighing on global
growth, French executives say their order books are low, Insee
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
