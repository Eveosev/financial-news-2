Altria Group Inc. (MO) , the largest
seller of tobacco in the U.S., reported second-quarter profit
that beat analysts’  estimates , helped by higher cigarette
prices.  Net income rose to $1.23 billion, or 60 cents a share, from
$444 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier, the Richmond,
Virginia-based maker of Marlboro cigarettes said today in a
statement. Excluding items, such as Altria’s investment in
SABMiller, profit totaled 59 cents. Analysts projected 57 cents,
the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Altria’s Philip Morris USA business raised prices on all
cigarette brands by 6 cents a pack last month, the third
increase in the past year. New packaging for Marlboro and last
year’s introduction of a new variety, Marlboro Black, boosted
the company’s share of U.S. smokers.  It was “a solid quarter as Marlboro brand building drives
share gains,” Bonnie Herzog, an analyst with  Wells Fargo & Co .
in  New York , wrote today in a note. She rates Altria shares
outperform, the equivalent of a buy. “Higher list prices and
effective cost management” boosted profitability, she said.  Altria said its market share advanced 0.8 percentage point
to 50.1 percent. Operating margin for the cigarette unit widened
0.6 point to 41.4 percent  Altria rose 0.2 percent to $35.57 at the close in New York.
The shares have advanced 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
