South Africa’s corn harvest is
forecast to climb 7 percent this year after planting increased,
the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said.  Production is estimated to rise to 11.7 million metric tons
from 10.9 million tons in 2011, the FAO wrote in a country
 report  on its website dated yesterday. Corn exports are expected
to fall in 2012-13 because of low stockpiles.  South Africa is the largest corn producer and exporter on
the African continent, and shipments rose 20 percent to an
estimated 2.4 million tons in the year through April, according
to the Rome-based FAO. The jump in exports depleted stocks and
prompted the country to import 420,000 tons of the grain.  “During the beginning of July 2012 domestic prices of
maize increased sharply, buoyed by escalating international
prices,” the FAO wrote, using another name for corn. “The
comparatively tight supply situation in  South Africa  for 2012-13
marketing year compared to the previous year has also
contributed to maintaining prices at high levels.”  Recent domestic price gains for corn follow a decline from
record levels in January on the outlook for a larger 2012 crop,
according to the FAO. Prices for the commodity have surged more
than 50 percent in  Chicago  since mid-June after drought in the
U.S. Midwest cut yield potential in the world’s largest
producer.  Exports in 2011-12 included 1.1 million tons of corn
shipped to  Mexico , while surpluses in Malawi and Zambia limited
regional export opportunities for South Africa, the FAO wrote.
Shipments to southern African countries fell 18 percent to about
520,000 tons in 2011-12, and mainly went to Botswana,  Lesotho ,
 Namibia  and  Swaziland , according to the report.  Favorable Harvests  “There was a notable decline in exports to neighboring
southern African countries following the generally favorable
harvests in several countries and the consequent reduction in
import demand,” the FAO wrote.  South African wheat production is forecast to slide 20
percent this year to 1.62 million tons from 2.01 million tons
after farmers planted less and because of dry weather and low
soil moisture at the start of the planting period in Free State
province, the main growing region, according to the UN agency.  “The reduction in planted area to wheat follows the
comparatively low domestic prices in 2012,” the FAO wrote.  The wheat area is forecast to slide 10 percent to 547,200
hectares (1.35 million acres), it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
