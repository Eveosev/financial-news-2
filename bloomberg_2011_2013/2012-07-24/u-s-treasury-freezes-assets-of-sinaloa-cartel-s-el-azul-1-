The Treasury Department said it’s
freezing U.S. assets controlled by Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno,
a leader of  Mexico ’s violent Sinaloa drug cartel known as “El
Azul.”  Esparragoza has used profits from narcotics trafficking to
build a business empire that includes a housing development,
shopping mall, gas stations and an industrial park, operated by
friends and family, Treasury said today in an e-mailed
statement. The action taken today prohibits people in the U.S.
from engaging in financial transactions with his businesses,
Treasury said.  “Esparragoza Moreno has purposely kept a low profile in
hopes of avoiding scrutiny while he has increased his influence
and ill-gotten gains,” Adam J. Szubin, director of Treasury’s
Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in the statement.
“Today’s action shines the spotlight on this godfather of
Mexican narcotics whether he likes it or not.”  More than 47,000 people have died in drug-related violence
since Mexican President  Felipe Calderon  declared war on the
cartels in 2006. The government estimates that the drug war
shaves about 1 percentage points off economic output annually.  Esparragoza is wanted in both Mexico and the U.S., and
today’s action targets six of his family members, including four
children, Treasury said. The U.S. State Department is offering a
reward of as much as $5 million for information leading to his
arrest, while Mexican authorities are offering 30 million pesos
($2.18 million), Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
