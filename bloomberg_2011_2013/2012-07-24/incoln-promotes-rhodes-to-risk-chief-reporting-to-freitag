Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) , the insurer
that repaid a $950 million bailout, promoted John Rhodes to
chief risk officer.  Rhodes, 40, will remain head of equity risk management and
will report to Chief Financial Officer Randal Freitag, the
Radnor, Pennsylvania-based insurer said today in a statement.
Freitag held the risk post before becoming CFO, said Michael
Arcaro, a spokesman for the company.  Rhodes is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and was an
officer in the Navy’s nuclear propulsion program. He has a
master’s degree in business from  New York  University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
