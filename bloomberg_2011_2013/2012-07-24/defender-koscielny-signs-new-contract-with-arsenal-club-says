Laurent Koscielny has signed a new
long term contract with English Premier League soccer team
Arsenal, the club said today.  Arsenal didn’t disclose the length or financial terms of
the agreement. The French defender has played more times for the
team than any other player since joining the Gunners in 2010,
the club said on its website.  “When you consider that until 2009 he was playing in Ligue
2 in  France  and that he is now performing at the very top level
in the Premier League and for his country, the development that
he has shown has been absolutely exceptional,” manager  Arsene
Wenger  said.  Koscielny was part of France’s squad that reached the
quarterfinals at Euro 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
