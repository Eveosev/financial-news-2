Romania ’s opposition Democratic
Liberals urged voters who support suspended President Traian Basescu to boycott a referendum on July 29 to help win his
reinstatement by invalidating the impeachment vote.  The opposition said voters should stay away from the
polling stations because the ruling coalition won’t meet the
same organizational standards as in the 2009 presidential
election, increasing the possibility for electoral fraud,
Democrat Liberal leader Vasile Blaga told reporters in Bucharest
today.  The ruling Social Liberal Union don’t understand that they
“should set up the vote under the same conditions as in 2009,
when we also had surveillance cameras, so we ask citizens to
stay away from this masquerade” Blaga said.  Romania changed governments twice this year. Premier Victor Ponta and interim president Crin Antonescu want to oust Basescu
amid a power struggle that weakened the country’s currency to an
all-time low today.  The impeachment vote requires a minimum turnout of about
9.1 million of the country’s 18.3 million eligible voters,
according to a Constitutional Court ruling. A lower turnout
during the summer holidays may give the president a chance to
keep his job.  Some 700,000 Romanians are planning to boycott the vote,
according to a survey, Basescu said in an interview with private
television station B1TV late yesterday. He also said he
“normally” would have expected to garner about 35 percent of
the votes in his favor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
