The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission may sue Miami over whether the city adequately
disclosed financial information when it raised money from
investors.  The SEC yesterday told Miami that its staff, after a more
than two-year probe, plans to recommend that the agency’s
commissioners bring civil fraud charges, the Florida city said 
in a disclosure to investors today.  The SEC has been investigating the city since at least
December 2009, when it sought information about the transfer of
money for capital projects to the city’s general fund in 2007
and 2008. The transfers made the city’s finances appear stronger
as it dealt with flagging property taxes and growing pension
obligations.  The city said it plans to argue against a lawsuit.  “The city respectfully disagrees with the SEC staff’s
position and intends to present information to the SEC’s
commissioners demonstrating that such challenges are not
warranted,” it said in the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
