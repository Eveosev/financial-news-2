Indonesia , the world’s third-largest
exporter of liquefied natural gas, may require importers of the
fuel to invest in its  renewable-energy  projects.  “We propose to buyers to help us develop renewable energy,
because we also need fuel,” Gde Pradnyana, deputy chairman at
the national oil and gas regulator BPMigas, said in Jakarta
today. “That way, they can get the gas while our energy need
can still be met.”  The agency is still drafting details of the policy, which
may apply to new and existing buyers who want to extend their
contracts, Pradnyana said.  Indonesia wants solar power and other renewable sources to
play a bigger role in its energy mix so it can cut petroleum
consumption. The government plan to boost renewables to 5
percent of its energy by 2025 from nothing now, according to
data from the energy and mineral resources ministry in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
