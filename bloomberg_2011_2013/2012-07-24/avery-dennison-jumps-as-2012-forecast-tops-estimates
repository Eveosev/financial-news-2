Avery Dennison  Corp., a label
manufacturer, climbed the most in more than eight months after a
narrower forecast for full-year profit exceeded analystsâ€™
estimates.  Avery Dennison advanced 7.3 percent to $30.31 at the close
in  New York  for the biggest gain since Oct. 27.  The company, which has seen revenue declines in the last
three quarters, plans to reduce annual costs by more than $100
million by mid-2013. Avery Dennison will reduce certain
corporate-support functions, Chief Executive Officer Dean Scarborough said on a call with analysts today after the company
issued its forecast.  Profit from continuing operations may total $1.90 to $2.05
a share in 2012, the Pasadena, California-based company said in
a statement. That compared to an average analyst estimate of
$1.96 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company had  previously  forecast $1.80 to $2.15.  Second-quarter adjusted profit of 56 cents a share topped
the average analyst forecast of 54 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue slipped 1 percent to $1.53 billion. That compared
to an average analyst estimate of $1.54 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
