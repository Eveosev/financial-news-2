Kior Inc. (KIOR) , the Texas producer of
gasoline and diesel from wood, rose the most in four months
after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classified the
company’s cellulosic gasoline as a motor-vehicle fuel.  Kior rose 13 percent to $8.30 at the close in New York, the
most since March 22.  The company was granted Part 79 registration status from
the EPA for its Renewable Gasoline Blendstock 5, a required step
before Kior may sell its fuel for use in vehicles, according to
a statement today. The registration enables sales of a fuel
mixture containing 5 percent Kior fuel and 95 percent
“commercially available gasoline,” Kate Perez, a Kior
spokeswoman, said by telephone.  The Pasadena, Texas-based company rose 11 percent May 14
when Chief Executive Officer Fred Cannon said it had completed
construction of its first plant in Columbus,  Mississippi . The
facility is expected to start up “later this year,” Kior said
today, without providing a date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
