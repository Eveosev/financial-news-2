German manufacturing and services
output contracted more than economists forecast in July.  A German index based on a survey of  purchasing managers  in
the manufacturing industry declined to 43.3 this month from 45.0
in June, while a services gauge fell to 49.7 from 49.9, London-
based  Markit Economics  said in an e-mailed report today. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction. Economists had forecast
a reading of 45.1 for the manufacturing index and 50.0 for the
services gauge, according to the median estimates in Bloomberg
News surveys.  The reading for manufacturing is the lowest in 37 months,
Markit said. The services index is at a 10-month low, it said.  ``German business conditions are far less healthy than 
those seen during the first half of 2012, especially across 
the manufacturing sector where new export orders fell at the 
fastest pace for over three years,'' Tim Moore, senior economist 
at Markit, said in the report. ``The stage could well be set for 
a steeper drop in GDP than the 0.2 percent fall recorded at the 
end of 2011.''   A separate report by Markit for  France  showed that the 
manufacturing gauge for that nation fell to 43.6 in July from 
45.2 in the prior month, while the services index rose to 50.2 
from 47.9, Markit said. Economists had forecast a reading of 
45.5 for the manufacturing index and 47.5 for the services 
gauge, according to Bloomberg surveys.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
