Chile’s peso declined for a third
day as investors trimmed their appetite for emerging-market
currencies on concern the  European debt crisis  will deepen.  The peso depreciated 0.5 percent to 494.9 per  U.S. dollar 
at 12:29 p.m. Santiago time, from 492.6 yesterday. The Bloomberg
JPMorgan Latin American Currency Index fell 0.7 percent. Copper,
which is Chile’s main export, declined 1.1 percent to $3.3420 a
pound on the Comex in New York.  Moody’s Investors Service yesterday said it may lower its
Aaa rating on Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, leaving
 Finland  as the only one of the 17 euro-member countries with a
stable top investment grade. The euro fell to as low as $1.2043.  “The scenario has turned more negative, and that means we
have increased buying of the dollar,” said Cristian Donoso, a
trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “It’s in
line with the decline in the euro, stocks and the fall in
copper.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
