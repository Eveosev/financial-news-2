Klepierre SA (LI) , the Paris-based
shopping-center landlord 27 percent owned by Simon Property
Group Inc., said first-half profit was little changed as
disposals curbed rental income growth.  Pretax earnings excluding one-time charges, known as net
current cash flow, increased to 1 euro a share from 99 cents a
year earlier, the company said in a  statement  after the market
closed yesterday. Klepierre, Europe’s second-largest publicly
traded mall operator by market value, predicted a “slight”
drop in the full-year figure after the company issued more
shares in May.  Simon Property, based in Indianapolis, bought its stake in
the French company from BNP Paribas SA in March. Klepierre said
yesterday it’s on target to raise 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion)
from disposals by the end of 2013 after selling or agreeing to
sell 520 million euros of real estate in the first half. The
company manages or owns properties valued at about 16.4 billion
euros.  Net asset value  fell to 29.6 euros a share from 31.4 euros
at the end of last year, according to yesterday’s statement.
Rental income gained 3.2 percent to 486.1 million euros,
Klepierre said. The company has dropped 5.2 percent in Paris
trading in the past 12 months, cutting its market value to 5.2
billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
