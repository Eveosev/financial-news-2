Palm oil  dropped to the lowest level
in five weeks, falling for a third session, on concern that
Europe’s debt crisis is set to worsen, crimping demand for
commodities including edible oils.  The October-delivery contract lost 2.1 percent to end at
2,926 ringgit ($920) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest settlement for a most-active contract since
June 18. Futures have declined 7.8 percent this year.  Moody’s Investors Service cut its outlook for Germany, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg to negative, citing the region’s
fiscal crisis. Greece’s creditors meet today amid skepticism
that the country will achieve bailout targets.  “These downgrades can only reinforce the concern in the
market,” James Ratnam, an analyst at TA Securities Holdings
Bhd., said by phone today. “All these financial risks will add
anxiety into how demand will pan out.”  Soybeans for November delivery fell 2.2 percent to $15.87 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures surged yesterday
to a record $16.915. December-delivery  soybean oil  declined 2.2
percent to 53.38 cents per pound. Palm oil and soybean oil are
used in food and fuels.  Palm oil for January delivery lost 2.2 percent to close at
7,706  yuan  ($1,207) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , the
lowest close for the most-active contract since June 15. Soybean
oil for the same month fell 2.4 percent to 9,396 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
