Gold futures dropped for a second
day in  New York  on speculation that  Europe ’s debt crisis will
bolster the dollar and cut demand for the metal as an
alternative investment. Silver also retreated.  The euro fell below $1.21 for a second day after Moody’s
Investors Service yesterday lowered the credit-rating outlook
for  Germany , the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities fell for a third
session. The dollar jumped 3.3 percent against a basket of
currencies in the second quarter while gold declined 4 percent.  “The precious metals are on offer once again this morning
as the euro trades either side of $1.21 after Moody’s revised
its outlook,” Tim Gardiner, managing director at TD Securities
Inc., wrote today in a report.  Gold futures for August delivery fell 0.1 percent to settle
at $1,576.20 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
extending this month’s loss to 1.7 percent.  Silver futures for September delivery slid 0.9 percent to
$26.811 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell 0.9 percent to $1,386.60 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery declined 1.6 percent to
$561.60 an ounce, the biggest drop since July 5.  To contact the reporters for this story:
