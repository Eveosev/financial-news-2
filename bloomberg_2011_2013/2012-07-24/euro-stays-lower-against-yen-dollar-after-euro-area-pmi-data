The euro stayed lower against the
yen and the dollar after a report showed the region’s services
and manufacturing output contracted for a sixth straight month
in July.  The 17-nation shared currency fell 0.4 percent to 94.62 yen
as of 9:06 a.m. London time. It was 0.1 percent lower at
$1.2109.  A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in both industries in the 17-nation euro area was unchanged at
46.4, the same level as in June, London-based Markit Economics
said today in an initial estimate. That’s in line with the
median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
