Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said early childhood education is “crucial” and that
effective schooling supports the economy by reducing poverty,
boosting wages and increasing job satisfaction.  “Specialists in economic development have identified
educational attainment as a key source of economic growth and
rising incomes in many countries around the world,” Bernanke
said in recorded remarks to be delivered by video today to the
 Children’s Defense Fund  national conference in Cincinnati.  Children who attended “high-quality” preschools were more
likely to own homes at age 40 than those who didn’t attend
preschool, Bernanke said. Economic benefits also extend to
society as a whole because workers are more skilled, said
Bernanke, a 58-year-old former Princeton University professor
whose wife, Anna, is a teacher.  Early support makes children more likely to succeed in
school and to contribute to society as adults, while those
without it are “more likely to drop out of school, earn lower
wages, depend on government programs, or be incarcerated,” the
Fed chairman said, citing  research  from the Center on the
Developing Child at  Harvard University .  “Economically speaking, early childhood programs are a
good investment, with inflation-adjusted annual rates of return
on the funds dedicated to these programs estimated to reach 10
percent or higher,” Bernanke said. “Very few alternative
investments can promise that kind of return.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
