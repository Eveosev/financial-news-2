Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
third day on increased dollar demand from local companies
seeking to pay monthly bills.  The currency of East  Africa ’s biggest economy weakened 0.1
percent to 84.35 a dollar by 11 a.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A
close at that level would be the weakest since June 28,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is some end-month demand coming in from the energy
sector and corporates though I don’t see the shilling going
beyond 84.50 because there are proceeds coming in from the tea
sector,” Sameer Lagadia, head of trading at Nairobi-based
 Diamond Trust Bank Kenya Ltd. (DTKL) , said in a phone interview today.  Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd., the East African nation’s
only oil processor, said yesterday it took the first delivery of
crude since it began sourcing fuel to process and sell refined
products to retailers.  African tea prices rose to an average of $2.98 a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) at the last weekly sale in  Mombasa , Kenya, Tea
Brokers East Africa Ltd. said July 17. Prices increased from
$2.92 a week earlier. Kenya is the world’s biggest producer of
black tea, the main foreign-exchange earner in east Africa’s
largest economy.  Uganda ’s shilling declined for a second day and was trading
0.1 percent weaker at 2,477.50 a dollar. Tanzania’s currency
gained the most in almost a month, rising 0.5 percent to 1,583.  To contact the reporter on this story:
