Houlihan Lokey , a closely held
investment bank, hired Magnus Scaddan as head of consumer and
retail coverage for Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa.  Scaddan, who will be based in London, joined from  Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) , where he was a managing director and co-head of
consumer and retail investment banking for the region, Houlihan
Lokey said in a statement today.  Scaddan previously worked at Lehman Brothers before the
firmâ€™s European and Asian operations were acquired by Nomura,
based in Tokyo. Before that, he worked at  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  as a
managing director and head of consumer investment banking for
Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Houlihan Lokey, based in Los Angeles, said in June that it
had hired Kristian Terling from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  to head
its Nordic coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
