Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd. (493) ,  China â€™s second-biggest electronics retailer, plunged to an
all-time low in  Hong Kong  after forecasting a  first-half loss  on
lower sales and losses at its e-commerce unit.  Gome dropped 14.5 percent to close at HK$0.65, the lowest
level for the shares since trading began in 1992. The stock has
declined 64 percent this year, compared with a 2.4 percent rise
in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  The retailer reported an 88 percent profit decline in the
first quarter as China stopped subsidizing some home appliance
purchases. Larger rival Suning Appliance Co. said on July 13
that it expects first-half net income to fall by as much as 30
percent because of weaker sales and higher expenses.  The retailers last year benefited from a government
program, which ended on Dec. 31, that gave shoppers as much as
400  yuan  ($63) as subsidies on purchase of home appliances.  The company will report results by Aug. 31, Beijing-based
Gome said in a  filing  to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday,
without specifying the size of the projected loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
