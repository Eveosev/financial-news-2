Mexico â€™s anti-corruption agency
fined a former director of operations and four other officials
of the state power utility for alleged irregularities in
government contracts with private companies.  The former director was fined 69.6 million pesos ($5.1
million) and is prohibited from serving in government for 17
years, the agency, known as the Ministry of Public
Administration, said in a statement today, without naming the
executive.  The other officials of the Comision Federal de Electricidad
were fined as much as 153.9 million pesos each for their
involvement in procurement contracts that paid as much as triple
the worth of the product sold, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
