Treasury 30-year bond yields fell to
a record low as Spanish borrowing costs rose amid concern
Europe’s debt crisis is spreading to the region’s strongest
nations.  U.S. government debt  rose after a report from Reuters cited
European Union officials saying Greece was seen missing targets
for reducing debt. Treasury yields rose earlier before the
government auctions $35 billion in two-year notes in the first
of three auctions this week totaling $99 billion. The  U.S.
economy  probably expanded in the second quarter at the slowest
pace in a year, a report this week may show.  “The lack of good news at this point is bad news,” said
 Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at the broker-dealer BTIG
LLC in New York. “As long as Europe continues to be a concern
and U.S. economic numbers come down, the Treasury auctions
should be well bid.”  Thirty-year yields fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.48 percent as of 12:44 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It touched a record
2.4738 percent. Ten-year Treasury  yields  declined two basis
points to 1.41 percent after touching a record low 1.3960
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
