Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) ,  Turkey ’s
biggest publicly traded state-controlled bank, may say second-
quarter profit rose about 20 percent as revenue increased and
the cost of deposits fell.  Net income will probably rise to 617.3 million liras ($338
million) from 512.3 million liras in the year-earlier period,
according to the average estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Halkbank is scheduled to report earnings today.  “Halkbank’s net income rises as revenues from loans
increase and deposits costs have been on a horizontal or
downward trend for the past quarters,” Aykut Saribiyik, an
analyst at FinansInvest, said in a telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
