Let's hope an  article  in today's  New York  Times puts an end to a ludicrous rumor that has been floating around the Internet for weeks: That "radical Islamists" have called for the demolition of the Egyptian pyramids. The myth wouldn't merit mention if it had only popped up on the fringes of the Internet.  But those sounding the Islamist alarm included a Pulitzer Prize winner, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a resident scholar at the  American Enterprise Institute , all in positions to shape U.S. public opinion. The Times article details the origins of the rumor in a tweet published June 24 by someone claiming to be a prominent Bahraini sheik, Abdellatif al-Mahmoud. The Egyptian magazine Rose el-Youssef picked up the rumor, and an array of right-wing blogs and news sites ran with it. The rumor gained new traction on Friday when syndicated columnists  Joel Brinkley  and  Victor Davis Hanson  weighed in. Brinkley, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for international reporting,  wrote : Brinkley didn't believe Sheik Mahmoud's tweet was fake. "After the Bahraini sheikh's remarks went viral, he improbably denied making them," he wrote. Yet the description of the Twitter account in question,  @amahmood2011 , states in Arabic that it is an  "official parody account." Hanson, a senior fellow at the  Hoover Institution  at Stanford, also fell into the trap of  lumping together  Islamists of different stripes: Hanson also cited the  destruction of ancient sites  in  Mali  by "Islamic extremists" and in Afghanistan by the Taliban. The problem with such commentary is the Muslim Brotherhood are hardly the Taliban. After capturing Kabul in September 1996, the Taliban "launched a theatrical and bloody campaign to impose their vision of Islamic discipline on Kabul's residents," wrote scholars Robert Crews and Amin Tarzi in "The Taliban and the Crisis of  Afghanistan ." "Traveling by Toyota trucks and wielding guns and whips made of radio antennas, the Taliban strung television sets as well as audio and videotapes, along with the bodies of their political opponents, on lampposts and trees in a spectacular assault on the modern world." In sharp contrast, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood renounced violence in the 1970s and has committed itself to civil politics. It has been providing social services across  Egypt  since the 1930s, often in the absence of state services. Brotherhood-run programs are available to all Egyptians, regardless of political or religious orientation. Under the former dictator  Hosni Mubarak , Brotherhood members of Parliament pushed back against the emergency law that curbed freedom of assembly, dissent and political activity. Since taking power, President Morsi has said he plans to appoint a woman and a Coptic Christian as his deputies. Morsi, who holds a doctorate in electrical engineering from the University of  Southern California , vowed repeatedly in his acceptance speech to be "a president for all Egyptians." Two of his five children are U.S. citizens. Sound like the Taliban? Not quite. Michael Rubin , the American Enterprise Institute scholar, was a bit more measured than Brinkley and Hanson in his analysis of the pyramid story, but  was still troubled  that the rumor gained traction in the Arabic media. "The calls to destroy the Pyramids are certainly fringe, and do not represent the vast majority of the Egyptian public or the Egyptian leadership, even amongst the Muslim Brotherhood," Rubin wrote in Commentary Magazine on July 11. "Still, that such a fringe and wacky idea gains any voice in Arabic media or on Islamist websites should be cause for concern, given precedent." No, the real cause for concern here is that such nonsense was taken seriously by the Western news media.
