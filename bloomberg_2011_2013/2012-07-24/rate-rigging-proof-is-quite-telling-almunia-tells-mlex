European Union antitrust officials
have gathered “quite telling” evidence in their probes related
to the rigging of interbank lending rates, Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia   said  in an interview with MLex.  “The evidence we have collected is quite telling so I am
pretty sure this investigation will not be closed without
results,” Almunia told MLex today. Antoine Colombani, a
spokesman for Almunia, confirmed the comments in an e-mail.  Confidence in Libor, a benchmark for financial products
valued at $360 trillion worldwide, has been shaken by  Barclays
Plc (BARC) ’s admission that it submitted false rates.  Robert Diamond ,
who resigned as London-based Barclays’s chief executive officer
after the bank was fined 290 million pounds ($449 million), told
British lawmakers this month that other banks also lowballed
Libor submissions.  Almunia has previously said that regulators are
investigating the markets for derivatives linked to the euro,
London and Tokyo interbank lending rates.  Libor, the London interbank offered rate, is determined by
a daily poll carried out on behalf of the British Bankers’
Association that asks banks to estimate how much it would cost
to borrow from each other for different periods and in different
currencies. Similarly, Euribor, the euro equivalent, is overseen
by the European Banking Federation in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
