TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) , the online travel-
recommendation service spun off from  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  in December,
plunged as much as 19 percent after second-quarter revenue
missed analysts’ estimates.  TripAdvisor fell 18 percent to $35.82 at 10:17 a.m. in New
York. The shares, up 72 percent this year, had tumbled as low as
$35.01 earlier in the session, marking their biggest intraday
decline since the stock began trading last year.  Revenue climbed 16 percent to $197.1 million, the Newton,
Massachusetts-based company said yesterday in a statement.
Analysts had estimated sales of $203.6 million on average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding some items,
earnings were 41 cents a share, matching analyst projections.  TripAdvisor and other travel companies are facing headwinds
from the sputtering economy and the credit crisis in Europe,
which has crimped  consumer spending . The company’s website, a
repository for user-generated reviews of hotels and other travel
businesses, relies on advertising and subscriptions for revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
