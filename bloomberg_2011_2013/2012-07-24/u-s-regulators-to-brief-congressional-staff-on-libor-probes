U.S. regulators will brief
congressional staff July 30 on oversight of the London interbank
offered rate, according to a notice circulated to House
Financial Service Committee staff members today.  Representatives from the Treasury Department,  Federal
Reserve ,  Federal Reserve Bank of New York , Securities and
Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
and Commodity Futures Trading Commission will head to  Capitol
Hill  to brief the committee staff on “regulatory oversight of
Libor,” according to the notice obtained by Bloomberg News.  The briefing announcement comes one day after two  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  employees briefed the committee’s staff on the bank’s $452
million settlement for attempted manipulation of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
