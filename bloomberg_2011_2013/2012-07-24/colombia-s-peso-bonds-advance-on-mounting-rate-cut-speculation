Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
down yields for a fourth day, as speculation mounted that the
central bank will cut  interest rates  as soon as this week to
buoy growth amid slower industrial production and retail sales.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 6.74 percent at 10:16 a.m. in Bogota, according to the
central bank. That’s the lowest on a closing basis since the
debt was first issued in 2009. The price rose 0.3 centavo to
126.293 centavos per peso.  Colombia’s central bank will lower the  overnight lending
rate  at its July 27 meeting by a quarter percentage point to 5
percent, according to nine of 24 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Fifteen expect the key rate to remain unchanged at
5.25 percent for a fifth straight month.  “The economy is clearly weakening and the possibility of a
rate cut is increasing,” Julian Cardenas, head analyst at ING
Pensiones y Cesantias, said by phone from Bogota. “So much so
that we may even see a cut on Friday.” He forecasts the lending
rate will be lowered to 4.75 percent by year-end.  Industrial output fell for a third straight month in May on
an annual basis and retail sales rose 0.9 percent, missing the
3.5 percent median estimate among economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, the national statistics agency said July 19. That
follows a June 21 government report showing the economy expanded
4.7 percent in the first quarter, the slowest pace since 2010.  Speculation that there will be a rate cut mounted after
minutes of the central bank’s most recent meeting, released July
13, showed more than one member of the seven-member board voted
for a quarter-point interest rate reduction last month and
wanted the bank to begin a “relaxation phase.”  The peso slipped for a fourth day, declining 0.4 percent to
1,796.70 per dollar. The loss pared this year’s gain to 8
percent, the best performance among all currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
