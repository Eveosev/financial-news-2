Fresno,  California , had its ratings
on $462 million of debt lowered one step by Moody’s Investors
Service because of deteriorating finances.  The city’s long-term issuer rating was cut to A3, the
fourth-lowest investment grade, from A2. Its pension obligation
bonds were downgraded to Baa1, third-lowest, from A2 and its
lease-revenue bonds fell to Baa2, one step lower, from Baa1, the
New York-based rating company said yesterday in a statement. The
outlook for the ratings is negative, meaning another downgrade
is possible.  Fresno, a city of 510,000 about 200 miles (320 kilometers)
north of  Los Angeles , may be the latest California city to
buckle under the weight of employee costs and eroding  tax
revenue  in the wake of the recession. Stockton, San Bernardino
and Mammoth Lakes have taken steps toward bankruptcy in the last
month.  “The downgrade reflects the city’s exceedingly weak
financial position and uncertainties embedded in the city’s
adopted budget, most notably $12 million of budget-gap closing
solutions,” Moody’s said in the statement. “These solutions
continue to rely on labor concessions, which have proven to be
difficult to achieve.”  Fresno, in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley, is the
largest inland city in California and the 34th largest in the
U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
