Estonian banks’ net income declined
in the second quarter from the previous three months as net-
interest income fell and lenders recovered a lower volume of bad
debts.  Profit dropped to 90 million euros ($109 million) from 104
million euros, the central bank, based in the capital, Tallinn,
said today in an e-mailed statement. It rose 31 percent from a
year earlier, the bank said, without giving reasons for the
increase.  The Baltic nation’s lenders, led by local units of
Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  and SEB AB, face lower profitability
this year than in 2011, central bank Deputy Governor Madis
Muller said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
