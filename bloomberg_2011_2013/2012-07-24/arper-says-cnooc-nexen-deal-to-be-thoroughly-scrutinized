Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s $15.1 billion bid for  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  will
be “thoroughly scrutinized.”  “The government will make sure that investment is clearly
scrutinized to ensure that it is of net benefit if it is
approved,” said Harper, speaking to reporters in Oshawa,
Ontario today. “Nothing should be assumed in terms of the
government’s decision one way or the other on that
transaction.”  Asked if Canadian investment in China will receive
reciprocal treatment, Harper said,  “In terms of the specific
investment that is now before the government of Canada, I’m
obviously not going to comment on that, other than to say as I
just said that nobody should pre-judge the government’s
decision.”  “This investment will be thoroughly scrutinized before it
is either accepted or rejected,” he said.  Earlier today, Industry Minister Christian Paradis said the
deal must be compliant with  Canada ’s foreign-investment law,
which lists the criteria for judging if takeovers are in
Canada’s interest, including the effect on employment in Canada
and the impact on Canada’s ability to compete globally.  “There is a law in place with six criteria,” Paradis
said. “It’s not up to the government to convince Canadians that
there is a net benefit but this is for the stakeholders to do.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
