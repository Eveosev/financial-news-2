Kazakhstan’s state grain trader will
sell 1.3 million metric tons of stockpiled cereals to local
millers in an effort to cap bread prices after a drought in main
growing regions.  JSC National Co. Food Contract Corp. will supply the grain
over the year starting Aug. 1 at a fixed price of 28,000 tenge
($186) a ton, according to an Agriculture Ministry statement
distributed today to journalists in the capital city of Astana.  The company bought 5 million tons of grain last year from
the 2011 harvest, of which 2 million tons held for state
inventories would be milled to make flour and sold on the
domestic market at fixed prices, Chief Executive Officer
Beybitkhan Kabdrakhmanov said July 20. The rest was to be sold
at market prices, he said.  The country’s grain crop may shrink to 12.8 million tons
this year from the record 26.9 million tons reaped in the prior
period, according to a statement on the government’s website
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
