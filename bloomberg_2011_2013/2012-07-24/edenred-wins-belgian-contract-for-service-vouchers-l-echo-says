Edenred (EDEN)  won a Belgian contract to
provide service vouchers in 2013, replacing  Sodexo (SW) , L’Echo
reported, citing a decision from the country’s national
employment office that isn’t yet public.  Sodexo is appealing the decision, the newspaper said. The
vouchers, which can be used to pay for childcare and cleaning
services, cost the employment office 1.4 billion euros ($1.7
billion) a year, according to L’Echo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
