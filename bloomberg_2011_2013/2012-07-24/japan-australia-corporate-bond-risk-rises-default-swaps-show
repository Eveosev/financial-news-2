The cost of insuring Japanese and
Australian corporate bonds from non-payment increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 2.5 basis points to 187
basis points as of 9:28 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index is set to close at the highest level since June
26, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index increased 2 basis points
to 183 basis points as of 10:20 a.m. in Sydney, National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices show.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 174 basis points
as of 8:30 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge jumped 9.5 basis points yesterday, the
biggest one-day increase since June 1, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
