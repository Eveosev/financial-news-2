FedEx Corp. (FDX)  raised $1 billion in a
two-part offering today, including its first 30-year bond in
more than two decades.  The world’s largest cargo airline issued $500 million each
of 2.625 percent bonds due in 2022 that yielded 125 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries and 3.875 percent, 30-year
debt with a 150 basis-point spread, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. FedEx, rated three levels above junk at Baa1 by
Moody’s Investors Service, last sold 30-year bonds in 1989, when
it issued $100 million of 9.625 percent debt that was called in
2000, the data show.  Borrowing costs for FedEx at 2.13 percent are less than the
3.37 percent average among peers, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. corporate transportation index. The
company plans to boost air cargo profit margins to at least 10
percent, partly by replacing junkyard-ready jets with more
efficient models. The  gauge  was 4.8 percent in fiscal 2012 that
ended in May.  “FedEx’s massive international shipping network would be
difficult and costly to duplicate, earning the company a narrow
economic moat,” Jeffrey Cannon, an analyst at Chicago-based
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , wrote today in a research note.  The extra yield investors demand to own its 8 percent bonds
due in 2019 instead of  government securities  was 96.2 basis
points June 27, giving the note a yield of 2.59 percent,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The spread on higher-
rated  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) ’s similar-maturity 5.125
percent debt was 15 basis points June 28 with a 1.72 percent
yield.  UPS, the world’s largest package-delivery company, cut its
full-year forecast today after a drop in international sales
dragged quarterly profit below analysts’ estimates.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed
the new debt sale, according to a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
