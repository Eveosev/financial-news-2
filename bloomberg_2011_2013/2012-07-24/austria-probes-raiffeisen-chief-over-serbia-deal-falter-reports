Austria’s financial regulator FMA is
investigating whether alleged links to real estate deal in
 Serbia  taint  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  Chief Executive
Officer Herbert Stepic such that he would be “unfit” to run
the bank under Austrian law,  Falter  reported today, citing
confidential files.  Stepic and Austrian and Serbian investors bought land near
Serbia’s capital Belgrade with a 23 million-euro ($28 million)
loan, according to Falter newspaper, which cited documentation
of creditor bank Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG obtained
in the FMA’s probe. The land, which was bought from Serbia’s
government, was worth 65 million euros, according to Hypo Alpe’s
estimates at the time, Falter said. The deal was made through a
Cypriot vehicle and the loan is now non-performing, according to
the Vienna-based paper.  FMA spokesman Klaus Grubelnik said the regulator is
investigating the alleged links, which were first reported by
Profil magazine last year. He declined to elaborate. Raiffeisen
spokeswoman Ingrid Krenn-Ditz and Hypo Alpe spokesman Nikola Donig declined to comment.  Stepic, 65, has been CEO of Raiffeisen since 2001.  Austrian banking law requires a so-called “fit and
proper” test to ensure, among other requirements, that senior
managers’ economic relationships are “orderly,” and that there
are “no indications that call into doubt the person’s
reliability required for managing” a bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
