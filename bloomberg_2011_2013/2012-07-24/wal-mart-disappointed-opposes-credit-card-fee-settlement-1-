Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, said it is “disappointed” in a proposed
credit card interchange fee settlement.  The settlement won’t stop credit card networks from
increasing hidden swipe fees, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based
retailer said today in a statement.  This month, Visa Inc.,  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  and some of the
biggest U.S. banks agreed to a settlement of at least $6.05
billion with retailers in a price-fixing case over credit card
swipe fees, according to a court filing.  Wal-Mart urged other retailers to reject the settlement,
the company said in a statement. Wal-Mart also said it’s pushing
for more transparency in fees to encourage competition among
financial institutions.  “The proposed settlement would not structurally change the
broken market or prohibit credit card networks from continually
increasing hidden swipe fees, which already cost consumers tens
of billions of dollars each year,” Wal-Mart said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
