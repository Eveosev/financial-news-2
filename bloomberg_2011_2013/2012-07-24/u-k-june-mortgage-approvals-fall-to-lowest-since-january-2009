U.K. mortgage approvals fell to the
lowest more than 3 1/2 years in June as an extra public holiday
and wet weather created a drag on the market, the  British
Bankers Association  said.  Mortgage approvals fell to 26,269, the lowest since January
2009, from 29,567 in May, the BBA said in an e-mailed statement
today in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
