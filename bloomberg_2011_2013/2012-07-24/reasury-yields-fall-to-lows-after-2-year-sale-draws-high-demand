Treasuries rose, with yields falling
to records for a second consecutive day, amid concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis is spreading to the region’s strongest nations.  Yields on five, 10- and 30-year securities touched new lows
after a report from Reuters cited European Union officials
saying  Greece  was seen missing targets for reducing debt. Yields
on  Spain  and  Italy ’s debt rose. The U.S. sold $35 billion in
two-year notes, drawing almost record demand and an all-time low
yield, and is scheduled to auction an equal amount in five-year
notes tomorrow.  “People are flocking back into the Treasury market,” said
 Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in  New York . “All of Europe is
now feeling it. There’s a global flood and guys are going out
for yield.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note  fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.3875 percent at 5 p.m. in
New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The  yield 
sank below the 1.396 percent it reached yesterday. The 1.75
percent note due in May 2022 rose 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000
face amount, to 103 10/32.  The five-year note fell to 0.5394 percent and the 30-year
bond declined to 2.4530 percent, less than yesterday’s 0.5411
percent and 2.4752 percent.  Valuation measures show U.S. sovereign securities are at
the most costly levels ever. The term premium, a model created
by economists at the Fed, dropped to negative 1.023 percent, the
all-time most expensive. A negative reading indicates investors
are willing to accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  Euro Records  U.S. government securities returned 1.3 percent this month
through yesterday, including reinvested interest, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. German debt returned 2.5
percent, the indexes showed, while the MSCI All-Country World
Index of stocks dropped 2 percent in the period on a similar
total return basis.  Spanish bonds fell earlier, pushing five- and 10-year
yields to euro-era records, as the nation’s borrowing costs rose
at an auction amid concern its banks’ and regions’ debts will
force it to seek a sovereign bailout.  Italy’s 10-year bonds declined for a third day after
services and manufacturing in the euro region shrank in July.  Officials of Greece’s troika of international creditors --
the European Commission,  European Central Bank  and  International
Monetary Fund  -- arrived in  Athens  today amid doubts the nation
will meet the commitments attached to its bailout funding.  ‘Well Bid’  Germany ’s bunds sank, pushing up yields from close to all-
time lows, after Moody’s cut the outlook on the nation’s top
rating citing concern it will have to support weaker euro-region
members. The euro fell below $1.21 for a second day. The  yield
difference , or spread, between the German and U.S. debt narrowed
to 15 basis points, the least on a closing basis since July 3.  “As long as Europe continues to be a concern and U.S.
economic numbers come down, the Treasury auctions should be well
bid,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at the
broker-dealer BTIG LLC in New York.  U.S. two-year notes yielded an auction record 0.220 percent
today, the same as in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. The previous auction low
was 0.222 percent in August 2011. The yield on the current two-
year note was little changed at 0.21 percent after touching a
record 0.1431 in September 2011.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was the
second-highest ever at 4.0, compared with an average of 3.72 for
the past 10 sales. The record was 4.07 percent in November 2011.  ‘Dumping Supply’  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 30.9 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 34 percent for the past 10 sales. Direct
bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, purchased 9.9 percent of the notes
at the sale, compared with an average of 11 percent.  “It’s clear that there are not enough of the securities to
meet the market’s demand,” said  Scott Sherman , an interest-rate
strategist in New York at Credit Suisse Group AG, a primary
dealers. “The Fed had committed to dumping supply there and yet
these auctions still do well, which tells you that there is
still a ton of demand for risk-free assets here.”  The Treasury is selling $99 billion in notes and bonds this
week, including $29 billion of seven-year debt July 26.  Two-year notes have gained 0.2 percent this year, compared
with 3 percent gain for Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Quantitative Easing  The Fed purchased $1.81 billion of Treasuries due from
February 2036 to May 2042 today as part of a program known as
Operation Twist. The central bank is swapping short-term
Treasuries in its holdings for longer maturities in a bid to
send borrowing costs lower and stimulate the economy.  Fed Governor  Sarah Bloom Raskin  said yesterday U.S. policy
makers will debate at a meeting next week whether to start
another program to spur growth through large-scale Fed purchases
of bonds.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of mortgage and
Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing, seeking to cap borrowing costs.  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and TIPS,
which represents traders’ expectations for the rate of inflation
over the life of the securities and is known as the break-even
rate, was 2.03 percentage points, the lowest since Jan. 17. It
is down from the 2012 high of 2.45 percentage points on March
20. It touched a 2012 low of 1.9 percentage points on Jan. 3.  Economic Data  Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
the nation produced, rose at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the
second quarter after a 1.9 percent gain in the prior quarter,
according to the median forecast of 70 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Factory orders softened and new-home sales were
little changed, other data may show.  Sales of new homes may have risen to a 371,000 annual pace
in June, the most since April 2010, according to economist
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey before figures from the
Commerce Department tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
