(Corrects Ebitda margin projection in third paragraph.)  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*)  slashed its
forecasts for 2012 revenue and profit margins in its housing
division, according to a report posted on the stock exchange
website.  Housing revenue will climb 3 percent to 4 percent, down
from a previous projection of 10 percent to 12 percent growth,
the company said today in its  quarterly report .  The divisionâ€™s projected margin of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of
profit known as Ebitda -- was cut by 100 basis points to a range
of 20 percent to 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
