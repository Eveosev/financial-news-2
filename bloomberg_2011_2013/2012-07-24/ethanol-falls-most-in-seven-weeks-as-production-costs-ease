Ethanol futures fell the most in
seven weeks in  Chicago  as production costs eased with lower corn
prices because rain may ease a drought in the U.S.  Rain may fall in parts of Iowa and  Illinois  this week and
next, and the Midwest might get showers in the next 11 to 15
days, reducing severe moisture deficits from the worst drought
since 1988, said Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 5.5 cents, or
2.1 percent, to settle at $2.596 a gallon at 2:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest decline since June 1.  Corn for December delivery fell 7.25 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $7.7825 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  decreased 3.5
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.62 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive fell 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.525, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 2.5 cents, or 1 percent,
to $2.575 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel plunged
14.5 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $2.725.  To contact the reporters on this story:
