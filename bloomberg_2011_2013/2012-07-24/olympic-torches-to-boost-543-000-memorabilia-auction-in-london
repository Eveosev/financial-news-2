Olympic torches, including one from
the 1948 games, the last time the event was held in  London , will
boost a memorabilia auction today that may raise at least
350,000 pounds ($543,000).  The 1948 torch, estimated at as much as 3,500 pounds, is
among 215 lots being offered by Bonhams in London. The eyes of
the world are centering on the U.K. capital, where the opening
ceremony of the 2012 Olympics takes place on July 27.  “We’ve chosen to have it now because there’s a massive
worldwide interest in the Olympics,” Lionel Willis, a
specialist in the collectors’ department at Bonhams, said in an
interview. It was a one-time event, he said.  Collectors are also being offered rare photographs of U.S.
athlete Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 1936
Olympics in Berlin and infuriated Nazis who believed in Aryan
superiority.  Also on sale is a kit bag belonging to the British runner
Harold Abrahams, winner of the 1924 100-meter sprint and the
subject of the 1981 film “Chariots of Fire.”  A competitors’ handbook from the 1948 Olympics, dubbed the
“austerity games,” highlights how much the event has changed.
Participants are reminded to bring their own soap and towel.  The guide also reveals an early example of Olympic
sponsorship. Male athletes were advised that they would receive
two pairs of Y-Front briefs.  The Olympic Games Sale takes place at 2 p.m. at Bonhams in
Knightsbridge, London.  Information:  http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19618/   To contact the writer on the story:
