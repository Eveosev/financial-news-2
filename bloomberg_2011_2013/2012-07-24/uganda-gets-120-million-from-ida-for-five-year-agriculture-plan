The  International Development
Association  will loan  Uganda  $120 million to finance plans to
increase agricultural production over the next five years, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  The loan will support the $666 million the East Africa
nation plans to spend by 2017 to boost farmers’ incomes, the
ministry said in a supplement published today in Kampala, the
capital. Uganda will pay $497 million of that amount and donors
including the European Union and Denmark will supply the rest,
it said.  Agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of Uganda’s gross
domestic product, and the government wants to increase crop,
livestock and fish output to serve domestic markets and boost
regional and international export revenue, the ministry said.  Uganda exports mainly food to neighboring countries
including Kenya and South Sudan, and cash crops such as coffee,
cotton, tobacco, tea and cocoa to global markets, according to
the ministry.  Uganda is Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer, after
Ethiopia, and the continent’s largest robusta grower. The nation
was Africa’s biggest coffee exporter and the world’s ninth-
largest in the 12 months through last September, according to
the London-based International Coffee Organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
