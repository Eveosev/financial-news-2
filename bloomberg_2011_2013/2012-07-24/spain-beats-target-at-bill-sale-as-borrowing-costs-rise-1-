Spain ’s borrowing costs rose amid
concern the nation may require a second bailout as the
government exceeded its target at a Treasury bill auction.  The Treasury in  Madrid  today sold 3.05 billion euros ($3.69
billion) of bills, more than the 3 billion euros sought. The
yield for three-month bills rose to 2.43 percent from 2.36
percent on June 26. Six-month bills rose to 3.69 percent from
3.24 percent last month. That is the most since eight-year highs
on Nov. 22 at respectively 5.11 percent and 5.23 percent.  Spain’s benchmark  10-year bond yield  reached a euro-era
record today. The nation’s seven-month old government is
struggling to convince investors Spain won’t need more European
funds after clinching as much as 100 billion euros in loans for
its banks as the country’s recession deepens.  “It’s positive news that they’ve issued the full amount,
but it is only three months,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income
strategist at Citigroup Inc. in  London . “It is a relatively
easy auction for them as opposed to the bond auction which will
be a much tougher test.”  Spain returns to the market on Aug. 2 to sell bonds. The
Treasury today said it has covered 68.6 percent of the bonds it
plans to sell this year, allowing it to stick to a “prudent”
strategy.  Demand was 2.94 times the amount sold for the three-month
securities, compared with 2.6 times in June. The bid-to-cover
ratio for the six-month bills was 3.02 up from 2.82.  Curve Inverts  The gap between short-term borrowing costs and long-term
yields further narrowed as five-year notes dropped, pushing the
yield on the securities briefly above the nation’s 10-year bond
for the first time since the euro was created in 1999.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond rose 2 basis
points after the sale to 7.57 percent, after climbing as high as
7.58 percent at 10:12 a.m. in Madrid. The rate for the five-year
benchmark was 7.424 percent, down from a euro-era record 7.452
percent at 10:15 a.m.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos will visit Berlin today
for crisis talks with German counterpart  Wolfgang Schaeuble  as
Spain has had to take on an additional burden of helping its 17
semi-autonomous regions secure funding, while its own bond
yields are at levels the government has termed unsustainable.  “Even sales of short-term debt are a struggle,” said
Nicholas Spiro, head of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, in an e-mailed
comment. “Pretty much everything that could go wrong in Spain
is” as the bank-focused bailout is perceived as insufficient,
regions put more pressure on Spain’s creditworthiness and the
recession deepens, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
