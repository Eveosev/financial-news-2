Higher global food costs caused by
the drought in the U.S. could lead to lower steel prices by
prompting  China  to curb inflation and slow demand for metals,
said Barry Ehrlich, a Moscow-based analyst at  Alfa Bank .  A sustained 20 percent increase in agricultural prices in
the U.S. could push up Chinese inflation by 260 basis points, as
food accounts for about 30 percent of the country’s CPI, Ehrlich
said in a report published today.  Soybean and corn prices climbed to all-time highs this
week, as U.S. farmers face the worst drought since 1956,  India 
delays sowing because of a late monsoon and below-average
rainfall confronts Australian crops. China accounts for 48
percent of global steel consumption and any pull back on
stimulus measures aimed at controlling inflation would slow home
sales and construction, hurting steel demand, Ehrlich said.  “Investors should be alert that if prices remain at high
levels or more higher, this will likely have a negative impact
on steel demand and pricing,” Ehrlich said.  The risks are higher for Russian steelmakers, as rising
global food prices rise may contribute to political and social
tensions in oil-producing countries and “likely exert upward
pressure” on oil and the ruble, Ehrlich said.  Russian steelmakers could see costs rising, adding to a
squeeze on their profits as prices decline, he said. Steel
prices are at about their lowest for at least two years minimum,
