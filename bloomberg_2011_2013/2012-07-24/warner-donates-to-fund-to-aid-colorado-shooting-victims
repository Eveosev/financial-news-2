Warner Bros ., the studio that
released “The Dark Knight Rises,” made an unspecified donation
to a fund that will aid victims of the shooting that took place
at a screening of the movie last week in Colorado.  Warner worked with Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper to
identify the  Community First Foundation ’s Aurora Victim Relief
Fund, to aid surviving victims and families of the 12 people
slain in the shooting, Susan Fleishman, a spokeswoman for the
 Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  film unit, said yesterday in an interview.  Fleishman declined to say how much the studio has given.
Warner employees can contribute as well through a link on the
Givingfirst.org website, Fleishman said.  The shooting took place early on July 20, at a midnight
screening of the Batman movie at an Aurora, Colorado, movie
theater. James Holmes, arrested in the shooting deaths, is being
held on suspicion of first-degree murder, a charge that can
carry the death penalty.  The  Hollywood Reporter  reported yesterday that the studio
will make a contribution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
