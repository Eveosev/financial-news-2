Iran  launched its largest
domestically built oil tanker, the state-run  Fars  news agency
reported, citing Salman Zarbi, managing director of Iran Marine
Industrial Co., which constructed the vessel.  The ship, the first of four ordered by Venezuela and known
as an Aframax, is capable of carrying 113,000 metric tons of
crude, Zarbi said, according to Fars today. That equates to
750,000 barrels of oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
