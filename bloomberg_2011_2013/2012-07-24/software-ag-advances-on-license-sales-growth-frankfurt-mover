Software AG (SOW) , Germany’s second-
largest maker of  business software , rose the most in nine months
in  Frankfurt  after license sales advanced in the second quarter.  The shares gained as much as 11 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since Oct. 19, and were up 9.8 percent at
25.70 euros as of 3:45 p.m., valuing the Darmstadt-based company
at 2.23 billion euros ($2.7 billion).  The software-maker lifted full-year guidance for its
enterprise transaction systems unit after the division increased
license revenue by 20 percent to 30.1 million euros. License
sales for Business Process Excellence climbed to 45.6 million
euros from 31.3 million euros a year earlier. Total sales rose
to 258.6 million euros from 257.1 million euros, in line with
the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “After the first quarter the  capital market  was cautious
about Software AG,” Mirko Maier, an analyst at Germany’s
Landesbank LBBW, said by phone today. “Now we have to say that
the results are a positive surprise.”  The software-maker lifted its full-year guidance for the
ETS unit to a fall in revenue in a range of 3 percent to 6
percent, compared with a previous forecast for a drop of 7
percent to 12 percent.  The company’s shares were down 18 percent this year before
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
