South African bonds fell for a
second day, stalling a rally that drove yields to record lows,
as investors sold riskier assets on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
is set to worsen.  Yields on benchmark 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 rose 15
basis points to 6.77 percent as of 1:30 p.m. in Johannesburg,
adding to yesterday’s 12 basis-point gain. Yields tumbled 32
basis points in two days to 6.50 percent, a record low, on July
20, after the central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark
repurchase rate on July 19. Yields have declined 121 basis
points this year.  Moody’s lowered the outlooks on the Aaa credit ratings of
 Germany , the Netherlands and Luxembourg yesterday, citing the
“rising uncertainty” about Europe’s debt crisis.  Spain ’s
bailout of its regions pushed the nation closer to a full
international rescue after 10-year borrowing costs climbed to a
euro-era record of 7.58 percent.  The rise in South Africa’s yields “highlighted, once
again, the significant impact that international developments
are playing in the local interest rate market,” Theuns de Wet
and Mamello Matikinca, analysts at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, wrote in e-mailed comments. “With global risk
appetite falling, bond yields moved higher.”  South African bonds have returned 12 percent this year, the
fourth-best performance out of 26 nations tracked by
Bloomberg/EFFAS indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
