Former A.T. Kearney Inc. partner
Sherif Mityas asked to be sentenced to only probation for
trading on information he learned as a consultant to the  Carlyle
Group (CG)  about the private equity firm’s 2010 purchase of vitamin
maker NBTY Inc.  Mityas, who pleaded guilty in March to one count of
 securities fraud , filed a memorandum in  Brooklyn , New York,
federal court requesting that a judge impose a three-year term
of probation. Federal guidelines point to a sentence of 10 to 16
months in prison, the filing said.  “Mr. Mityas’s history and characteristics along with the
nature and circumstances of the offense paint a picture of a
responsible, middle-aged family man whose mounting financial
stressors led him to make this one foray into criminal
conduct,” his attorney, Eric A. Chase, wrote in the memorandum.  Mityas realized a profit of $25,871 by trading on non-
public information about the NBTY deal. He has agreed to forfeit
that amount, the filing said.  The case is U.S. v. Mityas, 1:12-cr-00133, U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of  New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
