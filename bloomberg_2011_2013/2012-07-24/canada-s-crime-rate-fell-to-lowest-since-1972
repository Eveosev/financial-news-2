Canada ’s crime rate fell to the
lowest since 1972 last year, government figures showed,
extending a drop that began in the early 1990s.  There were 5,756 crimes reported to the police per 100,000
people last year, a decline of 6 percent,  Statistics Canada  said
today in Ottawa. Declines were reported for offenses including
attempted murders, sexual assaults and car thefts.  A separate index measuring the severity of crime also fell
6 percent last year and has fallen by 26 percent over the past
decade, Statistics Canada said. The agency has compiled a census
of reports from police departments since 1962.  Regina, Saskatchewan had the highest crime-severity index
reading, while Winnipeg, Manitoba had the country’s highest
homicide rate last year, the statistics agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
