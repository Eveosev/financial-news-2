Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of  China ’s largest
online search engine, surged the most in two years after second-
quarter profit exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Baidu’s American depositary receipts jumped 12 percent to
$119.66 at 10:37 a.m. in New York, heading for the biggest
increase since April 2010.  Second-quarter net income soared 70 percent to 2.77 billion
 yuan  ($436 million), the Beijing-based company said in a
statement after U.S. markets closed yesterday. That surpassed
the  average estimate  of 2.49 billion yuan of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The 5.46 billion yuan sales for the
quarter compared with a 5.47 billion yuan forecast of analysts.  Baidu forecast third-quarter sales will grow as much as 54
percent to 6.41 billion yuan. That compares with a 6.39 billion-
yuan average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg prior
to the earnings announcement.  Strong advertising growth in small businesses “helped
counter macro headwinds with weak ads operating environment,”
Cynthia Meng, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Jefferies Group Inc.,
wrote in research a note today. “Earnings beat both Street and
our estimates.”  Baidu will consider making acquisitions as the company aims
to offer new services to users at a faster pace, Chief Executive
Officer Robin Li said in a conference call with analysts after
the company reported earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
