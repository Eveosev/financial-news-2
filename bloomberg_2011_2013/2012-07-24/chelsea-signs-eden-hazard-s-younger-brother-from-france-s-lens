Thorgan Hazard will join his elder
brother Eden at Chelsea after the European soccer champion
signed him from Lens for an undisclosed fee.  Hazard will join Chelsea’s under-21 squad and may be loaned
out immediately to continue his development, the Premier League
club said in a  statement  on its website late yesterday.  The 19-year-old, who plays a similar range of attacking
positions to his brother, made 14 league appearances for Lens in
the 2011-12 campaign after making his debut as a substitute in
the first match of the season. He represented  Belgium  at the
2011 European Under-19 Championship.  Eden Hazard, a two-time Player of the Year in  France ’s
Ligue 1, joined the Blues last month from Lille for a fee that
U.K. newspapers said was about 40 million euros ($48.3 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
