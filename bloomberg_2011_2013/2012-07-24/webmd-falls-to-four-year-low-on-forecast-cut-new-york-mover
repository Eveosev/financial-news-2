WebMD Health Corp. (WBMD) , the online
provider of medical information, fell to its lowest value in
almost four years after the company said it expected a loss this
year because of advertising cuts by drugmakers.  WebMD dropped 18 percent to $14.65 at the close of New York
trading, its lowest closing price since October 2008. The full-
year loss may be $12.4 million to $23.4 million, the New York-
based company said in a statement today. WebMD on May 1 had
forecast a profit of $2.8 million to $19.9 million.  The company, which gets more than 80 percent of  revenue 
from advertising and sponsorships, said it expects customers to
“re-evaluate expenditures,” including marketing, as they deal
with drug-patent expirations and delays in product approvals.
Chief Executive Officer Cavan Redmond, who took over the spot
last month, said he was looking for “cost efficiencies” across
the company.  “I am reevaluating the company’s infrastructure across-
the-board to drive operational improvements,” Redmond said in
the statement. “The challenges are clear. However, I believe
the opportunities are considerable.”  The shares have fallen 61 percent this year.  WebMD said in a January regulatory filing that it had
broken off talks with potential buyers after concluding that any
offers would be less than its market value. the company was
worth $735.6 million by the close of trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
