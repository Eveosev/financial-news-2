Amerigroup Corp. (AGP) , the government
health-plan manager, agreed to a $4.5 million settlement with
marketing representatives who accused the company of not paying
them overtime, according to a court filing.  The workers asked the court for final approval of a deal
that would include more than 940 current and former  New York 
marketing representatives responsible for signing up eligible
recipients of Medicaid, according to a filing yesterday in
federal court in  Brooklyn , New York.  Amerigroup, which helps states manage health coverage for
the poor, is slated to be acquired for $4.9 billion by  WellPoint
Inc. (WLP) , the second-largest U.S. health insurer, under a deal
announced this month.  “It makes more business sense to stay closer to the line
of the law and to pay people for the many, many hours of
overtime that they work,” Rachel M. Bien, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs, said today in a phone interview.  The case, brought by workers Hamel Toure and Andrea Burch,
accused Virginia Beach, Virginia-based Amerigroup of violating
the federal  Fair Labor Standards Act  and New York labor law by
misclassifying marketing representatives as exempt “outside
salespeople.”  Maureen C. McDonnell, an Amerigroup spokeswoman, and
Kristin Binns of Indianapolis-based WellPoint didn’t immediately
respond to calls seeking comment on the settlement.  The case is Toure v. Amerigroup Corp., 10-cv-05391, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
