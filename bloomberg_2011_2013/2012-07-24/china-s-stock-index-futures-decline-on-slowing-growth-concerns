China’s benchmark stock index  rose
from its lowest level since 2009 as the outlook for  China ’s
manufacturing improved and property developers rallied.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  and Poly Real Estate Group Co. advanced at
least 1.3 percent after the China News Service said Nanjing city
plans to offer loan support for first-home purchases. Kweichow
Moutai Co. rallied 2.8 percent after Haitong Securities Co. said
major liquor makers’ first-half profit may rise as much as 60
percent. A private survey released today by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics signaled the nation’s manufacturing may
contract at a slower pace in July.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.2 percent to 2,146.59
at the close, erasing an earlier loss of as much as 0.5 percent.
The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 0.5 percent to 2,375.99. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, slid 2.1 percent in  New York  yesterday.  “The downtrend on the economy isn’t over yet and earnings
may surprise investors on the downside,” said Wei Wei, an
analyst at West China Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “But the
government may announce measures to boost growth at any time.
Given the recent decline and the policy outlook, a further big
drop isn’t very likely.”  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 13 percent from this
year’s high on March 2 amid concern an economic slowdown is
deepening. It’s valued at 9.6 times estimated profit, compared
with the average of 17.5 since Bloomberg began compiling the
 data  in 2006. Shares worth 48.1 billion  yuan  ($7.54 billion)
changed hands in the index yesterday, the lowest since June 27.  Flash PMI  The July preliminary reading of 49.5 for the purchasing
managers’ index, if confirmed, would be the highest since
February. In June, the final number was 48.2. A final reading
below 50 would also cap a nine-month run, the longest in the
index’s eight-year history and surpassing the stretch from
August 2008 to March 2009.  A measure of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite
added 1.1 percent today, the most among the five industry group.
Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property developer, gained
1.3 percent to 9.33 yuan. Poly Real Estate, the second largest,
advanced 2.1 percent to 11.44 yuan.  China Merchants Property
Development Co. (000024) , the third biggest, climbed 3.4 percent to 23.59
yuan.  Nanjing proposed yesterday to promote the  property market 
by offering housing provident fund loans to first-time
homebuyers and subsidizing purchases by so-called qualified
professionals, China News Service reported yesterday after a
press conference by the local government.  Nanjing isn’t easing home purchase restrictions, according
to a statement posted on the city’s party committee propaganda
department’s microblog. The city will support qualified first-
home purchasers to buy homes, the statement said.  Spirits Makers  The State Council plans to send six teams to inspect the
property markets and lending in 12 provinces as authorities are
“highly concerned” about potential risk, the Shanghai
Securities News reported today, without saying where it got the
information.  Kweichow Moutai, China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor
by market value, led a measure of consumer-staples stocks to the
biggest gain among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups. The stock
rose 2.8 percent to 249.38 yuan.  Wuliangye Yibin, the second biggest, added 0.7 percent to
35.83 yuan.  Luzhou Laojiao Co. (000568) , a sprits producer in southwest
province of Sichuan, climbed 1.9 percent to 41.48 yuan.  European Debts  Kweichow Moutai, Wuliangye and Luzhou Laojiao may report
between 40 percent and 60 percent increases in first-half
profit, Qi Ying, an analyst at Haitong Securities, wrote in a
report today.  In  Europe , Spain’s 10-year bond yields surged to a euro-era
high yesterday on bets more of the nation’s regions will ask for
bailouts. After the market closed, Moody’s Investors Service
said it cut  Germany , the Netherlands’ and Luxembourg’s Aaa
credit rating outlooks to negative, citing “rising
uncertainty” about Europe’s debt crisis.  Risks that  Greece  may exit the 17-nation euro currency and
“increasing likelihood” of collective support for European
countries such as Spain and Italy were among reasons for the
change, Moody’s said yesterday. Europe is China’s largest export
market, making up 18 percent of the nation’s overseas sales,
according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , Asia’s biggest oil
refiner, also known as Sinopec, rose 0.8 percent to 6.07 yuan.  Parent China Petrochemical Corp. agreed to spend $1.5
billion for a 49 percent stake in Calgary-based Talisman Energy
Inc.’s U.K. unit. The purchase was the second announced
yesterday involving a Chinese buyer and a Canadian energy
producer. Hong Kong-listed Cnooc Ltd. agreed to pay $15.1
billion in cash to acquire Calgary-based Nexen Inc.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
