Romania  will reduce the price that
farmers pay for irrigation water by 20 percent and allocate 25
million euros ($30 million) for projects to help offset damage
to crops caused by drought, state television said today.  The government will cut the price by 50 lei per 1,000 cubic
meters of water to 200 lei per 1,000 cubic meters, Bucharest-
based TVR Info said today  on its website , citing Prime Minister
Victor Ponta and the Land Improvement Agency. The drought in
Romania this summer has damaged corn and sunflower crops, mostly
in the south and southeastern regions of the nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
