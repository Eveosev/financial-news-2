International Investment Bank, a
closely held Islamic lender based in Bahrain, plans to sell a
stake in a housing project in  Saudi Arabia ,  Alwasat  reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Aabed al-Zeera.  The bank, which owns 27 percent of the middle-income al-
Fareeda project, in the Red Sea port of  Jeddah , will start
marketing a stake to Saudi investors this year; profit is likely
to improve after the sale, al-Zeera told the newspaper.  The project will have cost 2.2 billion Saudi riyals ($587
million) when completed in 2015, Alwasat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
