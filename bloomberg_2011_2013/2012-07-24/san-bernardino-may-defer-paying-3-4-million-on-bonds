San Bernardino, the third  California 
city to move toward a bankruptcy filing this year, may defer
paying $3.4 million in pension bonds and $2.2 million toward
retiree health care to tide it over before seeking court
protection from creditors.  The city of 209,000 about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of
Los Angeles would defer a total of $6.4 million in payments
under an emergency budget facing a City Council vote today.  Pressured by declines in property taxes and rising employee
costs, as well as accounting irregularities, San Bernardino’s
City Council voted July 10 to seek  bankruptcy protection  and
followed up a week later by declaring a fiscal emergency. That
lets San Bernardino bypass mediation with creditors and go
directly to  bankruptcy court .  “These measures are intended to enable the city to meet
its obligations over a three-month period and will not result in
a sustainable, balanced budget,” interim City Manager Andrea
Travis-Miller and Finance Director Jason Simpson said in a memo
to the council recommending approval.  If the city seeks protection, it would join California’s
Stockton, an agricultural center of 292,000 east of  San
Francisco , and Mammoth Lakes, a mountain resort town of 8,200
south of Yosemite National Park.  To contact the reporter on this story:
