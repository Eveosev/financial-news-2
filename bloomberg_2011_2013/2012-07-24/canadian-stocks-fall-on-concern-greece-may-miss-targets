Canadian  stocks  fell for a third day
as commodities slid on growing speculation that Greece may miss
debt-reduction targets and require more restructuring.  Energy shares and banks contributed the most to the decline
in the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  among 10
industries, while telephone companies rose the most.  Encana (ECA) 
Corp. and  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  fell at least 3.5
percent.  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) , the nation’s largest
wireless carrier, gained 4.8 percent after reporting second-
quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  The S&P/TSX declined 78.59 points, or 0.7 percent, to
11,466.95. The benchmark index advanced as much as 0.3 percent
earlier.  A report from Reuters citing European Union officials said
Greece was seen missing targets for reducing debt. On July 22,
German Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler said it was unlikely
Greece could meet its obligations under a euro-area bailout
program and that he was “very skeptical” European leaders
would be able to rescue the country.  Greece’s international creditors returned to Athens today
to assess how far from bailout terms the country has strayed as
Prime Minister Antonis Samaras pieces together additional budget
cuts that may determine the country’s membership in the euro
area.  Energy provider Encana lost 3.5 percent to C$20.77.
Canadian Natural Resources declined 3.9 percent to C$27.67.
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , the nation’s largest oil company, fell 1.8
percent to C$29.76. The S&P’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw
materials declined for the third day on concerns that the
European debt crisis would cut commodity demand.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the nation’s second-largest lender,
sank 0.8 percent to C$78.43. Bank of  Nova Scotia , the third-
largest lender, dropped 1.2 percent to C$50.77.  Rogers rose 4.8 percent to C$39.01 as job cuts lifted
profitability at the company’s main mobile phone unit. Profit
excluding some items rose 6 cents to 91 Canadian cents a share,
beating the average estimate of 86 cents from 16 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
