OAO Uralkali, the world’s largest
potash producer by output, rose in Moscow trading as it canceled
shares purchased from investors in a buyback announced last
year.  The potash producer gained as much as 1.1 percent to 268
rubles, and was at 266.05 rubles at 10:41 a.m. Uralkali canceled
5.13 percent of stock previously held by units IC Silvinit-
Resurs and JV Kama, which merged with the parent company this
week, it said in a regulatory filing.  Uralkali also expects to merge with another unit, OAO Kama
Mining Co., a move that will complete its reorganization,
today’s filing shows.  Uralkali has spent about $863 million since October buying
shares from the market to support its value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
