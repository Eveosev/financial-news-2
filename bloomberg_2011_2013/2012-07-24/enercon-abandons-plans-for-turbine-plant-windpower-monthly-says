Enercon GmbH, a maker of wind-power
parts, abandoned a 23.1 million euro ($28 million) plan to build
a turbine plant in Galicia,  Spain , Windpower Monthly reported.  The decision followed the country’s suspension of feed-in
tariffs for renewable energy, the report said, citing Juan Ruiz-
Jarabo, head of the company’s Spanish division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
