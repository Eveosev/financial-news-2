Greece ’s government may declare an
amnesty for overdue tax debts, with the aim of collecting
1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) of arrears,  Kathimerini 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  While inspectors from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund, who arrive in Athens today to
assess the country’s compliance with its bailout terms, oppose a
tax amnesty, the state of the country’s finances may compel them
to agree to the measure, according to the newspaper.  The amnesty could cover arrears up to the end of 2011,
Kathimerini said, adding that the Finance Ministry will also
introduce fast-track auditing procedures to clamp down on
evaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
