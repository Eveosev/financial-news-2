Romania’s corn and sunflower crops
may be smaller this year because of drought,  Ziarul Financiar 
 reported,  citing unidentified Agriculture Ministry officials.  The corn harvest will probably drop to 7.5 million metric
tons, the smallest since 2007, from 11.7 million tons in 2011,
while the sunflower crop falls to 1.4 million tons from 1.8
million tons, the Bucharest-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
