Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  and  Bank
Hapoalim Ltd. (POLI)  fell to the lowest levels since 2009 as  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  said the outlook for Israeli banks is worsening amid a
slowing economy and higher  capital requirements .  The  shares  of Leumi, Israel’s largest bank by assets,
retreated 2.2 percent to 8.801 shekels, the lowest since April
2009, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. Hapoalim dropped 2
percent to 10.91 shekels, the lowest since July 2009.  Israel
Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT) , the country’s third-largest bank by assets,
dropped 0.4 percent to 3.695 shekels. The TA-25 benchmark index
advanced 0.9 percent.  “While stocks have already declined significantly in the
last 12 months to reflect weaker operating performance, we don’t
think they are going to rally in the foreseeable future,”
Michael Klahr, an analyst at Citigroup in Tel Aviv, said today
by phone. Klahr downgraded Leumi and Discount to neutral from
buy and maintained Hapoalim at buy.  Economic growth is expected to decelerate to 3.1 percent
this year from 4.8 percent in 2011, the central bank said on
June 25. The economy grew an annualized 2.7 percent in the first
quarter, the slowest pace since 2009.  The central bank is requiring all banks meet higher core
tier 1 requirements by the end of 2014.  “Higher core tier 1  reserve requirements  will mean less
lending and lower dividend payouts, and will weigh on return on
equity,” Klahr wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Leumi has slumped 47 percent in the past 12 months,
compared with a decline of 38 percent in Hapoalim and a 46
percent drop in Discount Bank. The benchmark  TA-25 index  has
fallen 16 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
