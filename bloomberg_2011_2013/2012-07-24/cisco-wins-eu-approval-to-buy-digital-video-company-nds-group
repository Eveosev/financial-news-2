Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the largest
maker of equipment for  computer networks , won European Union
approval to buy digital-video company NDS Group Ltd. in a deal
valued at about $5 billion.  The European Commission said it didn’t see competition
concerns and its investigation showed the combined company
wouldn’t have the ability or incentive to raise costs for
television set-top boxes or pay-TV services, according to an e-
mailed statement today.  Cisco, based in  San Jose , California, is buying NDS to add
software used in next-generation video services in its biggest
acquisition since it bought Scientific-Atlantic Inc. in 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. NDS, which makes
software for pay-TV channels used by British Sky Broadcasting
Corp. and  DirecTV (DTV) , was previously co-owned by  Rupert Murdoch ’s
 News Corp. (NWSA)  and London private-equity firm Permira Advisers LLP.  As part of the purchase, Cisco will get operations in
India, China,  Israel , the U.K. and France as well as about 5,000
NDS employees, who will join Cisco’s video technology business
for service providers. NDS’s products are used to send
interactive content to TV set-top boxes, digital video recorders
and mobile phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
