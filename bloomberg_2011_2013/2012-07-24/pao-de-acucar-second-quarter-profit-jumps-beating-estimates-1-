Grupo Pao  de Acucar,  Brazil ’s biggest retailer,  said profit
more than doubled in the second quarter, benefiting from gains
in the company’s real estate business and beating analysts’
estimates.  Pao de Acucar’s net income attributable to controlling
shareholders was 255 million reais ($125 million) in the
quarter, compared with 91 million reais a year earlier,
according to a regulatory filing sent late yesterday. That
compares with an average  estimate  for adjusted profit of 143.5
million reais among six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net
income excluding the company’s property business rose 75 percent
to 159 million reais, according to a separate filing today.  Brazilian consumers, whose spending has powered economic
growth, have been supported by a strong labor market even as  job
creation  slows. The  unemployment rate  was 5.8 percent in May, a
record low for the month. In the same month, the economy created
139,679 jobs, 45 percent fewer than a year earlier.  Pao de Acucar’s margin on earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization rose to 6.5 percent in the
quarter, from 5.7 percent a year earlier. Sales increased by 6.8
percent to 12 billion reais in the period.  Pao de Acucar yesterday named Christophe Hidalgo as chief
financial officer, according to a regulatory filing. The company
will keep its 1.8 billion reais investment guidance for 2012,
Chief Executive Officer Eneas Pestana said in a call with
investors.  Pao de Acucar’s  shares  fell 2.2 percent to 76.98 reais at
12:27 p.m. in  Sao Paulo  while the benchmark Bovespa index
dropped 0.3 percent.  Billionaire Abilio Diniz handed control of the retailer
founded by his father to Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA on June
22. The transfer stemmed from an agreement signed between the
French retailer and Diniz in 1999 and amended in 2005.  To contact the reporters on this story:
