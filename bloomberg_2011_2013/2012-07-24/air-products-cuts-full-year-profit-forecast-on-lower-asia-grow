Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (APD) , the
world’s largest hydrogen producer, cut its full-year profit
forecast on weaker-than-expected economic growth in  Asia  and
Europe and demand for electronics in its most recent quarter.  Earnings per share are expected to be $5.40 to $5.45 in
2012, the Allentown, Pennsylvania-based company said in a
statement on its website. Air Products had previously predicted
$5.47 to $5.60 for the year.  Profitability at the company’s electronics and performance
materials unit fell 3.1 percentage points in the third quarter
from a year earlier because of pricing pressure, the company
said. Air Products, which saw a slowdown in demand in Asia and
Europe, has cut costs to offset higher energy expenses and a
stronger dollar.  “Economic growth this quarter was below what we expected
in Asia, Europe and Electronics,” Chief Executive Officer John McGlade said in the statement. “Despite headwinds from the
economy and a stronger dollar, we were able to deliver earnings
within expectations due to excellent cost performance.”  Revenue in the third quarter fell 5 percent to $2.34
billion, while operating profit gained 2 percent to $397
million, the company said.  Linde AG (LIN)  of Germany and  Air Liquide SA (AI)  of France will
report earnings on July 27 and 30 respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
