AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, reported sluggish second-quarter sales after signing up
fewer wireless customers, even as the slowdown boosted profit by
lowering smartphone subsidy costs.  Net income attributable to AT&T climbed 8.7 percent to $3.9
billion, or 66 cents a share, from $3.59 billion, or 60 cents, a
year earlier, Dallas-based AT&T said today in a statement.
Analysts projected 63 cents a share on average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose less than 1 percent to
$31.6 billion, compared with an estimate of $31.7 billion.  AT&T added 320,000 monthly contract customers, a smaller
number than a year earlier. While the decline hurt sales growth,
it meant the company doled out fewer dollars in subsidies -- the
payments that make it easier for customers to afford the latest
phones. The lack of a new iPhone from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  contributed to
the lull in subsidy payments, said Joe Bonner, an analyst with
Argus Research in New York.  “It’s all related to the iPhone cycle,” said Bonner, who
has a  hold rating  on AT&T shares. “Margins go up without the
iPhone, and they go down when they have to pay Apple all those
subsidies.”  AT&T shares  fell 2.1 percent to $34.63 at the close in New
York. The stock has climbed 15 percent this year.  New Subscribers  Analysts had estimated 236,182 new subscribers, according
to a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts. The contract-customer
gains lagged behind the 888,000 at  Verizon Wireless , AT&T’s
biggest rival. While AT&T leads in total phone revenue, Verizon
has more wireless customers.  AT&T activated 3.7 million iPhones, compared with the 4.3
million sold in the first quarter. The company also sold 219,000
tablets, a drop from the 240,000 tablets sold in the first
quarter.  Offering smartphones, including the iPhone, takes a toll on
carriers’ profit margins because they typically sell the phones
at a loss to lure subscribers into two-year contracts. Users of
the iPhone and other smartphones are lucrative in the long run
because they spend money more each month to browse the Web, send
e-mail and watch videos.  The carrier will go through a fresh surge of iPhone sales
when the next model comes out, expected later this year.  “This isn’t our first iPhone -- we’ve been through this
before,” AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said in an
interview today.  Upgrade Fees  The company has made some changes to mitigate the crush of
users buying the new model at subsidized prices. It has raised
the upgrade fee for existing customers who want the phone to $36
from $18. AT&T also lengthened the upgrade eligibility period to
20 months, meaning customers have to wait that long to get the
subsidized rate.  “These changes make for a real difference,” Stephens
said. He also reaffirmed his projection for sales of 25 million
smartphones this year, the same as last year.  AT&T’s wireless margins widened to 45 percent last quarter.
That was up from first-quarter margin of 41.6 percent and topped
the 42.2 percent estimate average based on a Bloomberg survey.  AT&T also saw a 1.7 percent rise in the size of wireless
bills, lifted by more people buying data plans. The average
revenue per monthly subscriber increased to $64.93. The average
estimate was $65.04, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Sales from AT&T’s land-line business fell 0.8 percent to
$14.9 billion. The carrier lost 96,000 Internet customers, which
AT&T blamed on seasonal trends. AT&T added 155,000 U-verse
television subscribers, compared with the 200,000 in the first
quarter.  AT&T’s  second-quarter capital spending  totaled $4.48
billion, down 15 percent from $5.27 billion a year earlier. The
company is cutting costs by jettisoning slower-growth
businesses. That includes selling its Yellow Pages directory
unit to Cerberus Capital Management LP in May for $950 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
