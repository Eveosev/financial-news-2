Bahrain’s first sugar-refining plant
is due to start operating early next year, Alwasat newspaper

585,000 metric tons of refined sugar a year, the newspaper said,
citing the bank’s chief executive officer, Aabed al-Zeera.  An agreement has already been signed to sell part of the
plant’s production to a wholesaler in  Saudi Arabia  and
management are in talks with buyers in  Iraq  and other
neighboring Persian Gulf countries, al-Zeera told the daily.  To contact the reporter on this story:
