The decline in China’s growth rate
is a good thing for the country and the world, Peking University
finance professor  Michael Pettis  writes in the Financial Times.  China appears to be heading for a hard landing, and it must
sharply reduce  interest rates  and expand credit to save itself
and the world from disaster, Pettis, a senior associate at the
Carnegie Endowment, writes.  While Chinese rebalancing -- which will involve raising the
consumption contribution to its Gross Domestic Product -- will
mean declining growth and rapidly increasing real interest
rates, instead of “panicking and demanding that Beijing reverse
the process, we should be relieved that China is finally solving
its problems,” he writes.  Fears that slower growth will lead to social dislocation in
China and economic dislocation in the rest of the world will not
be realized if the change is managed well, Pettis writes, noting
that “if Chinese growth slows even to 3 percent, as I expect it
will, but  household income  continues growing at 5-6 percent,
this is far from being socially disruptive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
