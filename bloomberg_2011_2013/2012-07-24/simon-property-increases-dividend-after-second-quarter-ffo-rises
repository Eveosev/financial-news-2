Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , the
largest U.S. shopping-mall owner, raised its dividend and
increased its full-year forecast for funds from operations after
second-quarter FFO climbed 18 percent.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, will be $7.60 to $7.70 a share this year, the
Indianapolis-based real estate investment trust said today in a
statement. That compares with a previous forecast of $7.50 to
$7.60. Simon boosted its  dividend  to $1.05 a share from $1.  Demand for space from retailers at regional malls and
outlet centers is rising, helping to lift Simon’s revenue. The
company also is expanding overseas to increase growth. It bought
a 28.7 percent stake in European shopping-center operator
Klepierre SA for about $2 billion in March and formed a venture
in April with Rio de Janeiro-based  BR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3)  to
develop outlet centers in Brazil.  “Their business is really, really good,”  Rich Moore , an
analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in Solon, Ohio, said by telephone
before the report. “They’re actively engaged on the
international front.”  Second-quarter FFO rose to $688.8 million, or $1.89 a
share, from $583 million, or $1.65, a year earlier, Simon said.
The average of 18  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey was for FFO of
$1.81 a share.  Revenue increased 14 percent to $1.19 billion from $1.04
billion a year earlier. U.S. occupancy climbed to 94.2 percent
from 93.6 percent. The base minimum rent was $39.99 a square
foot in the quarter, up from $38.57 a year earlier. Tenant sales
per square foot rose 10 percent to $554.  The results were released before the start of regular U.S.
trading. Simon fell 0.7 percent to $155.94 yesterday in New
York. Its shares have advanced 21 percent this year, compared
with a 13 percent gain in the Bloomberg  REIT (BBREIT)  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
