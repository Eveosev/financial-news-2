The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond
rose 24 basis points to 6.56 percent, pushing the difference
with similar-maturity German bunds to the highest since Prime
Minister  Mario Monti  took power on Nov. 16.  That  risk premium  widened to 532 basis points, exceeding
the Jan. 9 closing high under Monti. It compares to a euro-era
closing high on Nov. 9 of 552 basis points. It reached 572 basis
points earlier in the day.  “I remember that date very well, because I was in Berlin
and got a call from the head of state who preannounced an
appointment,” Monti told reporters in  Rome  at a Dec. 29 year-
end press conference. He was commenting on a Nov. 9 telephone
call by President Giorgio Napolitano.  Napolitano thay day named Monti as a senator for life, an
honorary position that allows him to vote in the upper house of
the Rome-based Parliament. On Nov. 13, the president asked Monti
to form a new government. He was sworn in as prime minister
three days later to succeed  Silvio Berlusconi .  Italy’s public debt rose in the first quarter to 123.3
percent of gross domestic product, up from 120.1 percent at the
end of 2011, Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics office,
in Luxembourg said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
