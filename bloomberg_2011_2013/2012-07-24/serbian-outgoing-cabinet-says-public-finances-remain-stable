Serbia’s public finances are stable
and the government has enough cash to finance the  budget deficit 
in “the coming months,” the  Finance Ministry  said.  The government has 35 billion dinars ($358.5 million) and
expects an additional inflow of about 10 billion dinars from a
 bond issue  by the end of the month, the Belgrade-based ministry
said in an e-mail today.  “Considering that budget revenue in July has exceeded the
plan, this amount is entirely sufficient to finance the budget
deficit in the coming months,” it said, adding that the full-
year borrowing plan envisaged by the 2012 budget won’t need to
be increased.  Parties that will form the new government of Prime
Minister-Designate Ivica Dacic, to be sworn in later this week,
have said that Serbia’s public finances have deteriorated to
their worst in a decade and that the new Cabinet will have to
take urgent steps to avoid bankruptcy.  Serbian state deposits fell 16.6 percent on the month in
June to the lowest level since November 2010, according to
central bank data released on July 20. Total foreign-currency
and dinar reserves kept on deposit with the National Bank of
Serbia dropped to 100 billion dinars in June from 119.6 billion
dinars in May. The six-month budget gap widened to 111.2 billion
dinars, almost three-quarters of the full-year target.  To contact the reporters on this story:
