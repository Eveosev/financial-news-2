Carmelo Anthony  had 27 points and
the U.S. men’s basketball team defeated host Spain 100-78 to
finish five pre-Olympic exhibitions with a perfect record.  Anthony, of the National Basketball Association’s New York
Knicks, scored 23 of his points in the first half as the
defending Olympic champions won a rematch of the 2008 gold medal
game in Beijing.  LeBron James  of the Miami Heat added 25 points for Team USA
at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona. Pau Gasol of the Los
Angeles Lakers, playing in his hometown, led Spain with 19
points.  “It was a good test for us tonight, but the exhibition
games are over, the friendlies are over and we look forward to
the real challenge of going to London,” James told reporters.  The U.S. opens  preliminary round  play at the London
Olympics on July 29 against France before facing Tunisia,
Nigeria, Lithuania and Argentina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
