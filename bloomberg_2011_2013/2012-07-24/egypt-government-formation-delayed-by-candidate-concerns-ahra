The naming of  Egypt ’s new prime
minister has been delayed due to concerns by prospective
nominees about the responsibilities they would face, the state-
run Al-Ahram newspaper reported, citing the presidency’s
spokesman.  Yasser Ali, spokesman for President Mohamed Mursi, also
denied a report that first appeared on the  Facebook page  of the
Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party saying that a new
premier would be announced on July 26. Ali said the premier, a
technocrat, would be named in the near future, Al-Ahram
reported.  Mursi, who was sworn into office in the end of June, has
vowed to name a national figure to the post in a bid to secure
the broadest support among political groups. His office has so
far dismissed as speculation the various names floated in the
media. Among those reportedly tipped for the job have been the
current central bank head Farouk al-Okdah and former deputy
premier and finance minister Hazem Beblawi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
