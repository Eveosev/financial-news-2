Interserve Plc (IRV) , a U.K. construction
company, said it won a 146 million-pound ($227 million) contract
to build a recycling and renewable energy center with the water
provider Pennon Group’s Viridor unit in  Scotland .  The contract for work expected to start next summer and be
completed in 2016 was announced a day after Viridor said it
secured a 25-year waste treatment services pact with Glasgow for
the recycling and treatment of as much as 200,000 tons of the
Scottish city’s municipal waste annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
