Herve Falciani, a former software
technician at HSBC Holdings Plc’s Swiss private bank who gave
client data to a French prosecutor, was arrested in  Spain ,
 Mediapart  reported in a summary of an article on its website,
without saying where it got the information.  Switzerland  accuses Falciani of stealing data and breaching
banking secrecy, according to the report.  The Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police in Bern
