European stock futures advanced,
indicating the region’s equities will rise following their
biggest two-day drop in eight months, as companies from  Swatch
Group AG (UHR)  to  SAP AG (SAP)  posted sales and profit that climbed. U.S.
index futures and Asian shares were little changed.  Faurecia SA may move after cutting its full-year target
after first-half profit fell.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, a benchmark for the
euro area, increased 0.2 percent to 2,184 at 7:08 a.m. in
 London . Contracts on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index gained 0.4
percent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in
September added 0.1 percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
rose less than 0.1 percent.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slumped 2.5 percent
yesterday, completing its biggest two-day plunge since November,
as concern grew that Greece will default and more Spanish
regions will follow Valencia in seeking a bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
