A euro exit would cost the German
economy more than 3.3 billion euros ($4 billion),  Rheinische
Post  reported, citing Lars Feld, an economist and member of
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of economic advisers.  That doesn’t include the cost of any subsequent economic
slowdown, the newspaper cited Feld as saying in an e-mailed
preview of a story to be published today.  Germany  would suffer a
“wave of insolvencies” and a significant increase in
unemployment amid a euro breakup, with especially severe
consequences for the country’s small and mid-sized privately-
held companies, the newspaper said.  Feld added that Moody’s Investors Service’s decision to
lower the outlook on Germany’s top credit rating was
justifiable, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
