General Electric Co. (GE) , the biggest
U.S. maker of  wind turbines , completed its second wind farm
project in Turkey with Gama Holding AS.  The 10-megawatt Karadag farm in Izmir started generating
electricity this month using four turbines, each with a 2.5-
megawatt capacity, GE, based in Fairfield,  Connecticut , said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Turkey, seeking to get 30 percent of its power from
renewables by 2023, is a “strategic growth area for GE,”
according to the statement.  The nation needs to meet
electricity demand that’s increasing at about 6 percent a year,
Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan said in June.  GE and Ankara-based contractor group Gama, through their
Gama Enerji AS venture, started producing power at their first
wind farm, the 22.5-megawatt Sares facility, in March 2011.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
