Treasuries investors raised bets the
securities will gain in price, becoming the most bullish since
February, according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The proportion of  net longs , or bets the securities will
rise versus those they will fall, increased to 13 percentage
points in the week ending yesterday. The percentage of outright
longs rose to 26 percent from 19 percent.  “There is still ongoing concern around  Europe ,” Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “Positions appear stretched and are too
long. You have to be tactical about the market and, in a world
where positions seem a little too long, a tactical pullback is
likely.”  The percentage of outright shorts, or bets the securities
will fall in value, was unchanged at 13 percent.  Investors cut neutral bets to 60 percent from 68 percent.
Neutrals rose to 74 percent in the week ending June 25, the
highest level of outright neutrals since October.  The yield on the benchmark U.S.  10-year note  rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.44 percent at 8:16 a.m. in
 New York . The yield touched a 2012 high of 2.4 percent on March
20 and reached a record low 1.396 percent yesterday.  JPMorgan doesn’t disclose the number of clients in the
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
