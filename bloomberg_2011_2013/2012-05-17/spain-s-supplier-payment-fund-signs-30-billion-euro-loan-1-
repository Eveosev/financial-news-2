Spain ’s state fund set up to pay
overdue bills to suppliers of city halls and regional
administrations signed a 30 billion-euro ($38 billion)
syndicated loan with 26 banks, the government said.  The financing, which can be increased to as much as 35
billion euros, will allow town halls and regional governments to
refinance debt and for suppliers to recover payments owed, the
economy and budget ministries said today in a statement.  “A solution is being sought for a problem of grand
dimensions during a great credit crisis,” said Rafael Minguez,
a lawyer at Cuatrecasas, Goncalves Pereira who with colleague
Fernando Navarro will head the legal team advising the banks.  Cuatrecasas was chosen through a bidding process to provide
legal advice, according to a statement today by the Spanish law
firm. Minguez said the fund will use a “first-of-its-kind”
mechanism for Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
