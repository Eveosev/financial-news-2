Natixis SA (KN)  has named the Hong Kong-

all activities of the bank globally to make sure risks are
correctly managed and regulations are observed,” Housse said.  Housse will be replaced in his current role by Francois Riahi, deputy chief executive officer for strategy at Groupe
BPCE. Riahi will relocate from Paris to  Hong Kong  in September,
said Housse.  Natixis is the corporate, investment and financial services
