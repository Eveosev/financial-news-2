Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the
nation’s biggest bank by market value, said third-quarter profit
rose 2.9 percent as charges for bad debts fell.  Unaudited cash earnings in the three months ended March 31
climbed to A$1.75 billion ($1.74 billion), the Sydney-based bank
said in a statement today, compared with the A$1.7 billion it
reported for the same period in 2011. Impairment expenses fell
to A$232 million, or 0.18 percent of total average loans.  Chief Executive Officer Ian Narev, who took over from  Ralph Norris  in December, is battling to maintain a lead in mortgages
as demand for home loans wanes to the weakest since 1977. Rising
wholesale funding and deposit costs are cutting the
profitability of lending for the nation’s biggest banks even as
the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  lowers the developed world’s
highest benchmark interest rate.  “Subdued credit demand and elevated funding costs
continued to impact on revenue growth,” Commonwealth Bank said
in the statement. “Higher funding costs had a further negative
impact” on net interest margins, the bank said, without
providing figures.  Shares (CBA)  of Commonwealth Bank fell 0.7 percent to A$51.43 as
of 10:18 a.m. in Sydney. The benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 index  rose
0.2 percent.  Commonwealth Bank increased its market share in business
lending, while conditions in retail banking “remained
challenging,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
