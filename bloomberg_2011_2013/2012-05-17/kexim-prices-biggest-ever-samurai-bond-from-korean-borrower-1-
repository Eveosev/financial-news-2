Export-Import Bank of  Korea  sold 100
billion yen ($1.2 billion) of Samurai bonds, a record offering
of such notes from a Korean borrower.  The sale includes 51.4 billion yen of 1.11 percent two-year
bonds priced to yield 70 basis points more than the yen swap
rate and 41.2 billion yen of 1.25 percent notes due in three
years yielding 83 basis points more than the benchmark,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The state-owned lender
known as Kexim also offered 7.4 billion yen of 1.38 percent
Samurai notes due 2017 at a spread of 90 basis points.  Samurai bonds, as securities sold in  Japan  by foreign
issuers are known, are attracting investors seeking higher
returns after the yield on benchmark 10-year government debt
tumbled yesterday to match the  lowest  since 2003. Bond buyers
are favoring notes sold by issuers that aren’t from the U.S. or
Europe after government-formation talks by Greek leaders
collapsed and JPMorgan Chase & Co. disclosed a $2 billion
trading loss, according to Nomura Securities Co.  “Many investors seem to have bought the Kexim Samurai
after a process of elimination,” Kyoko Kaji, a Tokyo-based
credit analyst at Nomura, said in a telephone interview today.
“Most U.S. and European borrowers are not in a position to sell
new Samurai bonds in the current environment.”  Kexim doubled its sale amount from 50 billion yen “because
of high demand,” according to a statement from the lender
today.  The deal is the biggest-ever Samurai bond offering from a
Korean borrower, breaking the record set by Kexim when it sold
80 billion yen of Samurai debt in June, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  That sale included 58.4 billion yen of 0.93 percent two-
year securities priced to yield 50 basis points more than the
yen swap rate, 20 basis points less than the similar-maturity
notes that Kexim sold today, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
