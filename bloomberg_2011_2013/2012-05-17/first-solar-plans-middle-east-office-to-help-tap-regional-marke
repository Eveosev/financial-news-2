First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest maker
of thin-film solar panels, plans to open an office in the  United
Arab Emirates  this year to tap growing demand for power in the
Middle East.  The company is in talks with potential partners to help win
contracts and is considering opening a manufacturing plant in
the region, Karim Asali, technical development manager, said
today in a telephone interview from  Abu Dhabi . First Solar said
last month it is cutting about 30 percent of its workforce as
demand in Europe slows.  Solar companies are seeking to expand in the Middle East as
Saudi Arabia and its neighbors diversify power sources. Saudi
Arabia is planning to add 41 gigawatts of solar power over the
next two decades, according to officials at the agency
developing the plan.  “Saudi Arabia is clearly the biggest solar market in the
 Middle East ,” Asali said. “This is the first time we’ve seen
numbers for solar power developments on the gigawatt scale in
this region,” he said, referring to the Saudi plan.  Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Jordan will probably have 2 to
3 gigawatts of facilities under development in the next two to
three years, he said. Completing the plants will take another
year or more.  The Tempe, Arizona-based company, which built a 5 megawatt
solar plant for Abu Dhabi’s renewable energy venture Masdar,
will focus on developing utility-size solar plants, as it does
in the U.S., Asali said. First Solar’s thin-film technology
competes with polysilicon panels that are made mostly in  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
