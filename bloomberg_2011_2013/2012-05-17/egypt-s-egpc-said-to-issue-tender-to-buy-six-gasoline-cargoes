Egyptian General Petroleum Corp., the
state-owned  oil company , issued a tender to buy six gasoline
cargoes, according to two traders with knowledge of the matter.  EGPC is seeking to purchase as much as 198,000 metric tons
of  gasoline  for delivery to Alexandria from July to September,
said the traders, declining to be identified because the
information is confidential. The tender closes on June 5 and is
valid until June 22.  Nobody answered a phone call today to EGPC’s office in
Cairo. The Egyptian refiner also tendered to buy 36 cargoes of
gasoil to be delivered over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
