Taiwan ’s dollar rebounded from a
three-month low on speculation exporters took advantage of a
relatively favorable  exchange rate  to repatriate income.
Government bonds dropped.  The U.S. dollar’s 14-day relative-strength index against
the local currency reached 67 yesterday, approaching the
threshold of 70 that signals the greenback will probably reverse
gains. Global funds bought $23.1 million more Taiwanese stocks
than they sold today, after eight days of net sales, according
to exchange data.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to NT$29.56
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.640 earlier, the weakest level since Feb. 2.  “Exporters’ money is countering massive outflows from
foreign investors,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-exchange
trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “The NT$29.6 level is
good for exporters to sell the greenback.”  One-month implied volatility for the currency, a measure of
exchange-rate swings traders use to price options, dropped 14
basis points to 5.59 percent. It touched a four-month high of
5.88 percent yesterday.  The Taiex index of shares rallied after the  Federal Reserve 
said slowing economic growth in the U.S. could warrant
additional stimulus measures.  Taiwan will report on May 21 that export orders increased
0.5 percent in April from a year earlier after a 1.58 percent
contraction the previous month, according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The yield on the 1 percent  government bonds  due January
2017 rose to 0.965 percent from 0.961 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank
lending rate  was little changed at 0.508 percent, according to a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.
It closed at 0.514 percent on three consecutive days to May 11,
the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
