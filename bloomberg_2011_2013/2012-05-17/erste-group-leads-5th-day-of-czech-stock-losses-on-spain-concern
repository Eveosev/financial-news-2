Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  of Austria fell,
leading the fifth day of declines for Czech shares, as Europe’s
debt crisis worsened, driving investors from riskier assets.  The stock dropped 3.4 percent to 365 koruna by 4:09 p.m. in
Prague, headed for its lowest close in four months. The PX index
of 14 companies, where Erste has an 18 percent weighting, slid
0.6 percent to 870.30, poised for a five-month low.  Lenders were among the biggest stock decliners across
Europe after the European Central Bank suspended lending to some
Greek banks and a report indicated Spanish banks may be
downgraded today. Spain’s borrowing costs rose at a sale today,
adding to speculation the region’s debt crisis will not be
contained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
