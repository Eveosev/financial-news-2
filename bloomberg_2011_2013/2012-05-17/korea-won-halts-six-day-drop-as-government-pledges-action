South Korea’s won advanced for the
first time in seven days as the government signaled it may
intervene to calm the market amid concerns the  European debt
crisis  is deteriorating.  Government bonds  held steady.  South Korea has enough foreign reserves to cope with the
Greek crisis and will take “prompt” action on markets if
needed, Vice Finance Minister Shin Je Yoon said at an emergency
meeting today before markets opened.  European Central Bank  said
yesterday it will temporarily stop lending to some Greek banks
to limit risks, as the nation heads toward a new election with
its euro membership at stake. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of shares rose
even as foreign investors cut holdings for a 12th day.  “The won had a technical rebound after falling much in a
short period, and there was also caution against government
intervention,” said Lee Jin Ill, a Seoul-based currency trader
at Hana Bank. “Still, with overseas funds continuing to sell
Korean stocks, it’s difficult to say the financial market
distress has eased.”  The won climbed 0.2 percent to 1,163.00 per dollar in
 Seoul , after declining 2.6 percent in the last six days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
1,165.60 yesterday, the weakest level since Jan. 9. One-month
implied volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, slid 90 basis points, or 0.9
percentage point, 10.53 percent.  The yield on  South Korea ’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 was little changed at 3.40 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. Three-year debt futures slid 0.05 to 104.43 and the
one-year interest-rate swap advanced two basis points to 3.39
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
