The Federal Reserve Bank of  New
York â€™s survey of primary dealers conducted before policy makers
met last month showed that the firms predicted the central bank
would begin raising interest rates in the third quarter of 2014.  The timing was based on the median response of primary
dealers received the survey on April 12 and released today by
the New York Fed. There are 21 primary dealers that trade
directly with the Fed.  The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  at its
April 24-25 meeting renewed a pledge to keep its main  interest
rate  low until at least late 2014. Several policy makers said a
loss of momentum in growth or increased risks to their outlook
could warrant additional action, according to minutes of the
meeting released yesterday.  Several dealers said that further easing is still possible,
with a few expecting such action as early as June, the survey
results showed. Several respondents said asset purchases would
be the most likely option if the Fed were to increase stimulus,
according to the report.  The Fed has kept its  benchmark rate  near zero since
December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
