The  Portuguese government   approved
measures to reduce the costs of the country’s electricity system
as it complies with the terms of a financial aid program.  The government is cutting the cost of subsidies and other
payments to the industry by about 1.8 billion euros ($2.3
billion) through 2020, Economy Minister Alvaro Santos Pereira
said today at a press conference in Lisbon. Guaranteed capacity
payments will be reduced alongside costs of cogeneration,
renewable energy and the system that replaced long-term power
purchase agreements, Santos Pereira said.  “All producers will contribute to the necessary effort to
resume the path of sustainability for the electricity sector,”
the minister said.  EDP-Energias de Portugal SA  is Portugal’s biggest
electricity company and other power generators include  Endesa SA (ELE) 
and  International Power Plc (IPR) , according to energy grid operator
 REN-Redes Energeticas Nacionais SA. (RENE)   The International Monetary Fund and the European Union,
which are providing financial aid to Portugal, said Feb. 28 that
the pace of structural reforms must be “stepped up.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
