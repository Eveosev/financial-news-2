Resona Holdings Inc. (8308) , the Japanese
bank that was bailed out in 2003 with 1.96 trillion yen ($24
billion), plans to pay back most of the money still owed to
taxpayers earlier than scheduled after profit reserves grew.  “We’ve built retained earnings and are not going to sell
new shares,” Resona President Seiji Higaki, 60, said in an
interview in Tokyo on May 16. The bank will purchase 450 billion
yen of the government’s preferred shares earlier than the
current target of late 2015, he said.  Taxpayers have injected 3.1 trillion yen into Resona since
1999, when  Japan ’s banks were saddled with bad loans after an
 asset bubble  burst, and the Tokyo-based lender still owes 872
billion yen. Resona has turned itself around since the 2003
bailout, posting  profit  in the past eight fiscal years by
focusing on lending to retail customers.  “Our core business is retail banking, and what we need the
most is to expand the number of household and corporate
clients,” said Higaki, who took the post in 2007 to join
Chairman Eiji Hosoya in overseeing the bank’s revival.  Resona, Japan’s fifth-biggest bank by market value, is more
profitable than larger rivals led by  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306)  because it targets mortgages and small-business loans
that carry higher interest rates, said Shinichiro Nakamura, a
Tokyo-based analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  “The bank will keep its focus on high-yielding lending
such as mortgages and loans for smaller enterprises rather than
large companies,” Nakamura said.  Profit Growth  Net interest margin  at Resona stood at 1.22 percent in
March, compared with 1.04 percent for Mitsubishi UFJ, the
country’s biggest bank, and 0.78 percent for  Mizuho Financial
Group Inc. (8411) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Resona’s  net income  climbed 59 percent to 253.7 billion yen
in the year ended March as provisions for soured loans fell,
according to statements released last week. The bank forecast
profit will drop 45 percent to 140 billion yen in the current
year in anticipation of credit costs rising as government relief
on loan repayments for small businesses expires.  Shares of the lender have declined 9.7 percent this year,
underperforming the 84-stock  Topix Banks Index (TPNBNK) , which advanced
3.4 percent.  Higaki wants to move the debt repayment schedule forward by
using  retained earnings  built up over the past year, he said,
without disclosing a new timeline. Resona increased the portion
of profit that’s reinvested rather than paid to stockholders by
24 percent last fiscal year to 1.09 trillion yen as of March 31.  “We may split the purchase of the 450 billion yen of
preferred stock into several portions, depending on how fast and
how much we build reserves in the next four years,” Higaki said.  Resona sold 545 billion yen of new shares in January 2011
as part of Chairman Hosoya’s goal to buy 1.3 trillion yen of
preferred shares from the government by 2015. The bank has
purchased about 800 billion yen of the stock since the target
was unveiled in November 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
