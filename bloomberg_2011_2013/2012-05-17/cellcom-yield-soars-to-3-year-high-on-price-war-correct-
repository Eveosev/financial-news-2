(Corrects time stamp in second paragraph.)  Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL) ’s bond yield
soared to the highest in more than three years on bets growing
competition on prices would hurt profitability at the nation’s
biggest mobile-phone company.  The yield on Cellcom’s 5.19 percent shekel-denominated
notes due July 2017 rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
points, to 4.71 percent, the highest since January 2009, at the
4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The yield soared 184 basis points
this week. Shares of the Netanya, Israel-based company slumped
for a fifth day, falling 4.7 percent to 32.5 shekels, the lowest
close since the shares were listed in Tel Aviv in July 2007. The
yield on  Partner Communications Co. (PTNR) ’s 3.4 percent bonds maturing
November 2016 jumped 36 basis points to 4.17 percent, the
highest since August.  Partner,  Israel ’s second-largest mobile-phone provider,
Cellcom and  Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp. (BEZQ)  are facing new
competition after  Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT)  and Golan
Telecom Ltd. started offering wireless services on May 14.  “New entrants in the sector offering cheaper packages is
likely to force Cellcom and other service providers to cut
prices which will in turn hurt their profitability,” said
Avihay Hermon, a bond trader at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in
Tel Aviv. “There are also growing concerns in the market that
these companies may have their debt ratings downgraded.”  Cellcom’s first-quarter net income  plunged 43 percent  to
173 million shekels ($45 million) as revenue declined, the
company said this week. In addition, Cellcom and Partner will be
moved from the MSCI’s Israel Index to a gauge for smaller stocks
after the market closes on May 31. Their shares have plunged 70
percent and 67 percent, respectively, in the past year,
outpacing the 16 percent drop in the benchmark  TA-25 Index. (TA-25)   The Tel-Bond 40 Index, a measure of inflation-linked and
fixed-rate corporate bonds, dropped 0.4 percent to 261.43, the
lowest close since Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
