The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars weakened against the yen as stocks dropped and concern
increased the euro-zone debt crisis is escalating, damping
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The South Pacific nations’ currencies slumped after  Spain ’s
borrowing costs rose at an auction, increasing bets that the
region’s financial contagion is spreading from  Greece . The
currencies rose against the  U.S. dollar  on speculation recent
declines were overdone.  Australia’s dollar dropped 1.3 percent to 78.39 yen
yesterday in New York and reached 78.37, the lowest level since
Jan. 9. The Aussie weakened 0.3 percent to 98.88 U.S. cents,
extending its drop this month to 5.2 percent.  The kiwi, as New Zealand’s dollar is known, weakened 1.5
percent to 60.51 yen, falling to 60.48, the lowest since Jan.
10. The currency declined 0.1 percent to 76.33 U.S. cents,
adding to a 6.8 percent drop this month.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  fell 1.5 percent, extending
its losing streak to five days.  Spain sold bonds due in January 2015 at an average yield of
4.375 percent, compared with 2.89 percent when they were last
auctioned in April. Investors bought bonds maturing in July 2015
at 4.876 percent, compared with 4.037 percent on May 3 and bonds
due April 2016 at 5.106 percent.  The cost of insuring against a Spanish default rose to a
record, with credit-default swaps on the nation’s bonds jumping
13 basis points to a record 553, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Borrowing costs in Europe’s most-indebted nations are
rising amid speculation that Greece will leave the 17-nation
euro area as political parties opposed to the terms of two
international bailouts polled strongly. A fresh vote has been
set for June 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
