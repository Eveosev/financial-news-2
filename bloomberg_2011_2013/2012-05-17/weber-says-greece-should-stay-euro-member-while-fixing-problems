UBS AG (UBSN)  Chairman and former European
Central Bank Governing Council member  Axel Weber  said Greece
should solve its fiscal problems within the borders of the euro
region.  “If I look at the euro, it’s a one-way system,” Weber
said in a panel discussion in Frankfurt late last night. While
solving the problems “within the borders” of the euro area
means choosing the “hard way,” it will “probably be the best
way,” he said.  Greek lawmakers failed to form a government after
inconclusive elections earlier this month, fueling speculation
about an exit of the country from the euro. The ECB said today
that it cut some Greek banks off from refinancing operations
until they are recapitalized, forcing them to tap the Emergency
Liquidity Assistance program provided by the Greek central bank.  “The euro and any discussion about this not being a one-
way arrangement will just lead to another genie-out-of-the-
bottle debate,” Weber said. “When the markets start pricing
that genie-out-of-the-bottle effect it just produces more
repercussions,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
