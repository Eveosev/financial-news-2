China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , the
country’s largest ship owner, is seeking permission to resume
freight derivatives trading three years after settling losses of
at least $166.7 million.  The Chinese government hasn’t allowed state-controlled
shipping companies including Cosco to trade the contracts since
a market slump in 2008 led to “widespread losses,”  Jeremy
Penn , chief executive officer of the  Baltic Exchange , said at a
conference in  London  on May 15. Cosco is in talks about trading
freight derivatives, the company said yesterday in an e-mailed
response to questions.  The derivatives, called forward freight agreements, or
FFAs, are used to bet on the future price of carrying minerals
and grains, and settled against indexes of shipping costs
published by the London-based exchange. Vessel operators use the
trades as a risk management tool to lock in future hiring costs
in case they rise.  “A number of Chinese companies were heavily engaged in the
FFA market in the buildup to the 2008 collapse and that caused
quite a lot of political fallout,” Penn said.  Cosco said in December 2008 that it might lose 3.95 billion
 yuan  ($577 million) from wrong-way bets on freight rates after
shipping costs plunged as much as 94 percent. FFA losses in
2009’s first quarter were $166.7 million, the company said in a
preliminary quarterly filing on April 29, 2010.  The Chinese government’s State Owned Administrative
Enterprise Committee authorizes trading in FFAs and that’s not
being granted at the moment, according to Penn.  International Marketplace  “We understand that Cosco and a number of other major
shipping firms are back talking to the committee and discussing
the ways in which they might come back into that international
marketplace,” he said.  The return of  Chinese shipping firms  may boost volumes
which plunged 46 percent in 2009 after dry-bulk rates slid in
late 2008,  Baltic Exchange  data show. Volumes peaked at 2.1
million lots in 2008, falling to 1.2 million in 2009, and 1
million in 2011, according to the exchange. Each lot represents
1,000 metric tons of freight or one day’s average time charter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
