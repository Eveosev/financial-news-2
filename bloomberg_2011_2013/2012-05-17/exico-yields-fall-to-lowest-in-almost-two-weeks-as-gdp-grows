Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds dropped
to their lowest level in almost two weeks as gross domestic
product growth accelerated in the first quarter and the central
bank raised its forecast for expansion in  Latin America ’s
second-biggest economy.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in December
2014 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.77
percent at 1:03 p.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It’s the lowest on a closing basis since May 4.  Mexico’s debt rallied after the national statistics agency
reported today that the economy expanded 4.6 percent during the
first quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2010.
 Banco de Mexico  boosted yesterday its estimate for economic
expansion to a range of 3.25 percent to 4.25 percent from its
prior projection of 3 percent to 4 percent.  “The growth story is indeed a key driver,” Aryam Vazquez,
an economist for global  emerging markets  at  Wells Fargo & Co .,
said in a phone interview from  New York . “Authorities are
affirming that inflation is not a threat.”  In addition to boosting its growth forecast as part of its
quarterly inflation report yesterday, policy makers signaled
that risks of faster consumer price increases have diminished.
Annual inflation slowed last month to 3.41 percent, the lowest
level among major economies in Latin America. Banco de Mexico
has left the target lending rate at a record low 4.5 percent
since July 2009.  The peso depreciated 0.1 percent to 13.7860 per dollar
today. It has dropped 5.6 percent in May, the most among major
Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
