A Greek exit from the euro would be
“controllable” though expensive,  Handelsblatt  cited Rainer Bruederle, floor chief of the Free Democratic Party, as saying.  “Unlike two years ago, the  euro zone  would be rather able
to cope with a Greek exit,” the newspaper quoted Bruederle as
saying, according to the e-mailed preview of an article to be
published tomorrow.  Bruederle rejected concessions to win support from the
opposition Social Democrats for the European Stability
Mechanism, Handelsblatt reported. “We are not at a bazaar,”
the newspaper quoted him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
