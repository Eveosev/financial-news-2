Light Louisiana Sweet oil’s  premium 
to the Mars Blend grade narrowed to the smallest since August
before shipments of oil on the Seaway pipeline and on
speculation of a release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves.  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  will
start moving oil on the Seaway pipeline from Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
to Houston-area refineries this weekend, the companies said
today. The U.S. has called on other Group of Eight nations to
prepare to release strategic oil reserves because of the full
implementation of the European Union’s ban on imports from  Iran 
starting July, the Kyodo news service reported. The  news agency 
cited unidentified officials familiar with Japan-U.S. ties.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to Mars narrowed 20 cents
to $1.15 a barrel at 2:10 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the smallest margin since Aug. 25.
LLS’s premium to West Texas Intermediate weakened 35 cents to
$12, the smallest since Jan. 31.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI decreased $1.50 to
$14.50. Mars Blend’s narrowed 15 cents to $10.85 a barrel and
Poseidon’s lost 40 cents to $9.60. Southern Green Canyon’s
premium added 10 cents to $9.85.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 80 cents
against WTI to a premium of $13.55.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI widened 85 cents to
$16.25 a barrel. Syncrude’s premium lost 10 cents to $1.90.  Bakken oil’s discount to the U.S. benchmark was unchanged
at $2 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
