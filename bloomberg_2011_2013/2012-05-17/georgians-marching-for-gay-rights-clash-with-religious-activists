Georgians rallying in support of gay
rights clashed with religious activists, disrupting a march
through the streets of the Black Sea nationâ€™s capital, Tbilisi.  As many as 50 people turned out, some with posters and
painted faces, Guram Demetrashvili, a participant, told
reporters at the scene today. Dozens of activists led by Father
David Isakadze, an Orthodox Christian priest, pushed and kicked
them and broke their placards as they blocked their path,
according to Demetrashvili.  No-one was injured during the clash, Zurab Gvenetadze, a
spokesman for the  Interior Ministry , said by phone. Some people
were detained for a short time before being released, he added.  The Gender Equality and Human Rights movement, which
organized the rally, was founded in 2010 to research hate crimes
and comments against minorities, according to its Facebook Inc.
 page . Christianity has been a state religion in parts of  Georgia 
since the fourth century and is the dominant religion in the
nation of 4.4 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
