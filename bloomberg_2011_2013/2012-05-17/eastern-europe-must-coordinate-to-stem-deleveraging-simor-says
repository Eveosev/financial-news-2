Central and eastern European
regulators need closer coordination to stem deleveraging by
foreign banks and avoid a credit crunch threatening some
countries, Hungarian central bank President Andras Simor said.  “European bank deleveraging -- although to different
degrees -- is clearly a serious risk for CEE countries,” Simor
said in a speech in  London  today. “A disproportionately high
degree of deleveraging in” the region “can have large effects
on the region’s credit supply and may hamper the recovery
process. Regulatory vigilance is therefore justified and,
importantly, has to occur in a coordinated fashion.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
