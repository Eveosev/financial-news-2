Singapore ’s exports rose more than
economists estimated in April as manufacturers shipped more
petrochemicals and sales to  China  rebounded.  Non-oil domestic  exports  rose 8.3 percent from a year
earlier, after a 4.3 percent decline in March, the trade
promotion agency said in a statement today. The median of 16
estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey  was for a 5.9 percent gain.  Exports climbed a seasonally adjusted 13.1 percent last
month from March, when they fell 16.8 percent, today’s report
showed. The median of eight estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 5.7 percent increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
