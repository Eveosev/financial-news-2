Yuan  forwards strengthened,
rebounding from a four-month low, on speculation policies to
stimulate  China ’s domestic demand will help the world’s second-
largest economy withstand  Europe ’s debt crisis.  China will lower lenders’ reserve requirements tomorrow for
the third time since November, freeing up cash for lending amid
a slowdown. Gross domestic product increased 8.1 percent from a
year earlier in the first quarter, the smallest gain since 2009,
and growth is forecast to bottom at 8.0 percent this quarter
before accelerating to 8.3 percent in the third quarter, based
on the median estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.17 percent
to 6.3817 per dollar in Shanghai, after falling 0.30 percent
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yuan
fell 0.05 percent to 6.3252 in  Shanghai , according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The forwards traded at a 0.9
percent discount to the spot rate.  “There was quite a big move yesterday and there’s some
pullback today,” said Sean Yokota, a Singapore-based currency
strategist at UBS AG. “Growth will be above 8 percent and is
nowhere close to a hard landing. We still think the yuan will
appreciate by year-end.”  Fears of a “hard landing” are overdone, Standard
Chartered Plc analysts Wei Li and  Robert Minikin  wrote in a note
to clients today. The economy is forecast to expand 8.3 percent
this year, which would be the slowest since 2001, a Bloomberg
survey shows.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s reference rate
0.04 percent lower at 6.3233 per dollar, weakening the fixing
for a seventh day, the longest run of declines since May 2010.
The currency is allowed to trade 1 percent either side of the
reference rate. In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan was
little changed at 6.3247.  To contact the reporter on this story:
