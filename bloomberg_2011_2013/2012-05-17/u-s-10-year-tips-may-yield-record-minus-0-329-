The government’s $13 billion sale of
10-year inflation-indexed securities may draw a record low yield
of negative 0.329 percent, according to the average forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21
primary dealers.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities mature in
January 2022. They yielded negative 0.37 percent in trading
before the auction. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York  time.  The last offering of 10-year TIPS, a $13 billion sale on
March 22, drew a record low yield of negative 0.089 percent, the
second time an auction of the maturity yielded less than zero.  TIPS pay interest at lower rates than nominal Treasuries on
a principal amount that’s linked to the Labor Department’s
consumer price index.  The March sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.81,
versus 2.91 at the previous auction in January and an average of
2.73 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 40.4 percent of the securities at
the March auction, compared with 36.3 percent at the January
sale. The average for the past 10 offerings is 40.3 percent.  Direct Bidders  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 21.1 percent of
the notes at the last sale, versus 13.4 percent in January and
an average of 11.4 percent at the past 10 auctions.  U.S. inflation-linked debt maturing in 10 or more years has
returned 5.12 percent this year, compared with a 3.54 percent
gain in the broader TIPS market and a 1.07 percent gain in the
overall Treasury market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes
show.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The auction is the Treasury’s only offering of notes or
bonds this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
