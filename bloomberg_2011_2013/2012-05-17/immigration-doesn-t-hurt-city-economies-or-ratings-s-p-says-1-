Most U.S. cities with “significant
immigration” over the past decade saw their credit ratings
improve, according to  Standard & Poor’s .  Even amid concerns about the pressures of new, lower-income
or less-educated residents, cities with high numbers of the
foreign born saw tax bases grow and per-capita income increase,
the report released today by the ratings company said.  “To make a case that immigration causes governments to go
broke or jurisdictions to have budget overruns is a simplistic
argument,” said Horacio Aldrete-Sanchez, a senior director in
state and local government ratings for S&P and an author of the
report. “There are undoubtedly costs to these governments, but
there is also an overall increase in economic activity and a
stabilizing impact on the labor markets.”  The company looked at cities where immigrants fueled
 population growth  from 2000 to 2010 as well as cities where
rapid population growth was primarily due to domestic migration.  The analysts found that while it is difficult to isolate
the impact of immigration on local governments, it has not
resulted in the deterioration of city economies or financial
standings. No city has had its municipal credit rating
downgraded because of the burden of immigration, Aldrete-Sanchez
said.  “Regardless of whether foreign immigration or domestic
migration, as long as there is population growth that seems to
be the one factor that drives economic activity,” Aldrete-
Sanchez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
