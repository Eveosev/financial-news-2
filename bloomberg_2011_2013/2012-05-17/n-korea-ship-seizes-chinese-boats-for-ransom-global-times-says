A North Korean ship seized three
Chinese boats with 29 fishermen aboard and demanded more than
$140,000 to release them,  China ’s Global Times newspaper
reported today.  The fishing boats were captured at gunpoint while trawling
in Chinese waters on May 8, the newspaper said, citing an owner
of one of the boats, identified as Zhang Dechang. He said the
captors were demanding 300,000  yuan  ($47,500) to release each
vessel.  China is in contact with North Korea to verify what
happened and resolve the issue, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong
Lei said at a briefing in Beijing today. A standoff could strain
ties between North Korea and China, its main  financial  and
diplomatic backer.  “China hopes to appropriately solve the issue as soon as
possible and we have made it clear to  North Korea  that the
legitimate rights of the Chinese fishermen need to be ensured,”
Hong said.  The fishermen were taken to North Korean waters after they
were seized, CCTV reported. Officials in the Chinese province of
Dalian have gotten involved and the captors didn’t appear at an
agreed-upon May 12 meeting, the Global Times said, citing a
Dalian marine police squad staff officer with the last name Yu.  It wasn’t clear if the captors were with the North Korean
government or “just a group of kidnappers,” the Global Times
said, citing Yu.  South Korea  is aware of Chinese media reports
about the incident, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Han Hye Jin
said today in  Seoul . She said it wasn’t appropriate for the
government to comment.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
