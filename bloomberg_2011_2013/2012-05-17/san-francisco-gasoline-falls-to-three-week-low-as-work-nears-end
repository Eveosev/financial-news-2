California-blend gasoline in  San
Francisco  tumbled to the lowest level against futures in three
weeks as seasonal refinery work neared completion and the state
Energy Commission said total supplies climbed last week.  Inventories rose 3.8 percent in the week ended May 11 to
5.67 million barrels after refineries boosted production of  non-
California-blend fuel , the state said yesterday.  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  finished work at the 158,000-barrel-a-day Martinez
plant, and  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  reported two equipment startups at the
170,000-barrel-a-day Golden Eagle plant last week, notices to
county regulators showed.  Carbob in San Francisco dropped for a fifth day, declining
8 cents to a premium of 15 cents a gallon above gasoline futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:25 p.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the
narrowest premium for the fuel since April 25.  BP Plc (BP/)  was scheduled to return a crude unit to service at
the 266,000-barrel-a-day Cherry Point refinery in Washington
state this week, a person familiar with operations there said
May 15.  Los Angeles  Carbob fell 4.5 cents to a 23-cent premium
against gasoline futures, the lowest since April 30.  CARB diesel in Los Angeles was unchanged at 7.5 cents a
gallon above Nymex heating oil futures. The same fuel in San
Francisco slipped 0.5 cent to a 7.5-cent premium to futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
weakened 2.5 cents to a 57.5-cent premium versus gasoline
futures. Low-sulfur diesel  there  dropped 5.5 cents to 31 cents a
gallon above heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
