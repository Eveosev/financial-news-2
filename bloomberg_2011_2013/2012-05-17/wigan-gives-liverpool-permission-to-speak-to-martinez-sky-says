Wigan has given Liverpool permission
to speak to  Roberto Martinez  about its vacant manager’s job,
Latics chairman Dave Whelan told Sky Sports News.  Liverpool is looking to replace  Kenny Dalglish , who was
fired yesterday.  “I thought Liverpool would be knocking on the door and
sure enough they are,” Whelan told Sky Sports News. “I gave
them permission and he will be talking to them soon.”  Martinez just completed his third season at Wigan. The
Latics finished 15th in the 20-team league, seven points above
the relegation zone after winning five of their final six
matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
