Japanese and Australian stock futures
fell, indicating benchmark gauges will extend this week’s
losses, amid increasing concern that Greece will exit the euro
and after disappointing economic data in the U.S.  American depositary receipts of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s largest mining company, fell 2 percent from the closing
share price in Sydney as investors sold stocks with profits tied
to economic growth. ADRs of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese camera maker
that depends on Europe for almost a third of its sales, lost 2
percent. Those of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest consumer
electronics exporter, declined 2.7 percent.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 8,680 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,850 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,690 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 1.8 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid
0.6 percent in Wellington.  “If policy makers don’t step in, the costs will be even
higher to find a real solution in  Europe ,” said Diane Lin, a
fund manager who helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana
Capital Ltd. in Sydney. “We remain very cautious. The
politicians have still not got the message.”  More than $3 trillion has been erased from the value of
equities worldwide this month as concern Greece will exit the
euro curbed demand for riskier assets. The country faces another
election on June 17 that may boost parties opposed to the
conditions of its international bailouts.  Ratings Cut  Greece’s credit rating was downgraded one level by  Fitch
Ratings  on concerns the country won’t be able to muster the
political support needed to sustain its membership in the euro
area.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  was among 16 Spanish banks whose credit
ratings were cut by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited
economic weakness and the government’s mounting budget strain.  Economic reports yesterday showed U.S. jobless claims were
unchanged at 370,000 in the week ended May 12, compared with the
median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News for
a drop in claims to 365,000. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort
Index fell in the week ended May 13 to minus 43.6, a level
associated with recessions or their aftermaths, from minus 40.4
in the previous period.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1
percent today. The index dropped 1.5 percent in  New York 
yesterday, a fifth day of declines to a four-month low.  Market Correction  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  has tumbled 10 percent from
this year’s high in February, a retreat some traders call a
correction, as Greece’s failure to form a government returned
investors’ focus to Europe’s debt crisis and amid signs China’s
economic growth was slowing. That limited the advance this year
on the gauge to 1.4 percent, compared with a 3.8 percent gain by
the  S&P 500 . The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  has fallen 1.2 percent
in 2012.  Stocks in the  Asian benchmark  are valued at 11.8 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with a multiple of 12.4
for the S&P 500 and 10.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for June delivery declined 25 cents to $92.56 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Nov. 2.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. extended its record streak of
declines to an 11th day, losing 2.5 percent to 91.97.  To contact the reporter on this story:
