Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  Chairman Win
Bischoff said the prospects for the euro region are “very
concerning” after Greek politicians failed to form a
government.  “Whichever way it is going to go, clarity sooner rather
than later is always best,” Bischoff said on the sidelines of
the bank’s annual meeting in London today, referring to whether
 Greece  will exit the euro. “It is a very uncertain time and
this doesn’t help.”  Greece will hold another election next month following
failed talks on forming a government, after the May 6 vote
called into question the country’s ability to impose the
austerity measures agreed with international creditors in return
for aid. The risk of Greece leaving the euro by the end of 2013
has risen as high as 75 percent, Citigroup Inc. said May 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
