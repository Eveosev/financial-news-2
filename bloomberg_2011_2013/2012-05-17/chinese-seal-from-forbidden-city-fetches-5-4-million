An 18th-century Chinese green jade
seal associated with the Qianlong Emperor sold today at an
auction in  London  for 3.4 million pounds ($5.4 million).  Of double-gourd form carved with three dragons, the seal
had been housed in the Hall of the Three Rarities (San Xi Tang)
at the Forbidden City, Beijing, auction house Bonhams said. It
had been offered by a private European collector with an
estimate of 1 million pounds to 1.5 million pounds. The buyer,
making telephone bids, was underbid in the room by Taiwan-based
dealer Arts of Chen.  Imperial associations also boosted demand for an elaborate
18th-century cloisonne enamel-and-gilt bronze incense burner and
stand. Described as having been commissioned for use by the
Qianlong Emperor, it climbed to 780,450 pounds against an
estimate of 80,000 pounds to 120,000 pounds, the second highest
price of the sale.  Elsewhere, bidding was selective. Asian bidders have become
more discriminating at Western auctions and here 41 percent of
the 399 offered lots were rejected. The sale raised 12 million
pounds with fees, against an upper estimate of 12.7 million
pounds, based on hammer prices.  Chinese Imperial objects with European provenances have
been contested to record levels by Asian bidders in recent
years. Slow and non-payment has been an issue at some auctions.  The Toulouse auctioneer  Chassaing-Marambat  sold an 18th-
century white jade seal associated with the Qianlong Emperor for
3.8 million euros with fees on March 31. A year earlier, it had
been bid to 12.4 million euros by an unidentified Chinese client
who paid only 2.2 million euros of the auction price.  Moss Mermaid  During an afternoon auction devoted to photographs, Bonhams
achieved 5,250 pounds for an image of  Kate Moss  as a 21st-century
mermaid to benefit the U.K. children’s charity, the  NSPCC .  The Norwegian fashion photographer  Solve Sundsbo’s  later-
printed image of the British model in 2006, standing half-naked
and cross-legged in a pair of gold hipster pants, was among 11
portraits being offered to benefit the organization. From an
edition of 10, it had been valued at 3,000 pounds to 4,000
pounds.  The group also included a portrait of Florence Welch, the
lead singer of Florence + the Machine, and a portrait of  Damien Hirst  by David Bailey.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
