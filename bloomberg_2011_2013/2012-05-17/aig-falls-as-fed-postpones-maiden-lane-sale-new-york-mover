American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
posted the  biggest decline  in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Financials Index after the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
postponed the sale of assets acquired in the company’s rescue.  AIG dropped $1.29, or 4.2 percent, to $29.16 at 9:55 a.m.
in New York trading.  The Fed committed as much as $52.5 billion in 2008 to buy
mortgage-related assets that were owned or backed by  New York- 
based AIG. The insurer invested a combined $6 billion in two Fed
facilities, and is entitled to a portion of any profits after
the regulator recovers its investment  The planed transaction from the Maiden Lane III LLC
portfolio was to include $1.7 billion of debt and was scheduled
for completion today. The sale was postponed so that market
participants would have more time to weigh information about the
collateralized debt obligation, according to a person familiar
with the matter, who declined to be identified without
authorization to speak publicly. The district bank announced the
delay in a posting on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
