All good things must come to an end,
and so it is with SecondMarket Inc.’s four-year run as the
biggest private market for buyers and sellers of  Facebook Inc. (FB) 
shares.  The initial public offering  Facebook  has planned for today
forced an end to the private trading, which has driven the
company’s valuation up more than 10-fold since 2008 to exceed
$100 billion. Commissions on Facebook trading may have accounted
for almost a third of SecondMarket’s revenue last year.  The challenge to replace those sales has forced
SecondMarket Chief Executive Officer  Barry Silbert , 36, to turn
to even more exotic investment opportunities to retain his
100,000 wealthy individuals and institutions: wine, fine art,
diamonds, intellectual property and other so-called alternative
assets.  “They were probably always going to go down this route,
and now it’s just a little more a question of survival than a
question of growth,” said  Adam Sussman , partner and director of
research at Tabb Group in New York.  SecondMarket, based in New York, plans to raise money from
its clients for at least eight different investment funds, run
by outside managers, Chief Strategy Officer Jeremy Smith said.
It has already raised almost $3.5 million for a venture capital
fund that specializes in educational-technology companies. It’s
also trying to raise money for a planned $200 million fund for
investing in wine and a $500 million one for distressed
residential loans. SecondMarket’s revenue would likely come from
commissions or management fees, Smith said.  ‘Next-Generation Alternatives’  “These are next-generation alternatives,” Smith, 36, said
in an April 13 interview. “We’ve got all these people together,
and most of them came because they wanted to invest in private
companies.”  SecondMarket’s  biggest business segment now is trading
fixed income securities, ranging from bankruptcy claims to
asset-backed bonds and auction rate preferred securities, said
Bill Siegel, SecondMarket’s senior vice president of new
ventures.  SecondMarket and Facebook had an almost symbiotic
relationship. SecondMarket started in 2004, handling its first
trade in Facebook in April 2008, when the social-networking
company was worth a fraction of the $104 billion valuation that
it’s seeking in its IPO. The following year, private trades
valued it at $5.6 billion, according to New York-based research
firm PrivCo.  The offering of 421.2 million shares at $34 to $38 each,
scheduled to price today, would make Facebook more valuable than
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS)   Stock Commissions  Meanwhile, SecondMarket grew in revenue and public
recognition. Its reliance on Facebook was evident in 2011. The
value of transactions in all private shares at the firm jumped
55 percent that year to $558 million, even while some of its
most-traded stocks, such as  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , Groupon Inc. and
 Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , left for the public markets.  A SecondMarket regulatory filing in February hinted at the
effect of losing Facebook. It said commissions generated by
“one issuer” generated 31 percent of the company’s revenue
last year. Smith said only that private-company  stock trading 
has accounted for about a third of SecondMarket’s overall
revenue, and of that, Facebook during certain periods may have
accounted for more than half.  SecondMarket doesn’t disclose its commissions or management
fees it collects from clients. SecondMarket spokeswoman
Aishwarya Iyer declined to comment.  Facebook ‘Gravy Train’  After Facebook, the most-watched companies remaining on
SecondMarket’s platform include Twitter Inc., Foursquare Labs
Inc. and Dropbox Inc., according to its website. While popular,
“no other company has materialized that takes the place of
Facebook,” said PrivCo Chief Executive Officer Sam Hamadeh.
“They realize this gravy train is fading fast.”  Trading on SecondMarket and smaller rival SharesPost Inc.,
based in San Bruno,  California , is limited to so-called
accredited investors who have at least $1 million in assets
excluding their primary residence, or $200,000 in annual income,
as required by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  rules .  SecondMarket may get a boost from the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act, signed into law on April 5. The law ends
a ban on advertising private investments to non-accredited
investors, easing the way for both SecondMarket and SharesPost
to jump into that business, according to Smith and SharesPost
founder Greg Brogger.  JOBS Act  “The regulations have kept the business from being
scalable,” said Brogger. “We are looking for a variety of ways
to route investors’ capital into these companies.”  The JOBS Act may also broaden the universe of  stocks 
available for trading on these platforms. It allows companies to
amass more shareholders while staying private. Facebook was
pushed to complete its IPO this year partly because it had
surpassed 499 shareholders, requiring the company under U.S.
regulations to begin disclosing financial information as a
public company, people familiar with the matter have said.  According to Siegel, 32, SecondMarket has been “baking”
its diversification strategy for a while.  “This is an extension of the philosophy of giving our
investors access to unique alternative asset classes,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
