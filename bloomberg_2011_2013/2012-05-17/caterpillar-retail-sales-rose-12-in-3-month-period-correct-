Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the largest maker
of construction and mining equipment, said global machinery
retail sales rose 12 percent in the three months through April
compared with the same period a year earlier.  Gains around the world offset a 13 percent drop in machine
retail sales in Latin America, the Peoria, Illinois-based
company said in a securities filing today. Machine sales
increased 32 percent in  North America , 5 percent in the Asia-
Pacific region and 14 percent in Europe, Africa and the Middle
East.  “Sales volume increased in nearly all segments and in all
geographic regions except Latin America,” the company said in a
statement on April 25 when it reported first-quarter earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
