Oil may decline next week on concern
that the reversal of the Seaway Pipeline will not be enough to
alleviate a record supply glut in the central U.S., a Bloomberg
survey showed.  Nineteen of 34 analysts, or 56 percent, forecast oil will
drop through May 25. Nine respondents, or 26 percent, predicted
prices will rise and six estimated they will be little changed.
Last week, 48 percent of surveyed analysts expected a decrease.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  completed
the pipeline reversal yesterday and plan to start shipping oil
this weekend from Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for West
Texas Intermediate oil futures traded in New York, to the  Gulf
Coast . U.S.  oil inventories  rose to a 22-year high and Cushing
stockpiles peaked in the week ended May 11 as domestic output
increased, according to the Energy Department.  “The Seaway reversal has disappointed as a positive
catalyst for WTI,” said Thomas Rinaldi, a New York-based
analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC. “The production growth
has just overwhelmed the de-bottlenecking efforts.”  The 500-mile (880-kilometer), 30-inch (76-centimeter) line
is being commissioned and will initially be able to deliver
150,000 barrels per day, increasing to more than 400,000 in the
first quarter of 2013, the companies said in a statement
yesterday.  Crude stockpiles climbed  2.13 million barrels  to 381.6
million last week, the highest level since 1990. Supplies at
Cushing increased 1 million barrels to 45.1 million, the highest
level since the department began tracking inventories at the hub
in 2004.  U.S. Economy  Oil may also decline next week on signs of a slower
economic recovery in the U.S.  Consumer confidence  fell last week
to the lowest level in almost four months and more people than
forecast filed claims for  unemployment benefits .  “The general economic sentiment” is weighing on  oil
prices , said Jacob Correll, a commodity analyst at Summit Energy
Inc. in Louisville,  Kentucky .  Crude oil for June delivery dropped $4.65, or 4.8 percent,
to $91.48 a barrel this week on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since Oct. 26.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 49 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
