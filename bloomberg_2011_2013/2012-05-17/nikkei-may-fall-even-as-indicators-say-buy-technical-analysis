Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  may
deepen its slide even as a technical measure of investor
sentiment signaled a rally in shares, according to an analyst at
Mizuho Securities Co.  The 25-day Toraku index, which compares advancing and
declining shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has fallen below
70, a level some traders take to signal that shares have dropped
too far. The time may not be right for a turnaround, said Yutaka
Miura of Mizuho Securities, a unit of Japan’s second-biggest
bank by assets.  “The Nikkei may have further to fall as investors are
becoming more risk-off amid revived concern over Greece and
Europe,” Miura said. “In recent years, the Toraku buy signal
has shifted toward 60 from 70 in some cases so there could be
more room to fall.”  There have been six times since 2000 when the Nikkei 225
deepened its slide more than 5 percent even after the  Toraku
fell below 70 . Five of those instances occurred since 2006. The
Nikkei plunged 36 percent in the 16 trading days after the
Toraku threshold was breached in October 2008, as global markets
plunged following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Trading volume is key to a lasting rally, Miura said. The
Nikkei 225 advanced 5 percent in six sessions with average daily
volume of 1.2 trillion yen ($15 billion) after the Toraku
bottomed last year on Aug. 24. The market soared 61 percent in
the 12 months after the indicator fell to 68 in April 2005.
Average daily volume was 2.1 trillion yen.  The Nikkei 225 has fallen 13 percent from March 27, when
the gauge closed at its highest since September. Shares dropped
amid political turmoil in  Europe , slowing growth in  China  and a
strengthening yen.  The recent market slide sent the value of stocks on the
broader  Topix Index (TPX)  to 0.91 times book value, the lowest since
Jan. 16. A number below one means investors can buy a company
for less than the value of its net assets. The price-earnings
ratio fell to 12 times, the lowest since October 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
