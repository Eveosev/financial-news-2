Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading, refining and storage
center, fell to the lowest in four weeks, according to a unit of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen declined 1.5 million barrels, or
7.5 percent, to 18.37 million in the seven days to yesterday,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed
statement. That’s the lowest since the week to April 18.  Middle-distillate supplies including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene rose for a third week, gaining 730,000 barrels, or 7.3
percent, to 10.74 million, the ministry’s data showed.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate declined 623,000 barrels, or 6.1 percent, to 9.59
million, according to the data. That’s the lowest since the week
to Oct. 19.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
