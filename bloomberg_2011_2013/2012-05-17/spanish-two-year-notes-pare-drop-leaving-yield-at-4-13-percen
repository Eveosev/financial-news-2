Spanish two-year notes pared a
decline after the nation sold 2.5 billion euros of securities
due in 2015 and 2016.  The two-year note yield was three basis points higher at
4.13 percent as of 10:06 a.m. London time, after rising as much
as 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 4.21 percent.  Spain  sold 1 billion euros of 4 percent notes due July 2015
at an average yield of 4.88 percent, up from 4.04 percent at a
previous auction of the same securities on May 3. Investors bid
for 3 times the amount of notes allotted, compared with a so-
called bid-to-cover of 2.88 times on May 3.  The nation also sold notes maturing in January 2015 and
April 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
