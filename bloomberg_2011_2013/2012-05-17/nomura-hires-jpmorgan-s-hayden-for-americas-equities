Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s largest
brokerage, hired Tony Hayden and Jason Osier as managing
directors in the Americas equities division.  Hayden will oversee the Tokyo-based firm’s delta one
business in the region, and Osier will lead its single stock
derivatives trading team, Nomura said in a statement today.
Hayden was most recently head of delta one trading for North
America at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , and Osier was a managing
director at Plural Investments LLC, according to the statement.  They will both report to Jonathan Larkin, head of trading
for equities Americas.  Nomura has expanded from 900 U.S. employees in March 2009
to 2,350 this year. The Americas contributed 43.4 billion yen
($541 million), or 27 percent, to Nomura’s fiscal fourth-quarter
global wholesale revenue, which consists of investment banking,
fixed-income and equities trading. The quarter was the Americas
wholesale division’s strongest since Nomura began building its
U.S. operation in April 2009, the firm said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
