The Australian dollar touched a more
than five-month low, extending declines to a third-straight
week, as concern that the  European debt crisis  is spreading
curbed demand for riskier assets.  New Zealand’s dollar was set to complete the biggest weekly
loss in six months as Asian stocks extended a global slump after
Moody’s Investors Service cut the credit ratings of 16 Spanish
banks yesterday and  Greece  was downgraded by  Fitch Ratings .
Demand for the so-called Aussie and kiwi was supported as
technical indicators suggested recent declines were excessive.
Australian bond yields touched record lows.  “Growing debt and political turmoil in  Europe  is keeping
the markets risk-off,” said Kengo Suzuki, a foreign-exchange
strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of  Japan ’s
third-largest bank by market value. “Funds are escaping from
risk currencies like the Aussie and kiwi.”  Australia’s dollar tumbled as much as 0.9 percent to 97.95
U.S. cents, the weakest level since Nov. 28, before trading at
97.98 at 3:30 p.m in Sydney. The currency weakened 0.9 percent
to 77.68 yen. The  New Zealand dollar  slid 1 percent to 75.54
U.S. cents, after earlier falling to 75.48, the least since Dec.
19. It declined 1 percent to 59.90 yen.  The Aussie has dropped 2.2 percent against the greenback
this week, while the kiwi has lost 3.5 percent, the sharpest
slide since the five days ended Nov. 18.  The Australian dollar’s 14-day relative strength index
against its U.S. counterpart fell to 22, below the 30 level that
some traders see as signaling an asset may reverse declines. The
gauge for New Zealand’s currency was at 17.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks retreated 3.1
percent, while the MSCI World Index of developed-market shares
fell 1.1 percent yesterday.  Bank Downgrades  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Spain’s biggest banks, had their credit ratings cut three levels
by Moody’s, which cited a recession and mounting loan losses as
it downgraded 16 of the nation’s  lenders .  The reductions followed Moody’s May 14 downgrade of 26
Italian banks and its Feb. 13 cut of Spain’s sovereign debt.
Fitch lowered Greece’s long-term credit rating by one grade to
CCC from B- yesterday, citing heightened risk that the nation
may not be able to sustain its membership of the euro area.  The New Zealand dollar has weakened 6.1 percent in the past
three months, the worst performer among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
Australia’s currency lost 5.2 percent, the second worst.  Australia’s bonds advanced, pushing the yield on all notes
maturing in three years or longer to record lows. The 10-year
rate dropped as much 20 basis points to 3.062 percent, while the
15-year yield touched 3.391 percent and the three-year rate fell
to 2.346 percent.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, dropped to a record low of 2.37 percent.  -- Editors: Jonathan Annells, Benjamin Purvis  To contact the reporter on this story:
