Zhou Yongkang , China’s top internal
security official, said the country will “resolutely and
steadfastly” promote ethnic unity in its Xinjiang region.  Zhou made the comment while touring the region May 13 to
16, according to a program broadcast by state-run  China Central
Television  today. The Financial Times reported on May 13 that
Zhou’s power was curbed because of his alleged lobbying on
behalf of Bo Xilai. Bo was suspended from the Politburo amid
allegations his wife murdered U.K. citizen Neil Heywood in
November, in the biggest political upheaval in the country’s top
ranks in the past two decades.  Zhou’s trip was his sixth since the 17th congress of the
Communist Party of  China , CCTV said. Zhou visited an army
reserve training base, urging officers to increase emergency
readiness, and he also toured a project by Sany Heavy Industry
Co., according to the broadcast.  Zhou, 69, who heads the Communist Party’s politics and law
group, praised Bo’s policies in Chongqing at a March 8 meeting
in Beijing with Bo and the municipality’s delegation to the
National People’s Congress, China’s legislature.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
