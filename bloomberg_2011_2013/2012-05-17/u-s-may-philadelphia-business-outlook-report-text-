The following is the text of the
Philadelphia area manufacturing activity from the  Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia .  May-12  Firms responding to the May Business Outlook Survey indicated
that manufacturing growth fell back from the pace of recent
months. The survey’s broad indicators for general activity fell
into negative territory for the first time in eight months.
Indicators for new orders and employment also suggested slight
declines from April. Input price pressures were less in evidence
this month, and for the first time in nine months, more firms
reported price declines for their products than reported
increases. The survey’s indicators of future activity remained
positive but weakened considerably from April.  Indicators Suggest Slowing
The survey’s broadest measure of manufacturing conditions, the
diffusion index of current activity, fell from a reading of 8.5
in April to -5.8 in May. The index for new orders fell four
points, from 2.7 to -1.2, its first negative reading in eight
months. The shipments index edged 1 point higher and remained
just above zero.  The indexes for current unfilled orders and
delivery times both declined and registered negative readings,
suggesting lower levels of unfilled orders and faster
deliveries.  Firms’ responses suggest a slight decline in employment this
month. The current employment index, which had been positive for
eight consecutive months, decreased 19 points, to -1.3. The
percentage of firms reporting decreases in employment (16
percent) was slightly higher than the percentage reporting
increases (14 percent). Firms also reported a slight decrease in
average hours worked compared with April.  Price Pressures on the Wane
Indexes for prices paid and prices received both decreased,
suggesting that price pressures moderated this month.  Fifteen
percent of the firms reported higher prices for inputs this
month, compared with 27 percent last month.  The prices paid
index declined 18 points.  Firms also reported that prices
received for their own goods fell:  More firms reported price
decreases (12 percent) than reported increases (8 percent). The
prices received index decreased 14 points to its first negative
reading in nine months.  Firms’ Outlook Less Optimistic
The future general activity index fell notably, from a reading
of 33.8 in April to 15.0 in May. The indexes for future new
orders and shipments remained positive but fell 9 and 10 points,
respectively.  While still positive, the future employment index
showed notable deterioration this month, decreasing 17 points.  In special questions this month, firms were asked about the
factors that are influencing their production and hiring plans
(see Special Questions). While 54 percent of the firms expect to
increase production over the next six months, only 21 percent
plan to increase employment; 22 percent expect to increase work
hours without increasing staff, and 17 percent plan to increase
production by increasing the productivity of existing staff.
Firms were asked to rank the three most important factors
restraining hiring. The most frequently cited reason was the
expectation of slow sales growth. Among the top three factors
restraining hiring, the need to keep operating costs low (50
percent) ranked nearly as high as expected low sales growth (51
percent). Uncertainty about health-care costs, the inability to
find skilled workers, and uncertainty about regulations and
policies were also prominently listed.  Summary
The May Business Outlook Survey suggests that growth in the
region’s manufacturing sector fell back from last month.  Firms
reported lower levels of activity and nearly flat new orders and
employment.  Overall price pressures were reported to be on the
wane this month.  The outlook among the reporting firms was
notably less optimistic.  Special Questions (May 2012)  1. Which of the following best characterizes your short run
