Stuart Broad claimed six wickets as
 England  held West Indies to 243-9 on the opening day of the
first cricket Test at Lord’s in London.  Broad finished 6-72, with five of the wickets falling in
the day’s final 22 overs. Shivnarine Chanderpaul is 87 not out
for the visitors.  “We’re in a great position in the Test match,” Broad told
 Sky Sports . “We thought seven down at night would be pleasing,
to have nine down is great.”  England is undefeated in its last 12 Tests at Lord’s since
losing the 2005 Ashes Test at the venue.  Jonny Bairstow, the son of late England cricketer David
Bairstow, is making his Test debut as is the Windies’ Shannon
Gabriel.  West Indies hasn’t won an overseas Test in a country other
than bottom-ranked  Bangladesh  since winning in South Africa in
December 2007. The Caribbean team hasn’t won an away series
against anyone other than Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in 17 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
