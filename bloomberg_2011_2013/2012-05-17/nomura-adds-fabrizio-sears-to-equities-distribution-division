Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s largest
brokerage, hired Francis Fabrizio and Richard Sears as managing
directors in its equities-distribution unit in the Americas.  Fabrizio, who will join Nomura’s equity-research sales team
in Boston, was most recently a managing director at FBR & Co.,
the Tokyo-based firm said today in a statement. Sears, who was
most recently at  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , will help build Nomura’s
global product sales business.  Fabrizio’s hire completes Nomura’s initial buildup of its
Boston equities-sales team, according to the statement. The firm
has been hiring in the Americas, more than doubling its
headcount in the region since 2009. The Americas contributed 27
percent to Nomura’s fiscal fourth-quarter global wholesale
revenue.  Nomura also said Stephen Daly, who was previously head of
international distribution of cash equities to Europe, Middle
East and Africa clients at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , joined the firm
in February to head a U.S. equity-research distribution team. He
is based in London.  Brendan Baker, who was an equity sales trader at
Susquehanna Financial Group, joined Nomura to manage sales
trading coverage for European clients. He will be based in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
