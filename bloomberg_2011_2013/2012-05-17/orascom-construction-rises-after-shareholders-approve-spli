Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) ,
 Egypt ’s biggest publicly traded builder, gained for the first
time in four days after shareholders voted to split the company.  The  shares  of the Cairo-based company advanced 2 percent to
279.11 Egyptian pounds at 11:50 a.m. in Cairo, valuing the
company at 57.8 billion pounds ($9.6 billion). That brought the
stock’s increase this year to 39 percent. The benchmark  EGX 30
Index (EGX30)  retreated 0.5 percent today.  The shareholder approval will mean the separation of
Orascom’s construction and fertilizer businesses. Profit from
the fertilizer business surpassed that of the construction unit
in 2010 and accounted for 72 percent of 2011 profit.  As separate companies, each unit will be able to
“participate actively in consolidation opportunities in their
respective markets,” Orascom said last month. The split will
also expand their investor bases and improve liquidity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
