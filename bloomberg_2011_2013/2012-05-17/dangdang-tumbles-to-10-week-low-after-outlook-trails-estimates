E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) 
tumbled to a 10-week low in New York as the owner of China’s
biggest Internet bookseller forecast sales that fell short of
analysts’ estimates.  Shares of Beijing-based Dangdang lost 14 percent to $6.41
at 1:56 p.m. in New York. Earlier the stock touched $6.10, its
lowest lowest since March 6 on an intraday basis.  Dangdang’s second-quarter revenue will rise to 1.18 billion
yuan ($187 million), Chief Financial Officer Conor Yang said in
an investor  conference  call today. That’s less than a median
 estimate  of 1.27 billion yuan of eight analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  “Guidance was disappointing,” Adam Krejcik, an analyst at
Roth Capital in  Newport Beach , California, said in a phone
interview. “A slowdown in the year-over-year growth rate for a
company that’s burning cash and not expected to put up a
positive EPS for the foreseeable future is a big problem.”  Krejcik has a neutral rating on Dangdang.  To contact the reporter on this story:
