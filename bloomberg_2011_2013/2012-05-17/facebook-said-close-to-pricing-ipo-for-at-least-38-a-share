Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world’s most
popular social network, is close to pricing its initial public
offering for at least $38 a share, according to people familiar
with the matter.  The price may reach $39, said the people, who declined to
be identified as the process is private. Bankers and Facebook
executives were discussing the IPO price, which may still
change, one person said.  Facebook, led by Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg ,
is scheduled to price the IPO today. At $38 a share, Facebook
would be worth more than $104 billion, more valuable than
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index members such as McDonald’s Corp.,
Citigroup Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc.  Facebook had planned to offer 421.2 million shares at $34
to $38 apiece, according to regulatory filings. Jonathan Thaw, a
