Japanese  stocks  rose, with the Topix
Index snapping a six-day drop, as Japan’s economic growth beat
estimates and the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled its readiness to
provide further stimulus, boosting earnings prospects.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that gets a third of its
revenue in  North America , rose 3.3 percent. Toshiba Corp., the
maker of Regza brand televisions, rose 5.6 percent after saying
it will halt domestic production of sets.  Melco Holdings Inc. (6676) 
jumped 6.8 percent after forecasting a 22 percent rise in profit.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  added 0.9 percent to 8,876.59
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo , with trading volume 26 percent
higher than the 30-day average. The Topix gained 1.1 percent to
747.16, with 26 out of 33 industry groups advancing.  “The market is taking a breather with data out of the U.S.
and Japan after getting too much of negative news one after
another,” said Takashi Ito, a strategist equity market at
Nomura Securities Co.,  Japan ’s biggest brokerage. “The selloff
has come to a halt because we haven’t gotten new bad factors.”  The Nikkei 225 retreated 13 percent from this year’s high
on March 27 as China’s economic growth slowed and on renewed
concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis. That compares with a 6.2
percent loss in the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index and an 8.4
percent drop in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index over the same period.  The decline has brought the value of stocks on the Topix
down to 0.89 times book value, compared with 2.1 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 and 1.34 for the Stoxx Europe 600. A value
less than one means investors can buy companies for less than
the value of their assets.  Japan Growth  Shares rose after a report showed Japan’s economy grew an
annualized 4.1 percent in the first quarter, beating economists’
estimates for a 3.5 percent expansion. Reports showed U.S.
housing starts and industrial production exceeded forecasts in
April. Federal Reserve policy makers said they stand ready to
deploy more stimulus measures should the economy lose momentum,
according to minutes of their policy meeting last month.  Nissan added 3.3 percent to 777 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No.
1 exporter of consumer electronics, gained 3.9 percent to 1,161
yen.  Shares also rose as the 25-day Toraku index, which compares
the number of stocks that have advanced with the number that
have declined on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, fell to 65 yesterday.
A reading less than 70 indicates to some investors a gain is
likely.  “You don’t want to sell much more because shares have been
oversold and I think they are likely to rebound,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $70
billion. “The debt crisis will affect Japan, but its impact
will be rather small compared with the U.S. and Europe.”  Greek Gridlock  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose 0.5 percent today. The gauge
slipped 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday after the  European
Central Bank  said it will stop lending to Greek banks
temporarily as President Mario Draghi signaled it won’t bend key
principles to keep Greece in the monetary union. The political
gridlock after an inconclusive election last week reignited
fears Greece will renege on austerity pledges required for 240
billion euros ($306 billion) in aid and exit the euro.  Among other stocks that rose, Toshiba advanced 5.6 percent
to 322 yen after saying it will end making televisions in Japan
after posting a loss amid falling prices and a stronger yen.  Melco Holdings jumped 6.8 percent to 1,834 yen after saying
it expects a 22 percent rise in profit to 5.4 billion yen ($67
million) in the year ending March 31 on growing sales. The
company aims to expand in developing nations such as Brazil, it
said in a statement.  Of the 1,521 companies on the Topix that have posted
quarterly results since April 2, 287 exceeded expectations,
while 214 missed analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg News.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 7.6 percent to 22.79,
indicating traders expect a swing of 6.5 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
