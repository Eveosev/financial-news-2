The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission held at least two special meetings in the past week
to review the circumstances surrounding  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s
$2 billion loss, according to people familiar with the matter.  The SEC held a closed meeting on Saturday, May 12, and
another three days later to discuss “an examination of a
financial institution,” according to a news release e-mailed
May 15. The agency’s five commissioners held the meetings to
find out what staff knew about the losses and to discuss how the
agency should respond, said two people who declined to be
identified because the discussions weren’t public.  JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said May 10
that the bank made “egregious” mistakes and that the losses of
about $2 billion tied to synthetic credit securities were
“self-inflicted.” The announcement has spurred reviews by
several financial regulators, including the SEC, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and criminal authorities in  New York .  The losses, which could increase by $1 billion or more,
originated out of a London unit of JPMorgan’s Chief Investment
Office, which is generally responsible for managing the bank’s
interest rate, foreign currency and other economic risks.  “At times, changes in commission priorities require
alterations in the scheduling of meeting items,” the SEC said
in the release. SEC spokesman  John Nester  declined to comment
about the meetings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
