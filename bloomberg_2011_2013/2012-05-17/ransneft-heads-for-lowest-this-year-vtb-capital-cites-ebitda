OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil pipeline
operator, fell the most in seven months as VTB Capital said its
fourth-quarter earnings missed estimates after a $263 million
trading loss.  Transneft’s preferred shares tumbled 6.5 percent to 44,846
rubles at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest drop since
Oct. 4 and the lowest level since Nov. 16.  The company posted a “disappointing” $2.22 billion in
fourth-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, VTB analyst Olga Danilenko said by
phone. That missed VTB’s estimates by 7 percent because of a
$263 million trading loss, Danilenko said.  Net income in 2011 climbed to 188.1 billion rubles ($6.1
billion) from 118.6 billion rubles a year earlier under
international financial reporting standards, Transneft said
today on its website. That beat the average estimate of 186
billion rubles from 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
