India  plans to export 4 million
metric tons of wheat from government stockpiles to make room for
a record harvest, according to two government officials with
direct knowledge of the matter.  The state will also sell 14 million tons of grains for food
domestically and at below market prices, the officials said,
declining to be identified by name because the plan hasnâ€™t been
publicly announced. Food Ministry spokesman N.C. Joshi declined
to comment on the matter.  India is selling grains from stockpiles to empty warehouses
before record rice and wheat crops arrive, Food Minister K.V. Thomas said May 10. State reserves of rice and wheat jumped 20
percent to 71.12 million tons by May 1, according to the state-
run Food Corp. of India.  Wheat production will probably reach a record 90.2 million
tons in the year ending next month, the farm ministry estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
