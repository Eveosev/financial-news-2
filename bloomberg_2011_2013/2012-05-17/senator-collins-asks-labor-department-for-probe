Maine Senator  Susan Collins , the top
Republican on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
Committee, asked the Labor Department to probe what she called
unusual trading activity prior to a report on employment in
April.  “The sudden and negative movement in the currency and
futures markets suggests the possibility that some traders may
have gained unauthorized access to April’s disappointing report
prior to its official release,” Collins said in a letter to
Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis.  The Labor Department’s May 4 report showed that employers
in the U.S. added 115,000 workers to payrolls, the fewest in six
months and less than forecast by economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
