Ethanol futures rose for a third day
in  Chicago  after the government reported a second weekly
stockpile decline.  Prices jumped a day after the Energy Department said
 stockpiles  sank to 20.6 million barrels in the week ended May
11, the lowest amount since Jan. 17 and 9.3 percent below the
record of 22.7 million for the week ended March 16. Supply is up
1.1 percent from a year ago.  “For the last three or four months, everyone has been
talking about this glut,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn
Group in Chicago. “What happened to it? You’re only about a
percent off the year-ago number and almost 10 percent from the
high.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery climbed 1.1 cents, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $2.181 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest price since May 8. Ethanol has fallen 1
percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol on the West Coast added 3.5
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.325 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive increased 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.20,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago advanced 0.5 cent to $2.14 a gallon and
in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel sank 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$2.185.  To contact the reporter on this story:
