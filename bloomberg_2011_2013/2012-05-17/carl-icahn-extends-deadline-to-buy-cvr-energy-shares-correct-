(Corrects description of contingent right in fourth
paragraph of story published March 16.)  Carl Icahn  extended his $30-a-share
offer for  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  after attracting less than 1 percent
of the oil refiner’s shares.  The deadline for holders of 36 percent of stock in the
Houston-based company to tender and not withdraw their shares
will be 5 p.m. April 2, almost two weeks later than a deadline
announced March 9, Icahn said today in a statement.  About 17,387 shares had been tendered as of midnight
yesterday, according to the statement. CVR has about 86.8
million shares outstanding.  Icahn announced his intention last month to offer $30 a
share, a proposal that values the company at at least $2.6
billion, according to Bloomberg calculations. CVR holders will
have a right to an additional amount if the company is sold.
Icahn Associates Corp. owns 12.6 million shares, a 14.5 percent
stake.  Icahn today extended the “contingent value right” to
share profit he makes on any resale that’s agreed upon within 15
months from April 2. The previous window for holders to share in
his profit was nine months from March 23.  CVR rose 1 percent to $27.07 at the close in  New York . The
shares have gained 22 percent since Icahn’s stake in the company
was disclosed.  CVR’s board has twice rejected the takeover.  “His offer is simply his vehicle to put his employees and
friends on the board of CVR Energy at an inadequate price,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement March 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
