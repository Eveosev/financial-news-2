International arrivals at Greek
airports last month rose the first time this year as the peak
tourism season got under way, according to the  Association of
Greek Tourism Enterprises .  The number of people arriving from abroad advanced to
531,734 in April, from 524,842 in the same month a year ago, the
association said in a statement on its website.  In the first four months of the year international arrivals
dropped 3.7 percent to 1.09 million. Thirteen airports providing
95 percent of air arrivals from abroad were surveyed.  Athens International Airport had a 12 percent drop in the
four months through April 30, to 564,241, with the decline in
April at 7.3 percent. Traffic at Greece’s biggest airport has
slumped as the economic crisis hits travel spending and protests
dent Greece’s image abroad, the airport said in a statement last
month.  Tourism,  Greece ’s biggest industry, accounted for almost 16
percent of gross domestic product and almost one in five jobs in
2011, according to the London-based  World Travel and Tourism
Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
