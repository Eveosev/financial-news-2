OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , Russia’s biggest oil
company, asked acting Transportation Minister  Igor Levitin  to
delay until Aug. 1 a ban on use of certain rail tank cars to
transport crude, a company spokeswoman said yesterday.  OAO Lukoil (LKOH) ,  TNK-BP (TNBP)  and  OAO Bashneft (BANE)  also requested a delay
imposing the ban on the ground that it could disrupt crude
supplies to some of Russia’s largest refineries, Vedomosti
 reported , citing unidentified company officials.  On May 10, Russia’s federal transport watchdog,
Rostransnadzor, ordered the removal from railroads of more than
30 percent of rail tank cars used to move crude and oil products
after several serious accidents, the newspaper said.  The ban, which forbids use of tank cars designed for light
oil products to transport crude and heavy products, hasn’t yet
affected operations at Rosneft’s Komsomolsk refinery in the  Far
East , according to the spokeswoman, who declined to be
identified, citing company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
