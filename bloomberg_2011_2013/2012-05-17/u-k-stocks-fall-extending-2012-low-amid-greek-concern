  U.K. stocks  declined for a fourth
day, extending the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) ’s lowest level this year, amid
continued uncertainty about Greece’s future in the euro area and
the strength of Spain’s banks.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and Barclays Plc lost more
than 3 percent in London as Spain’s Bankia SA plunged as much as
29 percent in Madrid.  Vedanta Resources (VED)  Plc paced a selloff in
mining companies. Retailers  Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA)  and  French
Connection Group Plc (FCCN)  tumbled after reporting falling sales.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index slid 1.2 percent to 5,338.38
at the close in London, completing its longest stretch of losses
since November. The gauge has  declined 11 percent from its 2012
high  on March 16, entering a so-called technical correction. The
FTSE All-Share Index also retreated 1.2 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 1.9 percent.  “While the situation in  Greece  represents a greater short-
term risk for investors, the banking and economic crisis in
Spain is just as significant,” said Ted Scott, a portfolio
manager at F&C Asset Management Plc in London. “The Spanish
government will probably be forced to pour more money into the
banks.”  The FTSE 100 has tumbled 7 percent this month, helping to
wipe more than $3 trillion from the value of  global stock
markets , amid mounting concern Greece will exit the euro. The
country this week failed to form a new government at the May 6
elections, forcing policy makers to call another vote.  Bank Shares Slip  Lenders dropped in Europe today as the  European Central
Bank  said it will temporarily stop lending to some Greek banks
to limit its risk. The central bank said yesterday it will push
the responsibility for lending to some Greek financial
institutions onto the country’s central bank until they have
sufficiently boosted their capital.  In Spain, Bankia slumped as much as 29 percent after El
Mundo reported that the lender’s depositors had withdrawn about
1 billion euros ($1.27 billion) since May 9, the day the
government said it was taking over the lender.  Banks extended their selloff across Europe after Expansion,
another Spanish newspaper, reported that Moody’s Investors
Service would probably downgrade Spain’s banks today, citing
people familiar with the situation.  RBS led U.K. banks lower, falling 3.7 percent to 21.06
pence.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  slid 3.8 percent to 181.9 pence and  LLoyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  retreated 3.6 percent to 27.65 pence.  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) , which today doubled its target for generating
extra revenue from greater cooperation between its four
businesses to $2 billion, lost 2.5 percent to 520.9 pence.  Vedanta, Xstrata, Kazakhmys  Vedanta Resources declined 4 percent to 985 pence as the
copper producer reported a 92 percent drop in full-year profit
to $59.8 million on higher financing costs, largely because of
the loan it arranged to acquire oil producer Cairn India Ltd.  Xstrata Plc slid 3 percent to 956.2 pence,  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) 
fell 3 percent to 690.5 pence and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  retreated
2.1 percent to 2,046 pence.  Kesa Electricals tumbled 14 percent to 46.76 pence after
revenue at stores open at least a year fell 5.9 percent in the
period from Jan. 9 to April 30. The  average estimate  of five
analysts had called for a 5.3 percent decline.  The owner of the Darty electronics retailer  predicted
annual profit  at the “mid-point” of investor expectations
after sales worsened as it sold fewer televisions.  Rival  Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS)  lost 4.9 percent to 14.36 pence.  French Connection Tumbles  French Connection sank 24 percent to 30 pence after the
clothing retailer said  sales  in the first three months of its
financial year declined 9.5 percent and it was unlikely that
full-year profit will meet market expectations.  Elsewhere,  Aviva Plc (AV/)  slid 4.7 percent to 267.7 pence after
the  U.K.’s second-biggest insurer by market value  reported a 7
percent decline in first-quarter sales of life insurance and
pensions to 6.52 billion pounds ($10.3 billion). That missed
some analysts’ estimates.  Investec Plc (INVP)  lost 3.4 percent to 317.5 pence after the
owner of a bank and money manager in South Africa and the U.K.
reported a 26 percent drop in earnings excluding one-off items
to 31.8 pence apiece. That missed the 33 pence  median estimate 
of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company cited rising
costs and a slump in trading income amid Europe’s debt crisis.  ICAP Plc (IAP)  paced advancing shares, climbing 1.6 percent to
342 pence after Numis Securities raised its recommendation for
the world’s largest broker of transactions between banks to buy
from hold. UBS AG also upgraded the shares to neutral.  TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc (TALK)  surged 20 percent to 159 pence
as the company raised its margin forecast after it transferred
customers to its own network faster than it predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
