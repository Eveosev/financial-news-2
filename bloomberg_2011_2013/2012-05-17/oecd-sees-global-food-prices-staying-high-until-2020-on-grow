Global food prices are likely to stay
high until 2020 as the population increases and emerging market
economies grow, said Jesus Anton, a senior agricultural policy
analyst at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.  Food prices may stabilize at high levels and keep
government import bills near a record, increasing the risk of
social unrest in the world’s least developed countries, the
 United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said earlier
this month. Global food costs are about 40 percent above the
average in the past 10 years, according to a UN gauge, which
tracks 55 commodities.  Prices will stay high as demand from  emerging markets  grows
and as consumers there eat more meat, Anton said in an interview
at a Euromoney conference in  London  today. The increasing use of
scarce resources needed for  food production , such as land and
water, for non-food purposes will also keep prices elevated, he
said.  Global food output must rise 70 percent by 2050 to feed a
world population expected to grow to 9 billion from 7 billion,
according to the FAO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
