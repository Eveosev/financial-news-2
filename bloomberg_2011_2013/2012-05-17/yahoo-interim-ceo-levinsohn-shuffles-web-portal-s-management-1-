Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  interim Chief Executive
Officer Ross Levinsohn reorganized the management team of the
struggling Web portal after taking the helm earlier this week.  Mickie Rosen was named head of global media and commerce,
according to a company memo from Levinsohn obtained by Bloomberg
News. Mollie Spilman was named chief marketing officer, while
Sam Shrauger, a former executive at  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal unit
hired last month to run a commerce unit, will leave the company,
the memo said.  Levinsohn stepped into the CEO role after Scott Thompson
resigned following an inquiry into errors in his academic
record. Thompson, whose exit also was part of a board
restructuring, had joined the company in January after previous
Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz was fired in September. Thompson was
formerly president of PayPal.  “I’m fired up and I hope you are too,” Levinsohn said in
the memo to employees. “I believe in the power of what we’re
doing.”  Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, fell 2.7 percent to
$14.87 at the close in  New York . The shares have fallen 7.8
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
