Frank-Walter Steinmeier,  Germany ’s
former foreign minister and leader of the Social Democratic
opposition, warned against speculating about Greece leaving the
euro as he called Greek political developments “alarming.”  “Those who lapse into populism and speculate frivolously
about a Greek exit from the euro are playing a dangerous game,”
Steinmeier said in an e-mailed statement today. “If Greece
leaves the euro, there will be consequences for the entire  euro
zone . The present market turbulence is giving us an initial
taste of that.”  He also said any future Greek government must stick to its
commitments in exchange for the promised aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
