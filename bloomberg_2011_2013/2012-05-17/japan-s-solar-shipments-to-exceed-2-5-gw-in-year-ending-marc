Japan’s domestic shipments of 
solar-power devices will exceed 2.5 gigawatts in the year ending
March 2013, said  Mikio Katayama , chairman of the  Japan 
Photovoltaic Energy Association , at a press conference.  The increase in cells and modules follows a decision by
Japan to start preferential rate payments for electricity
generated from renewable sources in July to encourage investment
in clean energy.  The start of the so-called feed-in tariff program is “the
first step in the era of solar-power generation,” said
Katayama, who is also the chairman of Sharp Corp. “The public
and private sectors need to work together to increase solar
power further.”  Producers of solar power will receive 42 yen (52 U.S.
cents) a kilowatt-hour for 20 years, or three times the 13.65
yen charged to industrial and commercial users, according to the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.  The government projects total capacity of solar power will
increase 42 percent to about 6.8 gigawatts for the year ending
March 31, 2013, which is enough to power about 1.65 million
Japanese homes.  Katayama also said more than one million homes in  Japan 
have installed solar panels on their roofs by April since 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
