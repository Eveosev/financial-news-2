China , the world’s biggest supplier
of rare earths, issued additional export quotas to companies
that passed the government environment assessment, leaving out a
unit of the nation’s top producer of the metallic elements.  While some units of Baotou Iron & Steel Group,  Aluminum
Corp. (2600)  of China and other companies received quotas,  Inner
Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111) , one of the units
of Baotou Steel, remained excluded, according to a statement on
the trade ministry’s  website . Companies that fail to meet
environment-protection standards by July 31 will not be allowed
to export this year, the ministry said.  “It’s a surprise that Inner Mongolia Baotou still can’t
get an export permit,” Wei Chishan, a Shanghai-based analyst at
SMM Information & Technology Co., a data provider. “The
government is very serious about the environment issue as
everyone is looking at the company. So far we haven’t seen a
significant recovery in demand for rare earths.”  Rare earths are 17 chemically similar elements used in
products including  Boeing Co (BA) ’s helicopter blades and  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) ’s hybrid cars. China, which has more than 90 percent
of the global rare-earth market, will keep quotas little changed
this year, the ministry said Dec. 27, after exporters used only
half the quantity permitted for last year because of weakening
demand.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth added 0.8 percent to
close at 44.11  yuan  today in Shanghai, trailing a 1.4 percent
gain in the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. Three calls by
Bloomberg News to the company’s board secretary office seeking
comment went unanswered.  First Round  China allocated 10,546 tons of first-round export quotas to
nine companies, including China Minmetals Corp. and Sinosteel
Corp., on Dec. 27, saying another 14,358 tons would be issued to
complete the first-round quotas pending environmental approval
and the total would account for about 80 percent of the volume
for 2012. Today, it issued an additional 10,680 tons as part of
the first-round quota.  Guangdong Zhujiang Rare Earths Co. and Huhhot Rongxin New
Metal Smelting Co. are among those awaiting environmental
approval, according to the ministry. China’s export quota this
year may be about 31,130 metric tons, according to Bloomberg
News calculations based on first-round figures given Dec. 27.
The quota was 30,184 tons in 2011 and 30,258 tons in 2010.  The export prices from China for eight rare earths found at
the Mount Weld project in Western  Australia  fell to $92.2 a
kilogram on average in the first quarter, compared with $147.96
in 2011, according to figures on  Lynas Corp. (LYC) ’s website. The
price fell to $63.06 on May 14, the company said.  China has curbed output and exports since 2009, when quotas
were set at 50,145 tons, to conserve resources and protect the
environment.  Japan , the world’s biggest importer of rare earths,
the U.S. and European Union filed a complaint to the  World Trade
Organization  against China’s limits on the exports.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
