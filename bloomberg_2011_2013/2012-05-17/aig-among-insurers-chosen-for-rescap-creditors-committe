American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out insurer,  Allstate Corp. (ALL)  and FGIC Corp. were named
members of the unsecured-creditors committee for Residential
Capital’s bankruptcy.  Insurers and trustees for residential mortgage-backed
securities are among the committee’s nine members, according to
a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  Bond insurer  MBIA Inc. (MBI) , Wilmington Trust,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,
 Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  and U.S. Bancorp are also members,
according to the filing by the U.S. Trustee. The ninth member is
a representative of plaintiffs in a mortgage-lending lawsuit.  ResCap, the mortgage unit of taxpayer-owned  Ally Financial
Inc. (ALLY) , sought court protection May 14 after losses piled up on
subprime and Alt-A mortgages that were bundled into bonds during
the credit crisis. The committee will negotiate on behalf of
unsecured creditors seeking payment from ResCap.  The U.S. Trustee, part of the Justice Department, monitors
bankruptcy proceedings and selects members of the committee to
represent unsecured creditors.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
