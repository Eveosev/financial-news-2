Kevin Durant  scored the go-ahead
basket with 18 seconds left and the Oklahoma City Thunder scored
the gameâ€™s last nine points in a 77-75 defeat of the Los Angeles
Lakers in the National Basketball Association playoffs.  The Thunder have a two-games-to-none lead in the best-of-
seven Western Conference semifinal series.  Also last night, Kevin Garnett had 27 points and 13
rebounds to lead the  Boston Celtics  to a 107-91 win against the
Philadelphia 76ers. The Celtics hold a two-games-to-one
advantage in their Eastern Conference playoff series.  At Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, Durant hit a
seven-foot running shot along the baseline to give his team a
76-75 lead. Durant, who had 22 points, added a foul shot in the
final second.  Russell Westbrook  had 15 points for the Thunder.  Andrew Bynum and Kobe Bryant each scored 20 points for the
Lakers, who host Game 3 tomorrow.  At Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, the Celtics took the
lead for good early in the second quarter. Paul Pierce had 24
points and 12 rebounds, and Rajon Rondo added 23 points and 14
assists for the Celtics.  Thaddeus Young came off the bench to score 22 points and
Jrue Holiday contributed 15 for the 76ers, who host Game 4
tomorrow.  The winner of the second-round series will play the  Miami
Heat  or the Indiana Pacers for a place in the NBA Finals. That
series resumes tonight in Indianapolis with the teams tied at
one game apiece.  Also tonight, the  San Antonio Spurs  will seek to open a 2-0
lead against the Los Angeles Clippers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
