Fewer American teenagers and young
adults are lighting up as cigarette taxes that have broken the
$3-a-pack threshold in some states make  smoking  too costly,
according to the latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health.  Daily smoking , the leading cause of preventable illness and
death in the U.S., fell to 15.8 percent in 2010 among young
adults age 18 to 25, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration said in a report today. That share is
down from 20.4 percent in 2004. Everyday smoking among people
age 12 to 17 dropped to about 2 percent from 3.3 percent.  Increased education and enforcement efforts targeting
 younger smokers , combined with “substantial increases in
cigarette taxes,” contributed to the decline, the  agency  said.
The mean state excise tax on cigarettes reached $1.46 a pack
last year, up from $1.34 in 2009, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.  New York , among five states
charging $3 or more, had the highest levy at $4.35.  “Although some progress has been made in curbing youth
smoking, the fact remains that one in 12 adolescents currently
smoke and one in three young adults smoke, which means that far
too many young people are still endangering their lives,”
Pamela Hyde, the agency’s administrator, said in a statement.  Young adults who reported cigarette use in the past month,
either daily or more casually, declined to 34.2 percent in 2010,
from 39.5 percent in 2004, according to the agency. Rates among
adolescents fell to 8.3 percent in 2010, from 11.9 percent.  Health education programs at schools, antismoking campaigns
that educate young people, increased enforcement of laws
prohibiting the sale of tobacco to people younger than 18 and
higher taxes are helping, the mental health agency said.  New York Taxes  Young adults who smoked 26 or more cigarettes a day fell to
3.4 percent in 2010, from 6 percent in 2004, the survey showed.
Those who smoked five or fewer a day increased to 28.6 percent
in 2010, from 24.4 percent. A pack typically contains 20
cigarettes.  A 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes can reduce
consumption almost 4 percent among adults and have greater
effect on youths, according to the  CDC .  In addition to  state taxes , the federal government tacks on
$1.01 and local municipalities can levy their own charges.  New
York City  adds $1.50 on top of the state and federal tax, while
Cook County,  Illinois , adds $2.68 a pack, according to the CDC.
Missouri had the lowest cigarette tax last year at 17 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
