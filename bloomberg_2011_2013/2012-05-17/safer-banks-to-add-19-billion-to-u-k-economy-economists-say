A banking system strengthened by
tougher capital rules will benefit the U.K. economy by 11.9
billion pounds ($18.9 billion) a year, according to a paper
published by the U.K.  Financial Services Authority .  Regulators could raise minimum  capital requirements  for the
biggest banks by “an additional 22 percentage points” and
“still produce overall positive net benefits in the long run,”
five academics said in their report to the financial regulator
published today.  “The benefits arise from the reduction in the probability
that a systemic crisis, one which permanently reduces the level
of U.K. GDP, occurs,” according to the academics, including FSA
economist Zanna Iscenko. “Clearly the benefits are not
observable as they represent outcomes that are not expected to
occur as a result of the policy implementation.”  Global regulators’ tougher capital requirements, known as
Basel III, could see the world’s biggest banks raise about $566
billion of common equity to meet rules by 2019, analysts at
 Fitch Ratings  said today. The Basel group agreed in 2010 to more
than triple the core capital that lenders must hold, as well to
make them hold minimum stocks of easy-to-sell assets.  Banks can change their business models to avoid an
additional capital surcharge for the biggest lenders, “possibly
altering the structure of the U.K. banking system,” according
to the report.  Core tier 1 capital is a measure of high-quality, loss-
absorbing, reserves that banks have to hold against risky
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
