The Czech Republicâ€™s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose 1 percent to 882.3 at the end of trading in Prague, its
third day of gains.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of Austria jumped 1.8 percent
to 372.6 koruna, also advancing for a third day. Lenders were
among the biggest stock gainers in  Europe  on speculation that
the euro area and China will step up economic stimulus.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, climbed 1.5 percent to 105 koruna. The stock slid
13 percent in the previous seven sessions to the weakest since
July 2009, lowering its 14-day relative strength index to 25
yesterday. Readings below 30 suggest in technical analysis that
an asset may rise. The RSI increased to 28 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
