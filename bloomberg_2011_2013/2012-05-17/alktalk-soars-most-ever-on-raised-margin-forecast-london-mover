TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc (TALK)  advanced
the most ever in London trading after raising its margin
forecast on transferring customers to its own network faster
than it predicted.  TalkTalk, the British broadband provider split off from
 Carphone Warehouse Group Plc (CPW) , soared as much as 19 percent, the
steepest gain since the shares started trading in March 2010.
The stock was up 14 percent at 151.5 pence as of 10:21 a.m.  The company has reached its 20 percent margin target for
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization,
set out 18 months ago, and raised its forecast to 25 percent for
the mid-term, London-based TalkTalk said today.  “We’ve made more progress on unbundling our customers than
we expected,” Chief Executive Officer Dido Harding said in an
interview, referring to the transfer of customers from the
network of  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  to that of TalkTalk. “But we won’t be
as quick” on the new target.  The company is nearing completion of the transfer of
clients from BT’s network and has cut one-third of its headcount
within a year as customer broadband additions fall. TalkTalk is
also preparing to unveil the repeatedly delayed YouView Internet
TV joint venture to boost demand for its offers.  “I’m not that fussed about the date of the launch,” said
Harding, a former  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  executive. TalkTalk will start
its TV campaign in September after the  Olympic Games , she said.  “Is it working perfectly yet? No, it’s not,” Harding said
of the proposed catch-up service. The programming design and
layout may resemble the BBC’s iPlayer service, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
