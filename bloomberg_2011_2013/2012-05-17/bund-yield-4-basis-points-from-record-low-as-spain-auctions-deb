German  bonds  rose, pushing two-,
five- and 10-year yields to record lows, as  Spain ’s borrowing
costs jumped at a debt sale a day after Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said the nation risked losing access to market funding.  Dutch 10-year yields slid to an all-time low, while Spanish
and Italian two-year rates climbed. Irish two-year securities
slipped for a 10th day after the  European Central Bank  said it
will temporarily stop lending to some Greek banks, stoking
concern the region’s financial crisis may deepen. European
stocks declined, led by Spanish lender Bankia SA.  “People are still worried about what’s happening in
peripheral  Europe ,” said Mohit Kumar, head of European
interest-rate strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in  London . The market
is “very much focused on  Greece ,” he said. “Core rates will
remain supported.”  German 10-year yields declined four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.43 percent at 4:18 p.m. London time,
after falling to 1.42 percent. The 1.75 percent security due
July 2022 advanced 0.365, or 3.65 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,271)
face amount, to 102.98.  The  two-year  note yield slipped two basis points to 0.05
percent after reaching 0.046 percent. The  five-year  rate dropped
to as low as 0.475 percent.  Ten-year bund futures climbed to an all-time high. The
contract expiring in June rose as much as 0.3 percent to 143.79.  The Dutch 10-year yield fell as much as five basis points
to 1.925 percent, the least since Bloomberg began compiling the
data in 1990.  Spanish Yields  Spain auctioned 2.49 billion euros of debt, including July
2015 notes at a yield of 4.876 percent. That compares with 4.037
percent when they were sold two weeks ago. The nation also sold
January 2015 debt and April 2016 notes.  Today’s auction “fits the recent pattern that the Spanish
Treasury is able to get its supply away, but at an ever-
increasing cost,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income
strategist at Rabobank International in London. “We’re running
out of road of debt sustainability for Spain. Some form of
outside intervention will be necessary.”  The extra yield that investors get for holding Spain’s 10-
year bonds instead of benchmark German bunds increased for the
fourth time in five days, rising to 489 basis points, after
surging yesterday to a euro-era record of 507 basis points.  ‘Serious Risk’  Rajoy said yesterday that the nation faces the “serious
risk” of losing access to debt markets. Budget cuts “are what
decide whether we can finance ourselves or not,” Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro said yesterday.  Spanish 10-year yields rose three basis points to 6.32
percent, after surging to more than 6.50 percent yesterday for
the first time since November.  The yield on Spain’s two-year notes climbed 10 basis points
to 4.20 percent, after increasing by as much as 21 basis points
to 4.31 percent. It reached 4.33 percent yesterday, the highest
since Dec. 13.  Yields on Italian notes due April 2014 jumped for a fifth
day, rising 15 basis points to 3.70 percent, after touching 3.88
percent, the most since Jan. 23.  European stocks declined for a fourth day, with the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index declining 1 percent.  Bankia (BKIA)  shares fell 13
percent after a report that depositors withdrew 1 billion euros
in the past week.  Volatility on Italian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets followed by Belgium and Ireland, according to measures
of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-
default swaps.  The yield on Ireland’s two-year notes climbed 13 basis
points to 6.82 percent. Irish debt securities have also declined
amid speculation voters will reject a referendum this month that
would enshrine planned European fiscal rules in national law.  German debt has returned 2.6 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds have lost 3.6
percent, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
