Bank of England  markets director  Paul
Fisher  said he’d consider voting to revive so-called
quantitative easing were the U.K. to slide into a deep
recession, Dow Jones Newswires reported him as saying.  “We’ve had a couple of quarters of negative growth, but we
haven’t really had a fall back into a deep recession,” Fisher
said in an interview published today. “If I saw that risk re-
emerging, then personally I would want to think again about
restarting.”  “For me, the key reason for restarting QE last October was
the possibility that the U.K. could topple over into a deep
recession again,” he said. “We seem to have hopefully headed
that risk off at the pass. If there is not that serious
possibility of deflation down the road, then I think there is
less impetus behind doing more asset purchases.”  Were inflation to continue to “stick, year after year,
above the target, then we will lose credibility,” Fisher said.
“We are mindful of that and we don’t want to take risks with
credibility.”  Officilas would also be “uncomfortable” were the pound to
continue to appreciate,’’ he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
