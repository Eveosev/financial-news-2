Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard , asked about JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $2
billion trading loss, said large banks should be broken up into
smaller businesses that can be more easily managed.  “I would back my colleague  Richard Fisher  in that we
should split up these larger banks,” Bullard said today in
Louisville, Kentucky, citing comments by the Dallas Fed
president. “It would be simpler to say we want smaller
institutions so they can safely fail” if they fail, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
