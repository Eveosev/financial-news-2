Purchases of Turkish land and homes
by foreigners will probably rise by $20 billion over the next
four years after the government eased restrictions, according to
the country’s second-biggest real estate investment trust.  The increase will mainly come from  Persian Gulf  and Central
Asian countries,  Torunlar Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (TRGYO) , said
today in a statement. The company hired  Sotheby’s (BID)  International
Realty Inc. to sell properties in its Mall of Istanbul
development, it said.  The government last week abolished a rule that barred
Turkish property purchases by citizens of countries where Turks
aren’t allowed to buy real estate. Foreigners bought as much as
$2.5 billion worth of property annually in Turkey before the law
was changed, Torunlar Chairman Aziz Torun said in the statement.  Torun singled out Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Qatar and
Saudi Arabia as countries that will drive the rising demand.  The Mall of Istanbul complex, which includes 32,000 square
meters (344,000 square feet) of  office space , 1,114 homes, a
300-room hotel and a shopping mall will be completed in November
2013, the company said in the statement. The project was built
with an investment of $370 million.  Torunlar fell 0.7 percent to 5.4 liras in Istanbul trading
as of 3:57 pm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
