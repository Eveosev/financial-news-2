Rodrigo Rato , the former
International Monetary Fund managing director who resigned as
executive chairman of  Bankia SA (BKIA)  last week, said  Europe  is not
prepared to stem the consequences of Greece exiting the single
currency.  “If right now you open the door to the idea that the euro
is not a one-way bet, that countries can get out for different
reasons, I don’t think we’re prepared for the consequences,”
Rato said in a panel discussion in Frankfurt late last night.
“I think the consequences could really be unmanageable.”  The failure of Greek lawmakers to form a government after
inconclusive elections this month has fueled speculation about
the country abandoning the euro. A Greek exit could be
“technically” managed, European Central Bank Governing Council
member Patrick Honohan said on May 12.  “It would be a huge European mistake and it would be a
pity to start the century with a huge European mistake,” Rato
said.  Rato also said that it’s impossible to shield Spanish banks
from the impact of economic recession.  “The problem with the Spanish banking system is that with
a country in a five-year recession that nobody expected, balance
sheets are deteriorating much more than anybody expected,” Rato
said. “You can’t insulate bank balance sheets from the business
cycle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
