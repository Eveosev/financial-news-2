The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell
as east European shares retreated on concern that Europe’s debt
crisis will reduce exports and strain the region’s financial
system.  The MSCI gauge declined 0.2 percent to 922.71 at 12:40 p.m.
in London, after earlier gaining 1 percent. More than 360 stocks
in the index rose, while 267 fell, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
