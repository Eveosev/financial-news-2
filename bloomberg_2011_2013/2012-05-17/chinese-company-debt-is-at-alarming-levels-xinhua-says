Chinese companies have accumulated
“alarming levels” of debt and will have difficulty with
payments in an economic downturn, Xinhua News Agency said,
citing  Li Yang , vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.  The debt-to-asset ratio of Chinese companies is about 105.4
percent, the highest among 20 countries examined in yearlong
study by Li’s team of borrowing by China’s government,
corporations and individuals, Xinhua reported.  Chinese companies tend to borrow from banks instead of
raising funds in  capital markets , Li said, as cited by Xinhua.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
