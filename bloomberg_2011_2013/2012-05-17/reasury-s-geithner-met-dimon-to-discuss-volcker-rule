Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  met with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon in March to discuss the Volcker Rule, according to
records of meetings released by the Treasury Department.  In the March 6 meeting, the two also discussed derivatives
trading, and capital and liquidity requirements, the records
showed. The Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank Act overhauling
financial regulation, restricts proprietary trading by banks
with federally insured deposits.  Dimon on May 10 disclosed what he called an “egregious”
trading loss of $2 billion in the New York-based company’s chief
investment office. Regulators, including the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, are examining the loss.  Bryan Hubbard , an OCC spokesman, said this week that it was
“premature to conclude” whether the trades would have been
either permitted or banned under the Volcker Rule, which hasn’t
yet taken effect.  A spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve, Barbara Hagenbaugh,
said the central bank, which supervises JPMorgan’s holding
company, is studying organizational issues around the trading
loss to ensure they aren’t repeated in other areas of the bank.  Geithner in March also met with bankers including Bryan Jordan, CEO of Memphis-based First Horizon National Corp.; Beth Mooney, CEO of Cleveland-based  KeyCorp (KEY) ; and Jim Rohr, CEO of
Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc., the Treasury
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
