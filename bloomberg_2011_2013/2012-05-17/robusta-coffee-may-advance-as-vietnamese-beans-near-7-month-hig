Robusta coffee may climb for an ninth
day in  London , the longest winning streak since February, after
prices for the beans in top grower  Vietnam  approached the
highest level in almost seven months. Sugar climbed.  Vietnamese coffee rose to 41,800 dong ($2.01) a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) yesterday, the highest since Oct. 25, according to
 data  on Bloomberg. Supplies from Brazil and  Indonesia , the
second and third-biggest robusta producers, are selling at a
premium to NYSE Liffe, reducing the incentive for exporters to
deliver beans to the exchange, data from Volcafe, the coffee
unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. and broker Flavour Coffee show.  “There has been such a strong move up in recent weeks that
it would be logical that there will be some sort of retracement
in the coming days, though it would take an element of bravery
to stand in robusta’s way,” London-based broker Sucden
Financial Ltd. said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Robusta coffee for July delivery was unchanged at $2,189 a
metric ton by 10:24 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. The price
touched $2,220 a ton, the highest since Sept. 8. Arabica coffee
for July delivery slid 0.2 percent to $1.776 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York .  “There has also been an increase of the July open interest
showing fresh positions being added, seeming to have bolstered
to the push in this rally,” Sucden Financial said in the
report.  Robusta coffee for July delivery is $23 a ton more
expensive than the September futures, reversing a discount last
week, data on Bloomberg show. That market structure is known as
backwardation and may signal limited supplies.  Price Climb  Robusta coffee has risen on speculation demand will keep
growing. Global coffee demand will rise by about 2 percent in
2011-12, according to London-based broker Marex Spectron Group.
All of the growth will come from robusta beans as consumption
expands in  emerging markets , notably in  Asia  and  South America ,
the broker said. Prices may reach $2,236 a ton by the end of
May, a Bloomberg survey published on March 26 showed.  White, or refined, sugar for August delivery was up 0.3
percent to $578.20 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for July
delivery advanced 0.3 percent to 20.79 cents on ICE.  Cocoa for July delivery fell 0.1 percent to 1,539 pounds
($2,447) a ton in London. Cocoa for July delivery was down 0.4
percent to $2,283 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
