The cost of insuring against default
on European debt fell, according to BNP Paribas SA.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 11.5 basis
points to 730.5 at 10 a.m. in London. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings dropped five basis points to 174.5.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell 6.5 basis points to 286.5 and the
subordinated index declined five to 476.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
