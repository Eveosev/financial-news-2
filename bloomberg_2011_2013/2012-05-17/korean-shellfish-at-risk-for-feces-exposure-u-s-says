The U.S. is curbing shellfish imports
from  South Korea  after food safety regulators determined that
inadequate sanitation may have exposed oysters, mussels, clams
and scallops to human fecal waste.  The  Food and Drug Administration  removed Korean shippers
from its certified shellfish list on May 1, Curtis Allen, an
agency spokesman, said in an e-mail today. The FDA cited risks
from water and land-based pollution, and said any imports from
the nation prior to this month shouldn’t be sold or consumed.  The contamination may lead the shellfish to carry the
norovirus, which isn’t typically life-threatening and can cause
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramping. No illnesses
from the consumption of Korean shellfish have been reported this
year, Allen said. Korean shellfish represents a small amount of
the shellfish sold in the U.S., he said.  “Korean molluscan shellfish that entered the U.S. prior to
May 1 and any product made with Korean molluscan shellfish are
considered adulterated,” Allen said. Removal of Korean shippers
from the certified list “is intended to stop the import of
molluscan shellfish harvested from polluted waters.”  The FDA is working to determine where the product has been
distributed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
