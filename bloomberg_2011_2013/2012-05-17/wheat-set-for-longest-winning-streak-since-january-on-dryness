Wheat gained for a fourth day, the
longest winning streak since January, on speculation dry weather
in the U.S.,  Australia  and  Russia  will curb yields in the
world’s three biggest shippers this year.  The July-delivery contract gained as much as 1.4 percent to
$6.4775 a bushel, extending yesterday’s 5 percent jump, the
biggest advance for the most-active contract since March 30. It
was up 0.4 percent at $6.41 by 11:24 a.m. in  London .  Parts of central and southern plains in the U.S. were
mainly dry, with temperatures in north-central and central
Kansas rising to 79 to 92 degrees Fahrenheit while warm
temperatures were also felt across east areas of North
Caucasus Russia, the lower Volga valley and eastern Ukraine,
Telvent DTN Inc. said in a report yesterday. In Australia’s
eastern grain belt, large areas had dryness, slowing planting
progress, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said.  “Obviously, when there are concerns about supplies, that
tends to be positive for prices,”  Michael Creed , an
agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank Ltd., said by
phone from  Melbourne  today.  Rainfall in Kansas, the largest U.S. grower of winter-
wheat, was scarce in the week ended May 13, according to a
government weekly bulletin.  Milling wheat futures jumped 0.9 percent to 205 euros
($206.31) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  Corn Prices  Corn for July delivery fell 0.2 percent to $6.19 a
bushel, after jumping 3.8 percent yesterday. Futures advanced
after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said that China bought
900,000 metric tons of the grain from U.S. exporters, including
660,000 tons previously reported as sold to unknown destination.  “China is becoming an increasingly important buyer of
corn, mirroring the role that it plays in soybeans,” NAB’s
Creed said. “Any news on what  China ’s import program is like
certainly does have a price impact.”  Production of soybeans in China, the world’s largest buyer
of the oilseed, may fall 7.1 percent to 13 million tons in 2012
from a year earlier, according to the China National Grain and
Oils Information Center.  Soybeans for July delivery gained for a third day, rising
 0.5 percent to $14.29 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
