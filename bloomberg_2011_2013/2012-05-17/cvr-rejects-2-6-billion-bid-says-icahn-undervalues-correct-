(Corrects description of contingent right in last
paragraph of story published March 1.)  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  rejected an
unsolicited offer from billionaire investor Carl Icahn, saying
it “substantially undervalues the company.”  The bid by CVR’s largest shareholder “contains an
extraordinarily long list of conditions that provide Mr. Icahn
with maximum flexibility to avoid closing the offer,” the  Sugar
Land , Texas-based refining company said in a statement today.  Icahn on Feb. 16 announced his intention to offer $30 a
share plus give CVR holders a right for an additional payment if
the company is sold, an amount he estimated at $7 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
