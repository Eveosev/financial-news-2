The number of condominiums offered
for sale in  Tokyo  and surrounding areas in April had the biggest
gain in 18 years as  Japan ’s property industry recovered from a
record earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.  The number of new condominiums put on the market last month
surged 82 percent from a year earlier,  the Real Estate Economic
Research Institute  said in a report released in Tokyo today.
Japanese developers introduced 4,211 apartments into the market
last month, compared with 2,336 a year earlier. The last time
the monthly data had a bigger gain was October 1994, when it
rose 86 percent.  An improvement in Tokyo’s housing market has helped
developers post higher earnings. Mitsui Fudosan Co., Japan’s
biggest developer, last week said it expects full-year profit to
rise 9.7 percent in the current business year, while Sumitomo
Realty & Development Co. said on May 14 full-year net income
rose 4.6 percent, helped by a recovery in its housing business.  The Topix Real Estate Index, a measure of 46 property-
related stocks, had the biggest gain in one month and closed 2
percent higher, bringing its year-to-date advance to 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
