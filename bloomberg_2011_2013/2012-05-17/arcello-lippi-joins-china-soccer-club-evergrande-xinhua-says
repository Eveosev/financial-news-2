Marcello Lippi, who led Italy’s
national soccer team to  World Cup  victory in 2006, was hired as
coach of Chinese Super League champion Guangzhou Evergrande.  Lippi, 64, signed a 2 1/2-year contract “in accordance
with the strategic needs of the club,” the team owned by
developer  Evergrande Real Estate Group (3333)  Ltd. said today in a
 statement , without giving salary details. Manager Lee Jang-Soo
was fired, the club said in a separate statement.  Lippi, who hasn’t coached since the 2010 World Cup, when
Italy failed to advance beyond the group stage, will be paid
about 10 million euros ($12.7 million) a season, Chinese
newspaper Titan Sports reported today.  China is starting to draw top talent as soccer club owners
increase spending on teams and the league’s image improves
following corruption scandals, match-fixing and violence on and
off the pitch. Former Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka moved to
Shanghai Shenhua in January with an annual wage of 10.6 million
euros, while Evergrande last year signed Dario Leonardo Conca,
the Argentine named the best soccer player in Brazil for two
consecutive years, for a Chinese record fee of $10 million.  Didier Drogba , another Chelsea striker, and former Real
Madrid midfielder Guti are among players considering offers from
Chinese clubs, according to Chinese media reports.  -- Alfred Cang  in Shanghai. Editors: Dan Baynes, Peter-Joseph
