Europe’s economy will begin to slowly
recover later this year, provided governments take action to
reduce debt, European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  said.  “A slow and subdued recovery will begin in the second
half, but that is only going to happen if decisive action” is
taken on public finances and “confidence eventually returns to
the European economy,” Rehn said today at an event in Oxford,
England.  He also praised Spain’s government for acting strongly to
bring down debt and shore up the nation’s lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
