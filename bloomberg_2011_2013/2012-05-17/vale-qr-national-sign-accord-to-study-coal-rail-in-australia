Vale SA (VALE) , the world’s biggest iron ore
shipper, and  QR National Ltd. (QRN)  signed an initial agreement to
study building rail roads to ship coal from planned Vale mines
in  Australia .  Vale and QR National, Australia’s biggest haulage company,
will study proposals to build rail links from the Galilee and
Bowen basins in Queensland state to coastal ports, Brisbane-
based QR National today said in an e-mailed statement.  Brazil’s Vale plans to develop a $10 billion coal project
in the Galilee basin to produce as much as 40 million metric
tons annually. The project, alongside others proposed by India’s
GVK Group and Asia’s richest woman,  Gina Rinehart , require a
500-kilometer (310-mile) railroad to the coast.  Mining companies are being forced to dig further inland to
profit from the rising consumption in China and India, the two
fastest-growing major economies. China will account for 63
percent of the increase in global coal demand through 2016, the
 International Energy Agency  said in a December report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
