Vietnam ’s two-year bonds rose on
speculation banks have surplus cash to invest. The dong was
little changed.  Lenders’ outstanding commercial loans dropped 1.71 percent
as of April 16 from the end of 2011, online news service Cafe F
reported last week, citing the National Financial Supervisory
Commission. Vietnam’s monetary authority said in February that
it was limiting business lending.  “Banks have abundant cash as they haven’t lent out too
much so far this year because of the central bank’s limited
credit-growth policy,” said Do Thi Phuong Trang, a Hanoi-based
analyst at Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam.
“That has left them with more money to buy  government bonds .”  The  yield  on two-year bonds fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 8.86 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 3:50 p.m. in
Hanoi after closing yesterday at 20,853, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the currency’s
reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the official fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
