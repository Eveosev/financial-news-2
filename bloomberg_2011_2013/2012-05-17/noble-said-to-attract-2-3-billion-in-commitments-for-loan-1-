Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) ’s loan has received
$2.314 billion in commitments and the commodities trader plans
to close the facility after it receives a response from one
final bank, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Singapore-listed Noble may sign the loan, which had an
original target size of $1.5 billion, next week, another person
familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified
because the details are private. The company began marketing the
loan in March after hiring 17 banks to help organize the
facility, according to a March 23 e-mailed statement.  Stephen Brown , Noble’s Hong Kong-based spokesman, declined
to comment on the financing when contacted by e-mail today.  Banks are invited to join in syndication with commitments
of $75 million or more for a so-called all-in fee of 190 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate on a 364-day
tranche and 290 basis points on a three-year portion, a third
person familiar with the matter said on March 23.  Lenders pledging $50 million to $74 million get an all-in
rate of 185 basis points and 283 basis points on the 364-day and
three-year portions respectively, the person said.  Banks committing $25 million to $49 million get an all-in
of 180 basis points and 277 basis points respectively while
those pledging less than $25 million get a rate of 170 basis
points and 270 basis points, the person said.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., ABN Amro Bank
