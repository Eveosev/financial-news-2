Militants including a suicide bomber
stormed the compound of the governor of  Afghanistan ’s western
Farah province, killing six police officers and a civilian, a
senior official said.  “The bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate of the
governor’s building, and three others were killed in gunfire
exchanges with Afghan police,” Mohammad Ghaus Malyar, deputy
police chief for the province, said by phone.  Twelve others, including four civilians, were wounded in
two hours of fighting, Malyar said. Farah, which borders  Iran ,
has been among the country’s more peaceful provinces. Taliban
spokesman  Zabihullah Mujahed  said by phone that the guerrilla
movement had carried out the attack.  The Taliban have frequently hit government compounds,
notably in the country’s south and in the capital, Kabul. Last
month, two Taliban fighters struck the governor’s office in
Kandahar, killing two policemen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
