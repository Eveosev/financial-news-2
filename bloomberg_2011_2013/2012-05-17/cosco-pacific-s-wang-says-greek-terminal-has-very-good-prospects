Wang Xingu, vice chairman and
managing director of  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , comments on the outlook
for the company’s container terminal in Piraeus,  Greece  amid
speculation the country may leave the euro area. He spoke to
reporters today in Hong Kong.  The Piraeus facility boosted volumes 154 percent in the
first four months of the year, and Cosco Pacific is pushing
ahead with expansion plans.  “No matter whether Greece pulls out of the euro zone or
not, it will not have a big impact on our terminal. We have very
good efficiency in handling cargo and the whole company has
solid fundamentals. Also, only a small proportion of containers
handled at the Piraeus facility are for the Greek market.  “Our terminal has a perfect location and there has been no
strike there, which helps us provide good and efficient services
to customers. The prospects for the terminal are very good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
