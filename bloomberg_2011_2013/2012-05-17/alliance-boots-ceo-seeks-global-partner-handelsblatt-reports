Alliance Boots Holdings Ltd. is
seeking a “global player” as a partner,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Stefano Pessina.  “I am thinking about a fusion or a partnership with a
global player,” Pessina said, according to an e-mailed preview
of an article to be published tomorrow.  The CEO said he would prefer partners in the areas of
distribution and pharmacies to an alliance with a consumer
company such as  Procter & Gamble (PG)  or a health services provider
such as Medco Health Solutions Inc., according to Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
