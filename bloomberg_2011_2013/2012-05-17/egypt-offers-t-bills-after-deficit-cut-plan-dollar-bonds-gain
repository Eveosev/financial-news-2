Egypt  will offer 6.5 billion Egyptian
pounds ($1.1 billion) of treasury bills today after the
government approved reducing the  budget deficit  next fiscal
year. The dollar bonds advanced.  The North African country will seek bids for six- and 12-
month securities valued at 3 billion pounds and 3.5 billion
pounds, respectively, according to central bank data on
Bloomberg. The average yield at last week’s sale of the six-
month notes climbed to 15.087 percent, the highest level since
Bloomberg started tracking the data in 2006. The one-year rate
increased to 15.85 percent.  The Cabinet said yesterday it approved a budget for the
year that starts in July that cuts the deficit to 7.6 percent of
gross domestic product compared with its 8.6 percent target this
year. Egypt is seeking economic growth of 4 to 4.5 percent next
year, Planning Minister Fayza Aboulnaga said May 14. The budget
still has to be approved by parliament and the military council
that took over executive powers after the ouster of President
 Hosni Mubarak  last year.  Egypt’s economy expanded 0.4 percent in the three months
through Dec. 31, compared with growth of 0.2 percent in the
previous quarter and 5.6 percent a year earlier, according to
the most recent official figures.  The yield on the Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 fell less than one basis point, or 0.01 of a percentage
point, to 6.99 percent at 11:21 a.m. in Cairo, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. That pared the rate’s increase
this week to nine basis points. The Egyptian pound weakened 0.1
percent to 6.0455 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
