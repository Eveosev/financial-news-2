The U.S. House Energy and Commerce
Committee approved legislation to study and delay Environmental
Protection Agency rules that would affect the price of gasoline.  The committee voted 28-13 today for the bill that would
prohibit the EPA from requiring reductions in greenhouse-gas
emissions from refineries or use of lower polluting sulfur in
gasoline while a government panel studies the effect of
regulations on prices.  The EPA hasn’t proposed either regulation, and Democrats
said it didn’t make sense that rules yet to be issued were
already pushing prices higher.  “This is a messaging bill that’s going nowhere,”
Representative Mike Doyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said at the
meeting before the vote. “I think we all understand what we’re
doing here now, because, we’re in the silly season.”  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.6
cent to $3.722 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA, the lowest
since Feb. 27. Gasoline is down 21.4 cents since reaching a 2012
high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
