Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the
nation’s third-largest lender by market value, rose the most in
three months after first-quarter net income advanced 29 percent.  The stock gained 3.1 percent to 13.45 shillings by the
3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital, its highest level since
March 23 and the biggest increase since Feb. 16.  Net income climbed to 1.97 billion shillings ($23 million)
in the three months through March from 1.53 billion shillings a
year earlier, the Nairobi-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. Net interest income, the amount banks earn
from interest charges on loans, increased 19 percent to 4.38
billion shillings, it said. Provisions for bad loans dropped 11
percent to 314 million shillings.  Earnings were supported by year-on-year growth in net
interest income and declining provisions for bad debt, Nairobi-
based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd. said today in an e-mailed
note.  For the full year through December, profit before tax will
probably grow 5.8 percent to 12.7 billion shillings “on the
back of improved cost-to-income ratio and growth in forex
income,” according to Kestrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
