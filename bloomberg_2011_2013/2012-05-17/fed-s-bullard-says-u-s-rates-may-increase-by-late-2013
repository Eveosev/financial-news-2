Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said economic reports this year have
been stronger than forecast and he expects the central bank to
raise its target rate by late 2013.  “Generally speaking, the  U.S. economy  has done better than
expected in the first part of 2012,” Bullard said today in
Louisville, Kentucky. “My own forecast has rates going up a
little sooner” than other central bankers, or “late 2013.”  Several Fed policy makers said slowing growth or higher
risks to their economic outlook could warrant additional action
to sustain the recovery, according to minutes of their April
meeting released yesterday. The  Federal Open Market Committee  on
April 25 reiterated its expectation that subdued inflation and
economic slack will probably warrant “exceptionally low levels
for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
