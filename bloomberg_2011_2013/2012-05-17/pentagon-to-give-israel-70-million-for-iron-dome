The U.S. will provide  Israel  with $70
million in assistance for its Iron Dome short-range missile
defense system, Pentagon officials said today.  U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  offered the assistance
to Israel’s Defense Minister  Ehud Barak , Pentagon spokeswoman
Tara Rigler said in a statement.  “My goal is to ensure Israel has the funding it needs each
year to produce these batteries that can protect its citizens,”
Panetta said in the statement. “That is why going forward over
the next three years, we intend to request additional funding
for Iron Dome, based on an annual assessment of Israeli security
requirements against an evolving threat.”  Pentagon spokesman  George Little  said the $70 million will
be requested in a formal “reprogramming” to Congress that, if
approved, will allow a shift of funds in this fiscal year to the
Iron Dome system. He said the funding levels for the next three
years have yet to be set.  The Pentagon in its fiscal 2013 request didn’t request any
specific funds for Iron Dome. The House Appropriations Committee
today in its approval of a $519 billion  defense budget  added
$680 million for the Iron Dome system. The money also was
authorized by the House Armed Services Committee in its version
of the fiscal 2013 defense bill the House is voting on this
week.  Iron Dome, built by Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense
Systems Ltd., went into operation a year ago and has proved
effective at intercepting short-range rockets, according to
Israeli and U.S. officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
