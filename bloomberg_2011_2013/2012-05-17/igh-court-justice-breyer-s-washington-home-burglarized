U.S. Supreme Court Justice  Stephen Breyer ’s Washington home was burglarized less than three months
after he and his wife were robbed on the Caribbean island of
Nevis by a man wielding a machete.  A housekeeper discovered the break-in on May 4, said  Kathy Arberg , the court’s spokeswoman. Arberg said she didn’t know
what was stolen from the house, though she said no court-related
materials were taken.  The burglary is being investigated by the Washington
Metropolitan Police Department, said Officer Paul Metcalf. The
incident was reported earlier by the Washington Post.  Breyer, 73, lives in the upscale neighborhood of Georgetown
while in Washington. He was appointed to the court in 1994 by
President  Bill Clinton .  On Feb. 9, Breyer, his wife and two guests were in the
justice’s vacation home on Nevis when they were confronted by
the intruder, who stole about $1,000. Nobody was injured in the
robbery, Arberg said at the time.  Supreme Court justices often aren’t accompanied by security
in their private activities. In 2004, Justice David Souter, now
retired, was mugged while jogging on a Washington street.
Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg ’s purse was snatched in 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
