Gold demand in China may surge as
much as 30 percent this year as rising incomes boost consumption,
helping the country topple  India  as the world’s largest bullion
market on an annual basis, according to the World Gold Council.  Demand, which rose to a record in the first quarter, may
gain to between 900 metric tons and 1,000 tons this year, from
769.8 tons in 2011,  Albert Cheng , Far East managing director at
the producer-funded group, said in an interview. Indian usage
may drop to 800 tons to 900 tons, from 933.4 tons, he said.  Higher demand in the world’s largest gold producer may help
arrest a slump in prices, which have plunged from last year’s
record as investors favored the dollar amid concern  Greece  may
quit the euro. Global gold demand fell 4.6 percent to 1,097.6
tons in the first quarter, the council said in a report today.  “We are confident China will become the largest source of
demand for gold this year,” Cheng said in  Singapore , restating
a council forecast made earlier in 2012. “Over the next two to
five years,  China  and India will go neck to neck and may account
for more than 50 percent of world demand.”  Immediate-delivery gold traded at $1,548.19 an ounce at
4:03 p.m. in Singapore. That’s down 1.2 percent this year, and
18.5 percent from the record close on Sept. 5. The price touched
$1,526.97 yesterday, the lowest level since December as the
Greek debt crisis sent the euro to a four-month low.  ‘Seek Cash’  “Investors are selling gold now to seek cash and rebalance
their investment portfolio because of concerns about the euro-
zone sovereign-debt crisis,” said Cheng, who’s been in the gold
industry since 1985. “The fundamental reasons for investing in
gold remain very strong, so these investors will return.”  Bullion has rallied for 11 years, gaining through the
financial crisis that started in 2008, as investors bought the
metal to protect their wealth from currency debasement and
inflation.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said in a May 9 report the
precious metal remains the so-called currency of last resort.  Demand in China totaled 255.2 tons in the three months to
March 31 from 232.5 tons a year earlier, the council said in the
report. Investment demand gained 13 percent, while jewelry
demand increased 7.9 percent to 156.6 tons, making China the
world’s largest jewelry market for a third quarter.  The council’s outlook for increased consumption in China
this year contrasts with the view from  Lao Feng Xiang Co. (900905) , the
mainland’s biggest gold-jewelry maker, which said this month the
country’s demand growth may stagnate in 2012.  ‘Increasing Wealth’  “The  increasing wealth  of the middle class is very
important,” Cheng said. “In the past 10 to 15 years, it had
reached first- and second-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai
and Hangzhou. We expect such wealth to reach 600 million people
in third-tier cities.”  The prospect of China becoming the largest bullion user
reflects the country’s economic ascendance. Per capita gross
domestic product has more than doubled since 2000, according to
World Bank data. The country is already the top consumer of
copper and biggest producer of steel.  In India, demand fell to 207.6 tons in the first quarter,
from 290.6 tons a year ago, after the government hiked taxes and
 import duties , the council said. Investment demand dropped 46
percent and jewelry demand fell 19 percent, it said. A drop in
annual demand this year would be the second straight fall.  “Consumers will adjust to the changes over time,” Cheng
said, adding that purchases in India are improving this month.
“In India, people buy gold for cultural and religious reasons -
- that won’t change.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
