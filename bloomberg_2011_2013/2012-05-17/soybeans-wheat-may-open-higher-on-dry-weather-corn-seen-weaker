What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that drier weather
may threaten production in the U.S. and China, spurring
increased overseas demand for U.S. supplies,  Jim Gerlach , the
president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana, said in a
telephone interview. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures
may open up $3 to $4 per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents higher on the CBOT,
the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  as dry weather threatens crops in parts of the U.S.,
Europe and Russia, increasing demand for supplies from the U.S,
the biggest global exporter, Gerlach said.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago on speculation that this weekâ€™s rally was
overdone, given that it is too early to assess damage from dry
weather until plants start to pollinate in June, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
