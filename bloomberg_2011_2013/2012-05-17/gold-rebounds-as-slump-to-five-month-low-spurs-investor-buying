Gold jumped the most since October as
a four-day slump and speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will
announce more stimulus for the  U.S. economy  boosted demand for
the precious metal.  The metal tumbled 3.7 percent in the past four sessions as
Greek politicians prepared for a second election, raising
concern that the country may exit the euro bloc. The
Philadelphia Fed’s general economic index, a gauge of regional
manufacturing, fell to minus 5.8 in May, signaling contraction.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey were expecting a rise to 10.  “People are coming back to gold as prices have fallen very
sharply,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a market strategist at Archer
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “Murmurs about the Fed looking at some kind of
easing because of soft U.S. data are gaining momentum, and
that’s good for gold as any kind of easing is inflationary.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose 2.5 percent to
$1,574.90 an ounce at 1:47 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . That’s
the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Oct. 25.
Yesterday, prices retreated to $1,526.70, the lowest since Dec.
29.  Silver futures for July delivery surged 3 percent to $28.02
an ounce, the biggest advance since April 12.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery rose 1.5 percent to $1,453.40 an ounce, and June
delivery palladium futures rose 2 percent to $605.85 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
