Contract workers staged protests at
Chilean copper mines today, blocking access roads at operations
run by state-owned Codelco, to push for increased  job security .  Codelco’s mining operations weren’t affected by groups of
protesters, a company official briefed on the matter said by
telephone, declining to be named citing company policy.
Codelco’s Andina division was “paralyzed” after employees of
contracted companies blocked access to shift workers, said
Claudio Valenzuela, a spokesman for the contract workers union.  Workers also marched along roads outside Codelco’s
Chuquicamata, Radomiro Tomic and Gaby mines and caused
interruptions at its Ventanas smelter, Valenzuela said by
telephone from Andina. The protests will be scaled down in the
coming hours, he said.  There were no protests at Collahuasi, the world’s third
biggest copper mine owned by  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA) ,
the operating company said in an e-mailed response to questions.
Marcelo Esquivel, a Santiago-based spokesman for Anglo American,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
