Yoox SpA (YOOX) , an Italian online fashion
retailer, rose the most in 2 1/2 years in Milan trading after
confirming that it’s in discussions to set up an e-commerce
joint venture with  PPR SA. (PP)   The venture will run the online sales of all of Paris-based
PPR’s luxury brands, including Gucci, a person with knowledge of
the talks told Bloomberg News yesterday, asking not to be named
because the matter is private. No definitive agreement has been
signed, Yoox said today in a statement.  Yoox gained as much as 16 percent to 11.54 euros, the
 steepest intraday advance  since Dec. 3, 2009. The shares were up
12 percent at 11.15 euros as of 3:36 p.m. in Milan.  PPR plans to have more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion)
of sales online by 2020. Yoox designs and manages e-commerce
sites for more than 30 fashion and luxury goods brands and sells
third-party products via the yoox.com, thecorner.com and
shoescribe.com online stores.  To contact the reporters on this story:
