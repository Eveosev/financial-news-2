Michael Owen  won’t be offered a new
contract to remain at Manchester United, the striker said on his
Twitter account.  Owen, 32, spent the past three seasons at United. He
appeared in just four games this season and none since November
because of a thigh injury.  “The manager informed me after our testimonial match on
Tuesday that the club would not be offering me a new contract,”
Owen said on Twitter. “I have loved every minute of the 3 years
I have spent at such a fantastic club.”  Owen scored 17 goals in 52 appearances after joining United
on a free transfer from Newcastle in 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
