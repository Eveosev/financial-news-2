The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars fell from a one-month high, according to a money-
market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 49 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, at
1:21 p.m. in London. The measure was minus 51 yesterday, the
highest cost since April 17.  The one-year basis swap was 67 basis points below Euribor
from minus 68 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for loans
over that period in euros, rose for the first time since Dec.
19. The measure climbed to 0.686 percent, from 0.685 percent.
One-week Euribor fell to 0.317 percent from 0.318 percent.  Predictions in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- signalled banks will become more reluctant to lend to
one another. The measure rose to 39 basis points from 38 basis
points, compared with a three-month high of 43 basis points on
May 14.  The Euribor/OIS spread was 38 basis points compared with
38.5 yesterday.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 785 billion euros ($999
billion) with the bank from 788 billion euros the day before.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged at 0.467 percent. The three-
month dollar  FRA/OIS spread  was 48 basis points from 47.5
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
