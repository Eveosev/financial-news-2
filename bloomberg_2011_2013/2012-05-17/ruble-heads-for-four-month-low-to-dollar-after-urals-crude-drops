The ruble fell against the dollar,
heading for its weakest in almost four months as oil,  Russia ’s
main export, sank.  The Russian currency depreciated for a 10th day, falling
0.9 percent to 31.19 per dollar as of 4:02 p.m. in Moscow and
extending its streak of losses to the longest since Dec. 14. The
country’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds due 2018 dropped, increasing
the yield by six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
3.747 percent.  Brent crude  retreated 0.6 percent to $109.08 per barrel
after the  European Central Bank  suspended lending to some Greek
institutions, fanning concern the region’s debt crisis will hurt
fuel demand as economic growth slows. Oil and gas together
contribute about 50 percent of Russia’s state revenue.  “We think it’s oversold and wait for a correction,”
Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign exchange at Otkritie
Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail. “We’re starting to buy
rubles.”  The 14-day relative strength index for the ruble’s rate
against the U.S. currency climbed to 83.371, the highest on a
closing basis since Sept. 26. A reading higher than 70 signals
the currency may have weakened too quickly and may rally.  The ruble declined 0.4 percent to 39.58 per euro and
depreciated 0.6 percent to 34.9571 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket. Investors increased bets on the
currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the
ruble at 31.7046 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 31.1615 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
