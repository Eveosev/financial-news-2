Warner Chilcott Plc (WCRX) , the maker of
dermatology and women’s health drugs, sued  Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  to prevent it from selling a generic
version of its oral contraceptive Lo Loestrin Fe.  Watson is seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval to sell a copy of the low-dose contraceptive, according
to a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Trenton, New
Jersey. Dublin-based Warner Chilcott said the Watson version
would infringe two patents and seeks a court order to prevent
sales until patents expire in July 2014 and February 2029.  The lawsuit follows Warner Chilcott’s announcement on April
30 that it is exploring options and holding preliminary talks
with buyers. Warner Chilcott had $2.7 billion  in revenue  last
year, with sales led by osteoporosis treatment Actonel, Asacol
for ulcerative colitis and Loestrin 24 FE, a low-dose birth-
control pill.  Under federal drug law, the filing of the lawsuit prevents
the FDA from granting Watson final approval for 30 months unless
a court rules in the generic-drug maker’s favor before then.  Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  Lo Loestrin Fe contains the active ingredients
norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol.  The case is Warner Chilcott v. Watson Laboratories, 12-cv-
2928, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton).  To contact the reporters on this story:
