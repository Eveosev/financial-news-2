The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will reduce shipments by 1.7 percent this
month as Asian refiners carry out seasonal maintenance,
according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC will export 23.88 million barrels a day in the four
weeks to June 2, compared with 24.3 million in the period to May
5, the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The data
exclude  Angola  and Ecuador. Shipments have dropped since April
21, when they reached their highest level since the Libyan
uprising began in February last year, according to the company.  “It’s essentially a decline in east-bound sailings from
the peak they hit in April, as the peak maintenance period is
this month,” Roy Mason, the company’s founder, said by
telephone from Halifax,  England . “But the bubble hasn’t
deflated and we’re still well above a year ago. Now we’re in the
second half of the quarter, which means from here it’s upwards
to the summer peak.”  Exports from the  Middle East , including non-OPEC members
Oman and Yemen, will decline 2.7 percent to 17.62 million
barrels a day in the four-week period, according to the report.  Crude on board tankers will average 484.2 million barrels,
down 5.6 percent from the month to May 5, Oil Movements said.
Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-rental
agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships as
floating storage.  OPEC’s members, which pump 40 percent of the world’s oil,
are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
