Greece’s credit rating was downgraded
one level by  Fitch Ratings  on “heightened risk” that the
country will not be able to sustain its membership of the euro
area after inconclusive elections left the country without a
stable government.  Greece was cut to CCC from B- by Fitch, according to an e-
mailed statement today in  London . The country’s ceiling was
revised to B-, Fitch said in the statement.  “The strong showing of ‘anti-austerity’ parties in the May
6 parliamentary elections and subsequent failure to form a
government underscores the lack of public and political support
for” the country’s bailout from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund , Fitch said in the statement. “In
the event that new general elections scheduled for June 17 fail
to produce a government with a mandate to continue with the EU-
IMF program of fiscal austerity and structural reform, an exit
of  Greece  from EMU would be probable.”  Greece swore in a caretaker prime minister, Panagiotis Pikrammenos yesterday, with the goal of steering the country to
fresh elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
