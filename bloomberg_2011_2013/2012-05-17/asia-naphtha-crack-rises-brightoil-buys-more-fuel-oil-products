Asia ’s naphtha crack spread rebounded,
signaling higher profits for refiners making the petrochemical
feedstock. Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. extended its fuel-
oil purchases in Singapore.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan  naphtha  to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose to $61.04 a metric ton at 4:58 p.m. Singapore time
from $49.37 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Yesterday’s crack spread was the narrowest since Nov. 28.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the biggest reported seller of 92-
RON gasoline in Singapore this month, sold 50,000 barrels to
Gunvor Group Ltd. at $117.46 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of traders who monitored transactions on the Platts
window. The cargo is for June 1 to June 5 loading. Shell sold
the same quantity for June 6 to June 10 to PetroChina Co. at
$117 a barrel.  PetroChina also bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON grade
loading June 1 to June 5 from Morgan Stanley at $117.50 a barrel,
the survey showed.  Fuel Oil  Brightoil bought three 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke
 fuel oil  from Gunvor, PetroChina and Vitol Group at $664,
$663.25 and $662.50 a ton, respectively, according to the
Bloomberg survey. The shipments are for June 1 to June 5, June 6
to June 10 and June 12 to June 16 loading. The Hong Kong-based
trader has purchased at least 540,000 tons so far this month in
Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Asian benchmark Dubai crude widened
59 cents to $4.63 a barrel at 2:54 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The
difference increased for the first time in four days, indicating
bigger losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade climbed $1 to $10.50 a ton, PVM said. This  viscosity
spread  widened the most since March 13, showing bunker, or
marine fuel, decreased more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Singapore’s onshore stockpiles of residual fuels fell to
18.37 million barrels in the week to yesterday, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. That’s the lowest in
four weeks.  Middle Distillates  The premium of  gasoil , or diesel, to Dubai crude rose 29
cents to $16.23 a barrel at 2:54 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM. That’s the widest  crack spread  so far this week.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil was at 65 cents a barrel, PVM
data showed. This  regrade  yesterday was the lowest in eight days,
signaling it was less profitable to make  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Refinery News  Bangchak Petroleum Pcl will shut its refinery for annual
maintenance from May 25 to June 23, according to President
Anusorn Sangnimnuan. The company plans to upgrade the plant’s
catalyst to improve product quality and raise production this
year to 98,000 barrels a day, he said.  Tenders  Bharat Petroleum Corp. offered to sell 10,000 tons of
naphtha for in June loading from Haldia, said two traders who
declined to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak with the media.  PV Oil Corp. in  Vietnam  sought to buy May and June
shipments of gasoil with 0.05 percent sulfur, the company said
in a document e-mailed to potential suppliers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
