In the race to map Earth from space,
 GeoEye Inc. (GEOY) ’s bid to swallow DigitalGlobe Inc. has left its own
valuation at the lowest in three years. That could compel GeoEye
to try and sell itself instead.  GeoEye, which supplies satellite images to customers such
as  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and the U.S. Defense Department, fell 21 percent
through yesterday after DigitalGlobe this month rejected an
unsolicited offer of $17 a share in cash and stock. GeoEye
traded at 8.4 times earnings, the lowest since the financial
crisis erupted in 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While GeoEye Chief Executive Officer Matt O’Connell went
public with the proposal after DigitalGlobe countered with a
takeover offer of its own, Oscar Gruss & Son Inc. says
 DigitalGlobe (DGI) , which is about 69 percent larger and worth seven
times as much relative to profit, has more leverage as a buyer.
Without a deal, GeoEye may cost shareholders more money as the
U.S. considers cuts to a $7.4 billion satellite imagery program
that provides GeoEye with more revenue, Tullett Prebon Plc said.  GeoEye is like a “minnow swallowing a whale,” Yemi Oshodi,
New York-based managing director of M&A and special situations
trading at WallachBeth Capital LLC, said in a telephone
interview. “It makes no sense to use your lower valued currency
to buy a higher valued currency.”  Mark Seifert, a spokesman for Herndon, Virginia-based
GeoEye, declined to comment on whether it would consider putting
itself up for sale. Eric Brielmann, a spokesman for DigitalGlobe,
declined to comment beyond the Longmont, Colorado-based
company’s May 6 statement. In it, DigitalGlobe said the bid
“substantially undervalues” the company.  Acquisition Detail  Today, GeoEye rose 0.5 percent to $19.65 a share as of 9:50
a.m. in  New York .  GeoEye offered to pay $8.50 in cash and 0.3537 shares for
each DigitalGlobe share to create the world’s largest
commercial-imagery satellite company. The proposal, 33 percent
above DigitalGlobe’s 20-day average, valued DigitalGlobe at $762
million, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Including  net debt ,
the deal was worth $1.04 billion.  GeoEye, with $437 million in market value, announced its
bid this month after twice rejecting a counteroffer from
DigitalGlobe, according to DigitalGlobe’s statement. After
GeoEye expressed interest in acquiring DigitalGlobe in February,
DigitalGlobe offered to buy GeoEye on March 2 in a deal that
would have given GeoEye holders 40 percent of the combined
company. The offer was repeated April 13.  Defense Spending  While DigitalGlobe had fallen 3.6 percent since turning
down the bid, GeoEye lost about a  fifth  of its value. GeoEye
ended at $19.55 yesterday, bringing shareholder losses to 43
percent in the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
DigitalGlobe fell by 33 percent in the same span.  The slump drove down GeoEye’s price-earnings ratio to the
lowest since December 2008, three months after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. collapsed in the biggest bankruptcy in history.  The GeoEye bid resembles a so-called  Pac-Man defense , a
strategy where a target fends off an unwanted takeover by buying
the acquirer and named after a popular 1980s video-arcade game,
showing GeoEye is worried cuts in U.S. defense spending will
lead to further share declines without a deal, said  Louis Meyer ,
a New York-based special situations analyst at Oscar Gruss.  The U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency awarded
contracts in August 2010 worth $3.8 billion to GeoEye and $3.5
billion to DigitalGlobe for the development of EnhancedView, a
program that will provide commercial satellite imagery to the
defense and intelligence communities for 10 years.  Relative Value  As the Defense Department considers “major” spending
reductions to the program, some investors are concerned that
GeoEye may face a greater revenue drop because it was allotted
more money, according to Dougherty & Co.  GeoEye also has fewer  satellites  orbiting the earth and 650
million square kilometers (251 million square miles) of imagery,
less than one-third the size of DigitalGlobe’s library, the
companies’ statements showed.  DigitalGlobe, which ended talks with GeoEye and will wait
until the U.S. decides whether to make cuts to EnhancedView
before considering another bid for GeoEye, said this month the
government process would be “favorable to the company.”  The statement indicates DigitalGlobe is confident it can
weather a reduction in spending better than GeoEye or enable it
to buy GeoEye at a lower price, according to Paul Coster, a New
York-based analyst for JPMorgan Chase & Co. It also shows that
GeoEye could be forced to consider giving up control if it wants
to provide a return to shareholders, Oscar Gruss’s Meyer said.  ‘The Other Asset’  GeoEye’s proposal “was more a sign of weakness than of
strength, leveraging this government funding cut as the
rationale,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s really
DigitalGlobe’s for the taking. They have the upper hand here.”  Amy Yong, a New York-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.,
says that while defense spending cuts will hurt both companies,
GeoEye has the financial wherewithal to persuade DigitalGlobe
shareholders to support the deal because it is  backed  by
Cerberus Capital Management LP.  Cerberus, the $20 billion New York-based private-equity
firm led by  Stephen Feinberg , owned 21 percent of GeoEye as of
March 31 and is “prepared to contribute substantial capital in
support” of the DigitalGlobe takeover, GeoEye said this month.  “The deal makes a lot of sense” for GeoEye as the
acquirer, Yong said in a telephone interview. Because Cerberus
is GeoEye’s biggest shareholder, “they’re probably a little bit
more well-positioned to do an acquisition.”  With investors putting a premium on owning DigitalGlobe,
WallachBeth’s Oshodi still says that GeoEye’s shareholders may
be better served if the company sells itself to its larger rival.  DigitalGlobe sold for 61 times earnings yesterday, versus
8.4 times for GeoEye, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Why would I take GeoEye’s stock knowing that their stock
is lower and could be lower?”  Sachin Shah , a  Jersey City , New
Jersey-based merger arbitrage strategist at Tullett Prebon, said
in a telephone interview. “There are two assets and one asset
is worth more and going to be less detrimentally affected by the
government cuts. It seems like GeoEye is the other asset.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
