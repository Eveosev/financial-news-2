Three Turkish soldiers were killed in
a clash with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, in the
southeast during a routine operation, the Hatay province’s
governorship said in a  statement  on its website.  Fighting broke out at about 7:45 a.m. today, it said.
Security forces are seeking to capture the insurgents, the
governorship said. Istanbul-based NTV news channel earlier
reported that two soldiers were killed and one wounded.  The PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by
 Turkey , the U.S. and the European Union, has been fighting for
autonomy in the southeast since 1984 in a conflict that has
claimed more than 40,000 lives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
