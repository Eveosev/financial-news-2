Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures increased from a record low as retail sales rose in
March at the fastest annual pace in two years, stoking concern
inflation will accelerate.  Futures yields rose for the first time in six days on
speculation further cuts in borrowing costs will be carried out
“with parsimony,” as the central bank said in minutes to its
April 17-18 meeting.  Brazil ’s real advanced on the evidence of
consumer strength after falling this week to 2 per dollar for
the first time in almost three years.  “This was not a weak number,” Luis Otavio de Souza Leal,
chief economist at Banco ABC Brasil SA, said by phone from Sao
Paulo. “If there isn’t a breakdown in  Europe , a continuation of
the central bank’s parsimony will be valid.”  The yield on the interest-rate futures contract due in
January, the most actively traded today, rose four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.83 percent at 1:30 p.m. in Sao
Paulo after reaching a record low 7.77 percent yesterday. The
real appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.9958 per  U.S. dollar  after
touching 2.0080 yesterday, the weakest level since July 2009.  The central bank has reduced Brazil’s target lending rate
by 3.5 percentage points since Aug. 31 to 9 percent, the most
among the world’s 25 largest economies, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Policy makers may reduce the benchmark
below the record low 8.75 percent to 8 percent by the end of
August 2012, trading in interest-rate futures shows.  Rate Cut Cycle  The yield on the interest-rate futures contract due in 2014
has tumbled 55 basis points this month as political instability
in Europe fueled speculation Brazil’s central bank will lengthen
the interest-rate cutting cycle that began in August.  High  interest rates  that are “incompatible” with the rest
of the world pose an obstacle to faster economic growth,
President  Dilma Rousseff  said May 15 in Brasilia.  The volume of retail sales rose 12.5 percent in March from
a year earlier, the fastest pace since March 2010, the national
statistics agency said today in  Rio de Janeiro . The median
forecast of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was for an
increase of 11.7 percent.  Economists covering Brazil’s economy raised their forecast
for 2012 inflation in Brazil to 5.22 percent from 5.12 percent a
week earlier, according to the median estimate in a May 11
central bank survey of about 100 economists published this week.
The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus
2 percentage points.  The real dropped 0.3 percent earlier today after Rousseff
said this week that the currency is “extremely overvalued.”
The currency has traded weaker than 1.90 per dollar since April
30 as the central bank bought $7.2 billion in the  spot market  in
April, the most since $8.4 billion purchased in March 2011.  “The market continues to be very volatile,” Hideaki Iha,
a currency trader at Fair Corretora de Cambio e Valores, said by
phone from  Sao Paulo . “Problems in Greece and  Spain  are
worsening.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
