Iraq will increase its daily exports
of Basrah Light crude from the  Persian Gulf  by 20 percent in the
second half of May from a month earlier, a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The Gulf state will ship 26 cargoes from the Basrah Oil
Terminal, seven more than a month earlier, the plan showed.
Exports will total 40.43 million barrels, or 2.53 million
barrels a day, compared with 2.1 million a day in the second
half of April.  The program comprises 15 consignments of 2 million barrels
each, nine 1 million-barrel lots and two shipments of 715,000
barrels.  Iraq started operating a second offshore mooring facility
for crude exports from the Persian Gulf on April 20. The new
single-point unit with the capacity to handle 900,000 barrels a
day is the second of four planned.  A third mooring facility will be ready “within a few
months” and would be used if exports increase, Dhia Jaafar,
director general of Southern Oil Co., said on April 20. Deputy
Prime Minister for Energy Affairs Hussain al-Shahristani said in
December that a fourth unit will be in place next year.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
