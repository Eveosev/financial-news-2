Federal Grid Co.,  Russia ’s state
monopoly for high-voltage power transmission, is considering a
debut sale of ruble Eurobonds as early as this year to fund
network upgrades.  Federal Grid “doesn’t exclude” selling some ruble-
denominated Eurobonds this year, Financial Director Egor
Prokhorov said in a telephone interview on May 15. The board
approved a program to sell as much as 100 billion rubles ($3.2
billion) of Eurobonds, according to its website.  Russia’s sovereign 2018 ruble-denominated Eurobonds fell
yesterday, pushing the yield up six basis points to 7.147
percent. Sovereign domestic bonds, known as OFZs, with the same
maturity yielded 8.07 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Such a difference in rates creates an incentive to try borrowing
rubles abroad rather than at home, according to Federal Grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
