Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s antibiotic Zithromax
and its generic competitors carry a “small increase” in the
risk of cardiovascular death compared with another common
antibiotic, a study found.  The pills, which are used to treat infections, caused a
“small absolute increase in cardiovascular deaths” among
patients, particularly those who had a higher chance of heart
problems, according to the  study  published today in the New
England Journal of Medicine.  The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  “is reviewing the
results from this study and will communicate any new information
that results,” the agency said in a statement posted on its
website.  The study looked at 350,000 patient prescriptions for
azithromycin taken by people in  Tennessee  covered by Medicaid,
the state-U.S. health program for the poor. The research showed
that 85 of every 1 million treatment courses of the drug were
associated with cardiac death. That’s more than twice the rate
on the antibiotic amoxicillin, according to the study.  “We are thoroughly reviewing this observational study
within the overall context of the data we’ve collected for more
than two decades on Zithromax’s benefits and risks,” Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Zithromax generated about $453 million for Pfizer last
year. The drug no longer has patent protection and generic
versions also are sold. The medicine is prescribed in patients
to treat bacterial infections of the respiratory system and
urinary tract and for tonsillitis.  Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $22.56 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
