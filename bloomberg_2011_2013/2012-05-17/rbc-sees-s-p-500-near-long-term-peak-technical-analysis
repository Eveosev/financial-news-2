A long-term peak in the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  is developing as the gauge diverges from other
equity measures, meaning stocks are likely to decline next year,
according to RBC Capital Markets.  While the S&P 500 surpassed its 2011 high last month, other
stock measures including the  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  of small U.S.
companies and the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  failed to reach
last year’s peaks, sending a warning sign, according to a May
15 report from RBC’s Robert Sluymer.  “The MSCI and Russell didn’t confirm the S&P’s new cycle
highs,” Sluymer, a technical analyst at RBC in New York, said
during a phone interview yesterday. “These are the types of
divergences you start to get as market tops develop.”  At the same time, the index may rebound in the next few
weeks after reaching its “support band” of 1,300 to 1,330,
Sluymer said in the May 15 report. The S&P 500 fell 6.6 percent
between April 2 and yesterday, when it closed at 1,324.80.  Cyclical companies are showing no signs of a reversal even
though they appear “oversold,” Sluymer said.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
and  Joy Global Inc. (JOY)  are two examples of economic-sensitive
companies that have shown no evidence of bottoming, he said.  “We’re working through a much bigger top here,” he said
in the interview. “We’re already seeing the market rotating
away from cyclical leadership towards defensive themes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
