     May 17 (Bloomberg)  -- Manchester Unitedâ€™s third-quarter
profit fell 8.5 percent as the Premier League soccer club got
less in matchday and media revenue.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization declined to 20.4 million pounds ($32.4 million) in
the three months ended March 31, compared with EBITDA of 22.3
million pounds in the year-earlier period, MU Finance Plc said
today in a preliminary results statement.  The record 19-time English champion finished second this
season, behind  Manchester City  on goal difference. Total sales
in the quarter fell 5.9 percent to 70.8 million pounds.
Commercial revenue rose 15 percent as the club benefited from
sponsorships.  United reduced debt by 61.2 million pounds to 423.3 million
pounds in the quarter, leaving it with 25.6 million pounds in
cash and equivalents at the end of the period.  The team now owns 92.3 million pounds of its senior secured
notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
