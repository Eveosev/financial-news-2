Argentina ’s Petersen Group, which
owns a 25 percent stake in  YPF SA (YPFD) , ceased payments on $500
million of debt with banks, newspaper El Cronista reported,
citing executives at the energy company it didn’t name.  The banks may take the YPF stake to pay for the debt, El
Cronista said. The Petersen Group was trying to delay payments
until there was more clarity on YPF’s status after Argentina
nationalized 51 percent of the company in April, Cronista said.  The Argentine group, owned by the Eskenazi family, received
$1.018 billion from Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Banco Itau Europa and BNP Paribas SA, and $1.015 billion
from Spain’s  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  in 2008 when it acquired 14.09
percent of YPF, Buenos Aires-based Cronista said.  Standard Bank Group Ltd., Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse and
Repsol lent it $670 million when it acquired an additional 10
percent of oil producer YPF in 2011, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
