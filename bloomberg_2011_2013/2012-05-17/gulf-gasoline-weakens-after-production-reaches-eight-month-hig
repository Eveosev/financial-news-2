Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened after
refinery processing in the region reached the highest level
since September.  Gross input at the plants increased 377,000 barrels a day,
or 5 percent, last week, the Energy Department said yesterday.
It was the largest amount since Sept. 2, department data showed.  The discount for regular 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf
Coast widened 1.37 cents to 15 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:04 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
5.31 cents to $2.7316 a gallon.  The same fuel in New York Harbor strengthened 0.12 cent to
a discount of 4.63 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
