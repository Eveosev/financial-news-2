Suning Appliance Co. (002024)  and BYD Co.
paced gains on speculation demand will increase after China
announced new subsidies for the consumer electronics and
automobile industries.  Suning, China’s biggest electronics retailer by market
value, rallied 1.65 percent to 9.87  yuan  at the close of trading
in Shenzhen. BYD gained 4 percent to 25.12 yuan, snapping seven
days of losses. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index climbed
1.4 percent, the most in two weeks, and the CSI 300 Index added
1.5 percent.  China will allocate 26.5 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) in
subsidies to promote the use of energy-saving household
appliances and products, according to a  statement  posted on the
government’s website yesterday, citing a State Council meeting
at which Premier  Wen Jiabao  presided. The nation will allocate a
further 6 billion yuan of subsidies for purchases of vehicles
with engines of less than 1.6 liters, according to the
statement.  “Given the downturn in industry demand, the new policies
will help to underpin profitability at these companies,” Ji Min, a consumer analyst at China Merchants Securities Co. in
Shenzhen, said in a report.  Appliances eligible for subsidies include air conditioners,
flat-panel television sets, refrigerators, washing machines and
water heaters that meet energy-efficiency standards, the
government said in the release.  The new subsidies replace a government program that gave
shoppers as much as 400 yuan toward the purchase of new home
appliances. The old incentives, which expired Dec. 31, drove the
sales of electronics retailers including Suning and  Gome
Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. (493)  for two years.  Light Bulbs, LEDs  Gome jumped 2.4 percent to HK$1.26 in  Hong Kong  trading
today.  Skyworth Digital Holdings Ltd. (751) , a maker of televisions
and other electronics, surged 11 percent to HK$3.41.  China will also earmark 2.2 billion yuan to promote the use
of energy-saving light bulbs and LEDs and 1.6 billion yuan for
the purchase of “highly efficient” electrical machinery,
according to yesterday’s statement.  China’s growth rate slowed to 8.1 percent in the first
quarter from 11.9 percent two years ago. Retail sales gained
14.1 percent in April from a year earlier, the least since
February 2009. That compared with estimates of 15.1 percent and
March’s 15.2 percent increase. Passenger-vehicle sales rose 1.9
percent in the first four months of the year, according to the
 china  Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  The auto stimulus announced yesterday is about half the
amount spent by the government in 2010 to boost buying of such
fuel efficient cars, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. China
spent $12 billion yuan on a program offering a 3,000 yuan
subsidy on the sale of each fuel-efficient car with engines
smaller than 1.6 litres, analysts Zhixuan Lin and  Janet Lewis 
said in a report today. The subsidies ended in October last
year.  Slowing Sales  “The government knows this year passenger vehicle sales
will be slow and the economy is slowing,” said Alice Leung,
deputy head of research at ICBC International Research Ltd.
“They also do not want idle resources and overcapacity in the
industry.”  SAIC Motor Corp. rose 2.25 percent in Shanghai trading.
 Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175)  advanced 2.3 percent to HK$2.62,
Dongfeng Motor Group Co. was up 2.3 percent to HK$13.30, and
 Great Wall Motor Co. (2333)  stock jumped 5.8 percent to HK$15.32 in
Hong Kong.  --Liza Lin, Huiwen Yang. Editors: Shiyin Chen, Linus Chua  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
