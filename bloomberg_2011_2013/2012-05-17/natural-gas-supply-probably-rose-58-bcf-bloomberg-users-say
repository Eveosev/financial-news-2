The U.S. Energy Departmentâ€™s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 2.2 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  Inventories gained 58 billion cubic feet in the week ended
May 11 to 2.66 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for June delivery fell 4.3 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.575 per million British thermal units on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange at 10:26 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
