Endesa SA (ELE)  will reconsider an ongoing
investment of 500 million euros in two dams in the Mondego river
in northern Portugal,  Diario de Noticias  reported, citing Nuno Ribeiro da Silva, who heads the utility’s Portuguese unit.  Endesa had already announced it would stop its Pego power
plant after the government decided to suspend so-called capacity
guarantee payments, the Portuguese newspaper said. The
suspension of the payments was a measure included in Portugal’s
financial aid program, Noticias reported.  The decision also affects  EDP-Energias de Portugal SA ’s
power plants in Lares, Ribatejo and Alqueva, according to
Noticias.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
