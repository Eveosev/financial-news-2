Senator  David Vitter  said he opposes
President Barack Obama’s two nominees to the  Federal Reserve 
Board, saying they would probably back the current “dangerous”
central bank policy of keeping interest rates near zero.  “This Federal Reserve has set essentially a zero interest
rate policy, an extremely easy money policy, for an extended
period of time, a very long period of time, without any end in
sight,” said Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, during a Senate
debate today. Lawmakers are considering the nominations of
 Jeremy Stein , a Harvard University professor and Jerome Powell,
an attorney and private equity investor who was a Treasury
undersecretary for President George H.W. Bush.  “There are many experts, economists, commentators, who
think this is very dangerous policy and I share their
concerns,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
