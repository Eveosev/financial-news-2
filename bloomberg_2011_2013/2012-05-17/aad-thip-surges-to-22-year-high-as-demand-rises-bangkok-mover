Haad Thip Pcl (HTC) , a Thai bottler of
 Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  beverages, surged to the highest level in almost
22 years in Bangkok trading on speculation increased demand for
its products will boost earnings.  The shares  climbed  by the 30 percent daily limit to 20.10
baht at the close on the Thai stock exchange, the highest level
since July 1990. The stock was the second-biggest  gainer  in the
 SET Index (SET) , which rose 0.2 percent.  Haad Thip and other Thai consumer-related companies are
benefiting from a revival in domestic consumption as the nation
recovers from its worst floods in almost 70 years in 2011. The
company said on May 15 net income in the first quarter surged
sixfold to 46.5 million baht ($1.5 million) as sales increased
26 percent.  “Haad Thip is a good story of swift earnings turnaround as
the Thai economy is quickly recovering from the floods,”
Adithep Vanabriksha, who oversees about $800 million of Thai
equities including Haad Thip shares for  Aberdeen Asset
Management Plc (ADN) , said by phone today from Bangkok.  Haad Thip, which owns a license from Coca-Cola to sell soft
drinks in the country’s 14 southern provinces, reported a 43
percent slide in 2011 profit. Thailand’s central bank raised
this month its 2012 economic growth forecast to 6 percent from a
previous estimate of 5.7 percent.  Adithep’s  Aberdeen Small Cap Fund (ABESMF)  holds a 1 percent stake
in Haad Thip, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg, while
Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft-drink maker, has a 24
percent stake.  Phairoch Rattakul, Haad Thip’s chief executive officer, was
not immediately available for comment after a call to his
office.  -- Editors: Richard Frost,  Matthew Oakley   To contact the reporter on this story:
