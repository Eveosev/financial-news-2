Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s
shareholders should oppose the bank’s plan for a reverse stock
split and its remuneration report, said Pensions & Investment
Research Consultants Ltd., a corporate-governance adviser.  Investors in Britain’s largest state-controlled bank should
oppose the pay report because the long-term bonus awarded to
Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  was “excessive,” the
adviser said in a letter to members yesterday.  Hester, who gave up a 963,000-pound bonus amid pressure
from parliamentarians, could be awarded as much as about 10.1
million shares of the bank under a so-called long-term incentive
performance-related plan through March 2014, according to the
bank’s annual report. Shareholders should also oppose RBS’s
annual report stock split because of the accounting standards
the bank uses, it said.  RBS, which is 82 percent government-owned, holds its annual
general meeting on May 30 and will ask investors to approve a
reverse stock split, giving them one new share for every 10 they
hold to reduce the shares’ volatility.  A spokesman for RBS declined to comment.  -- Editors: Jon Menon,  Keith Campbell   To contact the reporter on this story:
