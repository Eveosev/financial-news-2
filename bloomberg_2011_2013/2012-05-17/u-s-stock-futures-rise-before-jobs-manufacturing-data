The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
tumbled to a four-month low on disappointing economic data and
concern that credit ratings for Spanish banks would be cut.  Nine out of 10  S&P 500  groups fell amid weaker-than-
forecast data on manufacturing in the Philadelphia region and
U.S. leading indicators.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. slid at least 4.3 percent to pace losses in the largest
companies.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  sank 2.9 percent, sending its market value
below $500 billion.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  raised $16 billion in the
biggest initial public offering by a technology company in
history, pricing shares at the top end of an increased range.  The S&P 500 fell 1.5 percent to 1,304.86 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 156.06 points, or
1.2 percent, to 12,442.49. The Nasdaq-100 Index sank 2.1 percent
to 2,509.05, falling for an  eighth day  in the longest slump
since 2010. The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  of small companies slipped
2.3 percent to 754.33. About 8.3 billion shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, or 24 percent above the three-month average.  “Investors are de-risking,” said Tim Hoyle, the director
of research at Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Haverford Trust Co.,
which manages about $6.5 billion. “They look at a global
situation that appears to be degrading, not improving.”  Concern about a world economic slowdown drove the S&P 500
down 3.9 percent in five days. Banco Santander SA was among 16
Spanish banks whose credit ratings were cut by Moody’s Investors
Service, which cited economic weakness and the government’s
mounting budget strain. The announcement came after the market
close, confirming investor speculation.  Bear Market  Both Russia’s Micex Index and  Brazil (IBOV) ’s Bovespa index fell
more than 20 percent from their previous peaks, entering a bear
market. The S&P 500 has fallen 8.1 percent from an almost four-
year high on April 2. The Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, which measures the cost of using options as
insurance against S&P 500 losses, soared 10 percent to 24.49,
the highest since Dec. 19.  Consumer discretionary, financial and raw material shares
had the  biggest losses  in the S&P 500 among 10 groups. The
Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to the
economy slumped 2.3 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average sank 3.2 percent. The KBW Bank Index fell 1.7 percent. A
measure of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes tumbled 6 percent. The
Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index slipped 5.6 percent.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, sank 4.4 percent to $87.80.  JPMorgan (JPM)  retreated 4.3
percent to $33.93.  Apple Tumbles  Apple lost 2.9 percent to $530.12, sending its market value
to $495.7 billion. The company’s market capitalization had
topped  $500 billion  for the first time in February, cementing
its lead as the world’s most valuable business and reaching
heights not seen by any company since the last recession.  SAC Capital Advisors LP and Viking Global Investors LP were
among hedge funds that sold a net 6.1 million shares of Apple
last quarter, taking advantage of the 48 percent jump in the
iPhone maker’s stock. The stock has fallen 17 percent from its
peak in April.  Hedge funds accounted for more than a third of the 15.2
million net  Apple shares  that were sold by endowments, banks,
insurance companies and other investors during the first
quarter, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg, which was
aggregated from regulatory filings. Even so, Apple remains hedge
funds’ most valuable holding. As a group they controlled 37.8
million shares as of March 31.  ‘Hedge-Fund Favorite’  “Apple has always been a hedge-fund favorite,” said
Michael Binger, a senior portfolio manager at Gradient
Investments LLC in Shoreview, Minnesota, which oversees about
$225 million. “You’re seeing some locking in of profits.”  Facebook sold 421.2 million shares at $38 each, a statement
today shows. That values the social network at $104.2 billion,
making it the largest company to go public in the U.S. by market
capitalization, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
Dealogic. Facebook, led by 28-year-old  Mark Zuckerberg , this
week expanded the IPO to meet demand, allowing investors Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Accel Partners to reap more gains.  “My feeling is they could have gone higher, but they
wanted to leave some room for upside tomorrow,” said  Arvind Bhatia , an analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc. in Dallas.
“The demand was obviously quite strong so I think it’s the
right move.”  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  retreated 6.5 percent,
the biggest decline since Oct. 3, to $28.47. The Federal Reserve
Bank of New York postponed the sale of assets acquired in the
company’s rescue.  Victoria’s Secret  Limited Brands Inc. (LTD)  lost 4.4 percent to $45.86. The owner
of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain forecast earnings for
the second quarter and full year that trailed estimates.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  rallied 4.2 percent, the most since
2009, to $61.68. The world’s largest retailer reported first-
quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates as its low prices
increased customer traffic and boosted sales.  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  gained 3.1 percent to $52.42. The
retailer controlled by  Edward Lampert  reported first-quarter net
income of $189 million after selling stores and said it would
partially spin off its Canadian operations.  Gold producers rallied after the precious metal jumped the
most since October as speculation that the Federal Reserve will
announce more stimulus boosted demand.  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the
largest U.S. gold producer, added 4 percent to $45.26.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  advanced 0.1 percent to $22.06, after
falling as much as 1 percent. The company is considering cutting
as many as 25,000 jobs, or 8 percent of its work force, to
reduce costs and help the company contend with ebbing demand for
computers and services, people briefed on the plans said.  Long-Term Peak  A long-term peak in the S&P 500 is developing as the gauge
diverges from other equity measures, meaning stocks are likely
to decline next year, according to  RBC Capital Markets .  While the S&P 500 surpassed its 2011 peak last month, other
stock measures including the Russell 2000 Index of small U.S.
companies and the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  failed to reach
last year’s levels, sending a warning sign, according to a May
15 report from RBC’s Robert Sluymer.  “The MSCI and Russell didn’t confirm the S&P’s new cycle
highs,” Sluymer, a technical analyst at RBC in New York, said
during a phone interview yesterday. “These are the types of
divergences you start to get as market tops develop.”  At the same time, the index may rebound in the next few
weeks after reaching its “support band” of 1,300 to 1,330,
Sluymer said in the May 15 report.  Cyclical companies are showing no signs of a reversal even
though they appear “oversold,” Sluymer said. Caterpillar and
 Joy Global Inc. (JOY)  are two examples of economic-sensitive companies
that have shown no evidence of bottoming, he said.  “We’re working through a much bigger top here,” he said
in the interview. “We’re already seeing the market rotating
away from cyclical leadership towards defensive themes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
