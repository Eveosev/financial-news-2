South Africa , the continent’s biggest
corn producer, will probably lower its forecast for this
season’s harvest by 1.4 percent, a survey showed.  The government may say farmers will reap 10.95 million
metric tons of corn, compared with an April 24 forecast of 11.1
million tons, according to the median estimate of eight traders
surveyed by Bloomberg. Forecasts ranged from 10.8 million tons
to 11.1 million tons.  The government’s Crop Estimates Committee announces its
projection on May 24 at 3:30 p.m. in Pretoria.  White corn declined 0.2 percent to 2,079 rand ($250) a ton
by the close in Johannesburg. The yellow variety, used as  animal
feed , rose for a fourth day by 0.1 percent to 2,040 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
