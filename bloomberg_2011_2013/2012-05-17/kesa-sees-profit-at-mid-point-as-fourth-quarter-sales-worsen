Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA) , the owner of
the Darty electronics retailer, said annual profit will be at
the “mid-point” of investor expectations after reporting sales
worsened as it sold fewer televisions.  Revenue at stores open at least a year declined 5.9 percent
in the period from Jan. 9 to April 30, Kesa said in a statement.
That compares to the average estimate of 5 analysts for a 5.3
percent fall, and is worse than the prior quarter’s 1.3 percent
decline. Full-year adjusted profit before tax will be “around
the mid-point of the range of current market expectations.”  Television sales fell by more than 30 percent because of
the switchover to digital last year, London-based Kesa said. The
retailer announced earlier this month that more tie-ups could be
on the agenda after it agreed to sell 99.9 percent of its
telecommunications unit to Bouygues SA,  France ’s third-largest
mobile-phone operator, for 40 million euros ($51 million). It
sold its U.K. Comet business in February.  “Since last reporting in January, trading conditions have
been volatile and have remained weak in most of our markets,
particularly in Vision and in Italy and  Spain ,” Chief Executive
Officer Thierry Falque-Pierrotin said.  Kesa shares fell 3.4 percent to 54.1 pence in  London 
trading yesterday. The stock has declined 19.6 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
