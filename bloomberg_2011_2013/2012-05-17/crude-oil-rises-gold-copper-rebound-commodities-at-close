The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities climbed 0.4 percent to 635.62 at 4:45 p.m.
 Singapore  time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
rose 0.4 percent to 1,500.8022.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose from the lowest settlement in six months in New
York after economic data in  Japan  beat estimates and technical
indicators signaled declines in crude prices may be exaggerated.  Crude for June delivery rose as much as 91 cents to $93.72
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $93.25 at 3:04 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday fell 1.2 percent to $92.81, the lowest close
since Nov. 2. Prices are down 5.7 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures climbed for a third day in  New York  as
predictions of rising temperatures signaled increased demand for
the fuel for cooling.  Futures rose as much as 1.2 percent after settling
yesterday at the highest level in almost 12 weeks. A “surge of
warming” in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic states will occur over
the next six to 10 days, Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda,
 Maryland , forecast. Prices have rebounded 39 percent since
dropping to a 10-year low last month, on speculation electricity
generators will burn a record amount of gas this year.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 10 cents to $15.84 a barrel at 12:15 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, narrowed for
the third time in four days. Gasoil swaps for June dropped 80
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $122.10 a barrel, PVM data showed.
That’s the lowest since Dec. 27.  Naphtha swaps for June declined $6, or 0.7 percent, to $885
a metric ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical feedstock is
down for a 16th day, the longest losing streak in records going
back to January 2011. Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent
crude futures increased $11.55 to $60.93 a ton, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The difference, also known as the
crack spread, rebounded from the narrowest since Nov. 29.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rebounded from the lowest level in almost five months
as the metal’s slump, driven by concerns about  Greece ’s possible
exit from the euro and a stronger dollar, encouraged buying from
investors. Silver and platinum advanced.  Spot gold rose for the first time in five days, gaining as
much as 0.9 percent to $1,553.93 an ounce and trading at
$1,547.18 at 3:12 p.m. in Singapore. The metal fell to $1,526.97
yesterday, the lowest price since Dec. 29 and down 21 percent
from an intraday record in September. Bullion’s so-called 14-day
relative-strength index was at 27.17, below the level of 30 that
may indicate a rebound.  Cash platinum, the only precious metal still higher this
year, gained for the first time in eight days, snapping the
longest slump in 11 months. It gained as much as 1.4 percent to
$1,452.38 an ounce before trading at $1,445.50 after tumbling to
$1,422.50 yesterday, the lowest level since Jan. 10.  BASE METALS  Copper rebounded from a four-month low as optimism that the
 Federal Reserve  may do more to stimulate the  U.S. economy  and
rising cash premiums in  Shanghai  spurred speculation that demand
will improve. Aluminum and zinc also advanced.  The metal for three-month delivery rose for the first time
in five days, gaining as much as 1.6 percent to $7,775.75 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, before trading at
$7,748.25 at 3 p.m. Shanghai time. The contract slid to $7,625
yesterday, the lowest since Jan. 10, with the relative strength
index falling to 29.86, below the 30 level that suggests an
oversold condition. The RSI was last below 30 in October.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat gained for a fourth-day, the longest winning streak
since January, on concern dry weather in the U.S.,  Australia  and
 Russia  may hurt yields in the world’s three biggest shippers
this year.  The July-delivery contract gained as much as 1.4 percent to
$6.4775 a bushel, extending yesterday’s 5 percent jump, the
biggest advance for the most-active contract since March 30. It
traded at $6.425, up 0.6 percent by 3:42 p.m. Singapore time.  Corn for July delivery was little changed at $6.195 a
bushel, after jumping 3.8 percent yesterday. Futures advanced
after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said that  China  bought
900,000 metric tons of the grain from U.S. exporters, including
660,000 tons previously reported as sold to unknown destination.  Soybeans for July delivery gained for a third day, rising
as much as 1 percent to $14.355 a bushel, before trading at
$14.325.  Rubber gained the most in four months after data showed
Japan’s economy expanded faster than estimated last quarter and
as oil snapped a four-day losing streak, raising the appeal of
the commodity used in tires.  October-delivery rubber advanced as much as 3.6 percent to
274.7 yen a kilogram ($3,420 a metric ton), the biggest gain for
a most-active contract since Jan. 17, before settling at 273.6
yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange.  Palm oil  rebounded from the biggest drop in more than 14
months as the slump, driven by concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis
will worsen with the possible exit of Greece from the euro
region, prompted buying from consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
