Hong Kong stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index reversing earlier gains, as concern that
Europe’s debt crisis was deepening offset optimism that the U.S.
Federal Reserve stood ready to add stimulus if needed.  HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank, declined 1
percent.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-
Mart Stores Inc. that gets 60 percent of sales in the U.S.,
advanced 1.8 percent.  Tianneng Power International Ltd. (819)  led
gains among battery makers as China said it will subsidize the
use of energy-saving household appliances, products and energy-
efficient vehicles.  The  Hang Seng Index (VHSI)  fell 0.3 percent to 19,200.93 at the
close of trading in Hong Kong, after earlier rising as much as
0.6 percent. The gauge yesterday entered a co-called correction
after falling more than 10 percent from its Feb. 29 high for the
year. Three stocks fell for every one that advanced amid volume
that was 7.2 percent above the 30-day intraday average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Equities generally will underperform as long as there is
no clarity on the fiscal or monetary input” in  Europe , said
Viktor Shvets, the head of thematic equity research at Credit
Suisse Group AG in Hong Kong. “Until we inject more liquidity
we’ll continue to stall.” He spoke in a Bloomberg Television
interview today.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  has fallen 11 percent from Feb. 29 amid
signs China’s economic growth was slowing and as political
turmoil in Europe renewed concern the debt crisis will worsen.  The decline trimmed  this year ’s gain for Hong Kong’s equity
benchmark index to 4.2 percent. Shares on the index traded at
9.9 times estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of 12.6
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 10.1 times for the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   China Shares  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland stocks
lost 0.4 percent to 9,700.87. The measure fell 12 percent this
month through yesterday, wiping out its gain for the year.  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.3 percent today. The index
slipped 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday, capping four days of
losses, the longest decline in a month.  Companies that do business in Europe slipped as Greece
heads toward national elections six weeks after the last vote,
with its international bailout at stake. The  European Central
Bank  said it will temporarily stop lending to some Greek banks
to limit its risk as President Mario Draghi signaled the ECB
won’t compromise on key principles to keep Greece in the euro.  HSBC declined 1 percent to HK$65.80.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) ,
the clothing retailer that gets 80 percent of sales from Europe,
lost 1.5 percent to HK$13.10, taking its retreat this week to 13
percent.  Fed Comments  U.S. economic data bolstered optimism that the world’s
largest economy can withstand fallout from Europe. Several
Federal Reserve policy makers said a loss of momentum in growth
or increased risks to their economic outlook could warrant
additional action to keep the recovery going, minutes of their
last meeting showed.  Li & Fung gained 1.8 percent to HK$14.44.  Techtronic
Industries Co. (669) , a power-tools maker that makes 72 percent of
sales in North America, rose 2.3 percent to HK$8.82.
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which makes 60
percent of revenue in  North America , gained 1.5 percent to 33.5
Hong Kong cents.  Battery makers gained as China said it will allocate 26.5
billion  yuan  ($4.2 billion) in subsidies to boost the use of
energy-saving household appliances and products, according to a
statement posted on the government website yesterday citing a
State Council meeting presided by Premier Wen Jiabao. Tianneng
Power International surged 4.5 percent to HK$3.96 and Chaowei
Power Holdings Ltd. rose 2.7 percent to HK$3.39.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index expiring this month slid 0.8
percent to 19,005. The HSI Volatility Index rose 0.2 percent to
27.79, indicating traders expect a swing of about 8 percent in
the benchmark index during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
