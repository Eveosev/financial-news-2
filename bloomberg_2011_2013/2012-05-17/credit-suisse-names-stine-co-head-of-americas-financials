Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) , the third-
biggest merger adviser this year, named Craig Stine co-head of
the investment-banking group for financial institutions in the
Americas.  Stine, 52, will work alongside Neil Carragher, Zurich-based
Credit Suisse wrote today in an internal memo. Its contents were
confirmed by Jack Grone, a company spokesman.  The financial-institutions group “continues to be a vital
part” of the investment-banking division, Alejandro Przygoda
and Ewen Stevenson, the group’s global heads, said in the memo.  Stine, whose clients have included  American Express Co. (AXP)  and
 Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , joined Credit Suisse last year
after leading Citadel LLC’s investment-banking effort.  Steven Pierson, the previous Americas co-head, will become
a vice chairman focusing on client relationships, according to
the memo.  Credit Suisse said yesterday that Boon Sim, the global head
of mergers and acquisitions, is leaving to join Temasek Holdings
Pte., Singapore’s state-owned investment company. He’ll be
replaced by Scott Lindsay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
