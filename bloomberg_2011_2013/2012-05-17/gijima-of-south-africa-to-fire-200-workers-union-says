Gijima Group Ltd. (GIJ) , a South African
computer-services company, plans to fire 200 workers by August

contract, the labor union Solidarity said.  “A number of Gijima employees received a letter yesterday,
informing them that a new retrenchment process was in the
offing,” the labor union said in an e-mailed statement today.  Gijima, based in Pretoria, can’t say how many workers will
may be affected is it’s still consulting employees, spokesman
Tshidi Ramoshaba in an e-mailed statement. It plans to cut
costs, which “will include reducing its human  capital costs  by
between 8 percent and 12 percent,” the company said in a
statement on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
