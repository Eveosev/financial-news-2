Maine  had the outlook on $498 million
in general-obligation bonds lowered to negative from stable by
Moody’s Investors Service on “challenges” related to Medicaid
spending and a lack of reserves.  The company also affirmed the rating of Aa2, third-highest,
on the debt and assigned the same to $55.8 million of general-
obligation bonds the state plans to issue, Moody’s said today in
a statement. Maine plans to issue the debt on May 31 for capital
projects, Moody’s said.  Maine’s revenue performance is “tracking slightly over
budget,” the company said, while the state’s unemployment rate
of 7.2 percent is below the nation’s 8.1 percent.  The rating reflects the state’s “manageable debt levels;
improving revenue performance; the resolution of recent budget
shortfalls with largely recurring actions; and pension reforms
that have improved the state’s funded ratios and lowered the
annual required contribution,” Moody’s said. “Debt ratios are
below the 50-state medians and debt is scheduled for rapid
retirement within 10 years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
