Sterling Biotech Ltd. (SLT) , a gelatin
maker based in Mumbai, didn’t pay $184 million of convertible
notes that matured yesterday, the biggest missed payment by an
Indian company on debt that can be swapped for shares.  The company is negotiating a new repayment schedule with
investors, according to a person familiar with the matter, who
confirmed the non-payment and asked not to be identified because
the details are private. Sterling has hired  Avista Advisory
Associates Pvt.  and  Houlihan Lokey , a U.S. investment bank, to
advise on the restructuring, the person said.  Sterling is the third Indian company to miss a convertible
bond repayment this year, after Hotel Leela Venture Ltd. and
Murli Industries Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Companies in the South Asian nation need to repay a record $5.3
billion of convertible securities in 2012, the data show.  Sterling Chairman Nitin Sandesara wasn’t available to
comment when called at his office in Mumbai today. Convertible
bonds can be exchanged for a set number of shares in the company
that issued the notes at a pre-determined conversion price.  Sterling dropped as much as 1.2 percent to 7.95 rupees in
Mumbai today, the lowest in almost a decade. The stock has
plunged 62 percent this year and is trading at 95 percent below
the rate at which investors can convert their debt into shares.  The zero-coupon bonds, sold in 2007 at par, were due to be
redeemed at $136.7 per $100 of face value, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The notes traded at $44 on May 15,
according to Cantor Fitzgerald LP prices. Sterling also has 3
billion rupees ($55 million) of 12 percent bonds due in August
2015, the data show.  The company reported a second straight quarter of losses
for the three months ended March 31 on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
