Spain  sold the maximum target of 2.5
billion euros ($3.2 billion) of bonds at an auction even as the
Treasury paid the most this year to sell three-year debt amid
growing concern that contagion from a Greek exit from the euro
area may engulf Spain.  Spain sold bonds due in January 2015 at an average yield of
4.375 percent, compared with 2.89 percent when they were sold in
April. It sold bonds due in July 2015 at 4.876 percent, compared
with 4.037 percent on May 3 and bonds due in April 2016 at 5.106
percent.  Demand was 4.47 times the amount sold for the January 2015
debt, compared with 2.41 at the last auction, and the bid-to-
cover for the July 2015 securities was 3.01, compared with 2.88.  The Treasury aimed to sell 1.5 billion euros to 2.5 billion
euros of bonds, about half the level at similar auctions a year
ago. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said yesterday the country
faces the “serious risk” of losing access to debt markets.
Spanish 10-year bond yields rose as high as 6.5 percent
yesterday, approaching the 7 percent mark that pushed  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal  toward European rescue packages.  The yield fell to 6.31 percent after the auction from as
high as 6.36 percent before the sale, narrowing the spread over
German bunds to 484 basis points.  The Treasury is trying to lure investors back into Spanish
debt. Foreign investors cut their holdings to 219.6 billion
euros as of the end of March, or 37.5 percent of the total,
compared with 281.4 billion euros, or 50 percent, at the end of
last year, data from the Treasury show. Spanish banks increased
their holdings to 170.6 billion euros from 94.4 billion euros
after the ECB offered banks unlimited funds for three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
