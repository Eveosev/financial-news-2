Russia-focused equity funds may post
this year’s biggest outflows in the week ended May 16, with
redemptions of $300 million, according to UralSib Capital.  “ Russia  is not seen as a positive market right now,”
Leonid Slipchenko, an analyst at UralSib in Moscow, said by
phone. “The oil price is under pressure. For the Russian market
that’s very important. Greek weakness has been dragging on.”  Fund outflows for Russia were $188 million in the week
ended May 9, the biggest so far this year, according to EPFR
Global data.  Greece  faces a fresh election on June 17 that may
boost parties opposed to international bailout conditions,
increasing the risk of its exit from the common currency. Oil,
Russia’s biggest export earner, lost 4 percent in the week ended
May 16 in  New York  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
