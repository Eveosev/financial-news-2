Thailand ’s baht rebounded from its
weakest level since January on speculation exporters will
convert earnings at a more-favorable exchange rate. Government
bonds rose for a second day.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index snapped a four-day
drop as the  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia-Pacific Index of shares climbed. Overseas
sales increased 7.4 percent in April from a year earlier after
falling 6.5 percent in March, according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg survey before a government report
next week.  “We can expect exporters will continue to buy the baht at
a better level,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange
trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “The baht is getting some upward
momentum from other Asian currencies and gains in regional
stocks are also good for sentiment.”  The baht climbed 0.4 percent, the most since April 27, to
31.37 per dollar as of 8:36 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 31.57 yesterday, the
weakest level since Jan. 26.  One-month implied volatility, which measures  exchange-rate 
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 declined
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.55 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Thailand sold 16 billion baht ($510 million) of notes due
June 2017 yesterday, drawing bids for 4.68 times the amount of
debt on offer, according to official data. The bid-cover ratio
was 2.78 times in the previous auction of five-year bonds on
March 28.  Demand may stay “strong” amid growing risk aversion,
Rohit Arora, a strategist at  Barclays Capital  in  Singapore ,
wrote in a note to clients yesterday. “We still see value in
five- to 10-year Thai  government bonds  and target the five-year
yields to drop towards 3.4 percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
