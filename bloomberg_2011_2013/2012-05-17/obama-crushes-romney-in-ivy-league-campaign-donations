President  Barack Obama  has received
$17,869 in donations for his re-election efforts from 18 members
of Brown University’s faculty, including Ruth Simmons, who is
stepping down as president of the Ivy League school in
Providence, Rhode Island.  Mitt Romney has just James Fingleton to thank for his $500
donation.  “I am a microscopic minority,” said Fingleton, an
assistant professor of surgery at Brown’s medical school. “The
vast majority of people who work in medicine at Brown, and at
Brown University as a whole, they tend to be pretty liberal.”  Obama’s 35:1 fundraising edge at Brown illustrates his lead
over Romney in collecting donations for the 2012 campaign from
the faculty and staff at America’s most prestigious colleges.
Professors, administrators and others employed at the eight
universities of the Ivy League have given $375,932 to Obama and
$60,465 to Romney, according to data compiled by the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington watchdog group that tracks
campaign finance issues.  “I don’t feel like a pariah,” Fingleton said. “I kind of
carry the banner pretty proudly.” He said he would describe
himself as “a fiscal conservative and a social moderate, and I
can’t agree with the direction that Obama is taking the
country.”  Harvard’s Preference  As Wall Street money shifts from Democrats to Republicans
in this presidential campaign, Obama appears to have tenure with
the professors and administrators who are educating America’s
elite. At  Harvard University  in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where
both Obama and Romney received law degrees and Romney also got a
master’s degree in business, faculty members have given $131,654
to the president and $31,600 to Romney.  The one branch of Ivy academia where Romney has a slight
advantage: Harvard Business School, whose employees have donated
$14,000 to Romney and $11,400 to Obama.  Four years ago, Obama’s Harvard boosters were even more
enthusiastic, with professors at the university donating
$573,168 to Obama and $17,046 to his Republican challenger,
 Arizona  Senator John McCain.  Obama has made light of his Harvard pedigree and needled
Romney for his two degrees. “What a snob,” Obama joked at the
White House Correspondents Dinner on April 28 about Romney’s
degrees from Harvard Law and Harvard Business.  Columbia, Dartmouth  At  Columbia University  in  New York  City, where Obama earned
his undergraduate degree, faculty members have given $74,017 to
the president. Romney has received $17,500, about one-quarter as
much.  At Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, the site of
last October’s Bloomberg-Washington Post Republican debate, the
former Massachusetts governor’s fundraising performance --$1,000
-- doubles his contributions from Brown. Obama, by contrast, has
collected $17,075 from school employees.  Romney’s highest dollar yield is at  Cornell University , in
Ithaca, New York. Still, his $6,000 in contributions is only
about one-quarter of Obama’s $22,869 haul.  At 41:1, Obama’s best donation ratio comes from  Yale
University  in  New Haven ,  Connecticut . Obama has collected
$45,851 from Yale faculty, while Romney has raised $1,115.  The president’s academic advantage extends behind the
Northeast’s ivied walls and into the Midwest.  At  Ohio State University  in Columbus, for example, Obama
has raised $18,230 from faculty and staff, compared with
Romney’s $3,500.  To contact the reporter on this story:
