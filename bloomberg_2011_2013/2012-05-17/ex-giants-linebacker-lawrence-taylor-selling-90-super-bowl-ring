New York Giants Hall of Fame
linebacker Lawrence Taylor is selling the  Super Bowl 
championship ring he won following the 1990 National Football
League season.  The ring features 19 diamonds and is estimated to be worth
as much as $100,000, according an e-mailed release from  SCP
Auctions , which is handling the online sale. The auction opened
with a minimum price of $10,000 and has risen to $37,982 after
12 bids.  A note on the  auction website  says the ring’s reserve price
hasn’t yet been met. Bidding ends at 10 p.m. May 19.  Neither the auction website nor the release makes any
mention about Taylor’s motives for selling. Mike Senyo, a
spokesman for SCP Auctions, said in an e-mail that the
linebacker is “just ready to sell.”  Taylor, 53, was selected to 10 Pro Bowls in a 13-year
career spent entirely in  New York . He was the NFL’s Most
Valuable Player in 1986, a three-time defensive player of the
year and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in
1999.  The Giants beat the  Buffalo Bills  20-19 in the Super Bowl
on Jan. 27, 1991, as Bills kicker Scott Norwood missed a field
goal in the closing seconds.  The championship is one of four that the Giants have won
since the Super Bowl was first played in 1967. Members of the
2011 team, which beat the  New England Patriots  in the Super Bowl
in February, received their rings yesterday at the Tiffany & Co.
building in  Manhattan .  Off Field  Taylor has a history of run-ins with the police since
retiring after the 1993 season. Last year, he pleaded guilty to
two misdemeanor charges of having sex with a prostitute. The
plea stemmed from a 2010 arrest for having sex with a 16-year-
old girl, and Taylor is now a registered sex offender.  An admitted cocaine user, Taylor underwent rehabilitation
for abuse of the drug in 1985 and three years later was
suspended by the NFL for 30 days after a second positive test
for the substance.  In 1995, Taylor spent time in drug-rehabilitation
facilities.  Taylor pleaded guilty to  tax evasion  in 2000 and received a
$10,000 fine and five years probation. In November 2009, he was
arrested in Hialeah,  Florida , after crashing into another  motor
vehicle  and leaving the scene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
