Pretoria Portland Cement Co. (PPC) ,
 Africa ’s biggest cement maker is seeing “significant progress”
on some African projects, with demand in southern Africa
continuing to improve.  PPC may announce two projects on the continent in the next
few months, Chief Executive Officer Paul Stuiver said by phone
from Johannesburg today. The company’s expansion in Africa may
include Ethiopia,  Democratic Republic  of Congo and Mozambique,
and the plan to increase revenue from operations on the
continent outside  South Africa  to 50 percent from 20 percent is
on schedule, he said.  PPC’s Zimbabwe business, which accounts for about 10
percent of production, is seeing “very high demand” and the
unit is expected to make an improved contribution to second-half
earnings, Stuiver said.  Net income climbed 8 percent from a year earlier to 369
million rand ($45 million) in the six months through March, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. Sales rose
8 percent to 3.52 billion rand, while earnings per share
increased 8 percent to 76.7 cents.  Profit growth was hampered by “fierce competition” on
cement prices and increased power costs, the company said. PPC’s
cement sales in Botswana declined, mainly because of a cut in
 government spending  on infrastructure projects, and also because
of a civil service strike and increased competition.  PPC shares rose 0.2 percent to 29.06 rand at the close in
Johannesburg, bringing the advance this year to 6.1 percent and
giving the company a market value of 17 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
