Mortgage rates  in the U.S. fell to a
record for a third straight week, reducing borrowing costs as
the housing market improves and home-loan defaults decline.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan dropped to 3.79
percent in the week ended today from 3.83 percent,  Freddie Mac 
said in a statement. It was the lowest in the McLean, Virginia-
based mortgage-finance company’s data dating to 1971. The
average 15-year rate decreased to 3.04 percent, also a record,
from 3.05 percent.  Record-low mortgage rates, combined with  job  gains and
lower-priced homes, are helping to lift housing demand and
stabilize the real estate market. Housing affordability reached
a new high in the first quarter and sales of previously owned
homes rose 5.3 percent from a year earlier, data from the
National Association of Realtors show. The share of home loans
at least 30 days  late  dropped to 7.4 percent, the lowest since
2008, the  Mortgage Bankers Association  said yesterday.  Low borrowing costs are encouraging homeowners to reduce
their monthly bills. The mortgage bankers’ measure of
 refinancing  applications jumped 13 percent in the week ended May
11, the mortgage-banking group said yesterday. The gauge of
 purchases  declined 2.4 percent.  Builders began work on more homes than analysts estimated
in April, a sign the real estate market is stabilizing. Housing
 starts  climbed 2.6 percent from the previous month to an annual
pace of 717,000, Commerce Department data showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
