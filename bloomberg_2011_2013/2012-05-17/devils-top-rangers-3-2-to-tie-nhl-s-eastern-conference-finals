David Clarkson scored early in the
third period to give the New Jersey Devils a 3-2 victory against
the  New York Rangers .  “We’ve been playing some good hockey and we’ve got to
continue to do it,” Clarkson told reporters. “That is a big
win for us.”  Last night’s result at Madison Square Garden in New York
leaves the best-of-seven National Hockey League playoff series
tied at one game apiece. Game 3 in the Eastern Conference finals
is in two days at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.  “We have to take care of business at home,” Devils coach
Pete DeBoer told reporters. “There’s a lot of hockey left and
I’m glad to be going home.  Ilya Kovalchuk had his sixth goal of the playoffs in the
first period and Ryan Carter also scored for the Devils.  Marc Staal  and rookie Chris Kreider scored for the Rangers.  New York ’s second goal, on a power play by Kreider midway
through the second period, followed an eight-minute interruption
when the penalty box door got stuck, preventing the Devils’
Travis Zajac getting in.  The series winner will play the  Los Angeles Kings  or the
Phoenix Coyotes for the  Stanley Cup . The Kings lead the Western
Conference finals two games to none, with Game 3 scheduled
tonight in Los Angeles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
