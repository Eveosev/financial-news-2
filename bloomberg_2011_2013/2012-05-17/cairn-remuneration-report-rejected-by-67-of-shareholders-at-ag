Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , the  oil company 
that spent about $1 billion exploring off  Greenland  without a
find, had its remuneration report voted down by shareholders.  The resolution was rejected by 67 percent of those who
voted at today’s annual general meeting, Cairn said in a stock
exchange filing. The company in January canceled plans to award
more than 2.5 million pounds ($4 million) in shares to former
Chief Executive Officer Bill Gammell, who today was opposed by
11 percent of shareholders for re-election as chairman.  “The board and I fully acknowledge the strength of the
views expressed by our shareholders in some of their voting
today,” Gammell said in a statement. “Cairn endeavors to meet
the highest corporate governance standards and is conscious of
its responsibility to ensure best practice and continue an open
dialogue with its shareholders at all times.”  The company, based in Edinburgh, returned $3.5 billion to
shareholders after selling most of its Indian unit last year for
$8.7 billion to  Vedanta Resources Plc. (VED)  After focusing for two
years on Greenland, Cairn this month completed the acquisition
of Agora Oil & Gas AS, a North Sea explorer.  Cairn has declined 15 percent since the proceeds from the
disposal of its Indian unit were distributed in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
