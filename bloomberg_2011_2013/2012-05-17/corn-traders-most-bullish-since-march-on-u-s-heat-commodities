Corn traders are the most bullish
since March on mounting concern that hot and dry weather will
curb U.S. yields at a time of accelerating demand from  China ,
the second largest buyer of U.S. farm goods.  Nineteen of 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices
to gain next week and three were neutral, the highest proportion
since March 30. Iowa, Illinois and  Indiana , which produce 40
percent of the U.S. crop, are poised for a seventh consecutive
month of above-normal temperatures, the most since 1895, T-Storm
Weather LLC said yesterday. U.S. export sales of corn surged 83
percent in the week ended May 10, from a week earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  Corn jumped 9.1 percent since May 11, heading for the best
week in almost a year and rebounding from a slump caused by the
USDA predicting a record crop the day before.  Hedge funds  and
other speculators have raised bets on higher prices for two
consecutive weeks, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. Parts of the Midwest got 25 percent of normal  rain 
in the past two weeks, National Weather Service data show.  “People are starting to get worried about new crop
yields,” said Nick Higgins, an analyst at Rabobank
International in London. “We won’t really have a good idea
until we see the late June and early July temperatures, because
that’s when the majority of yields are really decided.”  Corn fell 2 percent to $6.3375 a bushel on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade this year as the USDA forecast a record U.S.
harvest of 14.79 billion bushels (376 million metric tons). The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities fell 2.1 percent
and the MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWD)  of equities is little
changed. Treasuries returned 1.4 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows.  Chinese Imports  China  imported  2.9 million tons of grain from the U.S.
since the marketing year began Sept. 1, about nine times more
than a year earlier, USDA data show. U.S. corn export sales
totaled 865,097 metric tons the week ended May 10, compared with
473,411 a week earlier. The USDA announced April 27 that unknown
buyers bought 1.44 million tons of corn, the biggest one-day
sale since 1994. China bought $18.85 billion of U.S. farm
products in 2011, second to  Canada , USDA data show.  September futures on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  in China
closed May 16 at the equivalent of $9.58 a bushel, up 4.9
percent this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China’s cost
of importing U.S. corn on May 14 fell to the lowest in two
weeks, according to Shanghai JC Intelligence Co., using a
formula that includes the price of grain, shipping, import
tariffs and other taxes.  National Grain  Rising demand is spurring growers globally to boost output.
The USDA estimates world production at 945.78 million tons, the
highest ever and 8.7 percent more than a year earlier. China,
the biggest producer after the U.S., may harvest a record 197.5
million tons, the China National Grain & Oils Information Center
said May 16.  Prospects for the U.S. crop would rebound if the weather
improves, Macquarie Group Ltd.’s commodity analysts said
yesterday in a report. Farmers typically start harvesting in
September. An outlook for rising  supplies  from the Northern
Hemisphere spurred the bank to cut its forecasts to an average
of $5.865 for 2012 and $4.65 in 2013. The grain averaged $6.33
so far this year.  Deere Outlook  Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest maker of agricultural
equipment, said in its earnings report on May 16 that prices
will average $4.85 in the year beginning Sept. 1. The Moline,
Illinois-based company had forecast $5.30 in February.  “A year from now certainly I would expect inventories to
be much higher than what we’re sitting on now,” said Chris
Narayanan, the head of agricultural commodities research at
Societe Generale SA in  New York . The USDA is anticipating a 19
percent jump in global stockpiles by the end of the next season.  The anticipated gain in inventories may be constrained by
expanding demand. U.S. production of ethanol, derived from corn,
climbed to 904,000 barrels a day last week, the most in more
than two months, Energy Department data show. The USDA estimates
that about 5 billion bushels of the U.S. crop will be used to
make the fuel in 2012-13, close to the record 5.02 billion of
the 2010-11 season.  U.S. farmers will feed livestock 5.45 billion bushels of
corn, 20 percent more than a year earlier, the USDA estimates.
China’s  hog herd , the world’s biggest, was 5.5 percent larger in
April than a year earlier, the government said May 16.  In other commodities, 13 of 26 traders and analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expect copper to fall next week and five
were neutral, marking the most bearish outlook since November.  Metal Exchange  The metal for delivery in three months, the  London  Metal
Exchange’s benchmark, fell to a four-month low of $7,625 a ton
on May 16 on speculation demand will deteriorate as growth slows
in China and concern mounts that  Greece  will exit the 17-nation
euro region. China accounts for 41 percent of global consumption
and  Europe  18 percent, Barclays Plc estimates.  Gold analysts were bearish for the first time in six weeks,
with 13 of 29 people surveyed expecting prices to fall next
week. Five were neutral. The metal dropped to $1,526.70 an ounce
on May 16 on Comex in New York, the lowest since Dec. 29.
Investors are reducing gold holdings in exchange-traded products
for a third consecutive month, the longest stretch since 2004,
and favoring the dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Raw Sugar  Five of 11 people surveyed said raw sugar will decline next
week and one was neutral. The commodity dropped 12 percent to
20.49 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York this year.
Sixteen of 28 people surveyed anticipate higher soybean prices
next week. The oilseed gained 18 percent this year on the CBOT
to $14.21 a bushel.  Investors took $1 billion out of commodities last month,
with overall assets under management declining to $429 billion
from $435 billion in March as prices dropped, Barclays said in a
report yesterday.  “A lot of commodities have been sold off on concern about
Europe and now increasingly more on China,” said Carole
Ferguson, an analyst at Fairfax IS Ltd. in London. “When the
dust settles, which I think will happen this year, interest in
commodities will return.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
