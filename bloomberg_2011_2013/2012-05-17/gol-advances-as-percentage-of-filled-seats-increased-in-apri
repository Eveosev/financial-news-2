Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
 Brazil ’s second-biggest airline, rose after it said the average
percentage of seats filled by fare-paying customers increased
last month.  Shares rose 1.2 percent to 9.59 reais at 2:21 p.m. in Sao
Paulo after earlier increasing 4.2 percent, the steepest
intraday gain in almost two weeks. The benchmark Bovespa index
dropped 1.3 percent.  Gol’s overall load factor climbed to 71.1 percent in April
from 64.3 percent in March, according to a company press release
today. The increase came as the carrier is retrenching as it
tries to return to profitability amid higher labor costs.  “This shows the strategy of cutting not so profitable
flights and improving management of ticket pricing is working,
so results can be positive again,” Leonardo Ribeiro Nitta, an
analyst at Banco do Brasil, said by phone from  Sao Paulo .  Gol, based in Sao Paulo, posted this month a 41.4 million
reais ($20.7 million) consolidated net loss in the first
quarter, compared with net income of 69.4 million reais a year
earlier.  The company dismissed 131 crew members and cut 80 of its
900 daily flights and is on schedule to spin off its frequent-
flier business, known as Smiles, executives said on a conference
call on May 4. Total dismissal this year will reach 1,200 by the
end of June, newspaper  Valor Economico  reported today.  Rival  Tam SA (TAM)  lost 3.1 percent to 42.22 reais today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
