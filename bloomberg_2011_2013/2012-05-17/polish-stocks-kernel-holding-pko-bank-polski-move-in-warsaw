Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  fell 3 percent
to 2,057.12 at the close in Warsaw, its biggest decline in more
than six months.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Kernel Holding SA (KER)  , Ukraine’s biggest sunflower-oil
producer, slumped 7.8 percent to 55.35 zloty, the biggest drop
since November 2009. The company cut its profit outlook for the
2012 fiscal year to $215 million from $255 million on May 15.  “The stock can now underperform the market as the
execution of the lowered forecast is still a challenge,” Jakub Szkopek, a Warsaw-based analyst at DI BRE Bank SA, said by phone
today.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO)  , the country’s largest lender,
slumped 3.3 percent to 30.67 zloty, the lowest level in more
than four months, as the European Central Bank paused lending to
some Greek banks and speculation mounted that Spanish banks may
have their credit ratings cut at Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
