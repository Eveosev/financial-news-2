A Greek exit from the euro area
wouldn’t have the same impact on financial markets as the
collapse of  Lehman Brothers  Holdings Inc. in 2008, Estonian
Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said.  “Lehman was something where everything fell apart, there
was real panic,” Ligi told reporters in the Estonian capital
Tallinn today. “We’ve been getting used to the idea” of a
Greek exit “for a while,” he said. “There has been a massive
writedown of Greek debt from balance sheets. Firewalls have been
built.”  European stocks dropped for a fourth day after the  European
Central Bank  said it will temporarily stop lending to some Greek
banks to limit its risk as President  Mario Draghi  signaled the
ECB won’t compromise on key principles to keep Greece in the
euro area.  Greece abandoning the euro “isn’t a scenario that European
finance ministers would discuss or would want to be discussed,”
Ligi said, adding that the consequences of a Greek exit “aren’t
known.” European governments need to agree on “clear messages”
for  Greece  to avoid another inconclusive election on June 17, he
said.  Estonia, together with Baltic neighbors Latvia and
 Lithuania , suffered most in the 27-member EU as the collapse of
Lehman Brothers triggered the end of a debt-fueled property
bubble, shut off inflows of credit and closed export markets,
slashing economic output by a fifth in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
