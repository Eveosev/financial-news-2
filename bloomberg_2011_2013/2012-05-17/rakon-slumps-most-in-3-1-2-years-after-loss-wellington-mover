Rakon Ltd. (RAK) , a maker of crystal
oscillators for global positioning systems, fell the most in 3
1/2 years in Wellington after reporting a full-year loss as New
Zealand currency gains curbed revenue.  The loss was NZ$420,000 ($321,600) in the year ended March
31 compare with a NZ$8.5 million profit a year ago, the
Auckland-based company said in a statement. The shares declined
as much as 15 percent, headed for their biggest tumble since Nov.
14, 2008.  Rakon products are used in smartphones, cameras, military
equipment and telecommunications networks globally. Revenue and
earnings from exports and its overseas manufacturing sites have
been curbed by a slower world economy and the New Zealand
dollar’s 7.5 percent gain in the year through March, it said.  “When you are involved in high growth markets, there is
always going to be some variability,” Chief Executive Officer
Brent Robinson said in the statement. “We have never felt
better about the business’s overall position, the market
opportunity and our customers.”  The  stock  fell 9.3 percent to 49 cents as at 12:05 p.m. in
Wellington, after earlier trading as low as 46 cents.  Full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization dropped to NZ$13.1 million from NZ$24.8 million a
year earlier, the company said. In August, the company forecast
earnings of NZ$14 million to NZ$18 million.  Assuming a constant currency, earnings would have fallen by
about NZ$2.5 million, it said.  Full-year revenue fell 6 percent after conversion to New
Zealand dollars. Revenue in U.S. dollars rose 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
