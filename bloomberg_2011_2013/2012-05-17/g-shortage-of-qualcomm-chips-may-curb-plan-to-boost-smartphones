LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the second-
largest handset maker in  South Korea , said a shortage of
 Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) ’s mobile-phone chips may impede plans to raise
production and sales of smartphones this year.  “It’s one of the issues that is giving us headaches,”
Park Jong Seok, head of the  mobile-phone business , said at a
press briefing in Seoul after unveiling a new Optimus phone
using a Qualcomm chip today. “They aren’t able to give us what
we are asking them for.”  Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for phones, said last
month it can’t get enough supply of the latest so-called
baseband chips. The  San Diego , California-based company is the
main provider of chips that offer faster connections to the
Internet from mobile devices that use the Long Term Evolution,
or LTE, technology. Phone makers such as LG are adopting the
technology to lure consumers demanding higher speed.  LG, which was overtaken by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  as the No. 3 mobile-
phone maker in the world last year, is introducing more Optimus
devices using the LTE technology to regain market share. The
models helped Seoul-based LG post a 39 billion won operating
profit ($34 million) from selling phones in the first quarter,
turning around from a 101 billion won loss a year ago.  The  company  said in February it seeks to sell 30 million to
35 million smartphones this year globally. LG is keeping the
target for now, Park said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
