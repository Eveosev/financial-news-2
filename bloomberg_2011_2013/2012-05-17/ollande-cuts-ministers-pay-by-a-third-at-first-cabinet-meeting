French President  Francois Hollande 
cut his government pay’s by almost a third at his first cabinet
meeting, fulfilling an election promise.  French ministers will now be paid 9,940 euros ($12,628) a
month instead of the 14,200 euros that former president  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s ministers earned. The salary of the president and
prime minister will be 14,910 euros, down from 21,300 euros.  The pay cut will take effect immediately even though it
won’t be approved by lawmakers until next month at the earliest.
Sarkozy aligned his own pay with the prime minister’s when he
took office five years ago, generating a 30 percent pay increase
that drew criticism and was cited among the decisions that cost
him a second term.  “Exemplarity and efficiency are the guiding principles of
this government,” Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, women’s minister and
government spokeswoman, said after the meeting today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
