The British government set up U.K.
Green Investment Bank Plc as part of plans for a 3 billion-pound
($4.7 billion) lender for investments in low-carbon power.  Green Investment Bank, to become operational this year,
will “shortly” appoint senior officials, a spokesman for the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said today. The
plan is subject to European Commission approval for state aid.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
