Hungary ’s government debt, the
highest among the European Union’s eastern members, fell in the
first quarter as the forint strengthened.  Debt dropped to 78.9 percent of gross domestic product at
end-March from 80.6 percent at end-2011, the central bank said
today in a quarterly report  published  on its website. Forint
gains cut debt by 526 billion forint ($2.2 billion), it said.  After falling 16 percent in the second half of last year,
Hungary’s currency rose 7 percent against the euro in the first
three months of 2012 as investors bet the government will agree
on an International Monetary Fund bailout to allay investor
concern over economic policy and the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
