Zambia may import refined petroleum
products from neighboring Angola when a new Angolan refinery is
completed, the  Daily Mail  said, citing Angolaâ€™s secretary for
foreign affairs, Manuel Augusto.  Angola plans to build a pipeline from the port town of
Lobito to Zambia to pump oil, the Lusaka-based  Daily Mail  said
on its website. Zambia, which is landlocked, currently imports
oil from the Middle East, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
