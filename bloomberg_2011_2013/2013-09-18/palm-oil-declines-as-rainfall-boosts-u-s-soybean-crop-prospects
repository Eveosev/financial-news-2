Palm oil dropped for the first time
in four days on speculation that rain in the U.S. Midwest
will halt deteriorating conditions of the soybean crop, boosting
supplies of the oilseed crushed to make a substitute oil.  The contract for delivery in December declined as much as
1.1 percent to 2,329 ringgit ($719) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, and was at 2,336 ringgit at 11:30 a.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . Palm oil for physical delivery in October was at
2,370 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Soybeans are headed for the first weekly decline in seven
as rains over the main growing regions in the U.S. are seen
beneficial for the crops. Precipitation may be highest over the
eastern Midwest, and the east and south portion of the western
Midwest, while a lack of cold weather will help crops mature,
forecaster DTN said in a report yesterday.  “Because of the rain in recent days, there is speculation
that this could result in a healthier crop than what was earlier
expected,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance Investment
Bank Bhd. “Ample supplies of soybeans could mean that there
could be less demand for  palm oil .”  Soybeans for November were little changed at $13.4075 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures are down 2.8
percent this week after rallying 17 percent in the six weeks
ended Sept. 13.  Soybean oil  for December delivery fell for a
fourth day, retreating 0.4 percent to 42.06 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery lost 0.2 percent to
5,400  yuan  ($882) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell 0.3 percent to
7,082 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
