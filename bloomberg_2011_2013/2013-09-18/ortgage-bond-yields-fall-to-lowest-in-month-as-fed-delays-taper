Yields on  Fannie Mae  and Freddie
Mac mortgage securities that guide U.S. home-loan rates dropped
to the lowest level in more than a month as the  Federal Reserve 
refrained from slowing its bond purchases.  A Bloomberg  index  of Fannie Mae’s current-coupon 30-year
securities dropped about 0.13 percentage point to 3.46 percent
at 2:17 p.m. in  New York , the lowest since Aug. 8. The yields,
which reached 3.81 percent on Sept. 5, have jumped from as low
as 2.28 percent in May as speculation grew that the Fed would
pare monthly debt purchases that include $40 billion of
government-backed mortgages securities.  “The Committee decided to await more evidence that
progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its
purchases,” the  Federal Open Market Committee  said today at the
conclusion of a two-day meeting in  Washington . While “downside
risks” to the outlook have diminished, “the tightening of
financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained,
could slow the pace of improvement.”  A measure of relative yields on the Fannie Mae current
coupon debt, or bonds trading closet to face value, declined to
about the lowest since June 19. Yields on the securities fell
about 0.02 percentage point to 1.34 percentage point higher than
an average of five- and 10-year Treasury rates, down from as
high as 1.51 percentage point in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
