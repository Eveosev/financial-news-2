United Arab Emirates’ lenders will
boost retail banking revenue at “high single to early double
digit” rates as  consumer lending  increases amid the region’s
accelerating economic growth, the country’s biggest bank said.  Retail banking, which includes products like credit cards
and personal loans, will likely account for 50 percent of
revenue at most banks over the next three years, up from about
35 percent now, Suvo Sarkar, the head of retail banking at
Dubai-based  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , said in an interview yesterday.  Dubai’s economy, the second-biggest of seven that make up
the U.A.E., is recovering from one of the world’s worst property
crashes, helped by a rebound in tourism and retail trade. The
country, with a population of 8.3 million, is home to 51 banks
including  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)   “The penetration of wealth management among customers is
quite low and even today, less than 20 percent of the spending
here is done on cards,” Sarkar said.  Emirates NBD’s revenue from consumer banking and wealth
management grew 13 percent in the first half to 1.24 billion
dirhams as lending advanced 12 percent in the six months through
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
