The euro may be poised to decline
versus the dollar as an indicator of turning points from Tom DeMark’s Market Studies LLC signals weakness, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG.  The euro is forming a top above its August peak of $1.3452
after completing a daily DeMark Sequential pattern, according to
Christopher Hine, a director of technical analysis at Credit
Suisse in  New York . The 17-nation currency will initially test
support at the $1.3221-to-$1.3226 range, according to Hine. If
the $1.3223 level is removed, the euro will test the pair’s 200-day moving average at $1.3158, he said.  Europe ’s shared currency may also face downward pressure as
the  Federal Reserve  is expected to trim monthly asset purchases
today from $85 billion to $80 billion, according to economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg. Slowed economic stimulus is likely to be
dollar-positive, which would weigh on the euro, according to
Hine.  “The top of our current range has been around $1.3452,”
Hine said in a telephone interview. “Our view going into the
Fed this afternoon is that we’ll fade up against that for a
retracement back down.”  The euro depreciated 0.1 percent to $1.3348 in New York.
The shared currency fell to a two and a half-week low on Sept.
6, touching $1.3105.  DeMark’s Sequential indicator is designed to predict
potential price “exhaustion” and likely reversals. It becomes
progressively less bearish as a price declines and, conversely,
less bullish as a price advances. DeMark, the creator of the
indicator, correctly called the stock market’s low in 2011.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
