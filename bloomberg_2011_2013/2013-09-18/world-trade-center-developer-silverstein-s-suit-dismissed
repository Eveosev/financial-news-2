Real estate developer Larry Silverstein can’t recoup any of the $1.2 billion recovered by
World Trade Center insurers in settlements with airlines and
airport security companies over the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attack that destroyed the office complex, a judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in  Manhattan  today
dismissed a suit by several companies associated with
Silverstein against QBE Insurance (Europe) Ltd., Industrial Risk
Insurers and three Lloyds of London syndicates.  Hellerstein ruled that the $4 billion Silverstein received
in a 2007 settlement with World Trade Center insurers fully
compensated him for any damages he could have claimed against
the aviation defendants, including  United Continental Holdings
Inc. (UAL)  and  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American Airlines.  After paying Silverstein, a group of World Trade Center
insurers sued to recover the money from the aviation defendants,
settling for $1.2 billion.  Bud Perrone , a Silverstein spokesman at Rubenstein
Communications, declined to comment on the ruling.  The case is In Re September 11 Litigation, 21-mc-00101,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
