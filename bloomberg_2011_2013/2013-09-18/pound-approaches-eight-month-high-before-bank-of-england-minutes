The pound strengthened to an eight-month high against the dollar and euro as  Bank of England 
minutes showed officials saw no need for additional monetary
stimulus as the economy improves.  The U.K. currency advanced for a fourth day versus the
greenback as the minutes of the September meeting showed “no
member judged that further stimulus was appropriate at
present.” In August, some policy makers saw a “compelling”
case for a loosening of policy. U.K. government bonds fell, with
10-year yields approaching the highest level since July 2011.
The U.S. Federal Reserve ends a two-day meeting today amid
speculation it will slow asset purchases.  “There has been the knee-jerk reaction you would expect as
there is now less of a threat that stimulus would be
increased,” said Christin Tuxen, a senior analyst at  Danske
Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “People have been caught by surprise by
the strong data in the U.K. Unless the Fed does something very
significant, there may be a limited market reaction.”  The pound rose 0.4 percent to $1.5968 at 4:28 p.m. London
time after climbing to $1.5980, the highest since Jan. 18. The
U.K. currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 83.59 pence per euro
after reaching 83.53 pence, also the strongest since Jan. 18.  Sterling has risen 6.6 percent in the past six months, the
best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 0.3
percent and the euro advanced 3.7 percent.  Unanimous Vote  The minutes, published today in London, also showed the
Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0 to keep the  bond-purchase
program  at 375 billion pounds and  benchmark interest rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent.  The panel led by Governor  Mark Carney  introduced forward
guidance last month, pledging to keep interest rates low until
the  unemployment rate  falls to 7 percent. It was 7.7 percent in
the three months through July.  “There were increased signs that the recovery was taking
hold,” the Bank of England said. Recent data “presented an
upside risk to the growth profile” published in the central
bank’s August Inflation Report, the minutes showed.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt jumped seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3 percent after increasing
to 3.05 percent on Sept. 11, the  highest  since July 27, 2011.
The 2.25 percent bond due in September 2023 fell 0.54, or 5.40
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 93.595.  The five-year gilt yield climbed eight basis points to 1.80
percent, meaning the rate is 16 basis points higher than that of
similar-maturity Treasury notes.  ‘We Struggle’  “We struggle with why five-year gilts are yielding more
than five-year Treasuries,” Andrew Wickham, head of U.K. and
global fixed-income at Insight Investment Management Ltd. in
 London , which oversees $256 billion in assets, said yesterday in
an interview. “That doesn’t seem to represent where the
respective economies and central banks are right now.”  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction 4.75
billion pounds of five-year gilts tomorrow. The U.K. last sold
the securities on Aug. 6 at an  average yield  of 1.405 percent.  The  two-year yield  rose four basis points to 0.55 percent
after reaching 0.57 percent, the highest since June 24. The
implied yield on short-sterling contracts expiring in December
2014 climbed six basis points to 0.99 percent.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 4.6 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German securities dropped 2.4 percent and Treasuries declined
3.5 percent.  Fed Tapering  Analysts are divided on the amount by which the  Federal
Open Market Committee  will scale back monthly asset purchases.
Among 64 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News , 33 predict the
Fed will reduce buying of Treasuries by $5 billion or less, with
31 forecasting a cut of $10 billion or more.  Trading patterns suggest the pound’s advance may be about
to end, according to Commerzbank AG.  The U.K. currency rose this week to within 0.4 percent of
$1.6035, the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of its decline
to this year’s low in July from its high in January, according
to Commerzbank AG. Another measure of trading patterns,
stochastic oscillators, also signal the pound has risen too far,
too fast and may be overdue for a decline.  The pound fell to $1.4814 on July 9 from this year’s high
of $1.6381 on Jan. 2, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “There are enough warning signals to suggest that this is
the time to exit long-sterling positions,” said  Karen Jones , a
technical strategist at Commerzbank in London. A long position
is a bet an asset will rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
