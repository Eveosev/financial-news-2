West Texas Intermediate advanced
for the first time in four days ahead of a Federal Reserve
decision on bond purchases and U.S. government data forecast to
show crude inventories fell to the lowest in a year.  Futures gained as much as 1.1 percent. Crude  stockpiles 
dropped by 1.2 million barrels last week to 359 million, the
least since August 2012, a Bloomberg News survey showed before a
report today from the Energy Information Administration. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  wraps up a two-day policy meeting
at which it will probably decide to curb its $85 billion of
monthly bond purchases, according to the median response of 64
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Positioning for tonight’s Fed decision looks to be the
main reason” for oil’s move, said Michael Poulsen, an analyst
at Global Risk Management in Middlefart,  Denmark . “What will be
interesting is how the markets will interpret the action. Will a
taper mean the economy is back on track or will the focus be on
lower amounts of money being shipped into the market.”  WTI for October delivery rose as much as $1.15 to $106.57 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and traded for $105.81 at 1:28 p.m. London time. The contract
dropped to $105.42 yesterday, the lowest close since Aug. 22.
The volume of all futures traded was about 9 percent more than
the 100-day average.  Brent for November settlement slipped 16 cents to $108.03 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark crude was at a premium of as little as $2.70
a barrel to WTI, the narrowest gap since Aug. 13, amid the
revival of some supplies from Libya.  Libya Exports  Analysts are divided on the amount by which the Fed will
scale back its monthly asset purchases. Among 64 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg, 33 predict it will reduce its buying of
Treasuries by $5 billion or less, with 31 forecasting a cut of
$10 billion or more.  Libya , the holder of  Africa ’s largest oil reserves, is
seeking to boost output to 700,000 barrels a day this week from
as little as 200,000 barrels, according to state-owned National
Oil Corp. Libya lifted force majeure at its Zawiya and Mellitah
terminals yesterday amid “improving conditions,” NOC said on
its website. Production has resumed from the El Feel and Sharara
fields, which will add a combined 400,000 barrels a day, Nuri
Berruien, chairman of the company, said yesterday.  Premium Dissipating  “The Libyan premium is dissipating,” said Mark Keenan, a
director of commodities research and strategy at Societe
Generale SA in  Singapore . “Libya is likely to remain an issue.
Unless output is significantly restored by the beginning of
October, the beginning of the seasonal demand period, the Libyan
premium will return.”  Labor disputes at ports, storage facilities and oil fields
have crippled exports from Libya, a member of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. It pumped about 1.6 million
barrels a day a year ago, a Bloomberg survey of producers and
analysts shows.  Crude stockpiles in the U.S., the world’s biggest oil
consumer, decreased by 252,000 barrels in the week ended Sept.
13, according to data from the  American Petroleum Institute 
yesterday. The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical unit, is
scheduled to release its Weekly Petroleum Status Report at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington  today.  Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the largest U.S. oil-storage
hub and the delivery point for New York-traded crude futures,
fell by 889,000 barrels, the API report shows.  Gasoline inventories dropped by 641,000 barrels, the
industry group said. The EIA report will probably show an
increase of 500,000 barrels, the  median estimate  of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg showed. Distillate stockpiles, a category
that includes heating oil and diesel, fell by 167,000 barrels,
according to the API, and compares with a projected 500,000
barrel gain for the government data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
