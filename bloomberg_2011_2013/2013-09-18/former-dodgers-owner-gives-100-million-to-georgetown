Frank McCourt , the former owner of
the  Los Angeles Dodgers , gave  Georgetown University  $100
million, the largest gift in its history, to endow a new school
for public policy.  The institution, to be called the McCourt School of Public
Policy, will incorporate Georgetown’s existing graduate program
in policy studies and a new data institute, the university in
Washington said today in an e-mailed  statement .  McCourt, 60, is a 1975 graduate of Georgetown and real
estate developer. He owned the Dodgers baseball team from 2003
to 2012, when he sold it for $2.2 billion following almost a
year in bankruptcy. McCourt spent two years in a public legal
battle with his wife, Jamie, in divorce court over claims she
co-owned the Dodgers. She received a $131 million settlement in
2011. Frank McCourt has served on Georgetown’s board of
directors and board of regents.  “The issues facing global leaders are more acute, dynamic
and interrelated than ever before,” McCourt said in the
statement. “We recognize an opportunity here to serve the world
in a new way through an innovative approach to public policy
research and analysis.”  Georgetown, a private Jesuit university, was founded in
1789. Graduates include  Bill Clinton , the 42nd president of the
U.S., and Paul Tagliabue, former commissioner of the National
Football League and current chairman of Georgetown’s board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
