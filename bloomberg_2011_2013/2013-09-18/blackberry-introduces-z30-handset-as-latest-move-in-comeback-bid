BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  will start selling
its largest smartphone yet in the U.K. and  Middle East  next
week, the latest step in a bid to turn around the struggling
Canadian device maker.  The Z30, which has a 5-inch touch screen and is based on a
newer version of the BlackBerry 10 operating system, was
unveiled today at a Kuala Lumpur event, according to a
statement. Prices will be announced by the phone’s carriers.  The company is counting on its new range of BlackBerry 10
phones to deliver a return to sales growth and profitability as
it tries to regain market share from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930)  Sales two quarters ago missed analyst estimates
by almost 1 million units, and Waterloo, Ontario-based
BlackBerry said last month it would consider putting itself up
for sale or forging new partnerships.  BlackBerry, which traditionally made devices featuring a
physical keyboard, in January unveiled the Z10 with a 4.2-inch
touch screen that more closely resembled handsets like the
iPhone. The Z30 has a 1.7-gigahertz processor, stereo speakers
to improve conversation quality, and the largest battery ever
built into a BlackBerry.  The stock fell 1.5 percent to $10.40 at the close in  New
York . The shares have dropped 12 percent this year and remain
more than 90 percent below their 2008 high. BlackBerry will
report fiscal second-quarter  earnings  on Sept. 27.  The worldwide mobile-phone market is forecast to grow 7.3
percent to pass 1 billion units for the first time this year,
according to researcher IDC.  Apple, Google  BlackBerry, which already trailed  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android and
Apple’s iOS operating systems, also fell behind  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows Phone in the first half of this year, IDC said.
BlackBerry’s operating system will account for 2.7 percent of
smartphones this year, declining to 1.7 percent by 2017, IDC
said.  “BlackBerry OS share will decline markedly over the
forecast due to tepid BlackBerry 10 reception and emboldened
competition that are expected to whittle away share in its
remaining regional bastions of strength, such as  Africa ,  Latin
America , and the Middle East,” IDC said this month.  Constrained by its shrinking market share, BlackBerry said
in May it would begin offering its BBM instant-messaging
software as a free application on its bigger rivals’ devices.
The app will be available Sept. 21 for Android and the following
day for iPhone, BlackBerry said today in a separate statement.  Upgrade Delay  Morgan Stanley (MS)  is holding off on upgrading its employees to
BlackBerry 10 because of concerns the company may not be around
long-term to support the platform, two people with knowledge of
the bank’s plans said last month.  BlackBerry may cut as much as 40 percent of its staff by
the end of this year, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
The job reductions will be across the company and will happen in
stages, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the
matter.  BlackBerry had about 12,700 employees in March, the last
time the company gave a payroll figure, after Chief Executive
Officer Thorsten Heins cut 5,000 jobs in 2012 to save $1 billion
in operating costs. Adam Emery, a spokesman for the company,
declined to comment specifically on the 40 percent figure, which
would be the equivalent of about 5,000 jobs.  “Organizational moves will continue to occur to ensure we
have the right people in the right roles to drive new
opportunities in mobile computing,” the company said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
