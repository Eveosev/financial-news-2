Ethanol rose the most in more than
a week after a government report showed stockpiles of the fuel
declined and after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly left intact
its level of bond buying.  Futures jumped 3.3 percent after the Fed said it would
continue buying $85 million in Treasuries each month.
Separately, an Energy Information Administration report showed
record-low  ethanol supply  and  below-average production  levels
for this time of year.  “Those were bullish stats,” said Ian Jackson, a trader at
SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago. “The market’s genuinely
tight.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery rose 5.9 cents, or
3.3 percent, to $1.844 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have dropped 16 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery advanced 8.1 cents, or 3
percent, to $2.7421 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, widening its premium to ethanol by 2.2 cents to 89.81
cents. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made primarily from corn in the U.S., with one
bushel making at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  Corn for December delivery added 2.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $4.5625 a bushel in  Chicago . The December crush
spread of corn to ethanol was minus 2 cents a gallon. All of the
crush spreads through 2015 were negative.  Ethanol  production  fell 1.2 percent to 838,000 barrels a
day last week, the Energy Department’s analytical arm said in
the report today.  Stockpiles Drop  Stockpiles dropped 0.6 percent to 16.2 million barrels, 16
percent lower than a year earlier, the EIA said, while  imports 
tumbled 80 percent to 3,000 barrels a day, the smallest since
June 28, when the U.S. made no foreign purchase of the additive.  Anhydrous ethanol in Sao Paulo, where sugarcane is used to
make the biofuel, rose 3.8 percent to $2.14 a gallon last week,
a seven-week high, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol is part of the country’s energy plans to reduce
dependence on fossil fuels. Compliance with federal consumption
targets is tracked by Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
that are attached to each batch of biofuel and that can be
traded among refiners.  Corn-based-ethanol RINs added 4 cents to 52 cents, while
advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, climbed 4 cents to 61 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 5 cents to $2.185 in
New York, 7 cents to $2.36 in Chicago and 8.5 cents to $2.445 on
the Gulf Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show. On the West
Coast, it fell 4.5 cents $2.31.  West Coast ethanol’s discount to the Gulf stretched 13
cents to 13.5 cents. Chicago’s premium to New York Harbor
swelled 2 cents to 17.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
