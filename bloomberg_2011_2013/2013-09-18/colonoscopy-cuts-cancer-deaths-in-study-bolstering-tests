Colonoscopy is more effective than
less-invasive sigmoidoscopy in preventing colorectal tumors and
death, according to a study that supports recommendations for
screening every 10 years.  While the study confirms earlier work that showed
sigmoidoscopy prevents tumors and deaths from colorectal cancer,
it found colonoscopy goes much further. It prevents cancer
throughout the colon and cuts the risk of dying from it by 68
percent, according to the study published today in the  New
England Journal of Medicine .  “This study provides some of the clearest evidence to date
that  colonoscopy  has advantages over sigmoidoscopy for the
prevention of colorectal cancer, although it is not a perfect
test,” said Andrew Chan, one of the senior authors of the paper
and associate professor of medicine at  Harvard Medical School .  Both approaches use a flexible tube with a light and a
camera attached to examine the lining of the colon. A
colonoscopy covers the entire length of the colon, requires
preparation to clear out the bowel and generally involves
sedation. A sigmoidoscopy covers the lower third of the colon on
the left side, involves less bowel preparation and no sedation.  Doctors using either approach can snip off potentially
dangerous polyps that are or can become cancerous. Patients who
had a negative colonoscopy were less likely to develop colon
cancer during the following 15 years, while those who had a
polyp removed had a lower risk for just five years, the study
found. The  American Cancer Society  currently recommends that
people get screened at age 50 and once a decade thereafter.  Fecal Test  A second study of 46,551 patients followed for 30 years
confirmed testing blood in fecal matter could detect cancer and
reduce deaths. Annual screening using the simple test reduced
deaths by 32 percent, while use every other year cut it by 22
percent, according to the follow-up of  the Minnesota Colon
Cancer Control Study .  The results suggest fecal occult-blood testing remains an
acceptable method of screening, the researchers said. After a
positive result, patients typically undergo colonoscopy and the
removal of any polyps. It’s the removal of those polyps that
otherwise may have turned into cancer that most likely provided
the survival benefit, the researchers said.  The  American Cancer Society  estimates 143,000 people in the
U.S. will be diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer in 2013, and
almost 51,000 will die from the conditions. They are the second
most common cause of cancer death, after lung tumors.  Study Details  The colonoscopy investigation involved 88,902 volunteers
from the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals
Follow-up Study and recorded those who underwent a colonoscopy,
sigmoidoscopy or neither. They filled out questionnaires every
two years between 1988 and 2008. By June 2012, 1,815 developed
colorectal cancer and 474 died from it.  If everyone in the study had received a colonoscopy, there
would have been 40 percent fewer colon cancers, said lead author
Reiko Nishihara, from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the
Harvard School of  Public Health .  The researchers also found that tumors discovered within
five years of a colonoscopy were more likely to be a sessile
serrated adenoma, a hard-to-detect polyp that may also be fast-growing. Additional efforts to find and remove those polyps are
critical, according to Chan, who also works at the  Massachusetts
General Hospital ’s Gastrointestinal Unit.  The sessile serrated polyps have only come to doctors’
attention in the past few years, said James Church, a colorectal
surgeon at the  Cleveland Clinic , who wasn’t involved with the
research. The findings should serve as notice to doctors doing
exams to improve the quality, he said in a telephone interview.  “If you’re getting a colonoscopy, you should make sure the
person you’re going to is good,” he said. “You always want a
good plumber, a good mechanic, a good electrician. But when it
comes to a colonoscopy, it could mean your life.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
