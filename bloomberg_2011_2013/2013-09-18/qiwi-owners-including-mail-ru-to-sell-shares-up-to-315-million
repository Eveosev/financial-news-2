Qiwi Plc (QIWI) , a Russian electronic-payment operator, said its investors plan to sell as much as
$315 million worth of shares, after the stock almost doubled
since an initial public offering in May.  They will sell as many as 9.4 million shares for as much as
$33.395 apiece, Qiwi said in a regulatory  filing  dated
yesterday. Billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s  Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL)  will
sell 2.1 million shares, Japan’s Mitsui & Co. will sell 3.5
million shares, and the rest will be offered by management and
smaller shareholders. Credit Suisse will manage the offering.  Qiwi operates cash-collecting terminals and online-payment
systems, and processes payments for more than 54,000 merchants.
Managers led by Chief Executive Officer Sergey Solonin control
almost 60 percent of Qiwi’s voting shares.  Qiwi’s second-quarter adjusted net revenue rose 62 percent
from a year earlier to 1.56 billion rubles ($48.4 million), the
company said in an August statement. The company also approved a
dividend of 32 U.S. cents a share, and raised its forecast range
for growth in adjusted net profit this year to 35 percent to 40
percent, compared with previous guidance of 27 percent to 33
percent.  Qiwi shares declined 3.2 percent to $32.97 at 11:15 a.m. in
 New York  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
