U.S. shipyards are the busiest in
almost two decades as surging domestic energy production
increases cargoes for the merchant fleet, according to the
Department of Transportation.  Fifteen tanker and container ships are on order or under
construction in the U.S., with options for “many more,” Paul Jaenichen, acting maritime administrator at the department, said
at the TradeWinds Jones Act Shipping Forum in New York. That’s
the biggest boom in almost 20 years, he said.  The U.S. is the closest in decades to achieving energy
independence because of oil and gas extracted from shale rocks,
Jaenichen said. The Jones Act requires cargoes being shipped
between U.S. ports to be carried on domestically built vessels
with American crews. The maritime industry contributes $46
billion to the country’s economy, according to Jaenichen.  “America’s Jones Act fleet will benefit from this new and
abundant cargo source,” he said. “When domestic cargoes are
moving, U.S. ships are moving them. The Jones Act works.”  Hire rates for tankers in the U.S. rose to a record
$100,000 a day for a one-year charter, Bob Flynn, president of
shipbroker MJLF & Associates in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said at
the forum.  “We need another shipyard or two,” he said. “It wouldn’t
surprise me if the next boil on this market pushed rates up to
$85,000 a day, sustainable, five-year deals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
