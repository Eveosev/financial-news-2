The threat of cyber attacks on the
U.S. financial system is growing as new online products emerge
and weapons for hackers become more accessible, said Comptroller
of the Currency Thomas Curry.  “The growing sophistication and frequency of cyber attacks
is a cause for concern, not only because of the potential for
disruption, but also because of the potential for destruction of
the systems and information that support our banks,” Curry said
in remarks prepared for delivery today at the Exchequer Club in
 Washington .  With consumers more dependent on computer access to their
accounts and the banks seeking new mobile products, social
networks and cloud computing, the firms face “global networks
of well-organized nation-states, criminals, ‘hacktivists,’ and
insiders that operate outside of the walls of our judicial
system.” Banks such as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  have been hit with
distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, website attacks in which
hackers flood systems with information to shut them down.  Curry, who also leads the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council, an interagency group that coordinates
practices and standards across the U.S. banking agencies. Curry
said the FFIEC has established a cyber-security group that has
been meeting with intelligence and law-enforcement officials.  Defending the financial system will require information
sharing between agencies and among companies “for the good of
our country,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
