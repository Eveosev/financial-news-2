European stocks  advanced, sending
the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index near a five-year high, as investors
awaited the  Federal Reserve ’s decision on reducing monthly bond
purchases.  Siemens AG climbed to a two-year high after appointing a
new chief financial officer and a supervisory-board member.
HeidelbergCement AG added 1.4 percent after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. recommended the stock. Lanxess AG dropped 2.8 percent as
investors weighed its cost-cutting plan.  The Stoxx 600 gained 0.4 percent to 313.28, closing less
than 0.1 percent below a five-year high it reached on Sept. 16.
The gauge has rallied  12 percent  so far this year as central
banks pressed on with their supportive policies.  “The whole environment for growth does seem to have
deteriorated slightly since June when the Fed last really spoke
to the market,” Lucy MacDonald, chief investment officer for
equities at Allianz Global Investors in London, told  Mark Barton 
on Bloomberg Television. Her company oversees about $419
billion. “If they don’t do anything at all that may raise
questions and people will be more concerned about growth.
Clearly we need to have the comfort that the economic recovery
is still well underpinned.”  A  gauge  of implied volatility in euro-area stocks, based on
options prices, fell 4.3 percent today, the most in one week.  Fed Tapering  The  Federal Open Market Committee  wraps up a two-day policy
meeting today, at which it will probably decide to lower its $85
billion of monthly bond purchases. Among 64 economists surveyed
by  Bloomberg News , 33 predicted the Fed will reduce its buying
of Treasuries by $5 billion or less, with 31 projecting a cut of
$10 billion or more.  Earlier this month, a Bloomberg News survey of 34
economists forecast a $10 billion reduction. In a July poll,
half of the 54 respondents predicted a $20 billion cut.  The FOMC releases both its policy statement and forecasts
for economic growth, inflation and unemployment at 2 p.m.  New
York  time, after the European markets close. Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  will hold a press conference half an hour later.  The  Bank of England  today released the minutes from its
Sept. 4-5 meeting, which showed that officials unanimously
concluded there was no need for additional stimulus given an
improving outlook for the British economy.  Housing Starts  In the U.S.,  housing starts  climbed to a 891,000 annualized
pace in August from a revised 883,000 rate the previous month,
Commerce Department Data figures showed. That missed the median
projection of 917,000 in a Bloomberg survey.  National benchmark indexes rose in 15 of the 18 western
European markets today.  Germany ’s DAX advanced 0.5 percent. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.2 percent.  France ’s CAC 40 increased
0.6 percent.  Siemens gained 1.3 percent to 89.70 euros, the highest
price since July 2011. Europe’s biggest engineering company
appointed SAP AG’s co-Chief Executive Officer Jim Hagemann Snabe
to its supervisory board and named Ralf Thomas CFO.  Snabe will take the place of  Josef Ackermann , who is
leaving, as director, while former Bayer AG Chief Executive
Officer Werner Wenning will replace him as the deputy chairman.  HeidelbergCement gained 1.4 percent to 58.20 euros as
Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the cement maker to buy from
sell, saying increased spending will drive growth opportunities.
The stock is trading at 16.6 times projected earnings, compared
with 16.5 times for the Stoxx 600 Construction and Materials
Index.  Smiths Dividend  Smiths Group Plc (SMIN)  advanced 2.6 percent to 1,412 pence. The
U.K. producer of security scanners increased its  final dividend 
to 27 pence a share and announced an additional payout of 30
pence per share.  Lanxess AG fell 2.8 percent to 49.95 euros. The synthetic-rubber maker said it will cut 1,000 jobs and curb management
bonuses as part of a plan to save about 100 million euros ($134
million) annually from 2015.  Citigroup Inc. said the proposal will put additional
pressure on the company’s cash flow in the short term. Goldman
said investors may sell the stock in the absence of a more
significant plan. Baader Bank AG analyst Norbert Barth, who has
a sell rating on the stock, said Lanxess may lower its dividend
from last year’s 1 euro per share.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc fell 3.5 percent to 367.3
pence. Morgan Stanley cut its projections for the company’s 2014
and 2015 earnings by about 6 percent and 7 percent respectively,
citing equity outflows and weak fund performance. Aberdeen will
release a trading update on Sept. 23, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
