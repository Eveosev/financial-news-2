Novozymes A/S (NZYMB) , the Danish
biotechnology company, will sell enzymes to  Brazil ’s Raizen for
a cellulosic-ethanol plant it is building.  Novozymes will build a factory to produce enzymes in
Brazil, the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company said today on its
 website .  While Raizen may be able to produce ethanol from sugar-cane
byproducts as cheaply as from the crop’s juice, it’s still more
profitable to burn the organic waste into electricity and sell
it to the grid, Antonio Stuchi, agribusiness executive for
Raizen, said today in an interview in Sao Paulo.  “Enzymes are the biggest component of costs” for
cellulosic-ethanol production, he said. “We expect their cost
to fall in the same way that they did for corn-ethanol processes
in the U.S.”  Novozymes agreed to supply enzymes to Raizen’s second
cellulosic-ethanol plant if the Brazilian company chooses to
build one, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
