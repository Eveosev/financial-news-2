Japanese  stocks  rose before the
U.S. Federal Reserve announces whether it will cut stimulus,
with shippers and airlines leading gains.  The  Topix index  gained 0.5 percent to 1,187.68 as of 9:00
a.m. in  Tokyo  after falling 0.3 percent yesterday. All but one
of the 33 industry groups advanced. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
added 0.7 percent to 14,406.50.  “Investors are becoming somewhat more inclined to take on
risk amid optimism about U.S. monetary policy,” said Hiroaki Hiwada, a strategist at Toyo Securities Co. in Tokyo. “But the
market will be choppy after being bought in the morning as we
await the Fed’s announcement.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The measure rose 0.4 percent yesterday, as
Microsoft Corp. announced a $40 billion buyback and the two-day
Fed meeting began.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will probably lower its
$85 billion of monthly bond purchases by $5 billion, according
to the median response of economists in a Bloomberg News survey
this month. That’s down from a forecast of a $20 billion
reduction in a July survey.  The Topix rose 37 percent this year through yesterday,
making Japanese equities the best performers among developed
markets. The measure  traded  at 1.23 times book value yesterday,
compared with 2.51 for the S&P 500 and 1.76 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
