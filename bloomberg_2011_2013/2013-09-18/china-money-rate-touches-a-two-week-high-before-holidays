China ’s benchmark money-market rate
climbed to a two-week high as demand for cash increased ahead of
local holidays.  The People’s Bank of China pumped 8 billion  yuan  ($1.3
billion) into markets yesterday via seven-day reverse-repurchase
agreements to help boost fund supply. Chinese markets will close
on Sept. 19 and 20 for the mid-Autumn festival and Oct. 1 to 7
for National Day holidays.  “We’ll probably see the money market remain in a tight
balance,” said Li Yiming, an analyst at Citic Securities Co. in
Beijing. “After the June experience, banks know how to increase
reserves to prepare for quarter-end cash demand.”  The seven-day  repurchase  rate, a gauge of funding
availability in the banking system, rose five basis points, or
0.05 basis point, to 3.71 percent as of 10:50 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. The rate touched 3.74 percent earlier,
the highest since Sept. 3.  The cost of one-year  interest-rate swaps , the fixed payment
to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, was steady at 4.03
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank  drained  a net 1.1 billion yuan from the
financial system last week, following a withdrawal of 37 billion
yuan in the previous period.  The yield on the 4.08 percent sovereign debt due August
2023 declined one basis point to 4.08 percent, according to
prices from the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
