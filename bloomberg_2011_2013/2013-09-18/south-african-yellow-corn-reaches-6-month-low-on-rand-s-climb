South African yellow corn futures
slid to the lowest level in more than six months after the rand
strengthened this week, lowering the cost of imports.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, dropped 0.6 percent to 2,133 rand ($217) a metric ton,
the lowest settlement price since Feb. 26, by the midday close
on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. The white
variety for delivery the same month fell 1 percent to 2,296.20
rand a ton, the lowest since Aug. 14.  The rand gained 0.9 percent against the dollar so far this
week.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of the
grain. A meal made from white corn is one of South Africa’s
staple foods and yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
