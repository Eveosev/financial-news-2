Gasoline rose from a nine-month low
after the industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported
yesterday that supplies of the motor fuel fell last week.  Futures advanced as much as 0.5 percent. The API reported
that gasoline inventories declined 541,000 barrels in the week
ended Sept. 13. The Energy Information Administration will
probably report today that gasoline supplies rose 500,000
barrels, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg.  “Gasoline may have gotten some support from the API but
the market in general is expecting a build,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “Gasoline
supplies continue to be more than adequate for this time of year
and gasoline remains under pressure.  Gasoline for October delivery rose 1.13 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.6724 a gallon at 10 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after settling yesterday at the lowest
level since Dec. 17. Trading volume was 0.4 percent below the
100-day average.  The EIA is scheduled to report last week’s inventories at
10:30 a.m. today in  Washington .  The  Federal Reserve ’s Federal Open Market Committee will
probably announce at 2 p.m. in Washington that it will reduce
monthly Treasury purchases by $5 billion to $40 billion, while
maintaining its buying of mortgage-backed securities at $40
billion, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  ‘‘The market will probably absorb the inventory stats and
wait for the Fed announcement,” Lipow said.  Crack Spreads  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 2 cents to $6.33 a barrel. The
fuel’s  premium  over Brent increased 43 cents to $3.52.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to $3.506 a
gallon, 35.3 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA
said today on its website. Prices have fallen 16 consecutive
days to the lowest level since July 9.  Ultra-low sulfur diesel touched a five-week low as
increasing European gasoil supplies and lower prices reduce
export opportunities for U.S. refiners.  Gasoil for October delivery fell 0.5 percent to $920.75 a
metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. Gasoil stockpiles
in independent storage at Europe’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
trading hub increased 4.4 percent in the week ended Sept. 12,
according to PJK International BV. The EIA will probably report
today that distillate inventories rose 500,000 barrels last
week, according to the survey.  “The weakness in gasoil in Europe is translating into a
weaker diesel price in  New York  Harbor as the U.S. continues to
be a major exporter of fuel to the European market,” Lipow
said.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery fell 0.4 cent
to $2.9943 a gallon on the Nymex. Trading volume was 30 percent
above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 57 cents to $19.94
a barrel. The  premium  over Brent fell 2 cents to $17.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
