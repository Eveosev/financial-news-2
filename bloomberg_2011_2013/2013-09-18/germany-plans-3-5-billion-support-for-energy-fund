Germany  plans to use 2.59 billion
euros ($3.5 billion) in federal money to save an energy and
climate fund suffering from low prices for carbon in Europe.  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government seeks to divert the
cash from the budget to the EKF fund from next year through
2017, it wrote in a  bill . The EKF, designed to be financed with
proceeds from carbon-permit sales, has failed to reap sufficient
income after prices for the allowances dropped to about 4 euros
a metric ton this year, the government said.  The fund is part of Germany’s 550 billion-euro plan to wean
the country off nuclear energy and more than triple the share of
renewables to account for 80 percent of the power mix. It’s
aimed at financing climate-protection programs and research into
renewables,  energy storage  and power-grid technologies as well
as  energy efficiency  and electric mobility.  “The income side of the EKF needs to be strengthened to
secure financing for the energy switch’s programs,” the
government wrote in the bill that was first reported today by
the parliament’s official newsletter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
