Renault SA (RNO)  and partner Nissan Motor
Co. created a parts-procurement venture with  OAO AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) ,
Russia’s biggest carmaker, as the manufacturers seek to limit
costs as they expand in the country in a three-way tie-up.  The venture is modeled on the 12-year-old Renault-Nissan
Purchasing Organization, which holds a 50 percent stake in the
new Russian entity, with Togliatti-based  AvtoVAZ (AVAZ)  owning the
other half, the companies said in a joint statement today.  Renault, France’s second-biggest carmaker, and Yokohama,
Japan-based Nissan are in the process of acquiring control of
AvtoVAZ, the maker of Lada vehicles, under an agreement signed
late last year that pledges the buyers to invest 23 billion
rubles ($713 million). Renault Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn , who also runs Nissan and is chairman of AvtoVAZ’s board
of directors, has targeted a 40 percent combined market share in
Russia for the three companies by 2016.  The three manufacturers are planning joint annual
production capacity in Russia of 1.7 million vehicles by that
year, Mia Nielsen, a spokeswoman for the Renault-Nissan
Alliance, said today in an e-mail. Renault, which is based in
the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, has been Nissan’s
partner in sales and production since 1999 and currently  owns 
about a 43 percent stake.  Eight-month Russian deliveries by Renault, Nissan and
AvtoVAZ fell 9 percent from a year earlier to 533,822 vehicles,
according to  figures  compiled by the Moscow-based Association of
European Businesses in Russia. Their combined market share
narrowed to 29.7 percent from 30.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
