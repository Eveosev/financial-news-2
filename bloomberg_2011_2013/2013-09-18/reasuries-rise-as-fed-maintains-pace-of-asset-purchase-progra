Treasuries rallied the most in
almost two years after the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly
maintained the pace of monthly bond purchases that have made the
central bank the largest holder of U.S. government debt.  “The Committee decided to await more evidence that
progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its
purchases,” the  Federal Open Market Committee  said today at the
conclusion of a two-day meeting in  Washington , referring to its
quantitative easing program. Most policy makers expect the first
increase in the nation’s benchmark  lending rate  to occur in 2015
as they seek to use the quantitative-easing strategy to sustain
economic growth.  “I’m not sure you can count on the end of QE by mid-next
year anymore,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock Inc.’s co-head of fixed
income in the Americas, whose New York-based firm is the world’s
largest money manager with $3.86 trillion in assets, said during
a telephone interview. “The Fed opened the door to keeping QE
on the table until the data suggests very much they should start
removing it.”  The   yield  on the benchmark 10-year note fell 16 basis
points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 2.69 percent at 4:59 p.m.
in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the
biggest drop since Oct. 31, 2011. The price of the 2.5 percent
note maturing in August 2023 rose 1 11/32, or, $13.44 per $1,000
face value, to 98 11/32.  Economists had forecast the FOMC would dial down monthly
Treasury purchases by $5 billion, to $40 billion, while
maintaining its buying of mortgage-backed securities at $40
billion, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Volume Surges  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose 52 percent to $457
billion, the most since June 26. The 2013 average is $316.4
billion.  “Once stimulus removal begins, it cannot be quickly
reversed, and the Fed is afraid to let the economy try to make
it on its own,”  Jeffrey Gundlach , manager of the $36 billion
DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund, wrote in an e-mail.  Yields on 10-year notes, the  benchmark  rate on loans
ranging from mortgages to corporate bonds, climbed as high as 3
percent Sept. 5 from 1.93 percent on May 21, the day before
Bernanke said that the central bank could slow the pace of
Treasury and mortgage bond purchases in the next few policy
meetings.  “They don’t want to taper just because they have been
talking about it. They want to look at the data and just play it
day by day,” said  Sean Simko , who oversees $8 billion at SEI
Investments Co. in Oaks,  Pennsylvania . “This will set the tone
of the market for the next couple of weeks, then we’ll wait to
see what the minutes say when they are released.”  Funds Forecast  The  federal funds rate target  will be 2 percent at the end
of 2016, according to the median of estimates by five governors
on the Fed’s board and 12 reserve bank presidents. That rate
compares with their median estimate of 4 percent for where the
rate should be at a time of full employment and stable prices.  Twelve of 17 Fed officials see the first rate rise
occurring in 2015, and two see it happening in 2016, the
forecasts showed. Three officials predicted the first increase
in 2014.  In June, 14 fed officials predicted the first rate increase
in 2015 and one saw it coming in 2016. The June meeting had two
more officials than today’s meeting had.  Today was the first time the FOMC released officials’ 2016
outlook for the funds rate and economic indicators.  Growth Estimates  The fed officials estimated the economy would expand at a
2.5 percent to 3.3 percent rate in 2016, driving unemployment
down to 5.4 percent to 5.9 percent with inflation at 1.7 percent
to 2 percent, according to their central tendency estimates. The
 unemployment rate  was in line with Fed officials’ longer-run
estimate for full employment of 5.2 percent to 5.8 percent.  Gross domestic product will probably grow at a 2 percent
annualized pace in the third quarter after expanding at a 2.5
percent rate in the prior three months, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg Sept. 6-11.  The Fed has kept  interest rates  at almost zero since
December 2008 and undertaken three rounds of bond buying that
have swelled its  balance sheet  to a record of $3.66 trillion.
Fed funds futures contract show a 39 percent likelihood that the
fed will boost its overnight benchmark rate by at least 25 basis
points by December 2014, and a 46.7 percent probability of an
increase by January 2015.  ‘Dovish Result’  “The Fed took people by surprise by not taking any actions
with regard to tapering,” said Gary Pollack, who manages $12
billion as head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s
Private Wealth Management unit in New York. “This is a dovish
result.”  Volatility as measured by the Merrill Lynch Option
Volatility Estimate Index dropped 9 percent to 82.75, the lowest
level since Aug. 14. It has declined from a two-month high of
114.19 on Sept. 5.  Ending the Fed’s third round of quantitative easing carries
greater significance than completion of the previous two because
QE3 involves open-ended purchases, both in amount and duration,
whereas its predecessors were introduced with defined purchase
levels over a fixed period of time.  “The market made a big mistake,” said  Jim Bianco ,
president of Bianco Research LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “ Wall Street  made the mistake of taking silence from
the Fed as approval of tapering, when instead the silence was
because of a lack of consensus among the policy makers there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
