U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline
strengthened for the first time in four days after  Phillips 66 (PSX) 
said it was carrying out maintenance in  Louisiana  and a
government report showed stockpiles in the region declined.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast gained 1.75 cents to a discount of 15.5 cents a gallon
versus New York Mercantile Exchange futures at 1:48 p.m., the
strongest since Sept. 13.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  added
1 cent to 13 cents a gallon below futures.  Inventories of gasoline  in the region, known as PADD 3,
dropped 142,000 barrels to 77.7 million in the week ended Sept.
13, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Distillate stockpiles slid 795,000 barrels to 41.2 million,
after reaching the highest since June 7 a week earlier.  The decline in distillate inventories, including heating
oil and diesel, was led by an increase in exports to  Europe ,
according to a research note from Energy Aspects Ltd.
“Anecdotal evidence” also suggests two to three tankers have
left the Gulf Coast recently for the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
region, the report showed.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel on the Gulf Coast was
unchanged at 3.38 cents a gallon below Nymex futures.  The 3-2-1  crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , increased 36 cents to $6.12 a
barrel. The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet Oil gained 56
cents to $5.32 a barrel, the  first rise  in three days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
