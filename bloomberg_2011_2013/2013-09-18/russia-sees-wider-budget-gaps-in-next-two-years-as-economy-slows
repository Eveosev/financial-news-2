Russia ’s fiscal deficit will be
wider than previously planned in the next two years as slower
economic growth curbs budget revenue in the world’s biggest
energy exporter, the Finance Ministry said.  The shortfall will reach 0.5 percent of gross domestic
product in 2014 and 1 percent in 2015, compared with earlier
estimates for a 0.2 percent gap next year and a balanced budget
12 months later, the ministry said today in materials prepared
for a cabinet meeting. This year’s deficit forecast was cut to
0.7 percent from 0.8 percent, it said.  Russia is grappling with its steepest slowdown since a 2009
recession, with second-quarter GDP rising 1.2 percent from a
year earlier and the Economy Ministry cutting its 2013 growth
forecast last month to 1.8 percent from 2.4 percent. Income-tax
revenue fell 20 percent from a year earlier in the first eight
months, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told a Sept. 12
government meeting.  “The increase in the deficit estimate is due to some
lowering of the growth forecasts and some increase in
spending,” Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief economist for Russia at
Bank of America, said today by phone from Moscow. The 300
billion-ruble ($9.3 billion) net increase in next year’s
shortfall “will most likely be financed by domestic
borrowing.”  Stocks Trail  Russian stocks are underperforming their peers, with the
dollar-denominated RTS Index down 6.4 percent this year compared
with a 5.5 percent drop for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index. The
ruble has weakened 5.5 percent against the dollar in 2013,
compared with 8.8 percent for the Brazilian real and 13.2
percent for the Indian rupee.  Russia needs to cut budget spending in areas excluding
pensions, welfare and debt servicing by as much as 5 percent in
2014-2016, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said last week.
Revenue will reach 13.6 trillion rubles next year and 14.5
trillion in 2015, while spending will total 13.98 trillion and
15.4 trillion, according to the Finance Ministry.  The ministry made the biggest revision to its estimates for
revenue from state asset sales. Proceeds are planned at 197
billion rubles next year, down from 331 billion rubles, and 159
billion rubles in 2015, down from 595 billion rubles. The 2016
sale of a 19.5 percent stake in the nation’s biggest oil
producer,  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , will generate 423.5 billion rubles, the
ministry forecasts.  Delays in Russia’s privatization program are being caused
by “the energetic lobbying of individual agencies and
individual officials,” Medvedev said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
