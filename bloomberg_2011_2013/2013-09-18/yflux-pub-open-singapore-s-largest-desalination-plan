(Corrects to first desalination facility in last sentence
of story that moved Sept. 18.)  Hyflux Ltd. (HYF)  and Singapore’s
national water agency PUB today opened the city-state’s largest
seawater reverse-osmosis desalination plant.  The Tuaspring plant has a daily capacity of 70 million
gallons, or 318,500 cubic meters, Singapore’s biggest publicly
traded water company said in a stock exchange filing.  With the opening of the facility in Tuas in western
Singapore, desalinated water will meet as much as 25 percent of
the demand in the Southeast Asian country, it said. Singapore
has a population of about 5.3 million.  The desalination plant, Singapore’s second, will supply PUB
with potable water for 25 years, it said. Hyflux built
Singapore’s first desalination facility, SingSpring, which
started commercial operations in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
