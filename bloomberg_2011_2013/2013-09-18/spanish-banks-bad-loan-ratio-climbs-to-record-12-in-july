Spanish  defaults  as a proportion of
total lending jumped to a record in July as the recession-hit
economy spurred missed payments and banks complied with new
rules on classifying refinanced loans.  Non-performing loans  accounted for 11.97 percent of lending
in July compared with a revised 11.63 percent in June and 10.09
percent in the same month a year earlier, the Bank of  Spain  said
on its website today. The stock of bad loans rose to 178.7
billion euros ($239 billion) in July from the previous month as
2.02 billion euros of credit soured, it said.  More companies and consumers are failing to keep up with
repayments on borrowing as Spain struggles to emerge from an
economic slump in its sixth year that left the  unemployment rate 
at 26 percent. Banks are also in the process of reviewing as
much as 208 billion euros of refinanced or restructured loans to
meet a Sept. 30 deadline set by the Bank of Spain to ensure
those assets have been properly classified.  Analysts point out that the bad loans ratio in Spain is
much higher than the amount reported by the Bank of Spain should
items such as assets transferred by state-aided lenders to a new
 bad bank  enter the equation.  The total stock of non-performing loans may be as much as
285 billion euros, Exane BNP Paribas analysts including Santiago
Lopez said in a report to clients last week. That’s equivalent
to a bad loans ratio approaching 19 percent, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
