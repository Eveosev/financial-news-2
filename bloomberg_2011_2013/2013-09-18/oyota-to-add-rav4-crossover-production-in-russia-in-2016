Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
largest automaker, plans to make a second vehicle at its plant
near Saint Petersburg to double production capacity at the
Russian site by 2016.  Toyota will invest 5.9 billion rubles ($180 million) to add
a manufacturing line for the current version of the RAV4
crossover, the European division of the Toyota City, Japan-based
carmaker said today in a statement. Expansion will include
hiring 800 people, and the plant will be able to make 100,000
vehicles a year.  “Since the RAV4 was launched in the Russian market in
2002, it has been extremely well received by Russian
consumers,” Didier Leroy, president of Toyota Motor  Europe ,
said in the statement. Through the investment, “we further
commit to continuing our contributions to the development of the
Russian automobile industry.”  The Japanese manufacturer has made the Camry sedan at its
Russian plant since 2007. The investment in the RAV4 will bring
Toyota’s total spending at the site since entering  Russia  to 16
billion rubles, the manufacturer said. Toyota’s market share in
the country, including the luxury Lexus brand,  increased  to 6.2
percent in the eight months through August from 6 percent a year
earlier, according to figures from the Moscow-based Association
of European Businesses in Russia.  Toyota also has a partnership with the Sollers-Bussan joint
venture of Russian automotive producer OAO Sollers and Tokyo-based Mitsui & Co. that  started assembling  the Land Cruiser
Prado sport-utility vehicle in Vladivostok this year. Initial
production capacity of that model is 1,000 vehicles a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
