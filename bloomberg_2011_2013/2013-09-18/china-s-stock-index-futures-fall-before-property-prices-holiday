China’s stocks  rose for the first
time in four days, led by Shanghai-based companies and property
developers. Trading volumes slid before the start of holidays.  Shanghai Lujiazui Finance & Trade Zone Development Co. (600663)  and
CTS International Logistics Corp. jumped 10 percent on
speculation Shanghai’s free-trade zone will increase demand for
trade and shipping.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , the nation’s
second-biggest developer, advanced 0.7 percent after new home
prices surged in the nation’s four major cities.  Goertek Inc. (002241) ,
an Apple Inc. supplier, led declines for technology stocks.  “The free-trade zone concept is what big players like to
leverage on and any related stocks can expect to be active,”
said Li Jun, a strategist at Central  China  Securities Co. in
Shanghai. “Trading was light because investors want to guard
against policy uncertainty and breaking news during holidays.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.3 percent to 2,191.85
at the close. Trading volumes were 18 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Beijing
and  Shanghai  home prices climbed 15 percent last month, while in
Shenzhen they gained 18 percent, the National Bureau of
Statistics said. Chinese markets will close on Sept. 19 and 20
for the mid-Autumn festival and Oct. 1 to 7 for National Day
holidays.  The Shanghai index has risen 12 percent from this year’s
low on June 27 as data ranging from exports to industrial output
showed growth is accelerating and as companies based in the city
surged after the State Council approved a free-trade zone.  Trade Zone  The CSI 300 Index added 0.2 percent to 2,432.51. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  retreated 0.4 percent. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index, the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 0.1 percent in New York
yesterday. The Shanghai index is valued at 8.8 times its
projected 12-month earnings, compared with the five-year average
of 12.6 times, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Shanghai Lujiazui jumped by the daily limit to 20.55  yuan .
CTS International added 10 percent to 16.56 yuan. Shanghai-based
China Eastern Airlines Corp. surged 2.6 percent to 3.11 yuan.
The three companies have posted gains ranging from 30 percent to
110 percent since Aug. 22, when China’s commerce ministry said
the government approved a free-trade zone in Shanghai.  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. (600000)  rose 1.6 percent to 11
yuan after it submitted plans to regulators to set up a branch
in the trade area. Detailed guidelines for the Shanghai zone
will be delayed until the official launch of the zone at the end
of the month and gradually released later in the year and next
year, the China Daily reported today.  Bubble Stocks  While Barclays Plc predicts the free-trade zone will help
turn Shanghai into a global hub for finance and shipping, Bank
Julius Baer & Co. says the rally is unjustified because the
government hasn’t announced details and any boost to profits may
take years to materialize.  “These concept stocks are of course a bubble,” Andy Xie,
one of  the 50 most influential people in global finance 
according to this year’s ranking by Bloomberg Markets magazine,
said in a phone interview from Hong Kong on Sept. 12. “The
free-trade zone will take a long time to develop and earnings
will show only years down the road.”  Poly Real Estate rose 0.7 percent to 10.66 yuan.  Gemdale
Corp. (600383)  climbed 0.6 percent to 6.26 yuan. China Merchants Property
Development Co. added 1.5 percent to 25.76 yuan.  Home Prices  New home prices in China’s four major cities jumped in
August by the most since January 2011, led by Guangzhou, on
expectations that the government won’t implement new nationwide
property curbs any time soon. Prices climbed in 69 of the 70
cities the government tracked last month from a year earlier,
the National Bureau of Statistics said.  Rising property prices will constrain room for further
easing of monetary policies and the government may start
tightening monetary and property industry policies after the
Communist Party meeting in November, Zhang Zhiwei, an economist
at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong, wrote in a note.  A measure of technology stocks in the CSI 300 fell 0.8
percent for the biggest loss among the 10 industry groups.
GoerTek slumped 1.8 percent to 38.13 yuan.  Neusoft Corp. (600718)  plunged
2.5 percent to 11.10 yuan.  EGing Photovoltaic Technology Co. led declines for solar
companies, tumbling 9.5 percent to 11.76 yuan.  Zhejiang
Sunflower Light Energy Science & Technology Co. (300111)  lost 2.9 percent
to 4.33 yuan.  The government will control the construction of new
photovoltaic manufacturing projects to curb excess capacity in
the world’s biggest maker of solar panels, while new producers
that expand capacity will be banned, the Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology said yesterday. A global oversupply
of solar panels led to a 20 percent plunge in average prices
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
