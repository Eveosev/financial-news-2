Crude options volatility fell as
underlying futures rose the most in three weeks after the
 Federal Reserve  said it will maintain monthly bond purchases to
stimulate economic growth.  At-the-money volatility for November options, a measure of
expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was 21.34
percent at 4:05 p.m., down from 21.84 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery rose
$2.46 to settle at $107.28 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Futures surged after the  Federal Open Market Committee 
said it will continue buying $85 million in Treasuries each
month.  Bets that prices would fall accounted for 52 percent of
electronic trading volume today.  November $110 calls were the most active options today,
gaining 66 cents to $1.45 a barrel on volume of 2,554 contracts.
The next-most active option, December $70 puts, dropped 1 cent
to 3 cents on volume of 2,531 lots.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 62 percent of
the 123,074 lots traded.  November $95 puts were the most-active options yesterday
with 6,661 contracts changing hands as they rose 10 cents to 34
cents a barrel. January $85 puts, the next-most active,
increased 10 cents to 53 cents on volume of 5,218 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
40,955 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 39,570 lots
and December $100 calls with 32,844.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
