Wheat futures rose for a second day
on signs of improved demand for U.S. exports after prices
touched a 14-month low. Soybeans and corn also advanced.  Wheat inspected for export jumped 56 percent to 46.024
million bushels in the week ended Sept. 12 from a year earlier,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said Sept. 16.  Sales  since
June 1 rose 38 percent to 602 million bushels as of Sept. 5 from
the same period a year earlier, the agency said. Average U.S.
 cash  prices fell Sept. 6 to the lowest since June 2012, down 20
percent this year, the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  said.  “U.S. exports have been better than expected this year and
are putting a floor under prices,”  Tom Leffler , the owner of
Leffler Commodities LLC in Augusta, Kansas, said in a telephone
interview. “The low prices have shut off farmer selling and
tightened up supplies.”  Wheat futures for delivery in December rose 0.5 percent to
close at $6.465 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, after gaining 0.3 percent yesterday. The most-active
contract touched a 14-month low on Aug. 14 at $6.355.  The price reached the day’s high after the  Federal Reserve 
unexpectedly refrained from reducing the pace of monthly bond
purchases,  Jerry Gidel , the chief feed-grain analyst for Rice
Dairy LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Soybean futures for delivery in November gained 0.4 percent
to $13.4775 a bushel on the CBOT, after declining 3.8 percent in
the prior three sessions. The oilseed added 7.6 percent since
the end of June on speculation that dry weather and heat would
hurt U.S. yields. The USDA cut its outlook for the national crop
by 3.3 percent last week to 3.149 billion bushels.  Corn futures for delivery in December climbed 0.5 percent
to $4.5625 a bushel in Chicago. The grain retreated 3.9 percent
in the prior four sessions and yesterday touched $4.5325, the
lowest for the most-active contract since Aug. 14. The USDA said
Sept. 12 farmers may harvest a record 13.843 billion bushels of
corn this year, up 28 percent from 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
