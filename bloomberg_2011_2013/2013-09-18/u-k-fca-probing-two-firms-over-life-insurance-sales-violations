The U.K.’s markets regulator is
investigating two companies over possible breaches of new rules
to remove payments by life insurers that encouraged salesmen to
promote their products.  The Financial Conduct Authority identified some life
insurers with arrangements still in place that may breach the
rules, known as the  Retail Distribution Review , and referred two
companies to its enforcement division, the regulator said in an
e-mailed  statement  today.  “The changes we made to the retail investment advice
sector were designed to mark a step change in the way advice was
given,” Clive Adamson, the FCA’s director of supervision, said
in the statement. “The findings of this review reveal that the
actions of some firms have the effect of undermining the
objectives of the RDR.”  The RDR was introduced to provide greater transparency for
consumers on payments for financial advice. The rules banned
U.K. financial advisers from taking commissions from fund
companies to sell their products.  To contact the reporter for this story:
