Most Federal Reserve policy makers
expect the first increase in the nation’s benchmark lending rate
to occur in 2015.  The  federal funds rate target  will be 2 percent at the end
of 2016, according to the median of estimates by five governors
on the Fed’s board and 12 reserve bank presidents. That rate
compares with their median estimate of 4 percent for where the
rate should be at a time of full employment and stable prices.  The outlook is part of the Fed’s forecasts released today
after the Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two-day
meeting in Washington. Twelve of 17 FOMC participants see the
first rate rise occurring in 2015, and two see it happening in
2016, the forecasts showed. Three participants predicted the
first increase in 2014.  In June, 14 FOMC participants predicted the first rate
increase in 2015 and one saw it coming in 2016. The June meeting
had two more participants than today’s meeting had.  Today was the first time the FOMC released officials’ 2016
outlook for the funds rate and economic indicators.  The FOMC participants estimated the economy would expand at
a 2.5 percent to 3.3 percent rate in 2016, driving unemployment
down to 5.4 percent to 5.9 percent with inflation at 1.7 percent
to 2 percent, according to their central tendency estimates. The
 unemployment rate  was in line with Fed officials’ longer-run
estimate for full employment of 5.2 percent to 5.8 percent.  Recent government reports have highlighted uneven progress
in the economic recovery, and policy makers today again lowered
their estimates for expansion for this year and the next.  GDP Outlook  Fed officials’ forecast U.S. gross domestic product to
increase 2 percent to 2.3 percent this year, 2.9 percent to 3.1
percent in 2014, and 3 percent to 3.5 percent in 2015, according
to the central tendency forecasts.  In June, they had estimated 2.3 percent to 2.6 percent
growth in 2013, 3 percent to 3.5 percent expansion in 2014 and
2.9 percent to 3.6 percent growth in 2015. The central tendency
forecasts exclude the three highest and three lowest
projections.  Recent declines in the unemployment rate have also caught
U.S. central bankers by surprise, with workers continuing to
leave the labor force while job growth remains subdued. Payrolls
increased less than estimated in August and joblessness fell to
7.3 percent, Labor Department figures showed Sept. 6.  Policy makers’ estimates for the jobless rate centered at
7.1 percent to 7.3 percent for this year, 6.4 percent to 6.8
percent for 2014 and 5.9 percent to 6.2 percent for the average
of the final three months in 2015.  Unemployment Forecasts  In June, those estimates were for 7.2 percent to 7.3
percent unemployment this year, 6.5 percent to 6.8 percent next
year, and 5.8 percent to 6.2 percent for 2015.  The Fed is also struggling to bring inflation back closer
to their 2 percent goal after a slowdown in price gains earlier
this year. Prices as measured by the personal consumption
expenditures index rose 1.4 percent in July from a year earlier.  Officials expected 1.1 percent to 1.2 percent inflation for
this year, 1.3 percent to 1.8 percent for 2014 and 1.6 percent
to 2 percent for 2015, the central tendency estimates showed.  In June, they had anticipated 0.8 percent to 1.2 percent
inflation for 2013, 1.4 percent to 2 percent inflation for 2014
and 1.6 percent to 2 percent inflation for 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
