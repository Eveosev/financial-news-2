Arcapita Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based investment house that filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S.
last year, exited bankruptcy after receiving a $350 million loan
from Goldman Sachs International.  Under the terms of the restructuring deal, a new entity
named RA Holding Corp., owned by the creditors, will realize the
value of Arcapita’s investment portfolio, the bank said in a
statement on its website. The Goldman Sachs-led loan will fund
cash flow requirements of the new entity and pay obligations
connected to the restructuring, it said.  Companies including  Kuwait ’s Global Investment House KSCC,
Dubai World Corp. and Dubai-based Nakheel PJSC were forced to
restructure billions of dollars of debt after lending evaporated
and asset values plummeted during the global credit crisis.
Arcapita filed for bankruptcy in March 2012 after negotiations
with creditors over a $1.1 billion syndicated loan failed.  “Chapter 11 was a challenging experience, but one which
has enabled us to deliver a solution in the best interests of
our investors, creditors, and other stakeholders,” Chief
Executive Officer Atif Abdulmalik said in the statement. “We
will be able both to assist RA and investors to maximize the
value of the existing investment portfolio and to undertake new
investment opportunities.”  The existing management team at Arcapita will continue to
lead the bank’s investment portfolio with the aim of maximizing
sale values.  The reorganization is effective from Sept. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
