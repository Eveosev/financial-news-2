The Cleveland Browns will start
third-string quarterback Brian Hoyer against the Minnesota
Vikings after  Brandon Weeden  sprained the thumb on his throwing
hand last week.  Browns coach Rob Chudzinski told Hoyer today that he’d be
given the Sept. 22 start over backup Jason Campbell.  “I feel like based on where we are offensively that
Brian’s strengths are the best fit this week and he gives us the
best chance to win,” Chudzinski said at a news conference.  It will be the second career National Football League start
for the 27-year-old Hoyer, an undrafted free agent from Michigan
State who previously played with the New England Patriots and
 Arizona  Cardinals. He made a start for the Cardinals last year,
throwing for 225 yards, one touchdown and one interception in a
loss at San Francisco.  Campbell, 31, has made 71 NFL starts. He took over at
quarterback for one series in last week’s 14-6 loss to the
Baltimore Ravens after Weeden injured his thumb when he struck a
teammate’s helmet after throwing a pass.  Chudzinski said Weeden will follow up with a hand
specialist tomorrow and the team probably will have a better
idea of how long he’ll be out later this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
