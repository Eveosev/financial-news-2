The U.K. plans to pay wind farms on
the Scottish Islands a higher subsidy to encourage development
of plants in remote regions that benefit from strong breezes.  Developers on the islands will receive 115 pounds ($184) a
megawatt-hour for power produced from 2017, according to a
consultation by the Department of Energy and Climate Change.
Projects in the rest of the U.K. will receive 95 pounds.  The higher cost of transporting power from plants on the
Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland has stalled developments,
often located in sparsely populated, windy regions. The U.K. is
seeking to get 30 percent of its electricity from renewables by
2020, up from about 12 percent now, and the islands could
provide about 1.5 percent of generation in that year, DECC said.  The cost per unit of power produced on Orkney and Shetland
is about 25 percent higher than on the mainland and 50 percent
higher on the Western Isles because of higher transmission and
operation expenses, according to the document published today.  The regions could accommodate more than 1.2 gigawatts of
renewable power, including about 1 gigawatt of onshore wind, by
2020, the consultation showed. Marine projects such as wave and
tidal plants off the islands wonâ€™t receive increased support
under the initial plans. The consultation closes Oct. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
