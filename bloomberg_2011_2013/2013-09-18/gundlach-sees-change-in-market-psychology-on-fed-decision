DoubleLine Capital LP’s  Jeffrey
Gundlach  said the psychology in bond markets may have changed
after the U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly maintained the pace
of monthly bond purchases, sending yields lower.  The yield on the  10-year note  fell as low as 2.67 percent
following the Fed’s announcement. A level below 2.7 percent
represents a “convincing change” in psychology after yields
rose above 3 percent earlier this month, Gundlach said today
during a webcast for investors.  “There are encouraging signs developing that it’s safer to
get back in the waters of fixed income,” Gundlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
