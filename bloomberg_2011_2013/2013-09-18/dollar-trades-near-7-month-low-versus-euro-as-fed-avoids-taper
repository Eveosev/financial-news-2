The yen tumbled, reaching the
weakest level in almost four years against the euro, as the
 Federal Reserve  unexpectedly retained a monetary policy that
prompts investors to borrow in low-interest-rate currencies to
buy higher-yielding assets.  Japan ’s currency slid against all 16 of its major peers
after a central-bank policy maker said pressure may mount to
expand stimulus. The dollar fluctuated against the euro after
falling to a seven-month low as Fed policy makers maintained
monthly bond purchases at $85 billion. Malaysia’s ringgit surged
the most since 1998 and  India ’s rupee advanced. The pound
weakened after U.K. retail sales unexpectedly fell.  “Carry trades are being carried out in a selective
fashion,”  Sebastien Galy , a senior foreign-exchange strategist
at Societe Generale SA in  New York , said in a phone interview.
“The large bearish long-dollar/short-Group of 10 currencies are
being unwound.” A long position is a bet that an asset will
increase in value.  The yen dropped 1.6 percent to 134.56 per euro at 5 p.m.
New York time, after touching the weakest since Nov. 12, 2009.
The Japanese currency slid 1.5 percent to 99.45 per dollar after
appreciating to 97.76 yesterday, the strongest level since Aug.
29. The U.S. currency slipped 0.1 percent to $1.3530 per euro
after reaching $1.3569, the weakest since Feb. 7.  Stocks Advance  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares advanced 1.7 percent,
while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.6 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent.  Takahide Kiuchi, the  Bank of Japan  board member most openly
critical of its monetary policy, said the central bank may come
under pressure to expand easing. “I can’t deny the possibility
that the Bank of Japan will be influenced by external factors
such as market expectations and will be forced to respond in
such a way,” Kiuchi said.  In the carry trade, investors borrow in low-interest-rate
currencies to buy higher-yielding assets. Japan’s benchmark rate
is virtually zero.  The Malaysian ringgit climbed 2.4 percent to 3.1565 per
dollar after gaining 2.8 percent, the biggest intraday advance
since September 1998. India’s rupee surged 2.5 percent to
61.7750 versus the U.S. currency.  Risk Rally  “Yesterday’s initial reaction was to clear out long
dollar-yen positions, now we’re returning to the typical risk-on
scenario,” said Michael Sneyd, a foreign-exchange strategist at
BNP Paribas SA in  London . “The currencies that correspond to
carry trades, the Aussie, Kiwi are doing well, while the yen is
doing badly.”  South Africa ’s rand depreciated for the first time this
week as investors gauged a surge to a four-month high against
the greenback was overdone.  South Africa’s currency depreciated 1.2 percent to 9.7053
per dollar after strengthening as much as 0.4 percent earlier to
the strongest level since May 24.  New Zealand ’s dollar was little changed after rallying as
much as 0.8 percent as a government report showed  gross domestic
product  grew 2.5 percent in the three months through June 30
from a year earlier, beating the median forecast of 2.3 percent
in a Bloomberg survey.  The kiwi traded at 83.74 U.S. cents, after reaching the
highest since May 9.  Pound Drops  Sterling weakened from almost an eight-month high against
the dollar after data showed U.K. retail sales including fuel
declined 0.9 percent from July. The median forecast of 20
economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.4 percent gain.  The pound declined 0.7 percent to $1.6032 after climbing to
$1.6163 yesterday, the most since Jan. 11. It fell 0.8 percent
to 84.40 pence per euro.  Fed policy makers said they want more proof of an economic
recovery before curbing their asset-buying program, known as
quantitative easing, surprising analysts predicting a $5 billion
cut to Treasury purchases.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said there is no fixed
schedule for tapering, which could still start this year.
 Interest rates  will stay near zero while unemployment exceeds
6.5 percent and inflation tops 2.5 percent, the Fed said in a
statement.  “The Fed statement was noticeably dovish,” said Yuki Sakasai, a foreign-exchange strategist in New York at Barclays
Plc. “There is expectation that there may be more QE.”  Week’s Results  The dollar declined 1.8 percent in the past week, the worst
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen lost 1.9 percent
and the euro gained 0.2 percent.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $32 billion, from $24 billion yesterday, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $6.6 billion, the largest share of
trades at 21 percent. Options on the euro-dollar rate totaled $6
billion, or 19 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 35 percent more than the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Euro-dollar options
trading was 228 percent more than average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
