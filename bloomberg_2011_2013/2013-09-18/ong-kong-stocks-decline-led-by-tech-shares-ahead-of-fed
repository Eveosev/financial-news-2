Hong Kong  stocks  fell for a second
day before the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee’s announces
whether it will pare record stimulus.  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) 
drove the benchmark index lower, while city developers climbed.  Tencent Holdings Ltd.,  China ’s No. 1 Internet company, fell
3.9 percent, retreating a second day from a record high.  Prada 
SpA, an Italian maker of luxury handbags, sank 1.4 percent after
missing profit estimates. Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd., the city’s
second-biggest builder, jumped 3.1 percent as CLSA Ltd.
reiterated its buy rating. Solar shares gained after China said
it will limit new factories to curb excess panel capacity.  The Hang Seng Index declined 0.3 percent to 23,117.45 at
the close in Hong Kong, its first back-to-back decline this
month. Trading volume was 26 percent below the 30-day average.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 0.6 percent to
10,588.01. The city’s markets are shut Sept. 20 for a holiday.  “The market is consolidating in absence of fresh
incentives and ahead of the FOMC results,” said  Ben Kwong ,
chief operating officer at KGI Asia Ltd. “The market already
had gains and many shares were overbought. We have a long
weekend coming up so investors don’t want to take heavy
positions.”  The H-share index entered a bull market last week after
rebounding more than 20 percent from a June low, while the  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  erased its 2013 loss. Shares climbed as China
economic data including exports and factory output boosted
confidence in the world’s second-biggest economy. Hong Kong’s
equity benchmark traded at 11.1 times estimated earnings,
compared with 15.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Fed Decision  Futures on the S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent today. The U.S.
equity gauge added 0.4 percent yesterday in New York, sending
the index toward a record, as Microsoft Corp. announced a $40
billion buyback and the Fed started its two-day meeting.  Analysts are divided on the amount by which the U.S.
central bank will scale back its monthly asset purchases today.
Among 64 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, 33 predict the
Fed will reduce its buying of Treasuries by $5 billion or less,
with 31 forecasting a cut of $10 billion or more.  Tencent slumped 3.9 percent to HK$402.40, the second-biggest drop on the Hang Seng Index. The company’s market value
this week surpassed $100 billion as the stock extended record
highs this month. Shares traded at 37.5 times estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with its five-year average of 29.3.  Bank of East Asia Ltd.  today fell the most on the
benchmark. Shares dropped 4.5 percent to HK$32.05 after climbing
yesterday along with other family-run lenders after Wing Hang
Bank Ltd. said shareholders were approached in a takeover bid.  Prada Falls  Prada (1913)  slid 1.4 percent to HK$78.50. First-half net income
rose 7.6 percent to 308.2 million euros ($412 million), missing
the 321 million-euro average of five estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The luxury brand said the euro’s strength will weigh
more heavily on earnings than some analysts anticipate.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813) , a mainland developer
controlled by billionaire Hui Wing Mau, slumped 2.4 percent to
HK$18.60. Guangzhou R&F Properties Co., a builder in the
southern Chinese city, sank 1.4 percent to HK$12.62. Both
climbed at least 1.9 percent in the previous two days.  “When share prices are too high, it gives an excuse to
correct,” said KGI’s Kwong.  Mainland developers dropped even after data today showed
new home prices in the nation’s four major cities rose the most
last month since January 2011, led by Guangzhou. Prices climbed
in 69 of 70 cities the government tracked last month from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement.  Rate Pressure  While Chinese developers sank, their Hong Kong counterparts
rose. Expectation for a moderate tapering of Fed bond purchases
eases pressure on the city’s interest rates, which track the
U.S., Kwong said. Builders accounted for at least half of the
 top 10 gains  on the Hang Seng Index.  Cheung Kong climbed 3.1 percent to HK$120. The company’s
risk-reward profile has become more attractive, CLSA analyst
Jonathan Galligan wrote in a report dated yesterday, reiterating
his buy rating on the stock.  New World Development Co. (17) , a builder controlled by
billionaire Cheng Yu-tung, gained 2.6 percent to HK$11.98.
Henderson Land Development Co. rose 1.2 percent to HK$47.65.  Solar shares gained after the Ministry of Industry said it
will ban construction of plants built solely to boost capacity.
 GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , the world’s biggest producer of
polysilicon for solar panels, climbed 1.4 percent to HK$2.12.
 Hanergy Solar Group Ltd. (566) , a Beijing-based renewable-energy
producer, jumped 5.8 percent to 91 Hong Kong cents.  A global oversupply of solar panels, of which China is the
biggest producer, led to a 20 percent plunge in  prices  last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chinese
authorities have pledged to cut overcapacity in industries from
steel to paper as policy makers seek to reduce the economy’s
reliance on investments and exports.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index were little changed at
23,200. The HSI Volatility Index rose 0.8 percent to 17.41,
indicating traders expect the benchmark equity index to swing 5
percent in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
