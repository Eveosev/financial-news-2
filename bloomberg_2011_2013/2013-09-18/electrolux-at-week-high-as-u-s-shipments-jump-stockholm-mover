Electrolux AB (ELUXB) , the world’s second-largest maker of home appliances, rose to its highest price in
almost a week in Stockholm trading after U.S. shipments of
washers and ovens surged last month.  Electrolux, the maker of Frigidaire freezers and AEG vacuum
cleaners, advanced as much as 1.2 percent to 179.6 kronor,
making it the second-biggest gainer on the OMX Stockholm 30
index. The shares gained 1 percent at 179.2 kronor as of 10:04
a.m. Swedish time, with trading volume at 40 percent of the
daily average in the past three months.  U.S. August deliveries of products such as dishwashers,
dryers, freezers and ranges rose an annual 15 percent, reaching
3.28 million units, the Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers said yesterday. Electrolux forecast in July that
demand in the U.S. could increase by as much as 7 percent this
year.  North America  accounted for 30 percent of the Swedish
company’s revenue during the first six months of the year.  “The North American market continues to perform very
strongly for Electrolux, however, other geographical areas,
especially  Europe  and now  Brazil , suffer from weak demand,”
Fredrik Nilhov, an analyst at Swedbank AB in Stockholm, wrote in
a note to clients today. Nilhov has a reduce rating on
Electrolux shares, whose valuation is “stressed,” he said.  Of the 27 analysts that cover Electrolux and share their
ratings with Bloomberg, 48 percent advise clients to  buy the
shares  while 33 percent have hold ratings and 19 percent have
sell recommendations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
