With Emirates Team New Zealand on
the brink of capturing the America’s Cup, the second of today’s
two races on San Francisco Bay was postponed until tomorrow
because of strong wind.  The Kiwis won the first of today’s races by 15 seconds over
Oracle Team USA, taking an 8-1 lead in the series and moving one
win from the nine needed to capture the 162-year-old sailing
trophy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
