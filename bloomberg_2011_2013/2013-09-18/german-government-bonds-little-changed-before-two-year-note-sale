Germany  led declines among Europe’s
top-rated government bonds amid bets the Federal Reserve will
refrain from an aggressive stimulus cut, sapping demand for the
region’s safer assets.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds shrank to the
least in two years. Austrian, Dutch and Finnish securities fell
for a second day. The Federal Open Market Committee will reduce
Treasury purchases to $40 billion, while continuing to buy $40
billion of mortgage-backed bonds, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Spain plans
to sell 3 billion euros ($4 billion) of debt tomorrow.  “The Fed will try to be on the dovish side to avoid a
strong increase in yields,” said Allan von Mehren, chief
analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “We are getting back
to a normal world where investors are looking at where can we
get some return rather than just a preservation of capital? The
transition is ongoing and is going to put some more upward
pressure on bund yields.”  German 10-year yields increased four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.01 percent at 4:23 p.m. London time after
reaching 2.02 percent, the  most  since Sept. 13. The 2 percent
bund maturing in August 2023 fell 0.37, or 3.70 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.955.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spain’s 10-year
bonds instead of German bunds shrank four basis points to 240
basis points, after dropping to 239, the narrowest since July 5,
2011. The spread of Italian securities over bunds contracted
four basis points to 240 basis points, having dropped to 237,
the least since Aug. 23.  Fed Tapering  Among 64 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, 33 predict
the Fed will reduce its purchases of Treasuries by $5 billion or
less, with 31 forecasting a cut of $10 billion or more. The
central bank will announce its decision at the end of a two-day
meeting at 2 p.m. in  Washington .  Core government bonds also dropped after the minutes of the
Bank of England’s Sept. 3-4 policy meeting, showed that “no
member judged that further stimulus was appropriate at
present.” The Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0 to keep the
 bond-purchase program  at 375 billion pounds ($599 billion) and
the  benchmark interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent. U.K.
gilts fell, pushing the 10-year yield toward a two-year high.  “We’ve had a positive move in equity markets and BOE
minutes that were slightly more positive, not seeing a need for
more stimulus,” said Owen Callan, an analyst at Danske Bank A/S
in Dublin. “That’s pushing fixed income lower in the euro zone.
If we’re going to have no more stimulus from the BOE and
tapering from the Fed then that makes it more difficult for the
ECB to remain very dovish.”  Yields Climb  Yields on the Netherlands’ 10-year bonds increased four
basis points to 2.36 percent, while those on similar-maturity
Finnish securities climbed four basis points to 2.22 percent.
 Austria ’s 10-year yield added four basis points to 2.39 percent.  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Austria and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Germany’s two-year notes declined by the most in almost two
weeks as the nation sold 4.22 billion euros of the securities at
an auction. The rate climbed three basis points to 0.24 percent,
the biggest increase since Sept. 5, based on closing prices.  Treasuries Favored  Investors should favor Treasuries over German bonds because
the higher yield on the U.S. securities doesn’t reflect the
Fed’s commitment to keep interest rates near record lows while
the American debt will probably benefit from any upsurge in risk
aversion, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts.  “Across rates markets, Treasuries have normalized faster
and we argue that it has overshot fundamentals,”  George Goncalves , Guy Mandy and Jeffrey Young wrote in a note dated
yesterday. “The rise in risk premium since May provides more
evidence that tapering is priced in, while European risk premium
is currently low.”  Spain is due to auction securities due in 2016 and 2028
tomorrow. The nation last sold the three-year notes maturing in
July 2016 on Aug. 1 at an average yield of 2.636 percent.  France 
is scheduled to sell a combined 7.5 billion euros of debt due in
2015, 2016 and 2018 tomorrow, as well as 1.7 billion euros of
inflation-linked bonds.  German securities lost 2.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish
bonds earned 8.5 percent, while Italy’s returned 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
