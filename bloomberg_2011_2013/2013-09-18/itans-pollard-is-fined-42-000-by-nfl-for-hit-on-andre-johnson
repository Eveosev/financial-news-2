Tennessee Titans safety Bernard Pollard said the  National Football League  fined him $42,000 for
a hit to the head of Houston Texans receiver  Andre Johnson , who
suffered a concussion on the play.  Pollard struck Johnson in the helmet with his shoulder
while trying to prevent the receiver from making a 21-yard catch
in the closing minutes of the second half. No penalty was called
on the play, which helped set up the Texans’ tying touchdown in
their 30-24 overtime win on Sept. 15.  Pollard, who is second on the Titans with 13 tackles this
season, complained about the fine on Twitter.  “Wow! It’s called football but they want 2 hand touch,”
Pollard  wrote on Twitter .  The Titans host the San Diego Chargers this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
