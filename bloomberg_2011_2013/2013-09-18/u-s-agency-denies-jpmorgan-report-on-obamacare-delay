The health insurance marketplaces
created by the U.S. Affordable Care Act will open as scheduled
on Oct. 1, the Obama administration said, denying a report by a
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst who suggested there may be a delay.  The JPMorgan analyst, Justin Lake, said in a note to
clients that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may
delay the start of open enrollment on the health exchanges and
that “an announcement could come as soon as today.” A
spokesman for the Medicare agency, Brian Cook, called Lake’s
report “totally false.”  “Open enrollment in the health insurance marketplace will
begin on Oct. 1,” Cook said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
