The cost of insuring the debt of
Wind Acquisition Finance SA, a unit of Italian mobile provider
Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA, fell for a third day to the lowest
level since June 2011.  Credit-default swaps on Wind dropped as much as 23.5 basis
points today to 423 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The swaps are down from 508 basis points Sept. 13 and
the equivalent of 1,680 basis points in July 2012.  The companyâ€™s 11.75 percent bonds maturing in July 2017
were quoted at 106.5 cents on the euro, the highest since July
24, at 2:40 p.m. in  London , up from 101.8 cents in June.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
