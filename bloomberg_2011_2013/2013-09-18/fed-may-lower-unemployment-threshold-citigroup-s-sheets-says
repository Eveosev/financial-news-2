The U.S. Federal Reserve today will
announce a lowering of its unemployment threshold for ending
accommodative policy, said Nathan Sheets, global head of
international economics at  Citigroup Inc. (C)   The Fed has been “banking on an accelerating economy” and
will now have to “fuzz up its threshold for hiking” to an
unemployment rate of 6 percent, Sheets said in a radio interview
today on Bloomberg Surveillance with  Tom Keene  and Michael
McKee.  Sheets, former head of the Fed’s international-finance
division, said the central bank’s asset purchase program “is on
a trajectory to $4 trillion” and its balance sheet won’t
normalize until 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
