Gunmen in northern  Afghanistan 
killed a provincial election official two days after
registration officially opened for a vote next year that will
occur as U.S.-led forces leave the war-torn country.  Mohammad Aman, head of the election commission in Kunduz
province bordering Tajikistan, was shot in the chest by
unidentified assailants who were riding a motorcycle, according
to Ebadullah Talwar, the area’s deputy police chief. Aman had
been collecting rents from shop owners in a market at the time,
Talwar said.  While no group immediately claimed responsibility, the
Taliban has vowed to disrupt and attack any officials working
with the  Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan . The
registration process for April 5 presidential and provincial
elections opened two days ago and runs through Oct. 6.  The attack is “a major blow in disrupting the Afghan
election process and is a major threat for local people to go to
vote,” Jawid Kohistani, leader of a political party affiliated
with the opposition that has no seats in parliament, said by
phone.  Kunduz was one of the last remaining Taliban strongholds in
the region to fall in the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan after the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
A suicide bomb in the province last month killed 12 people,
including a district governor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
