Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s physical
commodities unit is a “core” business that provides a crucial
service to clients, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
said today.  “The role we play in that business is very, very important
to users in the market,” Blankfein, 58, said in an interview
with CNBC. “Without us in that market, a good credit, a
regulated company, the outcomes won’t be very good for the users
of the market.”  U.S. lawmakers have questioned whether banks should be
allowed to own physical commodities businesses and the  Federal
Reserve  said it’s reviewing a decision it made a decade ago that
allowed commercial banks to enter the industry.  Goldman Sachs hasn’t been pressured by regulators to exit
its physical commodities units, Blankfein said. The New York-based firm is in a different position than some commercial banks
because Goldman Sachs was already in the commodities business
when it became a  bank holding company  and didn’t need approval
from regulators later on, he said.  Blankfein worked in the firm’s J. Aron commodities unit,
which also produced Chief Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz
and President Gary D. Cohn.  “That is a core, strategic business for us,” Blankfein
said. “Commodity hedging is no different to people who have
risks in the commodities markets -- which are real, iconic
American companies -- as their credit risk or interest-rate
risk. And we provide that service.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
