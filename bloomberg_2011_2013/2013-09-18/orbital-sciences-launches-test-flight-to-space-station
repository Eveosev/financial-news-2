An  Orbital Sciences Corp. (ORB)  rocket
lifted off today in an attempt to send an unmanned commercial
craft to the International Space Station.  The company’s new Antares rocket launched at 10:58 a.m.
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Wallops
Flight Facility on Virginia’s Eastern Shore. The liftoff had
been postponed a day because bad weather on Sept. 13 delayed the
rocket’s transport to the launch pad.  The mission is the final test before Dulles, Virginia-based
Orbital can make regular cargo deliveries under a $1.9 billion
contract with  NASA .  Closely held Space Exploration Technologies Corp.,
controlled by billionaire Elon Musk, last year became the first
company to berth a private supply ship with the station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
