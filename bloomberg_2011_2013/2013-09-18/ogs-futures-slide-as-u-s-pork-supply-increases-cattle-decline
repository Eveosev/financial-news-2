Hog futures fell for a second day
on signs of rising U.S. pork supplies and slowing demand. Cattle
prices fell.  Meatpackers in  Iowa  and southern  Minnesota  slaughtered
404,000 hogs in the week ended Sept. 14, up 6.3 percent from a
week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Wholesale-pork prices are down 13 percent from a record on June
26, and domestic production of the meat will jump 3.2 percent
next year to 24.152 billion pounds (10.96 million metric tons),
the government estimates.  “Pork production is up,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines , Iowa, said in a telephone
interview. “The slaughter is going to pick up.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.1 percent to
87.425 cents a pound at 11:38 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices have dropped since reaching a contract high of
88.5 cents on Sept. 16.  Cattle futures for December delivery slid 0.1 percent to
$1.28525 a pound on the CME, down for a second day. Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement were up 0.1 percent at
$1.57975 a pound, after fluctuating between gains and losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
