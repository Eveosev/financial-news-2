Federal Reserve projections for
where the federal funds rate will be in 2016 are a central piece
of information being released in conjunction with the policy-maker meeting ending today, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief
economist  Jan Hatzius .  “That is the first time that FOMC participants are going
to be telling us where they see monetary policy that far out in
the future,” Hatzius said of the Federal Open Market
Committee’s two-day session on Bloomberg Television’s Market
Makers with  Stephanie Ruhle  and  Erik Schatzker . “Our
expectation is that most of the participants will project
something in the low two’s, but I think there will be a
significant impact from whatever they do.”  Fed policy makers will also probably decide today whether
to taper $85 billion in monthly bond buying at their meeting in
Washington, dialing down monthly Treasury purchases by $5
billion to $40 billion while maintaining mortgage-backed
securities purchases at $40 billion, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  “No tapering would definitely be a surprise,” Hatzius
said. “Investors are very much on board with the idea that you
get some tapering.”  The Fed will also release its economic forecasts today, and
Hatzius said “it is pretty clear that 2013 growth numbers are
going to have to come down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
