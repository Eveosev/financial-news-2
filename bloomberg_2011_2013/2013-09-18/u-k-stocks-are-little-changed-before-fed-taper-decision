U.K. stocks were little changed,
after the benchmark FTSE 100 Index fell the most this month, as
investors awaited the  Federal Reserve ’s decision on whether it
will start reducing the size of monthly bond purchases.  The FTSE 100 advanced 2.79 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 6,572.96 at 8:36 a.m. in London. The equity
benchmark has declined 3.9 percent from a 13-year high on May 22
amid concern the Fed will start to taper stimulus measures this
year. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also gained less than 0.1
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.1 percent.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will end a two-day policy
meeting today, at which officials will decide to reduce its $85
billion in monthly bond purchases, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
