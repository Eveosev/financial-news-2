Libya may offer areas containing
natural gas in an auction of energy-exploration rights it plans
next year as it seeks to boost production of the fuel amid
rising electricity use, National Oil Corp. executives said.  “It is possible that the bidding round could include
gas,” Mansour Emtir, petrochemical and gas superintendent of
the state-run NOC, said in an interview today at a conference in
Tripoli. “We need more gas for our power plants and for
petrochemical projects” that burn the fuel as feedstock.  Libya’s gas reserves are “largely unexploited and
unexplored,” NOC Gas Committee Chairman Jamal Hawisa told the
conference. The North African country may contain 100 trillion
cubic feet of gas, almost double its 54 trillion cubic feet in
proven reserve, he said. “Recent studies indicate large gas
reserves in western Libya,” he said. “They are now under
appraisal.”  NOC Chairman Nuri Berruien said yesterday that Libya plans
to hold a bidding round for petroleum exploration rights in mid-2014. It would be the first such auction since the overthrow of
Muammar Qaddafi two years ago.  Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, has the largest oil reserves in  Africa . Electricity
consumption in the country is growing by 7 percent a year,
according to the electricity ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
