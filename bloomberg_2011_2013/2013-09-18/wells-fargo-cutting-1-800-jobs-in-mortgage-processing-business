Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S.
mortgage lender, is eliminating about 1,800 more jobs in its
home-loan production business as rising mortgage rates curtail
borrowers’ demand for refinancing.  The reductions are in addition to 3,000 earlier this
quarter, Tom Goyda, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based
bank, said in an interview yesterday. Those included 2,300
announced Aug. 21 and smaller cuts prior to that, Goyda said.  Wells Fargo is cutting jobs as higher borrowing costs slow
refinancings and new home purchases fail to compensate for the
decline. The bank may originate about $80 billion in home loans
in the third quarter, a 29 percent drop from the three months
that ended June 30, Chief Financial Officer Timothy Sloan said
Sept. 9.  Wells Fargo was the biggest employer among U.S. banks at
midyear with about 274,000 people. The workers whose positions
are being cut received 60 days’ notice, Goyda said.  Mortgages typically are divided into those for refinancing
existing loans and those for home purchases. While refis are
mainly tied to the level of  interest rates , purchase mortgages
are tied to home-sale activity.  Borrowing rates  climbed  in recent months amid speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  would scale back its $85 billion-a-month in purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed
securities. The central bank yesterday said it will continue the
purchases, saying it needs more evidence of lasting improvement
in the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
