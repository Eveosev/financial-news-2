Brazil ’s real gained amid
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will decide to maintain
most of the stimulus that has buoyed emerging-market assets,
bolstering central bank efforts to strengthen the currency.  The real rose 0.2 percent to 2.2523 per dollar at 9:48 a.m.
in Sao Paulo after gaining 1.3 percent yesterday, the biggest
jump since Sept. 9. Swap rates on the contract due in January
2017 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 11.63
percent.  Fed policy makers meeting today will probably lower the
monthly pace of bond purchases by $10 billion, to $75 billion,
according to the median response of 34 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey on Sept. 6. That’s down from expectations
of a $20 billion reduction in a July survey. The real has
appreciated 8.4 percent since Aug. 22, when Brazil’s central
bank announced a $60 billion intervention program of currency
swaps and foreign-exchange credit lines through December.  “Some people in the market think the Fed won’t do anything
to reduce stimulus,” said Jose Carlos Amado, a currency trader
at Renascenca Corretora in  Sao Paulo . “Even if the Fed does do
something, the real may fall, but it’s not going to plunge.”  The central bank sold $497 million of foreign-exchange
swaps today and plans to roll over up to 55,300 foreign-exchange
swap contracts at 10:30 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
