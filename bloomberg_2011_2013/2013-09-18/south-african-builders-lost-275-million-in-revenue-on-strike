South African construction
companies lost about 2.7 billion rand ($275 million) in revenue
after workers downed tools for three weeks seeking higher wage
increases, according to the builders’ federation.  “The strike took place under a no-work, no-pay
agreement,” Norman Milne, president of the South African
Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, said in an e-mailed
response to queries today. “Contractors would still have to pay
for construction plants and equipment that stood idle on site,
plus their staff and workforce who were not on strike.”  About 90,000 builders, led by the National Union of
Mineworkers, ended a three-week strike on Sept. 13, after
accepting a wage increase of as much as 12 percent as part of a
two-year agreement. The deal will add 3 percent, or 150 million
rand, to the industry’s wage bill this year, according to Milne.  “It will not impact current project costs,” Milne said.
“Our members have no option, but to price these increases into
future bids and pass these costs on.”  Inflation in  Africa ’s biggest economy accelerated to 6.4
percent in August, breaching the central bank’s upper limit. The
economy is forecast to expand 2 percent this year, the slowest
pace since a recession in 2009.  The 7-member FTSE/JSE Africa Construction & Building
Materials Index fell for the first time in three days,  declining 
as much as 1.6 percent.  Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR)  and  Aveng
Ltd. (AEG)  are the country’s biggest construction companies by market
value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
