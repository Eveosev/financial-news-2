BP Plc (BP/)  sold a cargo of  North Sea 
Forties crude for immediate loading at the lowest level in more
than two months. Petraco SpA failed to buy Russian Urals blend
in Northwest Europe.  Russia plans to reduce crude shipments by 15 percent in the
fourth quarter compared with this quarter, according to an
Energy Ministry schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought Forties F0905 for Sept. 28 to
Sept. 30 loading from BP at 7 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with
previous trades at plus 65 cents and $1.09 a barrel on Sept. 10,
and is the cheapest since June 27. The cargo was initially
scheduled to load Sept. 10 to Sept. 12, according to a loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  BP failed to sell Forties for Oct. 7 to Oct. 9 at a premium
of 79 cents to the benchmark, while Trafigura Beheer BV was
looking to buy an Oct. 10 to Oct. 15 cargo of the same grade at
60 cents more than Dated Brent.  Brent for November settlement traded at $108.85 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $108.37 from the previous session. The December
contract was at $107.95, a discount of 90 cents to November.  BP forecasts Forties output will increase in the fourth
quarter, the company said on its website. Production is
estimated at 408,900 barrels a day this month, 463,300 barrels
in October, 471,700 barrels in November and 478,600 barrels in
December.  No shipments of Flotta crude are scheduled to load in
October compared with one 600,000 barrel cargo due on Sept. 23,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Urals/Mediterranean  Petraco didn’t manage to buy 100,000 metric tons of Urals
at 85 cents a barrel below Dated Brent for Oct. 9 to Oct. 13
loading at the Baltic ports of either Primorsk or Ust-Luga, the
survey showed. The grade last traded in the window on Sept. 12
at a discount of $1.10.  Exports of Russian crude will be 48.52 million tons, or
about 3.87 million barrels a day in the last quarter of 2013.
That compares with 57.27 million tons in the third quarter,
according to a previous schedule.  OAO Surgutneftegas offered 100,000 tons for loading from
Ust-Luga on the  Baltic Sea  in a tender, according to two people
who participate in the market, asking not to be identified
because the information is confidential.  Hellenic Petroleum SA issued a tender to buy 80,000 tons of
Urals for Oct. 6 to Oct. 10 delivery to  Greece , according to two
people who participate in the market, asking not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The tender
closes tomorrow.  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS is seeking to buy
80,000 to 140,000 tons of Urals for Oct. 5 to Oct. 15 delivery,
according to two people who participate in the market, asking
not to be identified because the information is confidential.
The tender closes tomorrow.  Libya ’s National Oil Corp. issued a tender to sell 1.2
million barrels of crude from the Waha field via the Mellitah
terminal in end-September, two traders who received the notice
said, asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The tender closes tomorrow at 3pm local time.  Pumping of Iraqi crude to Ceyhan is still halted because of
a leakage. Repairs will take about two days, according to port
agent Boutros Maritime & Transport SA. About 350,000 barrels of
crude are available for loading, the port agent said in an e-mailed report.  West Africa  BP offered 600,000 barrels of Qua Iboe at either $5.50 more
than Dated Brent for Oct. 2 to Oct. 8 delivery to Rotterdam, or
$5.35 to Lavera in  France  on the Dilong Spirit crude carrier,
according to the survey. That is 20 cents and 15 cents lower,
respectively, than its offer on Monday.  Taiwan’s state-owned refiner CPC Corp. is seeking to buy
1.9 million barrels of November-loading, low-sulfur crude from

Oct. 29 to Oct. 30 loading in a tender from Eni SpA, according
to three people who participate in the market. Tupras is not a
regular buyer of West African crude and the purchase is probably
a result of recent supply disruptions from Libya, two of the
people said.  Indian Oil Corp. bought 1 million barrels each of Qua Iboe
and EA grades for Nov. 1 to Nov. 15 loading, said two traders
who participate in the market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
