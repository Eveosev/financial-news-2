Manchester United Plc (MANU)  said its
fourth-quarter loss narrowed as the soccer team earned more from
sponsorship on the way to a record-extending 20th English league
title. Annual revenue rose 13 percent to a record 363.2 million
pounds ($580 million).  The net loss was 2.7 million pounds, or 2 pence per share,
for the three months to June 30, after a 10.6 million-pound
loss, or 7 pence a share, in the year-earlier period, the
company said in a statement. Net income before adjustments,
which included tax charges from before last year’s initial
public offering, was 106 million pounds, compared with a 14.9
million-pound loss.  Revenue rose 14 percent in the quarter to 85.1 million
pounds as United continued a “scalpel not a spade approach” to
mining territories for sponsors, Executive Vice-Chairman Ed Woodward said in a conference call with analysts.  “Our commercial business continues to be a very powerful
engine of growth, enabling the team to continue to be
successful,” Woodward said in a statement.  Sponsorship sales rose 49 percent for the quarter to 21.3
million pounds. Retail and licensing sales increased by 22
percent to 10.5 million pounds, and so-called matchday revenue
increased by 9 percent compared with the year-earlier period
when United finished the season without a trophy for the first
time since 2005.  In the quarter, United signed sponsorship agreements with
the Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam and Japanese
mobile-game designer Gloops Inc.  Nike Deal  United, which is in talks about improving its agreement
with apparel supplier  Nike Inc. (NKE) , expects revenue to be between
420 million pounds and 430 million pounds for fiscal 2014, based
on finishing third in the Premier League and reaching the
 Champions League  and domestic Cup quarterfinals.  United, which raised $233 million in the August 2012 IPO in
the U.S., doesn’t have any immediate plans for further share
sales, Woodward said, after United made a so-called “shelf”
filing that says it may seek to raise $400 million at some point
in the future.  United shares were up 0.7 percent at $17.23 at 10:32 a.m.
in  New York .  Gross debt at United, which was bought in a leveraged
takeover by the U.S.-based Glazer family in 2005, declined 11
percent to 389.2 million pounds over the year. Adjusted annual
net income was 17.2 million pounds, up from 4.5 million.  Champions League  United coach  David Moyes ’s team had a 4-2 home win over
 Bayer Leverkusen  in its opening game of the Champions League
yesterday, and is fifth in the Premier League with seven points
from four games, three behind leader Liverpool. Moyes replaced
 Alex Ferguson , who retired in May having led the club to 38
trophies in 26 years.  Under Moyes, United signed Everton midfielder Marouane
Fellaini and defender Guillermo Varela from Penarol in the
offseason, adding fewer recruits than Premier League competitors
such as  Manchester City  and Chelsea. United rejected offers from
Chelsea for striker  Wayne Rooney .  United has “not just a strong but a deep squad,”
Woodward, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker, told analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
