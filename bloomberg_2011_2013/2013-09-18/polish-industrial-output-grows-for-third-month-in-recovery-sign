Polish  industrial output  increased
for a third month in August in a sign that the recovery in the
European Union’s largest economy is gathering pace.  Production rose 2.2 percent from a year earlier after
increasing 6.3 percent in July, the  Central Statistical Office 
in Warsaw said today. That’s less than the 2.7 percent median
estimate in a  Bloomberg survey  of 32 economists. Output declined
4.5 percent from the previous month.  Growth in the $490 billion economy accelerated in the
second quarter to 0.8 percent as the euro area, the destination
for 51 percent of Polish exports, emerged from its longest
recession on record. Manufacturing expanded the most since July
2011 last month as new orders soared, HSBC Holdings Plc. said
Sept. 2 in its purchasing managers survey.  “Leading indicators for manufacturing are showing that
there is potential for significant acceleration of growth in
coming months,”  Rafal Benecki , chief economist for  Poland  at
ING Groep NV, said by e-mail before the figures were released.  The zloty traded at 4.2320 per euro at 3:41 p.m. in Warsaw,
0.5 percent lower than yesterday. The yield on two-year
government zloty debt rose 1 basis point to 3.09 percent.  In a separate report, the office said producer prices
dropped 1.1 percent from a year earlier in August, more than the
0.7 percent median contraction predicted by 26 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg. Prices declined 0.3 percent from July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
