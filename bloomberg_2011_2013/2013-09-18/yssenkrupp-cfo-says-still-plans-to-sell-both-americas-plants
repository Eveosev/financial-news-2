ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , Germany’s largest
steelmaker, still plans to sell both of the plants in its Steel
Americas unit, Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff said.  Essen-based ThyssenKrupp is “confident” it will dispose
of the unit, Kerkhoff told reporters today in  Frankfurt . The
company isn’t currently preparing a capital increase, he said.  The producer has been seeking to sell the Americas unit for
16 months to expand its non-steel operations and weather a drop
in demand. Lower use in the auto and construction industries and
higher competition from China has reduced steel prices, leading
German peer  Salzgitter AG (SZG)  to announce 1,500 job cuts last month.  ThyssenKrupp advanced 1.9 percent to 17.205 euros, the
highest since July 25, by the close of trading in Frankfurt.  The company may hold onto its plant in Brazil and sell only
the U.S. operation from the Americas unit, two people briefed on
discussions said last week, declining to be identified.  While Germany’s largest steelmaker previously planned to
sign a deal before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, Chief
Executive Officer  Heinrich Hiesinger  said in an Aug. 13 earnings
statement that ThyssenKrupp won’t rely on reporting deadlines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
