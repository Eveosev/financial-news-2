Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , the Frankfurt-based lender that’s adding bankers for the ultra-wealthy, hired
three advisers from  Bank of America Corp.  for affluent
individuals and families in the U.S.  Michael Dawson , 67, Stephan Farber, 41, and Stephen
Cordill, 57, will join the German bank’s Houston office after
overseeing more than $1 billion for clients of Bank of America’s
Merrill Lynch business, Deutsche Bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. Before joining Bank of America, Dawson spent
more than 30 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., while Farber had
worked for  UBS AG. (UBSN)   “Texas is an extremely important region for us, with
continued wealth creation as a result of innovation and
outstanding ingenuity, particularly in the energy sector,” Haig Ariyan, co-head of wealth management for the Americas, said in
the statement. “This team is highly regarded.”  Deutsche Bank is seeking to add wealthy clients to compete
with larger rivals such as UBS and Credit Suisse Group AG of
 Switzerland . Deutsche Bank was the eighth-biggest wealth manager
globally last year, with $387.3 billion of managed assets,
according to Scorpio Partnership, a London-based research
company. UBS topped the ranking with more than $1.7 trillion of
client funds. Swiss or American firms accounted for 13 of the
top 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
