Denver Broncos All-Pro left tackle
Ryan Clady will miss the rest of the season because of a foot
injury, leaving quarterback  Peyton Manning  without his most
important pass protector on the offensive line.  The 6-foot-6, 315-pound Clady was placed on season-ending
injured reserve after being diagnosed with a Lisfranc joint tear
through the arch of his left foot that will require surgery, the
team said in an e-mailed statement.  Clady signed a five-year contract with the Broncos in July
that NFL.com said is worth $57.5 million. He’d started every
game for Denver since being selected in the first round of the
2008 National Football League draft.  At left tackle, Clady is responsible for protecting the
right-handed Manning’s back, or blind side, from defenders when
he drops back to pass. Clady allowed one quarterback sack last
year, when he was selected to the  Pro Bowl  for the third time.  Clady will be replaced by  Chris Clark , a former undrafted
free agent who has made six starts -- all at tight end -- over
the past four seasons with the Broncos. Denver also said today
it signed free-agent tackle Winston Justice, a second-round
draft pick in 2006.  Denver, which has scored an NFL-high 90 points in winning
its first two games, hosts the  Oakland Raiders  on Sept. 23. The
Broncos already were playing without centers Dan Koppen and J.D.
Walton because of season-long injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
