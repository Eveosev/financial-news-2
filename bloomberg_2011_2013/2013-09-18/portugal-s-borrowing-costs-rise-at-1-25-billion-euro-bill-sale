Portugal ’s borrowing costs
increased to the highest since November as the government sold
750 million euros ($1 billion) of 18-month bills.  The securities due in March 2015 were issued at an average
yield of 2.293 percent, the country’s debt management agency
said. That compares with an rate of 1.603 percent at a previous
auction of 18-month bills on June 19 and is the highest since
Nov. 21, when it sold the securities at a yield of 2.99 percent.
Today’s auction attracted bids for 2 times the amount offered,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.1 in June.  Portugal’s  10-year (GSPT10YR)  yield breached 8 percent for the first
time in eight months on July 3 when a rift in the ruling
coalition emerged. Portuguese Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho 
later that month pushed ahead with a government reshuffle and
pledged to complete a bailout program that includes new spending
cuts.  The country sold 10-year debt in May for the first time in
more than two years as it seeks to regain full access to debt
markets after requesting the bailout from the European Union and
the  International Monetary Fund  in 2011 following a surge in
debt levels and borrowing costs. The country pays 3.2 percent on
its bailout loans.  The  two-year  note yield fell 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 5.55 percent at 12:39 p.m. London time.
Ten-year bond yields slipped three basis points to 7.13 percent.  The debt agency today also sold 500 million euros of three-month bills due in December 2013 at an average yield of 1.081
percent, attracting bids for 1.8 times the amount offered. That
compares with an average yield of 0.766 percent at a previous
auction of three-month bills on Aug. 21, with a bid-to-cover
ratio of 3.4.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, on Sept. 13 said
that the total indicative amount for today’s auctions was
between 1 billion euros and 1.25 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
