U.S. Customs  and Border Protection
staffing shortages are leaving arriving international travelers
standing in line for nearly five hours at the busiest airports,
according to a travel industry report.  Peak wait times reached a high of 4.5 hours at  New York ’s
 John F. Kennedy International Airport  in December 2012. At Miami
in April 2013, the peak wait times were 4.7 hours.  News of these lines may make overseas visitors who could
spend as much as $95 billion during the next five years think
twice about coming, said Roger Dow, president and chief
executive officer of the U.S. Travel Association, a Washington-based group representing hotels, rental-car companies, and local
convention and visitor bureaus.  “Far too many of these valued customers spent the first
hours of their trip waiting in line at U.S. air ports of
entry,” Dow said in a statement. “Long lines and wait times
that many experience during entry are deterring millions of
potential visitors.”  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  Chief Executive Officer  Richard Anderson  in July called customs delays in New York, Los Angeles
and  Chicago  an “embarrassment” compared with comparable cities
in Europe, China or  Japan .  Delta, which earned 43 percent of its second-quarter
mainline passenger revenue on international flights, recently
opened a $1.4 billion terminal at John F. Kennedy International
Airport in New York, in part to improve the experience for
foreign travelers.  Customs officials have blamed the lines on automatic cuts
to the agency’s budget.  Sequester Blamed  The longest peak wait times at three other major
international airports, according to agency data analyzed by the
travel group, were 3.8 hours at Chicago O’Hare in November 2012,
3.3 hours at  Los Angeles  International Airport in March 2013,
and 2.9 hours at Washington Dulles International Airport in
April 2013.  U.S. Travel said it analyzed limited, nonpublic information
provided by Customs on average and peak wait times from June
2012 through May 2013. Average wait times were often less than
30 minutes. The longest ranged from 90 minutes to more than four
hours, the group said.  There were 213.1 million long-haul international travelers
arriving in the U.S. in 2010, up from 151.7 million in 2000,
according to the study. The number is expected to reach 320.8
million in 2020.  Customs needs 3,500 more officers to fill empty lanes and
reduce peak wait times by 50 percent, the group said.  Former Homeland Security Secretary  Janet Napolitano  warned
earlier this year that budget cuts would reduce overtime and
cause delays at international airports.  The U.S. travel industry grew 7.8 percent in 2012 and
foreign-visitor revenue represents 12 percent of U.S. export
growth, according to the  travel association .  Customs delays were cited in a March study by U.S. Travel
as putting $95 billion of economic activity and 518,900 jobs at
risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
