Qatar’s sovereign-wealth fund will
begin clearing a luxury-homes site at  Chelsea Barracks  in
November, more than five years after buying the London property.  Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co.’s Project Blue
(Guernsey) affiliate will demolish towers and a warehouse and
drive piles into the ground on the edge of the site, according
to a letter sent to local residents obtained by  Bloomberg News .
The Chelsea Barracks Partnership, which liaises with local
residents, said in the letter dated Sept. 9 that the work would
start in early November.  A joint venture paid 959 million pounds for the 5.3 hectare
(13-acre) site in January 2008 and Qatari Diar later took full
control of the project. Project Blue won initial  local-government approval  two years ago to develop nearly 450 homes,
stores, a health center and leisure facilities on the land.  The developer still needs to gain final permission from
Westminster borough council for the detailed design of the
buildings and Project Blue plans to carry out related
consultations “in due course,” according to the letter.  The developer wasn’t immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
