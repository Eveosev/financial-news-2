Lesotho  Prime Minister Tom Thabane
has reassured the government’s main coalition partner that the
Highlands Water Project is controlled by a committee of
ministers headed by them, and not his office.  In an official speech on state-owned Lesotho Television
last night, Thabane said the committee is headed by Water
Affairs Minister Tim Thahane, who is a member of the Lesotho
Congress for Democracy, or LCD, the second-biggest party in the
coalition government.  The LCD threatened to withdraw from the 12 billion-rand
($1.3 billion) project, which will supply  South Africa  with
water and hydroelectric power to Lesotho, after the Lesotho
People’s Congress party said Thabane took control of the project
following allegations that Thahane was under investigation for
human trafficking. Thahane denies the allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
