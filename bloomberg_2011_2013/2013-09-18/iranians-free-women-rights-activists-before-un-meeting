Iranian authorities freed eight
female human-rights advocates, including lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh,
just days before  Iran ’s new President Hassan Rohani heads to New
York for the United Nations General Assembly.  Sotoudeh, 50, was serving a six-year sentence after being
arrested in September 2010 and jailed on charges of harming
national security. She went on a 49-day hunger strike last year.  “I do not know why I got released, I didn’t ask or plea
for my freedom,” Sotoudeh, who was surrounded by friends and
family at her Tehran home, said in an interview. “If this new
approach continues, then I can say, Rohani is sending a massage
to the world and he is interacting, first with his own people
and then with the rest of the world.”  The semi-official Fars news agency and opposition websites,
such as Kalame, reported the release of at least 11 prisoners
who had been held on security charges following Iran’s disputed
2009 election. The list included Mohsen Aminzadeh, deputy
foreign minister during the administration of President Mohammad Khatami.  The New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights
in Iran called on Rohani to improve the urgent human rights
situation in the country as he prepares to the address the UN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
