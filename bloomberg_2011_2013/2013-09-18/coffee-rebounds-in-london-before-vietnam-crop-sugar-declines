Robusta coffee rebounded in London
after prices yesterday slid to the lowest in almost three years.
Cocoa gained and sugar declined.  Robusta coffee futures dropped yesterday to the lowest
since October 2010 and arabica fell to the lowest since July
2009 after data from the New York-based Green Coffee Association
showed  inventory  of unroasted robusta and arabica beans in the
U.S. rose last month to the highest since July 2009. While the
first red cherries from the next crop in Vietnam have already
been picked by farmers, the majority of the new crop “will only
come from December,” Amsterdam-based trader Nedcoffee BV said
in a monthly report e-mailed yesterday.  “Robusta finally gave up the ghost as aggressive selling
into the November contract and negative GCA data for arabica
sent robusta plummeting,” broker BGC Partners LLC in London
said in a report e-mailed today. “Plentiful amounts of coffee
will limit the upside potential of arabica in the near term.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in November advanced 0.2
percent to $1,684 a metric ton by 11:25 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
 London . The price touched $1,660 a ton yesterday, the lowest
intraday price for a most-active contract since Oct. 12, 2010.
Arabica coffee for December delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$1.1505 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Futures trading
volume in New York was 39 percent lower than the average for the
past 100 days for this time of day, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  While arabica coffee fell 20 percent this year, the robusta
variety fared better, sliding 13 percent, as demand continues to
favor the cheaper variety, also used in espresso. Lower prices
prompted farmers in Vietnam to hold back beans. Growers were
still holding 9 percent of the 2012-13 crop as of Sept. 1,
according to Nedcoffee, which has offices in Ho Chi Minh City,
 Vietnam .  Vietnam Harvest  Vietnam will harvest a record 30 million bags of coffee in
the 2013-14 season, estimates Volcafe, the Winterthur,
Switzerland-based coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man
Holdings Ltd. Beans from the new crop are being offered for sale
at a discount of $30 a ton to the exchange price, while coffee
from the old crop is at a premium of $80 a ton to $100 a ton,
Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in
 Chicago  said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Cocoa for delivery in December climbed 0.2 percent to 1,709
pounds ($2,730) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for December delivery
gained 0.1 percent to $2,617 a ton on ICE.  White sugar for December delivery slid 0.3 percent to
$478.90 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in March fell
0.2 percent to 17.37 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
