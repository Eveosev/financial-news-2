Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.09 percent, within the
Federal Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.09 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.07 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-mailed statement.  No debt purchases are scheduled today by the Federal
Reserve. The Federal Open Market Committee today will probably
conclude a two-day meeting by dialing down monthly Treasury
purchases by $5 billion to $40 billion, while maintaining its
buying of mortgage-backed securities at $40 billion, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The FOMC has pledged
for more than a year to press on with bond buying until
achieving substantial labor market gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
