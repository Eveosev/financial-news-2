Canada  and the U.S. have discussed
working together on regulations to reduce  carbon emissions  in
their oil and gas industries, Canadian Natural Resources
Minister Joe Oliver said.  Jointly implementing greenhouse-gas rules for those
industries would “not necessarily” be the approach the two
countries would take, he said today in Calgary.  “We have talked to the U.S. administration about GHG
emissions,” Oliver said. “One of the subjects we’re looking at
is the development of conventional and unconventional
resources,” he said, referring to  oil sands  and so-called tight
oil reserves.  Canada has delayed implementing rules for the oil and
natural gas industry, the fastest-growing major sources of
emissions in the country. The federal government has said it’s
working with  Alberta , where most of Canada’s energy companies
are based, to develop regulations to help the nation of 34
million meet its Copenhagen Accord target of reducing
greenhouse-gas output by 17 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels.  Opponents of natural resource development projects use
“wildly distorted information to advance their cause,” Oliver
said in a speech. “We are engaged in a decisive battle for the
economic well-being of the country,” he added, warning of
“dire consequences” should major infrastructure projects fail
to proceed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
