New Zealand ’s economy is well
positioned to benefit from any drop in the Kiwi dollar which
would bolster the profitability of exporters, Finance Minister
 Bill English  said.  “The high 70s against the U.S. would be comfortable for
us,” English told Bloomberg Television in  Singapore . “Our
exporters have dealt with the headwind of a pretty high cross
rate over the last four or five years, in the mid 80s. They have
shown themselves to be resilient. What we need to see now though
is profitability in our export sector.”  English is betting that gradual reduction in stimulus by
Federal Reserve policy makers will raise U.S. interest rates and
help the kiwi decline, regardless of expectations that New
Zealand central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler will start to raise
borrowing costs next year. The currency has gained 2.9 percent
the past three months and bought 82.2 U.S. cents at 2 p.m. in
Wellington.  “A fair bit of that effect is priced in, and we look
forward to further positive developments as the  Federal Reserve 
continues to unwind,” English said. “We’re in a pretty good
position to benefit from any relaxation of pressure on the Kiwi
exchange rate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
