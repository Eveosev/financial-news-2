The borrowing and lending of
European bonds in the repurchase, or repo, market expanded this
year, even as U.S. trading contracted, the International Capital
Market Association said.  The value of European repo contracts outstanding as of June
12 was about 6.08 trillion euros ($8.12 trillion), up 8.6
percent from December, the ICMA said in an e-mailed report
today. The increase came as banks sought alternative funding
after repaying extraordinary loans granted by the  European
Central Bank  under its Longer-Term Refinancing Operations in
December 2011 and February 2012, and as higher money-market
rates lured lenders away from the ECB deposit facility, it said.  “This recovery in the European repo market is in marked
contrast to the contraction in the U.S. repo market,” the
Zurich-based ICMA said in a statement. “The LTRO repayments
have contributed to tighter market conditions and a steepening
money-market yield curve.”  The U.S. repurchase market shrunk to $4.6 trillion daily
outstanding in July, down 35 percent from a peak of $7.02
trillion in the first quarter of 2008, based on Federal Reserve
data compiled from its 21 primary dealers. In a repo, or
repurchase agreement, securities are exchanged for cash, with
the debt held as collateral for the loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
