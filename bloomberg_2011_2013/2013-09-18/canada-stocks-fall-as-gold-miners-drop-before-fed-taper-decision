Canadian  stocks  rose to the highest
in two years, as mining companies rallied after the U.S. Federal
Reserve unexpectedly refrained from reducing the pace of its
monthly bond buying.  Barrick Gold Corp. surged 8.6 percent as the metal jumped
the most since 2009. Athabasca Oil Corp. soared 4.7 percent
after oil extended a rally following the Fed decision. Catamaran
Corp. plummeted 9 percent to lead health-care companies lower.
BlackBerry Ltd. sank 2.2 percent after a report said the
smartphone maker may cut staff.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Index jumped 97.29 points, or 0.8
percent, to 12,931.40 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, erasing an earlier
decline of as much as 0.3 percent. The gauge has advanced 2.2
percent so far in September to close today at the highest level
since July 2011.  “There is a wash of money on the sidelines, so people will
be pushed into stocks as it goes higher and higher,”  Paul
Harris , partner and portfolio manager at Avenue Investment
Management in Toronto, said in a phone interview. He helps
oversee C$300 million ($294 million). “Gold and oil and the
metals going up will certainly help Canada. You’re seeing a
great rally.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his policy making
colleagues held back from paring record accommodation as rising
borrowing costs show signs of slowing the four-year U.S.
economic expansion. The stimulus has helped fuel a rally in
global stocks.  Materials Rally  Among 64 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News , 33
predicted officials would will reduce monthly buying of
Treasuries by $5 billion or less, with 31 forecasting a cut of
$10 billion or more.  Five of 10  main groups  in the benchmark Canadian equity
gauge advanced, led by a 5.1 percent rally among raw-materials
producers.  The S&P/TSX Materials Index erased an earlier decline of as
much as 1 percent as metals surged on the Fed decision. All ten
of the Canadian benchmark index’s top performers were miners of
precious metals.  Gold for immediate delivery rallied 4.1 percent for the
biggest gain since January 2009. Copper futures rose the most in
two weeks and silver surged 5.9 percent at 4:35 p.m.  Barrick Gold, the world’s largest gold producer, soared 8.6
percent to C$20.50, its biggest jump since 2008. Aurico Gold
Inc. rose 15 percent to C$4.54. Endeavor Silver Corp. jumped 15
percent to C$5.14.  Goldcorp Reversal  Goldcorp Inc. rose 7.5 percent to $29.11, erasing an
earlier loss after Chairman Ian Telfer reached a deal with
 Canada ’s main financial regulator to settle allegations that he
violated securities laws. The Ontario Securities Commission will
hold a hearing on Sept. 20 on whether to approve the settlement,
the OSC said yesterday in a statement.  Energy producers gained 0.5 percent as crude advanced the
2.5 percent, the most in three weeks. Athabasca Oil rose 4.7
percent to C$7.85, the stock’s highest price in over a month.  Catamaran, a provider of pharmacy benefits management, fell
9 percent to C$51.94, the lowest since July 17. Walgreen Co.,
one of the company’s main customers, said yesterday it would
switch its employees into a private insurance exchange in 2014.
Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst  Robert Jones  said the impact to PBMs
from the Walgreen move is “unclear.”  BlackBerry plunged 2.2 percent to C$10.64, erasing an
earlier gain of as much as 2 percent. The stock reversed after
Dow Jones reported the smartphone maker was preparing for
“deep” staff cuts by the end of the year, citing people
familiar with the situation. The shares rallied earlier on news
the company would start selling a new version of its phone next
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
