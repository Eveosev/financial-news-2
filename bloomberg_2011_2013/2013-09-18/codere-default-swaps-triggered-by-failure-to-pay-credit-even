Codere SA (CDR)  triggered credit-default
swaps insuring $445 million of the Spanish gaming company’s debt
by failing to make a timely bond payment.  The delay constituted a failure-to-pay credit event, the
International Swaps & Derivatives Association said on its
 website , which causes settlement of all outstanding default
swaps contract under the industry group’s rules.  Madrid-based Codere paid a coupon on $300 million of 9.25
percent bonds yesterday, two days after the end of a 30-day
grace period. The delay followed a Sept. 13 agreement with
lenders to provide 35 million euros ($47 million) in additional
debt as well as amendments to terms of outstanding loans.  There were a total of 3,202 swaps contracts linked to
Codere’s debt as of Sept. 13, according to the Depository Trust
& Clearing Corp., which runs a central registry for the market.  The company is also included in the Markit iTraxx Crossover
Index, though it may be removed when the benchmark changes this
week. A new version of the current index series will most likely
start trading without Codere one business day after the default
swaps auction, according to BNP Paribas.  Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
