Harvard University established the
Hutchins Center for African and African American Research with
more than $15 million given by  Glenn Hutchins , co-founder of the
 Silver Lake  investment firm.  The donation, given through the Hutchins Family Foundation,
is part of a $30 million gift Harvard announced last year, the
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based school said today in a  statement .  Harvard is accelerating its fundraising efforts as it
prepares to announce the start of a multiyear campaign to fund
teaching, research and construction projects. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., a professor of African and African American studies at
Harvard, will serve as director of the Hutchins Center.  “With this unprecedented gift from the Hutchins Family
Foundation, we secure our place as the pre-eminent site for
research about the African diaspora in the academy,” Gates said
in the statement.  Hutchins got his undergraduate degree from Harvard in 1977
and also earned MBA and law degrees there. Last week, Silver
Lake and  Michael Dell  won shareholder approval to buy computer
maker  Dell Inc. (DELL)  for $24.9 billion in the largest buyout of a
technology firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
