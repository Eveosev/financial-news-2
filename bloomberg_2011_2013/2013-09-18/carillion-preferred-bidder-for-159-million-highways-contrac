Carillion plc , a U.K. construction
and services provider, was selected as preferred bidder for a
12-year contract worth more than 100 million pounds ($159
million) to maintain Canadian highways.  Carillion will provide routine inspection, maintenance and
minor repairs for more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) of
highway in Ontario, the company said in a statement today.  The Wolverhampton, England-based company, which employs
about 40,000 people and is offering maintenance services for the
rail, oil and telecommunication industries, has been expanding
in Canada to make up for a construction slump in its U.K. home
market. The company’s share of revenue from the U.K. dropped to
78 percent of sales last year from more than 90 percent five
years earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Over the last 18 months, we have won long-term highways
maintenance contracts in Ontario and Alberta worth over 720
million pounds, which is making a significant contribution to
organic growth in our support services activities in  Canada ,”
Carillion Chief Executive Officer Richard Howson said.  Carillion gained as much as 1 percent to 324 pence in
London trading and was up 0.8 percent as of 9:02 a.m., valuing
the company at 1.4 billion pounds. Before today, the stock had
risen 1.2 percent this year while the FTSE 250 index surged 22
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
