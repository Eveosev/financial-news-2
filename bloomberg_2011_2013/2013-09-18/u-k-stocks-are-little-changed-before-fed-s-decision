U.K. stocks  declined for a second
day as investors awaited the  Federal Reserve ’s decision on
whether it will start reducing the size of its monthly bond-purchase program.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  slid 3.5 percent as Morgan
Stanley lowered its 12-month price estimate on the shares.
 Smiths Group Plc (SMIN)  climbed to its highest price since February
2011 after announcing a special dividend. Lloyds Banking Group
Plc followed a gauge of European banks higher.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  slipped 11.35 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,558.82 at the close of trading in London. The equity gauge has
still  rallied  8.8 percent from a June 24 low as Chinese economic
reports beat estimates and central banks pledged to leave
 interest rates  at record lows. The broader FTSE All-Share Index
lost 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped less
than 0.1 percent.  “Market participants do not have all their chips on the
table today, grinding out the day cautiously before we hear from
the Fed,” Ishaq Siddiqi, a market strategist at ETX Capital in
London, wrote in a note. “Most expect the central bank to
initiate the first round of tapering today, despite the fact
that momentum in the U.S. labour market is evidently slower than
the Fed hoped.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  ends a two-day policy
meeting today, at which officials will probably decide to lower
its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases. Data this month
showed U.S. payrolls and retail sales missed economists’
forecasts, while manufacturing grew faster than estimated.  Taper Forecasts  Of the 64 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News , 33
forecast the Fed will  reduce  its $85 billion in monthly asset
purchases by $5 billion or less. Another 31 predicted cuts of
$10 billion or more.  In the U.K., minutes from the  Bank of England  showed that
every member of the Monetary Policy Committee agreed at the
Sept. 3-4 meeting to keep stimulus measures unchanged.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 16 percent higher than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Aberdeen lost 3.5 percent to 367.3 pence as Morgan Stanley
lowered its 12-month price forecast on Scotland’s biggest money
manager to 407 pence from 435 pence, citing concern over the
performance of its global-equity and emerging-markets funds.  Crest Nicholson Holdings Plc (CRST)  declined 2 percent to 326.9
pence after Varde Partners Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG sold a
combined 33.9 million shares -- a 13.5 percent stake -- in the
U.K. homebuilder for 320 pence apiece.  Smiths Gains  Smiths Group climbed 2.6 percent to 1,412 pence after
saying it will pay a special dividend of 30 pence a share, or
118 million pounds ($188 million). Full-year sales rose 2
percent to 3.11 billion pounds, the company said in a statement.  Lloyds advanced 2.1 percent to 76.25 pence and  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN)  added 1.4 percent to 1,514 pence. A gauge of
lenders posted the  second-best performance  of the 19 industry
groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Fiberweb Plc (FWEB)  jumped 6.9 percent to 102.5 pence, its highest
price in six years, after the U.K. maker of fabric for diapers
accepted a takeover offer of 103.2 pence a share from Polymer
Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
