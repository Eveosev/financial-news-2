Copper swung between gains and
losses before the  Federal Reserve  concludes a two-day meeting
today when policy makers will decide whether to slow its monthly
bond-buying program.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $7,069.75 a metric ton by 10:55
a.m. in  Tokyo  after trading between $7,053 and $7,086.50. Copper
has lost 11 percent this year. Futures for delivery in December
fell 0.3 percent at $3.214 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  The  Federal Open Market Committee  has been meeting for two
days to consider whether it will taper its $85 billion a month
in bond buying. Purchases will probably be cut by $5 billion,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists, less than
estimated in previous surveys.  “Investors are awaiting the Fed’s announcement on whether
it intends to reduce its stimulus,” said Fang Junfeng, an
analyst at Shanghai CIFCO Futures Co. “Trading on the Shanghai
exchange should be quiet today as no one will take risks on the
four-day break, especially before the Fed’s decision later
today.”  Markets in China will be closed tomorrow and Sept. 20 for
the Mid-Autumn Festival holidays. Futures for delivery in
December on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.6 percent to
51,170  yuan  ($8,359) a ton.  On the LME, aluminum, lead and zinc climbed, while tin and
nickel dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
