Tampa Bay  Buccaneers safety Dashon Goldson can play against the  New England Patriots  this weekend
after winning his appeal of a one-game suspension that followed
a head-to-head hit in a loss to the  New Orleans Saints .  Goldson, 29 will practice today and be eligible for the
Sept. 22 game at the Patriots, the Buccaneers said on their
website.  After being fined $30,000 for an illegal hit in Week 1 of
the National Football League season, Goldson will draw a
$100,000 fine for lowering his head and ramming the helmet of
Saints running back Darren Sproles during Week 2, NFL.com said,
citing an unidentified person in the league. The $100,000 fine
would match that given to Detroit Lions defensive tackle
Ndamukong Suh for an illegal block during an opening-week win.  Had Goldson been banned, it would have been without pay and
cost him about $265,000, according to ESPN.  Goldson’s first-week fine was for an illegal hit of a
defenseless player in the Buccaneers’ Sept. 8 loss to the  New
York  Jets, when he struck tight end Jeff Cumberland in the head
and neck area.  A Pro Bowl player for the  San Francisco 49ers  in 2011 and
2012, Goldson signed a five-year contract with the Buccaneers
that the Tampa Bay Tribune said is worth $41 million. He’s had
16 tackles during the first two weeks of the season.  Tampa Bay is 0-2 this season, while the Patriots are 2-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
