German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
handling of the euro-area debt crisis continues to win her
support in northern  Europe , while southerners increasingly blame
her for their countries’ economic woes, a poll showed.  Merkel’s economic policies won the approval of 73 percent
of respondents in the Netherlands, 64 percent in Germany and 59
percent in  Sweden , according to a  poll  released today by the
 German Marshall Fund  of the  United States . Dissatisfaction with
the German leader was at 82 percent in  Spain  and 65 percent in
Portugal, up from 63 percent and 61 percent last year.  “The economic crisis and its management have come to
dominate the entire debate about Europe’s future,” said
Constanze Stelzenmueller, the fund’s senior trans-Atlantic
fellow. While northern Europeans seem to have accepted Merkel’s
“highly pragmatic” response to the crisis, there’s “reason to
be worried” about the discrepancies between north and south,
she said. “There’s a debate to be had about what is the right
policy here.”  Merkel’s leadership of the German and euro-area responses
to the debt crisis has been one of the main focuses of her
campaign to be re-elected chancellor on Sept. 22. She has
consistently said that southern European crisis countries must
implement budget cuts and structural reforms. The European
Commission forecast on May 3 that  Germany ’s economy would grow
0.4 percent in 2013, compared with contractions of 4.2 percent
in  Greece , 2.3 percent in Portugal and 1.5 percent in Spain.  National budgets  The survey showed that increasing numbers of voters are
against moves to give the European Commission greater control
over national budgets. Across Europe, 68 percent were against
handing over more power, up 11 percentage points from last year.
In Germany, 37 percent believe the commission should exercise
control over national economic policy, a decrease of 16
percentage points.  Less than a third of respondents in euro-area countries
want to abandon the single currency. About 30 percent in Spain,
27 percent in  France  and  Portugal  and 24 percent in Italy shared
that view.  Other highlights of the survey:  Handling of economy: Voters’ dissatisfaction with their
government’s handling of the economy has increased since last
year, with the largest change in France, where the proportion
rose to 74 percent from 57 percent.  EU membership: Belief that the EU has been good for the
economy is in decline, particularly in countries most affected
by the crisis. Support in Portugal for EU membership dropped to
49 percent from 69 percent.  Free-Trade Talks  Trans-Atlantic trade: 56 percent of respondents in Europe,
28 percent in  Turkey  and 49 percent in the U.S. said that
increased trans-Atlantic trade and investment would help their
economies grow. The survey was being carried out when, on June
14, EU countries authorized the European Commission, the bloc’s
regulatory arm, to start talks with the U.S. on a free-trade
agreement.  Iranian nuclear dispute: 32 percent of respondents in
Europe, 27 percent in Turkey and 29 percent in the U.S. said
economic sanctions on  Iran  are the best way to stop the country
from acquiring nuclear weapons.  Obama’s foreign policy: 69 percent of respondents in
Europe, 35 percent in Turkey and 50 percent in the U.S. said
they approved of President  Barack Obama ’s international
policies. This compared with 71 percent, 42 percent and 54
percent, respectively, last year.  Opposition to China: For the first time, the study asked
people what they thought about the prospect of Chinese “global
leadership.” In Europe, 65 percent found it undesirable,
compared with 72 percent in Turkey and 47 percent in the U.S.  The annual survey of 13,000 people was conducted in 11 EU
countries, Turkey and the U.S. June 3-27, although in Turkey the
interviews extended to July 2. The margin of error was 3
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
