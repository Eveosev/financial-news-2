Manikay Partners LLC, a New York-based hedge fund headed by two Australian Stock Exchange board
members, agreed to pay $2.6 million to settle charges of
improperly buying shares of companies they had bet against.  Manikay was sanctioned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission as part of an enforcement against 23 firms, the
agency said yesterday in a  statement .  ASX Board Member Shane Finemore is the managing partner of
Manikay. Russell Aboud, another member of the board of the ASX,
is chairman of the fund.  The stock exchange said today it’s aware of SEC’s
enforcement order against the firms, including Manikay Partners.  “The ASX Board is considering the potential governance
implications of the matter and will make any necessary
announcement in due course,” the exchange said in an e-mailed
statement.  Aboud and Finemore didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed
requests for comment, sent after regular business hours in  New
York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
