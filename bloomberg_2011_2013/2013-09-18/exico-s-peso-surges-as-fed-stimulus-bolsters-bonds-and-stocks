Mexico ’s peso surged to a one-month
high as the Federal Reserve refrained from paring the $85
billion pace of monthly bond buying, a stimulus program that’s
fueled demand for the Latin American nation’s securities.  The currency strengthened 1.1 percent to 12.7781 per U.S.
dollar at 1:22 p.m. in Mexico City, reversing losses of as much
as 0.5 percent. Yields on peso bonds maturing in 2024 tumbled 18
basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 5.95 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The peso had fallen 4.5 percent since Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said on May 22 that the U.S. may taper monthly asset
purchases. Foreign holdings of fixed-rate government bonds rose
to a record in May before speculation began to mount that a
reduction in U.S. stimulus was imminent.  “Valuations are cheap, especially since the taper did not
come,” Alejandro Urbina, who helps oversee $800 million at
Silva Capital Management LLC including Mexican government bonds,
said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Bond yields will
tighten and the peso should strengthen.”  Mexico’s  benchmark IPC stock index  of 35 companies rose 1.1
percent, the most in a week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
