Asian  stocks  rose before the
 Federal Reserve  decides later today whether to slow its $85
billion of monthly asset purchases.  Sharp Corp. climbed 1.6 percent in  Tokyo  as consumer
discretionary companies led gains on the Asia-Pacific benchmark
index.  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (7012)  surged 4.7 percent to a
six-year high amid unconfirmed reports the Japanese manufacturer
secured a 180 billion-yen ($1.8 billion) railcar order.  Kansai
Electric  Power Co. slid 1.9 percent in Tokyo after the utility
halted units at two  power plants .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.4 percent to 138.72 at
7:44 p.m. in Hong Kong as eight of the 10 industry groups on the
equity benchmark advanced. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rose 0.1 percent.  “Any sort of announcement, whether it’s zero tapering or
$5 billion or $10 billion is going to have an effect on the
market no matter what,” Nick Maroutsos, Sydney-based managing
director and co-founder of Kapstream Capital, which oversees
about $5 billion, said by telephone. “What we do know is that
it’s going to be a very, very gradual withdrawal of stimulus. We
are bullish on equities.”  Japan’s  Topix index  climbed 1 percent to a six-week high,
with volume 35 percent above the 30-day average. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 0.3 percent from a five-year high and New
Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index (NZSE50FG)  rose 0.1 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.3 percent and
Taiwan’s Taiex Index slid 0.5 percent. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index added 0.3 percent, while Singapore’s Straits
Times Index climbed 0.4 percent. South Korea’s equity market is
closed today for a holiday.  Fed Meeting  The  Federal Open Market Committee  is meeting to consider
whether it will taper its $85 billion a month in bond buying.
Analysts are divided on the amount by which the Fed will scale
back its monthly asset purchases. Among 64 economists surveyed
by  Bloomberg News , 33 predict it will reduce its buying of
Treasuries by $5 billion or less, with 31 forecasting a cut of
$10 billion or more.  “It’s so up in the air right now that no one really knows
what to expect,” said Maroutsos. “To say things are largely
priced into the market is a bit naive. Now that we’re getting
data that’s relatively positive, with the jobs market on the
right footing and the housing market doing better, this should
all be stock-market positive.”  Speculation over the future of the Fed’s quantitative
easing program has whipsawed global assets since May, when
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first signaled cuts may start in 2013.
The Asia-Pacific index climbed to a four-month high this week
after former Treasury Secretary  Lawrence Summers  withdrew his
bid to be the next Fed chairman.  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s 6.8 percent rally in 2013

among developed markets, amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
and the  Bank of Japan  can lead the country out of deflation
through unprecedented monetary easing. About 13 trillion yen

Topix last week after the city’s winning bid for the 2020
 Olympic Games  was announced, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Share Offer  Sharp Corp. (6753) , which supplies Apple Inc. with liquid-crystal
