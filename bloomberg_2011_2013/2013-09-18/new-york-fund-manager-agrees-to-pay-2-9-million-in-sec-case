A  New York  hedge-fund manager
agreed to pay more than $2.9 million to settle U.S. regulatory
claims that he violated his fiduciary duty by engineering an
undisclosed principal transaction in which he had a financial
conflict of interest.  Shadron Stastney, a partner at investment advisory firm
Vicis Capital LLC, was also barred from association with an
 investment company  or broker-dealer for at least 18 months, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement today. In
settling the claims, Stastney didnâ€™t admit or deny wrongdoing,
the SEC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
