U.S. mortgage lending increased by
38 percent in 2012, driven by refinancings, according to bank
regulators’ data released by the federal government today.  “The total number of originated loans of all types and
purposes reported increased by about 2.7 million, or 38 percent,
from 2011, in part because of a 54 percent increase in the
number of refinancings,” the agencies said in the release of
mortgage lending data at 7,400 financial institutions covered by
the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.  Home-purchase lending increased by 13 percent during the
same period, the regulators said.  The  Federal Housing Administration ’s share of first-lien
lending fell to 27 percent, from 31 percent in 2011.  The group of regulators releasing the data includes the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the  Federal Reserve , the
 National Credit Union Administration , Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
