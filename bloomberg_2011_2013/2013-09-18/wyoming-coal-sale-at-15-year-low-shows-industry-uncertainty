The U.S. government rejected the
sale of coal in Wyoming after an auction drew the lowest top  bid 
in 15 years, as the outlook for the power-plant fuel weakens
because of cheap natural gas and new rules coming out this week.  The Bureau of Land Management turned down the bid of $35
million, or 21 cents a ton, by Kiewit Mining Group Inc., based
in Omaha,  Nebraska , for the 167 million tons of Powder River
Basin  coal , the agency said today in a statement. The rejection
follows a BLM sale in August that attracted no bidders.  The company’s offer was less than one-fifth what mining
companies paid for similar deposits last year, and the lowest
amount per ton since 1998. It didn’t meet the government’s
estimate of fair value, the bureau said in a statement.  “The bottom has just dropped out of the market,” Mark
Northam, director of the University of  Wyoming  School of Energy
Resources, said by telephone. “This represents a high degree of
uncertainty about whether coal will stay robust in the future.”  Pending rules from the Environmental Protection Agency will
depress the use of coal for power generation, Northam said. The
agency is set to issue its proposal for emission controls on new
power stations this week, and follow that up with rules
constraining carbon-dioxide emissions from existing plants in
2014. Coal produces twice the carbon dioxide as natural gas when
burned to make power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
