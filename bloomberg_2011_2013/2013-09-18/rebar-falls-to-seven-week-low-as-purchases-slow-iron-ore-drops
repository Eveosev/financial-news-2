Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai fell to the lowest level in seven weeks as purchases of
the building material slowed before a national holiday and as
 iron ore  prices declined.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to 3,626  yuan  ($592) a
metric ton, the lowest since July 31, before trading at 3,631
yuan at 10:18 a.m. The market will be closed in China for a Mid-Autumn Festival tomorrow and Sept. 20.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port slumped 2.2
percent yesterday to $131.10 a dry ton, the lowest since Aug. 5,
according to a  price index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The
average spot price of rebar retreated 0.4 percent to 3,533 yuan
a ton yesterday, dropping for a ninth day, according to Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  “End-users’ purchases of building materials slowed before
the holiday and demand in September hasn’t been as strong as we
had previously expected,” said Li Jinlu, an analyst at Yongan
Futures Co. in Hangzhou. “It’s the last trading day before the
holiday so usually investors trim their positions to avoid
uncertainties.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
