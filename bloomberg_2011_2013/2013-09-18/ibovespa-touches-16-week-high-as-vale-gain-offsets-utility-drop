The Ibovespa touched a 16-week high
as a gain in commodity prices boosted Brazilian exporters
including iron-ore producer Vale SA, offsetting losses in
electric utilities.  Pulp producer Suzano Papel & Celulose SA rose the most on
the MSCI  Brazil /Materials  Index. (CMCIPI)  Homebuilders including  Rossi
Residencial SA (RSID3)  advanced as traders pared bets for higher
borrowing costs. Cia. Energetica de  Minas Gerais  led power
utilities lower after O Estado de S.Paulo reported that Brazil
plans to change the rules used to grant license renewals.  The Ibovespa was little changed at 54,309.08 at 11:09 a.m.
in Sao Paulo after earlier rising to 54,419.09, the highest
level on a closing basis since May 29. The real climbed 0.4
percent to 2.2479 per dollar. The UBS Bloomberg Constant
Maturity Commodity Index of 27 raw materials advanced 0.2
percent as investors awaited a Federal Reserve announcement on
the prospects for U.S. monetary stimulus that has buoyed demand
for riskier assets including Brazilian stocks.  “Everyone is waiting to see what the Fed will do, and
while we can’t rule out anything, it doesn’t look like assets
are pricing in a drastic reduction in stimulus,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, the head strategist at Futura Corretora brokerage, said
in a phone interview from  Sao Paulo . “Utilities are having a
hard time today because of all the concern that, once again, the
government will change the rules for these companies.”  Brazil plans to demand that electricity distributors with
licenses expiring between 2015 and 2017 boost investment and
meet targets for service quality when applying for a renewal, O
Estado de S.Paulo reported today, citing an unidentified aide to
President  Dilma Rousseff .  Vale, the heaviest-weighted stock on the Ibovespa, gained
0.6 percent to 33.16 reais. Suzano advanced 1.6 percent to 9.50
reais. Rossi jumped 2 percent to 3.09 reais. Cemig, as
Energetica de Minas Gerais is also known, dropped 1.8 percent to
18.29 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
