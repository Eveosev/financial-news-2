Rubber growers in  Ivory Coast  urged
the government to withdraw taxes it imposed on the industry,
saying the charges may reduce purchases of the commodity.  Ivory Coast implemented last year a 3 percent tax on
processing facilities for granulated rubber, and raised the levy
to 5 percent earlier this year. The government also implemented
a 2.5 percent tax on producers’ income and a 7,500 CFA francs
($15) monthly tax per farmed hectare (2.47 acres).  These taxes contributed to lower revenue and profit for
growers and processors, and may reduce factories’ scope for
buying rubber from farmers next year, Wadjas Honest, president
of the Association of Natural Rubber Producers, said in an
interview yesterday in Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s commercial
capital.  Producer Societe Africaine de Plantations D’Heveas, which
is part of Sifca Group, said last month its profit for the first
half of the year declined 24 percent to 8.65 billion  CFA francs 
as prices dropped 21 percent in the same period.  “The taxes have been set when the prices were high,”
Bruno Kone, a government spokesman, said today following a
ministerial meeting. “Talks are under way to set up a
stabiliser mechanism to support rubber producers.”  Ivory Coast produced 256,000 metric tons of rubber in 2012
and targets output of 600,000 tons by 2020, according to
Apromac, a trade association. The West African nation has 16
rubber factories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
