keeping striker Wayne Rooney and signing a central midfielder,
the newspaper added.  Liverpool Targets Traore  Liverpool and Galatasaray may move to sign Anzhi
Makhachkala striker Lacina Traore in January, the  Daily Express
reported .  The Reds hold a long-standing interest in the Ivory Coast
forward, who scored 12 goals in 24 games for Anzhi last season,
the newspaper added.  Ba Committed  Demba Ba is committed to Chelsea even after saying he
wanted to join Arsenal on loan in search of more first-team
starts, the  Guardian reported .  Ba’s move to the Gunners broke down on transfer deadline

a Premier League competitor, the newspaper added.  Agger’s Accident  Liverpool defender Daniel Agger injured his rib in the gym
when trying to prevent a dumbbell from falling on his foot, the
