Vale SA (VALE) , the world’s third-largest
mining company, is selling stakes in its cargo unit for about
$1.2 billion to Japan’s Mitsui & Co. and a Brazilian government
fund as it seeks to focus on higher-return assets.  The iron-ore producer based in Rio de Janeiro agreed to
sell a 20 percent stake in the VLI unit to Mitsui for 1.51
billion reais ($675 million) and 15.9 percent to the FI-FGTS
fund managed by state-owned bank Caixa Economica Federal for 1.2
billion reais, according to a regulatory filing today. Vale said
it’s also in exclusive talks with Canada’s  Brookfield Asset
Management Inc. (BAM/A)  to sell about 26 percent of VLI. Its stake would
drop to less than 40 percent after all the deals, Vale said.  Vale is selling assets, suspending projects and focusing on
its more profitable iron-ore business in a bid to recover profit
margins amid lower commodities prices. The VLI unit, which
controls ports, terminals and more than 10,000 kilometers (6,215
miles) of railroads in  Brazil , plans to invest 9 billion reais
through 2017 to expand capacity in Latin America’s largest
economy.  “Vale will have a minority stake when the three new
shareholders have concluded everything and we are even thinking
in the future of holding a public offering” of shares in the
unit, Vale Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira told
reporters today in Brasilia. “We believe in the next few years
we will all perceive a big change in the Brazilian logistics
system.”  Vale  fell  0.4 percent to 32.86 reais at 2 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo , heading to the lowest close since Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
