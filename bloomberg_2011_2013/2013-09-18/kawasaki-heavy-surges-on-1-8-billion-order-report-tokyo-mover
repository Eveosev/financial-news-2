Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (7012) , the
Japanese maker of trains and gas turbines, rose the most in more
than a month in  Tokyo  trading after TV Tokyo said the company
won a 180 billion yen ($1.8 billion) railcar order.  The stock advanced as much as 7.5 percent, the most since
July 30, to 415 yen, and traded at 404 yen as of 11:10 a.m. It
was the second-biggest gain among companies in Japan’s benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average, which added 1.8 percent.  The company, based in Kobe, western Japan, won an order to
supply railcars for a project in New York’s Long Island, TV
Tokyo said in a report dated yesterday. Nothing has been decided
on the order, Yoshiyuki Kinugasa, a spokesman for Kawasaki
Heavy, said by phone from Tokyo today.  Japanese train makers are targeting overseas orders as the
nation’s population shrinks.  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  won an order with John
Laing for a 4.5 billion pound ($7 billion) U.K. train order last
year, and Kinki Sharyo Co. got an order from Los Angeles for
light-rail vehicles a few months earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
