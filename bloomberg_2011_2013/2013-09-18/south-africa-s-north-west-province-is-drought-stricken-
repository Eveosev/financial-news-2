North West Province has been
declared drought-stricken under the Disaster Management Act, the
South African Press Association reported, citing the provincial
government.  Intervention may be needed as Mamusa Dam has almost dried
up and water shortages have occurred in Mamus and Greater Taung,
where drinking waters are being delivered by tanker to
communities, SAPA said, citing the premier’s spokesman, Lesiba
Kgwele.  Platinum mined at Rustenburg and gold at Orkney help
support the province’s economy.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) ,
Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. and Lonmin Plc, the world’s three
largest producers of the metal, operate in the region, which is
sometimes referred to as the “platinum province.”  The province also produces about 16 percent of the nation’s
corn and insufficient rain during planting season will lead to
lower-than average yields, according to analysts and traders
from BVG (Pty) Ltd., Senwes Ltd. and Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd.
 South Africa  is the biggest producer of the grain on the
continent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
