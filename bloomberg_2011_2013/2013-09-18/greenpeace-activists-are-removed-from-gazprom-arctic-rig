Two environmental activists who
climbed an  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  Arctic rig to protest planned oil
extraction were taken into custody following warning shots from
 Russia ’s Coast Guard.  The maritime force fired 11 shots while calling on
Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise ship to leave the area, the campaign
group said today in an e-mailed statement.  Gazprom, Russia’s largest company, plans to begin the
nation’s first oil production in Arctic seas at the
Prirazlomnoye deposit this year. Greenpeace activists scaled the
same offshore drilling platform in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
