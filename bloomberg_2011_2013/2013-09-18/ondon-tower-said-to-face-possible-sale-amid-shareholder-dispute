Heron Tower, one of the tallest
buildings in the City of London financial district, may be sold
because of a dispute between its owners, a person with knowledge
of the matter said.  The owners, including developer Heron International Ltd.
and the State General Reserve of Oman Fund, have yet to agree on
how to pay a 315 million-pound ($503 million) loan owed to a
group of banks led by  Wells Fargo & Co ., said the person, who
asked not to be named because because the matter is private.  The tower, which opened in March 2011, has tenants
accounting for about 60 percent of its space, according to Heron
International. Nearby skyscrapers such as  Land Securities Group
Plc (LAND) ’s Walkie Talkie building and British Land Co.’s Cheesegrater
tower at 122 Leadenhall Street, which are still under
construction, have secured tenants for a similar proportion of
the space.  Citigroup Inc. and Starwood Capital Group LLC are among
several companies that have offered to refinance the debt
attached to the building, the person said. Members of the Saudi
royal family also own a stake in the 46-story Heron Tower.  Shelley Beason, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, and
 Charlotte  Palmer, a London-based spokeswoman for Heron
International who works for Redleaf Polhill, declined to
comment.  Sky News  reported the possible sale earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
