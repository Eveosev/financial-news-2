When a house is priced at more than $10 million, it often takes awhile to sell. Selling after just one month on the market is not normal for a property priced at $12.995 million, but then again, this is no normal house. Owned by Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, this extraordinary home was completely overhauled by the celeb couple and  showcased in Elle Decor . First listed for $10.995 million, the home also had a price increase — and still closed in just six weeks. However, the increase of price may have been for naught. The final sale price on the estate is $10.85 million, according to a source, less than their original ask. DeGeneres and de Rossi bought the rustic Thousand Oaks, CA property back in 2008. It holds 2 barns and 8 guest cabins, each designed in a different mood — ranging from contemporary to more romantic — and all featuring an eclectic mix of high-end and custom furnishings. Although DeGeneres confessed in the Elle Decor article that the property was de Rossi’s “dream home,” apparently the pair were able to find a replacement place: They dropped  $26.5 million on a 13-acre Montecito property earlier this year . But don’t expect the couple to remain settled in their new home for long, though. DeGeneres is well-known for her real estate moves. The Thousand Oaks listing was held by  Suzanne Perkins  and  Patrick Martin  of  Sotheby’s International Realty . See a video tour of the property . Related items from  Zillow Blog .
