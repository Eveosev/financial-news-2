Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) ,  Europe ’s
biggest water company, may offer a cash-only option for its 2013
dividend, according to a report by Bryan, Garnier & Co.  Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot “will push the
board to remove the scrip option,” analyst Julien Desmaretz,
who has a ‘buy’ rating on the shares, wrote after meeting with
the Paris-based utility’s managers.  “Making the dividend fully paid in cash will not only
prevent any further severe dilution for shareholders but also
send a key positive signal to investors that the group is on-track to at least reach initial targets,” the analyst said.  Veolia is more than 18 months into a plan to lower debt and
boost profit by selling assets, shrinking its geographic
footprint and increasing industrial water and waste contracts.
First-half  profit  was almost wiped out by impairments on waste
services in  Germany , the company said last month.  Veolia, whose  shares  have risen 44 percent this year, cut
its dividend to 70 euro cents a share for 2011, 2012 and 2013
from a previous 1.21 euros. The 2011 and 2012 payouts were in
cash or shares.  “There is room for dividend increase in the mid-term” as
of 2015, according to the Bryan, Garnier report. “The CEO
suggested he would ask for the removal of the dilutive scrip
option.” Veolia spokeswoman Sandrine Guendoul declined to
comment.  An update of Veolia’s operations showed the 750-million
euro ($1 billion) cost-cutting plan is “on track” and trends
in  waste treatment  improving for volume and pricing, the report
said.  Veolia has a goal to sell 6 billion euros of assets by this
year and intends to lower costs and increase industrial
contracts with a focus on “high-growth” economies such as
 China  that counters weakening demand in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
