Rubber climbed for a second day
amid speculation that China, the world’s largest consumer, may
make purchases from local suppliers for government stockpiles.  The contract for February delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange gained as much as 1.5 percent to 277.6 yen a kilogram
($2,796 a metric ton) and traded at 274 yen at 10:52 a.m.  China held discussions with suppliers about buying 200,000
tons of rubber for state stockpiles, two industry executives
with direct knowledge of the matter said yesterday. China will
pay a premium of 300  yuan  ($49) per ton over the prevailing
rubber futures prices in the month of delivery, they said.  “The expectation for Chinese purchases provides support to
rubber futures,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker
Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  The State Reserve Bureau met  Sinochem International Corp. (600500) ,
 China Hainan Rubber Industry Group Co. (601118)  and Yunnan State Farms
Group Co., the nation’s biggest domestic suppliers, about buying
150,000 tons of rubber, said the executives. The bureau is also
in discussions to buy 50,000 tons of smoked rubber sheet
imports, they said.  The contract for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 0.8 percent to 20,225 yuan a ton.  Thai rubber 
free-on-board was unchanged at 82.70 baht ($2.60) a kilogram
yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
