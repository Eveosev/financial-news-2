The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 1 basis point to
110 basis points as of 10:29 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The gauge is set for its
lowest close since May 29, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 1 basis point to 132 as of
8:21 a.m. in  Singapore ,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The
measure, which has ranged from 99.5 to 177.8 since Dec. 31, is
poised to decline 31.4 basis points this month, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 0.5 of a basis point
to 83.5 basis points as of 9:16 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The indicator, which traded between 74 and 148.1
basis points this year, touched a four-month low of 84
yesterday, CMA data show. A close of 83.5 would be the lowest
since May 23.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
