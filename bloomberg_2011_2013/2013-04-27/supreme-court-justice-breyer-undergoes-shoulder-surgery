U.S. Supreme Court Justice  Stephen
Breyer  underwent shoulder-replacement surgery today after
falling from his bicycle, according to a court statement.  Breyer’s surgery was to repair a fracture sustained in his
right shoulder following a fall from his bicycle near the Korean
War Veterans Memorial in Washington yesterday. The surgery,
which was performed at Georgetown University Hospital, was
successful and the justice is expected to be released from the
hospital “early in the week,” according to the statement.  Breyer, 74, was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1994 by
former Democratic President  Bill Clinton .  To contact the reporter on this story:
