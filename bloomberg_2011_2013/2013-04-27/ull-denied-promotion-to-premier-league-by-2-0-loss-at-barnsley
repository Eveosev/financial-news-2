Hull was denied promotion to
English soccer’s Premier League by losing 2-0 at Barnsley.  Hull would have joined Cardiff City in moving up from the
second-tier Championship with a victory. However, goals from
Jacob Mellis and Chris O’Grady sent the promotion race to the
final week of the season.  Hull is in second place with 78 points, one more than
Watford. Hull hosts Cardiff, which has already won the title in
the Championship, in its final match and Watford plays Leeds.
The top two teams gain automatic promotion to the Premier
League, while the next four teams play off for another berth.  Watford will be in the playoffs if it doesn’t overtake
Hull. Brighton, Crystal Palace and Bolton hold the remaining
playoff places, with Nottingham Forest and Leicester still in
contention.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
