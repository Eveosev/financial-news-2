Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock

 Savola Group (SAVOLA)  and  Saudi Arabian Cement Co. (SACCO)  as earnings beat
estimates.  Savola, a food retailer, advanced to a more than six-year
high, while Saudi Arabian Cement, the kingdom’s second-biggest
producer of building materials by market value, increased to the

quarter earnings results being released, which showed an
increase in cement, agricultural and food-processing sectors,
which is evident in today’s trading led by Savola,” Turki Fadaak, head of research and consultancy at Albilad Investment
Company, said in an e-mail.  Savola posted a 22 percent increase in first-quarter profit

months through June. Saudi  Arabian Cement (ARCCO) ’s posted a 4.5 percent
increase in first-quarter profit to 340.3 million riyals.  Savola rose 2.2 percent to 47 riyals and Saudi Arabian
