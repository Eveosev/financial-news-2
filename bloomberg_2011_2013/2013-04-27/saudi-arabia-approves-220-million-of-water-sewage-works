Saudi Arabia  has approved 824
million riyals ($220 million) of water and sanitation projects
across the kingdom, state-owned  Saudi Press Agency  reported,
citing Minister of Water and Electricity Abdullah Al-Hussayen.  The 32 contracts include the construction of pumping
stations, sewage systems and plants, including a water feeder
line in Qassim province valued at 278 million riyals, SPA said.
Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer, is also the largest
producer of desalinated water.  Saudi Arabia spent $1.1 billion last year on 128 water and
sanitation contracts just in the capital Riyadh. In January, Al-
Hussayen said $6.4 billion had been designated for water and
sanitation projects in 2013. The ministry has listed 160 water
projects around the kingdom this year on its official website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
