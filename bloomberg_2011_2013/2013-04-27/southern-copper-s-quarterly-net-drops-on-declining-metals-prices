Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , the largest
producer of the metal in Peru and  Mexico , said first-quarter
profit fell for a fourth quarter on declining copper and silver
prices, matching analysts’ estimates.  Net income declined 20.3 percent to $495.4 million, or 59
cents a share, from $621.4 million, or 73 cents, a year earlier,
the Phoenix-based company said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. Profit, excluding one-time items, was in line with
the average of five analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales fell 10 percent to $1.62 billion. Copper futures in
 New York  averaged 4.8 percent lower in the quarter than a year
ago, while silver prices fell 8 percent. Costs rose as the
company met interest payments on a $1.5 billion debt offering in
November, said Inteligo SAB analyst Lali Merino, who doesn’t own
shares and rates the stock a buy.  “With copper production little changed, earnings were
mainly hit by lower metals prices,” Merino said in a telephone
interview from  Lima  before the report was released. “Financial
costs were also a factor as they took on a lot of debt compared
with a year earlier.”  Southern Copper  sold a total $1.5 billion in 2022 and 2042
bonds in November, increasing its long-term debt by 53 percent
to $4.2 billion. The bond sale added to a previous $1.5 billion
offering in April 2010.  Quarterly copper production declined 2.2 percent to 149,485
metric tons, while silver output fell 8 percent. Zinc and
molybdenum both rose 4 percent.  The company, which is 81 percent owned by Grupo Mexico SAB,
plans to increase copper production capacity 84 percent to 1.18
million tons by 2017. Copper for July delivery fell 1.7 percent
to $3.186 a pound yesterday on the Comex in New York.  Grupo Mexico’s first-quarter net income fell 19.6 percent
to $576.7 million, the company said in a separate statement
yesterday.  The report was released after the close of regular market
trading. Southern Copper slid 68 cents, or 2 percent, to $32.89
in New York.  Grupo Mexico  fell 1.6 percent to 42.52 pesos in
Mexico.  (Southern Copper is scheduled to have its quarterly conference
