Oklahoma City Thunder guard  Russell
Westbrook  will miss the rest of the National Basketball
Association playoffs after undergoing knee surgery today.  Westbrook tore cartilage in his right knee in Game 2 of the
Thunder’s first-round series with the Houston Rockets on April
24. A timetable for the three-time All-Star’s return will be
determined during the offseason, the Thunder said in a
statement.  Westbrook averaged 23.2 points per game during the regular
season, sixth-best in the league and second on the team to
forward Kevin Durant. He also contributed 7.4 assists per game,
1.8 steals and a career-high 5.2 rebounds.  Oklahoma City leads the best-of-seven series 2-0 with Game
3 tonight in Houston.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
