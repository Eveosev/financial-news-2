The Treasury 10-year note yield
fell to the lowest level this year as a government report
showing the economy grew at a slower pace than forecast in the
first three months boosted demand for the safest assets.  Benchmark  yields  dropped for a second week as bidding
increased at three offerings of Treasury notes totaling $99
billion as economic data continued to suggest the pace of
economic growth is slowing. The  Federal Reserve  meets to discuss
monetary policy April 30-May 1, while the Labor Department will
say May 2 that the economy added 150,000 jobs in April,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  “You’re seeing some modest gains based upon the notion
that the economy is slowing,” said  Kevin Flanagan , a Purchase,
New York-based fixed-income strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney. Expectations from the Fed for weaker data may “keep the
current program going longer than was originally thought a
couple of months ago,” he said.  The 10-year  note yield  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.66 percent this week in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It touched 1.64 percent
on April 23, the lowest level since Dec. 12. The price of the 2
percent note maturing in February 2023 rose 3/8, or $3.75 per
$1,000 face value, to 103 1/32.  Yields on the  30-year bond  fell two basis points to 2.86
percent on the week.  Demand Rises  Demand at the Treasury’s sales of $35 billion of two-year
notes, $35 billion of five-year debt and $29 billion of seven-
year securities was the highest in at least three months. The
securities sold at the lowest yields of the year.  Even with the recent pickup, bidding at Treasury auctions
this year has slowed versus 2012, with the $721 billion in debt
sales attracting an average of $3.01 in orders to buy per dollar
of debt sold, compared with a record $3.15 the previous year,
data released by the Treasury and compiled by Bloomberg show.  “You need to see the economy really starting to do well
before you really start getting comfortable,” said Douglas Swanson, co-manager of a $29 billion fund at JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s J.P. Morgan Asset Management. As for the Fed, “even
though there’s been a lot of talk about tapering, you still feel
that’s not going to happen too early. With the economic numbers
that have come out more recently, that’s a lot less likely to
happen this year.”  ‘Aggressive Bernanke’  Fed policy makers including Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  have
said they’ll maintain their $85 billion of monthly Treasury and
mortgage debt buying until the labor market improves
“significantly.” Minutes of their March meeting showed they
discussed slowing the pace of purchases this year.  “Bernanke has been pretty consistent and he’s being more
aggressive than the market anticipates,” said Swanson, who
manages the  JPMorgan Core Bond Fund. (WOBDX)   Gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annual rate,
lower than forecast, after a 0.4 percent fourth-quarter advance,
Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington . The
median estimate of 86 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a 3 percent gain.  Consumer spending , the biggest part of the
economy, climbed by the most since the fourth quarter of 2010.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final April
index of  consumer sentiment  declined to 76.4 from 78.6 in March.
Economists projected 73.5 for the gauge after a preliminary
April reading of 72.3, according to the mediate estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  Biggest Drop  In falling to yesterday’s low of 1.66 percent, the yield
has had its biggest drop since the period from April 27 to June
1, 2012, when it slid 0.48 percentage point to a then record-low
1.45 percent as  Europe ’s debt crisis worsened.  Treasury volatility as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE index  fell for a fourth day to a record low on
April 25, reaching 49.39 basis points yesterday, below the low
of 49.75 basis points reached April 24, as the Fed supports the
market with asset buying. The data, which measures price swings,
stretches back to 1988.  “Investors aren’t convinced there’s any reason to
meaningfully sell off Treasuries at the moment,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at the broker-dealer BTIG LLC
in New York. “Growth remains less than desirable.”  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  reversed 
from a net-short position to a net-long position in 30-year bond
futures in the week ending April 23, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Long Bets  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 1,337 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the most in 2013. Last week, traders were net-
short 8,968 contracts.  In 10-year  note futures , speculative long positions
outnumbered short positions by 120,640 contracts, according to
CFTC data. Net-long positions fell by 14,732 contracts, or 11
percent, from a week earlier, according to the data.  The  bond market  has become more pessimistic on the economy
in the last six weeks. On March 11, the  10-year Treasury yield 
closed at 2.06 percent, its high for the year, up from 1.76
percent at the end of 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
