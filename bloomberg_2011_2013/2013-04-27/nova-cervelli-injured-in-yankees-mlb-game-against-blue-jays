New York Yankees starting pitcher
Ivan Nova and catcher  Francisco Cervelli  joined the team’s
injured corps during last night’s 6-4 win against the Toronto
Blue Jays.  Cervelli, 27, fractured his right hand on the fifth pitch
of the game when he was hit by Rajai Davis’s foul tip, the team
said. Cervelli will have surgery today and miss at least six
weeks, the Yankees said on their website.  “It’s disappointing, and I know it’s really disappointing
for him because of all that he’s been through to get to this
point,” said Yankees manager  Joe Girardi .  In the third inning, Nova, 26, grimaced in pain while
pitching to Davis and was scheduled to have an MRI for elbow
pain. Nova is 1-1 with an earned-run average of 6.48 this
season.  “Guys keep stepping up,” Girardi told reporters. “You
just keep finding ways. That’s what you do.”  In addition to Cervelli and Nova, the Yankees are playing
without Curtis Granderson,  Derek Jeter ,  Alex Rodriguez , Mark Teixeira,  Kevin Youkilis , Cesar Cabral and Michael Pineda.  Chris Stewart replaced Cervelli, who hit his third home run
of the season in the Yankees’ 5-3 win against the Blue Jays two
days ago. Cervelli is batting .269 with three doubles and has
driven in eight runs in 17 games.  The Yankees (13-9) said on their website that Austin Romine, who is hitting .341 for the team’s minor-league
affiliate in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, was called up to replace
Cervelli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
