The pound jumped the most in nine
months against the dollar this week as a government report
showed the U.K. economy avoided a recession last quarter,
damping speculation the  Bank of England  will boost stimulus.  Sterling strengthened versus all except one of its 16 major
counterparts as Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said
the data was an encouraging sign the economy is improving. The
Bank of England next meets on May 8-9 after policy makers were
split this month on whether to extend the 375 billion-pound
($581 billion) asset-purchase  program  that tends to devalue a
currency. U.K. government bonds fell as the  gross-domestic-
product  report spurred demand for higher-yielding assets.  “The pound rebounded as the GDP surprise prompted some in
the market to cover short sterling positions,” said  Neil Jones ,
head of hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
 London , referring to traders ending bets the currency would
weaken. “The U.K. data isn’t blowing the doors off but with
expectations being low and the market being short, there’s room
for it to gain further.”  The pound advanced 1.6 percent this week to $1.5489 as of
5 p.m. in London yesterday, the biggest gain since the period
ended April 20. The U.K. currency appreciated 1.8 percent over
the five trading days to 84.11 pence per euro, snapping three
weeks of losses.  The pound has strengthened 2.3 percent in the past month,
the best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. Sterling is still
down 2.6 percent this year.  GDP Expands  U.K.  gross domestic product  grew 0.3 percent in the first
quarter, the  Office for National Statistics  said on April 25.
The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for growth of 0.1 percent. From a year earlier, GDP expanded 0.6
percent, the most since the fourth quarter of 2011.  “I can’t promise the road ahead will always be smooth but
by continuing to confront our problems head on, Britain is
recovering and we are building an economy fit for the future,”
Osborne said in a statement released by the Treasury that day.  The benchmark 10-year gilt  yield  rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, this week to 1.68 percent. The 1.75
percent bond maturing in September 2022 declined 0.145, or 1.45
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 100.615.  Gilts returned 1.3 percent this year through April 25,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
0.9 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 0.7 percent.  The U.K. Treasury will sell 500 million pounds of
inflation-linked securities due in March 2062 on April 30 and a
combined 2 billion pounds of bills on May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
