The European Commission opened an
anti-subsidy investigation into imports of solar glass from
 China , based on a complaint lodged by EU ProSun Glass.  The probe may last as long as 13 months, though the
European Union could impose provisional anti-subsidy duties
within nine months, the Brussels-based commission said in a
statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
