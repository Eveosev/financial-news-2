Tianlang Guan, the 14-year-old
amateur from China who became the youngest person to make the
midway cut at the  Masters Tournament , qualified for weekend play
at the  Zurich Classic of New Orleans  as well.  Guan shot a 3-under-par 69 yesterday at TPC Louisiana with
five birdies and two bogeys to finish 36 holes at 3 under, just
enough to stay in the tournament for today’s third round and
tomorrow’s final round. The cut line was 3 under.  Guan enters the third round tied for 57th place, nine
strokes behind leader  Lucas Glover  of the U.S., who was at 12
under after two rounds of the U.S. PGA Tour event.  Eighth-grader Guan earlier this month at the Masters became
the youngest player to appear in a major golf championship in
148 years. Having qualified by winning the Asia-Pacific Amateur
Championship in November, he finished the Masters in 58th place
at 12 over par.  To contact the reporter on this story:
