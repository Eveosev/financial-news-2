The  Philadelphia Eagles  selected
University of Southern California quarterback Matt Barkley in
the fourth round of the National Football League draft.  Philadelphia chose Barkley, 22, with the opening pick of
the draft’s final day, the 98th overall selection, after trading
with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  Barkley was projected to be a first-round pick in last
year’s draft, but opted to return to school for his senior
season. He threw for 36 touchdowns, but missed time with a
shoulder injury as USC struggled to a 7-6 record after opening
the season ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press media poll.  The  New York Giants  took Syracuse quarterback Ryan Nassib
with the 13th pick of the fourth round. Nassib set school records
as a senior last season by throwing for 26 touchdowns and 3,749
yards.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
