Detroit’s Anibal Sanchez struck out
17 Atlanta Braves in eight innings in the Tigers’ 10-0 home win.  Sanchez (3-1), who allowed five hits and walked one last
night, broke the team record of 16 strikeouts set by Mickey Lolich on May 23, 1969, and matched by Lolich less than three
weeks later.  “It’s hard to get much better than that,” Tigers manager
 Jim Leyland  said.  Sanchez, who threw 121 pitches, fell three strikeouts shy
of the Major League Baseball record shared by Roger Clemens and
 Kerry Wood .  “I don’t think too much about strikeouts and records and
things like that,” Sanchez said. “I prefer getting zeros.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
