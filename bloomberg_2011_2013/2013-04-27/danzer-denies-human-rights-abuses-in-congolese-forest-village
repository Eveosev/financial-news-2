Danzer Group, a Switzerland-based
wood processor, denied accusations by activist groups that one
of its senior managers was responsible for  human rights  abuses
in the  Democratic Republic  of Congo in 2011.  Global Witness , a London-based advocacy group, and the
European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights filed a
complaint with the state prosecutor’s office in Tubingen,
Germany, on April 25 against a senior manager of Danzer’s former
subsidiary, Siforco. They accused Siforco of providing financial
and logistical help to Congolese police and military in an
attack on the village of Bongulu, on May 2, 2011.  Siforco officials didn’t know the police intended to attack
the village when they were “forced” to provide a company
vehicle to use as transport, Danzer said in an e-mailed
statement today. “The event is most regrettable, but was beyond
the control of Siforco,” it said.  Congolese security forces raped and injured villagers and
destroyed property during the attack, according to Global
Witness and the ECCHR. Siforco provided medical support and
compensation for the victims after the attack, Danzer said
today.  Congolese police went to the village to recover equipment
and material stolen from Siforco, it said.  Danzer sold Siforco to Congo-based Blattner group in
February, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
