Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker will take charge of relations with religious
communities and Finance Minister Luc Frieden will also become
communications minister in a government shuffle.  Juncker, who will stay prime minister and treasury
minister, announced a governmental reorganization today after
the resignations of Justice Minister Francois Biltgen and
Family, Integration and Cooperation Minister Marie-Josee Jacobs.
Biltgen is a candidate for a vacancy later this year as
Luxembourg judge at the European Union Court of Justice, the
EUâ€™s highest court.  Octavie Modert, the culture minister, will add the role of
justice minister and Marc Spautz will become the new family,
integration and cooperation minister.  The government in its new form will meet for the first time
on Friday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
