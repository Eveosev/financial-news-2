Bayern Munich beat Freiburg 1-0 to
break the records for points and wins in a season in German
soccerâ€™s Bundesliga.  Xherdan Shaqiri scored the only goal at the  Allianz Arena 
in Munich to give Bayern 84 points, three more than Dortmund had
last season. It was also the 27th win for the Bundesliga
champion, breaking the mark set by the club in 1972-73 and
matched by Dortmund last year.  Bayern made 10 changes to the team which beat Barcelona 4-0
in their Champions League semifinal opener four days ago. The
return match is in  Spain  on May 1, with Bayern seeking its third
Champions League final appearance in four seasons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
