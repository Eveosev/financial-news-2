Nate Robinson had 34 points to lead
the  Chicago Bulls  to a 142-134 triple overtime win against the
Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the National Basketball
Association playoffs.  The Bulls, who lost the first game in the best-of-seven
series, have won three in a row and can advance to the next
round with a victory tomorrow at Brooklyn. They rallied from 14
points down on Robinson’s 12-0 streak that he said reminded him
of a video game.  “I always think I’m on fire, kind of like the old school
game NBA Jam,” Robinson told reporters. “You make a couple in
a row, the rim’s on fire. You shoot the ball, the ball’s on
fire. I feel like that at times -- all the time. Whenever I’m in
the game, I just play with a lot of confidence. You kind of have
to lie to yourself and feel like you can’t miss.”  In other games yesterday, the Memphis Grizzlies routed the
Los Angeles Clippers 104-83 to even their series at 2-2, the
Atlanta Hawks defeated the Pacers 90-69 to trail 2-1, and the
Oklahoma City Thunder, playing without  Russell Westbrook , took a
3-0 lead with a 104-101 win over the Houston Rockets.  During today’s games, the Miami Heat seek to sweep their
series with the Milwaukee Bucks; the Knicks can eliminate the
 Boston Celtics ; the  San Antonio Spurs  can take their series 4-0
against the  Los Angeles Lakers  with a win; and the Denver
Nuggets will try to even their series 2-2 against the Golden
State Warriors.  Bulls Win  On home court at United Center, the Bulls had a 58-55
halftime lead before the Nets outscored them 29-18 in the third
quarter. Brooklyn led by 14 points with three minutes, 45
seconds left in the game.  Robinson then went on his own 12-0 run to bring the Bulls
within two with one minute, 10 seconds remaining, before  Carlos Boozer  tied the game at 109-109.  The Nets’ Brook Lopez hit two free throws with 33 seconds
left and Joakim Noah’s layup tied the game 111-111 to end
regulation play.  “We made a lot of mistakes up 14,” said the Nets’ Deron Williams. “It was so long ago, I can’t remember what all went
on. We had the missed dunk. Missed free throws. I fouled Nate on
the 3. We made a lot of mistakes in the fourth quarter.”  Boozer had 21 points for the Bulls, and Kirk Hinrich added
18.  Williams scored 32 points for the Nets and Lopez added 26
points and 11 rebounds.  Grizzlies Catch-up  At FedExForum in Memphis,  Zach Randolph  and  Marc Gasol  each
scored 24 points as the Grizzlies routed the Los Angeles
Clippers 104-83 to even their playoff series at 2-2.  The Grizzlies trailed 47-46 at the half and then outscored
the Clippers 25-20 in the third quarter and 33-16 in the final
period.  Blake Griffin  had 19 points and 10 rebounds and  Chris Paul 
added 19 points for the Clippers, who host Game 5 on April 30.  At Philips Arena in Atlanta,  Al Horford  had 26 points and
16 rebounds as the Hawks won their first playoff game to trail
the series against the Pacers 2-1.  The Hawks can even the series during a home game tomorrow.  David West  led the Pacers with 18 points followed by  Paul
George  with 16 points.  At Toyota Center in Houston,  Kevin Durant  had 41 points and
14 rebounds and Serge Ibaka added 17 points and 11 rebounds as
the Thunder came within one game of sweeping the Rockets.  The Thunder, holder of the best regular-season record in
the Western Conference, owned a 66-49 halftime advantage.  Westbrook will miss the rest of the playoffs after
undergoing knee surgery yesterday. He tore cartilage in his
right knee in Game 2 of the Thunder’s first-round series on
April 24.  A timetable for the three-time All-Star’s return will be
determined during the offseason, the Thunder said in a
statement.  Westbrook averaged 23.2 points per game during the regular
season, sixth-best in the league and second on the team to
Durant. He also contributed 7.4 assists per game, 1.8 steals and
a career-high 5.2 rebounds.  James Harden  led the Rockets with 30 points followed by
Chandler Parsons who scored 21 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
