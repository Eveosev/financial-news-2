An Asian online bidder last night
paid $36,750 for an evening in Barcelona with Ferran Adria, the
chef of El Bulli, winner of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants
title a record five times.  Bottles of DRC  Romanee Conti  fetched more than $50,000 at
Sotheby’s El Bulli Wine Cellar event in New York. The sale was
the second half of an auction that raised $2.7 million for the
nonprofit foundation being built on the site of the Spanish
restaurant, which closed in 2011.  The evening for four with Adria in Barcelona was the last
of more than 600 lots of wine and kitchen equipment from the
Catalan, Michelin three-star restaurant.  The successful bidder paid more than $9,000 a head for
gastronomic conversation with the chef in a test kitchen before
dinner at his brother’s tapas restaurant. The evening event had
been estimated at $5,000, based on hammer prices. A similar
package raised HK$220,500 ($28,400) in  Hong Kong .  Sotheby’s (BID)  said that the most expensive item was the 4-bottle lot of DRC Romanee Conti, the most desirable of
Burgundies. From the 2004 vintage and with labels signed by
Adria and El Bulli’s director Juli Soler, this sold to an Asian
private bidder for $52,062, more than doubling its low estimate
of $19,000.  Above-estimate results were helped by the charity
dimension. Last night’s total of $913,605 with fees exceeded the
$515,300 to $768,250 estimate, with 93 percent of the lots
finding buyers. The first half, in Hong Kong on April 3,
contributed $HK14.1 million.  Building Cost  Sotheby’s auctions will offset the projected 6 million
euros to build the El Bulli Foundation, devoted to gastronomic
research and creativity. It is planned to open in 2015.  “With these sales the dream becomes a reality,” Adria said
after the auction, according to a Sotheby’s e-mailed statement.  More than 1 million people applied each year for the 8,000
places at El Bulli’s tables. Diners enjoyed Adria’s 48-course
tasting menu with signature delicacies such as gin snow, nitro-caipirinha with tarragon concentrate, an exploding mimetic
olive, hare “blood” and fruit kebab.  Muse highlights include  New York  and London  weekend guides ,
 Warwick Thompson  on London theater,  Jeremy Gerard  on New York
theater,  Lewis Lapham  on history and  Craig Seligman  and  Greg
Evans  on film.  To contact the writer on the story:
