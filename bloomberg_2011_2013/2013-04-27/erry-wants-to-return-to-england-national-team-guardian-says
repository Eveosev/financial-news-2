Former England captain  John Terry 
wants to return to the national team and is eyeing a place at
the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, the Guardian reported.  Terry, 32, retired from international soccer last September
as he faced a Football Association hearing for racially abusing
QPR’s Anton Ferdinand in a Premier League match. He’d earlier
been acquitted of the charge in a London court, but was still
suspended four games and fined 200,000 pounds ($309,000) by the
F.A. after the hearing.  With F.A. Chairman  David Bernstein  due to step down in
July, Terry, who made 78 appearances for England, is keen to
reverse his decision to retire, the newspaper said. The defender
refused to shake hands with Bernstein last week at a Champions
League ceremony.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
