Two Iranians have been sentenced to
death for repeated consumption of alcohol,  Agence France-Presse 
reported citing Hassan Shariati, the head of the judiciary in
Iran’s northeastern province of Khorasan.  The individuals, who weren’t identified, had been sentenced
to lashings two previous times for consuming alcohol, AFP said.
The death sentence has been confirmed by the  Supreme Court ,
though under Iranian law the convicts will be spared if they
repent, it said.  One glass of alcohol is punishable by 80 lashes and a death
sentence may be handed if a person is caught drinking for the
third time, AFP said. The last such sentence was in 2007 when
the person condemned was pardoned after repenting, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
