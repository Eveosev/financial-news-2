Equatorial Guinea  will increase
exports of its Zafiro crude for August to four cargoes, one more
than July, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The August program of Zafiro includes one shipment that was
deferred from end-July, according to the plan. The country will
also export two cargoes each of Ceiba and Aseng grades, separate
schedules showed.  Exports of  Chad â€™s Doba blend will be three consignments in
August, one less than next month, while  Ghana  will keep its
loadings of Jubilee unchanged at two shipments, according to
shipping plans.  Zafiro and Ceiba exports are for 1 million barrels and the
other grades are in 950,000-barrel lots.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
