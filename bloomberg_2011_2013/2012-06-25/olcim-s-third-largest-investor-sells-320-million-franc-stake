Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) ’s third-largest
investor, The Capital Group Companies, sold a 320 million-franc
($333 million) stake in the Swiss maker of cement on June 20,
reducing the impact of a fine imposed on Indian operations.  The asset manager now owns 2.96 percent, Jona-based Holcim
said in a press release today. That’s down from 4.9 percent as
of Sept. 13, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Holcim shares fell as much as 3.9 percent on June 22, after
 India ’s competition commission fined two of Holcim’s
subsidiaries a combined 390 million francs. The Capital Group
Companies share sale was completed on June 20, according to a
statement from the Swiss SIX stock exchange.  Holcim and The Capital Group Companies didn’t give a reason
for the sale. Former Holcim chairman Thomas Schmidheiny and
Russian cement-maker Eurocement Holding AG, controlled by
billionaire Filaret Galchev, are Holcim’s largest shareholders
controlling about 30 percent of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
