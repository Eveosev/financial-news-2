Germany ’s 335 billion-euro ($420
billion) transition to renewable energy such as wind and solar
power may only be financed to 50 percent, with limited chances
of finding bank financing for the rest,  Die Welt  reported,
citing a report by  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s German division HVB Group.  Funding will be forthcoming for wind power turbines on land
and solar energy on roofs, which would account for half of the
new energy sources in the transition due to be completed by
2030, the report said, according to Die Welt.  Banks have a limited ability to provide funding for
offshore wind power, electricity grids and reserve power plants
because of the risks, Welt said, citing the HVB study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
