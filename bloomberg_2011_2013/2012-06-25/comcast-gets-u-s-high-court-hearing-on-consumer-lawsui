The U.S. Supreme Court will consider
whether customers can pursue an $875 million consumer lawsuit
alleging that  Comcast Corp., (CMCSA)  the nationâ€™s largest cable
television operator, monopolized the Philadelphia market.  The justices today agreed to review a federal appeals court
ruling that said the case could proceed as a class action on
behalf of as many as 2 million area customers.  A federal judge in April cleared the suit to go to trial on
some claims, including allegations that Comcast swapped
territories and subscribers with its competitors to ensure it
could control the Philadelphia market and charge higher prices.
Comcast has denied the allegations.  The justices will consider whether a federal judge can
certify the case as a class-action lawsuit without first
resolving whether proof of damages can be determined for the
plaintiffs as a group.  The case is Comcast v. Behrend, 11-864.  To contact the reporter on this story:
