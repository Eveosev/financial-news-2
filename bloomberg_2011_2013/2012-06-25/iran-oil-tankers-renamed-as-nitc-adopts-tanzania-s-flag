NITC, an oil-tanker company owned by
Iranian pension funds, renamed at least 10 of its vessels and
switched them to a Tanzanian flag amid increasing curbs on
transactions with the Persian Gulf nation.  NITC renamed five very large crude carriers, each holding
about 2 million barrels of oil, and five Suezmaxes, hauling 1
million barrels, according to the  Equasis  shipping database
maintained by the European Commission. Ownership was switched
from NITC to new companies operating from the same address in
Tehran and NITC remains the operator, the data show. All the
ships were previously registered in Malta or Cyprus.  A full European embargo on Iranian crude exports, which
starts July 1, extends to insuring vessels that carry the oil.
Twenty-five NITC tankers are being used to store crude, the
Paris-based  International Energy Agency  said June 13. The U.S.
and  Europe  said  Iran’s nuclear program  is aimed at developing
atomic weapons while the government in Tehran says it is for
civilian purposes.  Habibolah Seyedan, NITC’s commercial director, was
unavailable for comment, said a person who answered a call to
his office today. The company lists 39 tankers on its website.
Philtex Corp. operates the administrative office of the  Tanzania
Zanzibar International Register of Shipping  from Dubai,
according to the register’s website. A message to the listed e-
mail address for enquiries wasn’t immediately answered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
