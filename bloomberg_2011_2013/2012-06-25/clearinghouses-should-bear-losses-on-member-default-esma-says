Derivative clearinghouses should use
their own capital to cover losses when members can’t meet their
obligations to prevent “a default waterfall,”  Europe ’s top
markets regulator said today.  About 50 percent of central counterparties’ capital should
be earmarked to cover losses before non-defaulting members need
to step in to prevent a collapse, the  European Securities and
Markets Authority  said in a report today. The regulator also
proposed measures such as tougher collateral requirements and
increased trade reporting.  The proposals are part of an overhaul of rules governing
derivatives contracts in Europe that are scheduled to be
implemented by the end of the year. Global regulators have
sought tougher rules for over-the-counter derivatives since the
collapse in 2008 of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the rescue
of American International Group Inc., two of the largest traders
of credit-default swaps.  Over-the-counter derivatives affect “both financial
markets and the real economy, but have not been subject to
regulatory requirements,” Steven Maijoor, ESMA chairman, said
in an e-mailed statement. “This absence has resulted in
negative consequences for financial markets, investors and the
real economy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
