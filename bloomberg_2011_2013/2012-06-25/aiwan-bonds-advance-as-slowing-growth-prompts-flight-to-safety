Taiwan ’s dollar fell for a third day
as investors favored safer assets after data showed the island’s
economy is slowing.  Government bonds  were little changed.  Taiwan’s  export orders  slumped for a third month in May,
and the jobless rate climbed, according to government reports
last week. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares declined for a
third day before  Italy  and Spain hold bond auctions tomorrow and
European leaders meet this week to discuss strategies to contain
the region’s financial crisis. The yield on Taiwan’s benchmark
10-year bonds has dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, in the past two months.  “Taiwan’s economy is very much export-oriented, and we
haven’t seen any good economic data out recently,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Uni-President Assets
Management Corp., who helps manage $1.6 billion of fixed-income
assets. “The room for yields to go down further is a bit
limited” after the recent rally, he said.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.995 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, fell six basis points to 4.55 percent.  The yield on the 1.25 percent securities maturing in March
2022 was little changed at 1.204 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending rate  slipped
one basis point to 0.507 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
