Alejandro Falla of  Colombia  upset
American John Isner in an opening round match at the Wimbledon
tennis tournament.  Falla defeated the 11th seed 6-4, 6-7 (7-9), 3-6, 7-6
(9-7), 7-5. The American had 31 aces to Fallo’s 4, and his 76
winners were almost double Fallo’s. Three years ago, Falla came
within five points of knocking then-defending champion Federer
out of the opening round of Wimbledon.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
