The U.S.  Supreme Court  didn’t rule
on President  Barack Obama ’s health-care law today, pushing the
decision to June 28, when the justices plan to complete their
nine-month term.  The health-care ruling will determine the fate of Obama’s
signature domestic achievement and promises to be one of the
court’s most significant decisions in decades.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the biggest
overhaul of the U.S. health-care system since the enactment of
Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, is designed to extend coverage to
at least 30 million uninsured Americans and would reshape an
industry that makes up about 18 percent of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
