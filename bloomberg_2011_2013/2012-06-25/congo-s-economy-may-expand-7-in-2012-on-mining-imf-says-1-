The  International Monetary Fund  said
the economy of the  Democratic Republic  of Congo may expand 7
percent in 2012, higher than the government’s estimate, while
inflation will probably stay under 10 percent.  The central African country should increase its foreign-
currency reserves, which covered eight weeks’ worth of import
requirements at the end of 2011, to help reduce the country’s
vulnerability to external shocks, the Washington-based lender
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Congo is  Africa ’s second-largest producer of copper and the
source of about half of the world’s cobalt. The government is
targeting economic growth of 6 percent this year, down from 7
percent in 2011. Inflation averaged 8.79 percent in the year
through June, according to the central bank.  IMF officials gave the assessment after meeting with
authorities during a two-week trip in Kinshasa, the capital, to
review the country’s $561 million loan agreement. The IMF
delayed loan payments to Congo worth about $160 million after
the government failed to publish details of mining asset sales
last year.  “Continued progress in governance and transparency in the
extractive industries” could result in IMF officials requesting
the money be released by the board at its September meetings,
the IMF said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
