Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  of  Austria  fell,
leading the steepest drop for Czech shares in almost six weeks,
as investors sold financial stocks before a meeting of European
leaders this week to stem the regionâ€™s financial crisis.  The shares slid 2.5 percent to 362.5 koruna by 9:39 a.m. in
Prague. The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index, in which Erste has a 19
percent weighting, dropped 1.3 percent to 888.10, its biggest
slump since May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
