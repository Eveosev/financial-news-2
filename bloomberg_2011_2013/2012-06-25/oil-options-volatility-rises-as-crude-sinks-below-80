Crude-oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures fell below $80 a barrel a third day on
concern that a meeting this week of European leaders will fail
to keep the region’s debt crisis from worsening.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 33.6 percent at 3:50 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 32.7 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for August delivery fell 55 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $79.21 a barrel on the Nymex.  Oil also fell as Tropical Storm Debby moved slowly in the
 Gulf of Mexico  off the  Florida Panhandle  without posing a threat
to oil facilities along the  Gulf Coast , equities weakened and
the dollar gained. The dollar rose 0.6 percent against the euro
at 3:37 p.m. in  New York  and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
 slipped  1.6 percent.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were August $92 calls, which were unchanged at 11 cents a barrel
at 3:38 p.m. with 2,545 lots trading. September $75 puts were
the second-most active options, with 2,032 lots changing hands
as they advanced 6 cents to $2.37.  Bearish Bets  Calls accounted for 63 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 60 percent of the 120,532
contracts traded in the previous session. August $65 puts were
the most actively traded, with 9,163 lots changing hands. They
