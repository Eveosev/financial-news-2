New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, declined for a fourth day as fuel
prices fell on concern that Europe’s debt crisis and  China ’s
economic slowdown will curb demand.  The stock dropped 1.5 percent to 98.75 koruna by 1:10 p.m.
in  Prague , poised for its longest stretch of losses since the
seven-day rout ended May 21. Europe’s benchmark  coal  derivatives
slid 1.5 percent to $97.25 a metric ton in the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
