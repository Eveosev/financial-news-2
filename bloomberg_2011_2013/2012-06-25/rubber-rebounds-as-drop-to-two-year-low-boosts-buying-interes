Rubber jumped by the most in a week
as its slump to the lowest level in more than two years
attracted buyers amid speculation that  China , the biggest
consumer, will take measures to boost its economy.  The November-delivery contract advanced as much as 3.7
percent to 240.2 yen a kilogram ($2,998 a metric ton) before
settling at 237.3 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange. The most-
active contract has plunged 27 percent this quarter, the most
since the final three months of 2008. It has lost 9.9 percent in
the first half, touching a low of 227.8 yen.  China’s central bank may cut the reserve-requirement ratio
for lenders “soon” and use reverse repurchase agreements to
alleviate a possible capital shortage in July, China Securities
Journal reported, citing unnamed analysts.  “Futures advanced on optimism that China will stimulate
the economy,” Sureerat Kunthongjun, an analyst at AGROW
Enterprise Ltd., said by phone from Bangkok.  Rubber also climbed as the Japanese currency traded at a
two-month low against the dollar, making yen-denominated
contracts more attractive to investors, said  Kazuhiko Saito , an
analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  September-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost 1 percent to close at 22,335  yuan  ($3,510) a ton. Natural-
rubber inventories gained 846 tons to 17,988 tons, based on a
survey of nine warehouses in China, the bourse said on June 21.  Thai rubber on a  free-on-board basis  dropped 1.7 percent to
103.10 baht ($3.24) a kilogram today as production improved
after rains subsided, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  The country’s Rubber Estate Organization will  cut the price 
it buys ribbed-smoked sheets from farmers by 2.6 percent to
92.50 baht a kilogram on June 26. That’s higher than the average
auctioned price in three southern markets of 90.59 baht, the
organization said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
