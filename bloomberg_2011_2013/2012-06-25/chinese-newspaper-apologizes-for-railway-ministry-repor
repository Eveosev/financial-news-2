The  Economic Observer , a weekly
newspaper in Beijing, retracted and issued a public apology for
a June 16 story that claimed the  Railway Ministry  may lose
control of some functions.  The apology, dated June 19 and published on the front page
of today’s newspaper, said the story was “not in line with
facts,” and was based on “the views of experts and online
bulletin board information.” It said the reporter who wrote the
story never contacted the ministry for comment.  The article, published last week, said the ministry may
lose control of investment, construction and railway operations.
It said the ministry would establish and inject assets into
three new companies, which would be overseen by the State-Owned
Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. The story
cited railway officials, executives at state-owned enterprises
and sources in “relevant ministries.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
