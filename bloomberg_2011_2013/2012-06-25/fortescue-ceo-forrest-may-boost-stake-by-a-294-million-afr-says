Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG)  Chief
Executive Officer  Andrew Forrest  may be seeking to buy A$294
million ($294 million) of shares in the iron-ore miner through
Morgan Stanley, the Australian Financial Review reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Morgan Stanley has contacted fund managers with a proposal
to buy 60 million shares, or 1.9 percent of the issued stock, at
A$4.90 apiece, the newspaper said in its Street Talk column.
That’s a 4.9 percent premium over the 20-day average price.  Forrest, Australia’s third-richest man according to Forbes
magazine, is already Fortescue’s biggest shareholder with a 31
percent stake, according to the company’s website. Yvonne Ball,
a spokeswoman for Perth-based Fortescue, declined to comment on
a possible share transaction or the identity of any buyer.  Fortescue fell 1.2 percent to close at A$4.85 in Sydney
trading. The  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  declined 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
