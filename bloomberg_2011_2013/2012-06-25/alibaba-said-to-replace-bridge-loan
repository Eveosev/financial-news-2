Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $3
billion loan is being funded today as the borrower replaces a $2
billion bridge portion of that facility with longer-term debt,
and seeks an additional $1 billion in financing, two people
familiar with the matter said.  Alibaba is in talks with international lenders for an
additional $1 billion four-year loan after signing a $3 billion
facility with a syndicate of 19 banks on June 12. That $3
billion financing included a $2 billion bridge loan.  “We got more permanent financing so we no longer need to
have the bridge loan,” said John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Alibaba. “This is one of the most successful
syndications the market has seen, especially in these volatile
market conditions.”  The bridge facility may be replaced by three- and four-year
loans from China Development Bank Corp., two other people
familiar with the matter said on June 20.  The short-term financing was canceled before the funds were
utilized by the borrower and the syndicate of banks will receive
25 percent of the original upfront fees on the bridge, the
people who spoke today said, asking not to be identified because
the details are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
