Hans Neuendorf, the 74-year-old
founder of the art-market-data provider  Artnet AG (ART) , will be
succeeded as chief executive officer by his eldest son Jacob Pabst, the company said in a statement sent by e-mail today.  Pabst, who is 39, has worked for Artnet since 2000, the
company said. Since January, he has headed the  New York  office,
overseeing 120 employees. He also introduced the company’s
online auctions and analytics reports allowing users to rank the
performance of art as an asset, according to the statement.
Pabst takes over effective July 1.  “He knows the company, the market and the customers,”
John Hushon, head of Artnet’s supervisory board, said in the
statement. “He will bring new momentum and help Artnet make
progress.”  Neuendorf, who also co-founded the  Art Cologne  fair in
1967, will stay on as a consultant. Artnet operates a  website 
comprising a database of prices for art sold at auction, as well
as the online auctions and analytics reports.  Muse highlights include Hephzibah Anderson on books and
 John Mariani  on wine.  To contact the reporter on the story:
