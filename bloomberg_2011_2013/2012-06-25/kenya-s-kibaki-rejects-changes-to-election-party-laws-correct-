Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki
rejected parliamentary changes to election and party laws that
were drawn up under a new constitution aimed at ending violence
after a 2007 election.  Lawmakers in the East African nation voted June 22 to
repeal provisions that would have barred sitting members of
parliament from changing parties and let a losing candidate be
nominated into a lower public office than the one they
contested. Parliament also wanted electoral candidates to have a
university degree.  “In keeping with the doctrine of the separation of powers,
matters which are before the court should not be the subject of
legislation,” Kibaki said in an e-mailed statement today in
Nairobi, the capital. Politicians have already sued against the
laws parliament voted to change, he said.  Kenya ,  East Africa ’s largest economy and the world’s
biggest exporter of black tea, holds its next national election
on March 4. Vote-rigging allegations in the previous poll in
December 2007 triggered ethnic and political clashes that killed
1,133 people and forced 350,000 to flee their homes.  As part of an agreement to end the conflict, Kenya created
a power-sharing government and drew up a new constitution to
address legal deficiencies and loopholes.  Two potential presidential contenders, Deputy Prime
Minister Uhuru Kenyatta and former Higher Education Minister
 William Ruto , are facing trial at the  International Criminal
Court  on charges of crimes against humanity related to the
violence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
