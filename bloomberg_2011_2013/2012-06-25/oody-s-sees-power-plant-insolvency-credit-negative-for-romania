 Hidroelectrica SA’s insolvency is
credit negative for  Romania  because the government delayed its
planned sale and may have to pay part of the utility’s debt,
Moody’s Investors Service said.  “This sudden filing for insolvency by a government-owned
entity reflects negatively on the sovereign’s credit profile
with precedent-setting uncertainty for creditors and other
commercial partners of other Romanian state-owned entities,
which number in the hundreds,” said Atsi Sheth, a senior
analyst at the ratings company, in Moody’s Weekly Credit Outlook
today.  The delay of the sale of a stake in the hydropower
generator may raise market skepticism about future asset sales,
which are key to Romania’s agreements with international lenders
and are designed to improve efficiency in state-owned
enterprises “via private-sector participation,” according to
Moody’s.  Moody’s rates Romania Baa3, the lowest investment grade,
with a stable outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
