Bank of Montreal , Canada’s fourth-
largest lender by assets, will close 24 U.S. branches as it
continues integrating its C$4.1 billion ($3.98 billion) takeover
of Marshall & Ilsley Corp.  The lender will close 17 BMO Harris Bank branches in
Wisconsin, five in Indiana and one each in Illinois and Kansas,
Jim Kappel, a spokesman for the Toronto-based bank, said today
in a telephone interview.  “The closures are primarily due to an overlap in the
network,” Kappel said. “In some instances there were branches
right across the street from one another.”  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  has been integrating its Chicago-based BMO
Harris Bank business with M&I since completing its takeover of
the Milwaukee-based lender in July. The closures, which will
happen by October, affect 130 employees and the bank is working
to find new positions for them, Kappel said.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  has announced the closing of 43 branches
since completing its M&I takeover, with 20 of those already
under way prior to the acquisition, Kappel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
