Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
gained the most in five months in New York after a U.S. court
ruled that competitors won’t be able to sell generic versions of
Copaxone, the Israeli drugmaker’s best-selling medicine.  American depositary receipts of Teva, the world’s largest
generic drugmaker, surged 4.5 percent to $39.72 by the close in
New York, the sharpest increase since Jan 3. The shares declined
2.5 percent to 158.9 shekels in  Tel Aviv , or the equivalent of
$40.51, after rising the most in 12 years yesterday.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan ruled that
patents on Copaxone, the multiple sclerosis medicine that made
up  21 percent  of Teva’s revenue in 2011, are valid, the company
said in a statement distributed by  Business Wire  on June 23.
Teva had sued Novartis AG, Mylan Inc. and  Momenta
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA) , saying their attempts to seek permission
to sell Copaxone copies infringed on patents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
