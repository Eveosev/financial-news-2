Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  fell on speculation a meeting of European Union leaders
this week will fail to check the region’s debt crisis.  American Depositary Receipts  of Canon Inc., a Japanese
camera maker that depends on Europe for almost a third of its
sales, lost 1.4 percent from the closing share price in  Tokyo .
Shares of U-Shin Ltd. may be active on a report the autoparts
maker will pay as much as 30 billion yen ($377 million) for
Valeo SA’s auto key business. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,
Australia’s largest oil producer, slid 1.4 percent after crude
prices fell.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,640 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,720
in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,630 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index sank 0.9 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.1 percent in Wellington.  “There’s increasing concern that the EU summit won’t work
out concrete measures to overcome the debt crisis as there has
been no change in Germany’s resistance to euro-zone debt
sharing,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based
SMBC Friend Securities Co. “The yen is strengthening and that
hurts exporters.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index declined 1.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday on concern this week’s European summit will fail to
tame a crisis that put American earnings on pace for the first
decline since 2009.  Merkel Resists  Chancellor Angela Merkel  hardened her resistance to euro-
area debt sharing, setting Germany on a collision course with
its allies at a summit starting on June 28.  In signs the debt crisis is worsening, Cyprus said it will
seek a financial lifeline from the euro area’s firewall funds,
and Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras consented to the
resignation of his finance minister, Vassilios Rapanos.  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded 28 Spanish banks,
citing the country’s sovereign debt and rising losses on real-
estate loans. The lenders’ long-term debt and deposit ratings
were cut by one to four notches, Moody’s said yesterday in a
statement. The New York-based rating company also downgraded 16
Spanish banks on May 17.  The European currency weakened before this week’s summit
and as Italy and Spain prepare to sell debt today amid concern
Europe’s fiscal crisis is infecting bigger economies.  The euro fell to as low as 99.48 yen today, compared with
100.41 yen at the close of  stock trading  yesterday. The dollar
depreciated to as low as 79.58 from 80.17 yen. A stronger yen
cuts the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  Oil Drops  Oil fell below $80 a barrel for a third day in New York.
Crude oil for August delivery declined 0.7 percent to settle at
$79.21 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
equities in the U.S slipped 2.7 percent to 87.91 in New York
yesterday, the lowest closing level since June 5.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 0.3 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 4.5 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 0.7 percent drop by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.6 times for the S&P 500
and 10.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
