Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  may spend
about $20 billion to buy the rest of Grupo Modelo SAB, Mexicoâ€™s
biggest brewer, according to a person with knowledge of the
matter.  The amount is the enterprise value for the transaction and
would include a premium for Modelo as well as a payment to
 Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ)  to buy a stake in a distribution joint
venture, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the matter is private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
