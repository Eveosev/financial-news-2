Japanese  stocks  dropped for a second
day as opposition to a tax increase mounted among lawmakers
before a key vote tomorrow and the yen strengthening. Drops were
limited as European leaders agreed to cooperate on a regional
growth plan ahead of a summit this week.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that earns almost a third of
its revenue from  North America , sank 2.7 percent.  Renesas
Electronics Corp. (6723)  lost 2.7 percent after the Nikkei newspaper
reported the chipmaker may sell 50 billion yen ($622 million) in
new shares. Fanuc Corp., a producer of automation controls for
Chinese factories, lost 1.6 percent after China’s economic
growth estimate was cut by Citigroup Inc.  Hosokawa Micron (6277)  Corp.,
a machine maker that gets 32 percent of its sales in Europe,
advanced 1.2 percent.  “Investors are in a wait-and-see mode,” said  Naoki
Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6.5 billion at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “Events such the European leaders’
meeting and Japan’s consumption tax talks are happening this
week so investors can’t take positions until we know how they
will go. ”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.7 percent to 8,734.62
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo after earlier rising as much as 0.5
percent. Volume was more than 25 percent below the 30-day
average. The broader Topix Index slid 0.8 percent to 745.22.  Japanese stocks extended declines after China’s 2012
economic growth estimate reduced to 7.8 percent from 8.1 percent
by Citigroup to reflect slowing domestic activity in the second
quarter and further weakening of European demand.  Fanuc slid 1.6 percent to 12,620 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a
construction machinery maker that gets 14 percent of its sales
in China, slipped 1.2 percent to 1,866 yen.  Tax Battle  About 50 Japanese lawmakers from the ruling  Democratic
Party  of Japan will likely vote tomorrow against proposed social
security and tax reform legislation, the Nikkei newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information. The split
threatens to break up the ruling party.  “Unless the consumption tax is raised, the government’s
fiscal situation will get tighter,  interest rates  will increase
and the yen will strengthen,” said Shinkin Asset’s Fujiwara.
“That’s not good for markets. If the consumption tax is raised,
it may slightly drag down the economy, but that’s less of a
shock than not doing it.”  The  Topix (MXAP)  has fallen 15 percent from its peak on March 27
on concern the debt crisis in Europe is spreading and as growth
in the U.S. and China slows. Stocks on the gauge are valued at
0.88 times book value, with a number below one meaning a company
can be bought for less than the value of its assets.  Among companies that fell, Renesas Electronics lost 2.7
percent to 325 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported the
chipmaker may sell new shares to private equity firm KKR & Co.  Euro Falls  The euro fell toward the lowest in more than a week before
Italy and Spain sell debt tomorrow amid concern  Europe ’s fiscal
crisis is infecting larger economies in the bloc. The yen
appreciated to as high as 110.42 against the euro today in Tokyo,
compared with 101.02 when stock opened trading this morning.
Against the dollar, the Japanese currency strengthened to as
high as 80.11 yen from 80.58. A stronger yen cuts overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Nissan, which generates about 80 percent of its revenue
overseas, sank 2.7 percent to 728 yen.  Canon Inc. (7731) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, slid 2.5 percent to 3,170 yen.  Some stocks linked with Europe gained after Germany, Italy,
France and Spain agreed in Rome on June 22 to cooperate on a
growth plan of as much as 130 billion euros ($163 billion) for
the 17-nation bloc. French President  Francois Hollande  and
Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  have been pushing for a
collectively financed stimulus plan. The summit will begin June
28 in Brussels.  Hosokawa Micron  Hosokawa Micron climbed 1.2 percent to 425 yen. Olympus
Corp., an optical-equipment maker that generates almost a fifth
of its sales in Europe, added 0.8 percent to 1,206 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.5
percent today. The index rose 0.7 percent in New York on June 22
as bank downgrades from Moody’s Investors Service were no worse
than the firm had warned. The ratings firm cut Morgan Stanley by
two levels rather than a threatened three grades. Banks rose the
most among the 24 industry groups on the equity gauge.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto in Tokyo. Editors:  Jim Powell , Jason Clenfield  To contact the reporter on this story:
