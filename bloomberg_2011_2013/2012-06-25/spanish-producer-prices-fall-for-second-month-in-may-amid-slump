Spanish  producer prices  fell in May
for the second month as the sovereign-debt crisis deepened the
 recession  in the euro areaâ€™s fourth-biggest economy.  Prices of goods leaving factories, mines and refineries
fell 0.1 percent from the prior month, when they declined 0.8
percent, the  National Statistics Institute  in Madrid said today.
Prices gained 3.2 percent from a year ago.  Spain  is implementing the steepest budget cuts in at least
three decades to rein in the  deficit , which at 8.9 percent of
gross domestic product last year was similar to that of Greece.
The economy is suffering its second recession since 2009,
pushing the jobless rate to more than 24 percent as Spaniards
scale back spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
