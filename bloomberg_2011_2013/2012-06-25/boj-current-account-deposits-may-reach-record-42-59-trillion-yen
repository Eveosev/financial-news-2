The  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s current-account
balance may climb to a record 42.59 trillion yen ($530 billion)
after the central bank refrained from conducting a money-market
operation at 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo .  The BOJ projects that deposits will climb by 490 billion
yen from last week to 42.59 trillion should the central bank
refrain from draining funds from the financial system later
today. The amount would exceed the previous BOJ deposit record
of 42.57 trillion yen set on March 24 last year following
Japan’s earthquake and tsunami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
