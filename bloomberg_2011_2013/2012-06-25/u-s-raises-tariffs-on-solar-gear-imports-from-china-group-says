The U.S. Commerce Department
determined that Chinese solar-product imports should be subject
to additional tariffs to offset government subsidies, according
to an agency document.  The department, which on May 17 announced anti-dumping
duties as high as 250 percent on imports from  China , found
additional state subsidies benefiting the nation’s producers,
Tim Truman, a department spokesman, said today in an e-mail.  The Commerce Department in March announced anti-subsidy
duties as high as 4.73 percent for the Chinese solar-energy
items. The revised determination in a June 22 memorandum would
increase the tariffs to 3.44 percent from 2.9 percent on imports
from  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , and to 5.81 percent from 4.73
percent on imports from  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , according to a
statement yesterday from the Coalition for American Solar
Manufacturing. The group, led by  SolarWorld AG (SWV) , represents
companies that produce solar-energy products in the U.S.  The agency’s tariff determinations are preliminary, and no
additional duties will be collected at the U.S. border as a
result of the new analysis, Truman said. A final decision is
scheduled for Oct. 10, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
