A widening contango structure in  oil
prices , in which future crude costs are higher than near-term
ones, may spur demand to store crude on tankers, said Fotis Giannakoulis, a Morgan Stanley analyst.  Brent crude futures for October cost about 33 cents a
barrel more than first-month contracts, compared with a discount
of about $2.44 in mid-May, according to ICE Futures  Europe .  Storage at sea may rise if the current contango widens to
about $1.30 a barrel, an amount that would cover the costs
involved in hiring tankers, Giannakoulis said in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
