Kenedix Inc. (4321) , a Japanese real estate
investment company, is set to win the bidding for a Tokyo
building that a  Morgan Stanley (MS)  real estate fund turned over to
lenders after failing to repay loans, according to two people
familiar with the transaction.  Kenedix bid about 51 billion yen ($637 million) in the sale
arranged by  Orix Corp. (8591)  and Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., according
to the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303)  relocated its
headquarters from the central Tokyo office building in 2011.  The Morgan Stanley real estate fund paid 118 billion yen
for the building in 2008 and turned the property over to lenders
last year after failing to repay loans on time. Deutsche Bank AG
lent the fund 92.7 billion yen for the purchase and sold off
72.7 billion yen of the loan to investors as mortgage-backed
securities, the Frankfurt-based bank said in a release
announcing the loan in July 2008.  Masahiko Tajima, a Tokyo-based Kenedix executive officer,
did not return calls seeking comment. Michio Nagano, a spokesman
at Mizuho Trust & Banking, and Naomi Shibuya, a spokeswoman at
Orix, declined to comment.  To contact the translator on this story:
