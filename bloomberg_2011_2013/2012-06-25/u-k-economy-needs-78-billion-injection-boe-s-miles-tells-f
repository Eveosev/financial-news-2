The  Bank of England  should put at
least 50 billion pounds ($78 billion) into Britain’s economy,
 David Miles , a member of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee,
told the Financial Times.  Miles said the country needs a “more expansionary monetary
policy,” adding that “exactly the right amount” can’t be
known in advance, the newspaper reported.  He said he could see no reason to blame public spending
cuts for the fact that the U.K. economy has performed worse than
the MPC forecast, citing unexpectedly high commodity prices as
being responsible, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
