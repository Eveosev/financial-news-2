PayLife Bank GmbH said it’s spinning
off its ATM unit to prepare a sale of its credit card business
by some of the Austrian banks that own it.  PayLife, owned by lenders including UniCredit Bank Austria
AG, Bawag PSK Bank AG,  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and Raiffeisen
Zentralbank Oesterreich AG, is carving out PSA Payment Services
Austria GmbH, which issues ATM cards and runs the ATM system in
Austria, as a separate company, PayLife said on its website
today. While PSA isn’t for sale, “several” of the company’s
owners want to sell their stakes in PayLife’s main business,
issuing Visa and Mastercard credit cards in the Alpine country,
it said.  PayLife authorized Erste and Bank Austria to seek a buyer
for the Austrian credit card company, Die Presse reported March
22. PayLife may sell for 250 million euros ($312 million) to 400
million euros, the Vienna-based paper said at the time.  Bank Austria owns 24 percent, Bawag 20.7 percent, Erste
20.5 percent, Raiffeisen 12.8 percent and Volksbanken 8.3
percent, according to PayLife’s website. Erste is interested in
selling, spokeswoman Karin Berger said in an e-mail today.
Raiffeisen is reviewing all options, according to spokesman
Andreas Ecker-Nakamura. Bank  Austria  spokesman Martin Halama
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
