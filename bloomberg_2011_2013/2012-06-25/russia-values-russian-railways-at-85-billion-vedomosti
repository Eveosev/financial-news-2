Russia’s government valued OAO
Russian Railways, the country’s rail monopoly, at about 2.8
trillion rubles ($85 billion), Vedomosti reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  That would value of the 25 percent minus one share that the
government plans to sell at 700 billion rubles, or more than
twice the 260 billion rubles estimated by the company itself,
the Moscow-based newspaper said today.  Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  last week signed a decree
ordering the government to sell the so-called blocking stake in
the state-run company by the end of next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
