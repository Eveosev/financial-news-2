(Corrects LaShawn Merritt’s time in ninth paragraph.)  Justin Gatlin, the 2004 Olympic gold
medalist, and former world champion Tyson Gay are headed to the
London games and a potential 100-meter matchup with Usain Bolt
after qualifying with quick times at the U.S. team trials.  Gatlin won the 100-meter final in 9.80 seconds yesterday at
the University of  Oregon  in Eugene, Oregon. It was the third-
best time in the world this year behind reigning Olympic
champion and world record-holder Bolt of  Jamaica , who ran 9.76
in  Rome  on May 31 and 9.79 in Oslo a week later.  Gatlin, 30, wasn’t able to defend his Olympic title at the
2008 Beijing Olympics while serving a four-year doping ban for
twice testing positive for banned substances.  “This season so far has been undefeated and just trying to
ride that wave,” Gatlin said in comments distributed by USA
Track and Field. “I have a lot left in the tank.”  Gay, 29, finished second in a time of 9.86 seconds and
qualified for the U.S. Olympic team after missing most of the
past year following hip surgery. Ryan Bailey is the third member
of the American 100-meter team after running 9.93 to beat
Michael Rodgers by one-hundredth of a second.  “I’m on my way up,” Gay said. “This is only my second
race of the year and I only started training in March.”  Walter Dix, the 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, finished
eighth after straining a muscle in his left leg during the
semifinals. Dix is also slated to run in the 200 meters starting
in four days.  Women’s Run-Off  The third women’s 100-meter spot may be decided by a run-
off after Jeneba Tarmoh and Allyson Felix finished in a dead
heat two days ago. The U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Track and
Field said yesterday that the runners have the option of
deciding who will join Carmelita Jeter and Tianna Madison by
either a  coin flip or a run-off  before the trials end July 1.  LaShawn Merritt will defend his 400-meter title in  London 
after winning yesterday’s final in 44.12 seconds to lower his
2012  world-best time . Merritt was cleared to compete in the
Olympic trials after receiving a two-year doping suspension, a
ban that was later reduced to 21 months. He’ll be joined on the
400-meter squad by Tony McQuay and Bryshon Nellum, while Jeremy Wariner failed to qualify with a sixth-place finish after
winning a gold medal in 2004 and a silver in 2008.  Sanya Richards-Ross, who was born in Jamaica and became a
U.S. citizen in 2002, won the women’s 400 meters in a time of
49.28. She’ll also seek to qualify in the 200 meters.  Former world champion shot-putter Reese Hoffa will head to
London after extending his season-best mark with a throw of 22
meters. He’s joined by Ryan Whiting and Christian Cantwell.  Stephanie Brown Trafton will defend her Olympic title in
the women’s discus, while Beijing silver medalist Jennifer Suhr
won the women’s pole vault event at the trials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
