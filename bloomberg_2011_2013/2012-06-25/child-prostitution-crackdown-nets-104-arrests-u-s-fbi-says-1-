A three-day U.S. crackdown on child
prostitution resulted in 104 arrests, the FBI said.  The operation, conducted June 21 to June 23 in 57 cities,
rescued 79 children as young as 13 years old being held against
their will and forced to work as prostitutes, said Kevin
Perkins, an FBI official, at a briefing today for reporters in
 Washington .  This is the sixth nationwide operation targeting child
prostitution coordinated by the  Federal Bureau of Investigation 
since 2008, Perkins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
