Most Hong Kong  stocks  fell, led by
energy and mining companies, as the  Bank for International
Settlements  said central banks are seeing the limits of their
ability to boost global growth.  The Hang Seng Index was little changed at 18,989.70 at
10:09 a.m. local time, with five stocks falling for every three
that rose on the 49-company gauge. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland stocks slid 0.8 percent to
9,431.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
