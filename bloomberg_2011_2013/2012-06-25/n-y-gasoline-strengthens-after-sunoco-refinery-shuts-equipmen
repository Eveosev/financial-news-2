New York gasoline strengthened after
 Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  shut equipment at its Philadelphia refinery.  The company shut a vacuum tower associated with a crude
unit at the 355,000-barrel-a-day refinery June 20, according to
a filing with city regulators.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York narrowed 0.5 cent to 7.13 cents a
gallon versus futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 3:13 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 8.09 cents to $2.5746 a gallon.  The differential for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago rose 4 cents to reach parity with futures.  BP Plc (BP)  returned a sulfur recovery train to service at its
Whiting, Indiana, refinery, according to a person with knowledge
of the situation. The train was shut after a fire June 21.  The premium in  Chicago  for ultra-low-sulfur diesel versus
heating oil futures fell 1.25 cents to 3.25 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
