Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (TSEM) , a maker of
customized chips, advanced the most in almost three weeks after
the company said it developed radiation-hard integrated circuits
with Italyâ€™s RedCat Devices.  The  shares  rose 2.8 percent, poised for the biggest gain
since June 6, to 2.91 shekels, at 12:25 p.m. in  Tel Aviv .  For Tower, the technology opens new markets which require
components that withstand high doses of radiation, including
medical devices, it said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
