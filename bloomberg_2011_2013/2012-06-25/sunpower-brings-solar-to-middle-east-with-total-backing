Being majority-owned by  Europe ’s
third-largest  oil company  will help  SunPower Corp. (SPWR)  bring solar
power to the Middle East.  Total SA (FP) , which owns 66 percent of SunPower, has close ties
to customers and suppliers in the Middle East and  Africa , and is
seeking to bundle fuel contracts with sales of SunPower solar
panels, SunPower Chief Executive Officer Thomas Werner said in a
phone interview June 22.  Total’s backing also gives San Jose, California-based
SunPower cheaper borrowing costs and more money to invest in
research while other solar companies must contend with a global
oversupply that’s driven down the price of  panels  42 percent in
the year since the oil company purchased its stake, Werner said.  “The investment was key to SunPower obviously not only
surviving, but thriving,” Werner said. “It increases the
likelihood that we’re one of the winners.”  Total is planning to test SunPower’s concentrating solar
panels at one of the oil company’s sites in the  Middle East , and
its relationships with energy companies in the region may lead
to panel-supply contracts, Werner said.  Saudi Arabia  is seeking investors for a $109 billion plan
to generate a third of its power from solar power by 2032.
Abundant sunshine may help countries in the region reduce their
reliance on domestic oil for generating electricity.  Total, based in Paris, is also offering solar panels to
customer such as mining companies that often have operations in
remote locations, far from the conventional  power grid , and rely
instead on diesel-power generation instead.  Personal Strategy  Total “can now offer mining companies another option --
solar panels instead of burning diesel,” Werner said. SunPower
is short-listed for a planned power project in  South Africa  at a
mining operation. “We wouldn’t have had that without Total.”  Total’s effort to integrate sales of solar power into its
other operations “is coming straight from the CEO,” Werner
said. Total Chairman and CEO Christophe de Margerie flew to
 California  and had dinner with SunPower’s CEO after the purchase
last year. The solar strategy is “personal for him and it sets
the tone for the whole company.”  “Having Total as a ‘big brother’ certainly helps from a
balance sheet standpoint, and supports SunPower’s efforts to win
future project business,”  Pavel Molchanov , an analyst at
Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston, said in an
interview.  Total paid $1.3 billion to acquire 60 percent of SunPower
in June 2011 at a premium of about 46 percent. SunPower shares
have declined 72 percent since then.  In December, Total agreed to pay $163.7 million to raise
its stake to 66 percent and SunPower took over its Tenesol
renewable-energy unit.  Cheaper Borrowing  Being part of Total brings SunPower a lower  cost of capital 
to finance large projects. Werner said his company’s borrowing
costs are about 1 percentage point lower than before the
acquisition. That cuts expenses by about $1 million to $10
million for each solar project. “It’s had a real impact.”  Total also provided $24 million for research and
development, funds that SunPower otherwise “would not have
spent,” Werner said.  He’s hiring engineers to design thinner
wafers and increase efficiency. “It’s allowed us to invest more
in the downturn for our next generation panel.”  SunPower is using Total’s support to develop more solar
farms, capital-intensive efforts that require a large balance
sheet.  “In an industry downcycle, if you can invest in R&D and
projects, and have more self-developed projects, you control
your own destiny,” Werner said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
