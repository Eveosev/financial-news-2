Spain is preparing a two-year budget
blueprint to counter concerns it will fall short of deficit
targets.  The government intends to “incorporate the essential of
what will be the 2014 budget, with a forecast of tax receipts,
the tax changes, the main measures and the priorities for
spending,” along with the 2013 plan in September, Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro told reporters in Madrid today.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has declined to answer calls
by the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Commission
to show how he’ll meet austerity goals. The IMF forecasts that
the country will miss its 5.3 percent of gross domestic product
target this year and warned against cutting too fast a deficit
similar to that of  Greece , at 8.9 percent of GDP, as it says the
economy will shrink again in 2013.  “Given the lack of detailed measures after 2012, staff
projects the deficit to significantly overshoot targets and to
fall only gradually over the medium term,” the Washington-based
lender said in a report on June 14.  Separately, the commission said in May that the country’s
national reform and stability programs, presented in April to
show how it plans to meet budget commitments, include “few
concrete measures” for 2014 and 2015.  Since Rajoy’s People’s Party government came to power in
December, 10-year borrowing costs have surged by 126 basis
points to 6.54 percent, with a 7.29 percent peak on June 18.
 Spain , the euro area’s fourth-biggest economy, also became its
fourth member to seek a rescue, making its formal request today.  An outline of the 2014 plan will be published with the 2013
budget draft, Montoro said. This usually takes place in
September. The spending limit for 2013 will be presented in July
in agreement with the commission, Montoro said.  European Union leaders meeting on June 28 and 29 in
Brussels may decide to give the nation a year more to reach the
EU limit of 3 percent of GDP. The 2012 budget aims to shrink the
budget gap by 40 percent amid a 1.7 percent recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
