Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the
country’s biggest lender by market value, advanced the most in
almost three months after announcing a dividend payment.  The  shares  rose 1.2 percent, the most since March 30, to
170 rupees by the close in Port Louis. The  38-member SEMDEX (SEMDEX) 
gauge climbed 0.5 percent, the most since May 16, to 1,789.23.  MCB, as the bank is known, announced late on June 22 the
payment of a  final dividend  of 3.25 rupees for fiscal 2012.
Total dividend for the 12 months ending June 30 will be 5.85
rupees, compared with 5.75 rupees last year,  data  compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The final dividend “implies that earnings will be similar
as last year,” said Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at city-
based Axys Stockbroking Ltd., in a phone interview today.
“Given the current conditions, it’s a laudable performance.”  Gilbert Gnany, group chief strategy officer at the Port
Louis-based lender, has cut its economic growth forecast to 3.4
percent this year from 3.6 percent, he said in a June 15 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
