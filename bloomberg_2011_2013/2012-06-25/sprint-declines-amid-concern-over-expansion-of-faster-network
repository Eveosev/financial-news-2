Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, declined the most in two months
amid concern over the management of its fourth-generation
network expansion.  About 250 employees that had been assigned to Ericsson AB
to help plan and oversee the network were reassigned back to
Sprint. The shift of employees was highlighted in a report today
by Detwiler Fenton & Co., which called the change a “black
eye” for Ericsson and a sign that Sprint may have had troubles
coordinating the work. Ericsson was hired as a contract partner
to handle Sprint’s network operation and expansion.  The carrier is playing catch-up with  Verizon Wireless  and
 AT&T Inc. (T)  in building out a network with long term evolution, or
LTE, technology. Sprint also has a $15.5 billion contract with
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to sell the iPhone, which is adding pressure to
upgrade the network. Analysts expect the next iPhone, due later
this year, to feature LTE.  Sprint shares  fell 6.1 percent at $3.09 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since April. The stock has climbed 32
percent this year.  Kelly Schlageter, a spokeswoman for Overland Park, Kansas-
based Sprint, said that Sprint and Ericsson determined it was
better to move the engineers and network personnel back to
Sprint for better strategic control of the expansion.  Sprint has said it will have LTE service in six major
cities, including Atlanta, Dallas and Baltimore, by mid-year. In
terms of that goal, “everything is tracking to plan,”
Schlageter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
