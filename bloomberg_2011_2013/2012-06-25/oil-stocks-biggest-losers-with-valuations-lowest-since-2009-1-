At a time of record fuel demand,
bountiful oil and natural gas, and expanding economies, no
stocks are doing worse in the world than energy producers from
 BP Plc (BP/)  to  Hess Corp. (HES)   The MSCI World Energy Index has declined 11 percent this
year, more than any other group, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The gauge has climbed 42 percent since equities
bottomed in 2009, less than any industry with earnings tied to
economic growth. In the U.S., the stocks are at the cheapest
levels relative to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since 2009.  The divergence reflects the transformation of an industry
where growing consumption of energy has been met with even
bigger gains in supply. U.S. crude inventories are the highest
since 1990 and natural gas prices have lost 36 percent in 12
months amid a glut spurred by hydraulic fracturing. Bears say
energy producers, making up about 10 percent of global stocks,
will keep equities from advancing. Bulls say the market will
rally when their shares rebound.  “The  S&P 500  will have a tough time making meaningful
progress until the energy sector bottoms and begins to move
higher,” Jim Russell, the Cincinnati-based chief equity
strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which oversees about
$116 billion, said in a phone interview on June 20. “Even
though the valuations of the stocks are cheap, the fundamentals
have not yet bottomed.”  Stocks Decline  The MSCI World Index slipped 0.2 percent to 1,205.67 last
week, while Houston-based  Plains Exploration & Production Co. (PXP) 
and Encana Corp., Canada’s biggest natural-gas producer, tumbled
more than 9.8 percent. The S&P GSCI commodities gauge slid to
the lowest level since 2010, bringing its loss since February to
21 percent, as manufacturing reports for the euro area and  China 
indicated contractions. The S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent today while
the MSCI World lost 1.4 percent.  Energy stocks are trailing the S&P 500 by 43 percentage
points since March 2009.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) 
are up less than 40 percent since then, while the U.S. equity
gauge almost doubled. In the last  bull market , which ended in
October, 2007, the industry surged 242 percent, better than any
industry and more than double the full index.  That rally occurred as earnings from oil and gas explorers
and refiners climbed to 12.9 percent of overall S&P 500 profits
in 2007, according to data compiled by  Howard Silverblatt , a New
York-based senior index analyst at S&P. The proportion has since
fallen to 10.7 percent.  Profit Estimates  Energy companies are the only U.S. industry whose earnings
forecasts have been revised from growth to contraction in 2012,
based on more than 10,000 analyst estimates tracked by
Bloomberg. Profits for the group will drop 5.8 percent, the
projections show. In January, analysts predicted income would
climb 2.2 percent. Earnings in the entire S&P 500 are forecast
to grow 7.4 percent this year.  Since 2000, there had been two times when energy shares
lagged behind the S&P 500 for four months or more, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. equity benchmark fell on
every occasion, with losses averaging 12 percent over the next
three months. The last time the industry trailed for this long,
the five months ended March 2010, the S&P 500 slumped as much as
16 percent from April through July.  Weaker Longer  “The energy sector might be weaker for longer,” Joseph Quinlan, New York-based chief market strategist with U.S. Trust,
which oversees $333 billion in client assets, said in a June 20
phone interview. “It’s cyclically driven by weaker global
demand and therefore weaker earnings outlook.”  Advances in technology that made it easier to find natural
gas have pushed its price down as much as 86 percent during the
past four years, reaching the lowest level in a decade in April.
Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, a technology used
to get petroleum and natural gas from shale-rock formations,
have become standard extraction techniques in America.  The natural gas boom helped the U.S. meet 81 percent of its
energy demand in 2011, the highest level since 1992, according
to U.S. Energy Department data compiled by Bloomberg. The slump
in gas prices prompted companies to try to offset falling
profits by boosting spending on oil drilling.  Gas futures rose 6.4 percent last week to $2.625 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contracts have fallen 9.9 percent in 2012.  Brent Crude  “A very large supply of natural gas is good news in a
sense that we are actually getting energy independent as a
country,” Dean Junkans, chief investment officer for the wealth
management, brokerage and retirement units of San Francisco-
based  Wells Fargo & Co ., which oversees $1.3 trillion in client
assets, said in a June 20 telephone interview. “But that
probably put pressure on oil price and the stocks of energy
companies.”  Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world’s oil, averaged $118.45 a barrel in the first quarter, up
12 percent from a year earlier. Oil in  New York  tumbled below
$80 a barrel last week and Brent fell below $90 on concern
demand will slow amid rising supplies.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
exceeded its output limit of 30 million barrels a day this year
as the prospect of sanctions against  Iran , the group’s second-
largest member, pushed Brent to a four-year high in March. In
the U.S., production climbed 1.9 percent to 6.35 million barrels
a day in the week ended June 15, the highest level since
February 1999, according to a report from the Energy Department
this month.  Oil Ratios  The S&P 500 Energy Index traded at 5.34 times the price of
oil in the second quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s down from the average ratio of 7 in the past
two decades.  The plunge in shares of fuel producers has reduced
valuations to 9.50 times 12-month earnings, Bloomberg data show.
That’s 28 percent below the S&P 500’s multiple of 13.3 and the
widest discount since September 2009.  Jonathan Golub , the chief U.S. market strategist at UBS AG,
said energy stocks are attractive. He boosted the industry to
overweight from market weight, meaning investors should hold the
shares more than their weight represented in benchmark indexes.  “We believe  oil prices  will rebound as macro concerns fade
and prices become more closely driven by supply and demand,”
Golub, based in New York, wrote in a June 18 note.  BP, Hess  Global oil consumption is forecast to reach a record 89.9
million barrels a day this year, according to the Paris-based
 International Energy Agency . The world economy may grow 2.3
percent in 2012 and 2.8 percent in 2013, based on the median
estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  BP,  Europe ’s second-biggest oil producer, has dropped 13
percent this year. About a third of the 32 analysts covering the
London-based BP have cut their 2012 profit forecasts during the
past four weeks. That reduced the average income estimate to
$1.06 a share, compared with $1.15 last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Hess fell 30 percent, more than three times the S&P 500
Energy Index. The New York-based oil company reported first-
quarter earnings that missed estimates and lowered its oil-
production estimate for the Bakken Shale formation in  North
Dakota . Almost half of the company’s market value has been wiped
out in the past 12 months.  Exxon Earnings  Exxon, the world’s largest energy company, said a drop in
U.S. natural gas prices hurt first-quarter profit by more than
$300 million. Exxon’s production was 51 percent oil and 49
percent gas last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Six of the 19 analysts tracked by Bloomberg reduced their
profit estimate for Irving, Texas-based Exxon in the past four
weeks. Per-share income will probably fall 4.3 percent to $8.06,
the first annual decline since 2009, analysts’ forecasts show.
The stock has slid 7.1 percent from this year’s high in January.  The decline in energy shares has cost investors about $112
billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
S&P 500 rallied 97 percent since a 12-year low on March 9
through June 22, 2009. Were energy stocks excluded, the
benchmark measure would have surged 111 percent to 1,426,
exceeding this year’s peak of 1,419.04, according to estimates
by Birinyi Associates Inc., a Westport, Connecticut-based
research and money-management firm.  “The market is going to continue to be challenged and
volatile and energy is one of the components,”  Stephen Wood ,
the New York-based chief market strategist for  North America  for
Russell Investments, said in a phone interview on June 21. His
firm oversees $155 billion. “In this environment, energy prices
are a consequence, not a cause.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
