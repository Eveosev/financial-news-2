The  Bank of England  shouldn’t expand
its bond-purchase program again because it is “damaging”
pensions and may be doing little to stimulate economic growth,
said Ros Altmann, director-general of retirement advisory group
SAGA.   “Given that we are in a double dip recession, bank lending
is falling and lending rates have been rising, it is far from
clear that quantitative easing is the right policy to get the
economy going,” Altmann said in an e-mailed statement today.
“Given the damage it is doing to pensions, I would urge caution
and careful consideration with a balanced analysis of how the
policy works.”  Altmann, a former U.K. Treasury adviser, said “distorting
the gilt market is dangerous, it undermines our pension system
and has side-effects that actually damage growth.”   “This policy may seem to make sense in academic models,
but in the real world, with our ageing population and pension
system that is underpinned by gilt yields, QE simply may not
work,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
