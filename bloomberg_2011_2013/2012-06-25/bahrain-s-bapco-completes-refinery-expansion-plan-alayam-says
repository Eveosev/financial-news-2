Bahrain Petroleum Co., or Bapco, has
completed a plan for expanding its only refinery, Alayam
reported, citing Oil Minister Abdul Hussain Ali Mirza.  The plan will be submitted to the cabinet soon for
approval, Mirza told the Bahraini  newspaper . The kingdom
exported 226,000 barrels of refined oil products per day last
year, Alayam cited Mirza as saying.  Investment of $6 billion to $10 billion is planned to
expand the refinery’s capacity to more than 450,000 barrels a
day from 260,000 now, the minister said on May 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
