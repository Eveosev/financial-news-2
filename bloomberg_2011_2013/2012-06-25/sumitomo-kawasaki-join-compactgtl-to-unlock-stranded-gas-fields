Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  and  Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7012)  teamed up with  CompactGTL Plc , a U.K.-based
developer of gas-to-liquid technologies, in a plan to tap
natural gas stranded in remote fields.  The three partners and Sumitomo Precision Products Co. will
build the first “modular commercial plant,” Sumitomo said in a
 statement  today. Sumitomo and Kawasaki bought minority stakes in
CompactGTL, the Abingdon, U.K.-based company said by e-mail.  CompactGTL has been working on technology to allow oil
producers to develop remote fields and cut flaring of gas pumped
with the crude.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  was assessing CompactGTL
and  Velocys  Inc. technologies before deciding which to deploy
offshore, Brazil’s state-run oil company said in February.  The partners are “seeking to win orders and expand sales
by enabling oilfield development in regions such as Russia,
Africa, the  Middle East , Asia and  South America ,” Sumitomo
said. Compact GTL is working with a unit of OAO Gazprom on a
potential project, the U.K. company said.  Gas-to-liquid plants use natural gas instead of oil to
produce synthetic crude or fuels containing almost no sulfur.  To contact the reporter on this story:
