Fenerbahce Sportif Hizmetler Sanayi
& Ticaret AS (FENER) , the listed arm of Istanbul soccer club Fenerbahce,
soared for a second day after the team said June 22 it had been
cleared to play in  Europe ’s Champions League Tournament.  The shares jumped 10.3 percent to 54.25 liras at 5 p.m. in
Istanbul, extending their gain over the last five days to 30
percent. The volume of shares traded was more than five times
the stock’s three-month average.  Turkey ’s benchmark ISE National
Index fell 1.4 percent, the first time in five days.  The clearance is “for the time being” and pending a final
decision from UEFA’s Control & Disciplinary Body, which is
investigating charges that Fenerbahce officials and players were
involved in match fixing, according to a statement from the team
on June 22.  Participation in the tournament could translate into about
40 million euros ($50 million) of additional revenue for
Fenerbahce “should it succeed in preliminary rounds,”
Istanbul-based brokerage Tera Brokers said in a report to
clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
