The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations fell 14.6 cents in the past
two weeks to $3.4780 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended June 22 and is based on
information received from about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo,
California-based company. The price is down 15.03 cents from a
year earlier. It is 48.9 cents below the highest average this
year of $3.9671, during the two weeks ended April 6.  Europe’s “woeful” economy and “unimpressive” growth in
the U.S. have caused crude oil and gasoline prices to plummet,
 Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in
a telephone interview. “If economic indicators appear even
worse, then we will probably see  oil prices  decline further.”  Prices at the pump fell as West Texas Intermediate crude
for July delivery on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange slid
$4.24, or 5.2 percent, in two weeks to $79.76 a barrel on June
22. Futures have declined 27 percent since reaching a year-to-
date high of $109.77 on Feb. 24.  Gasoline futures for June delivery on the Nymex sank 11.53
cents, or 4.2 percent, during the period to $2.5699. Gasoline
has lost 25 percent since reaching a 2012 high of $3.4166 on
March 26.  Growth Concerns  Futures have fallen on concern that growth is slowing in
the U.S. and China as manufacturing weakens and more Americans
than forecast filed for jobless claims in the week ended June
15, indicating fuel demand may decline.  A gauge of euro-region manufacturing fell to 44.8 from 45.1
in May, London-based Markit Economics said June 21 in an initial
estimate. The preliminary reading of 48.1 for a June Chinese
purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
indicated contraction.  The  Federal Reserve  on June 20 cut its growth estimates for
the  U.S. economy . Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , speaking at a
Washington press conference that same day, said policy makers
are focusing “primarily” on the outlook for jobs in deciding
whether to ease further, and more  action would be needed
without “sustained improvement in the labor market.”  Jobless claims in the U.S. declined 2,000 to 387,000 in the
seven days ended June 15, Labor Department figures showed on
June 21, higher than the 383,000  forecast  in a survey by
Bloomberg.  Oil may decline next week on signals that global economic
growth is slowing as U.S. inventories increase, a Bloomberg
survey showed.  Fourteen of 27 analysts, or 52 percent, forecast crude will
decline through June 29. Nine respondents, or 33 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and four said
there will be an increase. Last week, 44 percent of analysts
projected a decrease.  On Long Island, regular gasoline was $3.64 a gallon,
according to Lundberg. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged
$3.83.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed was in  San Francisco , where the average was
$3.95 a gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Jackson,
Mississippi, where customers paid an average of $3.03 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
