Ethiopia signed a $1.5 billion
agreement with state-run China Communications Construction Co.
to build a railway to carry potash from mines being developed in
the nation’s northeast.  The 360-kilometer (224-mile) line will transport passengers
and freight along a route to neighboring Djibouti’s Tadjourah
port, which is being built. It should be completed by July 2015,
Ethiopia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its
website yesterday.  CCCC (1800) , a Chinese government-owned transportation
infrastructure company, will be “mobilizing substantial
resources to guarantee completion of the project,” the ministry
said, citing the company’s vice president, Zhou Yongheng.  Ethiopia, sub-Saharan Africa’s second-most populous nation,
is in the middle of a five-year plan to modernize and upgrade
its infrastructure and industries. The government last year
signed two agreements with Chinese companies to build a 4,744-
kilometer (2,948-mile) rail network to Djibouti.  Landlocked Ethiopia lost its access to the sea after
Eritrea voted for independence in 1993. The new rail line will
run between the cities of Mekele and Hara Gebaya.  Canada’s  Allana Potash Corp. (AAA) , Sainik Potash Plc of India,
 Ethiopian Potash Corp. (FED)  and Melbourne-based BHP Billiton Ltd. are
all developing projects to extract potash, a fertilizer
ingredient, in the Afar region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
