The U.S. Treasury Department said it
is starting secondary public offerings of preferred stock it
holds in seven banks as part of the Troubled Asset Relief
Program.  The Treasury said in a statement today that it was
conducting offerings of its stock positions in  Fidelity Southern
Corp. (LION)  of Atlanta; Firstbank Corp. of Alma, Michigan;  First
Citizens Banc Corp. (FCZA)  of Sandusky,  Ohio ;  MetroCorp Bancshares Inc. (MCBI) 
of Houston; Peoples Bancorp of  North Carolina  Inc. of Newton,
North Carolina; Pulaski Financial Corp. of  St. Louis ; and
 Southern First Bancshares Inc. (SFST)  of Greenville, South Carolina.  Under TARP, originally approved by Congress in 2008 as a
$700 billion dollar program to rescue financial institutions,
the Treasury put cash into banks in exchange for equity stakes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
