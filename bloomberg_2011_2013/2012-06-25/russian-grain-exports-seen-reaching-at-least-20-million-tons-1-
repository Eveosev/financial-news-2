Russian  grain exports  will come to
at least 20 million metric tons in the coming marketing year,
Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fedorov said.  The grains and legumes crop will be about 85 million tons,
enough to meet domestic needs for 72.7 million tons of feed and
milling grains in the period starting July 1, he told reporters
in Moscow today. Farmers will harvest grains over 44.8 million
hectares (110.7 million acres), Fedorov said at a government
meeting, an e-mailed statement from his ministry showed.  “We don’t see any grounds to frighten anybody with an
embargo” on grain shipments, the minister said. Russia barred
all cereal exports in August 2010 as a drought seared fields and
kept the ban in place until July 1 of last year.  Wheat for September delivery, the contract with the highest
open interest, jumped 6.5 percent to $7.32 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade by 6:59 p.m. Moscow time. The grain is up
12 percent this year.  Russian crop losses from winter frosts and a spring drought
were average at 2.4 percent of the total sown area, Fedorov
said. That compares with last year’s 2 percent rate, he said.  Harvesting began about 10 days earlier than normal because
of the drought, according to the ministry statement. Farmers
reaped more than 200,000 tons of grains at yields of 2.9 tons a
hectare, it showed.  The Volgograd and Rostov regions and the Republic of
Kalmykia in the Southern Federal District were among areas worst
affected by the drought, according to the minister. He also
singled out the Penza and Saratov regions in the Volga Federal
District; the Voronezh, Lipetsk and Tula regions in the Central
Federal District; and Siberia’s Altai region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
