Florida’s orange crop, the world’s
second largest, may face damage as Tropical Storm Debby drenches
groves and causes flooding in some areas, said  Jim Dale , a
senior risk meteorologist for British Weather Services.  Some areas of Florida may receive 10 inches (25
centimeters) of rain by June 28, Dale said today by telephone
from High Wycombe,  England . Much of the central part of the
state and the Panhandle are under a tornado watch, while coastal
areas have flood  warnings , National Weather Service data show.  “Looking forward at the next three or four days, this is a
major event,” Dale said. “There will be some considerable
amounts of rainfall and localized flooding, and damage to the
orange crop probably will occur.”  Florida ’s orange harvest starts in October and runs through
July. Production in the 2011-12 crop year will total 146.2
million boxes, up from 140.5 million boxes a year earlier, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said June 12. A box weighs 90
pounds.  Brazil  is the world’s biggest orange grower.  Orange juice futures have dropped 40 percent in the past
year. The contract for September delivery jumped 6 percent last
week to $1.157 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Today,
the price fell 0.3 percent to $1.1530 as of 8:21 a.m. local
time, after earlier rising as much as 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
