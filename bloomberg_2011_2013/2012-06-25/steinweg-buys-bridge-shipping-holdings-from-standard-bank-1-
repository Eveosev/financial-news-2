C Steinweg Handelsveem BV, a
Rotterdam-based warehouse operator, bought 63.9 percent of
Bridge Shipping (Pty) Ltd. after its purchase of Nomad Freight
(Pty) Ltd., another Johannesburg operator, in December.  “We’ve been looking for a global partner we can link up
with to enable us to have access to a much bigger extent of the
market, the global market,” Bridge Shipping Chief Executive
Officer Colin Emanuel said today by mobile phone. “Now we’re
part of the Steinweg group, we’re able to add value throughout
the supply chain.”  He didn’t give the price of the purchase by Steinweg, which
handles materials including chrome and manganese.  South Africa 
has the world’s largest reserves of those commodities.  Standard Bank  Group Ltd.,  Africa ’s largest lender, reduced
its holdings in Bridge to 17 percent as part of the deal and
will exit its investment in the next three years, Emanuel said.  Steinweg, approved by the London Metals Exchange to store
metals, also bought holdings from RRL Holdings, he said. Ulf
Boll, CEO of Steinweg, declined to comment on the transaction
when Bloomberg News reached him today by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
