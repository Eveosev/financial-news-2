Peru’s sol fell to its lowest level
in a week on concern European Union leaders meeting this week
won’t succeed in taming the region’s debt crisis, curbing demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol declined 0.4 percent to 2.6620 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, and earlier sank to 2.6645, the weakest since
June 15, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The euro may dissolve if European leaders fail to resolve
the region’s debt crisis at a two-day summit starting in
Brussels on June 28, billionaire investor  George Soros  said
yesterday. Global stocks fell and the euro weakened.  Foreign investors sought refuge in the dollar amid the
slump in equity markets, said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader
at  Banco Santander  in Lima.  Peru’s central bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the  spot
market .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 declined two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.02 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.16 centimo to 118.51
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
