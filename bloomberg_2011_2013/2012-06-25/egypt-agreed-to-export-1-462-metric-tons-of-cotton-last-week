Egypt  agreed to export 1,462 metric
tons of cotton in the week through June 21, the Alexandria
Cotton Exporters Association said.  The country has shipped 77,234.5 tons of the fiber, valued
at $241.7 million, since the marketing year began Sept. 1, the
association said today in a weekly bulletin. Of last week’s
agreed sales, 114 tons were of the Giza 88 variety and 1,348
tons were of Giza 86.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter-staple cotton and used
in luxury clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are the
top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
