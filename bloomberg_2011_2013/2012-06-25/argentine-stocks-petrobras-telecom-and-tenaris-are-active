The following companies had  unusual 
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in

Aires . The  Merval (MERVAL)  index fell 2.3 percent to 2,287.84.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)   dropped 8.1 percent to
59.90 pesos, its biggest fall in 10 months. Shares in  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil company retreated today after the company
announced an increase in fuel prices that was below some
analysts’ expectations.  Telecom Argentina SA (TECO2 AF), the country’s largest
telecommunications company, fell 5.1 percent to 14.90 pesos, the
most in almost eight weeks. The stock retreated in line with
global markets and amid speculation it will change its pricing
for mobile phone clients to charge per second instead of per
minute, Juan Jose Vasquez, an analyst at Buenos Aires-based Bull
Market Brokers, said in a phone interview.  An official from Telecom’s communications department didn’t
answer a call seeking comment.  Tenaris SA (TS)   lost 2.2 percent to 107.05 pesos. The
world’s largest producer of seamless steel tubes used in the oil
industry fell in line with the price of crude in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
