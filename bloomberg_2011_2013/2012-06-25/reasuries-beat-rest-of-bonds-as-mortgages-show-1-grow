Treasuries are beating all other
U.S. fixed-income securities for the first time in three
quarters as investors around the world seek the safest assets.  U.S. government debt  has gained 2.9 percent since March,
while corporate bonds returned 1.9 percent, mortgages rose 1
percent and municipal bonds increased 1.8 percent, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The combination of
Europe’s debt crisis, China’s slowdown and record stimulus by
the  Federal Reserve  means Treasuries are outperforming the
global bond market by 1.3 percentage points, after lagging
behind by 2.4 percentage points in the previous quarter.  The returns show that even after the Fed kept the economy
growing for 11-straight quarters by buying $2.3 trillion of
assets and continuing to swap $667 billion of short-term debt
into longer-term securities, bond investors expect the economy
will remain sluggish. The extra yield investors demand to own
anything else besides Treasuries corresponds to an expansion of
less than 1 percent, according to Barclays Plc index data
compiled by ING Investment Management.  “With the weight of everything, there are not enough
points of light and promise out there to get you to say ‘I’m
going to go for that risk-based asset,’” Mitchell Stapley,
chief fixed-income officer at Grand Rapids, Michigan-based Fifth
Third Asset Management, which oversees $15 billion in assets,
said in a June 22 telephone interview. “You’re going to sleep
less badly by buying a U.S. Treasury security.”  Record Low  Yields on benchmark  10-year notes  fell to a record low of
1.44 percent on June 1, after the economy added fewer jobs in
May than analysts forecast, suggesting the European sovereign-
debt crisis is restraining U.S. growth.  The 1.75 percent security due in May 2022 fell 28/32, or
$8.75 per $1,000 face value, to 100 21/32 last week, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield rose 10 basis points,
or 0.1 percentage point, to 1.68 percent. A year earlier, the
yield on the benchmark security for everything from consumer
loans to corporate borrowing was  2.98 percent.   The yield dropped six basis points to 1.61 percent as of
8:55 a.m.  New York  time.  Treasuries gained 0.87 percent this quarter through June 21
on a risk-adjusted basis, which takes into account  volatility ,
while securities from  government bonds  to mortgages globally
have returned 0.28 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data.  ‘Major Shortage’  There is a “major shortage of safe assets in the global
financial system,” according to a report yesterday from the
 Bank for International Settlements  in  Basel ,  Switzerland .  Debt from companies and municipalities to securities
created by packaging mortgages and other assets gained less, in
part because the $10.5 trillion Treasury market is the most
liquid pool of securities in the world, so prices respond to new
information the fastest. Primary dealers  traded  $504 billion of
U.S. government debt the week that ended June 13, according to
Fed data. That compares with $93 billion of corporate bonds
during the same period.  Average yields in the $5.13 trillion U.S. corporate  bond
market  declined to 4.28 percent as of June 22 from 4.81 percent
at the end of last year, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. They’ve fallen to 1.9 percent from 1.98
percent in the $5 trillion mortgage market.  Mortgage Spreads  The bank’s index of $902 billion of state and local
government debt showed yields declined to 3.38 percent from 3.6
percent. The $377 billion index of asset-backed securities has
returned 0.66 percent this quarter as yields dropped to an
average of 1.3 percent from 1.58 percent at the end of 2011.  Mortgage securities yield about 80 basis points more than
benchmark Treasuries, compared with an average of about 75 basis
points when the  U.S. economy  grows at a rate of about zero to 1
percent, according to ING Investment Management. Investment-
grade corporate bond spreads are about 31 basis points wider
than the average for that level of expansion.  Five years after bonds tied to subprime mortgages started
to collapse, triggering the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression, many investors said they are still more
concerned about getting their capital back than about the return
on the investment.  Haven Scarcity  “We are in a world where we have a scarcity of true safe-
haven assets,” Wan-Chong Kung, a bond-fund manager in
 Minneapolis  at Nuveen Asset Management, which oversees more than
$100 billion, said in a June 20 telephone interview. “As long
as people still feel like they need some safety in their
portfolio, and need to find some shelter, Treasuries will
continue to find a bid.”  The U.S. is one of only six major economies with credit-
default swaps on their debt trading at less than 100 basis
points, meaning they are viewed as almost risk free. A year ago,
eight Group of 10 nations fit that category, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Even if U.S. growth accelerates, yields on the 10-year note
are only forecast to increase to 2.16 percent by the end of the
year, according to the median estimate of 63 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. Yields averaged 4.35 percent in the five years
before the financial crisis began in June 2007, and about 6.7
percent over the past 50 years.  ‘Well Contained’  “There’s not going to be a serious backup,” or much
higher rates, said Rob Robis, head of fixed-income macro
strategies in Atlanta at ING Groep NV’s ING Investment
Management, which oversees about $160 billion. “Treasury
yields, while quite boring, will be well-contained.”  Swiss and Danish government bond yields traded at less than
zero percent this month as European leaders debate a more
integrated fiscal and banking union.  Greece  is seeking to
renegotiate the country’s second bailout to ensure there are no
further wage and pension cuts in the next two years and to
protect jobs in the civil sector. Spain’s banks would need as
much as 62 billion euros ($77.5 billion) in capital to withstand
a worst-case economic scenario, according to two consulting
firms hired by the government.  “People are terrified,”  Stuart Thomson , a  money manager 
in Glasgow at Ignis Asset Management, which oversees the
equivalent of $109 billion, said in a June 22 interview. “The
U.S. is the true safe haven at the moment.”  Operation Twist  Fed officials led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week
expanded their program to replace $400 billion of short-term
bonds with longer-term debt, known as Operation Twist, by $267
billion and lowered their estimate for 2012 growth to a range of
1.9 percent to 2.4 percent, from 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent in
April.  The economy added 69,000 jobs in May, the fewest in a year,
and unemployment unexpectedly climbed to 8.2 percent, the Labor
Department reported June 1. The jobless rate has remained above
8 percent since January 2009, making it a critical issue as
President  Barack Obama  seeks reelection in November.  Extending Twist “instills a bit of confidence that the Fed
is here,”  Andy Richman , who oversees $12 billion as a director
of fixed-income in West Palm Beach, Florida for SunTrust Bank’s
wealth and investment management division, said June 20 in a
telephone interview. “The Fed is worried about employment. They
want to do what they can to support the balance sheet of the
consumer. They don’t need to do more at this point.”  Fed Support  The unprecedented amounts of money pumped into the
financial system through bond purchases, known as quantitative
easing, or QE, combined with interest rates near zero since
December 2008 have resulted in historically low  yields  without
inflation.  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to
set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which gauges average inflation between 2017 and 2022, dropped as
low as 2.41 percent on June 18, down from a 2012 high of 2.78
percent on March 19. As recently as Aug. 1 the rate climbed to
as high as 3.23 percent.  That means the cost to the Obama administration of
financing a fourth-straight deficit exceeding $1 trillion is
declining. The U.S. spent $272 billion on interest expense in
fiscal 2012 through May, compared with $275.3 billion at the
same point in fiscal 2011.  Companies are taking advantage of the lowest yields ever to
refinance and extend maturities of outstanding debt. The lowest
 mortgage rates  on record are also helping to stabilize the U.S.
housing market.  Record Deficits  Yields on U.S. investment-grade debt fell to 3.4 percent
from 7.82 percent at the end of 2008, 4.89 percent a year later
and a record low 3.33 percent May 8, according to Bank of
America indexes.  Corporate-bond issuance has an average maturity of 10.6
years this year, compared with 10.1 percent in 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Target Corp. auctioned $1.5 billion of debt due in July
2042 in its first 30-year bond sale since 2008 on June 21,
according to Bloomberg data. The securities were priced to yield
145 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries. The
second-largest U.S. discount retailer sold $2.25 billion of 7
percent bonds maturing in 2038 four years ago at a spread of 270
basis points.  Falling mortgage-bond yields mean home-loan  rates  are also
at record lows, with 30-year borrowing costs at 3.66 percent,
down from last year’s high of 5.05 percent on Feb. 10, according
to weekly surveys by finance company  Freddie Mac .  Housing Market  Cheaper loans are helping the housing market recover. U.S.
home prices rose in April for a third month, the  Federal Housing
Finance Agency  reported June 21. Prices climbed 0.8 percent from
March and 3 percent from a year earlier.  D.R. Horton Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by volume,
issued $350 million of 4.75 percent notes due May 2017 on April
25. The securities, priced at a spread of 390 basis points, have
rallied since the Fort Worth, Texas-based company’s sale to 346
basis points on June 21, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the financial industry regulatory authority.  State and local governments have sold about $103 billion in
bonds to refinance previously issued debt in 2012, the most for
the period since at least 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. About 58 percent of total issuance in the market has
been for refinancing, the data show. In the previous five years,
the average had been 40 percent.  Tax Exempt  The yield on top-rated tax-exempt bonds due in 10 years
declined to 1.9 percent in the week ended June 22, the first
drop in three weeks, according to a Bloomberg Valuation Index.
The  interest rate  fell to 1.74 percent on Feb. 2, the lowest
since at least January 2009, when the index begins.  Georgia, with top ratings from the three biggest rating
companies, sold about $737 million in bonds last week to
partially refund debt, with a 10-year portion priced to yield
1.86 percent, Bloomberg data show.  The U.S economy is forecast to grow 2.2 percent this year,
compared with a contraction of 0.12 percent for Europe,
Bloomberg surveys of economists show. The expansion of China’s
gross domestic product may fall 1 percentage point from last
year to 8.2 percent.  “Treasury returns are definitely a reflection of the
outlook for growth,” Dan Orlando, managing director and head of
U.S. government trading at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, said
June 21 in a telephone interview. “There are concerns globally,
certainly in Europe. There’s potential for China slowdown, the
fiscal cliff here in the U.S., and we have our own problems on
the economic front as well.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
