Spanish banks may have their credit
ratings cut by Moody’s Investors Service for a second time in
less than six weeks after the nation’s sovereign rating was
lowered, said three people with knowledge of the situation.  The downgrades may be announced as early as today or
tomorrow, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because they aren’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly. A
Moody’s official in  London  declined to comment by phone.  Spain ’s credit grade was lowered three steps on June 13 by
Moody’s, which cited the nation’s increased debt burden,
weakening economy and limited access to  capital markets . The
country was reduced to Baa3 from A3 and remains on review for a
further cut as it plans to borrow 100 billion euros ($125
billion) from European Union rescue funds to recapitalize its
banking system, adding to the government’s debt load,  New York- 
based Moody’s said at the time.  Sixteen Spanish banks were lowered by Moody’s on May 17 on
economic weakness and the government’s mounting debt.  Newspaper Expansion reported earlier today that the
nation’s banks may be cut by Moody’s, citing an unidentified
executive at a Spanish lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
