Spain ’s Socialist Party today is set
to appeal the government’s tax-amnesty program for incomes
exceeding 100,000 ($125,000) a year to the Constitutional Court,
Europa Press reported, citing a copy of the filing.  Allowing individuals who evaded taxes to declare the money
and avoid prosecution in return for paying a penalty of only 10
percent is “totally incommensurate” with what they should
face, according to the argument of the main opposition group to
the government, according to the report.  In contrast, a taxpayer in that income bracket caught
evading payment must face on average a 43 percent tax rate plus
a 20 percent surcharge that covers penalties and interest,
Europa Press reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
