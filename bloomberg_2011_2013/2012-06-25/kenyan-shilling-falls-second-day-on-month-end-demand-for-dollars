Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
second day, snapping gains in seven consecutive trading
sessions, as businesses increased demand for dollars to pay
month-end bills.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy depreciated
0.4 percent to 84.18 by 4:18 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, the
biggest drop since June 12.  “The shilling weakening is due to month-end demand for the
dollar by businesses as they pay their bills and it’s expected
to be under pressure in the days ahead,” Duncan Kinuthia, a
dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in
a phone interview today.  The shilling appreciated 2.2 percent in the seven days
through June 21, closing at 83.55 per dollar, the highest since
May 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Kenya’s central
bank did not offer repurchase agreements and term-auction
deposits for a fourth day today, a bank official who asked not
to be identified in line with policy said.  Uganda ’s shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 2,469 per dollar,
weakening for the first time in five days. Tanzania’s currency
appreciated by 0.3 percent to 1,578 per dollar, the highest on a
closing basis since May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
