Internet companies led declines in
 Chinese stocks  traded in the U.S., sending the benchmark index
to the lowest level in three weeks, after  Citigroup Inc. (C)  reduced
its expansion estimate for Asia’s biggest economy this year.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies sank 2.6 percent at the close of trading in
New York to 87.91, the lowest since June 5. The index has
declined 2.4 percent in 2012. Online video-sharing websites
Youku Inc. and Tudou Holdings Inc. tumbled more than 6 percent
while Qihoo 360 Technology Co., a computer security software
developer, fell to a four-month low.  Citigroup cut its forecast for China’s 2012 gross domestic
product to 7.8 percent from 8.1 percent, citing a slowdown in
domestic activity in the second quarter and further weakening of
European demand. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  hardened her
resistance to euro-area debt sharing, raising concern the summit
this week will fail to tame the region’s crisis. Former central
bank adviser  Li Daokui  said yesterday China won’t reduce
 interest rates  as frequently as banks’ reserve ratios.  “The sentiment continues to be extremely negative and
people continue to reduce risk,” Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at
Oberweis Asset Management Inc., which manages $700 million, said
by phone yesterday from Lisle, Illinois. “GDP growth is being
ratcheted down in China given some of the weak data we’ve seen
this year.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slid 2.2 percent to $31.83,
the lowest level since October. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of
mainland stocks fell 1.6 percent to 2,224.11, a five-month low.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares decreased 1.6
percent to 1,313.72.  Hard Landing  An escalation in the European debt crisis may cause a hard
landing in China as weaker external demand erodes the country’s
growth by nearly 1 percentage point, Shuang Ding and Minggao
Shen, Hong Kong-based analysts at Citigroup, wrote in a report
dated June 22.  Youku (YOKU) , China’s most popular online video website, sank 6.9
percent to a one-month low of $21. The company announced on
March 12 a plan to acquire smaller competitor Tudou in a stock
swap deal currently  valued  at $825 million. Tudou lost 6.3
percent to $32.56. The transaction is expected to complete in
the third quarter after the approval of shareholders, the
companies said in March.  Beijing-based Qihoo, which also develops computer desktop
applications, extended its slump to a fourth day, tumbling 4.5
percent to $17.11, the lowest level since February.  NetEase, 21Vianet  51job Inc. (JOBS) , an online recruiting service provider based in
Shanghai, dropped 3.6 percent to a five-month low of $43.98.
 NetEase Inc. (NTES) , operator of China’s second-largest online games
website, sank 5.4 percent to $56.50, the most since Dec. 21.  21Vianet Group Inc. (VNET) , a Beijing-based Internet data center
services provider, declined for the first time in nine days,
retreating 5.3 percent to $11.35.  The central bank cut interest rates on June 7 for the first
time since 2008 following three reductions to the reserve
requirement ratio for banks since November.  China won’t have “aggressive” declines in interest rates
and investors will “sit on the sidelines” until they see
China’s economic recovery,  Jing Ulrich , managing director and
chairman of global markets for China at JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
said at a conference in  Hong Kong  yesterday. Banks are willing
to lend but demand for loans is weak, she said.  Melco Drops  American depositary receipts of  Melco Crown Entertainment
Ltd. (MPEL) , which operates casinos in Macau, the only Chinese city
where they are legal, tumbled 4.1 percent to $11.34, the lowest
since June 15. Gabriel Chan, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group
AG in Hong Kong,  lowered  Melco Crown’s 12-month price target to
$16.80 from $17.55 while maintaining an outperform rating in a
report yesterday.  Elong Inc. (LONG) , a Chinese online travel company whose largest
shareholder is U.S.-based  Expedia Inc. (EXPE) , fell 6.5 percent, the
first decline in three days, to $11.09.  To contact the reporter on this story:
