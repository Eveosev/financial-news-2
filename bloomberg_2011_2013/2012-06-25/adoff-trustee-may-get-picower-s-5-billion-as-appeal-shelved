The liquidator of  Bernard Madoff ’s
firm may gain access to $5 billion from investor Jeffry
Picower’s estate to pay defrauded customers after an investor
lawyer said he wouldn’t appeal the key court ruling allowing it.  Jim Beasley, an attorney who represented Madoff investor
Adele Fox, said today in an interview he wouldn’t challenge a
decision allowing Madoff trustee Irving Picard access to the
funds. Picard said today that he may be able to access the money
by July 16 if there are no further challenges.  Madoff was convicted of masterminding the largest Ponzi
scheme in U.S. history and is serving a 150-year prison
sentence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
