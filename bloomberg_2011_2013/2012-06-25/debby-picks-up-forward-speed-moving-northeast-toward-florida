(Corrects date in second paragraph.)  Tropical Storm Debby’s top winds
held at 45 miles (73 kilometers) an hour as the system’s forward
speed increased to 5 mph on a track toward the Florida Coast,
the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory shortly before
2 p.m. East Coast time.  The center’s latest tracking map shows Debby making
landfall early June 28 west of Gainesville. The system is about
50 miles south-southwest of Apalachicola.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
