Asian  stocks  fell as UBS AG cut its
profit outlook for  BHP Billiton  Ltd. and the  Bank for
International Settlements  said central banks are facing the
limit of their ability to boost economic growth.  BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company, led
materials companies lower, sliding 1.4 percent.  Samsung (005930) 
Electronics Co. fell 4.2 percent, dragging technology stocks
lower, as the world’s top mobile-phone maker investigated a
complaint that one of its smartphones caught fire.  Billabong
International Ltd. (BBG) ,  Australia ’s largest surf-wear maker, slumped
34 percent after selling A$155 million ($155 million) of new
shares.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slid 0.6 percent to 113.44 as
of 8 p.m. in Tokyo as five stocks fell for every two that rose.
The Asian benchmark has lost 12 percent from this year’s highest
level in February, erasing this year’s advance, amid concern
growth in the U.S. and  China  is slowing as Europe’s debt crisis
deteriorates. Italy and  Spain  will sell debt tomorrow and
European Union leaders will hold a two-day summit starting June
28.  “There is a question mark as to how many years we are
going to see sub-par growth for,”  Erwin Sanft , chief strategist
for Pan-Asia equities at BNP Paribas SA in  Hong Kong , said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television today. “Growth has been
disappointing across the board.”  South Korea’s Kospi Index sank 1.2 percent, Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.5 percent and Japan’s Nikkei 225
Stock Average slid 0.7 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
retreated 0.5 percent, while China’s Shanghai Composite Index
dropped 1.6 percent.  Stimulus Limits  Central banks are being “cornered into prolonging monetary
stimulus,” the Basel, Switzerland-based BIS said in its annual
report, published yesterday. “Both conventionally and
unconventionally accommodative monetary policies are palliatives
and have their limits.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.7
percent today. The index rose 0.7 percent in New York on June 22
as bank downgrades from Moody’s Investors Service were no worse
than the firm had warned. The ratings firm cut Morgan Stanley by
two levels rather than a threatened three grades. Banks rose the
most among the 24 industry groups in the  S&P 500 .  “The volatility will remain,” said  Savanth Sebastian ,
Sydney-based equities economist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , the nation’s largest lender. “The market wants more
clarity for what’s going on in Europe and that’s what is
lacking.”  Soros Warning  The Asia-Pacific benchmark index has lost 0.4 percent this
this year,  compared with  a 6.2 percent advance by the S&P 500
and a 0.8 percent gain by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian gauge are valued at 1.2 times book value, compared
with 2.1 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for the Stoxx 600,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. A number below 1 means
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Billionaire investor  George Soros  called on Europe to start
a fund to buy Italian and Spanish bonds, warning that a failure
by leaders meeting this week to produce drastic measures could
spell the demise of the currency.  Policy makers should create a
body to purchase sovereign debt in return for Italy and Spain
implementing achievable budget cuts, Soros said in an interview
in London yesterday.  Italy is scheduled to sell inflation-linked securities
maturing in 2016 and 2026 tomorrow as well as 3 billion euros
($3.8 billion) of zero-coupon bonds. Spain will offer three- and
six-month bills the same day.  China GDP  Citigroup Inc. reduced its 2012 gross domestic product
forecast for China to 7.8 percent from 8.1 percent, citing
anemic domestic activity in the second quarter and further
weakening of European demand.  BHP Billiton (BHP)  lost 1.4 percent to A$31.07. UBS downgraded
earnings estimates the company by 4 percent due to Australia’s
mining and carbon taxes. BHP will pay $715 million in mining tax
and A$300 million ($302 million) in carbon tax in the year
ending June 30, 2013, according to UBS analyst  Glyn Lawcock .  The carbon tax will cost Rio Tinto Group $202 million,
while the mining tax will cost the company $676 million in the
2013 calendar year, he said. Rio pared losses as of much as 1.6
percent to close 0.2 percent lower at A$55.90.  Samsung declined 4.2 percent to 1.132 million won. A Galaxy
S III smartphone owner in Ireland posted photos online June 20
showing the phone scorched on the bottom. Samsung’s local office
has obtained the handset and is trying to identify the cause of
the incident,  James Chung , a Seoul-based spokesman for Samsung,
said by phone.  Billabong slumped 34 percent to 96 Australian cents in
Sydney. The maker of Kustom shoes and Billabong clothing has had
its recommendation cut to sell by analysts at Citigroup and UBS
since reducing its earnings target on June 21 and announcing the
share sale.  Yahoo Japan Corp. fell 1.5 percent to 24,870 yen as the
government said it will question the company about plans to
display advertisements based on users’ e-mail messages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
