A group of eminent former European
political leaders is proposing the establishment of a debt
agency to issue commonly backed euro-region bonds in return for
the cession by governments of more control over national
budgets, the Financial Times reported.  The group, which includes Jacques Delors, the former
president of the European Commission, and Helmut Schmidt, a
former chancellor of  Germany , will issue a 49-page report today
on the proposal, the FT said, citing the report.  The report, which states as a core principle: “sovereignty
ends when solvency ends,” will call for all euro-area countries
to agree to issue debt equal to 10 percent of their economic
output through the proposed European debt agency, to create an
available, liquid debt-issuance market, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
