Thailand’s baht declined to a three-
week low after international investors cut holdings of the
nation’s stocks.  Government bonds  were steady.  The baht retreated for a fourth day after exchange data
showed global funds sold $140 million more Thai equities than
they bought last week. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index
fell before European Union leaders hold a two-day summit in
 Belgium  starting June 28 to discuss measures to resolve the
region’s debt crisis.  “Foreigners have been net sellers in Thailand for quite
some time and that put downward pressure on the baht,” said
Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank
Pcl. “Sentiment remains weak until the EU summit. Dollar demand
from importers seems to be more than baht demand from
exporters.”  The baht lost 0.4 percent to 31.87 per dollar as of 8:31
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 31.88 earlier, the weakest level since June 1.
It may trade between 31.60 and 32 this week, Disawat said.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed 99 basis
points, or 0.99 percentage point, to 5.5 percent.  Thailand ’s exports rose 0.5 percent in May from a year
earlier after declining 3.67 percent in April, while imports
climbed 9 percent following a 7.87 percent increase, according
to the median forecasts of economists in Bloomberg News surveys
before government data due at 1:30 p.m. local time.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 was
unchanged at 3.34 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
