Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped the most
in nearly a week and bonds declined as  Europe ’s debt crisis
damped demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency retreated for a second day after exchange data
showed global funds sold $229 million more local stocks than
they bought this month through June 22. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan
Asia Dollar Index reached a two-week low before European Union
leaders hold a two-day summit in  Belgium  starting June 28 to
discuss measures to resolve the region’s debt crisis.  “The rupiah’s weakening is mostly driven by factors from
outside the country, while there is still a lot of need for
dollars domestically,” said Gusti Kahari, a Jakarta-based
foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Artha Graha Internasional.
“We hope the outcome of the EU summit will be for the longer
term and not just a temporary relief.”  The rupiah weakened 0.4 percent, the most since June 19, to
9,475 per dollar as of 3:30 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It touched a three-week low of
9,528 earlier. The currency has slumped 4.5 percent this year,
the second-worst performance among  Asia ’s most-traded
currencies, after  India ’s rupee.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 10.5 percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.21
percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. The yield has climbed 18 basis points this year
after touching a record low of 5.05 percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
