German lawmakers will probably
extend their current session into July to vote on  Spain ’s
request for European Union aid to its banks, the  Rheinische Post 
said, citing Hermann Otto Solms, the deputy president of the
lower house of parliament, or Bundestag.  The aim is to hold the vote by July 9, the newspaper
reported in an e-mailed article to appear in tomorrow’s edition.  Without emergency business, the Bundestag’s summer recess
is due to start June 30, according to the chamber’s official
schedule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
