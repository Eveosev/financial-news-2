The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission accused a  Utah  man of defrauding investors of $100
million by promising outsized returns in a real estate-based
Ponzi scheme.  Wayne L. Palmer and his firm, National Note of Utah LC,
told investors they would reap annual returns of 12 percent
through his plan to buy mortgage notes and real estate assets,
the SEC said in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Utah
today. The agency said in a statement it obtained a temporary
restraining order and asset freeze.  Palmer told investors that their money would be completely
secure and that National Note had never missed a payment on its
promissory notes, the SEC said. Instead, National Note used most
of the money it took in from new investors to pay its earlier
clients, according to the complaint.  “Palmer promised double-digit returns at his real estate
seminars, where investors learned the hard way about his lies
and deceit,” Kenneth  Israel , head of the SEC’s regional office
in  Salt Lake City , said in a statement.  A phone call to Randall Mackey, an attorney for Palmer,
wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporters on this story:
