Ethanol increased the most since
March as corn used to make the fuel rose to the highest level
since November.  The biofuel gained as the most-active December corn
contract surged on forecasts that dry weather will continue to
the end of June for most of the Midwest, reducing yields and
raising the cost of ethanol production.  About 32 percent of the domestic corn crop is under stress,
and temperatures will rise as the plants begin to pollinate,
Chicago-based  T-Storm Weather LLC  said in a report. At least 50
percent of subsoil has been rated below normal since May 31, the
forecaster said.  Producers are losing 10 cents on every gallon of ethanol
made, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 9.4 cents, or 4.5
percent, to $2.164 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  Corn climbed the exchange limit of 40 cents, or 7.2
percent, to $5.94 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. It was
the biggest advance in corn futures since June 30, 2010.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf rose 5.5
cents to $2.18 a gallon, and, on the West Coast, the biofuel
added 6.5 cents, to $2.225, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  jumped 8.5 cents to $2.175 a gallon
and, in Chicago, the additive increased 6 cents to $2.11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
