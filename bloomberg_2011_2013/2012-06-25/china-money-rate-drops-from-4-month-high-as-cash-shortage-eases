China ’s money-market rate dropped
from a four-month high on speculation cash supply will rise once
banks complete month-end  reserve requirements .  Lenders have to park funds with the central bank on the
fifth, 15th and 25th of each month. Policy makers may cut the
reserve ratio for banks “soon” and use reverse repurchase
agreements to improve  money supply  and boost loans, China
Securities Journal reported on its front page, citing
unidentified people in the market.  “The cash shortage is temporarily easing,” said Liu Junyu,
a bond analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-
biggest lender. “The central bank may also inject money to the
financial system by issuing reverse repos this week.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 21 basis points to 4.13 percent as
of 10:58 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched
4.39 percent on June 21, the highest level since Feb. 27. Local
financial markets were shut on June 22 for a holiday.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed four
basis points to 2.72 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.14 percent government bonds due February
2017 was unchanged at 2.93 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Simon Harvey, Sandy Hendry  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
