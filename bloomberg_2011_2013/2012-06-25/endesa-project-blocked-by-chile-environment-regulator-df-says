Environmental regulators in northern
 Chile ’s Atacama region rejected  Empresa Nacional (ENDESA)  de Electricidad
SA’s plan to build a 740-megawatt thermoelectric plant, Diario
Financiero reported.  The environmental impact study for the Punta Alcalde
project, which Endesa plans to build in the city of Huasco, was
rejected eight votes to two by Atacama’s Environmental
Evaluation Commission, the Santiago-based newspaper reported on
its website, without saying where it obtained the information.  An external public relations representative of the company
wasn’t available to comment, an assistant said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
