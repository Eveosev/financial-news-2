The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.3 percent to 565.13 at 4:45 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials gained
0.64 percent to 1419.162.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded below $80 a barrel for a third day in  New York 
after a report indicated that central banks will struggle to
boost global economic growth, threatening demand for fuel.  Oil for August delivery fell as much as 50 cents to $79.26
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $79.40 at 3:36 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract increased $1.56 to $79.76 on June 22. Prices are 20
percent lower this year and have fallen 23 percent this quarter,
the biggest decline since the final three months of 2008.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas  rose for a third day in New York after  Gulf of
Mexico  producers shut production as Tropical Storm Debby
approached.  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore gasoil swaps for July increased 75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $106.55 a barrel at 10:43 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude fell 35 cents, or 2
percent, to $17.05 a barrel. Last week, the spread widened 9.4
percent, the biggest weekly gain since Oct. 21, amid signs that
China’s consumption of diesel outpaced supplies.  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose to $24.68 a metric ton from $23.56 a ton on June
22, according to Bloomberg calculations based on PVM data.  Naphtha swaps for July increased $2.25, or 0.3 percent, to
$711.25 a ton, PVM data showed.  Singapore fuel oil’s premium to Dubai crude narrowed to
$1.01 a barrel from $1.44 on June 22, PVM data showed.  High-sulfur fuel-oil swaps for July jumped $4.25, or 0.7
percent, to $574.75 a ton.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold slid 3.4 percent last week as the  Federal Reserve 
extended Operation Twist, an economic stimulus plan to buy
longer-maturing debt, while refraining from additional
purchases.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1,569.78 an ounce by 9:05 a.m. in  London . Gold has dropped 5.9
percent since the end of March, the worst quarterly performance
since the three months to June 2004. August-delivery futures
were 0.2 percent higher at $1,570.20 on the Comex in New York.  Silver for immediate delivery fell 0.7 percent to $26.735
an ounce after falling to $26.62 on June 22, the lowest price
this year. An ounce of gold bought as much as 58.9 ounces of
silver today, the most since September, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  BASE METALS  Copper gained for the first time in four days, paring a
quarterly drop, on speculation demand from  China , the biggest
user, is improving. Zinc and lead climbed.  Three-month copper rose as much as 1.2 percent to $7,400.25
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, before trading at
$7,336.50 at 3:28 p.m. Shanghai time. The contract is poised to
fall 13 percent this quarter, the worst since the three months
to September 2011, and has lost 3.5 percent this year.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil  gained on speculation that hot, dry weather in
parts of the U.S. will damage soybean crops, potentially
lowering global oilseed supplies.  The September-delivery contract rose as much as 3.6 percent
to 3,059 ringgit ($958) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and was at 3,043 ringgit at 4:03 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .
That pared this quarter’s loss to 11 percent.  Soybeans for November delivery rose as much as 3.6 percent
to $14.2525 a bushel in  Chicago , the highest level since May 18.
December-delivery  soybean oil  rose 2.5 percent to 51.77 cents a
pound. Palm oil and soybean oil are used in foods and fuels.  Rubber jumped by the most in a week as its slump to the
lowest level in more than two years attracted buyers amid
speculation that a rally in oil may boost the price of competing
synthetic products used in tires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
