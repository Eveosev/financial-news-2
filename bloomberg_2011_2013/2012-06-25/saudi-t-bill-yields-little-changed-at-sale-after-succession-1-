Saudi Arabia  treasury-bill yields
were little changed at an auction today as the kingdom completed
a smooth succession after the death of the crown prince.  The yield on the one-year notes was 0.57304 percent
compared with 0.57403 percent at last week’s sale, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on the three-month and
six-month notes were little changed at 0.37380 percent and
0.44975 percent respectively, the data show. The one-week and
one-month bill yields were unchanged at 0.11366 percent and
0.20215 percent.  King Abdullah  appointed on June 18 Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, his defense minister and half brother, as crown
prince after Prince Nayef Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud died in Geneva.  Borrowing costs in Saudi Arabia have risen this year as
lending picked up. The  three-month Saudi interbank average
offered rate , the  reference rate  used by banks to price loans,
has climbed 15 basis points this year to 0.92875 percent today,
the highest since May 2009, according to data on Bloomberg. The
rate’s  spread  over the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate
has more than doubled in the period to 47 basis points.  Loans to private businesses in the kingdom grew 13.4
percent in April from the year earlier, the fastest pace in
three years, after the world’s biggest oil exporter announced
more than $500 billion of projects, according to central bank
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
