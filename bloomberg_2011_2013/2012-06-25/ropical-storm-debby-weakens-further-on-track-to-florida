Tropical Storm Debbyâ€™s top winds
dropped to 45 miles (72 kilometers) per hour as the system moved
toward the  Florida  coast at 3 mph, the National Hurricane Center
said shortly before 11 a.m. East Coast time.  A tropical storm warning was dropped from the Alabama line
east to Destin, Florida. Warnings have now been posted for the
Florida Gulf Coast from Destin to Englewood. Debby, previously a
60-mph storm, is expected to change little in strength in the
next day or two, the center said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
