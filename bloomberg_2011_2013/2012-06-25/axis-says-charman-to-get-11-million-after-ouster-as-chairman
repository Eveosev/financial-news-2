Axis Capital Holdings Ltd. (AXS) , the
Bermuda-based reinsurer, said John Charman will receive $11
million after being ousted as chairman following a dispute over
his role.  Half will be made in a lump sum immediately, and the rest
after one year, the insurer said in a regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
