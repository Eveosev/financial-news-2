Storebrand ASA (STB) ,  Norway ’s second-
largest publicly traded insurer, fell the most in more than four
months in Oslo trading after lowering the reported solvency
ratio at its life insurance unit.  Storebrand fell as much as 9.5 percent, the biggest decline
since Feb. 14, and was down 7.6 percent at 20 kroner as of 11:21
a.m. in the Norwegian capital, making it the biggest decliner on
the  Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index. (BEINSUR)   Storebrand restated the first-quarter solvency ratio for
its life insurance unit to 146 percent from 163 percent after it
received a letter from the Norwegian Financial Supervisory
Authority, or Finanstilsynet, regarding its calculation of the
measure, the Oslo-based company said in a statement. The
solvency ratio is a measure of a company’s capacity to absorb
losses.  “Storebrand’s view has been built on a different
interpretation of the regulation than Finanstilsynet has
communicated,” the company said. “Storebrand Life Insurance
Group will going forward report according to Finanstilsynets
method.”  Storebrand said it had an internal target of 150 percent
for the measure, which is “materially” above the regulator’s
100 percent minimum requirement. The solvency ratio for the
company as a whole and reported profit weren’t affected, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
