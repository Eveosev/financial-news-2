South Africa  extended the June 30
deadline by which wind and solar power-plant developers have to
conclude funding arrangements by two weeks.  “It’s mainly because of some logistical issues on the
government side,” Ompi Aphane, a deputy director general in the
Department of Energy, said by mobile phone from  Pretoria  today.
“One of those would be the regulatory approvals.”  An example is state-owned power utility Eskom Holdings SOC
Ltd., which has to sign contracts to purchase the power
generated by the renewable-energy plants, according to Aphane.  South Africa is expanding its power-generation capacity
after Eskom, which generates most of its power from coal,
suffered shortages in 2008, temporarily shutting gold, platinum
and other mines.  The  Department of Energy  approved 28 renewable-energy
projects, mainly wind and solar plants, in a first bidding
window last year and 19 in a second this year. The deadline for
financial closure for the first-window bidders was June 30.  The department has yet to finalize the date on which it
will open a third bidding round for renewable-power projects,
Aphane said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
