Zimbabwe ’s police denied
investigating the country’s finance minister after a state-
controlled newspaper yesterday reported a probe.  Zimbabwe’s state-controlled  Sunday Mail   cited police
saying they were investigating Tendai Biti, who is also
secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change party,
over a $20 million International Monetary Fund loan deposited in
Zimbabwe’s Interfin Bank, a unit of Interfin Financial Services
Ltd.  Wayne Bvudzijena, the main spokesman for the police, said
in an interview that he hadn’t spoken to the Harare-based
newspaper and was unaware of any probe. Biti didn’t answer calls
to his mobile phone when Bloomberg sought comment today.  Biti’s MDC party shares power with President  Robert
Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front under a
2009 agreement brokered by the  Southern African Development
Community  because elections the previous year were deemed
flawed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
