Drakkar Group SA, the parent company
of animal feed additives unit Adisseo, signed 300 million euros
($375 million) of loans, lenders said in a statement.  The five-year facility for the Brussels-based company is
divided between a term loan and a revolving credit, and was
arranged by bookrunners BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings Plc,
Natixis SA and Rabobank International, according to the e-mailed
statement from BNP. Five further banks participated in the
lending group and the proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
