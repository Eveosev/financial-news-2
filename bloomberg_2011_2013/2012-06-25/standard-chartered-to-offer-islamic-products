Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the British
bank that earns most of its profit from Asia, will begin
offering Islamic financial products to its private-banking
clients to boost its share of a fast-growing market.  The products, which comply with Islam’s ban on interest,
include deposit accounts, property financing, equities, Islamic
bonds or sukuk and mutual funds, the London-based lender said in
a statement before a news conference in Dubai today.  Standard Chartered ’s five-year-old private-banking business
manages more than $50 billion in assets and reported a 21
percent rise in revenue in 2011 to more than $500 million, the
bank said. Islamic banking industry assets are growing twice as
fast as those of conventional banks and are estimated to reach
$1.1 trillion by the end of 2012, up 33 percent from 2010, the
bank said today, citing data from Ernst & Young LLP.  The market for Islamic investment products is “under-
served,”  Stephen Evans , regional head of private banking for
 Europe ,  Middle East , India, Africa and Americas, told reporters
today. Of the world’s 1.6 billion muslims, only 14 percent bank
“Islamically,” in part because the industry doesn’t offer
sufficient products, he said.  The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, has more than
500,000 individuals with investable assets totaling more than
$1.7 trillion, Evans said.  Standard Chartered Saadiq, the lender’s Islamic banking
business, has 270,000 retail and small and medium-sized
companies as customers, Evans said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
