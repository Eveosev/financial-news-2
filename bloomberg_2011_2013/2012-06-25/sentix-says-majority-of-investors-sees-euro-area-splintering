least one country to leave the 17-nation euro area within a
year, the Sentix research institute said, citing a survey.  Some 56 percent of the 1,000 investors polled predicted the

said in an e-mailed statement today. Of those, 89 percent said
Greece was the most likely country to leave, 5.3 percent
predicted Germany and 1.3 percent thought  Spain , Sentix said.  Sentix plans to publish its new “Euro Breakup Risk Index”
