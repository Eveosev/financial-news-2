OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell for a fourth day, leading a drop in the country’s
shares, on concern the country will follow bigger economies in
 Europe  into recession.  OTP’s shares dropped 2.1 percent to 3,460 forint by 12:12
p.m. in Budapest, bringing its decline in the past four trading
days to 8.5 percent, the most on a closing basis since the four
days through May 17. The benchmark BUX stock index slid 1.2
percent today to 17,028.31.  Hungarian retail sales dropped the most since 2010 in April
as purchases of electronic goods and furniture slumped, the
statistics office in Budapest said today in an e-mailed report.  European stocks declined for a third day as  George Soros 
warned that failure by leaders to produce drastic measures at a
summit this week could spell the demise of the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
