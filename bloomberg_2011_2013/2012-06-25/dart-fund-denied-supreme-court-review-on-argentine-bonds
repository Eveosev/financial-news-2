Two funds, one controlled by
billionaire Kenneth Dart, lost a U.S. Supreme Court bid to
collect at least $2 billion owed by the government of  Argentina .  The justices today refused to hear an appeal by Dart’s EM
Ltd. and NML Capital Ltd., an affiliate of the New York-based
hedge fund Elliott Associates LP, in a multi-pronged dispute
stemming from Argentina’s 2001 default on $95 billion of bonds.  The funds, which refused to exchange their securities in a
2005 Argentine debt swap, have been seeking to enforce $2
billion in judgments they have won in U.S. court cases.  EM and NML were trying to seize $100 million in Argentine
central bank assets being held at the Federal Reserve Bank in
 New York . A federal appeals court said that money is shielded
under the U.S. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  Dart is president of Mason, Michigan-based Dart Container
Corp., the world’s largest maker of foam cups. He gave up his
U.S. citizenship in the 1990s to avoid taxes and moved to the
 Cayman Islands .  U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, asked by the court
for the Obama administration’s views, urged the justices to deny
review. The appeals court decision is correct and doesn’t
conflict with any other appellate ruling, he wrote.  Justice  Sonia Sotomayor  didn’t take part in today’s action.
She was involved in the litigation over Argentina’s bonds as an
appeals court judge.  The case is EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 11-604.  To contact the reporter on this story:
