Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , the
Serbian oil and gas company controlled by Russia’s  OAO Gazprom
Neft (GAZP) , will use last year’s profits to cover accumulated losses.  NIS’s net income almost tripled to 40.6 billion dinars
($442.05 million) in 2011 on expanded output and a stable dinar
exchange rate that helped keep costs in check, the company said
in an e-mail today.  “All the losses have been covered and there’s nothing else
remaining from the past times,” board member Slobodan Milosavljevic said.  The Novi Sad-based refiner promised shareholders to pay at
least 15 percent of net as a dividend from next year as part of
a long-term dividend strategy, it said in the statement after a
shareholders meeting.  The company’s shares closed at 601 dinars on the Belgrade
Stock Exchange, 0.17 percent up on the previous trading session.  To contact the reporters on this story:
