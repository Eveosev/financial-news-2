Russian fund manager Kazimir
Partners hired Tom Adshead from Sito Capital as head of
research.  Adshead started at the firm’s Moscow office on June 21, he
said today in an e-mail, after quitting hedge fund Sito Capital,
where he was head of research since 2007.  Adshead was previously head of research at investment bank
United Financial Group in Moscow and a senior analyst at Troika
Dialog before switching to  portfolio management  at Alfa Capital
in 2006.  Kazimir, which has offices in Moscow, London and  New York ,
was set up by Frank Mosier and Dmitri Kryukov in 2002 after they
left investment bank  Renaissance Capital . Kryukov left in 2009
and has since started a hedge fund firm, Verno Capital, and
hired former colleagues from Kazimir.  To contact the reporter on this story:
