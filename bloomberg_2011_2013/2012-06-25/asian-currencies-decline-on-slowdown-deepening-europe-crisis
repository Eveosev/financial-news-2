Asian currencies fell to a two-week
low, led by  Indonesia ’s rupiah, on concern Europe’s worsening
debt crisis will slow global growth.  South Korea’s won and the Philippine peso both dropped for
a third day as regional stocks declined. France and Italy are
urging  Germany  to take decisive action ahead of a two-day summit
in  Belgium  from June 28 after Spain’s 10-year bond yields rose
above 7 percent last week.  China ’s yuan slid the most since
April 5, while India is due to announce plans today to support
the rupee.  “Hopes are high but optimistic expectations on Europe are
at risk of being disappointed,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency
strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “The market is also
anxious for a greater policy response as the soft economic patch
is at risk of worsening.”  Indonesia’s rupiah weakened 0.5 percent to 9,485 per dollar
as of 9:31 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  Thailand ’s baht declined 0.4 percent to
31.89, the won fell 0.3 percent to 1,160.90 per dollar, the peso
dropped 0.4 percent to 42.635 and the  yuan  lost 0.20 percent to
6.3771.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell 0.16 percent
and touched its lowest level since June 8. The gauge’s 60-day
historical volatility rose to 2.92 percent from 2.91 percent.
The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks fell 0.4 percent, a third
day of losses.  Rupee Measures  Thailand’s baht fell to a three-week low after overseas
investors cut net holdings of the nation’s stocks by $140
million last week. A government report will show today exports
rose 0.5 percent in May from a year earlier after declining 3.67
percent in April, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “Foreigners have been net sellers in Thailand for quite
some time and that put downward pressure on the baht,” said
Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank
Pcl. “Sentiment remains weak until the EU summit.”  India plans to announce measures today to support the rupee
after the currency slumped to record-low of 57.3275 per dollar
on June 22, Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said yesterday.
The rupee is Asia’s worst-performing currency this year, losing
6.4 percent.  The yuan reached its weakest level in seven months after
the People’s Bank of China set its  reference rate  0.30 percent
lower at 6.3230 per dollar.  “We had seen big moves in the U.S. dollar crosses versus
the euro, yen and Aussie dollar,” said  Robert Minikin , a senior
strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in  Hong Kong . The weaker
yuan also reflects the unwinding of gains following strong
fixings before the Group of 20 meeting last week, he said.  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit was little changed at 3.1930
per dollar. Taiwan’s dollar was steady at NT$29.962, while the
Vietnamese dong climbed 1.1 percent to 20,910.  To contact the reporters on this story:
