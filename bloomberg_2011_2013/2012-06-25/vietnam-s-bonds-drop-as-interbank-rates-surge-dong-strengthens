Vietnam ’s three-year bonds dropped,
pushing their yield to a six-week high, as surging money-market
rates deterred investors from buying sovereign debt. The dong
strengthened the most since March.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  jumped 115 basis
points to a two-month high of 5.98 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. “Bond yields increased as investors
rushed to sell risk-free assets after seeing interbank interest
rates rose significantly,” said Ho Chi Minh City-based Nguyen
Duy Phong, an analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co.  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark three-year bonds
rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 9.6
percent, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since May 10.  The dong strengthened 1.1 percent to 20,918 per dollar as
of 4:38 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828, a level
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
