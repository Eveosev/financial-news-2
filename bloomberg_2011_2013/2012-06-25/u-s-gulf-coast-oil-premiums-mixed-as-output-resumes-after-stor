U.S. Gulf Coast sweet oils weakened
and sour crudes strengthened against benchmark West Texas
Intermediate as offshore producers resumed output after Tropical
Storm Debby moved away from platforms.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is returning workers and starting
production in the U.S.  Gulf of Mexico  that was shut because of
the storm, the company said in a statement on its website.  BHP
Billiton  will resume output tomorrow at its Gulf platforms,
Victor Cock, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  About 44 percent of U.S. oil output and 35 percent of
natural gas production from the Gulf of  Mexico  are shut because
of Tropical Storm Debby, a Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement report today showed.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
lost $1.50 a barrel to $13.50 at 4:08 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
decreased $1.50 to $12.25 over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium to WTI added 25 cents to $8.25 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $7.10. Mars
Blend’s premium added 25 cents to $9.25 a barrel.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, added $1.45 to $12.45
a barrel over WTI.  Bakken oil’s discount was steady at $6 a barrel below the
U.S. benchmark.  Syncrude’s discount was unchanged at $2.75 below WTI.
Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like bitumen in
 Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount was steady at $23.50 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
