Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) ,
 Australia â€™s largest surf-wear maker, slumped in Sydney trading
after selling A$155 million ($155 million) of new shares to
institutional investors at a discount.  The stock declined 36 percent to 93 Australian cents at
10:59 a.m. in Sydney, the most since Dec. 19, as it resumed
trade for the first time since June 20. About 79 percent of
entitlements were taken up as investors were able to buy six
shares at A$1.02 apiece for every seven they already owned,  Gold
Coast , Australia-based Billabong said in a filing today.  The offer of shares to individual shareholders will start
June 29 with the company planning to raise a total of A$225
million, it said.  The maker of Kustom shoes and Billabong clothing has had
its  recommendation  cut to sell by analysts at Citigroup Inc. and
UBS AG since reducing its earnings target on June 21 and
announcing the share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
