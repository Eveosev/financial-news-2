Old Republic International Corp. (ORI) 
plunged for a second day after withdrawing a plan to spin off
its mortgage-guaranty operation that ran short of capital.  The shares declined 10 percent to $8.33 at 4:02 p.m. in New
York trading, after slumping 12 percent on June 22.  Old Republic is seeking to focus on products such as title
insurance and commercial-liability coverage and limit losses
from backing home loans. The separation would have diminished
liquidity concerns at Old Republic and could have led to an
upgrade of the insurer’s debt,  Fitch Ratings  said last month.  “A successful spinoff would mitigate Fitch’s concern
regarding a potential covenant breach under ORI’s debt
obligations and eliminate the cash drain” related to mortgage
insurance, Fitch said in a May 23 statement.  Old Republic canceled the plan to spin off its Republic
Financial Indemnity Group unit in response to “objections
raised by certain stakeholders that RFIG’s separation from Old
Republic would be disadvantageous to their interests and
expectations,” the Chicago-based insurer said in a June 22
statement.  Old Republic didn’t identify the stakeholders in the
statement and has scheduled a conference call for 11 a.m.  New
York  time tomorrow to discuss the withdrawal of the spinoff
plan, according to a statement.  Editors: Dan Kraut, Steve Dickson  To contact the reporter on this story:
