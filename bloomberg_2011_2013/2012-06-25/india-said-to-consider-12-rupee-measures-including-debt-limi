Foreign investment limits in Indian
debt may be increased as policy makers consider as many as 12
measures to halt the rupee’s 20 percent depreciation in the past
year, a government official familiar with the plan said.  India ’s Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  and central bank
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao will today also discuss easing rules
for investment in infrastructure bonds, said the official, who
asked not to be identified because the details are not yet
public.  India plans to unveil measures today to support the rupee
as its slump to a record low against the dollar threatens to
intensify price pressures and boost the cost to companies of
repaying foreign debt, Mukherjee said in Kolkata on June 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
