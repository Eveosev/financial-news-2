Banco Santander SA (SAN)  Chairman  Emilio Botin  said the Spanish bank seeks to hold an initial public
offering of its Mexican unit on Oct. 4 to take advantage of
growth in Latin America’s second-largest economy.  “ Mexico  has some extremely good years ahead of it --
extremely good,” Botin said during an event today in Boadilla
del Monte, Spain, according to an e-mailed transcript of his
remarks. “The economy is doing well and we see the country with
still a lot of untapped banking needs.”  The bank, Mexico’s fourth largest by outstanding loans, has
seen widespread investor interest in the sale, Botin said. The
offering will depend on market conditions, he said.  “We are giving enormous importance to listing in Mexico,
we’re being called to do so from all sides,” he said. “I have
never received more letters from international banks that want
to participate in this operation.”  International market volatility from Europe’s debt crisis
has discouraged public share offerings in Mexico, Bolsa Mexicana
de Valores SAB Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Luis Tellez 
said on May 31. Bolsa Mexicana operates the nation’s stock
exchange.  Mexico’s last IPO was Alpek SAB, the nation’s largest
petrochemical company, on April 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
