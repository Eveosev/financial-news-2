OAO Severstal (CHMF) ,  Russia ’s second-
largest steelmaker, will purchase about 20 percent of the
equities offered by shareholders in a buyback announced in
February following the spinoff of its Nordgold NV unit.  Severstal will buy back 170 million of the 864.8 million
shares offered by holders, it said today in a statement. The
company will complete the repurchase, representing 17 percent of
its capital, at 390 rubles ($11.73) a share by July 4.  The producer announced the buyback after shares accumulated
in its Lybica unit because Severstal holders exchanged their
stock for Nordgold equities as part of the unit’s spinoff.  Minorities offered 5 percent of their stock, with the rest
from Lybica, said Kirill Chuyko, a  UBS AG (UBSN)  analyst. As a result
Severstal will buy 1 percent of minorities’ shares, Chuyko said.  Severstal will cancel the 17 percent holding it buys back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
