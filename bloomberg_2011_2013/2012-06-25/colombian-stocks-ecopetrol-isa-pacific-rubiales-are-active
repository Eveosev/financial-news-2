The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in

Colcap Index slid 2.4 percent to 1,593.97.  Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA CB), an energy and road

it sent workers to repair a damaged energy tower in the eastern
province of Arauca, close to the border with  Venezuela ,
according to a  statement  on the company’s website. The damage
was caused by an attack by rebels, the army said.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , which operates the
country’s largest oil field, fell 3.1 percent to 37,000 pesos.
“As a result of the delays to permitting, we expect average
production in 2012 to be below management expectations,” CIBC
World Markets Inc. analyst Ian Macqueen wrote in an e-mailed
report yesterday. Pacific Rubiales “has underperformed of late
and could continue to do so until permits are granted.”  Colombia  is speeding up environmental permitting for  oil
companies , Orlando Cabrales, president of the state-run oil
regulator, said on June 19. Fields awaiting permits include
Rubiales, the nation’s largest, he said.  Other oil producers dropped as crude fell below $80 a
barrel for a third day in New York.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based  oil
company  that operates fields in Colombia, dropped 3.5 percent to
820 pesos, the lowest close on record.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , the country’s largest oil company, slumped 4.5 percent to

Andean region, decreased 1.4 percent to 19,800 pesos, the lowest
