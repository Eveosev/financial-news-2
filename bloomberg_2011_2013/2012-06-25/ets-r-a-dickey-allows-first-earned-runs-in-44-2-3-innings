New York Mets pitcher R.A. Dickey
gave up four runs in the third inning of tonight’s game against
the New York Yankees, halting his streak of 44 2/3 consecutive
innings without allowing an earned run.  Dickey, who entered the game with an 11-1 record and a 2.00
earned run average, gave up a bases-loaded sacrifice fly to  Mark
Teixeira  and then surrendered a three-run home run to  Nick
Swisher  as the Yankees opened a 4-0 lead.  Dickey had gone 6-0 with a 0.18 ERA over his previous six
starts and was coming off consecutive 1-hitters, the first Major
League Baseball pitcher to do so since Toronto’s Dave Stieb in
1988.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
