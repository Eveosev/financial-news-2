South Korean consumer confidence
dropped to the lowest level in three months as  Europe ’s debt
woes dimmed the outlook for Asia’s fourth-largest economy.  The  sentiment index  was at 101 in June after reaching 105
in May, the  Bank of Korea  said in an e-mailed statement today. A
reading above 100 indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.  The Bank of  Korea  indicated on June 21 it may cut its 2012
growth forecast in July for the second time this year as
Europe’s crisis worsens. German Chancellor Angela Merkel
yesterday rejected joint euro-area bonds as European Union
leaders struggle to agree on a plan ahead of a two-day summit
this week.  “The European debt woes are finally hurting consumer
sentiment here and this is a bad sign for our economy as exports
are already declining,” said Lee Sang Jae, a senior economist
at Hyundai Securities Co. in  Seoul . “The authorities may have
to come up with stimulus such as interest rate cuts should the
EU continue to heavily weigh on consumer and business sentiment
around the world.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.2 percent as
of 9:21 a.m. in Tokyo.  The expected inflation rate over the next year was 3.7
percent in June, unchanged from last month, today’s report
showed. Consumer inflation held at a 21-month low of 2.5 percent
in May.  The  consumer confidence  index is based on survey responses
from 2,072 households in 56 cities. It was conducted by mail and
telephone between June 12 and June 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
