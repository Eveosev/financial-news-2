Uganda  is considering a law to allow
genetically modified crops to boost production, according to an
industry group supporting biotech crops.  A bill is being considered after successful introduction of
the genetically modified crops in India, South Africa, Egypt and
Burkino Faso, the Uganda Biotechnology and Biosafety Consortium
said in a statement today from Kampala, the capital. Possible
crops include bananas, corn, cotton and cassava, it said.  Uganda is testing biotech cassava to fight cassava brown
streak virus, which causes deadly streaks in the roots. Biotech
corn would be resistant to drought, cotton to bollworm and
bananas to wilting, the Uganda consortium said.  Editors: Claudia Carpenter, Dan Weeks  To contact the reporter on this story:
