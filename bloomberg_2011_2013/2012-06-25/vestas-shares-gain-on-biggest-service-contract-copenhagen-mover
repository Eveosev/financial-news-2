Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  was the
biggest winner on Copenhagen’s benchmark index today after the
world’s largest wind turbine maker won its biggest service
contract to date.  Vestas rose as much as 2.7 percent, today’s biggest jump in
the Copenhagen 20 Index. The  stock  advanced 0.13 krone, or 0.4
percent, to 30.45 kroner at 10:13 a.m. in the Danish capital.
The shares of the Aarhus, Denmark-based company were down as
much as 0.9 percent before the announcement.  Vestas said today it will provide maintenance for as long
as seven years on more than 1,100 U.S. and European wind turbine
owned by  EDP Renovaveis SA. (EDPR)  Vestas said Feb. 8 that its service
business is now more profitable than the division that sells
 wind turbines , and that it will be its fastest growing business
going forward.  To contact the reporter on this story:
