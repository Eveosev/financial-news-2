Rambus Inc. (RMBS) , a designer of computer
memory chips that makes its most of its money from royalties,
named Ronald Black as president and chief executive officer,
picking a successor to Harold Hughes.  Black previously served as CEO for MobiWire, formerly Sagem
Wireless, and other companies, Rambus said today in a statement.
He also was an executive vice president at Agere Systems and
held senior management roles at Motorola and International
Business Machines Corp.’s Microelectronics division.  The new CEO will have to chart a comeback for Rambus after
a legal defeat on Nov. 16. The Sunnyvale, California-based
company lost a $3.95 billion  jury trial  over allegations that
 Micron Technology Inc. (MU)  and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. conspired to
prevent Rambus chips from becoming an industry standard.
Rambus’s shares plunged 61 percent the day of the decision.  “Ron’s experience in managing through complex businesses
at various levels and helping them achieve objectives make him
an excellent fit for the next phase of Rambus,” Chairman J. Thomas Bentley said today in the statement.  Rambus shares  fell 3.4 percent to $5.44 at the close in  New
York . They have tumbled 28 percent this year.  Hughes, 66, will stay at Rambus as a board member, Bentley
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
