SAIC Inc. (SAI) , which provides technology
services to the U.S. government, has protested the loss of its
biggest federal contract to  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)   Lockheed, the nation’s largest defense contractor, on June
15 beat SAIC for the Defense Department contract valued at as
much as $4.6 billion to operate a communications network known
as the Global Information Grid.  SAIC filed its challenge on June 22 with the U.S.
Government Accountability Office, which arbitrates contract
disputes. Shares of the McLean, Virginia-based company fell 1.2
percent to close at $11.72 in  New York  trading. Its shares have
fallen 4.6 percent this year.  “We are disappointed in the government’s decision to not
award us” the contract, Melissa Koskovich, a spokeswoman for
SAIC, said in a statement late yesterday. “We feel our solution
is the best value for the customer and we are proud of our
performance history on this contract.”  SAIC gets more than 90 percent of its revenue from work for
the federal government. The company had $10.6 billion in revenue
in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31.  The contract is for as long as seven years if all options
are exercised, and its estimated value for the three-year base
period is $1.91 billion.  SAIC, the eighth-largest contractor on the Bloomberg
Government top 200 list, has received at least $3.6 billion for
the work since 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
