Saudi Arabia  won’t reduce oil
production in the coming three months even if oil prices
continue to drop, Asharq al-Awsat newspaper reported, citing
unidentified people aware of the country’s output plans.  The desert kingdom’s daily rate of crude production will
range from 9.7 million to 10 million barrels in the next three
months, the London-based pan-Arab  daily  said, citing the people.
These levels are similar to the country’s pumping rate of the
past few months, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
