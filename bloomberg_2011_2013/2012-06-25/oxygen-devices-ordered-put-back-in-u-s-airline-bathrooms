Airlines must put redesigned oxygen
systems back in aircraft lavatories, one year after they were
ordered removed on concerns they could be used by terrorists as
weapons, the U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  said.  Airlines have 37 months to install new oxygen supplies,
according to a  directive  published today on the U.S. Federal
Register’s website. The rule doesn’t specify the new standards.  Oxygen supplies, required in the event an aircraft loses
cabin pressure at high altitude, last year were deemed a hazard
in lavatories because passengers could tamper with them,
according to a statement issued last year by the FAA. The pure
oxygen could be used to start a fire, according to the
statement.  The FAA, working with the  Transportation Security
Administration  and the FBI, ordered the oxygen systems disabled
in lavatories on March 8, 2011. It was working with industry to
find a tamper-proof oxygen system, according to last year’s
statement.  Most oxygen systems are cans containing chemicals that,
when activated, cause a reaction producing pure oxygen.  The costs to the airline industry of installing the new
systems is estimated to be $44.2 million, the FAA said. It cost
airlines $935,000 to disable the old devices. The rule applies
to about 5,500 aircraft in the U.S., according to the directive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
