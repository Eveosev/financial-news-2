(Corrects days of strike in headline, first paragraph.)  A nationwide strike by Bolivian
police entered its fifth day with officers clashing with
supporters of President  Evo Morales  in La Paz after the rank-
and-file yesterday rejected the government’s proposed pay
increase.  The strikers are demanding a wage increase of about $100
per month to put them on par with basic military salaries of
about $300 a month. Police protesters rejected a deal with the
government signed by their representatives yesterday that called
for a $30 increase, claiming they were not consulted on the
agreement, according to local news outlet Erbol.  High ranking police officers have not joined the strike,
and cadets from the police academy are currently working to
control traffic throughout the city of La Paz. Morales said
Sunday that the military has not been called on to patrol the
nation’s cities.  Morales yesterday said right-wing forces had infiltrated
the police protest, after Interior Minister Carlos Romero
claimed government intelligence reveals protesters’ plans to
assassinate the minister and set the stage for a coup.  “They use some of our brothers in the police to ready a
coup, and to plan to kill the minister of interior, and to clash
with the armed forces,” Morales said according to State
newswire  ABI .  To contact the reporter on this story:
