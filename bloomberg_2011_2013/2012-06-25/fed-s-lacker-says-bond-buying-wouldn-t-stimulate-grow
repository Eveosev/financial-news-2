Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said additional Fed purchases of bonds
known as quantitative easing wouldn’t spur the U.S. expansion,
which is hindered by concerns such as fiscal policy.  “ Monetary policy  doesn’t have a lot of capability right
now for really enhancing the growth we are seeing on the
economy,” Lacker said in a Fox Business Network interview
posted online today. “The impediments to growth are things that
monetary policy is not that capable of offsetting.”  The Richmond Fed leader said additional bond purchases are
not “a forgone conclusion. We take everything a meeting at a
time. It is going to depend on how the data comes out.”  While growth has weakened in recent months, there has been
a pattern of moving from strong to weak growth in the three-year
recovery, he said.  Central bank officials on June 20 downgraded their
forecasts for growth and employment while noting “significant
downside risks” to the economy. Lacker dissented last week from
the Fed’s $267 billion extension of its Operation Twist program,
believing it would spur inflation and not significantly help the
economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
