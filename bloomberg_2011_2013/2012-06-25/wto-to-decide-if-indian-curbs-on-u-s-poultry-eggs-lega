The  World Trade Organization  agreed
to investigate Indian restrictions on U.S. poultry meat and eggs
and decide whether the curbs break global commerce rules.  India  has prohibited imports of various U.S. farm products
since at least February 2007, saying the ban is needed to
prevent the spread of low-pathogenic avian influenza. U.S. Trade
Representative  Ron Kirk ’s office accuses India of ignoring
scientific evidence while the Department of Agriculture says
low-pathogenic bird flu causes “minor illness, poses no risk to
human health and sometimes manifests no clinical signs.”  The U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council, which estimates
the value of poultry-product exports to India could exceed $300
million a year, has called the curbs a “protectionist policy
that is inconsistent with accepted international standards, and
has no health or safety justification.” India’s import policies
affect mostly poultry meat as the country is a net exporter of
eggs, according to the council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
