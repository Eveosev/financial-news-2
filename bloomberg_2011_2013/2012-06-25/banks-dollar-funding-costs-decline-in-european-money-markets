The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell for the first time in three days,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 53 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:50 a.m. in
 London , from minus 54.5 on June 22, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The measure reached 59 basis points on June 4, the
most expensive level in 2 1/2 months.  The one-year basis swap was 52 basis points below Euribor
from minus 51 on June 22. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. Euribor is the rate  banks  say they see each other lending
in euros and is derived from a survey by the European Banking
Federation.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to a gauge of overnight borrowing costs or overnight
indexed swaps -- known as the  FRA/OIS spread  -- were little
changed at 27 basis points. The Euribor/Eonia OIS spread widened
to 44 basis points from 43.  The Eonia OIS swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, fell to 21.8 basis
points from 22. The measure held below the  European Central
Bank ’s deposit rate of 25 basis points for the sixth day.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
ECB on June 22, placing 775 billion euros ($968 billion) from
770 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
