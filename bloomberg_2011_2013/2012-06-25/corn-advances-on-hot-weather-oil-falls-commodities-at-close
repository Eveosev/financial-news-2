The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.7 percent to 567.6 at 4:49 p.m. in  New
York  after corn and soybeans gained on speculation that dry
weather will reduce yields in the U.S.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials rose 1.2
percent to 1427.014.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn gained the most in almost two years and soybeans
jumped to a five-week high on speculation that unusually hot,
dry weather will reduce yields in the U.S., the world’s biggest
producer of both crops.  Dry weather during the next 10 days and intensifying heat
will increase plant stress in the U.S., where 57 percent of
projected production areas have been drier than usual in the
past 30 days compared with about 10 percent a year earlier, T-
Storm Weather LLC said in a report. June is expected to be the
driest since 1988. Corn is beginning to reproduce, the most
critical time for moisture.  Less than 10 percent of the normal amount of rain fell in
parts of Iowa and  Illinois , the biggest U.S. producers of corn
and soybeans, in the past month, National Weather Service data
show. The hot, dry weather may curb corn production that was
forecast to be a record 14.8 billion bushels after U.S. growers
planted 95.9 million acres, the most since 1937.  Corn futures for December delivery surged the exchange
limit of 40 cents, or 7.2 percent, to settle at $5.94 a bushelon
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the biggest gain since June 30,
2010.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 3.6 percent to
$14.255 a bushel in Chicago. Earlier, the price touched $14.37,
the highest since May 18.  Wheat futures for September delivery climbed 7.8 percent to
$7.41 a bushel in Chicago, the most since March 30. The most-
active contract has gained 14 percent this year.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell below $80 a barrel for a third day in New York on
concern that a meeting of European Union leaders this week will
fail to check the region’s debt crisis, leading to a reduction
in fuel demand.  Futures dropped 0.7 percent as  George Soros  warned that a
failure by EU leaders to produce drastic measures may spell the
demise of the bloc’s shared currency. Crude climbed earlier as
oil and gas installations in the Gulf of Mexico were shut
because of Tropical Storm Debby. Prices slid as the storm moved
toward  Florida  and away from energy fields.  Oil for August delivery declined 55 cents to settle at
$79.21 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures are
down 20 percent this year. Prices have fallen 23 percent since
the end of March, heading for the biggest quarterly decline
since the final three months of 2008.  Brent oil for August settlement rose 3 cents to end the
session at $91.01 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. The European benchmark’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate, the crude grade traded in New York, was at $11.80,
up from $11.22 on June 22.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline surged the most in six months on speculation that
refinery closures in  North America  and Europe will make summer-
blend gasoline inventories tight along the U.S. East Coast.  Futures rose 3 percent after the U.K.’s Coryton refinery
stopped operating, at least the sixth European plant to close
since the start of 2011. Hovensa LLC’s St. Croix refinery in the
 U.S. Virgin Islands  is shut and Monroe Energy LLC isn’t expected
to open the idled Trainer,  Pennsylvania , refinery in time for
the summer driving season.  July-delivery gasoline rose 7.59 cents, to settle at
$2.6458 a gallon on the Nymex, the biggest gain since Dec. 20.
The premium to the August contract widened 4.53 cents to 14.76
cents, the most since Aug. 31.  Sunoco Inc. shut a vacuum tower associated with the 137
crude unit for repairs at the 355,000-barrel-a-day Philadelphia
refinery on June 20, a notice to city regulators shows.  The closing of Coryton and other plants in Europe has
reduced imports into New York Harbor, the delivery point for the
Nymex futures contract. U.S. East Coast gasoline imports have
averaged 612,000 barrels a day so far this year, down from
789,000 barrels a day during the same period in 2011.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures gained the most in three weeks as European
debt concerns mounted, spurring demand for the metal as a hedge.  Failure by leaders at this week’s summit to come up with
measures to shore up the weakest countries’ finances may be
“fatal” for the euro, billionaire investor George Soros said
yesterday, while German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  rejected joint
euro-area bonds or bills. Holdings in exchange-traded products
backed by gold approached a record high.  Gold futures for August delivery advanced 1.4 percent to
settle at $1,588.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since June 1.  Silver futures for September delivery climbed 3.2 percent
to $27.587 an ounce, the biggest gain since June 6.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for October delivery rose
0.5 percent to $1,442.70 an ounce, ending a six-session slide.
Palladium futures for September delivery gained 5 cents to
$607.25 an ounce.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee futures rose on supply concerns in  Brazil , the
world’s top producer and exporter. Sugar also gained.  Brazil’s National Coffee Council, a group that represents
producers, said on June 22 that heavy rain is hurting the crop
and the quality of the beans, possibly curbing exports and
domestic sales.  Arabica coffee for September delivery increased 1.8 percent
to settle at $1.5875 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
The price climbed 2.6 percent last week.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery rose 0.9 percent to
19.93 cents a pound in New York. On June 22, the price plunged 5
percent, the most in five months.  Cocoa futures for September delivery were unchanged at
$2,102 a metric ton.  In  London  futures trading, robusta coffee slid, and refined
sugar gained on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa was unchanged.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas rose to a one-month high in New York as
production shutdowns in the  Gulf of Mexico  caused by Tropical
Storm Debby limited supplies.  The futures gained 2.6 percent as about 35 percent of gas
output in the Gulf was shut as of 12:30 p.m., up from 23 percent
yesterday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement said. Demand may rise from  power plants  in the
Midwest because of a heat wave this week, according to National
Weather Service forecasts.  Natural gas for July delivery gained 6.9 cents to $2.694
per million British thermal units on the Nymex, the highest
settlement price since May 23. The futures have advanced 42
percent since dropping to a 10-year low of $1.902 on April 19.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures declined to a six-week low on signs of
increasing animal supplies amid dwindling demand. Hog prices
declined to the lowest this month.  Feedlots bought 15 percent more cattle last month than in
May 2011, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a report
after the close of regular trading on June 22. Fourteen analysts
in a Bloomberg survey forecast a gain of 12 percent, on average.
Feedlots sold about 2.015 million animals to meatpackers in May,
up 0.6 percent from a year earlier. Analysts projected a 4.4
percent increase.  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.9 percent to
settle at $1.15875 a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Earlier, the price touched $1.15725, the lowest for a most-
active contract since May 10. The commodity has fallen 4.6
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement tumbled by the
exchange limit of 3 cents, or 2 percent, to settle at $1.498 a
pound. That’s the lowest since April 11.  Hog futures for August settlement declined 2.4 percent to
settle at 89.15 cents a pound. Prices reached 88.95 cents after
the close of regular trading, the lowest since May 31. The
commodity has climbed 5.8 percent this year.  Pork stockpiles in the U.S. surged 16 percent at the end of
May from a year earlier to the highest ever for the date, the
USDA said in a separate report on June 22.  BASE METALS  Copper rose for the second straight session in New York as
new-home sales in the U.S. reached a two-year high, signaling
prospects for higher metal demand.  Home purchases climbed to a 369,000 annual rate last month,
the most since April 2010 and above the 347,000 median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The number of houses on the
market held close to a record low. The Copper Development
Association says construction generates about 40 percent of
demand for the metal used in pipes and wiring.  Copper futures for September delivery gained 0.3 percent to
settle at $3.3325 a pound on the Comex in New York. On June 22,
the price climbed 0.3 percent.  Aluminum and zinc rose in London, while nickel, tin and
lead fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
