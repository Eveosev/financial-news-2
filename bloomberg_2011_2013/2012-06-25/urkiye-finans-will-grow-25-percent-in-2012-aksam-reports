Turkiye Finans Katilim Bankası AS, a
Turkish bank that operates according to Islamic rules barring
interest, will grow 25 percent this year,  Aksam  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Derya Gurerk.  The shareholders are committed to increasing the bank’s
capital to achieve a capital adequacy ratio that will support
this rate of growth, Gurerk said, according to the newspaper.  National Commercial Bank  of  Saudi Arabia  owns 64.7 percent
of Turkiye Finans, Turkish Boydak Group 21.6 percent and Yildiz
Group 13.7 percent.  Turkiye Finans will have more than 200 branches in Turkey
by year-end and Gurerk said National Commercial Bank is
“enthusiatic” about growth in the country, Aksam reported.  Istanbul, Turkey’s main city, can easily become a center of
 Islamic finance , the newspaper cited Gurerk as saying.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
