Hershey Co. (HSY)  Chief Executive Officer
John P. Bilbrey said acquisitions will be the priority for the
chocolate maker’s cash as the company looks to take
confectionery-market share in  North America  and expand abroad.  The company sees $10 billion in potential local and
regional acquisitions across the globe, Chief Growth Officer
Michele Buck said today during an investor meeting in  New York 
that was webcast. Including other categories such as sweet
snacks, acquisition opportunities total as much as $30 billion,
Buck said.  Hershey is seeking to surpass Mars Inc. to become the
largest confectionery company in North America. The 2008
purchase of Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. by Mars created the world’s
biggest candy maker. Hershey is targeting China to be its
second-largest market, after the U.S., within five years as it
strives to boost revenue to $10 billion. Last year, Hershey had
sales of $6.1 billion. The company also sees significant
opportunity in India.  The Hershey, Pennsylvania-based chocolate maker passed on a
chance to buy Cadbury Plc in 2010.  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  purchased
Cadbury that year. Hershey had $567.3 million in cash and
equivalents on April 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hershey fell 0.5 percent to $69.18 at 11:01 a.m. in New
York. The shares had risen 12 percent this year through June 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
