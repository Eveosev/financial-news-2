New Jersey Democrats, who control
the state Legislature, passed a $31.7 billion budget that
Governor  Chris Christie , a Republican, has signaled he may
oppose because it would delay a tax cut for residents.  The Assembly passed the measure 48-31, sending the spending
plan to Christie, who has objected to conditions put on tax
relief for residential property owners.  To contact the reporters on this story:
