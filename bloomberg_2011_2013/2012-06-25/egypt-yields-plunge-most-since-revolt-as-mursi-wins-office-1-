Egypt ’s benchmark dollar-bond yield
tumbled the most since the early days of last year’s uprising,
and stocks posted the biggest gain since 2008 after Islamist
Mohamed Mursi won the first free presidential election.  The yield on the 5.75 percent notes due 2020 plunged 66
basis points, or 0.66 of a percentage point, to 7.21 percent at
2:49 p.m. in Cairo, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the
biggest drop on a closing basis since February 2011. The rate
surged 97 basis points last week in the runup to the
announcement. The benchmark stock  index  soared 7.6 percent.  In his first televised address last night, Mursi, who won
against Ahmed Shafik,  Hosni Mubarak ’s last premier, called for
national unity, and promised to honor international treaties and
work to build a “modern, constitutional” state. He saluted the
people killed during the uprising and their families and also
paid tribute to the armed forces, whose leaders currently lead
the government.  “We expect a knee-jerk reaction to Mursi’s victory,” said
Nour Mohei-el-Din, assistant general manager for treasury at BNP
Paribas Egypt. “A positive trend in the bonds can only continue
if his promises translate into real change for the economy, jobs
are created and foreign investment comes back.”  Transitional Period  The country’s five-year credit default swaps, reflecting
the cost to insure government debt for that period, dropped 26
basis points to 697, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles data from the privately negotiated
market. They’re still among the 10 riskiest credits in the
world. The Egyptian pound, subject to a managed float, was
little changed at 6.0564 a dollar.  Before the presidential election, the ruling military
council boosted its authority while taking powers from the
president after a court ordered the dissolution of the Islamist-
dominated parliament. Decrees granted the military legislative
powers and the ability to play a direct role in shaping a new
constitution.  Mursi’s supporters, who had gathered in major squares
around the country, including Tahrir in Cairo, ahead of the
results, celebrated the victory. They also promised to continue
protests against the military’s moves to consolidate power.
Mursi is set to officially take office by July 1, the start of
the country’s fiscal year.  “We’re still in the midst of a transitional period with no
real positive effect on the economy,” Mohei-el-Din said.
“Investors, especially in the 2020 and 2040 dollar bonds, need
to see progress on the ground before they make the decision to
come back.”  The yield on Egypt’s 6.875 percent 2040 dollar notes
retreated 26 basis points, the most since May 2011, to 8.64
percent.  Shares Rally  The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  jumped the most since February
2008, climbing 7.6 percent to 4,482.48 at the close in Cairo and
trimming the drop for the quarter to 11 percent. Trading was
halted for 30 minutes after the broader EGX 100 Index rose 5
percent. Trading volume reached about 169 million shares, the
highest in more than two months and compared with a daily
average of 70 million shares in the past week.  Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) , Egypt’s biggest publicly
traded builder, soared 7.4 percent, the most since March 2011,
to 237.93 pounds.  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI) , the
biggest lender by assets, surged 9.7 percent, the biggest gain
since October 2008, to 24.43 pounds.  “The market is reacting strongly despite the fact there
are still many risks ahead,” Tamer Nigm, head of sales and
trading at Cairo-based Watheeqa Securities, said by phone.
“It’s overly optimistic as people are still in Tahrir with more
demands and nothing has changed fundamentally to resolve
political tensions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
