Japaul Oil & Maritime Services Plc (JAPAULOI) ,
a Nigerian oil-services company, gained the most this year after
rising by the daily limit.  The stock rallied a second day, advancing 5 percent to 0.63
naira at the close in Lagos, the commercial capital, the most
since Dec. 23.  “Investors believe it has bottomed out, so they expect it
to rise,” Raheem Mohammed of Kundila Finance, a Lagos-based
brokerage, said by phone today. “The company is making profit
so we expect it to climb up to about 80 kobo (0.80 naira) from
where it fell,” he said.  Japaul closed at a 52-week high of 1.18 naira on June 28,
2011 and a low of 0.53 naira on April 25, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Full-year net income for 2011 increased to 980.44 million
naira ($6 million) from 792.7 million naira, according to
figures published in an e-mailed copy of its annual report for
last year. Revenue rose to 10.25 billion naira from 7.133
billion naira, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
