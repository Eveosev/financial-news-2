A senior cleric called on  Iran ’s
Islamic establishment to counter the effects of high prices
partly caused by international sanctions,  Shargh  reported.  High prices are caused by the sanctions as well as local
businesses seeking to profit from the rising value of the dollar
by increasing their prices, and the government’s inability to
ease the pressure on poorer families through “sound management,
correct investment in production and job opportunities for
youth,” Ayatollah Nasser Makarem-Shirazi was quoted as saying
by the Tehran-based newspaper.  Makarem-Shirazi said Iran’s problems can’t be addressed by
“denial, force, pressure and presenting incorrect economic
indicators.” He said failure to tackle them may lead people to
“doubt the essence of the revolution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
