Gasoline gained, outperforming
heating oil and crude, on speculation that refinery closures in
 North America  and Europe may make summer-blend gasoline
inventories tight along the U.S. East Coast.  Futures rose after the U.K.’s Coryton refinery stopped
operating, at least the sixth plant European plant to close
since the start of 2011. Hovensa LLC’s St. Croix refinery in the
 U.S. Virgin Islands  is shut and Monroe Energy LLC isn’t expected
to open the idled Trainer,  Pennsylvania , refinery in time for
the summer driving season.  Reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, in  New York  Harbor “is
tight on the shutdown of Trainer and Hovensa,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “It’s
difficult to make up that shortfall from Europe. It’s expensive
to make and not everyone can make it.”  July-delivery gasoline rose 2.83 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$2.5982 a gallon at 9:51 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract is for reformulated blendstock, or RBOB.  Sunoco Inc. shut a vacuum tower associated with the 137
crude unit for repairs at the 355,000-barrel-a-day Philadelphia
 refinery  on June 20, a notice to city regulators shows.  The closing of Coryton and other plants in Europe has
reduced imports into New York Harbor, the delivery point for the
Nymex futures contract. U.S. East Coast gasoline imports have
averaged 612,000 barrels a day so far this year, down from
789,000 barrels a day during the same period in 2011.  Tropical Storm  Heating oil followed crude lower as Tropical Storm Debby
held steady in the  Gulf of Mexico  off the  Florida Panhandle 
without posing a threat to oil operations on the Gulf Coast.  “Oil is down because Tropical Storm Debby is going to
steer clear of offshore and refining operations on the Gulf
Coast and because there’s more discouraging news out of
Europe,” Lipow said.  Heating oil for July delivery fell 1.91 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.5146 a gallon on the exchange. Prices touched
$2.51, the lowest intraday level for the front-month contract
since Jan. 10, 2011. Crude oil for August delivery on the Nymex
lost $1.40 to $78.36.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.9
cent to $3.411 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest price since Jan. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
