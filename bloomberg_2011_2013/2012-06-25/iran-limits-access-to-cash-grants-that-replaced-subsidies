Iran  has restricted the availability
of monthly cash handouts that were intended to offset price
increases after a reduction in food and energy subsidies, the
 Iranian Students News Agency  reported.  About 70 million people are now receiving the payments,
said Mohammad-Reza Farzin, the head of subsidy reform, according
to the state-run news agency. Officials said last year that
about 72.5 million out of a population of 75 million were
getting them. Some of the reduction comes from the exclusion of
Iranians living abroad, Farzin said.  Iran began to cut subsidies in December 2010 under a five-
year plan that won praise from the  International Monetary Fund .
Its implementation led to inflationary pressures that have
intensified this year with the tightening of international
economic sanctions imposed to halt  Iranâ€™s nuclear program .  The cash payments were increased to 485,000 rials ($39)
from 455,000 rials earlier this month to make up for higher
bread prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
