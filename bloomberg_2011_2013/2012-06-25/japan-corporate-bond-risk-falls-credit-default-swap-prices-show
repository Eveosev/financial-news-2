The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  from default dropped, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan  index  fell 1 basis point to 182
basis points as of 9:15 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The benchmark is set for its lowest close since June 20,
after declining 4 basis points year to date, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia  index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 180.5 basis points
as of 8:18 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices. The measure has declined 26.3 basis
points this year, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx  Australia   index  was little changed at
186.5 basis points as of 11:06 a.m. in Sydney,  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  prices show. The gauge increased 4.9
basis points this year, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
