NCI Building Systems Inc. (NCS) ’s $250
million term loan to finance its acquisition of Metl-Span LLC
rose in initial trading, according to Markit Group Ltd.  The debt due in May 2018 first changed hands at 96.5 cents
on the dollar, Markit prices show. That’s up from an issue price
of 95 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Royal Bank of Canada, UBS AG and
Citigroup Inc. arranged the financing for the Houston-based
manufacturer of metal-building products, the data show.  The loan pays interest at 6.75 percentage points more than
the London interbank offered rate, with a 1.25 percent floor on
the benchmark, Bloomberg data show. Libor, the rate at which
banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other, serves as
a reference for about $360 trillion of financial instruments.  NCI completed its acquisition of the manufacturer of
insulated building panel products for $145 million, according to
a June 22 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
