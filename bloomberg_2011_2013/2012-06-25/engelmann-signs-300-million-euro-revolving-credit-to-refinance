Tengelmann Warenhandelsgesellschaft
KG, a family-run German retailer, signed a 300 million-euro
($375 million) revolving credit facility with nine banks to
refinance an existing credit line.  The five-year loan was signed on June 15 and replaces a 440
million-euro revolving credit taken in 2006, lenders said in an
e-mailed statement.  Bayerische Landesbank , Commerzbank AG, Landesbank Hessen-
Thueringen Girozentrale and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  arranged the deal as
bookrunners, with five more banks joining in syndication,
according to the statement. The size of each institutionâ€™s
commitment was reduced after the lenders oversubscribed the
deal, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
