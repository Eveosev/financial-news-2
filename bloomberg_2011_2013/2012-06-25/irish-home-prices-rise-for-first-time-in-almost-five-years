Irish  home prices  rose for the first
time in almost five years in May, suggesting that the worst of
the slump in the nation’s real estate market may be at an end.  Residential property prices nationally increased an average
0.2 percent in May from the previous month, the first increase
since September 2007, the  Central Statistics Office  in Cork said
on its website today. Dublin prices rose 0.2 percent, the third
consecutive monthly increase.  “We don’t see a major improvement in the housing market
until there is clear evidence that the jobless rate has peaked
and is on  a downward trend,” said  Alan McQuaid , an economist
at Merrion Capital in Dublin. “That said, the May house price
data are a step in the right direction and suggest the worst may
be over.”  Ireland’s decade-long real-estate bubble burst in 2008,
leading to a 67.5 billion-euro ($84.2 billion) international
rescue and the nationalization of five of the country’s biggest
lenders. Residential property prices are down 15.3 percent from
a year earlier, while Dublin prices have dropped 17.5 percent in
the same period.  “We’re unlikely to see any significant increase in  house
prices  in the coming months,” said Ronan Lyons, an economist at
Daft.ie, the country’s largest online residential property site.
“The Dublin market may continue to bounce along the bottom, but
I’d expect further declines for the rest of the country.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
