A San Marino bank can’t appeal the
2011 U.K. ruling that  Barclays Plc (BARC)  didn’t mislead Cassa di
Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino SpA when it sold it
collateralized debt obligations in 2000.  A judge in the 2011 case dismissed the claim brought by the
bank, which alleged the way the British lender rated the notes
at the heart of a 92 million-euro ($115 million) lawsuit was “a
scam.”  Barclays and lenders in the region have clashed before over
CDO transactions. The London-based bank and Banca Popolare di
Intra Scrl settled a claim in 2010 over derivatives Barclays
sold the Italian regional lender in 2000. Barclays had been
accused of selling a CDO that was likely to default. Neither
party admitted liability in their settlement.  Barclays had denied the allegations it sold the San Marino
bank structured notes that misrepresented the risks.  Dario Loiacono , a lawyer for the San Marino bank, declined
to comment on the ruling. A call and e-mail to Barclays didn’t
receive an immediate response.  The case is: Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San
Marino SpA v. Barclays Bank Plc, Case No: 08-757,  High Court  of
Justice, Queen’s  Bench Division .  To contact the reporter on this story:
