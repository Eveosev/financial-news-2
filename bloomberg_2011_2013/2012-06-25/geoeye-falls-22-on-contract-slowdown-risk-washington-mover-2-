GeoEye Inc. (GEOY)  fell the most in seven
years after the provider of satellite imagery said a federal
agency may scale back a $3.8 billion contract.  Shares of the Herndon, Virginia-based company fell $4.10,
or 22 percent, to close at $14.24, in  New York  trading. It was
the biggest decline since Aug. 19, 2004.  The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency awarded GeoEye
the multiyear contract in 2010. The agency proposed exercising a
three-month option valued at $39.8 million through November,
with the remaining $119 million through August 2013 dependent on
agency funding, according to a June 22 company filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The announcement is a “significant negative for GeoEye,
but is not as bad as it could be,” Brian Ruttenbur, an analyst
with CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , wrote today
in a note to clients.  While the contract changes increase “the risk to core
imagery revenues over the next year,” the company may still
make previous projections depending on how much funding it gets
later, Ruttenbur said. He has a fairly valued rating on the
company.  GeoEye also sells companies such as Google Inc. satellite
imagery for online applications.  GeoEye expects its contract for the EnhancedView satellite
program won’t be “significantly affected” because the company
has received “positive signals” that Congress will restore
funding, Chief Executive Officer Matthew O’Connell said today in
a conference call with investors.  ‘Funding Shortfalls’  DigitalGlobe Inc. (DGI) , based in Longmont,  Colorado , has a $3.55
billion contract under the same program. The public-private
partnership was designed to support government satellites.  The two companies together committed more than $1 billion
of private investment to the program based on their 10-year
government agreements with the agency.  EnhancedView, which began in September 2010, includes one-
year base agreements with nine annual options for renewal,
according to Ken White, a spokesman for the National Geospatial-
Intelligence Agency.  “We do not openly discuss budget figures, and due to
funding shortfalls do not plan to exercise GeoEye’s next option
year as contracted,” White said in an e-mail.  While GeoEye’s full-year funding under the program may
total $159 million, “there can be no assurances” the agency
will exercise both options as proposed, according to the
company’s SEC filing.  GeoEye Satellite  The agency plans to cancel additional funding for the
development and launch of the GeoEye-2 satellite, planned for
the first half of 2013, according to the filing. The satellite
is part of the contract.  The company still expects to receive $181 million in
government funding for the satellite, including $111 million in
“the next 30 days,” O’Connell said.  “You don’t pay $181 million for something you don’t intend
to use,” he said on the conference call.  GeoEye doesn’t plan to delay the satellite launch and has
the ability to offset a drop in revenue by selling capacity to
other customers, O’Connell said.  A Senate panel last month recommended restoring about $125
million to the program, which was reduced under President  Barack
Obama ’s budget request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.  ‘Creative Solution’  Lawmakers on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee last
year asked the Obama administration to avoid cutting the
commercial satellite program, valued at more than $7 billion.  “In this period of extreme fiscal restraint, this
partnership represents a creative solution that should be
applauded and emulated,” a dozen House and Senate lawmakers
wrote in a Nov. 22 letter to Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  and
National Intelligence Director  James Clapper . “We support the
EnhancedView program and urge the department and the
intelligence community to sustain it.”  Benchmark Co. analyst Josephine Millward downgraded her
rating on the company to hold from buy.  GeoEye offered to buy DigitalGlobe on May 4, saying it
would create the world’s largest commercial-imagery satellite
company and help cope with planned U.S. defense cuts.
DigitalGlobe rejected the offer two days later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
