European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said the ECB would rather have the
European Financial Stability Facility buy  government bonds  than
itself, according to an interview in  Austria ’s Kurier newspaper.  “The EFSF has the option to buy government bonds in the
secondary market,” Nowotny was quoted as saying by the Vienna-
based  newspaper . “The ECB has welcomed this opportunity because
it doesn’t want to go on with its own program to buy government
bonds.”  Nowotny said he expects the European Union’s summit this
week to define the general direction of policy measures to fight
the euro area’s debt crisis. Those measures need to be worked
out in more detail after the summit, he said.  “We have to be careful not to create great, unrealistic
expectations which mean that disappointment is a foregone
conclusion,” he said. “The proposals include a political
union, a fiscal union and a banking union. All three proposals
are very far-reaching.”  Nowotny said that a prolongation of the Greek aid program
can only be considered after “taking stock” with the new
government in  Athens .  To contact the reporter on this story:
