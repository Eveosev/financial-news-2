Nigeria’s five-year borrowing costs
are poised to hit a record high at a debt auction tomorrow on
concern inflation is climbing to the fastest in more than two
years.  The Debt Management Office will offer as much as 83.9
billion naira ($515 million) in debt, including up to 30 billion
naira of 15.1 percent bonds due 2017, according to a  statement 
on its website. Yields on the existing 2017 notes rose seven
basis points to a record high of 15.71 percent on June 25,
according to prices on the  Financial Markets Dealers Association 
website.  While  inflation  slowed to 12.7 percent in May from 12.9
percent in April, the rate is set to peak at 14.5 percent in the
third quarter, the highest since April 2010, according to the
 Central Bank of Nigeria . Policy makers led by Governor Lamido Sanusi have held the  benchmark interest rate  at 12 percent this
year to curb the naira’s decline and combat inflation, after
raising it by 5.75 percentage points in 2011.  “Inflation risk remains the blemish,”  Dumisani Ngwenya , a
Johannesburg-based  Africa  strategist at Barclays Plc’s Absa
Capital, said in e-mailed comments yesterday. The dip in price
growth in May is probably temporary, said Ngwenya.  Higher gasoline prices are spurring inflation after the
government partially removed fuel subsidies in January.  Gas
prices  increased to 97 naira a liter (0.26 gallon) in January
from 65 naira.  ‘Sustained Pressure’  The naira, which was Africa’s best-performing currency
against the dollar in the first five months of this year, is now
down 0.2 percent this year, trading at 162.65 per dollar as of
3:21 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital.  While domestic gasoline prices increased on the subsidy
change, Africa’s largest oil producer is earning less from its
crude exports because of the worldwide price plunge. Bonny Light
crude,  Nigeria ’s benchmark blend, has dropped 28 percent from a
March 13 peak of $128.47 per barrel.  Oil accounted for 83 percent of Nigeria’s total exports in
the fourth quarter, according to the statistics office. The
country of 160 million people depends on crude exports for more
than 80 percent of government revenue and 95 percent of foreign-
currency income.  “The key factor driving the yields up is the sustained
pressure on the local currency as a result of foreign investors’
profit-taking and moving their funds out of the market,” said
Tola Odukoya, an analyst at Dunn Loren Merrifield Ltd. in Lagos.
“We expect the yields of all the bonds to come out higher than
that of the previous auction.”  The West African nation’s foreign reserves have fallen $612
million this month to $37.1 billion as of June 22 as the central
bank has increased dollar sales at twice-weekly  currency
auctions  and directly to the market to defend the naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
