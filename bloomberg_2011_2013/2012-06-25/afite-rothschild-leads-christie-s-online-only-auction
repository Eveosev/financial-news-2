In the dog days of August, when most
auction activity ceases, Christie’s will hold its first
exclusively online sale.  The “Signature Cellars” auction will offer 301 wine lots,
including a case of 1982 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild estimated at
$35,000 to $45,000.  “Taking the experience of auction online has become an
imperative,” said Steven Murphy, Christie’s chief executive
officer, in a telephone interview. “Our clients in all age
categories, all wealth categories and all interest categories
are communicating with us online on a daily basis.”  Last year, 29 percent of the bids Christie’s received
globally came through its online platform, “ Christie’s LIVE .”
About half of those bids were by new clients. The online sales
generated $130 million in 2011, a 46 percent increase in that
revenue stream since 2008, the first full year Christie’s
tracked its online auction revenue.  Wine was the most popular category with online bidders,
with 21 percent of Christie’s global wine sales last year.
Watches were a close second.  The “Signature Cellars” auction will start on Aug. 6 and
end on Aug. 20. The offerings will be “very much on par with
what we’ve sold in a real auction setting,” said Scott
Torrence, Christie’s senior lead wine specialist for the
Americas.  Sourced from three private collections, the wine has a
combined sales target of $750,000 to $1 million.  It’s not the type of material typically found at Internet
auctions. Wine auctioneers tend to keep the most desirable
material for their live events.  Not Pinnacle  “The online-only sales tend to be not as premier,” said
Tim Clew, co-managing partner of the Wine Trust, a wine-
investment fund. “They tend to have broken-up cases of the
pinnacle stuff and full cases of stuff that may be not top-
tier.”  In addition to the 1982 Lafite, Christie’s will offer 2000
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild in an original wooden case, estimated
to bring $20,000 to $30,000. A mid-range 2000 Chateau Cheval-
Blanc, also in original wooden case, is estimated at $7,000 to
$10,000.  The auction house plans to create online-only sales in
other luxury collectible categories, including watches, prints
and fine art. There will also be auctions from single-owner
collections.  “We are not recreating the wheel here,” Torrence said.
“The thing we can bring is a sense of better quality.”  Comics, Coins  Christie’s main rival,  Sotheby’s (BID) , doesn’t offer online-only
sales. Dallas-based  Heritage Auctions  has them weekly in
categories such as comics, coins, currency, guitars, watches and
jewelry. They generated between $35 million and $40 million in
2011, according to Heritage co-founder Jim Halperin. Online lots
start at $1 and usually don’t exceed $4,000; the average lot
falls between $200 and $400.  “Most of the better things we sell at live auctions,”
Halperin said.  In December, Christie’s held an online-only sale that ran
as a companion to its live auctions of  Elizabeth Taylor ’s
jewels, gowns and art. The Internet part tallied $9.5 million,
with all of 973 lots finding buyers.  Muse highlights include  John Mariani  on wine and  Hephzibah
Anderson  on books.  To contact the reporter on this story:
