South  Korea ’s won dropped to a one-
week low and  government bonds  fell as Europe’s credit crisis
sapped demand for emerging-market assets.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of shares retreated for a third day as
exchange data showed overseas funds sold more of the nation’s
shares than they bought today. The euro approached the lowest
level in more than a week as European Union leaders hold a two-
day summit in Belgium starting on June 28. Billionaire investor
 George Soros  said in an interview with Bloomberg Television
yesterday that the summit could turn out to be a “fiasco” if
the European leaders fail to resolve disagreement on the fiscal
side within the next few days.  “With so many issues to be solved, there is both
expectation and doubt about the European summit in the market,”
said Lee Jung Hyun, a Seoul-based currency dealer with the
Industrial Bank of Korea. “With the Kospi falling, a lot of
overseas investors and local bank traders were betting for a
stronger dollar today.”  The won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,161.63 per dollar at the
close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 1,162.15 earlier, the weakest since June 15.  The won’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 8.36 percent.  South Korea’s  industrial output  expanded 0.5 percent in May
from April, when it increased 0.9 percent, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before
government data due on June 29.  The yield on the 3.5 percent bonds due March 2017 rose one
basis point to 3.42 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
Three-year debt futures climbed 0.03 to 104.77 and one-year
 interest-rate swaps  were little changed at 3.34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
