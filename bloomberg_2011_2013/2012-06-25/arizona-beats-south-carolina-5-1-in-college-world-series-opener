The University of  Arizona  is one win
from a first national baseball championship in 26 years after
beating the University of  South Carolina  5-1 in the College
World Series finals opener.  Arizona’s Robert Refsnyder hit a two-run home run in the
bottom of the first inning yesterday in Omaha,  Nebraska , while
Wildcats starting pitcher Konner Wade tossed a complete game,
limiting the two-time defending national champions to one run on
six hits over nine innings.  Arizona (47-17) can win its first National Collegiate
Athletic Association baseball title since  1986  with a victory
tonight. If South Carolina wins, a decisive third game would be
played tomorrow in Omaha.  Refsnyder, Arizona’s cleanup hitter, struck his eighth
homer of the season in the bottom of the first inning against
Gamecocks starting pitcher Forrest Koumas. Alex Mejia and Seth
Mejias-Brean added run-scoring singles in the third and fifth
innings to push the Wildcats’ lead to 4-0.  South Carolina’s lone run came in the sixth inning on a
two-out run-scoring single by Evan Marzilli, while Bobby Brown’s
single drove in the fifth Arizona run in the bottom of the
seventh inning at TD Ameritrade Park.  Wade issued only one walk and had three strikeouts in
becoming the first pitcher with two complete games at the
College World Series since Jason Windsor of Cal-State Fullerton
in 2004. In his previous start, on June 17 against UCLA, Wade
threw a five-hit shutout as Arizona won 4-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
