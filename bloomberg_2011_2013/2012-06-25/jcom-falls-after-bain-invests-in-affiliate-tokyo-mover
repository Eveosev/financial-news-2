Jupiter Telecommunications Co. fell
the most in more than two years after Bain Capital LLC offered
to buy 50 percent of TV shopping affiliate Jupiter Shop Channel
Co.  Jupiter Telecommunications, also known as JCom, declined as
much as 9.3 percent to 79,900 yen. The stock fell 7.3 percent to
81,700 yen as of 10:44 a.m. on the Jasdaq exchange, compared
with a 0.1 percent drop in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Bain, the Boston-based private-equity firm co-founded by
 Mitt Romney , will acquire 50 percent of Jupiter Shop Channel,
the stake’s owner,  Sumitomo Corp. (8053) , said on June 22. The deal is
valued at more than $1 billion, according to a person familiar
with the transaction, who asked not to be identified because the
terms weren’t disclosed.  Sumitomo controls almost 40 percent of JCom, while Jupiter
Shop Channel is closely held, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
