The Philippine peso fell for a third
day, the longest losing streak in a month, as concern Europe’s
debt crisis is worsening sapped demand for emerging-market
assets.  Net foreign-direct investment into the  Philippines  will
probably be $1.2 billion this year, lower than a previous
estimate of $2 billion, central bank Deputy Governor Diwa
Guinigundo said June 22. Italy is scheduled to sell inflation-
linked securities maturing in 2016 and 2026 tomorrow as well as
3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) of zero-coupon bonds.  Spain  will
offer three- and six-month bills the same day. European Union
leaders will hold a two-day summit starting on June 28.  “Asian currencies are heading southward against the
dollar,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a Singapore-based senior
currency analyst at Malayan Banking Bhd. “The Italy and Spain
auctions would be the key thing and the European leaders’
meeting” for  emerging markets , he said.  The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 42.645 per dollar in
Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency touched
42.675, the lowest level since June 13. Its one-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 5.95 percent.  The peso has strengthened 0.6 percent this quarter, the
best performance among Asia’s 10 most-used currencies excluding
the yen.  The yield on the government’s 5.875 percent bonds due March
2032 slipped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.94
percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.  Budget Undersecretary Laura Pascua said in a mobile-phone
text that  government spending  increased 16.7 percent in May from
a year earlier, helping bolster growth this quarter.  To contact the reporter for this story:
