Greece ’s catering and tourist
industry employees called a 24-hour strike for June 27 to
protest measures, including wage cuts, demanded in exchange for
a second international bailout for the country.  “Employees are blatantly using the avalanche of measures,
which are crushing the human and social rights of workers, to
violently demand submission to their demands,” the  Panhellenic
Federation of Catering and Tourist Industry Employees  said in  a
statement  on its website today.  The strike comes in one of the key months for tourism,
Greece’s biggest industry. Tourism accounted for almost 16
percent of gross domestic product and almost one in five jobs in
Greece in 2011, according to the London-based  World Travel and
Tourism Council .  Greece’s coalition government has pledged to renegotiate
some austerity measures demanded by the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  in exchange for a 130 billion-euro
($162 billion) second bailout. The coalition partners agreed
that a law on a 22 percent minimum-wage cut should be repealed
and that value added taxes for businesses including cafes, bars
and restaurants should be reduced.  “Every euro they take away from workers doesn’t only
affect them and their families but also brings closer the
collapse of pension funds, the economy and society,” the
association said. The “third-world salaries and galley
conditions” include 12-hour work days six to seven days a week
with salaries of as low as 511 euros a month, the group added.  The federation also plans a 48-hour strike starting July
11, Athens News Agency reported, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
