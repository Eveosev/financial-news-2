Armenia will lose if hostilities
resume with neighboring  Azerbaijan  over the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, Azeri Presideint Illham Aliyev said.  “I have no doubt that Armenia will flee the battlefield if
the active phase of the war starts,” Aliyev said in remarks
broadcast on the state television channel AzTV today. “We have
every opportunity to regain control of our territory.”  Armenians seized Nagorno-Karabakh and seven adjacent
districts from Azerbaijan in a war that killed some 30,000
people and displaced more than a million. Large-scale
hostilities ended with a Russia-brokered cease-fire in 1994,
though the sides have yet to sign a peace agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
