Iran ’s oil minister, Rostam Qasemi,
said China National Petroleum Corp. must start developing phase
11 of the South Pars  gas field  by the end of the Iranian year on
March 20, 2013, the  Tehran Times  reported.  An agreement was signed more than two years ago and Iran is
“dissatisfied” with the Chinese company’s “frequent
delaying,” the newspaper cited Mousa Souri, the managing
director of Pars Oil and Gas Co., as saying last October.  The National Iranian Oil Co. signed a $5 billion contract
with CNPC three years ago to develop phase 11 of the gas field,
which Iran shares with Qatar. The Chinese company replaced
French oil producer Total SA. Iran, which is under international
financial and energy sanctions over its nuclear program, said it
chose another partner because Total was delaying the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
