Liechtenstein banks should focus on
asset management and attracting inflows from wealthy Asian
clients to rebuild their business, according to the head of the
Alpine country’s financial regulator.  “To get earnings back to where they used to be we need to
implement new business ideas,” Financial Market Authority Chief
Executive Officer Mario Gassner said, citing asset management,
alternative investment funds and Asian customers. “With classic
private banking it will be difficult to attract net new money.”  Liechtenstein’s wealth management assets have dropped
almost a fifth to 166 billion Swiss francs ($173 billion) since
 Germany  used data stolen from the principality biggest bank, LGT
Group, in 2008 to prosecute tax evaders. The country of 36,000
people agreed in March 2009 to meet international standards to
avoid being blacklisted as a tax haven by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.  The principality’s tax authority last month wrote to
customers of  Liechtensteinische Landesbank AG (LLB)  that the U.S. had
sent an information request covering accounts that contained at
least $500,000 at any time since the beginning of 2004.
Liechtenstein’s second-biggest bank, also known as LLB, is one
of 11 financial firms, including  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , being
investigated as part of a U.S. probe of offshore  tax evasion .  “With the OECD’s new tax standards there will be more
information requests,” said Gassner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
