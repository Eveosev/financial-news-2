The lira weakened for a third day to
the lowest level in 11 days after a Turkish warplane was shot
down by Syrian forces.  The lira slumped 0.4 percent to 1.8214 per dollar at 9:12
a.m. in Istanbul, paring this year’s gains versus the dollar to
3.8 percent.  The downing of the plane has heightened tensions that have
arisen in the past year between Ankara and Damascus over Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad’s crackdown on anti-government
protesters, which has left more than 10,000 people dead.  Turkey 
is still weighing a response to the attack which occurred in
international airspace, Turkish Foreign Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu 
said on state television yesterday.  Syria  has criticized Turkey
for hosting meetings of Syrian opposition groups, while Turkey
has called for a change of regime in its southern neighbour.  “This is a major development and we will see selling until
it becomes clear how this will be resolved and the uncertainty
is ended,” Onur Bayol, a currency and fixed-income trader at
Denizbank AS in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
