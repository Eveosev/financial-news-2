Egyptian shares rallied the most in
more than four months after the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed
Mursi was declared the country’s first freely elected president.  The benchmark EGX 30 Index climbed 3.9 percent, the biggest
intraday advance since Feb. 13, to 4,330.49 at 10:38 a.m. in
Cairo. Commercial International Bank SAE, the country’s biggest
publicly traded lender, gained 6.3 percent, poised for the
biggest daily increase since January, to 23.68 Egyptian pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
