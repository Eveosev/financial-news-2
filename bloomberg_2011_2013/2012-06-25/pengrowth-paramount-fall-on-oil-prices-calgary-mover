Pengrowth Energy Corp. (PGF) , which has
lost more than 40 percent of its value this year, and  Paramount
Resources Ltd. (POU)  fell along with other Canadian oil producers as
crude dropped below $80 a barrel for a third day on concerns a
sluggish global economy will cut fossil-fuel demand.  Pengrowth, based in Calgary, fell 5.3 percent to C$6.20 at
the close in Toronto, the lowest since Mar. 11, 2009. Paramount
declined 6.5 percent to C$22.30, the lowest since Nov. 17, 2010.  “If you believe that the world economy is shrinking, which
most people probably believe, then it’s not a stretch to imagine
that the rate of growth and oil demand is decreasing,” Eric Nuttall who manages C$90 million for the energy fund at  Sprott
Inc. (SII)  in Toronto, said in an interview today. “Supply this year
is likely surpassing demand.”  Oil for August delivery declined 0.7 percent to settle at
$79.21 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after  George
Soros  warned that a failure by European Union leaders to stem
the region’s debt crisis may spell the demise of the euro.
Futures are down 20 percent this year.  Ithaca Energy Inc. (IAE)  fell 15 percent to C$1.56 and  Blackpearl
Resources Inc. (PXX)  dropped 8.9 percent to C$2.87, the lowest since
July 6, 2010.  Baytex Energy Corp. (BTE)  slipped 2 percent to C$39.69,
the lowest since Nov. 5, 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
