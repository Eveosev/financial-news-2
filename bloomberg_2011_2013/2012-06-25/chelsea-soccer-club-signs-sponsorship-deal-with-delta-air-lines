Premier League soccer club Chelsea
signed a two-year sponsorship agreement with  Delta Air Lines
Inc. (DAL) , which will become its official global airline partner.  “Partnering with a leading club in the Premier League is
an exciting way to strengthen our brand both in the U.K. and
around the world,” Perry Cantarutti, Delta’s senior vice-
president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a
 statement  on Chelsea’s website.  Chelsea’s Chief Executive Officer Ron Gourlay said the deal
with Delta, the world’s second-biggest airline, “demonstrates
our commitment to growing our activities” in the U.S.  Chelsea, owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, won
the Champions League last season and finished sixth in the
Premier League.  The London-based club, whose main jersey sponsor is Samsung
Electronics Co., last month signed a three-year deal to make
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi its official car partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
