A Ukrainian court ordered a medical
examination of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko before
hearing charges of  tax evasion  and embezzlement against her.  The court, based in the eastern city of Kharkiv, where
Tymoshenko is serving a seven-year sentence, postponed a hearing
scheduled for today until July 10 after prosecutors questioned
the former prime minister’s ability to attend.  She has been in a hospital since May 9 because of back
pain, according to a statement on her  website .  Tymoshenko was found guilty in October of overstepping her
authority as premier when signing a 2009 natural-gas pact with
 Russia . She says the case was engineered by President  Viktor Yanukovych  to silence opposition before parliamentary elections
in October. The European Union, the U.S, and Russia have
condemned her conviction.  Prosecutors also accuse Tymoshenko of tax evasion while
serving as chief executive officer of gas trader United Energy
Systems in the 1990s, while Yanukovych has said she may have
been involved in the murder of a lawmaker 16 years ago. She
denies all charges.  Officials including European Commission President  Jose
Manuel Barroso  are boycotting matches in this month’s European
soccer championships in Ukraine in protest at Tymoshenko’s
imprisonment. The final of the tournament, which Ukraine is co-
hosting with Poland, will take place July 1 in Kiev.  To contact the reporter on this story:
