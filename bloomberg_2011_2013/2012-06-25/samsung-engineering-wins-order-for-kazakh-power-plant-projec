Samsung Engineering Co. received an
engineering, procurement and supervision deal in  Kazakhstan  for
a 1,320-megawatt coal power plant to be built near Almaty.  Construction in Balkhash, near the financial capital, must
be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017, state-owned AO
Samruk Energo said today in an e-mailed statement.  A venture between  Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) ,  Korea Electric Power
Corp. (KEP)  and Kazakhstan may begin developing the $2.2 billion plant
as early as 2013, Bakhytzhan Dzhaksaliyev, a deputy industry and
technology minister, said in November. The plant is part of the
venture’s $4.5 billion plan for power projects in the country.  The state National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna’s energy
unit sold 75 percent minus one share of the AO Balkhashskaya TES
plant to Samsung C&T Corp. for 7.6 billion tenge ($51 million)
in April, according to the Kazakh company’s website. Samruk
Energo kept 25 percent plus one share of the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
