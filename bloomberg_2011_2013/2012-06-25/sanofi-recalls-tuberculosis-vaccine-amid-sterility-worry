Sanofi (SAN)  voluntarily recalled four
batches of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin tuberculosis vaccine because
the product’s sterility can’t be assured,  Australia ’s drugs
regulator said.  The supply interruption may cause a shortage of the vaccine
in Australia while alternatives are sought, the Therapeutic
Goods Administration in Canberra said in a June 20  statement  on
its website. The recall was classified “class II,” meaning the
defects may cause illness or mistreatment.  The vaccine is also being voluntarily recalled in  Canada 
and  New Zealand , while manufacturing at a plant in Toronto is
being suspended for renovation and to improve environmental
quality management within the building, said Patricia Waghorn,
Sanofi’s head of communications for Australia and New Zealand.  “Our monitoring found that the level of sterility was not
at an acceptable level,” Waghorn said in an e-mail today.
“There is currently no stock available in Australia and a
return to supply is not expected in the short term.”  Isolated from a cow with tuberculosis by scientists at the
Pasteur Institute in Paris, BCG was first used in 1921 and is
the  only vaccine  available to protect against tuberculosis. It
is most effective in protecting children from the disease, the
 World Health Organization  said on its website.  The vaccine, which contains live, weakened bacteria, isn’t
part of Australia’s  routine vaccination schedule , and is
typically given to newborns living in areas of higher TB
incidence, children under 5 years living in high-prevalence
countries for more than three months, and people handling dead
bodies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
