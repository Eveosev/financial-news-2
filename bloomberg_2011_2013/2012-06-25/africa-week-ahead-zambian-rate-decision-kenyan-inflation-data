Zambia’s central bank announces its
latest interest rate decision on June 29, after leaving the
measure unchanged at 9 percent for a second consecutive meeting
last month to curb inflation.  Consumer-price growth in  Africa ’s biggest copper-producing
nation accelerated to 6.6 percent last month from 6.5 percent in
April.  Kenya’s statistics office is scheduled to announce June
inflation data from June 28 onward. Prices  climbed  12.2 percent
in May from a year earlier, compared with a rate of 13.1 percent
in the previous month, the Nairobi-based agency said May 30.
