Former International Monetary Fund
chief economist  Simon Johnson  met with Federal Reserve staff
members today and said he doesn’t believe the central bank will
heed his call to remove  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  from the New York Fed board of directors.  “I have not felt optimistic about either Jamie Dimon
resigning or” about the Fed revising its policies for its
boards of directors, Johnson, a professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said today in a call with reporters.
The meeting had “nothing that changed my lack of optimism.”  Johnson met with the Fed’s general counsel, Scott Alvarez,
and Board Secretary Jennifer Johnson today after circulating a
petition on the website change.org calling for  Dimon’s removal 
from the  New York  Fed’s board. The petition has gained more than
37,000 online supporters, he said.  The directors at the 12 regional Fed banks are under
scrutiny following a $2 billion trading loss at JPMorgan that
revived concern that its regulator, the New York Fed, is too
cozy with Wall Street. Dimon is one of three bankers sitting on
the board of the New York Fed.  “It is entirely unacceptable to have Mr. Dimon involved in
the governance of the New York Fed, an organization that
oversees his activities, decisions, and potential losses,”
according to Johnson’s petition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
