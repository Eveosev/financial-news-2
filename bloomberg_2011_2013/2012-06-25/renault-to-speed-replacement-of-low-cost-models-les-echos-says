Renault SA (RNO)  plans to accelerate
replacement of low-cost models, which represent a third of all
sales and three-quarters of growth prospects,  Les Echos 
reported, without citing anyone.  The carmaker will introduce successors to three of its most
popular low-cost models in 2013, the French newspaper said,
naming the Sandero, the Logan and the Logan station wagon.
Renault also plans to lower development costs by 40 percent
compared with spending on its first Logan in 2004 when it
introduced low-cost cars, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
