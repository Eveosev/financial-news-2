Temperatures of more than 100
degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) may spread across the Midwest,
including Chicago, this week before the heat drifts into the
mid-Atlantic states.  Chicago may have a high of 101 degrees by June 28 and  St.
Louis  may reach 104 the next day, according to the  National
Weather Service . While Tropical Storm Debby gave oil and gas
producers a scare over the weekend, forcing evacuations of off-
shore rigs in the  Gulf of Mexico , the heat drifting east may
provide the bigger boost to energy markets.  “The big story this week is not Debby, but rather a strong
heat surge in the middle of the nation that travels eastward
over the next several days,”  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC, wrote in a note to clients today
from Bethesda, Maryland.  A heat wave throughout the Northeast and into eastern
Canada last week pushed up day-ahead electricity prices across
the region. On June 21, day-ahead prices reached a three-year
high in  New York  as temperatures rose into the 90s in the city.  Temperatures from Utah to Delaware may be 5 to 7 degrees
above normal from June 30 to July 4, according to  MDA EarthSat
Weather  in Gaithersburg, Maryland. New York and New Jersey may
have temperatures 3 to 4 degrees higher during the same time
period, the commercial forecaster said.  The high temperature in New York may reach 88 on June 29
and Washington may be 10 degrees higher, according to the
Weather Service.  For July 1, the normal average temperature in  New York City 
is 76, according to MDA. It’s 72 in  Boston ; 79 in Washington; 80
in Atlanta; 74 in Chicago; 84 in Houston; 64 in Seattle and 73
in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
