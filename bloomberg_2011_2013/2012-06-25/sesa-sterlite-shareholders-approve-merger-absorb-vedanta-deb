Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA)  and  Sterlite
Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT)  shareholders approved a plan to combine
the units of  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  into a new company.  The proposal won the required majority at the voting held
on June 19 and June 21, Sesa Goa and Sterlite said today in
separate statements. Sesa is India’s largest iron ore exporter,
while Sterlite is the nation’s largest copper producer.  Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources said on Feb.
25 it will combine the listed units to reduce its debt following
its $8.67 billion purchase of oil producer  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) 
Investors will get three Sesa shares for five of Sterlite and
Vedanta will transfer for $1 to the new company its holding in
Cairn  India , including a $5.9 billion debt.  Shares of Panaji, Goa-based Sesa rose 0.3 percent to 187.35
rupees at the close in Mumbai. Sterlite gained 0.5 percent to
99.15 rupees. The benchmark Sensitive Index fell 0.5 percent.  Vedanta plans to complete the merger by end of this year,
it said today in a statement.  Vedanta, with no previous experience in oil and gas
projects, is trying to boost its finances and ratings after
buying Cairn India and gaining access to the nation’s biggest
onshore oilfield. Unprofitable Vedanta Aluminium Ltd., owned
70.5 percent by Vedanta, will be consolidated into the new
company, according to the Feb. 25 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
