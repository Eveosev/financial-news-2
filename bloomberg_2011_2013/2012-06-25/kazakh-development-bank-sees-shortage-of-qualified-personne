Kazakhstan  has a “considerable
shortage of adequately qualified personnel” in its financial
sector, according to the central Asian country’s  development
bank .  The shortfall is particularly evident in such areas as risk
management and brokerage services, the Development Bank of
Kazakhstan said in a prospectus published on the Kazakhstan
Stock Exchange  website  today.  “If the shortage of adequately qualified personnel
persists,” the Development Bank of Kazakhstan’s “ability to
offer the desired range and volume of services and monitor and
maintain the quality of its assets may be affected, which may,
in turn, affect” its “business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects,” the lender said.  “In addition, a shortage of adequately qualified personnel
may force” the bank “to offer additional financial and other
incentives to retain existing personnel and recruit additional
personnel, which would increase operating expenses,” according
to the statement.  Kazakhstan, central  Asia ’s biggest energy producer, tapped
its oil fund for $10 billion to support banks and companies
after credit markets froze and a property bubble burst in 2008.
BTA Bank, the biggest lender at the time, Alliance Bank and
Temirbank agreed with creditors to discount and extend payments
on about $20 billion of debt after they defaulted the following
year.  The Development Bank of Kazakhstan picked the Malaysian
units of  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and
JSC Halyk Finance to sell as much as 1.5 billion Malaysian
ringgit ($469 million) Islamic bonds in the Southeast Asian
nation.  The state-owned lender didn’t immediately reply to an e-
mailed request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
