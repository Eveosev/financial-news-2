Ukraine’s grain harvest will fall to
between 43 million and 44 million metric tons this year,
according to Tetiana Adamenko, the head of the agro-meteorology
department at the national weather center.  That compares with 56.7 million tons in 2011, according to
the state statistics office data. Ukraine’s wheat harvest is
expected to be 12.3 million tons in 2012, down 10 million tons
from the year-earlier period, Adamenko told reporters today in
Kiev.  To contact the reporter on this story:
