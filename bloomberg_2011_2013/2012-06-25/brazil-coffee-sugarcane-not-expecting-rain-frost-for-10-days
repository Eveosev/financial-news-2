Brazil  is expected to be frost-free
and without rain in areas that produce coffee or sugarcane for
the next 10 days, according to Somar Meteorologia.  Last weekâ€™s heavy rain affected the coffee harvest and
quality of production, Somar, a Sao Paulo-based weather analyst,
said in an e-mailed report today. Cold weather hurt the
sugarcane harvest as well, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
