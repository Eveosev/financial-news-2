Demand for  new U.S. homes  rose more
than forecast in May as  mortgage rates  dropped, bolstering the
residential real-estate market while other parts of the world’s
largest economy cool.  Purchases climbed to a 369,000 annual rate, the most since
April 2010 and up 7.6 percent from the prior month, the Commerce
Department reported today in  Washington . The median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey of 67 economists was 347,000. The number
of houses on the market held near a record low.  Falling borrowing costs may keep luring buyers to builders
like  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , even as a cooling job market and
limited access to credit restrain the recovery. The  Federal
Reserve  last week extended a program to keep long-term  interest
rates  low in a bid to reduce  unemployment , sustain housing and
prevent a global slowdown from stalling the expansion.  “It’s another sign of life in the housing sector,” said
 Brian Jones , a senior U.S. economist for Societe Generale SA in
 New York , who forecast a gain to 362,000. “It’s consistent with
a gradual improvement in activity, but we’ve got miles to go
before we get back to normal.”  Stocks dropped amid concern that a meeting of European
leaders later this week will fail to help contain the region’s
debt crisis. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.6 percent
to 1,313.72 at the 4 p.m. close in New York. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.60 percent from 1.68
percent late on June 22.  BIS Report  Elsewhere, the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for
International Settlements said in its annual report published
yesterday that central banks in developed nations are
confronting the limits of their ability to aid economic recovery
as government efforts to strengthen finances fall short.  Bloomberg survey estimates for U.S. new-home sales, which
are counted when contracts are signed, ranged from 327,000 to
375,000. The April reading was unrevised at the previously
estimated 343,000, while March and February were revised up.  The median sales price increased 5.6 percent from the same
month last year, to $234,500, today’s report showed. Prices have
climbed on a 12-month basis since February, the best performance
in five years.  Purchases rose in two of four U.S. regions last month, led
by a 37 percent jump in the Northeast, while the South climbed
13 percent. Demand dropped 11 percent in the Midwest and 3.5
percent in the West.  Lean Supply  The number of newly constructed houses on the market was at
145,000 compared with the record low of 144,000 reached in April
and March. The record high of 572,000 was reached in July 2006.
The supply of new houses on the market at the current sales pace
dropped to 4.7 months, the lowest since October 2005, from 5
months in April.  In response to improving demand, builders  broke ground  on
516,000 single-family houses last month at an annual pace, up
3.2 percent from April and the most this year, the Commerce
Department reported last week.  The Washington-based National Association of Home
Builders/Wells Fargo  sentiment index  rose by 1 point this month
to 29, the highest since May 2007, another report last week
showed.  Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Toll Brothers, the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, on May 23 reported second-quarter profit
that beat estimates as orders jumped.  Suppliers Benefit  United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  and  Lennox International Inc. (LII) ,
makers of heating and air conditioning units, are among
companies benefitting from developers’ positive outlook. Lennox,
based in Richardson,  Texas , had a 40 percent increase in sales
to new-home builders in the first quarter.  United Technologies ,
in Hartford,  Connecticut , forecasts about 700,000 housing starts
this year, Chief Financial Officer Gregory Hayes said.  “The expectation is we’re not going to see a huge recovery
in the U.S. residential marketplace, but we should see a steady
recovery,” Hayes said at a June 14 conference. “Residential is
coming back, but it’s very, very slow.”  The stabilization in housing has boosted builder shares
this year. The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilder
Index has climbed 33 percent this year through June 22, compared
with a 6.2 percent gain for the broader  S&P 500 .  Residential construction hasn’t contributed to economic
growth over the course of an entire year since 2005, when it
accounted for 0.4 percentage point of the 3.1 percent increase
in gross domestic product. From 2006 through 2009, the
homebuilding slump subtracted 0.8 percent point from growth on
average. The declines diminished over the past two years.  Shrinking Share  Newly constructed houses made up 6.7 percent of the
residential market last year, down from a high of 15 percent
during the boom of the past decade.  Sales of existing homes  declined  in May as fewer
distressed properties reached the market, the National
Association of Realtors reported last week. The decline in
transactions involving foreclosures and short sales, where a
lender agrees to accept less than the balance of the mortgage,
helped push the median price of a previously owned house up 7.9
percent from the same time last year, the biggest 12-month gain
since February 2006.  Less competition from existing houses and even lower
mortgage rates may keep spurring the market. The  average rate  on
a 30-year fixed loan dropped to 3.66 percent last week, the
lowest in data going back to 1972, according to  Freddie Mac .  The central bank last week aimed to keep borrowing costs
low. Policy makers announced they will expand the Operation
Twist program to extend the maturities of assets on its balance
sheet. They said they stood ready to take further action to put
unemployed Americans back to work. Fed officials also lowered
their outlook for growth and employment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
