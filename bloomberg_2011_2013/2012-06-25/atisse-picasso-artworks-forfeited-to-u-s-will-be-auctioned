The U.S. Marshals Service is
overseeing an online auction of etchings attributed to 
Rembrandt and lithographs by Chagall, Matisse and Picasso 
that were forfeited to the government after federal cases.  The deadline for bids is 2 p.m. U.S. central time on July
2, said Jason Rzepniewski, auction manager for  Gaston & Sheehan 
Auctioneers, which is conducting the sale.  “It could easily exceed $1 million,” Rzepniewski said of
the 245-lot sale.  Seventeen of the lots belonged to  Marc Dreier , the New York
law firm founder who pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges.
Those lots include  Robert Wilson ’s 2006 video of actress  Salma Hayek  on a 42-inch plasma screen, which has a minimum price of
$21,000. A framed print of “Untitled IV” by Kenneth Noland has
a minimum bid of $3,150.  To contact the reporters of this story:
