New Jersey  Democrats, who control
the state Legislature, passed a $31.7 billion budget that
Governor  Chris Christie , a Republican, has signaled he may
oppose because it would delay a tax cut.  The Assembly passed the measure 48-31 in a party-line vote
today that drew no support from Republicans, following similar
action in the Senate. Passage sends the spending plan to
Christie, 49, who has objected to conditions put on tax relief
for residential property owners.  The Democrats’ plan replaces the governor’s proposed 10
percent income-tax cut with a credit for property levies that
would be delayed until midway through the fiscal year, to see if
revenue growth meets Christie’s targets. The spending outline he
proposed in February projected a 7.3 percent revenue gain for
fiscal 2013, the most since before the last recession.  “We all want property-tax relief, but we will be
responsible and patient in implementing it,” Senator  Paul Sarlo , a Wood-Ridge Democrat who is chairman of the Budget
Committee, said during floor debate on the measure.  “I will not allow New Jersey to go back to the same failed
policies that nearly put our state over a fiscal cliff,”
Christie said, according to a statement sent by  Michael Drewniak , the governor’s spokesman, after the Assembly vote.
“Tax relief for our hardworking families is long overdue and
that is exactly what I will continue fighting for.”  ‘Resounding No’  Christie, who faces re-election in 2013, last week called
the Democrats’ budget bill “a loud, resounding no to tax relief
for hardworking New Jerseyans.” Today he blamed “Corzine
Democrats” for the stance, a reference to former Governor  Jon Corzine .  “If they want to fight they’re going to get one all long,
hot summer until they cut your taxes,” Christie said at a June
22 town-hall meeting in Readington.  Assemblyman Declan O’Scanlon, a Little Silver Republican
who serves as his party’s budget officer, said he anticipates
Christie will veto $100 million in “phantom spending cuts”
added by Democrats.  “The folks on the other side of the aisle just have not
gotten the message from the people of New Jersey that they need
tax relief,” he said in an interview following the votes.
“It’s going to be a good budget once the governor gets done
with it.”  Big Spender  The budget unveiled by Christie in February is the largest
in  five years . His proposed spending increase was the biggest in
the nation, according to the  National Governor’s Association .  State Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff has since said that
revenue through June 2013 may be $700 million less than
projected by Christie, while the Legislature’s chief budget
analyst has said the gap may be twice as much.  The Democrats’ plan spends $62 million less than
Christie’s, Sarlo said. It sets aside $183 million for property-
tax credits until lawmakers are confident the state has enough
revenue to fund the payments, he said.  His colleague on the Budget Committee, Senator Jennifer Beck, a Red Bank Republican, called the lack of a  tax cut  “a
kick in the shins to our citizens” before she voted no.  “We’re not rooting for failure,” said Assemblyman Gary Schaer, a Passaic Democrat who is second-in-command of the
budget panel. “We want to see that the revenue is coming in
before we spend it.”  Millionaire Tax  Bills to cut or raise taxes must be introduced separately
from the budget. Assembly Democrats passed a measure that would
boost income levies on those earning more than $1 million a
year, to help pay for the tax credits. Christie has twice vetoed
such increases and has said he’ll do so again.  The governor last year trimmed almost $1 billion in
spending items added to the budget by Democrats in the week
before the July 1 beginning of the new fiscal year.  Under the state constitution, Christie and lawmakers must
put a balanced budget in place by July 1 or the state runs out
of money and the government starts to shut down. Christie now
has the ability to veto the spending plan outright, remove some
provisions through line-item vetoes or to sign it into law as
is.  To contact the reporters on this story:
