CEZ AS (CEZ)  may have to sell several 800-
megawatt power plants to avoid a multibillion-koruna fine from
the European Commission’s anti-monopoly bodies for breaching
competition rules,  MF Dnes  reported in its weekend edition,
without saying where it got the information.  CEZ may propose selling the Chvaletice, Pocerady,
Detmarovice plants, or the Tisova and Melnik III facilities to
meet the commission’s requirement, the newspaper said.  Both CEZ and the commission declined to comment, the
newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
