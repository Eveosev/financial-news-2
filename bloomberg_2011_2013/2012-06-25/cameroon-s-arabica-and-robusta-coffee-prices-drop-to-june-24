The export price for both arabica
and robusta coffee from Cameroon declined in the week to June
24, according to Bloomberg calculations made using daily export
prices from the Cocoa and Coffee Board.  The average rate for arabica beans was 1.4 percent lower at
1,647 CFA francs a kilogram (2.2 pounds), while robusta fell 1.1
percent to 986 francs, the figures, sent in a mobile-phone text
message from the Douala-based board, indicated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
