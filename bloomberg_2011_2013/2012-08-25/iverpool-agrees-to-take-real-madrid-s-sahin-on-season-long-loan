Liverpool has agreed to sign Real
Madrid playmaker Nuri Sahin on a season-long loan, the Premier
League club said on its website.  Sahin, who was also linked with a move to Arsenal, helped
Real win the Spanish league title last season after joining the
club from German champ Dortmund. The 23-year-old was the
Bundesliga player of the year for the 2010-11 season.  Sahin has also played 31 times for  Turkey , scoring his
first national team goal at the age of 17 against  Germany  in
2005.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
