German  government bonds  gained, with
10-year yields falling the most in seven weeks, as concern euro-
area growth has stalled and the sovereign debt crisis is
worsening fuelled demand for safer assets.  Benchmark yields  dropped to a three-week low after
purchasing managers’ indexes showed the region’s service sector
shrank in August and German manufacturing contracted for a sixth
month. Spanish and Italian bonds pared earlier gains as the
 European Central Bank  was said to wait until a court ruling
before unveiling details of a plan to buy the securities of the
most-indebted nations. Bunds also rose as Federal Reserve
minutes showed policy makers were ready to increase stimulus.  “In  Germany , services PMI was below 50, which was a
concern because it signifies some weakening,” said Mohit Kumar,
head of European fixed-income strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in
 London . “What really started the rally in bunds were the dovish
Fed minutes.”  The German 10-year yield dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, this week to 1.36 percent at 5 p.m. in London
yesterday, the biggest decline since the period ended July 6. It
fell to 1.32 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 3. The 1.75
percent bond due in July 2022 rose 1.305, or 13.05 euros per
1,000 euro ($1,255) face amount, to 103.615.  Spain ’s  10-year yield  was little changed this week at 6.42
percent after dropping to 6.15 percent on Aug. 22, the lowest
since June 11. Similar-maturity Italian rates ended the week
seven basis points lower at 5.71 percent. They earlier fell as
much as 22 basis points.  Services Shrink  A gauge of euro-area  services  declined to 47.5 this month
from 47.9 in July, London-based Markit Economics said Aug. 23. A
German manufacturing index was at 45.1 in August, Markit said,
below the level of 50 that signals contraction. German  economic
growth  slowed to 0.3 percent in the second quarter, from 0.5
percent in the previous three months, the Federal Statistics
Office said the same day.  With Germany’s  Constitutional Court  set to rule on the
legality of  Europe ’s permanent bailout fund on Sept. 12,
investors looking for ECB President  Mario Draghi  to announce a
definitive purchase program at his Sept. 6 press conference
might be disappointed, according to two central-bank officials,
who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations
are not public.  Many Fed “members judged that additional monetary
accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless
incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable
strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery,” according
to the minutes of the central bank’s July 31-Aug. 1 meeting
released on Aug. 22 in  Washington .  Italy will sell zero-coupon bonds on Aug. 28, and Spain is
scheduled to auction bills on the same day.  Germany’s bonds returned 3.7 percent this year through Aug.
23, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds lost
2.3 percent, and  Italy ’s gained 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
