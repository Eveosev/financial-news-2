Tropical Storm Isaac was leaving the
coast of  Haiti  on a path toward eastern Cuba and then the
Florida Keys, where it is forecast to arrive tomorrow at
hurricane strength, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  The Keys and parts of southern Florida’s west coast were
put under a hurricane warning today, while areas of the state’s
southeastern coast are on a  hurricane watch , the center in Miami
said in an advisory on its website just before 5 a.m. local
time.  Isaac had maximum sustained winds of 60 miles per hour and
was moving northwest at 14 miles per hour. The system was
centered about 145 miles south of Great Inagua Island.  To contact the reporter on this story:
