Iceland’s Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir dismissed Finance Minister Oddny Hardardottir in
a move designed to prepare the government for next year’s
parliamentary elections and reduce the number of ministries.  Hardardottir, 55, will be replaced by former Industry
Minister Katrin Juliusdottir, 37, on Oct. 1, according to a
statement on the website of Sigurdardottir’s Social Democratic
Alliance. The consolidation is the second since the government
took office in April 2009. The north Atlantic island’s next
parliamentary elections are in May.  The reduction of ministries to eight from 10 was approved
by parliament on May 11 and is set to take place on Sept. 1. A
new Industry and Innovation Ministry will replace the Ministry
of Industry, Energy and Tourism and the Ministry of Fisheries
and Agriculture. The duties of the Ministry of Economic and
Business Affairs will be divided between that new ministry and
the  Ministry of Finance , which will be renamed the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs. The  Environment Ministry  will be
renamed the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources.  With these changes “Johanna Sigurdardottir has managed
what no other government has managed, despite beautiful
promises, to reduce the number of ministries in one term by
four,” according to the  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
