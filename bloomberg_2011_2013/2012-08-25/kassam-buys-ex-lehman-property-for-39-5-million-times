Firoz Kassam, head of the Firoka
Group of companies, paid 25 million pounds ($39.5 million) in
cash for a London property that was once owned by Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the  Times  newspaper reported.  Kassam, the former owner of British soccer club Oxford
United, bought the Hornbeams estate in The Bishops Avenue, one
of the most expensive streets in the U.K. capital, and has
permission to turn the site into a 90 million-pound luxury
development, the newspaper said, citing an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
