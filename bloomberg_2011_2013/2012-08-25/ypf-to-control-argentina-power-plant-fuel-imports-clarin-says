YPF SA (YPFD) , the former Repsol SA unit
nationalized by the Argentine government in April, will import
all fuels for the country’s thermal power plants, daily  Clarin 
reported.  The move is part of the government’s bid to tighten control
over the electricity industry, the newspaper said, citing Deputy
Economy Minister Axel Kicillof. The government plans to overhaul
electricity rates to ensure “reasonable profits,” Clarin cited
Kicillof as saying.  Kicillof, who met yesterday met with officials from 70
power companies, said a state entity will manage all electricity
sales income and pay out profits to companies at rates set by a
regulator, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
