Sweden’s government may buy as many
as 60 of  Saab AB (SAABB) ’s Gripen E/F aircraft to lower costs as part of
an agreement with Switzerland about the purchase of the
company’s next-generation fighter jet.  In a statement today, Saab said it welcomed the Swedish
government’s announcement that it reached agreement with
Switzerland about the procurement of the aircraft.  “No costs have been disclosed as there is no contract in
place,” Sebastian Carlsson, a spokesman for Linkoeping-based
Saab, said in a phone interview. “The government will present
their budget on Sept. 20 for next year, and later this year,
parliament will vote on it.”  The Swiss government agreed in November to buy 22 of the
aircraft for 3.1 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion).  It said today that the  Department of Defense  signed a
“framework agreement” with Sweden for the purchase of the
jets, completing  a memorandum of understanding signed by
Swedish Defense Minister Karin Enstroem and Swiss Defense
Minister Ueli Maurer on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
