The recapitalization of  Greece ’s
four largest banks will not be completed until the end of the
year, or in early 2013, at the soonest, newspaper  To Vima  said,
without citing anyone.  The original plan for 10 percent of recapitalization funds
to come from the private sector may be revised either up or
down, the Athens-based paper reported in a preview of an article
to be published in tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
