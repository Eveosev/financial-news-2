Greece  may have to find a total of
17.9 billion euros ($22.4 billion) in spending cuts over the
next two years,  Real News  said, citing an unidentified senior
Finance Ministry official.  Three billion euros in cuts will be needed to fill revenue
gaps for this year, while another 1 billion euros in reductions
will be needed to cover state-owned companies that are unable to
repay state-guaranteed loans to creditors, the Athens-based
newspaper said in a preview of an article to be published in
tomorrowâ€™s edition.  Those 4 billion euros are in addition to the 11.7 billion
euros in cuts to be identified in early September, and 2.2
billion euros of reductions to compensate for projected
decreases in  tax revenue  and social security contributions, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
