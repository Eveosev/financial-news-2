Bank of Cyprus Pcl  is freezing a
plan to exchange its Greek assets for the Cypriot assets of one
of the Greek banks operating in Cyprus,  ekathimerini  said,
citing unnamed sources.  The main reason for the decision is the absence of reliable
estimates regarding bad loans both in Greece and Cyprus at a
time when a further deterioration of the economies in both
countries is expected, the English-language version of the
Kathimerini newspaper reported on its website today. It didnâ€™t
name the Greek bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
