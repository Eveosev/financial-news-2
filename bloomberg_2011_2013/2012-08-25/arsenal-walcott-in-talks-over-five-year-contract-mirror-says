Arsenal and winger Theo Walcott are
in negotiations over a new five-year contract, the Daily Mirror
said.  Walcott’s current deal expires after next season, leading
to fears Arsenal may look to sell rather than lose him for
nothing, the Mirror said. The club sold captain  Robin van Persie 
to  Manchester United  last week after he said he wouldn’t extend
his contract after next season.  Walcott, 23, currently earns 70,000 pounds ($111,000) per
week and Wenger is hoping a raise making him one of the highest-
paid Gunners will convince him to re-sign, the Mirror said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
