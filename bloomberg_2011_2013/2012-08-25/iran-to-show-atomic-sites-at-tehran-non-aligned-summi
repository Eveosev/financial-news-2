Iran  will allow officials from the
120-member Non-Aligned Movement to visit nuclear facilities
during a summit in Tehran this month, the Foreign Ministry said.  The visits will be arranged according to the interests of
“our guests,”  Ramin Mehmanparast , a ministry spokesman, said
at a press conference in Tehran today. Iran will also schedule
trips to industrial and scientific sites, he said.  United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said on Aug.
23 that he will attend the gathering in Iran’s capital from Aug.
26-31 that will also include Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
and Indian Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh . Syrian Foreign
Minister Walid Al-Muallem will also attend meetings during the
summit, Mehmanparast said.  Iran is under UN and international sanctions for its
nuclear program. Countries including the U.S. and Israel say it
is seeking to develop atomic weapons and the effort must be
halted. Iran says the program is for civilian purposes.  Talks during the summit will focus on Middle East issues
and developments in Africa and  South America , Mehmanparast said.
“On the sidelines of the meeting, there is an opportunity to
negotiate about Syria’s crisis and talk over the plan that Iran
suggests for the issue,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
