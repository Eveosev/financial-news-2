President  Barack Obama  leads
Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  by nine percentage points in
Pennsylvania, according to a poll of 601 likely voters released
today by The Philadelphia Inquirer.  Obamaâ€™s 51 percent to 42 percent lead puts him ahead in a
state that could give him 20 of the 270 electoral votes he needs
to win re-election.  In 2008, Obama beat Republican John McCain in Pennsylvania,
55 percent to 44 percent. The state has voted for the Democratic
candidate in the past five elections.  The telephone poll was conducted Aug. 21-23 and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.  Editors: Ann Hughey, Christian Thompson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
