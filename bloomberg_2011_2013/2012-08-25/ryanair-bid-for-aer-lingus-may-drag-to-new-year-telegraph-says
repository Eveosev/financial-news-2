Ryanair Holdings Plc’s (RYA)  bid for  Aer
Lingus Group Plc (AERL)  may drag on into January while the European
Commission starts a full investigation, the Telegraph said,
without citing where it got the information.  The EC has until Wednesday to decide whether it will begin
a so-called Phase II enquiry into the deal, which is opposed by
Aer Lingus’s management. A full enquiry would take 90 working
days, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
