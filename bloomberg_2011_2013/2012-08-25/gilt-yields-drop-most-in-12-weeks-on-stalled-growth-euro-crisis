U.K. government bonds rose, with 10-
year yields dropping the most in 12 weeks, as signs economic
growth has stalled in Britain and the euro area spurred demand
for safer investments.  Benchmark bonds gained for a third day yesterday as a
government report confirmed the U.K. economy shrank last
quarter, boosting speculation the  Bank of England  will keep its
benchmark rate at a record low. Gilts also gained as purchasing
managers’ indexes showed European services and manufacturing
output contracted for a seventh month and Greek Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras said his nation needed more time to meet its
economic targets. The pound strengthened against the dollar.  “The euro-zone and sovereign-debt issues will continue,”
said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank
Plc in London. “Weak PMI data from the peripheral European
countries exacerbates their problems. It pushes investors into
the safe havens, causing gilt yields to tighten. Official rates
in the U.K. are likely to be low for a long time.”  The 10-year gilt yield dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, this week to 1.53 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday, the biggest decline since the period ended June
1. The 4 percent bond due in March 2022 gained 1.365, or 13.65
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,582) face amount, to 121.835.  U.K. gross domestic product shrank 0.5 percent in the
second quarter, after contracting 0.3 percent in the previous
three months, the  Office for National Statistics  said.  Other Measures  Bank of England policy makers next meet on Sept. 6. Minutes
of their most recent meeting released Aug. 15 showed they voted
unanimously to keep their bond-purchase target unchanged and
said they will assess the need for other measures in light of
the impact of a credit-boosting program.  A gauge of euro-area  services and manufacturing  was 46.6
this month,  Markit Economics  said Aug. 23, below the level of 50
that signals contraction. German  economic growth  slowed to 0.3
percent last quarter, from 0.5 percent in the previous three
months, the Federal Statistics Office said the same day.  Gilts have returned 3.3 percent this year through Aug. 23,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds rose
3.7 percent.  Samaras used interviews this week with German and French
newspapers to call for more time for his nation to meet its
program targets as European officials look for ways to stave off
an immediate crisis.  The pound strengthened 0.8 percent this week to $1.5820,
and declined 0.8 percent to 79.24 pence per euro.  The U.K. plans to auction a combined 3 billion pounds to
28-, 91- and 182-day bills on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
