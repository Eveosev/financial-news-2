CC Sabathia came off the disabled
list to allow one run in 7 1/3 innings, leading the  New York
Yankees  to a 3-1 win at the Cleveland Indians.  Sabathia got the win, improving his record to 13-3 this
season, after missing two weeks with soreness in his left elbow.
The left-hander allowed four hits and struck out nine.  Nick Swisher  drove in all three runs for New York (73-52),
which increased its American League East division lead to 3 1/2
games over the Tampa Bay Rays, who lost 5-4 to the Oakland
Athletics.  Swisher had a run-scoring double in the first inning and
broke a 1-1 tie in the seventh with a two-run homer last night.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
