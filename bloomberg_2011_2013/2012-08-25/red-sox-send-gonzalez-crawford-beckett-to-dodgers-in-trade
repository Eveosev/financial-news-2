The Boston Red Sox sent first
baseman Adrian Gonzalez, pitcher Josh Beckett and outfielder
Carl Crawford -- the team’s three highest-paid players -- to the
Los Angeles Dodgers as part of a nine-player trade.  Boston also sends infielder Nick Punto and about $12
million in cash according to USA Today, to Los Angeles in
exchange for first baseman James Loney, right-handed pitcher
Allen Webster, infielder Ivan DeJesus and two players to be
named later, the Major League Baseball teams said in separate
 new releases .  “We recognized that we are not who we want to be right now
and it’s been a large enough sample of performance going back to
last year,” Red Sox general manager Ben Cherington said in a
news conference in Boston, according to ESPN. “We felt like in
order to be the team that we wanted to be on the field we needed
to make more than cosmetic changes.”  The Red Sox had MLB’s third-highest payroll before the
trade at $173.2 million, behind the  New York  Yankees at $198
million and the Philadelphia Phillies at $174.5, according to
USA Today’s baseball  salary database . The Dodgers ranked 12th
with $95.1 million in player salaries.  According to the paper, Gonzalez is making $21.9 million
this season, Crawford is earning $20.3 million and Beckett will
be paid $17 million.  They join a Dodgers team that has a 68-58 record and is
three games behind the San Francisco Giants in the National
League’s Western Division and 1 ½ games out of the NL’s final
wild-card playoff spot.  Not Contending  Boston is fourth in the American League’s Eastern Division
with a 60-66 record, 13 ½ games behind the first-place Yankees
and 8 ½ games out in the AL wild-card race.  The trade comes as the Red Sox have struggled after the
departures of former manager Terry Francona and general manager
Theo Epstein, who put together World Series winners in 2004 and
2007.  Boston didn’t exercise its option to extend Francona’s term
with the club, which began with its first championship since
1918 and ended after the Red Sox blew a nine-game lead for a
playoff spot in September. Francona led the team to the playoffs
five times in eight seasons.  In October, Epstein announced he would leave the Red Sox to
join the Chicago Cubs as president of baseball operations. The
youngest general manager in major-league history when he was
hired in 2002, Epstein had a year left on his contract.  The Red Sox have become one of the most underperforming
clubs in MLB this season, leading to the trade that sent three
of the team’s biggest disappointments to the Dodgers.  On the Mend  Meanwhile, Los Angeles is on the mend after becoming
embroiled in the divorce settlement of former owners Frank and
Jamie McCourt. The Dodgers emerged from bankruptcy and were sold
to Guggenheim Baseball Management LLC in May. The new management
team, including Guggenheim Partners executive Mark Walter and
Basketball Hall of Fame’s Magic Johnson, are looking to add
talent and rebuild a storied franchise that has won six World
Series titles, tied for fifth-most in baseball.  “We continue to do everything in our power to strengthen
our team for the stretch drive in an effort to reach the
postseason,” Dodgers General Manager Ned Colletti said after
the biggest trade in  team history . “This trade today
exemplifies ownership’s commitment to making the team as good as
possible not only for 2012 but for many seasons to come.”  All-Star  Gonzalez, 30, is batting .300 with 15 home runs and 86 runs
batted in this season. The four-time All-Star and a three-time
Gold Glove winner has hit 30 homers and driven in 100 or more
runs four times over his nine-season career with Texas, San
Diego and Boston.  Crawford, 31, is batting .282 with three homers, 19 RBI and
five stolen bases. He’s appeared in four All-Star games in 11
seasons with Tampa and Boston.  Beckett, a 32-year-old right-hander, is 5-11 with a 5.23
earned run average in 21 starts this season. A three-time All-
Star and most valuable player of the 2003 World Series while
with the Florida Marlins, he’s 130-92 with a 3.92 ERA over 12
major-league seasons.  Punto, 34, is batting .200 in 65 games off the Red Sox
bench this season.  Loney, 28, was batting .254 with four homers and 33 RBI in
his seventh season in Los Angeles. He’s a .284 career hitter
with 71 homers and 451 RBI.  DeJesus, 25, has appeared in 40 games with the Dodgers over
the past two seasons, batting .231 with four RBI. Webster, 22,
has yet to appear in the major leagues and was 6-8 with a 3.55
ERA in 27 games, with 22 starts with the Dodgers’ Double-A
minor-league affiliate at Chattanooga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
