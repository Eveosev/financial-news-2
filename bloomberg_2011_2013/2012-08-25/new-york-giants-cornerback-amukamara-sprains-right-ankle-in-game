New York  Giants cornerback Prince
Amukamara suffered a high right ankle sprain in last nightâ€™s
preseason game against the Chicago Bears, further depleting what
already is an injury-riddled defensive secondary.  Amukamara, 23, missed the first nine games of his rookie
season last year with a broken left foot.  The Giants already are missing cornerback  Terrell Thomas 
with a knee injury and cornerback Jayron Hosley, their third-
round draft pick this year, with turf toe.  The Bears rallied from a 10-point halftime deficit to
defeat the Giants 20-17 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford,
New Jersey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
