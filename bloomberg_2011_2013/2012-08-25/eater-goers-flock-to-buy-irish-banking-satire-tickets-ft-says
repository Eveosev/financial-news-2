A musical comedy about the Irish
banking crisis, in which puppets play the parts of former Prime
Minister  Bertie Ahern  and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , is
proving popular with theater-goers in Dublin, the Financial
Times reports.  About 40 percent of tickets to “Anglo: the Musical” have
been pre-sold, the FT reports. The musical, which focuses on the
collapse of Anglo Irish Bank Corp., will run for 10 days in
November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
