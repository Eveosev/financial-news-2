Manchester United striker  Wayne
Rooney  may miss four weeks after suffering a leg injury in
today’s 3-2 Premier League win over Fulham.  Rooney tried to block a shot from Hugo Rodallega in the
second half and the Fulham forward’s foot came down across
Rooney’s right thigh, leaving a deep gash. Rooney was taken off
on a stretcher and manager Alex Ferguson said after the match he
was taken to the hospital.  “It’s a very bad one,” Ferguson said on United’s website.
“It looks as he’ll be out for maybe four weeks.”  That would rule Rooney out of England’s first two World Cup
qualifiers against Moldova and Ukraine next month, along with
the start of the  Champions League .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
