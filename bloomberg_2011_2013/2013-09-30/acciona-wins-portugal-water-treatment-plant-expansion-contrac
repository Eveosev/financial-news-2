Acciona SA (ANA) , a renewable energy
company that’s built more than 70 desalination plants worldwide,
won a contract to expand the Monte da Rocha water-treatment
plant in the Alentejo district of Portugal.  The 3.5 million-euro ($4.7 million) contract in Ourique
means about 2 million people, or almost a fifth of Portugal’s
population, are served by Acciona Agua drinking and water-treatment plants, the Alcobendas, Spain-based company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
