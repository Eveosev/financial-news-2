The British Conservative Party
opened its annual conference with a video tribute to  Margaret Thatcher , who died this year. Then activists paid homage in the
approved free-market manner: by shopping.  The official “Our Maggie” stall at the conference center
in Manchester, northern  England , was piled with Thatcher-branded
merchandise. The “Little Iron Lady” baby vests sold out
immediately. “Iron Baby” bibs were still available. Party
members were offered the prospect of drying their crockery with
a tea towel quoting her comment that “You may have to fight a
battle more than once to win it.”  The back of the stall was stocked with “Our Maggie” beer,
described as “a golden hoppy ale” that offered “a good
balance of malt and fruity hop on the nose and the palate.”
Absent was a planned ironing board cover, rejected because it
turned out to be a fire risk.  “It wasn’t very heat-proof,” Scott Seaman-Digby, the
party’s commercial director, said as he unpacked more baby
vests. “We thought it could be potentially dangerous, because
it melts.”  John Glen, a Tory Member of Parliament, showed off his new
cuff links. On one sleeve: “You Turn If You Want To,” and on
the other: “The Lady’s Not For Turning.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
