Tennessee Titans quarterback Jake Locker is seen missing four to eight weeks after he was carted
off the field with an injured hip yesterday in the team’s 38-13
victory over the  New York  Jets, ESPN said.  Locker is undergoing tests, the network reported today
citing unidentified people familiar with the 25-year-old’s
treatment. Initial X-rays were negative and the team doesn’t
believe the injury to be season-ending, according to the report.  Titans spokesman Robbie Bohren said in an e-mail that the
team wouldn’t comment on Locker’s condition until coach  Mike Munchak ’s press conference this afternoon.  Locker was injured in the third quarter after a hit from
Jets defensive lineman Muhammad Wilkerson. Locker lay motionless
on the field for several minutes before being removed on a
motorized cart and taken to a hospital.  The Titans are 3-1, tied with the  Indianapolis Colts  for
first in the American Football Conference South division. The
team plays the Kansas City Chiefs (4-0),  Seattle Seahawks  (4-0)
and defending National Football Conference-champion San
Francisco 49ers (2-2) in their next three games before a bye
week.  Locker has completed 62.2 percent of his passes this year
for six touchdowns and no interceptions. Ryan Fitzpatrick will
probably start in his absence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
