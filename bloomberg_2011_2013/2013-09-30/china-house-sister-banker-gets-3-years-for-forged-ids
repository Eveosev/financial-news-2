A former banker who used forged
identification cards and documents to purchase several Beijing
apartments was sentenced to three years in prison,  China ’s
official Xinhua News Agency reported.  The People’s Court of Jingbian County in China’s
northwestern Shaanxi province ruled that Gong Aiai, dubbed
“House Sister” by Chinese netizens, illegally bought Beijing
residence permits to buy the properties, Xinhua reported
yesterday, citing the court.  Gong, former deputy head of the Shenmu County Rural
Commercial Bank in Shaanxi, was found to have four residence
permits and 44 Beijing properties valued at about 395 million
 yuan  ($64 million), according to the Xinhua report. Police found
no evidence that Gong illegally obtained the money to purchase
the real estate.  China’s government started efforts to curb property prices
in April 2010. It has raised down-payment and mortgage
requirements and enacted purchase restrictions in about 40
cities, including capping the number of homes people can own and
requiring new residents of a city to wait a year or more before
buying.  Beijing banned single-person households from buying more
than one residence, according to a March posting on the Beijing
Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural Development’s
website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
