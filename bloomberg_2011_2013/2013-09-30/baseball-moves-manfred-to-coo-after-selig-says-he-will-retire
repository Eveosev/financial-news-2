Rob Manfred  was promoted to chief
operating officer of Major League Baseball less than a week
after Commissioner  Bud Selig  said he would retire when his term
expires after next year.  Manfred, an MLB employee since 1998, had been executive
vice president for economics and league affairs. In his new job,
he is responsible for day-to-day management of the
commissioner’s office in New York, MLB said in a news release.  Manfred was mentioned last week by sports management
analysts as among the top prospects to succeed Selig, who said
on Sept. 26 that he is retiring. MLB is reorganizing its
management structure to “facilitate an orderly transition,”
Selig said in today’s statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
