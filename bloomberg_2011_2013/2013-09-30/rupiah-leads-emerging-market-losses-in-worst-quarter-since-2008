Indonesia ’s rupiah is leading
declines in  emerging markets  this quarter, completing its worst
three-month performance since 2008, as a record current-account
deficit deterred investors.  Government bonds  fell.  The currency weakened 14 percent since the end of June to
11,580 per dollar as of 4:24 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest loss
among 24 developing-nation exchange rates tracked by Bloomberg.
The rupiah fell 5.7 percent in September and 0.4 percent today.  The  current-account gap  will probably rise to 3.6 percent
of gross domestic product this year, from 2.8 percent in 2012,
according to Barclays Plc. While overseas investors sold a net
$730 million of Indonesia stocks this quarter, they added 1.1
trillion rupiah ($96 million) to their sovereign  debt holdings ,
the least since the second quarter of 2012, official data show.  “Weak confidence due to the sustained current-account
deficit is the main factor,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , a Singapore-based economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd.,  Southeast Asia ’s
largest bank. “The current-account recovery will not be too
significant until the first half of next year, so it will be
difficult to see a rebound in the rupiah.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards declined 12 percent this
quarter and 1.6 percent in September to 11,616 per dollar, 0.3
percent weaker than the onshore spot rate today after trading as
much as 6.6 percent lower on Aug. 27. The contracts fell 1.5
percent today.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the forwards was set at
11,613 per dollar, compared with 9,981 at the end of June,
according to the Association of Banks in  Singapore . The
reference was set 2.8 percent lower today, from 11,296 on Sept.
27, biggest drop since February 2009.  Trade, Inflation  Data tomorrow may show the trade deficit in Southeast
Asia’s biggest economy narrowed to $2.1 billion last month,
compared with a record $2.3 billion shortfall in July, according
to an ING Groep NV research report today authored by  Tim Condon ,
head of Asia research in Singapore.  “With softening domestic demand and associated import
compression, we expect the current-account deficit to improve to
3.1 percent of GDP in 2014,” said  Prakriti Sofat , an economist
at Barclays Plc in Singapore. “The weakness in the rupiah is
driven by the structural current-account deficit, concerns about
policy management and global market volatility.”  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed 287 basis points, or 2.87 percentage points, to 17.01
percent this quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Negative Sentiment’  Indonesia’s  trade deficit  probably narrowed to $811 million
in August, while inflation accelerated to 9 percent in September,
from 8.8 percent last month, according to median estimates in
Bloomberg surveys before reports due tomorrow. The central bank
will announce foreign-reserves figures as soon as Oct. 3.  “Negative sentiment around these prints combined with  risk
aversion  elsewhere in the world, should drive rupiah
underperformance against the rest of the region,”  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in
Singapore, wrote in a research note today.  Bank Indonesia  has raised its benchmark  interest rate  four
times this year, most recently by 25 basis points in September
to 7.25 percent. The move is intended to accelerate the
adjustment in the current account, according to a Sept. 12
statement from the central bank posted on its website.  Indonesia’s local-currency government bonds are the worst
performers among 10 Asian debt indexes compiled by HSBC Holdings
Plc this year with a loss of 12.7 percent.  The yield on the 5.625 percent notes due May 2023 climbed
138 basis points from June 30 to 8.51 percent and is up 332
basis points in 2013, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. The rate rose for a third straight quarter,
the longest stretch since the period ended June 2008, and
advanced 12 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
