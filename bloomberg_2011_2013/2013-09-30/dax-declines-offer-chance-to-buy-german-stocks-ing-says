Germany ’s  DAX Index (DAX) , which has
fallen to the lowest level in more than two weeks, may decline
further before rebounding from near its 50-day moving average,
according to ING Groep NV.  The benchmark gauge for German equities has retreated 1.1
percent in the last three trading sessions, the longest losing
streak since Aug. 21. While the DAX may drop to 8,455, or 1.3
percent from its current level, the measure will rebound if it
falls to its average price over the last 50 days, currently
8,395.82, according to Roelof-Jan van den Akker, a senior
technical analyst at ING. The DAX sank 1.1 percent to 8,570.23
at 1:53 p.m. in  Frankfurt  today.  “The former falling trend line and the 50-day moving
average line are both offering solid support around the 8,400
level,” Amsterdam-based Van den Akker wrote in a report today.
“Therefore, we should consider this short-term weakness as an
interesting buying opportunity.”  The DAX has lost 1.4 percent since reaching a closing high
of 8,694.18 on Sept. 19 as political wrangling fueled concern
the U.S. government will shut down for the first time in 17
years and as Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta struggled to
save his administration. The index has  rallied  13 percent in
2013 and is still up 5.7 percent in September after the  Federal
Reserve  unexpectedly refrained from paring bond purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
