Spain is considering using Treasury
cash instead of bank loans to pay off as much as 7 billion euros
($9.5 billion) of commercial debts on behalf of regional
governments and town halls, according to two people familiar
with the matter.  Government officials are considering this option to reduce
the reliance on banks, which financed the program last year, as
funding conditions in the bond markets are improving, said one
of the people, who asked not to be named before a decision on
the matter. Officials still have to decide how much of the cash
will come from the Treasury and how much from banks, the person
said.  Spain  borrowed  about 35 billion euros from 26 banks in May
last year to finance the first part of the plan, which aims to
channel liquidity to companies threatened by local
administrations that haven’t paid their bills. Since then, the
yield on Spanish bonds has tumbled and the Treasury’s cash
reserves have risen 65 percent, allowing officials to bypass the
banking system and use cheaper market funding.  A spokesman for the Economy Ministry, which runs the
Treasury, declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  The government expects to make the payments in November,
one of the people said. The Budget Ministry has to review the
adjustment plans submitted by the regions and local authorities
next month before the payments can be made to suppliers, said a
ministry spokesman who asked not to be named in line with
government policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
