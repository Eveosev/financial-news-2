Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the maker of
products from flash-memory chips to steam turbines, will cut the
number of workers in its global television operations by half to
3,000 as it boosts outsourcing of production.  As much as 70 percent of TV output will come from other
manufacturers by the year ending March 31, 2015 from 40 percent
now, Tokyo-based Toshiba said in a  statement  today. The company
is targeting cost reductions of 20 billion yen ($204 million),
spokesman Toru Ohara said by phone.  Japanese TV makers are struggling with stalling demand and
falling prices amid competition from South Korean rivals
including  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) 
Toshiba is expanding in semiconductors, medical systems and
energy amid falling sales of liquid-crystal-displays and 100
billion yen of TV losses in the past two years.  “In TVs it’s difficult to compete against the South Korean
makers and Toshiba wasn’t able to add extra value to its TVs,”
said Tsunenori Ohmaki, an analyst at Tachibana Securities Co. in
 Tokyo . “It’s positive for Toshiba to take action before losing
more money.”  The company will restructure its visual and home-appliance
business and close two of the three internal TV production sites
it has overseas, the company said. Ohara decline to say which
plants it will keep.  Toshiba had about 206,000 workers as of March 31, according
to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  Power Systems  The company last month forecast operating profit will
double in three years, rising to 400 billion yen in the 12
months ending March 2016 from 194 billion yen last fiscal year.
Toshiba forecast sales of 7 trillion yen in the year ending
March 2016.  Toshiba fell 1.1 percent to 440 yen at the close in Tokyo.
The stock has risen 31 percent this year, compared with a 39
percent gain for  Japan ’s Topix index.  The company got 43 percent of last year’s sales from its
Social Infrastructure unit, which included power systems and
medical equipment. Digital products, such as TVs and personal
computers, accounted for 24 percent of revenue, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
