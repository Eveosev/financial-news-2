Ugandan inflation accelerated to a
13-month high in September, giving the central bank scope to
raise its policy rate for the second straight month.  The  inflation rate  climbed for a third month to 8 percent
from 7.3 percent in August, Chris Mukiza, director of
macroeconomic statistics, told reporters today in the capital,
Kampala. Prices rose 1.4 percent in the month, he said.  Uganda ’s central bank on Sept. 3 increased its benchmark
 interest rate  for the first time in almost two years to 12
percent from 11 percent to curb inflation, which is above its
official target of 5 percent over the medium term.  Monetary policy makers will next meet Oct. 2. Forecasts in
a Bloomberg survey of four economists and analysts range from an
unchanged decision to a 1 percentage point increase.  Annual food-crop prices rose 16.2 percent from 12.9 percent
in August, while  core inflation  quickened to 6.9 percent from
6.6 percent, Mukiza said.  Higher prices for food, which accounts for 27 percent of
the consumer-price basket, stemmed from “decreased food
supplies on the market as a result of moving out of the
harvesting season,” Mukiza said. Prices of dietary staples
including bananas, potatoes, beans, milk and fish increased in
the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
