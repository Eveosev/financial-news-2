Citgo Petroleum Corp. plans to
perform maintenance on a fluid catalytic cracker at its  Lake
Charles , Louisiana, refinery in the first quarter of 2014, a
person familiar with the schedule said.  The work will probably take place in January or February,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  Fernando Garay , a Citgo spokesman in Houston, declined to
comment. Citgo is owned by a subsidiary of Petróleos de
Venezuela SA, the national oil company of Venezuela.  A fluid catalytic cracker upgrades heavy gasoil into
lighter, more valuable transportation fuels.  Citgo’s Lake Charles plant, about 50 miles (80 kilometers)
east of Port Arthur, Texas, can process 440,000 barrels a day of
crude, the sixth-largest in the U.S., according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It processes heavy crude, the company’s  website 
shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
