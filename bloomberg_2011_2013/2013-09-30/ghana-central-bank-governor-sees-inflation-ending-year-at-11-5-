Ghana ’s  inflation  rate may end the
year at 11.5 percent as a stable currency helps negate the
effects of utility tariff increases, central bank Governor Kofi Wampah said.  “We may have higher inflation in the next two months
before we start coming back,” Wampah said in an interview in
the capital, Accra. “We will continue to support the market
with dollar offers as we build up more foreign reserves.”  The  Bank of Ghana  is boosting foreign-currency reserves
through Eurobond sales and cocoa trade-finance loans, while
investor confidence is returning to the  bond market  after the
 Supreme Court  upheld President John Dramani Mahama’s victory in
the December election, he said.  Consumer prices in the West African nation declined for the
first time in seven months to 11.5 percent in August from 11.8
percent a month before, the statistics agency said Sept. 11.  Foreign-currency reserves increased to $5.8 billion in
August from $5.3 billion in December, Wampah said on Sept. 18.
Electricity tariffs will rise by 78.9 percent from tomorrow and
water charges will go up by 52 percent, the Public Utilities
Regulatory Commission said Sept. 25.  Inflation will return to the central bank’s target of 2
percentage points above or below 9 percent in the first half of
2014, Wampah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
