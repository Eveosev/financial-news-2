India’s rupee headed for its best
month in a year after the central bank took steps to boost
dollar supply and the U.S. maintained stimulus that’s buoyed
 emerging markets .  The Indian currency has rebounded 9.8 percent from a record
low of 68.845 per dollar touched Aug. 28 after the  Federal
Reserve  said Sept. 18 it will continue $85 billion a month of
bond purchases.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Raghuram Rajan
allowed local banks this month to borrow more from abroad and
offered to swap the funds, along with foreign-currency deposits
raised from citizens living abroad, at concessional rates.  “We don’t think the Fed will taper until March of next
year, so that opens up a window for the market where liquidity
is ample,” said Mirza Baig, head of currency and interest-rate
strategy in  Singapore  at BNP Paribas SA. The bank recommends
buying the rupee, saying “sentiment has turned” in its favor
since Rajan took charge of the RBI on Sept. 4.  The rupee advanced 4.8 percent this month to 62.7075 per
dollar as of 10:15 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the best performance
among 11 most-traded Asian currencies, and pares a quarterly
loss to 5.3 percent. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
557 basis points, or 5.57 percentage points, in September to
15.16 percent. That’s the biggest drop since January 2009.  U.S. Budget  The rupee fell 0.4 percent today amid a U.S. budget
stalemate that raises the risk of the first government shutdown
in 17 years. Italy’s government is on the verge of collapse
after allies of former leader  Silvio Berlusconi  said they’d quit
the cabinet.  India’s  current-account  deficit probably widened to $23
billion in the three months through June from $18.08 billion the
previous quarter, a Bloomberg survey showed before official data
due after market hours today.  One-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.5 percent from
Sept. 27 to 63.33 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Offshore non-deliverable contracts rose 0.1 percent to 63.58.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
