Turkish soccer champion Galatasaray
hired  Roberto Mancini  as coach to replace the fired Fatih Terim.  Mancini, 48, joins on a three-year contract, the Istanbul
club said  on its website  yesterday. His first game in charge
will be at Juventus tomorrow in the Champions League.  The Italian coached  Inter Milan  to three Serie A titles and
in 2012 led  Manchester City  to its first English league
championship in 44 years. He was fired by City in May after the
team finished second to  Manchester United  in the Premier League,
was upset by Wigan in the F.A. Cup final and finished last in
its Champions League group.  Galatasaray is 10th in the Turkish Super League having won
just one of its first five games and was routed 6-1 at home by
Real Madrid in its  Champions League  opener on Sept. 17.  Itâ€™s the second time that Mancini has been hired to replace
Terim, having previously succeeded the Turkish coach at Italian
club Fiorentina in 2001.  Terim, 60, was fired after he rejected a two-year extension
to his contract, the club said last week.  Mancini will get a salary of 3.5 million euros ($4.7
million) this season and 4.5 million euros for each of the next
two campaigns, Galatasaray said in a release to the Istanbul
stock exchange. There are also performance-linked bonuses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
