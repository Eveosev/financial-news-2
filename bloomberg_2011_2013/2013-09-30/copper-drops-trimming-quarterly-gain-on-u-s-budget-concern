Copper fell for the first time in
four days, paring the best quarterly advance since March 2012,
on concern the U.S. government is headed for a partial shutdown.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange lost as much as 0.6 percent to $7,254 a metric ton and
traded at $7,280 by 10:43 a.m. in Tokyo. The drop trimmed this
quarter’s gain to 7.8 percent, the biggest since March 2012.  The  House of Representatives  voted 231-192 yesterday to
stop many of the Affordable Care Act’s central provisions for
one year, tying it to an extension of U.S. government funding
through Dec. 15. Should the Senate reject the bill today the
government could be shut down from tomorrow.  “The U.S. budget concern put downward pressure on most
markets,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at commodities broker
Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo. “The market also remained subdued as
demand will slow during the Chinese holidays.”  Markets in China will be closed Oct. 1-7. China’s
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics rose to 50.2 in September from 50.1 in August, less
than last week’s 51.2 preliminary reading and the 51.2 median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Futures for delivery in December fell 0.5 percent to
$3.3125 a pound on the Comex in New York. Metal for delivery in
December on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was little changed at
52,390  yuan  ($8,546) a ton.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc, nickel, lead and tin also
declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
