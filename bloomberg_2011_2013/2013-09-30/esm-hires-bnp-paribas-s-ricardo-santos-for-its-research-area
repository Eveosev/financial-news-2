The European Stability Mechanism
said it hired former BNP Paribas SA economist Ricardo Santos for
its research department.  Santos joined the institution in the past few weeks, said a
Luxembourg-based spokesman at the ESM, who asked not to be named
in line with agency policy. Santos started work with his new
employer earlier this month, according to his LinkedIn profile.
He worked for BNP Paribas in  London  from 2012 covering European
economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
