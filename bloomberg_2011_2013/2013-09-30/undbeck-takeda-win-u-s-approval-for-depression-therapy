H. Lundbeck A/S and  Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co. (4502)  won approval for the drug Brintellix to treat
people with major depressive disorder, U.S. regulators said.  Major depressive disorder is one of the  most common  mental
disorders in the U.S. affecting about 7 percent of U.S. adults
each year, according to the National Institutes of Health. The
condition interferes with a person’s ability to work, sleep,
study, eat and enjoy once-pleasurable activities.  “Since medications affect everyone differently, it is
important to have a variety of treatment options available for
patients who suffer from depression,” Mitchell Mathis, acting
director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research, said in a statement.  Peak sales of the drug may reach $1 billion to $2 billion
and Lundbeck plans to hire more than 200 salespeople in the U.S.
to market the medication, Chief Financial Officer Anders Gotzsche said in an interview in August. Sales of Brintellix may
help offset losses from Lundbeck’s Lexapro that began facing
generic competition in 2012. Lexapro went from generating $474
million in sales in 2011 to an estimated $8 million this year.  Lundbeck, based in Copenhagen, will co-promote the drug
with Osaka, Japan-based Takeda.  Generic drugs are available to treat depression as well as
 Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) ’s Cymbalta and  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s Seroquel XR.  To contact the reporter on this story:
