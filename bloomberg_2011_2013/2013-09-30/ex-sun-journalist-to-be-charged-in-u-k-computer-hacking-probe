A former journalist at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s
U.K. tabloid the Sun will be charged as part of a computer-hacking investigation, prosecutors said.  Ben Ashford, the first to be charged in London police’s
Operation Tuleta, faces two counts of possession of criminal
property and unauthorized access to computer material, the  Crown
Prosecution Service  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Operation Tuleta opened in July 2011 following police-led
probes into phone hacking and bribery at News Corp.’s U.K.
newspapers. Police widened their investigation into computer
hacking and corporate spying to include people and companies
beyond the press in July.  Ashford, 34, has been ordered to appear at a London court
Oct. 15. A spokeswoman at News Corp.’s U.K. unit declined to
comment on the arrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
