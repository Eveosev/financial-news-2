Hog futures fell the most in seven
weeks after a government report showed that the U.S. herd
unexpectedly grew. Cattle prices dropped.  The U.S. herd increased 0.3 percent to 68.36 million hogs
from 68.172 million, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
Sept. 27. Ten analysts in a Bloomberg News survey projected a 1
percent decline, on average. The inventory of animals available
for slaughter also topped forecasts.  “The hogs, for market, are there, and the slaughter
numbers will come,”  Dennis Smith , a senior account executive at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 1.7 percent to
close at 86.625 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, the biggest drop since Aug. 7. Prices
touched 86.275 cents, the lowest since Sept. 23. Volume was 19
percent higher compared with the average of the prior 100
trading sessions.  As of Sept. 27, cash-hog prices were up 23  percent  from a
year earlier after U.S. slaughter rates declined. Hog slaughter
is estimated to increase 1 percent in November and December from
2012, according to Chris Hurt, a professor of agricultural
economics at  Purdue University  in  West Lafayette , Indiana.  The gain in the hog herd signaled an outbreak of porcine
epidemic diarrhea virus may have caused fewer pig deaths than
forecast. The virus has been identified in 17 states since
April, according to the  American Association  of Swine
Veterinarians. Mortality in piglets is as high as 100 percent, a
National Animal Health Laboratory Network report showed Sept.
25.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$1.31975 a pound on the CME. Prices gained for eight sessions
through Sept. 27, the longest stretch since November 2008.
Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement rose 0.2 percent
to $1.652 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
