Seventy-four Chinese fishermen were
missing after a typhoon in the  South China Sea  sank three ships,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported today.  The boats sank yesterday with 88 fishermen aboard near the
Xisha Islands, 330 kilometers (205 miles) south of the southern
island of Hainan, Xinhua said, citing the Hainan maritime search
and rescue center. Fourteen fishermen were rescued, it said. The
islands are also claimed by  Vietnam , which calls them Hoang Sa.  China deployed nearby ships to look for the missing
fishermen though rescue efforts were hindered by the storm,
Xinhua said. President  Xi Jinping  ordered the military to help
in the search, according to Xinhua.  China upgraded its wave warning yesterday to orange from
yellow, the second-highest level in its weather warning system,
with the approach of the typhoon, dubbed Wutip, Xinhua said. The
storm is expected to hit central Vietnam tomorrow, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
