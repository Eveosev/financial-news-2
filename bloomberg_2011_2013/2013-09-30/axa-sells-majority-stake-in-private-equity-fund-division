Axa SA (CS) ,  France ’s biggest insurer,
sold a majority stake in its private equity unit to its
management, led by founder Dominique Senequier.  The transaction values Axa Private Equity, which oversees
about $36 billion, at about 510 million euros ($690 million),
the Paris-based insurer said in a statement today. The business
will change its name to Ardian.  Axa will cut its stake to about 23 percent, leaving the
unit’s managers with about 46 percent of the company and a group
of investors including a number of unidentified French family
offices with the remainder, the company said today.  The French insurer will invest about 4.8 billion euros in
Ardian’s funds between 2014 and 2018. The insurer said in
September 2011 it was reviewing the future of its private equity
business and in March 2013 entered exclusive talks with
Senequier, who started the unit in 1996.  “We spent a long time building a company inside Axa and,
from the start, we carved out a separate identity for investment
excellence,” she said in today’s statement. “Our investment
skills will serve our clients well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
