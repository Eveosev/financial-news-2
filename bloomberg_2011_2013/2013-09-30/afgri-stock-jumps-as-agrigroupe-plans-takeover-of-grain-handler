Afgri Ltd. (AFR)  rose the most in almost
five years after AgriGroupe Holdings Pty. Ltd. said that it
plans to acquire the South African handler of grain.  Afgri  jumped  as much as 15 percent, the steepest intraday
gain since December 2008, and was trading up 14 percent at 6.64
rand at 10:42 a.m. in Johannesburg, valuing the company at about
2.49 billion rand ($246 million). Volume was more than double
the three-month daily average.  Closely held AgriGroupe will make a cash offer of 7 rand a
share for Centurion-based Afgri, excluding a 3.3-cent per-share
dividend due to shareholders in November, and intends to
terminate its stock exchange listing, the companies said in a
statement on Sept. 27. Some of Afgri’s  managers  will hold a
stake of about 5 percent in AgriGroupe and will abstain from
voting in any  shareholders’ meeting  on the transaction, the
companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
