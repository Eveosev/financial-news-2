Asian  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index paring its biggest monthly gain since 2012, on
concern the U.S. government is headed for a shutdown amid a
budget stalemate.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which gets 31 percent of its revenue in
 North America , declined 2.6 percent. Mizuho Financial Group
Inc., Japan’s third-largest bank, sank 4.1 percent after its
lending unit was penalized by Japan’s banking regulator for
failing to end transactions with “anti-social” groups.  BHP
Billiton  Ltd., Australia’s biggest oil producer, dropped 1.7
percent as crude fell.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index dropped 1.5 percent to 138.65
as of 5:10 p.m. in  Tokyo , with all 10 industry groups on the
gauge falling. It’s headed for a 6.5 percent increase this
month, the most since January 2012, and is up 6.2 percent this
quarter. Even if Congress resolves the budget fight by the Oct.
1 deadline, U.S. lawmakers would move to the next fiscal dispute
over raising the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling.  “There’s no agreement among the government at the moment,
and if they can’t agree on the budget, there’s no way they are
going to agree on the debt ceiling,” said  Andrew Sullivan ,
director of sales trading at Kim Eng Securities in  Hong Kong .
“It’s the end of quarter and so you may see people looking to
sell into the recent strength, locking gains, on expectations
the U.S. government does shut down.”  The September gains pushed valuations on the Asia-Pacific
measure to 13.7  times  estimated earnings as of Sept. 27 from
12.7 at the end of August, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with 15.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 14.3 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, the data show.  Regional Gauges  Japan’s  Topix index  slumped 1.9 percent as the yen gained,
weighing on exporters, and a report showed industrial production
fell more than expected in August. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is
scheduled to speak tomorrow on his plans for a sales-tax
increase and an economic-support package.  South Korea’s Kospi index lost 0.7 percent and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index dropped 1 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index fell 1.7 percent, paring its biggest quarterly gain in
four years as record-low  interest rates  boost profits. Taiwan’s
 Taiex Index  slipped 0.7 percent and Singapore’s Straits Times
Index fell 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.5 percent.  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.7 percent. Hong Kong’s markets
are shut tomorrow for a holiday, while today was the last day of
trading for mainland markets until Oct. 8.  Budget Impasse  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  slipped 0.8 percent today
after the gauge declined 0.4 percent on Sept. 27. Congress is
leaving itself just one day to end a budget stalemate that
raises the risk of the first government shutdown in 17 years.  The  House of Representatives  voted 231-192 yesterday to
stop many of the Affordable Care Act’s central provisions for
one year, tying it to an extension of U.S. government funding
through Dec. 15. Should the Senate reject the bill today the
government could be shut down from tomorrow.  Companies that do business in the U.S. dropped. Toyota,
Asia’s biggest carmaker, declined 2.6 percent to 6,270 yen.
Honda Motor Co., a Japanese carmaker that generates 47 percent
of its sales in North America, fell 2.7 percent to 3,735 yen.
 James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building materials supplier that
gets about 70 percent of sales from the U.S., slid 2.1 percent
to A$10.68 in Sydney.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for China from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics rose to 50.2 in September from 50.1 in
August, data showed today. The final number was less than last
week’s 51.2 preliminary reading and the 51.2 median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Gangster Loans  Mizuho Financial sank 4.1 percent to 213 yen. Japan’s
Financial Services Agency said on Sept. 27 it ordered Mizuho’s
banking unit to strengthen legal compliance and controls after
it failed to prevent more than two years of transactions with
“anti-social” groups, a term commonly used in  Japan  to
describe yakuza crime syndicates. Through consumer credit
companies, Mizuho Bank Ltd. made 230 loans valued at about 200
million yen ($2 million), the FSA said.  Energy producers dropped as crude oil fell to the lowest
price in almost three months on concern over the U.S. budget and
speculation threats to the Middle East oil supply are subsiding.  BHP Billiton lost 1.7 percent to A$35.74 in Sydney. Energy
explorer PetroChina Co. slid 1.7 percent to HK$8.56 in Hong
Kong.  Daphne International Holdings Ltd. (210) , a footwear maker that
sells Aerosoles shoes in China, tumbled 10 percent to HK$4.73 in
Hong Kong. Third-quarter sales remained weak, KGI Securities Co.
said in a note on Sept. 27, citing the company’s investor
relations department.  Among stocks that rose, Power Assets Holdings Ltd.
controlled by Asia’s richest man,  Li Ka-shing , climbed 2.6
percent to HK$69.40 in Hong Kong.  The company said it plans to
sell as much as a 70 percent stake in the electricity division
through a business trust structure. The spinoff may raise $5
billion, said two people with knowledge of the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
