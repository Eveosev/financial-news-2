Brazil ’s central bank increased its
2014 inflation forecast as a weaker currency undermines the
world’s biggest interest rate increase. Swap rates rose.  Consumer prices will rise 5.7 percent next year even if
policy makers raise the benchmark interest rate to 9.75 percent
by November, the quarterly inflation report published today
shows. The increase compares with a 5.2 percent forecast in June
and would mark the fifth straight year that inflation breaches
the 4.5 percent target. The central bank also cut its 2013
growth estimate to 2.5 percent from 2.7 percent.  Central bankers have increased the key rate by 175 basis
points since April, the most among 49 economies tracked by
Bloomberg, to arrest inflation that breached their target range
twice this year, eroding consumer and business confidence.
Traders increased bets today policy makers will raise the
benchmark rate by another half a percentage point to 9.5 percent
next month. Policy makers are tightening monetary policy to
mitigate the impact on prices of the second biggest decline
among major currencies in the past six months.  “The Committee highlights that in moments like now
monetary policy must remain particularly vigilant to minimize
the risk that high inflation rates, as observed during the last
12 months, persist,” the central bank said today.  Swap Rates  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015, the most
traded in Sao Paulo today, rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 10.23 percent at 3:57 p.m. local time. The
real gained 1.5 percent to 2.2195 per dollar, paring its six-month decline to 8.9 percent. The Australian dollar fell 10.5
percent in the same period.  Gradual Investimentos today raised its 2013 year-end
interest rate forecast to 10 percent from 9.5 percent on the
central bank’s inflation views, according to chief economist
 Andre Perfeito .  A higher 2014 inflation forecast together with a more
positive central bank outlook on global economic activity may be
driving interest rate futures higher, according to Enestor Dos Santos, principal economist at BBVA.  Officials have signaled they will keep in place a $60
billion currency intervention program that has helped strengthen
the real from an almost five-year low in August.  The central bank said its inflation outlook takes into
account a fiscal policy that will help close the gap between
demand and output. It said the government has room to shift
fiscal policy to neutral from expansionary.  The  primary budget  showed a deficit of 432 million reais
($195 million), the first deficit on record for the month of
August, due to slow economic growth and tax breaks that diminish
revenue, Tulio Maciel, head of the central bank’s economic
research, told reporters in Brasilia today.  Brazilian consumer pries, as measured by the IPCA-15 index,
rose 5.93 percent in the year through Sept. 12, the national
statistics agency said on Sept. 20. It was the first time in
nine months annual inflation slowed below 6 percent. The central
bank’s target range is from 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
