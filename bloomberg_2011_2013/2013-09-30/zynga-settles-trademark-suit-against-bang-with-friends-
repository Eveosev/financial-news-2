Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  settled a lawsuit
against the maker of “Bang With Friends,” a casual sex
Internet application, alleging infringement of Zynga’s trademark
for its “with friends” family of games.  Lawyers for the two companies asked a federal judge to
dismiss the case in light of the settlement, according to a
filing today in federal court in San Francisco.  “Although the terms of the settlement are confidential,
Bang With Friends Inc. acknowledges the trademark rights that
Zynga has in its with friends marks and will be changing its
corporate name and rebranding its services in the near future,”
Bang With Friends said in an e-mail.  Zynga claimed in its suit that Bang With Friends, which
makes an application that matches Facebook friends anonymously,
“selected the name ‘Bang With Friends’ for its casual sex
matchmaking app with Zynga’s game trademarks fully in mind.”
The name infringes a trademark covering games such as “Words
With Friends” and “Chess With Friends,” Zynga argued.  The San Francisco-based gamemaker had sought a court order
barring the company from using the name “Bang With Friends” in
connection with any social-networking applications.  The case is Zynga Inc. v. Bang With Friends Inc., 13-03517,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of  California  (San
Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
