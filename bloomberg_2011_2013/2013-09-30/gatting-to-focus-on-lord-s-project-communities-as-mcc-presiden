By Ben Priechenfried  Sept. 30 -- Former England batsman Mike Gatting says he’ll
concentrate on the redevelopment of Lord’s and on forging closer
ties with poorer communities when his one-year presidency of the
Marylebone Cricket Club starts tomorrow.  The renovation of the London facility will cost as much as
200 million pounds ($323 million) and includes underground
parking, extending the pavilion and replacing stands to boost
capacity by 2,700. Building work is scheduled to start next year
and take 15 years.  “Lord’s is such a special place,” said Gatting, who
scored more than 4,400 runs in 79 Tests. “Ground development
will be a major focus for MCC in the coming months,” he added
in an e-mailed statement. The MCC was founded in 1787 and owns
Lord’s as well as the Ashes urn that England and  Australia 
compete for.  Gatting, 56, also said he’ll use his presidency to “bring
the benefits of Lord’s to some people who need it closer to
home.”
