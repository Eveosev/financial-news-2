Spain will sell 243.9 billion euros
($329.2 billion) of bonds and bills next year to cover
refinancing needs and its  budget deficit , increasing its debt
burden to 99.8 percent of gross domestic product.  The debt-to-GDP ratio will rise from 94.2 percent at the
end of this year, according to the draft budget law posted on
the Budget Ministry’s website today. Pension payments will rise
0.25 percent and an increasing number of retirees will push the
government’s bill up 4.9 percent to 127 billion euros, as the
first leg of a social-security overhaul takes effect.  The central government’s budget, which sets aside 29.7
billion euros for  jobless benefits  and 36.6 billion euros for
interest payments, aims to cut the deficit without raising
taxes. The government is trying to shrink the budget gap by
broadening the tax base and will conduct a review of the tax
system next year.  The government is aiming for a deficit of 5.8 percent of
GDP next year, compared with a target of 6.5 percent this year.
The European Union, the European Central Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, the three institutions monitoring
the country’s bank bailout program, have all expressed concern
that Spain will miss its budget target for a fifth consecutive
year in 2013.  The 2014 budget is based on a growth forecast of 0.7
percent for next year. By comparison, the IMF forecast in July
the Spanish economy will stagnate next year while the EU in May
projected a 0.9 percent expansion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
