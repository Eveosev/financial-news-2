The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 5 basis points to 155 basis
points as of 8:27 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Standard Chartered Plc
prices show. The benchmark is set for its highest close since
Sept. 4, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index added 5 basis points to
125 as of 10:04 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices. The measure is poised for its highest level since
Aug. 28, according to data from CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 2 basis points to 94.5
as of 9:07 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The gauge is set for its biggest increase since Sept. 24, CMA
data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
