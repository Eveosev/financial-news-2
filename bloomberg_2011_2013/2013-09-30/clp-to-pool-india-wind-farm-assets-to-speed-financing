CLP Holdings Ltd. (2) ’s India unit has
agreed with three lenders to club revenue from its wind farm
assets to create a common pool to service debt.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ,  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  and IDFC Ltd. are
the lenders for India’s biggest wind-farm owner, CLP India Pvt.
said in an e-mailed statement. At present, each wind farm is
financed individually and debt repayments can only be made from
a specific project’s cash flows.  The company is the first wind-farm developer in the country
to set up such a structure, CLP India Managing Director Rajiv
Mishra said in a phone interview from the western city of
Ahmedabad. Pooling wind farm revenue to service debt is more
efficient for CLP, may reduce borrowing costs and also cut risk
for lenders, he said.  The deal will enable CLP  India  to accelerate expansion by
adding as much as 300 megawatts of new wind capacity a year to
its portfolio of about 1,000 megawatts, the company said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
