Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN) ,
Africa’s largest generic-drugs maker, will acquire
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s injectable thrombosis brands and a
manufacturing site for 600 million pounds ($970 million).  “The limited focus by GSK on this therapeutic area
represents an opportunity,” Aspen said in a statement today.
“GSK has not concentrated its promotion of the brands in many
of the  emerging markets  targeted by Aspen as future areas of
growth.”  Aspen will acquire the Arixtra and Fraxiparine/Fraxodi
brands and a specialized production site in France, it said.
Aspen will take over about 400 sales and marketing employees who
work on the brands in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent
States.  Aspen supplies medicine in more than 150 countries and had
sales of 19.3 billion rand ($1.9 billion) in the year through
June. Johannesburg-based Aspen started offering $2.04 billion of
acquisition loans to a bigger group of lenders to finance
purchases of assets and brands, the company said in a statement
on Sept. 13.  Aspen  shares  fell 1.2 percent to 265 rand at 2:26 p.m. in
Johannesburg, trimming this year’s gain to 57 percent, and
valuing the company at 120.8 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
