Ericsson AB (ERICB) ’s proposed takeover of
Red Bee Media Ltd. was referred for an in-depth antitrust review
by the U.K. Office of Fair Trading, which said the deal may lead
to higher prices for some services for broadcasters.  The deal may lead to higher prices or worse service among
linear playout providers, who ensure television programs are
lined up and ready for broadcast, the OFT said in a statement.
The OFT asked another regulator, the Competition Commission, to
take an additional look at the transaction.  Ericsson, the largest maker of wireless networks, agreed in
July to buy London-based media services company Red Bee Media
from a group led by Macquarie Advanced Investment Partners LP.
It didn’t disclose a purchase price.  “Not only is there the possibility of price rises as a
result of the merger, there is a risk the most complex channels
will suffer a reduction in quality in their service levels,”
said OFT Chief Executive Officer Clive Maxwell.  Ericsson said in a statement that it will work to address
the OFT’s concerns.  Red Bee Media’s customers include British Broadcasting
Corp., phone company  BT Group Plc (BT/A) , pay-television provider
British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc and the MTV unit of Viacom
Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
