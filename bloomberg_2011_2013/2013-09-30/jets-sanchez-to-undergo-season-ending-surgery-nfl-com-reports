New York Jets quarterback  Mark Sanchez  has decided to have season-ending shoulder surgery,
NFL.com reported.  Sanchez, 26, hurt the labrum in his right shoulder during
the Jets’ third preseason game on Aug. 24 and was placed on
injured reserve-designated for return, keeping him out for a
minimum of eight weeks. He was expected to play this season
after rehabilitating the injury, Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said on
Sept. 14.  Instead, he’ll have surgery that will require four to six
months of rehabilitation, the website said, citing an unnamed
person who was informed of the process.  The Jets declined to comment on Sanchez’s status, Jets
spokesman  Bruce Speight  said in an e-mail.  The decision may signal the end of Sanchez’s career with
the Jets. The fifth-year quarterback who  New York  drafted in
2009 is guaranteed $8.25 million this season, after which he’ll
be a free agent.  Rookie Geno Smith, whom the Jets drafted this year, has led
the team to a 2-2 record, throwing four touchdown passes and
eight interceptions while completing 57.4 percent of his passes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
