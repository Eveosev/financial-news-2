Varentec Inc., a designer of power-management systems and software, arranged $8 million in funding
from billionaire  Bill Gates  and  Khosla Ventures .  Varentec plans to use the Series B funding to finance
initial production and sales of grid-control systems that help
utilities correct voltage imbalances that may result from spikes
in consumption or clouds passing over solar plants, the San
Jose, California-based company said today in a statement.  “Our smart-power nodes have the muscle to move the voltage
instantly,” Chief Executive Officer Deepak Divan said in an
interview. “Utilities have no tools to control these
fluctuations. These funds will help us get to bigger
deployments.”  Billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures led Varentec’s
$7.7 million Series A funding round in December 2011, and the
company also has received funds from the U.S. Energy Department.  Varantec uses capacitors to temporarily boost or reduce
voltage on utility distribution systems, and to notify grid
operators of any potential disturbances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
