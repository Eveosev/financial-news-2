Philip Morris  International Inc.,
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, agreed to
buy a stake in Societe des Tabacs Algero-Emiratie for about $625
million to expand in  Africa .  The investment involves taking a 49 percent stake in United
Arab Emirates-based Arab Investors TA, which in turn owns 51
percent of the Societe des Tabacs Algero-Emiratie venture, New
York-based Philip Morris said today in a statement. Algeria’s
state-owned Societe Nationale des Tabacs et Allumettes SpA owns
the rest of the venture.  The acquisition gives Philip Morris, which gets all of its
sales outside of the U.S., a greater presence in Northern
Africa. Societe des Tabacs Algero-Emiratie already has partnered
with Philip Morris since 2005 and is licensed to manufacture its
Marlboro and L&M brands.  Algeria has the continent’s fourth-largest gross domestic
product and “tremendous potential for future growth,” Miroslaw Zielinski, president of Philip Morris’s Eastern Europe,  Middle
East  and Africa region as well as its duty-free operations, said
in the statement.  Philip Morris fell 0.8 percent to $86.59 at the close in
 New York . The shares have gained 3.5 percent this year, compared
with an 18 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
