The  University of Connecticut  fired
football coach Paul Pasqualoni after the Huskies started the
season with four straight losses.  Pasqualoni went 10-18 over his three seasons at the Storrs,
Connecticut-based school, including a 41-12 defeat to the
University at Buffalo on Sept. 28.  “I am making this change in our football coaching staff
now as we approach the conference season to see an improved
performance in our football program,” athletic director Warde
Manuel said in a statement.  Pasqualoni, 64, had also coached at  Syracuse University 
from 1991-2004, compiling a 107-59-1 record.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
