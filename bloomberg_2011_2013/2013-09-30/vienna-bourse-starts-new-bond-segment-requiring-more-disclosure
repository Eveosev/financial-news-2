Austrian stock market operator
Wiener Boerse AG said it’s creating a new section for corporate
bonds that requires issuers to provide greater disclosure on
earnings and ratings.  About 9.5 billion euros ($12.8 billion) of new securities
were sold in Vienna since 2012 and the bourse’s  corporate prime 
segment, which opens tomorrow, includes an initial 21 bonds by
nine issuers, Wiener Boerse said in an e-mailed statement.  “We want to make research easier for retail clients by
providing additional information,” Birgit Kuras, a Wiener
Boerse board member, said in the statement.  While there was only one initial public offering of shares
in the last six years in Vienna, companies are increasingly
issuing bonds to retail investors, with a record 48 new
securities offered in 2012 and 2013. The insolvency of builder
Alpine Holding GmbH this year, 13 months after it sold 100
million euros of securities, triggered criticism of issuers’
disclosure standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
