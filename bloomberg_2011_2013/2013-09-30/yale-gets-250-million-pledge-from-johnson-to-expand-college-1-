Yale University  received a $250
million pledge, the largest gift in its 312-year history, from
alumnus Charles B. Johnson to build two new colleges.  The donation will help Yale increase its residential
colleges to 14 and expand its undergraduate student body by
about 15 percent to more than 6,000, the university in New
Haven, Connecticut, said today in a  statement . Yale needs an
additional $80 million to break ground on the colleges, the
school said.  Johnson, 80, who played football at Yale before graduating
in 1954, retired last year as chairman of  Franklin Resources
Inc. (BEN) , a San Mateo, California-based  money manager . Johnson, who
joined the company in 1957 at age 24, has a personal fortune
worth $2.4 billion, according to data from the Bloomberg
Billionaires Index. Johnson’s previous gifts to Yale include
funds to renovate the football stadium, and to establish the
Johnson Center for the Study of American Diplomacy, which holds
the papers of  Henry Kissinger .  “This is an extraordinary commitment from one of Yale’s
most loyal alumni,” Yale President Peter Salovey said in the
statement. “It builds on Charlie’s long history of generosity
to Yale. Charlie has already done so much to shape our
international and athletics programs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
