An index of Chinese solar
manufacturers led by LDK Solar Co. and Suntech Power Holdings
Co. rose the most in eight weeks as China announced a tax rebate
for power produced from sunlight and more panel makers begin
developing their own projects.  The  NYSE Bloomberg Global Solar Index (SOLAR)  of 102 companies rose
2.6 percent to $712.58 at 5:45 p.m. in New York yesterday, the
most since Aug. 5. LDK gained 30 percent to $1.93 and Suntech
climbed 26 percent.  Chinese solar companies are rising because they’re starting
to expand into project development, a strategy that may boost
revenue and margins,  Gordon Johnson , an analyst at Axiom Capital
Management in New York, said yesterday in an interview. Panel
producers will also benefit from a 50 percent value-added tax
rebate the Ministry of Finance announced online Sept. 29,
Johnson said.  “The assumption is that the project business in China will
allow Chinese solar companies to sell modules to themselves,”
he said.  U.S. companies including  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and  SunPower
Corp. (SPWR)  already develop their own projects, and have reported
profits this year.  China’s solar market is accelerating, Deutsche Bank analyst
Vishal Shah wrote in a note on Sept. 27. Installations in 2014
are expected to reach an annual run rate of 13 gigawatts to 15
gigawatts, from 6 gigawatts to 7 gigawatts this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
