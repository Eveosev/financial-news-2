Thailand ’s baht had its best month
since July 2011 as foreigners increased holdings of the nation’s
assets after the  Federal Reserve ’s decision to refrain from
cutting its stimulus boosted demand for riskier assets.  Global funds  bought  $2.9 billion more Thai bonds than they
sold this month through Sept. 27 and poured a net $353 million
into equities, official data show. The Fed said on Sept. 18 it
wants to see more evidence of a recovery in the world’s largest
economy before tapering its $85 billion a month of bond buying.
The U.S. will release September jobs data on Oct. 4. The baht
rose today, after falling earlier amid concern a U.S. government
shutdown will endanger talks over raising its debt ceiling.  “The Fed’s decision not to taper its stimulus is the
biggest factor supporting regional currencies and we saw some
fund inflows,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of the fixed-income
business unit at Rakuten Securities Inc. in  Tokyo . “With the
U.S. fiscal issue looming, a risk-off sentiment is weighing on
the baht today.”  The currency climbed 2.8 percent this month to 31.27 per
dollar as of 3:41 p.m. in Bangkok, snapping five straight months
of declines and trimming this quarter’s loss to 0.7 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The baht rose 0.2
percent today after weakening as much as 0.4 percent.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected swings
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, increased 43 basis
points from the end of August and 13 basis points today to 7.64
percent. The gauge slumped 40 basis points this quarter.  Debt Issuance  Thailand had a $1.3 billion current-account surplus in
August following a revised deficit of $1.6 billion the previous
month, according central bank data today. The  Finance Ministry 
cut its 2013 economic growth estimate to 3.7 percent from 4.5
percent on Sept. 27, and projection for gains in exports to 1.8
percent from 5.5 percent.  Government bonds  rose in September as the finance
ministry’s Public Debt Management Office said it plans to sell
fewer securities next fiscal year. Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy will sell 375 billion baht ($12 billion) of
benchmark bonds in the period starting tomorrow, compared with
about 473 billion baht in the previous year.  ING Groep NV trimmed its prediction of Thailand’s 2013
gross domestic product growth to 3.2 percent from 4 percent and
forecast the Bank of Thailand will keep borrowing costs
unchanged “indefinitely,”  Tim Condon , head of Asia research in
 Singapore , wrote in a note today. “We consider monetary policy
bond-market friendly,” the note said, adding that the bank
affirms its year-end forecast for the 10-year yield at 4.35
percent.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023 slumped
39 basis points in September, the most since July 2012, to 3.92
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate slid one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
