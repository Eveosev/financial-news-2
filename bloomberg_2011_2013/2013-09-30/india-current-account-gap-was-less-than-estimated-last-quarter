India’s current-account deficit
widened less than economists estimated in the second quarter and
analysts including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said gold-import
curbs will help moderate a shortfall that’s hurt the rupee.  The  deficit  was $21.8 billion in April through June,
compared with $18.1 billion in the previous quarter, the  Reserve
Bank  of India said in a statement in Mumbai yesterday. The
median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a $23
billion gap. The current account is the broadest measure of
trade, tracking goods, services and investment income.  The monthly  trade deficit  has almost halved since May as
higher gold-import taxes deter inward shipments of a metal used
in India for everything from wedding jewelry to hedging against
inflation. The government aims to pare the current-account
imbalance from a record $87.8 billion in the fiscal year ended
March, part of efforts to support a currency that’s weakened 12
percent versus the dollar in 2013.  “Concerns over deficit financing are alleviating due to
improvement in the trade deficit in recent months and steps by
the central bank to boost dollar inflows,” said Tirthankar Patnaik, a strategist at Religare Capital Markets Ltd. in
Mumbai. The current-account gap will narrow to $55 billion this
financial year, easing pressure on the rupee, he said.  Rupee Climbs  The rupee strengthened 0.6 percent to 62.2675 per dollar as
of 12:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The S&P BSE Sensex index of stocks rose
0.5 percent. The yield on the 10-year note due May 2023 fell to
8.69 percent from 8.77 percent yesterday. The currency
appreciated 4.9 percent last month, helped by RBI Governor
Raghuram Rajan’s efforts to attract dollars.  The government has boosted levies on gold bullion bought
from abroad thrice in 2013 to 10 percent, most recently in
August. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said the same
month that  India  intends to compress imports of gold, silver and
some non-essential items, as well as demand for crude oil.  “We expect an improvement in the current account due to a
falling trade deficit,” Goldman Group analysts Tushar Poddar
and Vishal Vaibhaw said in a note. The current-account shortfall
will narrow to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product in the year
ending March 2014, from 4.8 percent of GDP the previous fiscal
year, they said.  India’s budget deficit in the first five months of the
fiscal year reached 74.6 percent of the target for 2013-2014,
another release showed yesterday.  Budget Deficit  The government doesn’t expect to exceed its borrowing
target for October through March, Economic Affairs Secretary
Arvind Mayaram told reporters in  New Delhi  today.  The administration is confident of achieving a fiscal gap
of 4.8 percent of GDP in 2013-2014 as targeted and containing
the current-account shortfall at $70 billion, he said.  India’s  imports  fell for three straight months through
August.  Exports (INMTEXUY)  climbed 13 percent that month from a year
earlier and the merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $10.9
billion, from $20.1 billion in May.  The current-account gap for 2013-2014 may be less than $60
billion and the depreciation in the rupee is probably helping
overseas sales to some extent, according to Barclays Plc.  The current-account deficit was 4.9 percent of GDP in April
through June, yesterday’s report showed. The central bank
estimates the sustainable level is about 2.5 percent of GDP.  India’s manufacturing shrank for a second month in
September, a purchasing managers’ index released by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics signaled today. The index rose
to 49.6 from 48.5 in August. A reading below 50 signals a
contraction.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s second term in office has
been marred by graft scandals, average consumer-price inflation
of about 10 percent in the past year and slumping economic
growth. HSBC Holdings Plc predicts expansion will slow further
to 4 percent in 2013-2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
