EON SE shut down  Sweden ’s biggest
nuclear power plant after a swarm of jellyfish made its way into
a cooling water inlet at the reactor on the Baltic coast.  The 1,400 megawatt Oskarshamn-3 unit, located about 340
kilometers (211 miles) south of  Stockholm , accounts for 5
percent of Sweden’s power supply, Anders Oesterberg, a spokesman
for EON, said by e-mail today.  “This situation is caused by a huge amount of jellyfish,
just one is definitely not enough to cause problems,”
Oesterberg said from Oskarshamn, Sweden. “The last time this
happened was in August 2005, when we had to shut down
Oskarshamn-1 because of a jellyfish invasion.”  Oskarshamn-3 was halted on Sept. 8 for maintenance and was
scheduled to resume output Sept. 27, according to a company
filing. EON,  Germany ’s biggest utility, owns 55 percent of the
plant, which was commissioned in 1985.  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  of  Finland 
owns the rest.  More information on the plant stoppage is expected later
today, according to an EON filing with the Nord Pool Spot
exchange in Oslo.  The jellyfish are part of the genus Aurelia, according to
Oesterberg. Known as moon jellyfish, they have pale translucent
bodies, are found mainly in coastal areas in Europe and North
America and may grow as large as 40 centimeters in diameter,
according to the online edition of the  Encyclopaedia Britannica .  To contact the reporter on this story:
