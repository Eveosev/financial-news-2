New Zealand Prime Minister John Key
said limits on low-deposit home loans are something buyers have
to tolerate if the nation wants to avoid faster interest-rate
increases.  “Like all medicines, I don’t necessarily like having to
swallow it either,” Key told TV3’s Firstline. “But what is the
best thing overall for the economy?”  From today, banks face restrictions on the amount of new
home loans they can make when the deposit is less than 20
percent of a property’s value. The nation’s central bank,
concerned a housing bubble is threatening financial stability,
imposed the limit because raising  interest rates  might boost the
currency and hurt the economy.  Opponents of the loan limits “are telling you they want
you to pay more for your mortgage,” Key said. “I want lower
interest rates.”  Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler said Sept. 12 that the
limits lower the bank’s projection for 90-day bank bill yields
by 30 basis points, or 0.3 percentage points.  Still, he said the central bank will have to start raising
rates next year. It expects yields to rise by 100 basis points
by the end of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
