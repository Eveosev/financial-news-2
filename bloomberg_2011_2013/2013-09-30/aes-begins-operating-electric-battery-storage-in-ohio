AES Corp. (AES) , a power provider in 23
countries, began operating a 40-megawatt electric battery
storage system in Ohio.  AES’ Dayton Power & Light utility will use the storage at
its Tait generating station in Moraine, Ohio, to stabilize an
electric grid that supplies electricity to more than 60 million
people, the company said today in a statement.  The facility is Ohio’s largest electric-storage system,
with 800,000 cells, and adds to 60 megawatts of battery capacity
the Arlington, Virginia-based company operates in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
