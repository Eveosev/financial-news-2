Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, agreed to an $869 million settlement with  Freddie
Mac  to resolve disputes over faulty loans sold to the
government-backed firm before Jan. 1, 2009.  The accord includes a one-time $780 million cash payment to
Freddie Mac and credits tied to previous buybacks, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said yesterday in a statement. The
firm already had set aside money to cover the cost of the
agreement, according to the statement.  “We do not expect the company to take an additional charge
for this settlement,” Joseph Morford, an RBC Capital Markets
analyst, wrote in a note to clients. “We are pleased to see
Wells move past more of its outstanding legacy issues, and we
believe this should be a slight positive for the stock.”  Home lenders including  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and Citigroup
Inc. have sought to resolve claims tied to faulty mortgages sold
to  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac, the U.S.-owned firms that took a
$187.5 billion bailout during the financial crisis. Citigroup
reached a $395 million deal with Freddie Mac last week and
announced a $968 million settlement with Fannie Mae in July.  ‘Repurchase Liabilities’  Wells Fargo’s agreement “resolves substantially all
repurchase liabilities related to loans sold” to Freddie Mac
before 2009, the bank said.  The lender’s shares fell 27 cents to $41.32 yesterday in
 New York . The stock has climbed 21 percent this year, matching
the  advance  for the 24-company  KBW Bank Index. (BKX)   Wells Fargo sold $343 billion of mortgages to Freddie Mac
in 2005 through 2008, according to data from Washington-based
Compass Point Research & Trading LLC. That compares with $212
billion sold to Fannie Mae.  U.S.-backed firms including Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had
outstanding demands as of June 30 that Wells Fargo repurchase
more than 6,300 loans with an original balance of $1.4 billion,
the bank said in a July 12 statement. About 89 percent of those
were for loans originated in 2006 through 2008, the bank said.  The bank continued to sell loans after the period covered
by the settlement, including $126 billion to Freddie Mac in 2009
and $155 billion to Fannie Mae, according to Compass Point.  The lender, led by Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf , 60,
also faced demands for refunds from private investors. Wells
Fargo had unresolved private claims tied to $258 million of
mortgages at the end of June, and $127 million more linked to
mortgage insurers, according to the July statement.  The bank had $2.2 billion in reserves for buying back
faulty mortgages at the end of the second quarter and has added
$6.5 billion to its reserves since 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Wells Fargo originated 23 percent of all U.S. home loans in
the first half of the year, or about $224 billion, according to
Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
