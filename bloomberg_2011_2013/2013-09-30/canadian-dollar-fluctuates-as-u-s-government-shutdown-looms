Canada ’s dollar touched a four-day
high after a report showed gross domestic product increased at
the fastest pace in two years in July, adding to evidence the
nation’s economy is rebounding from a second-quarter slowdown.  The currency strengthened versus its U.S. counterpart as
Canadian consumer sentiment climbed to the highest in more than
two years as employment rose and the country’s housing market
remained buoyant, according to the new Bloomberg Nanos Canadian
Confidence Index.  “There’s been a significant amount of bearish expectations
regarding Canadian growth, and overall it’s been a little bit
more positive recently,” said  Sebastien Galy , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in New York. “The
Canadian dollar has had a tendency to outperform.”  The loonie, nicknamed for the image of the aquatic bird on
the C$1 coin, appreciated as much as 0.3 percent to C$1.0275 per
U.S. dollar before erasing gains at day’s end to trade little
changed at C$1.0309 at 5 p.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar
buys 97 U.S. cents.  The currency touched C$1.0182 per U.S. dollar on Sept. 19,
a three-month high, after the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly
maintained the monetary stimulus it uses to lower borrowing
costs, easing concern that higher U.S. interest rates will slow
global growth.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bonds rose, pushing
yields down one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.54
percent. The 1.5 percent securities maturing in June 2023 added
10 cents to C$91.13.  Canadian Data  Statistics Canada  said  output  rose 0.6 percent to an
annualized C$1.58 trillion ($1.54 trillion), the biggest gain
since July 2011. GDP fell 0.5 percent in June, the biggest
decline since the 2009 recession. The median  forecast  in a
Bloomberg economist survey was for 0.5 percent growth in July.  The data “clearly represented a snap-back in economic
activity following a contraction,”  Adrian Miller , director of
fixed-income strategies in New York at GMP Securities LLC, wrote
today in a note to clients.  The Nanos Canadian Confidence Index, weekly measurement of
the economic mood of Canadians, rose to 59.75 in the period
ended Sept. 27, from 59.23 the previous week. That’s the highest
since March 2011 for the gauge, which tracks consumers’
perceptions of the strength of the economy,  job security , real
estate and their financial situation.  Option Volatility  Implied volatility for one-year options on the Canadian
dollar versus its U.S. counterpart reached 7.13 percent today,
the highest since Sept. 17. Implied volatility is used to set
option prices and gauge the expected pace of currency swings.
The average for this year is 7.39 percent.  Futures traders decreased their  bets  the Canadian dollar
will fall against its U.S. peer for a third straight week,
figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed. The difference in the number of wagers by
 hedge funds  and other large speculators on a decline in the
loonie versus those on a gain, known as net shorts, was 5,675 on
Sept. 24, compared with 18,764 a week earlier.  The one-year so-called 25-delta risk-reversal rate, which
measures the premium charged for the right to buy the  U.S.
dollar  against its Canadian counterpart versus contracts to
sell, rose to 1.73 percent, the highest in more than three
weeks. The 2013 average is 1.56 percent.  Trading in over-the-counter options for the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar pair amounted to $1.5 billion, making up 7.6
percent of the $19.7 billion daily total. Greenback-loonie
trading was 279 percent more than the average for the past five
Mondays at a similar time in the day, according to Bloomberg
analysis.  The loonie fell 3.3 percent in the past year against nine
other developed-nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Index. The yen lost 21 percent, and the
Australian dollar slid 9.2 percent. The U.S. dollar strengthened
2.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
