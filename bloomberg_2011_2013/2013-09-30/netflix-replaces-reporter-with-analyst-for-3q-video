Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the world’s largest
subscription-streaming service, said it will again hold a live
videocast of its quarterly results, replacing the CNBC reporter
who moderated the last time with a  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  analyst.  Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan Securities LLC will join BTIG LLC’s
 Richard Greenfield  on Oct. 21 to question Netflix Chief
Executive Officer Reed Hastings, Chief Financial Officer David Wells and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos on the company’s
third-quarter results, according to a statement today.  Anmuth replaces Julia Boorstin from CNBC, who co-hosted the
second-quarter event for the Los Gatos, California-based company
with Greenfield.  In the videocast format, the moderators choose questions
submitted in advance to put to the company’s executives.
Analysts, including Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities in Los
Angeles, criticized Netflix for using the approach last quarter
because it gives the appearance that parties moderating the
discussion are getting access to financial information ahead of
others.  Netflix plans to regularly rotate different people into the
position of moderator, Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman, has
said.  The company is modeling the video chat based on the format
for annual meetings at Berkshire Hathaway Inc., where analysts
and journalists pose questions to Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Warren Buffett , Friedland said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
