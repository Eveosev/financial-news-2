Soybean futures fell the most in
two months after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  reported
that  inventories  topped analyst estimates by 11 percent.  Stockpiles as of Sept. 1 were 141 million bushels, the USDA
said today in a  report . On Sept. 12, the agency estimated 125
million. Last week, 28 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
projected 127 million, on average. A gauge of demand in the
three months ended Aug. 31 fell 41 percent to 294 million
bushels from a year earlier. The agency increased its estimate
of 2012 output by 18.6 million bushels.  “Supplies are a little bigger than people expected,”
Randy Mittelstaedt, the director of research at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Without
a bullish surprise, the market is under pressure with the
harvest coming very quickly. Yields collected so far have been
better than expected, and now we’ll wait to see what happens to
the crops that were planted late because of the flooding.”  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 2.6 percent to
$12.86 a bushel at 12:13 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. A
close at that price would mark the biggest drop for a most-active contract since July 25. Earlier, the oilseed touched
$12.84, the lowest since Aug. 22.  Trading was 45 percent above the average in the past 100
days for this time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Through Sept. 27, the oilseed dropped 6.4 percent this year.  Reserves held on farms were 39.55 million bushels, compared
with 38.3 million a year earlier, the USDA said today. Supplies
stored in commercial grain silos fell to 101 million from 131.1
million.  Earlier this month, the agency said this year’s harvest
will be 3.149 billion bushels. The U.S. is the world’s biggest
grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
