Odewald & Cie., a Berlin-based
buyout firm, plans to sell the remaining parts of its packaging
machine maker Oystar Holding GmbH, people familiar with the
matter said.  After the sale of the pharmaceutical and cosmetic packaging
unit IWK, Oystar is now also disposing of its dairy and food
packaging businesses, said the people, who asked not to be
identified as the considerations are private. The two units will
be sold either together or separately and already attracted the
interest of private-equity bidders, they said.  Odewald is selling Stutensee, Germany-based Oystar, which
it acquired in 2007 for 255 million euros ($344 million), in
parts as that may generate a higher return compared to a sale of
the whole company. The dairy and food packaging businesses
generate annual sales of about 200 million euros with wrapping
machines for butter and cheese and bag-filling machines for dry
foods such as rice and pasta.  A spokesman for Odewald said the buyout firm regularly
receives and considers offers it gets for its packaging
business. He declined to comment on whether the company is
currently evaluating any bids.  Canada’s  ATS Automation Tooling Systems Inc. (ATA)  on Sept. 1
agreed to buy IWK, Oystar’s pharmaceutical and cosmetic
packaging unit, for C$133 million ($129 million). Oystar’s North
American operations were sold in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
