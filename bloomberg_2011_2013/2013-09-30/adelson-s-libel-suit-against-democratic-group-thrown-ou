Billionaire Sheldon Adelson’s
$10 million defamation lawsuit against the National Jewish
Democratic Council was thrown out by a federal judge.  U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan today
dismissed the suit by Adelson, a prominent backer of Republican
candidates including  Newt Gingrich  and  Mitt Romney , over an
article on the group’s website before the 2012 presidential
election.  According to Adelson, the chairman and chief executive
officer of  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , the organization falsely
claimed that he had approved of prostitution in his Macau
casinos. Adelson, 80, said the council, its president, David
Harris, and its chairman, Marc Stanley, “crossed the threshold
from constitutionally protected speech to defamation of a public
figure.”  Oetken ruled that the group’s statements consisted entirely
of fair reports of a judicial proceeding and constitutionally
protected opinions. He applied Nevada’s anti-SLAPP law, which
targets “strategic lawsuits against public participation,”
ordering Adelson to pay the defendants’ attorney fees and
litigation costs.  Adelson said the group’s article claimed he had approved of
prostitution in his Macau casinos and urged Romney to cease
accepting his donations. The article cited allegations made in a
separate lawsuit by a former employee of  Sands China Ltd. (1928) 
Adelson denied the claims.  The suit is Adelson v. Harris, 12-cv-6052, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
