Antero Resources Corp. (AR) , the
natural-gas company backed by  Warburg Pincus  LLC, said it plans
to raise as much as $1.26 billion in a U.S. initial public
offering.  The company is offering 30 million shares at $38 to $42
each, according to a statement today. Barclays Plc, Citigroup
Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse Group AG, Jefferies
Group LLC and Wells Fargo & Co. are managing the offering,
Denver-based Antero said.  Antero, founded in 2002 by Chief Executive Officer Paul Rady and President Glen Warren, develops natural gas in the
Appalachian Basin in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. A
group including Warburg Pincus and Yorktown Partners LLC funded
the company in early 2003 and led a $1 billion line-of-equity
financing in 2007.  The shares will be listed on the  New York  Stock Exchange
under the symbol AR. Antero generated $736 million in revenue
last year, up 6.4 percent from 2011, according to a previous
regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
