Natural gas futures declined in New
York for the first time in four days, capping a second quarterly
drop, as meteorologists predicted cooler weather that would
limit demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas slipped 0.8 percent. Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , said temperatures may be mostly normal in
the central U.S. from Oct. 5 through Oct. 9 after warmer-than-usual readings this week. Inventories of the fuel totaled 3.386
trillion cubic feet in the week ended Sept. 20, 0.9 percent
above the five-year average, government data show.  “This is normally the weakest demand period of the year
because temperatures are in a perfect nirvana of not too hot and
not too cold,” said  Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst at
Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “We’re under a little bit of
pressure with ample supplies.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 2.9 cents to settle
at $3.56 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 23 percent below the
100-day average at 2:42 p.m. Prices slid 0.1 percent in the
third quarter and 0.6 percent in September.  The discount of November to December futures narrowed 1.1
cents to 16.9 cents. November gas traded 27.1 cents  below  the
January contract, compared with 28.3 cents on Sept. 30.  Gas Options  November $3.25 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.3 cent higher at 2.2 cents per
million Btu on volume of 960 at 3:11 p.m. Puts accounted for 50
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for November at-the-money options was 29.96 percent at 3 p.m., compared with
29.27 percent on Sept. 27.  Hedge funds’ net-long wagers on four U.S.  natural gas 
contracts fell for the first time in six weeks, dropping by
6,837, or 2.4 percent, to 276,444 futures equivalents, according
to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released Sept. 27.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex  Henry Hub 
Swap Futures, Nymex ClearPort Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and
the ICE Futures U.S. Henry Hub contract. Henry Hub, in Erath,
 Louisiana , is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark
price for the fuel.  The high in Indianapolis on Oct. 6 may be 69 degrees
Fahrenheit (21 Celsius), matching the average for that day, and
the low may be 50 degrees, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
 State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in Columbus,  Ohio , on Oct.
7 may reach 68 degrees, also the normal reading.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
Energy Information Administration data show. The agency is the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Supply Report  Gross gas production in the  lower 48 states  rose 0.7
percent in July to a record 74.52 billion cubic feet a day from
a revised 74 billion in June, the EIA said today in its monthly
EIA-914 report. Output in the “Other States” category, which
includes the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, gained 0.9
percent to 26.37 billion a day as new wells came online.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first six months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, EIA data show.  Gas output will increase next year, driven by production
from the Marcellus and Utica deposits, Vikas Dwivedi, a global
energy strategist at Macquarie Group in Houston, said in a note
to clients today. Industrial demand has declined in recent weeks
compared with a year earlier, Dwivedi said.  “As a result, 2014, in our view, continues to show signs
of fundamental weakness,” he said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
