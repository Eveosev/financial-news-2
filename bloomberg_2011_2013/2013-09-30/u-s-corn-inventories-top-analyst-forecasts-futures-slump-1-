(Corrects to show consumption fell from a year earlier in
third paragraph.)  Domestic corn  inventories  on Sept.
1 were larger than forecast by analysts, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Prices headed for the biggest drop in
more than a week after the report.  Stockpiles in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower, totaled
824 million bushels, down from 989 million (25.1 million metric
tons) a year earlier and up from 661 million estimated earlier
this month, the USDA said today in a  report . Analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey expected 694 million, on average.  About 1.94 billion bushels were consumed in the three
months ended Aug. 31, down from 2.16 billion a year earlier.
Reserves held on farms totaled 275 million bushels, compared
with 314 million a year earlier. Supplies  stored  in commercial
grain silos fell to 549 million bushels from 675 million.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 1.2 percent to
$4.4875 a bushel at 11:17 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
heading for the biggest loss since Sept. 20. Through Sept. 27,
prices tumbled 35 percent this year, the biggest drop among 24
commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  The USDA earlier this month predicted a record harvest of
13.843 billion bushels, 28 percent above last year and up from
13.763 billion forecast in August. The agency will update its
projections for major crops on Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
