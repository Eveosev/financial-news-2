Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3)  rallied on
bets  Brazil ’s state-controlled oil producer will boost fuel
prices soon after a report cited Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas Foster as saying she’s pushing for an increase.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
 rose  1.6 percent to 18.80 reais at 12:08 p.m. in Sao Paulo,
extending its quarterly gain to 16 percent. It was the best
performance today on the Ibovespa gauge, which  fell  1.7 percent.  Petrobras is planning a new price adjustment policy to stem
losses from fuel imports, Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper O Globo
reported yesterday, citing an interview with Foster, who said
that she is working for it to happen “yesterday.”  “Investors are optimistic that the long-awaited increase
is very close,”  Pedro Galdi , the chief analyst at the brokerage
firm SLW Corretora, said in a telephone interview from Sao
Paulo.  Petrobras’ press office didn’t immediately respond to a
phone call and e-mail from Bloomberg News seeking comment. The
company’s price policies are maintained for the moment, Finance
Minister Guido Mantega told reporters today in Sao Paulo.  Petrobras raised fuel prices twice this year. The 9.2
percent weakening of the Brazilian real in 2013 is intensifying
losses from fuel imports sold at a discount by the company to
distributors as part of a policy to keep inflation in check.  To contact the reporter on this story:
