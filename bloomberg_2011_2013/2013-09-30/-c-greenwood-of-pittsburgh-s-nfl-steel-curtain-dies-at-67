L.C. Greenwood, a former  Pro Bowl 
defensive end who won four  Super Bowl  titles in the 1970s as a
member of the Pittsburgh Steelers’ defensive line known as the
“Steel Curtain,” has died. He was 67.  The Steelers didn’t disclose a cause of death yesterday in
a statement.  Greenwood spent his entire National Football League career
with the Steelers from 1969 through 1981, teaming with “Mean
Joe” Greene, Ernie Holmes and Dwight White on a defensive line
that won championships after the 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979
seasons. Greenwood was voted to the NFL’s All-Decade team for
the 1970s.  “L.C. was one of the most beloved Steelers during the most
successful period in team history and he will be missed by the
entire organization,” a joint statement from Steelers Chairman
Dan Rooney and President Art Rooney II said yesterday. “He will
be forever remembered for what he meant to the Steelers both on
and off the field.”  The 6-foot-6 Greenwood was selected in the 10th round of
the 1969 draft out of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, 234 picks after the
Steelers took Greene, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame,
at No. 4 overall.  Greenwood became a powerful pass-rusher, making the Pro
Bowl six times, and had four sacks of Dallas quarterback  Roger
Staubach  in the Steelers’ second Super Bowl victory, a 21-17 win
over the Cowboys following the 1975 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
