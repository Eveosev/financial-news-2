A lawsuit accusing hedge fund
manager Philip A. Falcone and his Harbinger Capital Partners of
misleading investors about the firm’s stake in LightSquared Inc.
was narrowed by a U.S. judge.  U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in  Manhattan  today
dismissed all or part of seven of the nine counts in the
lawsuit. She gave the plaintiffs one more chance to amend the
complaint to address her rulings.  The investors claim Harbinger acquired an interest in
LightSquared, formerly known as SkyTerra Communications Inc.,
without adequately warning them of the risks. Harbinger
ultimately owned 60 percent of LightSquared, which was
developing a high-speed wireless broadband network before it
filed for bankruptcy last year.  The original suit was filed in February 2012 by Lili Schad,
a Wallkill, New York, resident who said she invested $4 million
with Harbinger. Schad, who seeks to represent a class of
Harbinger investors, claimed she wasn’t informed that
LightSquared’s plan to build the network faced obstacles from
U.S. regulators.  Jacob Zamansky, a lawyer representing the Harbinger
investors, said he will amend the claims disallowed by Nathan to
conform to the ruling.  The case is Schad v. Harbinger Capital Partners LLC, 12-CV-1244, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
