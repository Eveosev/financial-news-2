Thai  stocks  dropped, sending the
benchmark index to a three-week low, on concern floods and a
potential U.S. government shutdown will hurt economic growth.  The  SET Index (SET)  sank 2.4 percent to 1,383.16 in Bangkok, the
lowest close since Sept. 6.  Siam Cement Pcl (SCC)  lost 5.3 percent,
the most since October 2001 and the biggest contributor to the
index’s losses.  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP)  slid 4.1
percent after  crude oil  slumped in New York.  Floods have killed 22 people and affected 25 provinces, the
Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said on its
website. Director of the National Disaster Warning Center Somsak
Khaosuwan said the situation was “completely different” from
2011, when the worst floods in 70 years shuttered hundreds of
factories including those of Honda Motor Co. U.S. Congress has
just one day to end a stalemate that raises the risk of the
first government shutdown in 17 years.  There’s concern over the impact of the current flooding on
the economy, Rakpong Chaisuparakul, an investment strategist at
KGI Securities (Thailand) Pcl, said by phone from Bangkok.
“Anxiety over a possible U.S. government shutdown has also
affected stocks in  Thailand .”  Overseas investors sold a net $111.5 million of local
shares on Sept. 27, the fifth straight day of net sales,  data 
compiled by Bloomberg show. The SET has gained 6.9 percent this
month, paring its quarterly decline to 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
