The New York Knicks picked up the
2014-15 option on coach  Mike Woodson ’s contract, allowing him to
avoid lame-duck status a year after guiding the franchise to its
first playoff-series win in 13 seasons.  Steve Mills , appointed the Knicks’ general manager last
week, didn’t reveal financial terms of the option in an e-mailed
statement from the National Basketball Association team.  Woodson led New York to a 54-28 record last season and the
franchise’s first Atlantic Division title since 1993-94. The
Knicks beat the Boston Celtics in the opening round of the
playoffs before losing to the Indiana Pacers.  “I have long respected Mike and think he has done a
remarkable job since becoming the head coach of the Knicks,”
said Mills. “After spending time with him recently, it is clear
that picking up his option is an easy decision.”  Woodson became the Knicks’ coach in March 2012 after the
team fired  Mike D’Antoni , going 18-6 to finish the season. His
.679 winning percentage (72-34) is the second-best in franchise
history, according to the statement.  Pat Riley  is first at .680
(223-105).  To contact the reporters on this story:
