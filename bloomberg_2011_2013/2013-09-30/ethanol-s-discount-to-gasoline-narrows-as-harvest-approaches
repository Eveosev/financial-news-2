Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed for a fourth day as distillers waited for the corn
harvest and gasoline declined with the possible shutdown of the
U.S. government.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 0.15 cent to
67.22 cents a gallon as the government  estimated  that stockpiles
of corn, the primary component in U.S. ethanol, were down 17
percent from a year earlier as of Sept. 1. A Sept. 26 Energy
Information Administration report showed inventories of the
biofuel at the smallest in 12 weeks.  “We’ve got a firmer tone here,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “The pipeline
is still pretty tight. We’re a few weeks away from those tanks
getting filled.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery slipped 4 cents, or
2 percent, to $1.95 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have slumped 11 percent this year. The November contract
fell 2.7 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $1.696.  Gasoline for October delivery decreased 4.15 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.6347 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.
Gasoline slipped with crude as the deadline neared for Congress
to pass a stopgap spending bill.  Stockpiles in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower, totaled
824 million bushels, down from 989 million a year earlier and up
from 661 million estimated earlier this month, the USDA said
today in a report. Analysts in a Bloomberg News survey expected
694 million, on average.  Record Harvest  The USDA earlier this month predicted a record harvest of
13.843 billion bushels, 28 percent above last year and up from
13.763 billion forecast in August. The agency will update its
projections for major crops on Oct. 11. One bushel of corn makes
at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Corn for December delivery fell 12.5 cents, or 2.8 percent,
to $4.415 a bushel in  Chicago . The December corn crush spread of
corn to ethanol was 1 cent, up from minus 1 cent Sept. 27.  Renewable Identification Numbers slipped. The RINs are
tracking certificates attached to each batch of biofuel that can
be traded among refiners and later submitted to the
Environmental Protection Agency.  Corn-based RINs slumped 3 cents to 42 cents, while  advanced
RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, decreased 5 cents to 50 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
