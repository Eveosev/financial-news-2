The biggest expansion in Middle East
crude refining on record is driving rates for vessels hauling
everything from diesel to  jet fuel  toward a six-year high,
boosting profit for  Scorpio Tankers Inc. (STNG)  and  Frontline 2012 Ltd. (FRNT)   The Middle East will this year increase capacity to process
crude by 530,000 barrels a day, or 6.4 percent, the most in data
going back to 1994, says Pareto Securities AS. More cargoes will
diminish the number of idle vessels and daily rates for Long-Range tankers, each hauling 75,000 metric tons, will rise 29
percent to $18,000 in 2014, the average of four analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The expansion means more exports to Europe,  Japan  and
 Australia , voyages that can stretch to 8,400 miles, tie up ships
for longer and reduce available capacity in the fleet of 1,324
vessels. Refineries in  India  and the U.S. are also adding
cargoes. The rate forecasts would make the carriers profitable
for the first time since 2008 after a glut of ships caused a
slump of as much as 93 percent.  “There will be a lot of product available for shipping,”
said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA
in Oslo, whose recommendations on the shares of shipping
companies returned 24 percent in the past year. “It’s all going
to have to go long-haul, so that’s very good for owners.”  Rates Rally  The  Middle East  will process an extra 1.3 million barrels
of crude daily in the next four years, a 17 percent advance that
is equal to about two cargoes a day, according to data from the
 International Energy Agency , the Paris-based adviser to 28 oil-consuming nations. Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and  Total SA (FP)  shipped
the first fuel from a new refinery in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, on
Sept. 23. The plant will handle 400,000 barrels a day.  Middle East nations previously sent more crude to Europe
and other regions for refining. Now they are processing more at
home and exporting higher-value jet fuel, diesel and heating
oil. That’s increasing demand for product tankers at the expense
of crude-oil carriers. Rates on the latter vessels are averaging
the lowest in at least in 16 years.  Tankers carrying refined fuels earned an average of $13,962
a day since the start of January on the industry’s benchmark
route to Japan from Saudi Arabia, 22 percent more than a year
ago, according to data from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the largest
shipbroker. They need about $17,000 to break even, says Carnegie
AS, an investment bank in Oslo. Rates peaked at $76,228 in 2008
and dropped as low as $5,387 in 2010.  Record Shares  Shares of Monaco-based Scorpio, which has 21 tankers
including those being built, rose 37 percent to $9.89 in New
York since the year began. The stock will reach $11.89 in 12
months, the average of 12 analyst forecasts shows. The company
will report profit of $21 million this year, from a loss of
$26.5 million in 2012, according to the mean of six predictions.  Frontline 2012, based in Hamilton,  Bermuda , will say profit
surged to $74.1 million, from $1.4 million, the mean of five
estimates shows. Shares of the company rose 47 percent to 41.20
kroner ($6.85) in Oslo since Jan. 2 and will reach a record
62.45 kroner in 12 months, according to the average of six
forecasts. Frontline 2012 also has ships hauling coal,  iron ore 
and liquefied petroleum gases.  The two companies have the most orders for new tankers,
Clarkson data show. The vessels are the kind most commonly used
for longer-distance deliveries from the Persian Gulf, according
to Eirik Haavaldsen, an analyst at Pareto in Oslo.  Refineries Shift  The prospect of profitable rates is prompting owners to
order new ships, threatening another glut upon delivery in about
18 months. The order book for LR tankers increased to 20 percent
of the existing fleet from 15 percent in December, according to
IHS Maritime, a research company in Coulsdon,  England .  Rates are still below breakeven and have been on an annual
basis since 2008, when the global economy endured its worst
recession since just after World War II. Supply of product
tankers expanded 34 percent in the past five years as trade
gained 17 percent, Clarkson data show.  The economy in  Europe , the biggest source of demand for
fuel tankers, probably stagnated in the three months through
Sept. 30 after contracting in the five preceding quarters,
according to the average of economist estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The data are compiled from forecasts across the
region, including the 17-nation euro area. The continent
accounts for at least 24 percent of seaborne imports, according
to Clarkson.  Europe’s refining industry will contract more quickly than
demand for at least the next five years, according to the IEA.
About 15 refineries processing 1.7 million barrels a day shut
from 2008 to 2012, leaving capacity of 15.1 million barrels. As
a consequence, the region is buying more from the U.S., the
Middle East and India, the IEA said in June.  More Cargoes  More cargoes from the Middle East boost tanker demand
because they mean longer voyages. An average shipment to  France 
from Saudi Arabia is about 6,200 miles. Moving fuels from  Latvia 
to France, a benchmark route for European rates, is 1,300 miles.
Cargoes to Japan from the Persian Gulf travel 6,600 miles.
Shipments to Australia are 8,400 miles. Japanese refining
capacity will decline to 4 million barrels a day by 2018, from
4.6 million barrels a day in 2012, the IEA estimates.  Shipments of refined fuels are also expanding outside the
Middle East, led by cargoes to Latin America from the U.S. Gulf
of  Mexico . Trade on that route will rise 25 percent to 2 million
barrels a day this year, according to Clarkson. America’s
refineries have more oil to process in part because of fracking,
which taps reserves in shale-rock formations. The nation’s crude
output averaged 7.2 million barrels a day since the start of
January, the highest level since 1991.  Maritime Industry  Exports of refined fuels from India rose 5.7 percent to
5.15 million tons a month in the first half, according to data
from the International Trade Centre, an agency of the  United
Nations  and the  World Trade Organization . The country’s Jamnagar
refinery complex is the world’s largest, handling 1.2 million
barrels a day.  Freight rates across the maritime industry measured by the
ClarkSea Index averaged $9,259 a day this year, set for the
lowest annual average since at least 1990, Clarkson data show.
About 90 percent of world trade is hauled by sea, according to
the Round Table of International Shipping Associations.  While refined-product shipments are expanding, the amount
of crude carried at sea is stagnating. Seaborne trade in
unrefined oil will be little changed at 38 million barrels a day
this year, Clarkson data show. The largest crude tankers earned
$7,288 daily in the past nine months, headed for the lowest
annual average since at least 1997.  Million Barrels  Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and
 Iraq , the Middle East members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, shipped an average of 478.2 million barrels
a month in the first half, 7.4 percent less than in 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “For the product-tanker market, it’s tremendously
positive,” said Haavaldsen at Pareto, whose recommendations on
the shares of shipping companies returned 16 percent in the past
year. “There’s some tanker evolution going on. In future you
will see more and more products being transported along the same
routes as crude.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
