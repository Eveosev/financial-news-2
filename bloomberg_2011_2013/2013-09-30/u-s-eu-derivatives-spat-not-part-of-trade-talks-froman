U.S. Trade Representative  Michael Froman  said negotiations with the European Union on derivatives
regulation are taking place outside the context of talks on a
transatlantic free-trade agreement.  EU financial-services chief  Michel Barnier  said on Sept. 13
that the U.S. needs to ease the burden its new rules will place
on European firms. Froman told reporters in Brussels today that
the negotiations involve the European Commission, the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the International
Organization of Securities Commissions.  Froman said the U.S.-EU trade talks would include financial
services in the context of  market access . He declined to give
examples of specific issues that would be in play, and said that
issues like the derivatives rules would be handled “in parallel
and on the side of the negotiations” via two-party and global
discussions.  “There’s a good example where there’s been a lot of
interaction directly between the CFTC, the commission, Iosco and
other authorities, and those issues are getting worked out in
that context,” Froman said when asked if derivatives would play
a role in upcoming free-trade talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
