The U.K.  Green Investment Bank 
invested 11 million pounds ($18 million) in a minority stake in
a facility in Wales that uses waste wood to produce power.  Western Bio-Energy Ltd. will use the money from a GIB fund
to refurbish and improve efficiency at its 14.7-megawatt power
station in Port Talbot, the bank said today in an e-mailed
statement without giving the stake. The plant has been working
since 2008 and produces enough power for more than 28,000 homes.  The fund is managed by Greensphere Capital LLP.  Signia  Wealth Management  and Stobart Plc are co-investors
and the latter will provide feedstock for the life of the plant,
according to the statement. The U.K. Department of Energy and
Climate Change estimates bioenergy plants may meet 8 percent to
11 percent of the nation’s primary energy demand by 2020.  Bioenergy and waste is one of GIB’s investment priorities,
with the bank awarding a mandate to Greensphere to help invest
in small-scale waste-to-energy facilities. This is the fund’s
second investment since it started up in July 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
