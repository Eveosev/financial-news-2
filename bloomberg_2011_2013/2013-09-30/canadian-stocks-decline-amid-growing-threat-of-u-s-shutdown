Canadian  stocks  fell, paring the
best quarterly gain in a year, with all 10 main industries
retreating as a likely U.S. government shutdown tomorrow weighed
on global equities.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  dropped 1.5 percent to pace losses among
energy producers as crude sank to a three-month low. Catamaran
Corp. lost 2.9 percent as health-care stocks fell the most in
the benchmark index. Petrominerales Ltd. soared 50 percent after
agreeing yesterday to sell itself to Pacific Rubiales Energy
Corp. in a deal worth C$935 million.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 58.72
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,785.36 at 10:11 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark Canadian equity gauge has jumped 5.4 percent this
quarter, the biggest gain since September 2012, and is up 2.9
percent in 2013.  The MSCI World Index of developed market stocks sank 0.9
percent, the biggest decline in a month, as equities around the
world retreated. The  S&P 500 Index , the benchmark U.S. gauge,
slid 0.7 percent.  The  U.S. Congress  is scheduled to meet today to attempt to
end a stalemate that raises the risk of the first government
shutdown in 17 years and threatens talks to increase the debt
limit. The U.S. is Canada’s largest trading partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
