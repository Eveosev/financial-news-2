U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline climbed to
a one-month high on the  spot market  as maintenance and upsets at
area refineries threatened to reduce fuel production.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline blendstock, or CBOB, on
the Gulf strengthened 0.5 cent to 12.25 cents a gallon below
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:03 p.m., the
narrowest gap since Aug. 29. Conventional,  87-octane grade  added
0.75 cent to 11.25 cents a gallon below futures.  The discounts narrowed as  Phillips 66 (PSX)  carried out
maintenance at the 239,000-barrel-a-day Lake Charles refinery in
 Louisiana . The  Lake Charles plant  transports fuel by truck,
rail, barge and pipeline to the southeastern and eastern U.S.,
according to the companyâ€™s website.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped 45 cents to $8.84 a barrel, a second
consecutive decline. The same spread based on  Light Louisiana
Sweet oil  slipped $1.10 to $5.74 a barrel, the lowest level in a
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel on the  Gulf Coast  weakened by
0.37 cent to 4.25 cents a gallon below ULSD futures on the
Nymex. The same fuel in New York Harbor was unchanged at 0.13
cent above futures.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in  San Francisco 
strengthened 1.5 cents to a premium of 5 cents a gallon to
futures at 4:06 p.m. New York time.  Carbob in Los Angeles strengthened by 0.75 cent to a
premium of 10.25 cents.  Conventional, 84-octane gasoline  in
 Portland ,  Oregon , weakened by 1 cent to a premium of 8.5 cents.  California-blend diesel in San Francisco strengthened by
1.5 cents to a a discount of 1 cent a gallon to Nymex futures.
The fuel in  Los Angeles  weakened by 0.25 cent to a premium of 1
cent.  Low-sulfur diesel  in Portland was unchanged at a discount
of 2 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
