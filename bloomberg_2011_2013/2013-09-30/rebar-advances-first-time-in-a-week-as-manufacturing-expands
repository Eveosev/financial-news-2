Steel reinforcement-bar futures
rose for the first time in a week as a gauge of manufacturing in
China showed a second consecutive month of expansion.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained as much as 0.6 percent to 3,598  yuan  ($588) a
metric ton and traded 3,587 yuan a ton at 11:04 a.m. local time.
Futures rose 1.5 percent this quarter, the first such climb
since December.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics rose to 50.2 in September from 50.1 in August,
with scores above 50 indicating expansion. China’s markets will
be closed for week-long National Holiday starting tomorrow.  “Demand may increase in the last quarter as the economy is
expected to continue to recover,” analyst Ren Xinlei of Luzheng
Futures said from Jinan. “Traders are netting out their
positions and will wait through the holidays.”  The average  spot  price of rebar fell 0.1 percent to 3,494
yuan on Sept. 27 and has lost 2.9 percent this month, according
to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for
