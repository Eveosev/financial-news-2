A Florida brokerage adviser, Kevin
Dowd, pleaded guilty to  insider trading  for tipping two friends
before  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) ’s $11 billion acquisition of
Pharmasset Inc.  Dowd, 37, who worked at a brokerage in Aventura, Florida,
learned that a Pharmasset director told his supervisors about
the deal, which was announced on Nov. 21, 2011, according to
court papers filed with his guilty plea today in federal court
in Trenton, New Jersey.  Dowd was told not to act on the information yet tipped a
childhood friend, identified as E.F., who made an illicit profit
of $163,621 on Pharmasset shares, according to court papers.
E.F. tipped another friend, E.B., who made $544,706 after buying
Pharmasset call options, according to U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman. In exchange for the tip, Dowd got $35,000, he admitted.  He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit  securities fraud 
and faces as long as five years in prison when he’s sentenced
Jan. 15. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Dowd
in January after his arrest by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.  The number of people sued by the SEC or charged with
insider trading by the  Justice Department  has more than doubled
since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There were
56 in 2008, 96 in 2009, 67 in 2010, 104 in 2011 and 125 in 2012.
Of those, 22 percent were linked to trading involving health-care stocks.  Dowd’s attorney, Peter Willis, didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Dowd, U.S. District Court,
District of  New Jersey  (Trenton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
