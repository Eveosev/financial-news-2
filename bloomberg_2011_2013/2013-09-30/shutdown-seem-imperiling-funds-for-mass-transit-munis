Municipal bonds backed by federal
mass-transit aid are the most vulnerable to a U.S. government
shutdown, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles, known as Garvees, are
sold by states or transit agencies and backed by federal highway
or transportation aid. At least $10 billion of the bonds are
outstanding in the $3.7 trillion muni market, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  While money will continue to flow to pay debt service on
highway Garvees, appropriations for the securities through the
Federal Transit Administration would be affected by a shutdown,
said Nick Samuels, a senior credit officer at Moody’s in  New
York .  The transit debt won’t face missed payments immediately,
Samuels said in a telephone interview today. “But in a very
prolonged shutdown scenario, some of those bonds might need some
type of intervention,” such as using reserve funds or other
state money, he said.  The U.S. government stands poised for its first partial
shutdown in 17 years at midnight tonight, after a weekend with
no signs of negotiations or compromise from Congress or the
White House. Republicans and Democrats in Congress say they
don’t want to close the government, though neither side is
budging from their positions to avoid it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
