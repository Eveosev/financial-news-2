Compal Electronics Inc. (2324) , the world’s
second-biggest contract maker of  notebook computers , offered to
buy full control of its wireless-device production division to
reduce costs.  Compal Electronics will spend as much as NT$16.1 billion
($543 million) acquiring the 52.2 percent of  Compal
Communications Inc. (8078)  that it doesn’t already own, the Taipei-based manufacturer said in a  statement  yesterday. The bid of
NT$50.80 a share represents a 25 percent premium to Compal
Communications’ one-month average stock price, it said in a
separate presentation.  Compal Electronics, which counts Lenovo Group Ltd. among
its customers, is absorbing the unit as a shrinking global
notebook market erodes profitability. The second-quarter gross
profit margin narrowed to 4.1 percent of revenue from 4.5
percent a year earlier, according to an  investor presentation  in
August.  “We’ll be able to provide a one-stop solution to all our
customers” with the integration of the wireless-device business
and the parent company, Compal Electronics President Ray Chen
said on a conference call yesterday. “We expect total
improvement in operating-cost ratio.”  The acquisition, targeted for completion by April 2014,
will be funded by cash reserves and operating cash, Compal
Electronics said. Its stake in Compal Communications, which is
also based in Taipei, is almost 47.8 percent, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
