University of Texas Athletic
Director DeLoss Dodds will announce his retirement tomorrow, the
 Austin American-Statesman  said.  Dodds , 76, will step down on Aug. 31 after 32 years as
athletic director and will remain through 2015 as a consultant,
the newspaper said, citing three sources it didn’t identify.
John Bianco, a spokesman for the athletic department, declined
in an e-mail to confirm the report.  Dodds helped build the athletic department into the richest
in the nation, with a $163 million budget. Texas began the
Longhorn Network, a television station built around its sports
teams, after signing a 20-year, $300 million agreement with ESPN,
and has spent more than $400 million on facility upgrades.  Texas President Bill Powers will lead the search for a
replacement and wants to fill the position by Dec. 1, the
Statesman said. Among the potential candidates is Director of
Women’s Athletics Chris Plonsky.  To contact the reporter on this story:
