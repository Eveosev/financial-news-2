Germany  will need almost twice as
much power reserve capacity to protect supplies in the winter of
2015 to 2016 compared with a year earlier because of the planned
shutdown of an EON SE nuclear reactor.  The nation needs 4,800 megawatts of reserve capacity as the
1,275-megawatt Grafenrheinfeld reactor in southern Germany is
due to close in late 2015 and wind farms are built in the
country’s north, grid regulator Bundesnetzagentur said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Germany, Europe’s biggest power market, is shuttering its
remaining nine nuclear reactors by 2022 and wants to replace
them with a greater share of renewables and modern fossil fuel-fired plants. The shift has led to signs of declining security,
Jochen Homann, the head of Bundesnetzagentur, said earlier this
month.  The nation’s four grid operators, especially Tennet TSO
GmbH and 50Hertz Transmission GmbH, needed to intervene to
stabilize the grids during 7,200 hours last year, compared with
1,800 hours in 2010, he said Sept. 10 at an energy conference in
Munich. The interventions are a result of renewable generation
capacity putting a strain on grids, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
