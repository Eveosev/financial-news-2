Eurostar Group Ltd. will jointly
bid with the Keolis unit of French state train company Societe
Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais for the right to operate
the U.K.’s East Coast link between  London  and Edinburgh.  Keolis will be lead partner for the joint venture trying to
win the rail concession due to be awarded in October 2014, the
companies said in a joint statement. The new franchise would
take effect in February 2015, and the venture would operate
under a new brand, they said.  The U.K. government is reviving bidding for the East Coast
route after a previous contract, awarded to  FirstGroup Plc (FGP) , was
voided because a review found problems with the assessment of
offers, following complaints from Virgin Trains.  “The East Coast franchise is a vital economic artery and a
key route for both business and leisure passengers which
represents an exciting opportunity for future growth and
investment,” Eurostar Chief Executive Officer Nicolas Petrovic
said in the statement.  Keolis already operates three British rail franchises in
partnership with  Go-Ahead Group Plc. (GOG)  It also works with
FirstGroup on the TransPennine Express line, and is bidding to
manage London’s Docklands Light Railway and Crossrail services.  “What’s exciting about the East Coast Mainline is that
there is an opportunity to transform a hugely important national
route, which is yet to see the same levels of investment as the
West Coast Mainline,” said Alistair Gordon, who heads Keolis’s
U.K. operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
