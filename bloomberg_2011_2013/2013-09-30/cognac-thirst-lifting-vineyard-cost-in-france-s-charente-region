Foreign demand for French cognac is
pushing distillers to buy vineyards in a bid to secure grape
supplies, raising prices for wine real estate in the Poitou-Charentes region, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Vineyard prices in Charente’s Grande Champagne area, one of
six zones around the town of Cognac producing white wine for
distilling, rose 13 percent last year to an average 45,000 euros
($60,925) a hectare (2.47 acres), the Paris-based ministry said
in a report. Prices in the Bons Bois zone jumped 39 percent to
25,000 euros a hectare.  France ’s exports of spirits climbed 14 percent to 3.68
billion euros last year, led by demand for cognac, with liquor
accounting for 6.3 percent of the country’s food and farm
shipments in 2012,  trade data  show. Cognac is a  protected
denomination  of origin and must be made from grapes from the
area around the town that gave the brandy its name.  “With a market that continues to grow, the cognac houses
want to secure their eaux-de-vie supply, which is pulling the
price of land and vines up,” the ministry wrote. “Due to
scarcity of supply, quality of the vineyard is no longer a
decisive argument for buyers in the negotiations.”  In Grande Champagne, the most sought-after zone with prices
as high as 58,000 euros a hectare last year, vines younger than
20 years are most in demand, the ministry wrote. Older vines are
finding buyers due to concern about losing market share, with
vineyards ready to be uprooted and replanted still fetching
25,000 euros a hectare, it wrote.  Cognac brands owned by French producers include  Remy
Cointreau SA (RCO) ’s Remy Martin, which has origins dating to 1724,
according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
