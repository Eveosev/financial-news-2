The biggest U.S. banks, including
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , took a larger share
of growing bank deposits in the year ended June 30, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. reported today.  While total deposits jumped 5 percent to $9.4 trillion in
the year, the six banks with the largest deposit totals saw a 9
percent increase, according to annual  data  released today on the
agencyâ€™s website. Those biggest six -- led by  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  with $1.1 trillion -- held 30 percent of deposits.  The growth in deposits has been countered by a recent
decline in the number of bank branches. The number of offices
peaked in 2009 and since the credit crisis has declined each
year, including the loss of almost 1,000 for 2013.  Most deposits -- 60 percent -- are held in national banks,
according to the FDIC. The foreign bank with the most U.S.
deposits was Toronto-Dominion Bank, with $192.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
