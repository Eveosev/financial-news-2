The recent drop in U.S. stocks is a
hiccup relative to the “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” crash.  Grosses for the Broadway spectacle have tumbled by more
than half in two months, dropping in eight of the last nine
weeks, according to figures supplied by the trade association
the Broadway League. In the week ending on Sunday, they fell 13
percent to $622,000. (As of Sept. 30, the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index of stocks was off 2.5 percent from its Sept. 18 record.)  “Spider-Man” sales are down from $1.4 million in the last
week of July, which was the summertime peak. The roughly $75
million show has grappled with cost overruns and accidents
involving performers, among other challenges.  “September has been notoriously bad for all concerned, but
Spidey’s business is about to rebound,” Rick Miramontez, a
production spokesman, wrote in an e-mail.  Some Broadway insiders speculate that “Spider-man” could
swing out of the 1,932-seat Foxwoods Theatre and be replaced by
“ King Kong .” That musical opened in  Melbourne , Australia, in
June and would require a huge house to accommodate its giant
puppet in the title role.  “There is discussion about coming to  North America  but no
plans have been set,” Adrian Bryan-Brown, a spokesman for
“King Kong,” said in an interview. “The specific venue has
certainly not been determined.”  Broadway sales overall were little changed last week, at
$19.4 million.  “Cinderella” fell for the seventh consecutive week, to
$616,000. “Annie” bounced 7 percent from the previous week to
$441,000, ahead of its Jan. 5 close. “First Date,” with
television star Zachary Levi, had its worst week, $307,000.  “ Big Fish ” continued its pre-opening ascent, to $737,000.
(Critics weigh in on Sunday night.) “The Glass Menagerie” rose
21 percent to $511,000, after its reviews included some raves.  Muse highlights include  Greg Evans  and  Craig Seligman  on
