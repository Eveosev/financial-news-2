Buyers of coffee from  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of the robusta variety used in instant
drinks, are paying a higher premium for their beans amid thin
trading and low availability, according to Volcafe Ltd.  Vietnamese beans for shipment in November and December were
last week at a premium of $160 a metric ton to the price on the
NYSE Liffe exchange in London, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based
coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. said in
a report e-mailed on Sept. 27. That’s up from $130 a ton in the
previous 7-day period.  “The physical market up-country is very thin and premiums
are high,” Volcafe said in the report. “Short covering becomes
active once supply avails,” the trader said, referring to the
closing out of bets on lower prices.  Vietnam will enter its 2013-14 coffee season next month and
growers may harvest a record 30 million bags of coffee, Volcafe
estimates. A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).
Robusta coffee futures fell 8.8 percent this month and 7.8
percent this quarter because of a large crop in Vietnam.  “The robusta harvest is still in its very early stages and
seasonal rains make drying difficult,” Volcafe said. Once beans
are harvested, they need to be dried before being sold.  In  Indonesia , the world’s third-biggest robusta grower,
deliveries from farms slowed to 7,000 tons last week, 5,000 tons
less than in the previous 7-day period, Volcafe said. Harvesting
of the 2013-14 crop started in Indonesia in April and Nedcoffee
BV, a trader in Amsterdam, estimated farmers had gathered 92
percent of the crop by Sept. 6.  Indonesian Beans  Indonesian beans for shipment in November and December were
last week at a premium of $130 a ton to the exchange price, down
from a premium of $140 a ton in the previous 7-day period,
Volcafe said.  The flowering season there started in coffee areas and may
provide a “good prospect” for next year’s crop provided
there’s no excessive rainfall, Volcafe said. Flowers become the
cherries that contain the beans to be harvested next year.  Robusta coffee for delivery in November was 0.7 percent
higher at $1,622 a ton by 11:06 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
