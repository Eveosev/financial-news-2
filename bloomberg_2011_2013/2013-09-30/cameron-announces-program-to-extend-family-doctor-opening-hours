U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
announced plans to extend the opening hours of family doctors’
practices to help patients attend appointments without missing
work.  A 50 million-pound ($81 million) fund will be made
available to family doctors, known in Britain as general
practitioners, who want to apply to be among the first group to
open from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. and on weekends. They will also be
encouraged to hold consultations using Skype and by phone.  “Millions of people find it hard to get an appointment to
see their GP at a time that fits in with their work and family
life,” Cameron said in an e-mailed statement. “We want to
support GPs to modernize their services” along with “greater
flexibility, so people can speak to their family doctor on the
phone, send them an e-mail or even speak to them on Skype.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
