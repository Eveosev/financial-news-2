Malaysia’s ringgit fell, leading
losses in  Asia , amid a U.S. budget stalemate that raises the
risk of the first government shutdown in 17 years. Sovereign
bonds were little changed.  The  House of Representatives  voted 231-192 yesterday to
stop many of the Affordable Care Act’s central provisions for
one year, tying it to an extension of government funding through
Dec. 15. Should the Senate reject the bill today, the government
could be shut down from tomorrow. Malaysian bond yields are
likely to rise as inflation accelerates after the authorities
cut fuel subsidies this month, according to a Sept. 27 report
from Barclays Plc analysts led by London-based  Christian Keller .  “It looks like we’re not going to get any agreement
between the two major parties in the U.S.,” said Khoon Goh, a
senior currency strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. in  Singapore . “So the market is now pricing in a
government shutdown from midnight.”  The ringgit declined 1 percent to 3.2606 per dollar as of
10:11 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, the worst performance among Asia’s
11 most-traded currencies, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It gained 0.7 percent in September, trimming its
quarterly loss to 3.1 percent. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, rose 56 basis points today to 10.79 percent.  Fuel Prices  Malaysian  consumer prices  increased 1.9 percent in August
from a year earlier, after rising 2 percent in July, the fastest
pace in 16 months, according to official figures. The government
will announce September data on Oct. 23.  Prime Minister Najib Razak increased the price of the RON
95 grade of gasoline and of diesel by 20 sen each to 2.10
ringgit and 2 ringgit a liter, respectively, on Sept. 3. The
move will help the government save about 1.1 billion ringgit
($337 million) this year and 3.3 billion ringgit annually in the
future by reducing state subsidies, he said.  The yield on the 3.48 percent government notes due March
2023 was steady at 3.77 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate fell 32 basis points in September, the
biggest monthly drop since the notes were issued in March. It
has climbed 14 basis points this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
