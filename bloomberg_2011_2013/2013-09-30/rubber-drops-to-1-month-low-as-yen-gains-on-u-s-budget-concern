Rubber dropped to the lowest level
in more than a month as the Japanese currency climbed against
the dollar, cutting the appeal of yen-denominated futures, amid
concern the U.S. government is headed for a partial shutdown.  The contract for March delivery on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange lost as much as 1.7 percent to 265.6 yen a kilogram
($2,717 a metric ton), the lowest level since Aug. 23, and was
at 267 yen at 10:23 a.m. The drop pared gains for a most-active
contract to 13 percent this quarter, the best rally since the
three months through Dec. 31.  The yen rose to 97.53 per dollar, the highest level since
Aug. 29, as a political stalemate over the U.S. budget prompted
investors to buy the Japanese currency as a haven. The  House of
Representatives  voted 231-192 yesterday to stop many of the
Affordable Care Act’s central provisions for one year, tying it
to an extension of U.S. government funding through Dec. 15.
Should the Senate reject the bill today the government could be
shut down from tomorrow.  “The shutdown could weaken consumption and slow down the
U.S. recovery, which are negative for commodities,” said Takaki
Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.
“A stronger yen is another blow to futures in Tokyo.”  Rubber also declined after data showed today that  Japan ’s
industrial production fell 0.7 percent in August, raising
speculation demand may weaken for the commodity used in tires.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.2 percent to 20,300  yuan  ($3,311) a ton. Chinese
markets will be closed Oct. 1-7.  Thai rubber  free-on-board declined for a third day on Sept.
27, dropping 0.6 percent to 81.05 baht ($2.58) a kilogram,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
