Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) â€™s Eurex
derivatives market plans financial penalties for certain high-speed trading practices, a shift that comes amid German and
European Union attempts to curb computerized transactions.  Eurex, based in  Frankfurt , told members in a  statement  that
on Dec. 1 it will start charging those that submit an unusually
high number of orders in relation to consummated transactions.
High-speed traders often flood markets with bids and offers in
an attempt to find parties to do business with, tasking the
infrastructure of exchanges and brokerages. Eurex also said it
will penalize firms that exceed a daily maximum of transactions.  Germany is moving to implement stricter rules on high-frequency trading ahead of EU rules that will also step up
oversight. Firms that use computers to buy and sell securities
in milliseconds have attracted the attention of regulators since
the May 2010 U.S. stock market plunge known as the flash crash,
which sent the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  to an almost 1,000
point loss in minutes.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has been under pressure
from the opposition  Social Democratic Party  to impose stricter
rules on the finance industry. Her party said today that it will
hold exploratory talks with the Social Democrats this week as
each side dug in for the prospect of months of negotiations to
form a government after the Sept. 22 election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
