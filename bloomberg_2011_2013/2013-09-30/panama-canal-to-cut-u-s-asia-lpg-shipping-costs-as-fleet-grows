The widened Panama Canal will cut
costs to ship U.S. cooking and heating gases to Asia by
shortening voyages, effectively lowering tanker demand just as
yards build more of the ships, according to Joachim Grieg & Co.  The canal expansion scheduled to finish in 2015 will
shorten U.S.-to-Asia voyages for very large gas carriers to 25
days from 42 days going around  Africa , said Steve Engelen, Oslo-based head of research at the shipbroking company whose clients
include Europe’s largest producers. At the same time, yards will
construct the most new vessels since 2008, according to data
from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest shipbroker.  U.S. terminal operators are expanding to take advantage of
record exports of liquefied petroleum gases, a byproduct of
surging domestic oil and natural-gas output. The wider canal
will require fewer ships for shorter voyages, eliminating the
premium for tankers loading in the U.S. even as it stokes trade,
Engelen said.  “LPG globally will become cheaper, which incites more
trade and is always positive for shipping volumes,” Engelen
said. “The amount of ships being delivered is too much even
with the big step up in demand, and the market will get worse
and then basically collapse.”  Yearly Average  Spot rates for VLGCs to Asia from the Middle East jumped 54
percent this year to $62.31 a metric ton and are heading for the
highest annual average since at least 2004, according to the
Baltic Exchange in  London . Rates from the U.S. are more than
three times higher, according to Joachim Grieg. Each ship, 750
feet long and 120 feet wide, can hold about 80,000 cubic meters
(2.8 million cubic feet) of propane or butane.  Construction to double the canal’s capacity is 64 percent
complete, the Panama Canal Authority said on its website Sept.
10. The expanded waterway will be able to handle ships as long
as 1,200 feet and as wide as 160 feet, against the current 965
feet and 106 feet, data on the website show. Seven of the VLGC
fleet’s 154 vessels can use the canal now, according to data
from IHS Maritime, a Coulsdon, England-based research company.  U.S. LPG exports reached a record 10.5 million barrels in
May and are heading for the highest annual total since at least
1981, Energy Department data show. Houston-based  Targa Resources
Partners LP (NGLS)  said last month it would double capacity to load 3
million barrels a month this quarter, increasing to more than 5
million next year.  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  began
operating its expanded Houston facility in March to load 7.5
million barrels a month, up from 4 million. It could reach 10
million barrels a month as soon as 2015, the company said.  A gallon of propane costs about $1.07 in Houston, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Asian imports of LPG rose 5
percent to 19.6 million tons last year, the most since 2000,
data from London-based Clarkson show.  Shipyards have orders to build 23 VLGCs with total capacity
of 1.9 million cubic meters in 2015, according to Clarkson. That
will be the most deliveries since 2008, data show. Not
accounting for demolitions, the new vessels would expand the
fleet by 15 percent to 15 million cubic meters in 2015, the
fastest pace in seven years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
