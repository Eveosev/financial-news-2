Nick Tiller, an energy portfolio
manager at SAC Capital Advisors LP, is retiring from the $14
billion hedge-fund firm run by  Steven A. Cohen .  Tiller, who worked at SAC for almost 12 years and was one
of only a few portfolio managers to oversee $1 billion or more,
plans to focus on  Sustainable America , a charity he founded,
according to an e-mail sent today to colleagues. He also said he
plans to spend more time with his family.  “We thank Nick for his years of hard work at SAC, wish him
well in his retirement and expect that he will make Sustainable
America as successful as he made his 12-year career as a
portfolio manager at SAC,” the firm said in an e-mailed
statement.  “After years of researching and profiting from”
investments in food and energy, Tiller said he will focus on
alleviating shortages in “those same sectors.”  SAC, based in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , was accused by the
U.S. in a July 25 indictment of engaging in an unprecedented
insider-trading scheme lasting more than a decade. The same
month, regulators in an administrative action said Cohen failed
to supervise two senior employees. The firm had about 400
employees focused on investing, according to an April 19 filing
with the SEC.  “Despite extreme scrutiny, we kept working, kept
investing, and kept delivering results through solid fundamental
research and good trading,” Tiller said in his e-mail. He said
he considered retiring last year but stayed at SAC “to help the
firm and my team for another year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
