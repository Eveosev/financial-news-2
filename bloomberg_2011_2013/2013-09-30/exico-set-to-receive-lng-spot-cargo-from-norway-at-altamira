Mexico is set to receive a spot
cargo of liquefied natural gas from  Norway  next week, ship-tracking data show.  The Meridian Spirit, with a capacity of about 163,000 cubic
meters, is scheduled to arrive Oct. 10 at Altamira on Mexico’s
east coast, according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay
on Bloomberg. The tanker loaded the supercooled gas at  Statoil
ASA (STL) ’s Hammerfest LNG terminal in northern Norway and departed
Sept. 25, according to the data.  Mexico doesn’t have term LNG-supply contracts with Norway,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
