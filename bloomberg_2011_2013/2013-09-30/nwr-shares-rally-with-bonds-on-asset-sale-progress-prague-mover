New World Resources Plc (NWR)  shares and
bonds rallied after the unprofitable Czech miner of coking coal
announced a sale of assets designed to shore up its finances.  The stock jumped 9.1 percent to 30 koruna by 10:11 a.m. in
Prague, snapping a 6.6 percent drop last week and extending its
surge in the third quarter to 68 percent. The number of shares
traded was about 95 percent of the three-month average. Yields
on NWR’s euro-denominated notes due January 2021 tumbled 185
basis points, or 1.85 percentage points, to 20.75 percent.  NWR agreed to sell its OKK coking plant, including some
inventories, to Metalimex AS for 95 million euros ($128 million)
by year-end, the Amsterdam-registered company said late on Sept.
27 in a regulatory statement. The deal is subject to approval
from shareholders, regulators and banks. The company reported a
record 315.4 million-euro loss for the second quarter as coal
prices tumbled amid shrinking demand from steelmakers.  “The sale is positive for NWR shares as it will provide
the company with additional liquidity,” Petr Bartek, an analyst
at the Prague-based unit of Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a
report to clients today. “We have also observed positive
changes on the coking-coal market lately.”  The commodity traded at $149.5 a metric ton, up from a low
of $129 reached on July 16, according to the benchmark spot
 prices  for coking coal delivered in  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
