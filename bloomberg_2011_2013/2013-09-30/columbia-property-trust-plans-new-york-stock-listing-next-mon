Columbia Property Trust Inc., the
real estate investment trust with more than $5 billion of
property assets, plans to list shares on the  New York  Stock
Exchange next month.  The stock will trade under the ticker symbol CXP on or
about Oct. 10, Columbia said today in a statement. The company
said it plans to purchase as much as $300 million of the common
shares. It didn’t disclose the pricing of the IPO or how much it
plans to raise.  Columbia, based in Atlanta, changed its name from Wells
Real Estate Investment Trust II Inc. and separated from adviser
Wells Real Estate Funds in March as a step toward listing shares
or liquidating its assets by October 2015, as required under the
company’s charter.  The listing will “increase our shareholders’ total return
potential over the long term by providing access to additional
capital,” Columbia President Chief Executive Officer Nelson Mills said in the statement.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
