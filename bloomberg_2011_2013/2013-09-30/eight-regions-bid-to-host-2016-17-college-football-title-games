New Orleans ,  South Florida  and the
San Francisco Bay area are among eight bidders seeking to stage
the 2016 or 2017 college football national championship games.  AT&T Stadium in Arlington,  Texas , was picked earlier to
host the inaugural title game on Jan. 12, 2015, under the new
four-team playoff format.  Cities or regions bidding for 2016 are  Arizona  (University
of Phoenix Stadium); Jacksonville, Florida (EverBank Field); New
Orleans (Mercedes-Benz Superdome); and Tampa Bay, Florida
(Raymond James Stadium). Bidders for 2017 are the San Francisco
Bay Area (Levi’s Stadium), Minneapolis (Vikings Stadium), San
Antonio (Alamodome), South Florida (Sun Life Stadium),
Jacksonville and Tampa Bay.  “College football is a national sport, and rotating the
game will bring it to more fans where they live,” Bill Hancock,
executive director of the College Football Playoff, said in a
statement.  The 2016-17 sites probably will be selected in November by
the 10 Football Bowl Subdivision conference commissioners and
Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick.  ESPN signed a 12-year contract in November to televise the
playoffs and selected other games for an average $470 million
annually, according to ESPN.com  The inaugural semifinal games will be played Jan. 1, 2015,
at the  Rose Bowl  in Pasadena, California and the Sugar Bowl in
the Superdome.  College football championships draw thousands of out-of-town guests to the host city, where teams, schools and booster
clubs throw parties and drive up local revenue.  Enigma Research Corp., a consulting firm that conducted an
economic impact study for the University of  Alabama ’s 37-21
victory over the University of Texas in the 2010 championship
game at the Rose Bowl, said the game generated $82.4 million for
the local economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
