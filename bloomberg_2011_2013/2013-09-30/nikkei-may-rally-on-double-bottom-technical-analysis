Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average is
on course to surpass its year-high and climb past 16,000, should
it form a “double bottom,” according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  With 25-, 75- and 200-day moving averages all pointing
upward, the Nikkei 225 is testing an intraday high on July 19 of
14,953.29, Shoichiro Yamauchi, an equity-market strategist at
Nomura, said in a telephone interview on Sept. 27. If it
overcomes that level, it’ll form a double bottom with the lows
on June 13 and Aug 28, Yamauchi said. This pattern shows a drop,
a rebound and then another slump approaching the previous low,
usually signaling support.  “I think the market is at a watershed right now and the
Nikkei is moving toward the completion of a double bottom,”
Yamauchi said. “If it does, it may extend gains above 16,000.”  An advance to 16,000 would take the Nikkei 225 to the
highest since December 2007. The gauge closed at 14,455.80
yesterday, capping an 8 percent rally for September and a 5.7
percent advance for the quarter. It has surged 39 percent this
year as of yesterday, making Japanese stocks the best performers
among developed markets.  The equity measure has extended gains after exiting a so-called triangle pattern formed by highs on May 22 and July 18
and lows on June 13 and Aug 28, Yamauchi said. Still, in the
short-term the market may face resistance amid overheating
signs, he said.  Overheating Signs  The Nikkei 225’s 14-day  relative strength index , a gauge of
trading momentum, was at 65 on Sept. 26, near the 70 threshold
that some traders say portends a selloff. The 25-day Toraku
index, which compares the number of stocks that have advanced
with the number that have declined on the broader Topix index,
rose to 122.73 on Sept. 26. A reading above 120 indicates to
some investors a drop is likely.  “The market seems to be overbought in the short term,”
Yamauchi said. “But the correction should be minor because the
overall chart pattern is bullish. Shares are likely to extend
gains thereafter.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
