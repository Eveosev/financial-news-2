Crude oil puts rose when futures
fell as the U.S. government was on the brink of a partial
shutdown because of Congressional budget gridlock.  Implied volatility of puts protecting against a 10 percent
drop in November futures prices on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange rose to 27.76 percent at 4:06 p.m. from 25.09 percent
on Sept. 27. Volatility for calls covering a 10 percent rise in
futures was 22.03 percent, up from 20.29 percent in the prior
session.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading volume
today. The four most active options in electronic trading were
November $90, $95, $100 and $98 puts in that order.  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery fell 54
cents to settle at $102.33 a barrel, the lowest settlement since
July 3.  The current fiscal year expires at midnight and Congress
has been unable to hammer out a spending bill.  November $90 puts were unchanged at 4 cents a barrel with
2,814 lots trading as of 5:03 p.m. November $95 puts climbed 4
cents to 21 cents a barrel on volume of 2,514 contracts.  At-the-money volatility for November options, a measure of
expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, rose to 21.82
percent from 19.95 percent on Sept. 27.  In the previous session, calls accounted for 57 percent of
the 84,620 lots traded.  November $106 calls were the most-active options Sept. 27
with 3,487 contracts changing hands as they lost 11 cents to 71
cents a barrel. December $90 puts, the next-most active, were
unchanged at 35 cents on volume of 3,161 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
41,761 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 41,433 lots
and December $100 calls with 32,731.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
