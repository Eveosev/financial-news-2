Gold futures declined the most in
more than a week as equities and commodities dropped with the
U.S. government poised for its first partial shutdown in 17
years amid a budget dispute.  The MSCI All Country World Index and the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI index of 24  raw materials  slumped as much as 1.1 percent.
Republicans in the  House of Representatives  want to delay
President  Barack Obama ’s Affordable Care Act for a year and make
changes to the health-care law, and Democrats have vowed not to
let that happen.  “Gold is suffering along with other commodities and
equities,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago said in a telephone interview.
“This is general asset liquidation, and people want to be on
the sidelines because of the uncertainty.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.9 percent to
settle at $1,327 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Sept. 20.
Trading was 32 percent below the average in the past 100 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$21.708 an ounce.  Sent Home  The precious metals posted their first quarterly advances
in a year because of increased tensions between the U.S. and
 Syria  and as retail purchases of jewelry, coins and bars rose
after gold touched a 34-month low in late June. Bullion climbed
8.4 percent in the third quarter, and silver added 11 percent.  About 800,000 federal workers will be sent home tomorrow if
the  U.S. Congress  fails to pass a stopgap spending bill before
funding expires tonight.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,412.40 an ounce,
trimming the quarter’s gain to 5.4 percent.  Palladium futures for December delivery slipped 0.6 percent
to $727.15 an ounce. Prices rose 10 percent this quarter, the
