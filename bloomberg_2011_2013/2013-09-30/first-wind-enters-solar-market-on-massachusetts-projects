First Wind Holdings Inc. began
construction on 17 megawatts of solar plants in central
 Massachusetts , the Boston-based wind-farm developer’s first
photovoltaic projects.  The plants comprise a 3-megawatt facility in the town of
Millbury and three sites with a total of 14 megawatts of
capacity in Warren, First Wind said today in a statement.
Borrego Solar Systems Inc. is building the projects and they’re
expected to begin producing power by June.  The company will sell the majority of the output under a
long-term contract to the University of Massachusetts. The towns
of Millbury and Orange have also to buy a smaller portion,
according to the statement.  KeyCorp (KEY)  provided construction and
term facility loans and US Bancorp the tax equity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
