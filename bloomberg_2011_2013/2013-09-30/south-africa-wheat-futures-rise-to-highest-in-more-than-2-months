South African wheat futures climbed
to the highest level in more than two months in Johannesburg
trading.  Wheat for delivery in December, the most active contract,
gained 0.5 percent to 3,440 rand ($342) a metric ton, the
highest since July 5, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange. Yellow corn for delivery in the same month increased
0.2 percent to 2,193 rand a ton while the white variety advanced
0.2 percent to 2,377 rand a ton.  South  Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia , as well
as the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan ,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  The nation is the continent’s largest corn producer. Meal
made from the white variety is one of the nation’s staple foods
and yellow corn is mostly fed to animals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
