Japanese  shares  fell, with the
 Topix (TPX)  index headed for its biggest drop in a month, after the
yen gained against the dollar amid concern the U.S. government
is set for a partial shutdown.  Toyota Motor Corp.,  Asia ’s biggest carmaker, lost 1.9
percent. Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s third-biggest bank
by market value, sank 2.7 percent after being penalized for
transactions with “anti-social” groups. Nippon Yusen K.K.,
Japan’s No. 1 shipping line, dropped 3.1 percent after the
Baltic Dry Index, a measure of commodity shipping rates, dropped
the most in 10 months. Industrial-plant operator Chiyoda Corp.
jumped 2.2 percent after a report it plans to build the world’s
first large-scale plant to produce hydrogen for fuel-cell cars.  The Topix lost 1.7 percent to 1,196.42 as of 9:23 a.m. in
Tokyo, heading for its biggest decline since Aug. 28. All 33
industry groups fell. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average sank 1.9
percent to 14,481.57, with just eight companies rising. The yen
touched a one-month high to the greenback.  “The budget and debt-ceiling impasse has descended into
political posturing,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a senior market
analyst at Monex Securities Inc. “They need to strike some kind
of agreement, but you just don’t know how it’s going to play
out. Investors are concerned a U.S. government shutdown may hurt
the economy, so they’re becoming more risk averse.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.8
percent. The gauge lost 0.4 percent on Sept. 27. The  House of
Representatives  voted 231-192 yesterday to stop many of the
Affordable Care Act’s central provisions for one year, tying it
to an extension of U.S. government funding through Dec. 15.
Should the Senate reject the bill today the government could be
partially shut down from tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
