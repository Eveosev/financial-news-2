All-Star outfielder  Matt Kemp  of
the  Los Angeles Dodgers  will miss the Major League Baseball
playoffs because of a recurring injury to his left ankle, which
kept him on the disabled list for almost two months this year.  Kemp, the runner-up for the National League’s Most Valuable
Player award in 2011, sat out the final two games of the regular
season with soreness in his ankle after returning to the
Dodgers’ lineup Sept. 16.  The Dodgers said tests revealed swelling in the major
weight-bearing bone in Kemp’s ankle and that there was a
possibility it could break if he continued to play. Kemp was on
crutches after yesterday’s final regular-season game.  “I don’t know what to say except the season is over for
me,” Kemp said. “I’ll be a cheerleader on the bench.”  The Dodgers, who won the NL West Division with a 92-70
record, open the playoffs Oct. 3 against the  Atlanta Braves .  Kemp played in 73 games this season, batting .270 with six
home runs, 33 runs batted in and nine stolen bases. He went on
the disabled list July 21 after spraining his ankle and missed
52 games. Kemp played 11 games after returning and had made four
straight starts before experiencing stiffness and soreness in
his ankle, prompting the medical tests.  “I worked really hard, I was doing well and thinking I’d
be OK,” Kemp told reporters. “I was excited two or three days
ago, felt real good at the plate. I got my swing back,
everything I needed to perform. Then they tell me I can’t
perform anymore. It’s tough.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
