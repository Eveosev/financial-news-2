Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  began adding a
new variant of Boeing Co.’s 737 aircraft and a batch of used
Boeing 717s, as the company uses the most diverse fleet in the
U.S. industry to reduce operating costs.  The planes are part of a plan to revamp the second-largest
U.S. airline’s domestic fleet and shave about $300 million a
year from fuel and maintenance spending. The Atlanta-based
carrier this year will add the first 12 of 100 737-900 extended-range models and 16 of 88 smaller 717s it’s leasing from
 Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) , said  Anthony Black , a Delta spokesman.  Chief Executive Officer  Richard Anderson ’s strategy calls
for a mix of fuel-efficient new aircraft and older or used
planes that can be acquired at a lower price. The additions will
replace less cost-efficient 50-seat regional jets being culled
from its U.S. fleet, as well as Boeing 757-200s and DC-9s.  “Straight out of the box, a -900 versus a 25-year-old 757
has ongoing operating-cost benefits for the life of that
airplane,” Nat Pieper, Delta’s vice president of fleet strategy
and transactions, said in a telephone interview. “The gist of
it is as simple as replacing inefficient aircraft with more
efficient jets.”  Delta’s first 737-900ER was handed over to the airline
Sept. 27, Black said yesterday in an e-mail. The initial 717 is
set to arrive later this week. With the addition of those
models, the carrier’s main fleet will have 12 different aircraft
types, including three variants of the 737 and Boeing 767, and
two versions each of the 757, 777 and Airbus SAS A330. The DC-9s
are the oldest aircraft flown by Delta, with an average age of
35 years.  The fleet totaled 727 aircraft as of June 30.  Delivery Snags  The 737-900ERs, ordered in August 2011, are the largest
version of the  Boeing 737 , which is the world’s most widely
flown airliner. Delta will receive 737-900s, which seat 180
passengers, through 2018. The airline expects to begin flying
the planes in commercial service by early November, Pieper said.  Delivery of the first 717 hit several snags, including a
problem with tray tables in emergency-exit rows, during the
final certification process involving the two airlines, vendors
and the  Federal Aviation Administration , Black said. The date
for the 717’s first flight, originally set for Sept. 10, was
delayed twice and now is planned for Nov. 1. Delta was able to
substitute other planes for 717s in earlier flight schedules.  Southwest, AirTran  Southwest, which historically has flown only 737s, decided
to shed the 717s about a year after it acquired them in its 2011
purchase of AirTran Holdings Inc. The Dallas-based carrier
agreed to pay $100 million to convert the planes to Delta’s
standards. The interiors were reconfigured and nine seats
removed to provide a total of 110 in first, economy comfort and
coach classes. Boeing stopped making the 717 in 2006.  “The first AirTran 717 converted to Delta specs received
final FAA certification last week,” Southwest CEO Gary Kelly
said in a message to employees today. “Delivery to Delta is
imminent. I think that will happen this week.”  The delivery schedule for the planes “has fluctuated a bit
as we get the retrofit going,”  Whitney Eichinger , a Southwest
spokeswoman, said of the delay in getting the first 717 to
Delta.  Delta earlier this month bypassed the newest Airbus jets,
instead ordering 40 older, cheaper models to secure lower
purchase prices. The wide-body Airbus A330-300 and single-aisle
A321 have been in production for two decades and are being
supplanted by newer models. It was Delta’s second Airbus order
ever, the last occurring 21 years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
