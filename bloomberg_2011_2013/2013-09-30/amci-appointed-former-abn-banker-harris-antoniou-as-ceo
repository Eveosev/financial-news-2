AMCI Capital LP, a private-equity
investor in coal and metals, appointed as its chief executive
officer a former global head of energy, commodities and
transportation at ABN Amro Group NV.  Harris Antoniou will lead AMCI from its offices in Zug,
 Switzerland , where the company will expand its presence, it said
today in a  statement .  Antoniou left Amsterdam-based ABN in August. The lender
said last month it combined its agriculture, metals and energy
commodities teams into one business.  AMCI, which was established in 1986 by Hans Mende and Fritz Kundrun, has a joint-venture partnership with  Australia â€™s  Aquila
Resources Ltd. (AQA)  to develop the West Pilbara iron-ore project. The
proposed mine is too expensive and difficult to build and AMCI
could sell its stake for $200 million, Credit Suisse Group AG
said in a report earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
