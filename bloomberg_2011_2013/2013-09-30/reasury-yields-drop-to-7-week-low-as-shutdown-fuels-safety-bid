Treasury 10-year note yields fell,
trading at almost a seven-week low, as Congress headed into the
final hours before a midnight deadline for a partial government
shutdown with neither side budging.  The benchmark  yields  pared their decline amid speculation a
shutdown of may be short-lived, and after reports showed
manufacturing gained more than forecast in three U.S. regions.
The yields dropped earlier as more than 800,000 federal
employees faced furloughs, spurring investor demand for safety.
Lawmakers still must tackle the nation’s debt ceiling, the next
fiscal dispute.  “The market popped overnight on the fear trade,” said
 Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in  New York  at Mitsubishi
UFJ Securities USA Inc. “Most of the pop was on the headlines
over the weekend that a shutdown was imminent. We’ve seen this
story before. Who knows what noise is going to come out of
 Washington ? Maybe the market is getting tired of pushing
higher.”  Treasury 10-year note  yields  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.61 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They dropped earlier
to 2.59 percent, the lowest since Aug. 12, before rising to as
high as 2.64 percent. The price of the 2.5 percent security
maturing in August 2023 increased 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 1/32.  ‘Won’t Last’  “There is the assumption that if there’s a government
shutdown, it won’t last for too long,” said Jason Rogan,
managing director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Securities, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. While “the market has priced in what’s going on,” a
prolonged shutdown “might prompt more concern and bring in the
flight-to-quality bid.”  The Bloomberg  U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY)  was little changed
this quarter through Sept. 27. It has gained 0.9 percent this
month and is down 2.4 percent in 2013. The  Bloomberg Global
Developed Sovereign Bond (BGSV)  Index has gained 1.8 percent this month
while losing 3.4 percent in 2013.  Rates on bills that mature Oct. 24 traded at 0.020 percent
today after touching negative 0.010 on Sept. 27. Two years ago,
one-month bills jumped to 0.18 percent on July 29, 2011, the
highest since February 2009, as Congress pushed to the Aug. 2,
2011, deadline set by Treasury to avoid a default.  Three-month (USGG3M)  Treasury bill rates traded at 0.0051 percent
today. They touched negative 0.0101 percent Sept. 27, the lowest
level this year. The 2013 average is 0.048 percent.  Health Law  The Senate rejected the House’s budget-extension plan,
which passed on a nearly party-line vote early yesterday.  House
Republicans  planned another volley that Senate Majority Leader
 Harry Reid  has already rejected. They said they’ll again ask for
changes to the nation’s 2010 health-care law, President  Barack
Obama ’s signature legislative achievement. Republicans insist
the bill include limits on the law, a demand Democrats say they
won’t accept.  “The shutdown is expected to have a dampening effect on
the economy,” driving yields lower,  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a
brokerage for institutional investors, said. The economy “is
fragile enough that the Fed is still pumping in $85 billion a
month.”  The Fed surprised investors on Sept. 18 by refraining from
reducing the amount of its monthly Treasury and mortgage bond
purchases under the quantitative-easing stimulus strategy.  Debt Ceiling  A brief government shutdown won’t lead to any significant
change of the Treasury’s forecast for when the U.S. will breach
the federal-debt limit, a spokeswoman for the department said
yesterday in an e-mail. The Treasury has said measures to avoid
exceeding the debt ceiling will be exhausted on Oct. 17.  The U.S. won’t have enough money to pay all of its bills at
some point between Oct. 22 and Oct. 31 without action by
Congress, according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  Ten-year yields increased from the day’s low after reports
showed manufacturing increased in Chicago,  Dallas  and  Milwaukee .  “The data was stronger than expected,” said  Brian Edmonds , the head of interest-rates trading in New York at
 Cantor Fitzgerald , one of 21 primary dealers that trade directly
with the Fed.  The MNI  Chicago Report (CHPMINDX)  business barometer rose to 55.7 in
September from 53 the prior month. Numbers greater than 50
signal expansion. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast 54.  The  Dallas Fed (DFEDGBA) ’s manufacturing gauge jumped to 12.8, versus
a Bloomberg poll’s projection of 5.5 and a reading in August of
5. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s Milwaukee index rose to
55, versus a forecast of 50 and an August reading of 48.2.  Benchmark 10-year yields are forecast to rise to 2.85
percent by year-end, according to the weighted average estimate
of 74 economists and strategists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Jobs Report  Employers in the U.S. added more jobs in September than the
previous month and the  jobless rate  held at the lowest level
since 2008, economists said before data due Oct. 4. Payrolls
rose by 181,000 workers, the most since April, after a 169,000-job gain the prior month, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The jobless rate was 7.3
percent, economists estimated.  The Labor Department won’t release the employment report if
the government is closed on Oct. 4, according to an Obama
administration official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the
process and requested anonymity. The official couldn’t say how
the report might be affected if the government is shut down and
re-opens before the end of the week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
