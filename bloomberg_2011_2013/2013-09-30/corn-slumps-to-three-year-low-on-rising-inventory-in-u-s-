Corn futures plunged to a three-year low after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  boosted its
inventory estimate by 25 percent. Soybeans dropped the most in
six months as supplies topped analyst estimates by 11 percent.  Stockpiles of corn on Sept. 1 were 824 million bushels, the
USDA said today in a  report . That compared with the agency’s
estimate of 661 million on Sept. 12. Analysts in a  Bloomberg
News  survey last week expected 694 million, on average. Soybean
inventories were 141 million bushels, and a gauge of demand
tumbled 41 percent in the three months ended Aug. 31 from a year
earlier.  Corn has tumbled 37 percent in 2013, the biggest drop among
24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, amid
forecasts for a record crop. Demand for the U.S. grain fell the
most since 1975 in the past year. The nation is the world’s top
grower.  “The market is going to be dealing with big corn supplies
for the next year, and that’s going to limit rallies,”  Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst at AgriVisor LLC in
Bloomington,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview.  Corn futures dropped 2.8 percent to close at $4.415 a
bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Earlier, the
price touched $4.4075, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Sept. 1, 2010.  On Sept. 12, the USDA estimated soybean inventories at 125
million. Last week, 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected 127 million, on average. The U.S. is the top producer.  Harvest Accelerates  “Supplies are a little bigger than people expected,”
Randy Mittelstaedt, the director of research at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Without
a bullish surprise, the market is under pressure with the
harvest coming very quickly. Yields collected so far have been
better than expected, and now we’ll wait to see what happens to
the crops that were planted late because of the flooding.”  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 2.8 percent to
$12.8275 a bushel, the biggest drop since March 28. Earlier, the
oilseed touched $12.80, the lowest since Aug. 19. The price has
dropped 9 percent this year.  The USDA earlier this month predicted a record corn harvest
of 13.843 billion bushels, 28 percent above last year, signaling
lower costs for livestock feed. The agency will update its
projections for crops on Oct. 11.  Cheaper corn is boosting profit for Archer-Daniels-Midland
Co., which makes ethanol from the grain, and Sanderson Farms
Inc., the third-largest U.S. poultry producer.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$6.785 a bushel. The price rose in the previous five sessions,
the longest rally since mid-March. The grain has dropped 13
percent this year.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
