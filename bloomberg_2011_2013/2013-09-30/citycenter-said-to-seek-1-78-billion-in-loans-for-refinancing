CityCenter Holdings LLC is seeking
$1.78 billion in loans to refinance debt, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction.  The joint venture of  MGM Resorts International (MGM)  and Infinity
World Development Corp. with properties on the Las Vegas strip
will host a meeting tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. in  New York  for
potential lenders, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the deal is private. Bank of America Corp. is
arranging the transaction, the person said.  CityCenter has about $1.8 billion of debt, including $1.14
billion in bonds that expire in 2016 and $708 million of
obligations that come due in 2017, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company said last week it would meet with lenders
to discuss a refinancing.  The bank deal may include a $75 million revolving line of
credit due in five years and a $1.7 billion  term loan  that
matures in 2020, the person said. Lenders to the term portion
will receive soft-call protection of 101 cents for six months,
meaning CityCenter would have to pay a one cent premium to
reprice the debt in the first six months.  Clark Dumont, senior vice president of corporate
communications, didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail seeking
comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
