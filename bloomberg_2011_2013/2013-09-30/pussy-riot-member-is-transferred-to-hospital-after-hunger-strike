     Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) --A jailed member of the female
Russian punk group Pussy Riot was transferred to a hospital
after going on hunger strike to protest what her lawyers said
were death threats from a prison official.  Nadezhda Tolokonnikova was moved yesterday from a labor
camp in the Mordovia region about 450 kilometers (280 miles)
southeast of Moscow to a prison medical facility, according to a
website statement by the Federal Prison Service.  Tolokonnikova, 23, was convicted of hooliganism and
inciting religious hatred last August for performing a song
critical of  Vladimir Putin  before last year’s presidential
election inside Moscow’s Christ the Savior cathedral. The case
spurred protests by freedom-of-speech advocates across  Russia 
and abroad. Tolokonnikova is serving a two-year sentence. One
member of the group was freed last October.  The Pussy Riot member should be taken to another
penitentiary, because if something happens to her, “it will be
very unpleasant for the prison administration,” Russia’s human
rights ombudsman, Vladimir Lukin, said in comments published on
the website of the presidential human rights commission.  Tolokonnikova’s defense team has filed a formal complaint
with the regional head of the Investigative Committee, it said
today on its Facebook page.  In an open letter, Tolokonnikova said that she was
threatened by the deputy head of Penal Colony No. 14 after she
complained that inmates are forced to work 17-hour days. The
Federal Prison Service declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
