Sugar swung between gains and
losses after touching a one-week low as investors weighed
reduced output in the main growing region of  Brazil , the world’s
top grower, and a weakening real. Coffee advanced.  Sugar output in Brazil’s center south will be 33.7 million
metric tons in 2013-14, down from a June forecast of 34.2
million tons, the Sao Joaquim da Barra-based miller Usina Alta
Mogiana SA said in a report e-mailed Sept. 27. The real fell 1.9
percent against the dollar last week, the biggest drop for a 7-day period since Aug. 16. A weaker local currency increases the
incentive for exports priced in U.S. dollars.  “Raw sugar is being hit by downward pressure from the
weaker Brazilian real,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in a report e-mailed today.
“The currency of the world’s biggest sugar producer and
exporter depreciated last week at a rate last seen in August.”  Raw sugar for delivery in March gained 0.2 percent to 17.78
cents a pound by 6:35 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . The
price touched 17.61 cents earlier today, the lowest since Sept.
23. Futures trading volumes were about average for the past 100
days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The sweetener has gained 5.1 percent this quarter.
The October contract, which expires today, rose 1.1 percent to
17.06 cents a pound.  White sugar for December delivery slid 0.1 percent to
$478.30 a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  Center South  Raw sugar futures climbed to a five-month high on Sept. 26
on expectations of reduced yields and lower output in Brazil’s
center south. Producers in the area will make 134.1 kilograms
(295.6 pounds) of sugar for every ton of cane crushed, Alta
Mogiana estimated, against June’s 137.5-kilogram projection.  “The rally was mainly attributed to expectations of a
lower output out of Brazil capped by a low ATR and several days
lost to the rain,” Kingsman SA, a Lausanne, Switzerland-based
researcher, said in a report e-mailed today, referring to
sucrose content, or industrial yields.  Global sugar supplies will be 4.66 million tons higher than
demand in the 2013-14 season that starts next month in most
countries, according to Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty., a
Brisbane, Australia-based researcher. That compares with an
August forecast for excess supplies of 3.33 million tons. Rising
output in  Asia  will more than compensate for falling production
in Brazil’s center south, the country’s main growing region, the
researcher said.  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$1.141 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for delivery in
November was 0.6 percent higher at $1,620 a ton in London.  Cocoa for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to $2,635 a
ton on ICE. Cocoa for delivery in the same month slid 0.3
percent to 1,706 pounds ($2,757) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
