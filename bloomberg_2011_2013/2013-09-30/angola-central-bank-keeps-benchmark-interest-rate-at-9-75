The central bank of  Angola ,
Africaâ€™s biggest crude producer after Nigeria, held its
benchmark  interest rate  as inflation was little changed.  The key lending rate was maintained at 9.75 percent, the
Luanda-based Banco Nacional de Angola said in a statement on its
website today. The bank lowered the rate by a quarter of a
percentage point in August for the first time in seven months,
only the second cut since it was introduced in October 2011.  Inflation in August eased to 8.97 percent from 9 percent in
the previous month, the National Statistics Institute said on
Sept. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
