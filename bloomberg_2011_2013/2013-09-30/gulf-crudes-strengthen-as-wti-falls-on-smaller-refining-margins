Light Louisiana Sweet and other
crudes from the  Gulf of Mexico  strengthened relative to West
Texas Intermediate as the U.S. benchmark fell amid weakening
refining margins.  LLS, the benchmark price for light, sweet oil on the  Gulf
Coast , strengthened by 65 cents to a premium of $3.10 a barrel
to WTI at 1:59 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It’s the highest premium has been since Sept. 5.  WTI for November delivery fell as much as 1.8 percent
today, and its discount to European benchmark Brent widened to
as much as $6.47 a barrel, the highest level since Sept. 6. LLS
and other Gulf oils compete with foreign crudes priced against
Brent for space in coastal U.S. refineries.  WTI’s discount to Brent has widened as smaller margins have
prompted U.S. refineries to slow rates. The front-month  3-2-1
crack spread  fell to $11.02 a barrel on Sept. 23 from $41.74 on
Feb. 22.  Midwest refineries  processed 3.49 million barrels of
crude a day the week ending Sept. 20, down from 3.58 million the
week of Aug. 23.  Gulf Coast refineries  ran 8.07 million barrels
a day, down from 8.47 million the previous week.  “Even if margins were not in the red, the fact that they
had come off by nearly 90 percent from their peaks was enough to
deter refineries from running their kit to the fullest,” Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd. in  London , said in
a research note to clients today. “At current crude price
levels and margins, refineries are unlikely to be in a hurry to
raise utilization rates to record highs again.”  Mars Blend, a medium, sour crude, strengthened by 60 cents
to a discount of $1.85 a barrel to WTI. Poseidon’s discount
shrank by 55 cents to $2.70 a barrel. Crude from the Southern
Green Canyon strengthened by 50 cents to a $3-a-barrel discount.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet strengthened by $1 to a premium of
$4.20 a barrel more than WTI. Thunder Horse crude gained $1.15
to a premium of 75 cents a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
