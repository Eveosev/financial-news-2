Argentina , which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a
spot cargo from Nigeria, shipping data show.  The Ben Badis, with a capacity of about 174,000 cubic
meters, is anchored off the coast of  Bahia Blanca  southwest of
 Buenos Aires , according to transmissions captured by IHS
Fairplay on Bloomberg. It was scheduled to dock yesterday. The
vessel loaded the supercooled gas at Nigeria LNG Ltd.’s Bonny
Island terminal and departed Sept. 15, the data show.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s largest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. YPF opened a qualifying process Sept. 26 for potential
sellers in its tender to buy spot cargoes for 2014. Enarsa and
YPF have issued seven spot tenders seeking as many as 150
shipments since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
