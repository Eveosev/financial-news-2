Gasoline slid, capping a second
quarterly decline, as the government was poised for its first
partial shutdown in 17 years, threatening the economic recovery
and fuel demand.  Futures tumbled 13 percent in September, the worst-performing contract in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI commodity
index. The deadline neared for the  U.S. Congress  to pass a
stopgap spending bill before the country’s fiscal year ends at
midnight.  “You’ve got a market that has been up on stimulus and the
expectation that the economy is getting a little bit better and
now the demand side looks questionable,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “When
government is shut down, we obviously take a hit on the gross
domestic product.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 4.15 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.6347 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Trading volume was 19 percent below the 100-day
average at 4:26 p.m. Prices are down 6.3 percent this year and
4.3 percent in the third quarter.  The latest plan from the  House of Representatives  would
authorize 10 weeks of spending only if much of President  Barack
Obama ’s health-care law is delayed for a year, a measure opposed
by the Democrat-controlled Senate.  Concern that a government shutdown would stifle economic
growth sent the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down 0.6 percent to
1,681.55. The  S&P GSCI (SPGSCI)  commodities index dropped 0.6 percent.  Supplies Increase  Gasoline supplies  increased in the week ended Sept. 20 to a
three-year seasonal high, according to Energy Information
Administration data. Refinery utilization, at 90.3 percent, was
was the most for this time of year since 2004.  “Gasoline is leading the market down due to the
significant inventory overhang that we have and the likelihood
refiners continue to operate at higher run rates than last
year,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  The October gasoline and ultra-low-sulfur diesel contracts
expired at the close of floor trading. The more actively traded
November gasoline contract fell 3.2 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$2.6282 a gallon.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 80 cents to $8.05 a barrel, down
from $13.73 on Aug. 30. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent fell $1.08
to $2.01.  Pump Prices  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to $3.399 a
gallon, the lowest level since Jan. 29 and 38.4 cents below a
year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery fell 1.91
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.971 a gallon on trading volume that
was 8.7 percent below the 100-day average. Futures slipped 5.4
percent this month while gaining 3.2 percent in the third
quarter. ULSD is down 2.4 percent this year.  The more actively traded November contract sank 1.33 cents
to $2.9715 a gallon.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI fell 2 cents to $22.47 a
barrel. The  premium  over Brent slipped 30 cents to $16.43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
