Protesters halted oil flow from an
Eni SpA-operated field in western  Libya , reducing supply to the
Mellitah export terminal and threatening operations at four
natural gas-fired power stations, officials said.  Young people unhappy that Libya’s constitution doesn’t
recognize  Amazigh , or the Berber language, as an official tongue
in addition to Arabic, yesterday turned off a pipeline carrying
fuel from the Wafa field to Mellitah, forcing the field to shut
down, Mohamad Al-Ansari, an Oil Ministry media officer, said in
a telephone interview from the capital Tripoli.  “Talks to reopen the field are under way between the oil
ministry and the protesting youth,” he said today.  Wafa provides an average of about 13 million cubic meters a
a day of natural gas, 23,000 barrels a day of natural gas
liquids and 38,000 barrels a day of oil and condensates,
according to the website of Eni’s Libyan unit, Mellitah Oil &
Gas BV. The North African country’s oil production exceeded
700,000 barrels a day, nearly 45 percent of installed capacity,
on higher output from the western region, Oil Ministry
Measurement Director Ibrahim Al Awami said yesterday, before
Wafa was shut down.  The closing of the pipeline threatens gas supply to power
stations in the west of the country, Ruwais, Zawiya, Khoms and
Misratah,  state-run Lana news agency  said.  Protests by workers and guards at energy facilities since
July have reduced production from Libya’s eastern oil fields to
a near halt. The nation produced about 300,000 barrels a day on
average this month, the lowest level since the civil war that
toppled  Muammar Qaddafi  two years ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The country has capacity to pump 1.55
million barrels daily, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
