The ruble pared its strongest month
since September as crude oil fell on speculation the U.S.
government is heading for a shutdown that could reduce demand.  The currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter
declined 0.2 percent to 37.5406 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket by 1:55 p.m. in Moscow, heading for a
1.5 percent gain in the month and a 0.8 percent drop in the
quarter. The yield on government 10-year bonds rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.29 percent, a Sept. 18
high.  Crude,  Russia ’s main export earner, slid 0.7 percent in
 London  to $107.91 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 13. Congress
is scheduled to meet today to end a stalemate that raises the
risk of the first government shutdown in 17 years and threatens
talks to increase the debt limit. An index of 20 emerging-market
currencies compiled by Bloomberg retreated 0.2 percent to 93.51
today.  “Weak oil and currencies of other emerging countries made
the ruble virtually give up more than half of what it has gained
in the beginning of the month,” Vladimir Miklashevsky, trading
desk strategist at Danske Bank S/A in Helsinki, said in e-mailed
comments.  The ruble rallied 5.7 percent against the dollar in the 10
days through Sept. 19, as the the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly
maintained its stimulus program. The currency has weakened 2.7
percent since.  The Russian currency weakened 0.3 percent against the euro
to 43.8665 and slid 0.4 percent to 32.4975 versus the dollar.
The ruble is the fifth worst-performing emerging-market currency
in the last five sessions among 24 tracked by Bloomberg.  Ruble Rollercoaster  “This week we expect a rollercoaster for the ruble, a very
turbulent week,” Miklashevsky said. “Uncertainty” in the U.S.
“affects emerging currencies, including the ruble,” he said.  The ruble has breached the boundary between two
intervention zones in its trading band against the basket,
according to Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist for Russia and CIS
at ING Groep. The central bank has increased its daily purchases
of foreign currency to $200 million per day, he said by e-mail.  The central bank, which reports its currency market
operations with a lag,  bought  the equivalent of 4.35 billion
rubles ($134 million) on September 26, the regulator said on its
website. That brought the total amount spent since May 29 to
more than 559 billion rubles.  The currency sales only have a “psychological impact on
investors,” Polevoy said. “The external background is still a
dominating factor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
