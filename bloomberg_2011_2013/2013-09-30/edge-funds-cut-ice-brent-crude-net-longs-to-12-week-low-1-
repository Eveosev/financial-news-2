Hedge funds and other money
managers cut  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  to the lowest level in
12 weeks, according to ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 167,745 lots in
the week ended Sept. 24, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. The reduction of
19,388 contracts, or 10 percent, curbs net-longs to their lowest
since July 2.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 333,131, a 7.6
percent reduction from a week earlier and the smallest net-short
position since April 30.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as  hedge funds  and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Brent futures slipped 0.4 percent in the week to Sept. 24
to $108.64 a barrel and traded at $107.73 as of 12:24 p.m. local
time on the ICE exchange.  Swaps dealers curtailed net-long positions in Brent by 6.1
percent to 177,817, the lowest level since April 9.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European gasoil fell for a
third week, shrinking 22 percent to 62,336 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
