The fiscal impasse that’s setting
the stage for a partial shutdown of the U.S. government may
plunge the world’s largest economy into recession,  Honeywell
International Inc. (HON)  Chief Executive Officer David Cote said.  “Everyone will get more conservative and pull back on
hiring and investing,” Cote, 61, said today in an interview
with Bloomberg Television’s  Trish Regan . It also would be a
“horrible idea” to block a boost in the $16.7 trillion federal
debt ceiling next month, as some lawmakers vow to do, Cote said.  Cote, who served on President  Barack Obama ’s deficit
commission, spoke as a deadlocked Congress headed toward the
first government shutdown in 17 years. With no funding for
federal operations as the new fiscal year starts tomorrow, some
workers would be furloughed and services ranging from tax audits
to national parks would halt.  A shutdown could reduce fourth-quarter economic growth by
as much as 1.4 percentage points, depending on its duration,
according to economists. The biggest effect would come from the
output lost from idled federal employees.  Cote said it was imperative that Congress act to extend the
government’s borrowing authority by Oct. 17 to avert a default.  “You do not want to create an environment where for the
first time in over 200 years you have creditors looking at it
and going -- ‘Gee, maybe they are not good for the money,’”
Cote said. “When you hear people starting to think that maybe
we should default or not raise the debt ceiling and we will play
chicken with it, are you actually serious?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
