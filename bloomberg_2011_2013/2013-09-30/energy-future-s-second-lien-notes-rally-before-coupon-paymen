Energy Future Holdings Corp.’s
second-lien notes have rallied by the most in four months during
the past three days, signaling that traders expect the
electricity provider headed toward a pre-negotiated bankruptcy
will make a $46 million payment due tomorrow.  The power generator’s $1.23 billion of 15 percent bonds due
in April 2021 have climbed 3.75 cents since Sept. 25 to 22.25
cents on the dollar as of 2:57 p.m. in  New York , according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  The payment “could be a catalyst for the long-awaited
restructuring,” CreditSights Inc. analysts  Andy DeVries  and
 Charles Johnston  wrote in a note dated yesterday. “At this
point, near-term loan and bond prices are being driven by
behind-the-scenes negotiations that we are not privy to.”  Texas’s largest electricity provider, formerly known as TXU
Corp., has struggled since a record 2007 leveraged buyout left
it with more than $40 billion of  debt  in a gamble natural gas
prices would rise. Prices plunged 70 percent from a July 2008
high.  Creditors are working on a prearranged bankruptcy plan
to reduce debt at the company, which was taken private by KKR &
Co., TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners for $48
billion. Lenders turned down an initial proposal advanced by the
company, according to an April 15 regulatory filing. The
electricity provider has to make $270 million of coupon payments
Nov. 1.  Allan Koenig , a spokesman for the Dallas-based company,
declined to comment on the trading levels of the bond.  To contact the reporter on this story:
