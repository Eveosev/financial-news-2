Brazil ’s swap rates rose to a two-week high after the central bank raised its forecast for 2014
inflation, adding to speculation that policy makers will sustain
the pace of increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates due in January 2015 climbed nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 10.23 percent at 10:09 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, the highest level on a closing basis since Sept. 17. They
extended their quarterly increase to 36 basis points. The real
appreciated 0.9 percent to 2.22327 per dollar today, paring its
drop since the end of June to less than 0.1 percent.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini reiterated last
week that policy makers must remain vigilant to prevent the real
from weakening and fueling inflation. The central bank projects
inflation at 5.7 percent in 2014 in the market scenario of its
quarterly inflation report published today, up from the prior
5.2 percent forecast.  “The message from the central bank is that it will keep
raising rates,” Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Banco
Espirito Santo de Investimento in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone
interview. “The increase in the inflation forecast for 2014 was
a surprise. The fact that the central bank took into account a
more depreciated exchange rate changed the inflation dynamics.”  The real has rallied 9.2 percent since Aug. 22, when the
central bank announced a $60 billion program to bolster the
currency and curb inflation. The gain is the biggest among all
of the world’s currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
