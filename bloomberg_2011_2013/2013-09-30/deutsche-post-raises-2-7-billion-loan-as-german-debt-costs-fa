Deutsche Post AG (DPW) , Europe’s largest
postal service, raised a 2 billion-euro ($2.7 billion) credit
line as German borrowers take advantage of falling interest
rates to refinance bank debt.  The five-year revolving facility replaces a loan of the
same size more than two years before maturity “on more
favorable terms,” according to a statement from the Bonn,
Germany-based company. Citigroup Inc., Commerzbank AG, HSBC
Holdings Plc and Deutsche Bank AG helped arrange the debt, which
has two one-year extension options.  German borrowers with investment-grade ratings raised more
than $30 billion of revolving credit facilities, a type of debt
where money repaid can be borrowed again, this year compared
with about $11 billion in all of 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Daimler AG (DAI) ,  Siemens AG (SIE)  and  Evonik
Industries AG (EVK)  are lowering costs as banks compete to lend to the
nation’s most creditworthy firms.  Deutsche Post will pay an interest margin of 30 basis
points, or 0.3 percentage point, more than the euro interbank
offered rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company’s previous loan paid a margin of 55 basis points, the
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
