The U.S. Treasury official who
oversees the Troubled Asset Relief Program called the bailout
program “perhaps the best recent example of effective,
bipartisan government.”  TARP’s greatest legacy may be that “government rose to the
occasion” when faced with “the potential collapse of our
entire financial system,” Tim Massad, the Treasury Department’s
assistant secretary for financial stability, said today in a
speech in  Washington  marking the program’s fifth anniversary.  About $421 billion was disbursed through TARP, and the
Treasury has received $405 billion as of Sept. 27, according to
data on the department’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
