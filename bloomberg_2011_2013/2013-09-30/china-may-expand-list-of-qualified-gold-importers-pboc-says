China , which is on course to become
the biggest gold consumer this year, may allow more companies to
import and export the precious metal under draft rules released
by the central bank yesterday.  Financial institutions, and companies that produce more
than 10 metric tons of gold a year, may be considered, the
People’s Bank of China said on its website.  “The new rule seem to be opening the door to more
participants, though we need to see details on exactly who can
qualify,” said Wang Zhiping, an analyst at Xinhu Futures Co. in
 Shanghai . The trade has so far been limited to nine banks, said
Wang.  China’s gold consumption this year may jump by 29 percent
to reach 1,000 tons, overtaking  India  to become the world’s
largest gold consumer, according to the World Gold Council.
China and India together account for more than half of the
world’s gold demand, according to the council.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: William Bi in
