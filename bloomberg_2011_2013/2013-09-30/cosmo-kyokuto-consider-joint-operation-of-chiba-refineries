Cosmo Oil Co. (5007)  and Kyokuto Petroleum
Industries Ltd. will consider cooperating on the operation of
their Chiba refineries to improve efficiency.  TonenGeneral Sekiyu (5012)  K.K. and Mitsui Oil Co., owners of
Kyokuto Sekiyu, and Cosmo Oil agreed to consider building a
pipeline between their two plants in Chiba prefecture near
Tokyo, the three companies said in a statement today. The trio
may also set up a joint venture to coordinate operations of the
two refineries, they said.  Japanese refiners are under pressure to restructure to
better compete with competitors in  South Korea , China and other
Asian countries. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry,
which oversees Japan’s refining industry, plans to expand
subsidies for Japanese refiners to operate jointly and scrap
inefficient facilities starting next year, it said in August.  “Each refinery has different equipment configuration, and
we have been always thinking that it would work well” if the
two refineries cooperate in operation, Koji Moriyama, the
general manager of Cosmo Oil’s corporate planning department,
told reporters in Tokyo. Details of cooperation have yet to be
decided, Moriyama said.  The three companies plan to report progress on the talks in
the first quarter of next year, Kosuke Kai, TonenGeneral’s
spokesman, told reporters today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
