Americans probably will be paying
the lowest prices for gasoline since January 2011 by Christmas,
with some drivers filling up for less than $3 a gallon.  Prices may drop 25 cents to 30 cents by Dec. 25,  Michael Green , a spokesman in  Washington  for AAA, said in a telephone
interview Sept. 27. The U.S. is heading toward October with the
lowest seasonal  pump prices  since 2010. The average cost for a
gallon of regular gasoline was $3.399 yesterday, the lowest
level since Jan. 29, according to AAA, the nation’s largest
motoring club.  A decline of 30 cents a gallon would save consumers an
average of about $3.36 a week, or $174.72 a year, according to
data from Michael Sivak of the  University of Michigan ’s
Transportation Research Institute. Cheaper gas prices could
bring relief to drivers as the  U.S. economy  recovers from the
worst slump since the 1930s.  “Barring significant disruptions in supply or increased
conflict in the Middle East that drives up oil costs, prices oil
coast, there likely will be a number of states that average less
than $3 a gallon by Christmas,” Green said.  Pump prices have dropped every day this month after crude
and gasoline futures retreated as easing Middle East tensions
reduced concern that oil shipments from the region would be
curtailed. Gasoline for October delivery fell 2.87 cents to
$2.6475 a gallon today on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and
are down 12 percent in September.  Unemployment Rate  Even as the  unemployment rate  declined to 7.3 percent in
August, the lowest level since December 2008, the share of
working-age people in the  labor force , the so-called
participation rate, was the lowest since August 1978, according
to Labor Department data.  The 2013  Atlantic hurricane season , which runs from June 1
to Nov. 30 is shaping up as the first in almost two decades
without a major storm. With the Atlantic full of dry air and
storm-killing winds, there isn’t anything in sight that poses a
threat to the U.S. or to oil and gas production areas in the
Gulf of Mexico.  The absence of major storms in the  Gulf of Mexico  region,
home to 12 percent of U.S. crude production and 45 percent of
refining capacity is located, has allowed U.S. refiners to
operate at the highest seasonal rate in EIA data going back to
1989. Plants processed 16.1 million barrels a day of crude and
other feedstocks in the week ended Sept. 20.  Fuel Economy  The average distance driven by U.S. drivers is 12,492 miles
a year, or about 240 miles per week, and the average fuel
economy of all light-duty vehicles is 21.5 mpg, according to
Sivak, a professor at the research institute.  The last time any state’s average fell below $3 was in
January when eight states went below that amount. The lowest
average in the lower-48 states was $3.093 a gallon in  South
Carolina . The highest average was in  California  where drivers
paid $3.921.  Price declines may slow if crude futures don’t continue
lower, Green said. West Texas Intermediate  crude  for November
delivery dropped $1.52 to $101.35 a barrel today, and have
dropped 5.9 percent this month.  “There’s a floor to how low gas prices can go given that
crude prices are still above $100 a barrel,” Green said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
