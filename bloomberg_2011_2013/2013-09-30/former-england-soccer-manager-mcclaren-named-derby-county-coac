Former England soccer coach Steve McClaren was named manager of second-tier Derby County,
succeeding Nigel Clough who was fired two days ago.  McClaren, who has signed a 2 1/2-year contract, will bring
in Paul Simpson as his first-team coach, Derby said today  on its
website . McClaren, 52, had been an assistant to Harry Redknapp
at division leader Queens Park Rangers since July.  Clough was dismissed after Derby’s third loss in eight
days, a 1-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest, as it dropped to 14th
place in the 24-team Championship. Clough had been in charge of
the Rams since January 2009, making him the division’s longest-serving manager.  He’d followed in the footsteps of his father Brian, who
coached Derby to the English title in 1972.  Former Derby player and assistant coach McClaren quit in
February as manager of FC Twente in the Netherlands, ending his
second stint with the club. He’s also managed at Middlesbrough,
Wolfsburg and Forest.  He was dismissed as England manager in November 2007 after
the nation failed to qualify for Euro 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
