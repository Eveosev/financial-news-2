Osram Licht AG (OSR) , a former unit of
 Siemens AG (SIE) , said a restructuring of its traditional lighting
maintenance business Sylvania Lighting Services in North America
will affect about 900 jobs.  The company will discontinue a “significant part” of its
locations in the U.S. and  Canada  in the next six months as it
focuses on energy-efficient solutions, the Munich-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Our focus is on profitable growth and therefore we are
consequently implementing the company’s transformation agenda,”
Chief Executive Officer  Wolfgang Dehen  said in the statement.  Siemens, Europe’s biggest engineering company, separated
from Osram in July as part of an effort to sell businesses with
low profitability or growth prospects.  Osram has about 39,000 employees globally and generated
revenue of 5.4 billion euros ($7.3 billion) in the 2012 fiscal
year. More than 70 percent of its revenue comes from energy-efficient products, according to today’s statement.  Chief Financial Officer Klaus Patzak said in July that the
lighting producer needs to restructure before considering
additional acquisitions. Osram plans to shut or sell six plants
for a total of 11 divested by the end of 2014 as it targets 1
billion euros in savings by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
