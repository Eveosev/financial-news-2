German retail  sales (GRFRIAMM)  rose in August,
indicating that a recovery in Europe’s largest economy is
gathering pace.  Sales adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings increased
0.5 percent from July, when they fell a revised 0.2 percent, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. Economists
predicted an increase of 0.8 percent, according to the median of
26 estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey . Sales advanced 0.3
percent from a year earlier.  The Bundesbank said last week that Germany’s economy is
being boosted by an “extraordinarily good” consumer climate.
Economic growth of 0.7 percent in the second quarter and a
jobless rate near a two-decade low helped propel Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democrats to win Sept. 22 elections,
setting her up for a third term as leader.  “Germany’s economy is robust even as growth is expected to
slow down a bit in the third quarter,” said Gerd Hassel, an
economist at BHF Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “Risks from the debt
crisis in the euro area remain but if nothing unforeseen
happens, the economy will continue to grow.”  The Bundesbank predicts gross domestic product will
increase 0.3 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2014. The
 unemployment rate  held at 6.8 percent in September, according to
a separate Bloomberg  survey . The Federal Labor Agency is due to
publish the jobless numbers tomorrow at 9:55 a.m. in Nuremberg.  The  European Central Bank  estimates that the 17-nation euro
economy, Germany’s biggest export market, will shrink 0.4
percent this year before growing 1 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
