Ibovespa  futures  fell as lower
commodities prices dimmed the outlook for  Brazil ’s raw materials
exports amid concern the U.S. government is heading for a
shutdown over a budget stalemate.  Oil company  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA  may move
after two people with direct knowledge of the matter said it
plans to miss a $44.5 million payment on dollar bonds scheduled
for tomorrow. Vale SA may be active after data showed
manufacturing increased less than forecast in  China , the iron-ore producer’s biggest export market.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in October declined 1.1
percent to 52,780 at 9:22 a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The benchmark  stock
index  is up 13 percent this quarter. The real climbed 0.2
percent to 2.2471 per dollar.  U.S. lawmakers have to approve emergency legislation by
midnight to keep the federal government operating tomorrow, the
beginning of the 2014 fiscal year. Failure to do so may result
in as many as 800,000 federal employees being placed on
temporary unpaid leave. A shutdown would reduce fourth-quarter
economic growth in Brazil’s second-largest trade partner by as
much as 1.4 percentage points depending on its length, according
to economists.  The Ibovespa entered a bull market Sep. 9 after rising 20
percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 20 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 6.2 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 6.11 billion
reais on Sep. 27, compared with a daily average of 7.71 billion
reais this year through Sept. 24, according to data compiled by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
