Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd., an
online travel service provider controlled by  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , seeks
to raise as much as $125 million in the biggest U.S. initial
public offering by a Chinese company in two years.  Qunar, which runs China’s most popular mobile travel app,
plans to sell American depositary shares and to list on the  New
York  Stock Exchange, according to its filing to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission today. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG are lead underwriters of the deal.  Baidu, operator of China’s largest search engine, paid $306
million in 2011 for a majority stake in Qunar to tap the
country’s growing travel market. Qunar reported sales of $58.5
million for the six months ended June 30 and a net loss of $2.8
million during the period, it said in the filing.  “It looks like they are on the path to break-even just in
sight, and having a powerful parent sponsor is very helpful for
its IPO success,”  Francis Gaskins , president of  Marina Del Rey ,
California-based researcher IPOdesktop.com, which monitors
initial public offerings, said a phone interview. “The market
for Chinese IPOs is a lot healthier than it was two years ago.”  Tudou Holdings Ltd., a video website, raised $174 million
in an  August 2011 U.S. offering . Tudou was acquired in August
2012 by Beijing-based Youku Inc., China’s biggest online video
company.  LightInTheBox Holding Co. (LITB)  a Beijing-based online retailer
that raised $78.9 million in a June IPO, has climbed 25 percent.
 Montage Technology Group Ltd. (MONT)  has returned 42 percent since its
$71 million IPO on Sept. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
