The  World Bank  plans to strengthen
its social safety net to help the 60 percent of people in the
developing world who lack adequate protection from the impact of
global financial volatility and rising food and fuel prices.  Expanding cash transfers, food assistance, public works
programs and fee waivers to help nations respond to crises and
fight persistent poverty will be the center of the agenda for
the World Bank-International Monetary Fund Development Committee
meeting on April 21, the bank said today in  Washington .  “Safety nets can transform people’s lives and provide a
foundation for inclusive growth without busting budgets,” World
Bank President  Robert Zoellick  said in an e-mailed statement.
“Effective safety-net coverage overcomes poverty and promotes
economic opportunity and gender equality by helping people find
jobs, cope with economic shocks, and improve the health,
education, and well-being of their children.”  The World Bank said during the past decade that its
financing for “social protection and labor programs” in 83
countries totaled $11.5 billion.  The “Bolsa Familia” welfare program in  Brazil  and the
Oportunidades program in Mexico, which gives cash to families
who agree to keep their children in school and provide them with
health care, are examples of how well-designed programs can be
cost-effective, the World Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
