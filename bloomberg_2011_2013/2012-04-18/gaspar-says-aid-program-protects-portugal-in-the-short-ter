Portugal ’s Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said international financial support protects his country
in the short term from changes in investor sentiment.  “A country like Portugal that benefits from an
international sponsored program is not at risk from market
forces in the short run because the program itself shelters”
the country,  Gaspar said today at a conference in Washington.  Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho is cutting spending and
increasing taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($102
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
