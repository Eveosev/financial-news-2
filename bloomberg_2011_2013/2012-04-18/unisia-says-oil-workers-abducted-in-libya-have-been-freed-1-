A group of about 80 Tunisian oil
workers abducted in  Libya  have been freed, Tunisian authorities
said today.  The group was taken several days ago near the border with
Tunisia, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A Libyan
armed group released the Tunisians, who were taken in
retaliation for the arrest of three Libyans in Tunisia, the
 Interior Ministry  said in a separate statement.  The Tunisian-Libyan border area has seen an increase in
violence and smuggling in recent months, and the incident
underscored the security woes that prevail in oil-rich Libya
following the civil war that ousted  Muammar Qaddafi  last year.  Libya’s new government has struggled to rein in the armed
militias that are built around regional and tribal loyalties.
The groups were instrumental in toppling Qaddafi from power and
have largely refused to disarm before the central government
provides more funding and services to their respective regions.  Libya’s deputy interior minister, Amr al-Khodrawi, was
quoted by the Libya News Agency late yesterday as denying
reports of the kidnapping.  To contact the reporter on this story:
