Ethanol tumbled for a fourth day as
corn declined and an Energy Department report showed stockpiles
increased.  Prices slipped as corn, the primary feedstock used to make
the biofuel in the U.S., sank and after the Energy Department
said  inventories  swelled 0.9 percent to 22 million barrels, the
first gain since March 16. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to
stretch supply and meet federal mandates.  “The DOE’s came out with a build,” said  Ian Jackson , a
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in  Chicago .  “It was a washout
with corn. Gasoline’s down. It is kind of a flush out
everywhere.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery fell 3.6 cents, or 1.7
percent, to settle at $2.12 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices have dropped 3.8 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol plunged 7 cents, or 3.2
percent, to $2.10 a gallon in Chicago and in the U.S. Gulf the
biofuel slumped 6 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.165, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slipped 5.5 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
$2.195 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive lost 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.28.  Corn futures for July delivery declined 13.25 cents, or 2.2
percent to close at $5.94 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  Gasoline for May delivery fell 3.13 cents, or 1 percent, to
settle at $3.2027 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, which is
mixed with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
