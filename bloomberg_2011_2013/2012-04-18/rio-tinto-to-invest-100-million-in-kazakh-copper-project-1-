Rio Tinto  Group is planning to
invest about $100 million to explore for copper in northern
Kazakhstan as the world’s third-biggest mining company seeks to
reserves of the metal used in electronics and pipes.  Rio Tinto will fully fund the exploration work, which may
start this year, Chris Welton, general manager for exploration
in Central Asia, told reporters today in the capital, Astana.
The company formed a 50-50 venture last year with Tau-Ken
Samruk, a mining unit of Kazakhstan’s wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna,
to tap the country’s mineral resources.  Rio Tinto and Tau-Ken Samruk are close to signing a final
agreement on exploration prospects in the Kostanai region in
northern Kazakhstan, said Aibek Izhanov, the state-controlled
unit’s chief geologist.  If exploration is successful, construction will probably
cost about $700 million to $1 billion, based on the average
capital costs to build a world-class large copper-mine, Welton
said. Tau-Ken Samruk will be expected to fund its share of the
construction costs, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
