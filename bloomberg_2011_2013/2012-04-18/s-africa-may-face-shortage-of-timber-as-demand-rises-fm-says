South Africa â€™s rising demand for
timber in the past six months may lead to shortages and result
in imports for the construction and building industries, the
 Financial Mail  said, citing unidentified people in the timber
industry.  If the pace of demand continues there will be a shortage of
the building material, the Johannesburg-based weekly magazine
cited Pieter van Zyl, chief executive officer of  York Timber
Holdings Ltd. (YRK) , as saying.  The shortage was caused by fires that damaged about 70,000
hectares (173,000 acres) of forestry over the past few years,
said the FM.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha in
