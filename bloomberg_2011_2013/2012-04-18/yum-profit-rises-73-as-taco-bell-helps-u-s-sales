Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) , owner of the KFC
and Pizza Hut restaurant brands, said first-quarter profit rose
73 percent as new menu items at the Taco Bell chain helped U.S.
same-store sales rebound.  Net income climbed to $458 million, or 96 cents a share,
from $264 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier, the Louisville,
Kentucky-based company said today in a statement. Profit
excluding certain items was 76 cents a share. Analysts  projected 
73 cents, the average of 22 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  David Novak  has recently sought to
boost sales at Taco Bell by selling breakfast foods and more
expensive burritos under the “Live Mas” slogan. Sales at Yum’s
stores open at least 12 months rose 5 percent in the U.S., the
most in more than a year.  “They’ve turned around what had been negative earnings
growth in the U.S.,” said Bill Mann, portfolio manager at
Motley Fool Asset Management in Alexandria, Virginia. Yum had
particularly strong same-store sales growth at Taco Bell,
“which has been a laggard for them” in the past, he said.  Yum fell 0.6 percent to $72.48 at 4:49 p.m. in  New York 
after margin deteriorated in China. The shares had  gained  24
percent this year through the close of regular trading today.  Restaurant margin in  China  narrowed to 23.6 percent in the
quarter from 25.1 percent a year earlier, due to rising wage and
commodity costs, Yum said.  China Sales  Same-store sales in China, where Yum has more than 4,600
locations, rose 14 percent, compared with a gain of 21 percent
in the fourth quarter and 13 percent a year ago. Comparable-
store sales are an indicator of growth because they include only
older locations.  The company increased its  forecast  for profit excluding
some items to a gain of at least 12 percent this year to a
minimum of $3.22 a share, compared with a previous forecast for
growth of at least 10 percent. Analysts estimate $3.28, on
average.  “Results are encouraging for breakfast” at Taco Bell,
 Jonathan Blum , a Yum spokesman, said in a telephone interview.
The company will expand its breakfast offerings, including egg
burritos, hash browns and iced coffees, to about 1,000 stores in
the second half of this year, from about 800 now, he said.  Revenue rose 13 percent to $2.74 billion in the quarter
ended March 24, compared with $2.43 billion a year earlier.
Analysts estimated $2.71 billion, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
