Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , a
Chinese solar-module maker, has a “framework agreement” for
$324 million of  China Development Bank  funding for a so-called
trade platform in  Hong Kong  used to import raw materials.  The state-run lender will provide 150 million yuan ($24
million) and $300 million, Yingli said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  The platform will help Yingli reduce foreign-exchange and
financing costs, it said. Yingli bought about 17 percent of raw
materials through Hong Kong in 2011 and the proportion will
probably surge to 40 percent this year, the company said.  China Development Bank has offered at least $47 billion in
credit lines to help China’s solar- and wind-energy companies
since 2010. The support drew complaints from U.S. producers led
by Solarworld AG that have sought duties on Chinese companies
accused of using cheap funds from state lenders to sell solar
panels on Western markets below the cost of production.  “It’s just a framework agreement,” Miao Qing, director of
 investor relations  at Yingli, said in a telephone interview.
“Yingli borrowed little from a $5.6 billion credit-line deal
signed in 2010.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
