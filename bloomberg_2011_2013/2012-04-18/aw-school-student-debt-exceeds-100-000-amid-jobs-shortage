Law school graduates are leaving
college with an average of $100,433 in debt at a time when new
lawyers outnumber legal jobs, according to a  survey  from U.S.
News & World Report.  Graduates of California Western School of Law have an
average of more than $153,000 in loans, the most among law
schools nationwide, according to U.S. News, which surveyed 195
law schools.  This decade, U.S. law schools will produce four times as
many new lawyers as there will be jobs for them, according to
the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . The number of people 
taking the Law School Admission Test, or LSAT, required for 
admission to most law schools, dropped 24 percent over the 
past two years.  Average tuition and fees for private law schools have
jumped 73 percent since 1999 to $35,743 in 2009, an  American Bar
Association  survey shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
