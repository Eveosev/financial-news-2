     April 18 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gaining the most in three weeks, after
 Spain  sold more debt than its target and the  International
Monetary Fund  raised its global economic forecast, boosting the
earnings outlook for Japanese exporters.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets more than 30 percent
of its revenue in  Europe , rose 3.2 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, rose 2.9 percent
on optimism Europe’s debt won’t derail the global recovery.
Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. advanced 5.4 percent after the
Nikkei newspaper reported it plans to commercialize a system
that combines solar power generation with storage batteries.  The Nikkei 225 gained 2.1 percent to 9,667.26 as of the 3
p.m. trading close in Tokyo, rising the most since March 27. The
broader Topix Index added 2 percent to 819.27 with all but one
of its 33 industry groups advancing. Gains accelerated as Bank
of  Japan  Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura said it’s ready for
additional easing if necessary, fueling speculation that further
loosening may be announced at the bank’s April 27 meeting.  “The markets are getting used to Europe’s woes, which are
still negative factors but getting stale,” said Masafumi Oshiden, an investment manager at ING Mutual Funds Management Co.
(Japan) Ltd., which holds about $18.5 billion. “We are seeing a
rally across sectors with big shares leading the way up.”  The benchmark Nikkei 225 has retreated 6 percent since
March 27, when it recouped losses since last year’s natural and
nuclear catastrophes. The gauge has fallen on renewed concern
about Europe’s debt crisis and signs of economic slowdown in
China and the U.S.  IMF Raises Estimate  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.1
percent today. The gauge climbed 1.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday after the IMF raised its 2012 global growth estimate
to 3.5 percent from 3.3 percent and Spanish bonds gained
following an auction. Expectations that Europe’s debt crisis is
stabilizing outweighed data that showed production at U.S.
factories dropped in March for the first time in four months and
builders broke ground on fewer homes than forecast.  “The environment for equities is pretty good,” said
Donald Williams, chief investment officer at Platypus Asset
Management Ltd. in Sydney, which manages about $1 billion.
“Even though 2012 is going to be a tough year because most of
Europe will be in recession for a large part of this calendar
year, you are still looking at a global growth rate of 3.5
percent, which is a pretty decent.”  Makers of electronics and cars contributed about 34 percent
to the Topix’s rally as the yen fell against all of its 16 major
counterparts. A weaker Japanese currency boosts the value of
overseas earnings for companies that do business abroad.  Canon added 3.2 percent to 3,820 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,
 Asia ’s biggest carmaker, advanced 2.8 percent to 3,330 yen.  Banking Stocks Advance  Financial shares also rose as concern about the European
debt crisis receded. Mitsubishi UFJ advanced 2.9 percent to 397
yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-
biggest bank by market value, rose 2.4 percent to 2,693 yen.  Sumitomo Electric Industries advanced 5.4 percent to 1,099
yen. The company will sell a system that combines solar power
with storage batteries, the Nikkei reported. A test facility is
being built in Yokohama, and the company is targeting about 100
billion yen ($1.23 billion) in sales in fiscal 2020.  The Nikkei 225 Volatility Index fell 4.9 percent to 19.59,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.6 percent on the
benchmark equity gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume was
22 percent below the 30-day average.  Shares on the Topix are  valued  at one times book value,
compared with 2.3 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number below one means that investors
can buy companies for less than the value of their assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
