The judge overseeing the trial of
former Democratic presidential candidate  John Edwards  continued
jury selection as the April 23 start-date for the proceeding
approaches.  U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles today also ruled
spectators will not be able to make calls from the courtroom
during the trial.  “Cell phone use is prohibited in the courtroom,” Eagles
wrote in oversized, bold-face letters on an order she placed on
the docket, emphasizing her point.  The process went slowly today. Eagles dismissed one juror
in the morning and five more in the afternoon. Her goal is to
eventually seat 12 jurors and four alternates from an original
pool of 185.  Edwards, 58, a former U.S. senator from North Carolina, is
charged with violating campaign finance rules and using almost
$1 million in contributions to hide an affair. He denies each of
six counts, which carry a maximum prison sentence of five years
each and $250,000 in fines.  Prosecutors allege he solicited money from two wealthy
donors, through a former aide, to hide his relationship with
filmmaker Rielle Hunter. The money allegedly paid for flights,
accommodations and medical and living expenses for Hunter, who
was pregnant with Edwards’s child.  The case is U.S. v. Edwards, 11-00161, U.S. District Court,
Middle District of  North Carolina  (Greensboro).  To contact the reporters on this story:
