Nigeria ’s naira appreciated on
speculation the state oil company will sell dollars to lenders
before an auction by the central bank.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer strengthened
0.2 percent to 157.25 per dollar as of 12:50 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The state oil company Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.,
which runs joint ventures with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , Total SA and Eni SpA to pump more
than 90 percent of the country’s crude oil, periodically sells
dollars to lenders to meet local spending needs. The oil
industry is the second major supplier of foreign exchange to the
market after the  Central Bank of Nigeria , which sells foreign
currency at auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays to stabilize the
naira.  “The state oil company and some other firms are expected
to boost dollar liquidity in the market, which is good for the
naira,” Abubakar Muhammed, chief executive of Lagos-based
Forward Marketing Bureau de Change Ltd., said by phone today.
“Earlier in the week there was a sale by Royal Dutch Shell to
some lenders.”  The central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged
at a record high of 12 percent for a third meeting on March 20.
Inflation rate in the West African country declined to 11.9
percent in February from 12.6 percent a month earlier, according
to the  National Bureau of Statistics .  The yield on Nigeria’s $500 million of dollar bonds due
2021 fell two basis points to 5.430 percent. Borrowing costs of
domestic bonds due 2015 declined 7 basis points to 15.11
percent, according to the April 17 dada on the Financial Markets
Dealers Association  website .  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.8210 per dollar
in Accra, the weakest on record since at least June 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
