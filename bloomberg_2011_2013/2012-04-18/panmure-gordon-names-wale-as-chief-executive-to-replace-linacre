Panmure Gordon & Co., a London-
based stockbroker, said Phillip Wale will succeed Tim Linacre as
chief executive officer.  Wale, 48, was previously CEO of competitor  Seymour Pierce 
Ltd., Panmure said in a statement today. He will take over in
the “summer,” at which point Linacre will become chairman of
investment banking, the company said.  Panmure said in October Linacre would step down, disclosing
at the same time that the company would post a loss for the
second half. London’s stockbrokers were hurt by the European
sovereign debt crisis as market volatility prompted investors to
cut the number of shares they trade and deterred companies from
making acquisitions.  Wale started his career at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where
became co-head of European equities, Panmure said. He also
worked at Commerzbank AG and  Collins Stewart  before joining
Seymour Pierce in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
