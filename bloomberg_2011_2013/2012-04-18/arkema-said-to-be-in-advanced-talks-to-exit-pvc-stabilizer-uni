Arkema SA (AKE) , which exited its vinyls
unit last year, is in advanced talks with potential buyers of a
business making tin stabilizers used in plastic pipes and other
products, two people with knowledge of the situation said.  First round bids have been submitted, said one of the
people, who declined to be identified because the sale process
is private. A deal may be completed as soon as next quarter,
according to the person.  The chemical maker, based in Colombes,  France , already sold
a PVC pipes subsidiary based in its home market and announced
cutbacks at vinyl sites elsewhere in France and in  Spain . The
market has been characterized by high feedstock and energy costs
as well as competition from Asian suppliers.  The tin-stabilizer business generates about 190 million
euros ($248 million) in annual sales and about 18 million euros
in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, one of the people said. Spokesmen for the company
declined to comment.  Reuters reported this week that the tin-stabilizer business
had been earmarked for sale by Arkema, with Valence Group acting
as an adviser on the deal. Valence was formed by the former
chemical deals team at Bear Stearns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
