French railroad operator Reseau
Ferre de  France  sold 100 million euros ($131 million) of 20-year
structured notes that pay returns linked to euro interest-rate
swaps.  The notes pay investors a coupon of the 20-year constant-
maturity swap rate plus 70 basis points with a maximum level of
7 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This rate is
a benchmark that measures the cost of exchanging fixed and
floating interest rates in the swap market.  RFF is the leading issuer of structured notes linked to CMS
rates this year having also sold 200 million euros of securities
in February, Bloomberg data show. The Paris-based corporate
raised 200 million euros of CMS notes in the whole of 2011.  The rail network operator may issue more securities of this
kind if thereâ€™s further demand from investors, said Emmanuel Candalh, head of financial market operations in Paris.  Structured notes linked to swaps allow investors to bet on
the future direction of  interest rates . The securities are bank-
issued notes that combine bonds with derivatives, which are
contracts whose value is linked to the price of stocks, interest
rates, currencies or commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
