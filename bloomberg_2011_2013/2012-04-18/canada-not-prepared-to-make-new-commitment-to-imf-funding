Canada is not prepared to make a
bilateral commitment to increase funding for the  International
Monetary Fund , according to a finance department official.  The Canadian official, speaking to reporters on condition
of anonymity, said Canada welcomes discussion of IMF funding at
this week’s meeting of Group of 20 officials in  Washington .
Separately, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today European
governments need to provide more funding to resolve the debt
crisis in the region.  “Clearly, the Europeans need to step up to the plate much
more than they have,” Flaherty told reporters in Toronto. “We
think that the Europeans, the euro zone countries have not yet
made the contributions they ought to make with their own
resources.”  “The Europeans need to recapitalize their banks, and
that’s not what IMF resources are used for.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
