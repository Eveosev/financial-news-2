The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate and sovereign debt fell, according
to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped
7.5 basis points to 637.5 at 8:45 a.m. in London. The Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade
ratings declined one basis point to 136.5 basis points. A
decrease signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of
15 governments fell one basis point to 278.5.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell 2.5 basis points to 239.5 and the
subordinated index dropped five to 395.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
