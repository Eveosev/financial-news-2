Japan  purchased 4.5 percent of the
debt sold by the European Financial Stability Facility
yesterday, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said.  The nation bought 90 million euros ($118 million) of the
1.99 billion euros in six-month bills, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity because of the ministry’s
policy.  Japan has purchased about 11.5 percent of all EFSF bonds
sold and Finance Minister Jun Azumi said yesterday that the
nation will provide $60 billion for the  International Monetary
Fund  to expand its resources to limit risks from Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
