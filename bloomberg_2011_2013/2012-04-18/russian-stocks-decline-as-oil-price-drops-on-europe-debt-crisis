Russian stocks retreated for a
third day, erasing an earlier advance, as oil dropped on concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis will curb demand.  The  Micex Index (VTBMICX)  of 30 shares lost 0.2 percent to 1,468.55
by the close in Moscow, erasing an earlier 1 percent jump.
Shares of OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel tumbled 2.1 percent. OAO
Sberbank, the nation’s largest lender, declined 0.3 percent. The
Russian Depositary Index of London-traded stocks fell 0.1
percent to 1,728.23, its fourth day of declines.  Urals,  Russia ’s main export oil blend, lost 0.2 percent to
$114.60 a barrel. European stocks declined as Spanish banks
reported the highest share of non-performing loans in total
lending since 1994 and falling home prices signaled slowing
growth in China.  “Renewed European worries, in particular in  Spain , are
drawing most attention from investors,” Michael Kart, managing
partner at Spectrum Partners Ltd., said by e-mail. “With
softening oil and lack of new inflows to Russian funds, this
adds additional pressure on stocks.”  Russia-focused equity funds had their first outflows in 11
weeks in the seven days to April 11, according to EPFR Global
data.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell 0.6 percent to $29.70 in  New York .
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
index futures, added 0.4 percent to 31.99 points.  Magnitogorsk dropped to 12.646 rubles, its lowest close
this year after the steelmaker posted its first annual loss
since at least 2002 amid falling metal prices. OAO Severstal,
Russia’s second-biggest steelmaker, advanced 0.8 percent to
380.60 rubles, its first increase since April 9.  Cheap Stocks  The MSCI Russia gauge of equities listed in Moscow,  London 
and New York has lost about six percentage points more than the
MSCI All-Country World index during the past month. Stocks
around the world have retreated since the middle of March as
 China  posted the slowest economic growth in almost three years
and investors speculated that Spain may become the fourth euro-
area nation to need a bailout.  The  International Monetary Fund  increased its 2012 global
growth forecast to 3.5 percent from 3.3 percent yesterday and
said oil will advance 10 percent this year, helping send the
Micex as much as 1 percent higher in earlier trading today.  Crude and natural gas account for about 50 percent of
Russian government revenue.  The 5.4 price-earnings ratio on the MSCI Russia index is 44
percent below its 9.1 average over the past decade, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has the lowest multiple
among benchmark indexes in 21 emerging countries tracked by MSCI
and Bloomberg, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
