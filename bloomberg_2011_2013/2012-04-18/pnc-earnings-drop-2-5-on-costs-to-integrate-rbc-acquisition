PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) 
climbed in  New York  trading after raising its 2012 revenue
forecast and reporting profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  PNC advanced 1.3 percent to $64.24 at 10:22 a.m., the
third-best performance on the 81-company Standard & Poor’s 500
Financial  Index (S5FINL) , behind Huntington Bancshares Inc. and Citigroup
Inc.  Revenue percentage gains this year will be in the “high
single digits,” Chief Financial Officer Richard Johnson said on
a conference call with analysts after earnings were released.
First-quarter per-share profit was $1.62 excluding $145 million
in costs from the acquisition of RBC Bank USA, beating the $1.48
average estimate of 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The earnings report was a “solid beat” and the improved
revenue outlook should help the shares, said  Andrew Marquardt ,
head of bank research at  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  in New York.  Johnson said in January that the bank expected $170 million
of integration costs in the quarter. The bank’s updated revenue
growth estimate, as well as the expectation that net interest
income will have “high-single digit” percentage growth this
year, is a boost from January. The bank said then that the
percent increases would be in the “mid- to high-single
digits.”  PNC paid about $3.47 billion for RBC Bank and related
credit-card assets, a transaction that was completed last month.
The purchase is expected to add 40 cents to earnings per share
for the full year, excluding integration costs, Johnson said.  ‘Tremendous Opportunities’  “We feel even better about this transaction now,” Chief
Executive Officer Jim Rohr, 63, said on the call. “This
acquisition is off to a great start and we see tremendous
opportunities to grow in these markets.”  First-quarter net income fell to $811 million, or $1.44 a
share, from $832 million, or $1.57, a year earlier, the
Pittsburgh-based bank said in a statement.  PNC expects to hire at least 200 people for its Southeast
operations and could add between 10 and 30 branches in the
region as a result of the RBC acquisition, Rohr said.  First-quarter  revenue  rose 2.8 percent to $3.73 billion
from last year as income from PNC’s residential mortgage
business gained 18 percent to $230 million. The housing business
is “doing a little better” in some markets, Rohr said on the
call. Non-interest expenses increased 19 percent to $2.46
billion.  PNC set aside 56 percent less for soured loans in the first
quarter as the bank’s provision for credit losses fell to $185
million. Net charge-offs were $333 million in the period,
compared with $533 million a year earlier. PNC is focusing on
managing its credit costs and expenses, Rohr said in January.  Commercial Loans  Total loans grew to $164.6 billion as of March 31 from
$150.1 billion at the same time last year as PNC recorded a 23
percent increase in commercial loans, which rose to $69.3
billion from $56.3 billion.  First-quarter results included $38 million, or 5 cents per
share, of residential mortgage foreclosure costs, according to
the statement. Rohr said he expects those charges to continue.  PNC’s  net interest margin , the difference between what the
bank pays to borrow money and what it gets for loans, narrowed
to 3.9 percent from 3.94 percent last year and widened from 3.86
percent in the fourth quarter. U.S. lenders are facing a squeeze
on profits as record-low  interest rates  put pressure on net
interest margins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
