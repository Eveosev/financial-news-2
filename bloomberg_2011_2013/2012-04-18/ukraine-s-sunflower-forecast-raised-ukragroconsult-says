Ukraine will plant 5.7 million
hectares (14 million acres) of sunflowers for the 2012 harvest,
or 8.6 percent more than last year, according to agricultural
researcher UkrAgroConsult  That’s more than the government’s estimate of 4.5 million
hectares and exceeds UkrAgroConsult’s February forecast of 5.3
million hectares, the Kiev-based researcher said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  Sunflower yields are seen at 1.68 tons per hectare,
compared with 1.78 tons per hectare in 2011, due to low soil
moisture levels, it said.  The country’s rapeseed crop will fall 32 percent to 959,000
tons from last year’s 1.42 million tons, the researcher said.
The winter crop, which was hit by a drought in the autumn, will
account for 835,000 tons, according to the statement.  The soybean harvest will rise 7.8 percent to 2.46 million
tons this year, after a 14 percent increase in planting areas to
1.32 million hectares, UkrAgroConsult said. Yields may fall to
1.86 tons per hectare from 2.04 tons per hectare, the researcher
said, without giving a reason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
