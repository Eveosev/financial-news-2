Abraaj Capital Ltd., the  Middle
East ’s biggest buyout firm, is in talks about three investments
in  Saudi Arabia  worth up to $150 million each, a senior official
said today.  “We are looking at three transactions at the moment,”
Ahmed Badreldin, senior partner at Abraaj Capital said on the
sidelines of a conference in Dubai. “The equity contribution in
each of the deals is between $100 and $150 million each.”
Abraaj is seeking to close one of the deals in the next three to
four months, he said.  Abraaj, which prefers to hold majority stakes in its
portfolio companies, is also looking at a possible deal in sub-
Saharan Africa which would involve $100 million of equity,
Badreldin said. The company may also dispose of two investments
this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
