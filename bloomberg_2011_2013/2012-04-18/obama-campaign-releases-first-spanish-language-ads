President  Barack Obama ’s campaign
released its first Spanish-language advertisements for radio and
television as it reaches out to Hispanic voters who may help
decide the November election.  The ads, to air in Colorado, Nevada and Florida, tout
Obama’s record on education, including his support for Head
Start early education programs and the increase in funding his
administration has sought for  Pell Grants  for higher education,
according to a campaign press release today.  Obama’s campaign is preparing for close contest against
Republican  Mitt Romney , and is emphasizing its policies directed
toward Hispanics, who gave Obama 67 percent of their  votes  in
2008. To court the voting bloc, Obama’s campaign has developed a
Spanish-language website and is recruiting Spanish-speaking
volunteers by using Spanish-language voter registration forms
and phone banks.  Today, the campaign will begin “Latinos for Obama,” a
nationwide effort to urge Hispanics to register, volunteer and
ultimately to vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
