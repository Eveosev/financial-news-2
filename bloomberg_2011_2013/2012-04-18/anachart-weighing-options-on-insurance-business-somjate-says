Thanachart Bank Pcl (TCAP) , a unit of
Thailand’s Thanachart Capital Pcl, is still considering options
for the sale of its insurance businesses, President and Chief
Executive Officer Somjate Moosirilert said.  The bank, partly owned by  Canada ’s  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , is
in talks with a number of investors, Somjate told reporters in
Bangkok today. It’s still deciding whether to keep, sell or find
partners for its insurance businesses, he said.  Thanachart Bank has three insurance units -- Thanachart
Insurance Co., Thanachart Life Assurance Co. and Siam City Life
Assurance Co., which it acquired during the merger with Siam
City Bank Pcl.  The lender hired Citigroup to sell its insurance businesses
for about $500 million, Reuters reported on March 16, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
