Hong Kong   stocks  rose, driving the
benchmark index to a two-week high, as the  International
Monetary Fund  raised global economic forecasts and Spain sold
more debt than targeted, boosting the outlook for exporters.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that counts Europe as its
biggest market, advanced 5.3 percent. Cnooc Ltd.,  China ’s
largest offshore oil producer, climbed 3.3 percent after crude
futures advanced. CSR Corp. gained 5.7 percent after the Xinhua
News Agency said China’s largest train maker will supply high-
speed trains to Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway.  “The environment for equities is pretty good,” said
Donald Williams, chief investment officer at Platypus Asset
“Even though 2012 is going to be a tough year because most of
Europe will be in recession for a large part of this calendar
year, you are still looking at a global growth rate of 3.5
percent, which is a pretty decent growth rate.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 1.1 percent to 20,780.73 at the
close in Hong Kong, with almost five shares rising for each that
fell. Volume on the measure was 9.2 percent lower than the 30-
day intraday average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
advanced 1 percent to 10,896.89.  Hong Kong’s equity benchmark has climbed 12 percent this
year through yesterday as signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering
fueled confidence among exporters. The rally boosted the  value 
of stocks on the gauge to 10.5 times. That compares with 13.3
times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 10.8 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.1 percent today. The gauge
advanced 1.6 percent in  New York  yesterday after the IMF raised
its 2012 global growth estimate to 3.5 percent from 3.3 percent.
Shares also rose as Spain sold 3.18 billion euros of bills
($4.18 billion), compared with a maximum target of 3 billion
euros the Treasury set for the sale.  Exporters Climb  Exporters advanced. Esprit jumped 5.3 percent to HK$16.78.
Man Wah Holdings Ltd., a sofa maker that depends on the U.S. for
more than half of its sales, climbed 3.9 percent to HK$4.26.  Energy and resources companies paced gains among the 11
industry groups on the  Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI)  after crude and
copper futures rose. Cnooc climbed 3.3 percent to HK$16.08.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal,
increased 2.6 percent to HK$18.76.  CSR advanced 5.7 percent to HK$5.92 after Xinhua reported
the company will supply more than $200 million worth of high-
speed trains for a line connecting Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong
Kong, which is scheduled to open in 2015.  Developers Decline  Among shares that fell, Guangzhou R&F Properties Co Ltd.
dropped 2.5 percent to HK$9.85 after a report showed  home prices 
declined in 37 of 70 cities in the mainland last month.  Greentown China Holdings Ltd. slid 1.8 percent to HK$5.50.
China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., the biggest Chinese
developer listed in Hong Kong, lost 0.1 percent to HK$16,
trimming a decline of as much as 1.5 percent.  Declines among real estate companies were limited on
speculation that falling property prices will allow more room to
ease monetary policy, according to Toshio Sumitani, a strategist
at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index expiring this month rose 1.1
percent to 20,769. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  slipped 5.1 percent
to 20.24, indicating options traders expect a swing of about 5.8
percent in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
