BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
asset manager, reported higher first-quarter profit as rising
markets more than made up for client redemptions and a
continuing shift to lower-fee passive products.  Net income at the New York-based firm rose 0.7 percent to
$572 million, or $3.14 a share. Rising markets and foreign-
exchange swings lifted assets to $3.68 trillion. BlackRock fell
the most in four months as customers removed a net $48 billion
in the quarter.  Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink has been urging
clients to invest in equities as markets have rallied. BlackRock
has started a new advertising campaign aimed at making it better
known and is seeking to increase higher-fee assets as investors
have turned away from actively-managed funds in recent years.
The firm’s share of fees from active funds has fallen as
investors moved money into BlackRock’s iShares ETFs.  “We saw renewed confidence in global markets driven by
European stability following the  European Central Bank ’s
announced liquidity plan together with positive economic data in
the U.S., leading investors to seek out macro exposures
primarily through index products,” Fink said in today’s
statement.  BlackRock fell as much as 3.9 percent, the most since Dec.
8, and declined 2.7 percent to $196.32 at 10:18 a.m. in  New
York . Before today, the  shares  gained 4.4 percent in the 12
months through April 17, compared with the 8.3 percent decline
in the 20-member S&P index of asset managers and custody banks.  ETFs Gain  BlackRock drew $18.2 billion into its iShares ETFs in the
quarter, compared with deposits of $1.1 billion into active bond
funds and redemptions of $4.5 billion from active stock funds.  BlackRock’s net withdrawals were driven by a $36 billion
redemption from a single institutional fixed-income client.
Excluding that previously-disclosed redemption and withdrawals
from cash funds, BlackRock said clients added $25.7 billion
during the quarter.  Money managers such as BlackRock, which earn fees based on
the assets that they manage for clients, traditionally benefit
from rising stock markets and investor deposits into higher-fee
stock and bond funds. The  MSCI ACWI Index (MXWD)  of global stocks rose
11 percent in the first quarter and the U.S. benchmark Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index rose 12 percent.  ‘New World’  BlackRock’s assets rose about 1 percent to $3.68 trillion
from a year earlier and increased 4.9 percent compared with the
prior quarter. BlackRock’s investment advisory fees fell about
0.4 percent compared with a year earlier.  Investors put an estimated $73 billion into active funds
industrywide this year through March, while depositing $34
billion into passive funds, according to data compiled by
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  in  Chicago . U.S. exchange-traded products had
their best ever start to a year, attracting new assets of $55.6
billion in the first three months of 2011, according to data
compiled by BlackRock.  BlackRock in February started a “new world” campaign to
tell clients how to invest in an uncertain market. Four-page
inserts appeared in publications including the Wall Street
Journal and the Financial Times as part of the branding
initiative. Fink and other BlackRock executives have spoken
publicly about how investors can be harmed by staying in cash-
like products and focusing on short-term investing.  BlackRock’s Acquisitions  The firm, which acquired  Barclays Global Investors  in
December 2009, offers actively managed stock and bond funds,
passive strategies,  hedge funds  and portfolios that use
mathematical models, giving it the broadest array of products
among money managers.  Fink, who co-founded BlackRock in 1988, has built the firm
through a series of acquisitions, including the 2006 purchase of
Merrill Lynch & Co.’s investment unit. BlackRock acquired the
hedge fund-of-funds business of Quellos Group LLC in 2008. The
company last year expanded the alternatives division, which
manages hedge funds, real estate funds and private-equity
strategies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
