The yuan declined after the central
bank set a weaker  reference rate  for the currency following data
yesterday showing foreign-direct investment contracted for a
fifth month.  Investment fell 6.1 percent in March from a year earlier to
$11.8 billion, compared with a 0.9 percent decline the previous
month, the ministry of commerce reported. The People’s Bank of
China set the daily  fixing  0.08 percent lower at 6.2948 per
dollar, even after the  International Monetary Fund  raised its
forecast for global growth and regional equities advanced.  “I’m quite surprised to see a weaker fixing today despite
the stronger markets across  Asia ,” said Stella Lee, president
of Success Futures & Foreign Exchange Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “China
may want to show a wider band doesn’t mean more room for one-way
appreciation bets. Investors are concerned about the magnitude
of  China ’s economic slowdown as investment keeps falling.”  The yuan declined 0.02 percent to close at 6.3028 per
dollar in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It fell as much as 0.12 percent earlier. One-month
implied volatility for the yuan, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, dropped 28 basis points, or 0.28
percentage point, to 2.2 percent.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan weakened 0.07
percent to 6.3035. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards traded
at 6.3440, little changed from yesterday’s 6.3455, a 0.6 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate.  London Yuan Trade  The Washington-based IMF said the global economy will grow
3.5 percent this year, up from a January projection of 3.3
percent, and 4.1 percent in 2013. The fund forecast China will
expand 8.2 percent in 2012 compared with 8.1 percent previously.  The yuan is allowed to trade 1 percent either side of the
daily fixing after the central bank increased the band from 0.5
percent this week. The move doesn’t necessarily signal a shift
to a new exchange-rate framework and the band remains
“narrow,”  Fitch Ratings  said yesterday.  Research company Bourse Consult said in a report today that
 London  is seeking to become a hub for yuan trade and investment
in an initiative backed by Bank of China Ltd., Barclays Plc,
Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc.  Institutions in the U.K. capital currently have more than
109 billion yuan ($17.3 billion) of customer and interbank
deposits in the Chinese currency and that total is “growing
strongly,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
