Pacific Investment Management Co.
continues to buy  government bonds  from Spain and Italy, co-Chief
Investment Officer  Mohamed A. El-Erian  told Germany’s  Die Zeit .  “We buy and hold -- with caution -- Italian and Spanish
bonds,” El-Erian was quoted by the daily newspaper as saying.
“It is important to distinguish between individual countries:
Spain isn’t insolvent. Italy isn’t insolvent.”  If the Spanish government can convince investors that it is
making progress in cleaning up its banking sector, the country
won’t need a bailout, El-Erian said, according to Die Zeit.  He also said Europe should enter into a transfer union, in
which the region’s northern states subsidize southern states to
facilitate needed fiscal reform, Die Zeit reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
