Daimler AG (DAI)  will start building
trucks at a new factory in southern India beginning in the third
quarter as the German company looks to challenge  Tata Motors
Ltd. (TTMT)  in the fast-growing market.  The manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz vehicles will introduce
17 models ranging from six tons to 49 tons by 2014, according to
Daimler statements released in Chennai today. The factory will
initially have a capacity to make 36,000 trucks a year and raise
it to 72,000 units, the company said.  Daimler, which is spending 44 billion rupees ($853 million)
in the country, plans to have 70 dealer locations by the end of
this year to win customers as India builds more roads and boosts
trade. The Stuttgart-based company will join  Navistar
International Corp. (NAV)  and  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  to try and dent the dominance
of Tata Motors.  “If Daimler can match Tata on price and beat them on
reliability, then they will do very well in India,” said
 Deepesh Rathore , the New Delhi-based managing director of IHS
Automotive in India. “Trucking in India is changing slowly to
the hub-and-spoke model and as that happens, customers will
increasingly look at safer and more comfortable trucks.”  Tata Motors, which makes trucks ranging from 0.5 tons to 49
tons, had a 58 percent share of India’s 809,532-unit truck and
bus market in the year ended March 31, according to data from
the  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers .  Denting Edge  Sales of Tata Motors’s heavy and medium trucks grew 8.7
percent in the year ended March 31, compared with the
industrywide increase of 8.8 percent, the trade group’s data
show. The company has five truck factories and sells through
1,173 outlets.  Daimler will expand the number of dealers to more than 100
by 2014, it said in the statement. The trucks to be sold in the
country will have 85 percent local content, it said.  “We are optimally positioning ourselves for one of the
world’s strongest and fastest growing truck market,” Chief
Executive Officer  Dieter Zetsche  said in the statement.  Truckmakers are counting on India to award construction of
8,800 kilometers (5,468 miles) of highways in the next 12 months
to boost vehicle demand.  Asia ’s third-biggest economy could
increase spending on roads, which carry about 65 percent of the
nation’s cargo, to $145 billion in the five years to 2017 from
about $69.8 billion in the previous period, according to a
PricewaterhouseCoopers study.  The newer roads come as the country seeks to boost exports
to $500 billion by 2014 from more than $300 billion in the year
ended March 31, which could further bolster cargo traffic.  Sales of medium and heavy trucks are projected to almost
double to 500,000 vehicles by 2020 from 270,000 last year,
according to IHS.  Emerging Markets  Daimler, which is also the world’s third-largest maker of
luxury cars, aims to increase truck sales in markets such as
 China , India and  Russia  to drive growth. The company said in
February it’s targeting sales of 700,000 trucks by 2020 from
426,000 last year.  Daimler, which also makes Freightliner trucks in the U.S.
and Fuso models in Asia, is rolling out commercial vehicles
tailored for the demands of  emerging markets . Daimler received
final approval from China’s government in December to make
trucks in the country under the Auman brand. Its trucks in India
will be sold under the new BharatBenz badge.  The truck business contributed 25 percent of Daimler’s
revenue in 2011, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The German truckmaker originally formed a venture with New
Delhi-based Hero Group to run the Chennai facility. It took
control of the operations in 2009 after Hero pulled out.  Daimler’s history with Tata goes back decades. In 1954, the
German automaker signed an agreement with Tata to assemble
medium-duty Mercedes-Benz trucks for sale in  India . In March
2010, Daimler sold a 5.3 percent stake in Tata Motors, which
controls the Daimler brand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
