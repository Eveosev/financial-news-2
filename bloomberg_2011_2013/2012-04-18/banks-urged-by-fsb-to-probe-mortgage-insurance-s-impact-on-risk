Banks should carry out “prudent
and independent” assessments of the protection offered by
mortgage insurance policies to avoid making irresponsible loans,
the Financial Stability Board said today in a statement on its
website.  Mortgage insurance, which gives holders protection if they
can’t make payments on their home loans, “should not be
considered as an alternative” to due diligence by a bank into
whether borrowers will be able to meet their obligations, the
FSB said. Mortgage insurers should also be subject to oversight
by regulators, it said.  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., once the world’s fourth
biggest investment bank, fell victim in 2008 to a credit crunch
driven by concerns over whether so-called sub-prime borrowers
would be able to honor their mortgages. The bank’s failure
sparked the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression.  The FSB, which brings together financial ministry
officials, central bankers, and regulators from the Group of 20
nations, made the recommendation as part of a set of guidelines
on responsible mortgage lending.  While national regulators are free to “consider imposing”
limits on the size of mortgage a bank can offer in relation to
the value of the property, such curbs may not be needed if banks
follow “sufficiently prudent” lending policies, the FSB said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
