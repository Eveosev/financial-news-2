Lawmakers in  Sierra Leone  have
approved a $30.6 million grant from the  International
Development Association , a World Bank unit that provides
interest-free credit for poor nations.  The grant will help develop the capacity of local councils
to deliver services to their residents, Frank Kposowa, a
lawmaker, said today in a phone interview from the capital,
Freetown. IDA, as the World Bank unit is known, provided $20
million for the initial phase of the project in 2009, he said.  Sierra Leone is one of the worldâ€™s 10 poorest countries,
according to the United Nations Human Development Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
