U.K. stocks  retreated for the first
time in three days as minutes from the  Bank of England  showed
policy maker  Adam Posen  ended his support for more stimulus to
drive the economy.  Banks declined as bad loans surged in  Spain .  Man Group Plc (EMG) ,
 Tesco Plc (TSCO)  and  CRH Plc (CRH)  paced the selloff, all falling more than 2
percent.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  and Severn Trent Plc led advancing shares
on the FTSE 100 Index.  Borders & Southern Petroleum Plc (BOR)  jumped
by a record.  The FTSE 100 slipped 21.66, or 0.4 percent to 5,745.29 at
the close in London after gaining 2 percent over the previous
two days. Stocks rallied yesterday after Spain sold more debt
than it had targeted at an auction and the  International
Monetary Fund  boosted its growth outlook for the world economy.
The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  fell 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index rose 0.1 percent.  “The minutes were less dovish than the previous one,”
Mauro Giorgio Marrano, an economist at UniCredit SpA, wrote in a
report. This suggests “the monetary-policy committee is likely
to remain on hold on the stock of asset purchases at its May
meeting.”  Minutes from the April 4-5 Bank of England meeting showed
Posen ended his push for further stimulus, joining the majority
of the nine-member MPC in seeking no change to the 325 billion-
pound ($521 billion)  asset-purchase target .  While officials noted the U.K. may face a recession in the
first half of this year, they said inflation might pose more of
a danger than they had predicted.  Banks Decline  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  declined 3.1 percent to
24.43 pence,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  dropped 2.9 percent to 214.25 pence
and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  lost 3.2 percent to 29.97 pence.  U.K. banks fell as data showed that non-performing loans
for Spanish banks as a proportion of total lending jumped to
8.16 percent in February, the highest level since 1994. That
compared with less than 1 percent in 2007, according to the Bank
of Spain. The total credit in the economy that the regulator
lists as “doubtful” reached 143.8 billion euros ($189
billion).  Man Group Plc, the world’s largest publicly traded hedge
fund manager, dropped 7.4 percent to 99.6 pence, its lowest
price since 2000, as assets at its flagship AHL Diversified fund
slipped last week.  Citigroup Inc. yesterday cut its earnings per share for the
the company by 15 percent in 2012 and 43 percent in 2013, citing
“lower performance fee and negative re-balancing forecasts.”
Analysts said the shares were “fair value, but sentiment risk
is high.” The stock has  tumbled 21 percent  so far this year.  Tesco Shares Slip  Tesco declined 2.2 percent to 321.05 pence after earlier
rallying as much as 2.3 percent.  Britain’s largest retailer 
posted a 1.3 percent increase in annual profit to 3.76 billion
pounds, in line with analyst estimates, and said it will invest
1 billion pounds to revive ailing U.K. stores.  “Like for like in stores with the new service trials are
only 1 percent better than the chain, and a continued focus on
price is not what is required,” wrote Jonathan Pritchard, an
analyst at Oriel Securities, in a report to clients. “The U.S.
won’t break even until later than expected, so more here for the
bears than bulls.”  CRH, the world’s second-biggest building-materials maker,
dropped 2.4 percent to 1,249 pence in  London , after climbing 3.7
percent yesterday. European Union data today showed the region’s
 construction output  dropped for a third month in February, led
by declines in Germany and  Italy .  Fresnillo, Severn Trent  Fresnillo gained 3.2 percent to 1,624 pence after the
precious metal producer reported that first-quarter gold
production climbed 26 percent to 121,792 ounces. The company
said it made “good progress” in its exploration program at San
Julian, Orisyvo and Centauro Deep.  Severn Trent Plc increased 3.1 percent to 1,656 pence as
analysts recommended the shares. Credit Suisse Group AG named
the utility the most preferred regulated long stock among U.K.
long-only funds as its balance sheet and dividend is under the
least pressure.  Borders & Southern surged 55 percent to 108 pence, the
biggest rally since the shares first started trading in May
2005, amid speculation that the energy explorer active off the
Falkland Islands has discovered oil. The company said March 16
that it expected another four or five weeks of activity on its
Darwin well, a period that expires this week.  “It’s the market expecting a result from Borders,” said
Tracey Mackenzie, an analyst at broker Brewin Dolphin Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “There’s obviously some speculation and people are
taking a bet. They’re chasing large prospects, and if they’re
commercially viable, this could run a lot further on the back of
successful results.”  Falkland Oil & Gas Ltd. (FOGL)  jumped 35 percent to 93 pence, its
largest gain since July 2007, and  Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH) 
gained 6.6 percent to 377.5 pence.  Ten members of the  FTSE 100, (UKX)  including  Legal & General
Group Plc (LGEN) ,  Smith & Nephew Plc (SN/) , and  BAE Systems Plc (BA/) , are trading
without the right to the latest dividend payment today, wiping
5.3 points off the  index , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
