Bulgaria’s wheat harvest will fall
about 20 percent this year to 3.3 million to 3.5 million metric
tons, following adverse weather, according to Kiev, Ukraine-
based UkrAgroConsult.  The southeast European country still will be able to export
grain even after wheat losses, the researcher said yesterday in
an e-mailed statement. Adverse weather damaged about 30 percent
of the country’s winter wheat crop, UkrAgroConsult said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
