Frontier Mining Ltd. (FML) , owner of a
copper project in  Kazakhstan , rose the most in three months in
London trading after saying it began mining operations.  Frontier gained as much as 17 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Jan. 19. It has stockpiled about 25,000 metric tons
of copper ore at the Benkala project in northwest Kazakhstan,
the company said in a statement today.  “Mining operations have now commenced with mining
occurring on an on-going daily basis at a rate of 1,500 tons per
day of ore, which will ramp up to 8,000 tons per day as normal
operations are established,” the company said.  Frontier, seeking to produce 3,500 tons to 5,000 tons of
copper this year, will begin output at the mine in June, it
said. It plans annual production of 20,000 tons in 2014, Chief
Executive Officer Erlan Sagadiev said in an interview in March.  It rose 0.8 pence to 5.45 pence by 12:20 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
