     April 18 (Bloomberg) --  Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d. 
dropped the most in four months in Ljubljana trading after
Slovenia’s second-biggest bank said its 2011 loss was bigger
than earlier reported.  The shares slumped 7 percent to close at 3.30 euros, the
most since Dec. 15, after dropping as much as 8.5 percent in
earlier trading. The Maribor-based bank said yesterday its 2011
loss was 81 million euros ($106 million), compared with the 53.6
million euros reported on March 1, as bad loan provisions
surged.  “The drop is no surprise and with such a loss the outlook
for the stock isn’t good,” Radivoj Pregelj, an analyst at
Abanka Vipa d.d. said over the phone today. “What’s surprising
is such a big difference in earnings after the revision.”  Nova Kreditna, which started a dual listing in Warsaw about
a year ago, is struggling with surging bad loans from the 2009
recession in Slovenia that was among the hardest hit in the 17-
member euro region.  Lenders in Slovenia, including Nova Kreditna’s bigger rival
Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., will probably incur further losses
as the economy enters another  recession , the jobless rate rises
and the government embarks on austerity measures, the central
bank said last month.  -- Editors: Tim Farrand, Peter Woodifield  To contact the reporter on this story:
