Farmers of robusta coffee in the
main producing state in  Brazil , the second-biggest grower of the
variety, have started harvesting this year’s crop, according to
Cepea, a University of Sao Paulo research group.  Farmers in Espirito Santo state began picking the 2012-13
crop this month and harvesting will be under way on most farms
by the end of April, beginning of May, Margarete Boteon, an
analyst at Cepea, said in a report yesterday.  “Producers from Espirito Santo are focused on drying
coffee beans,” Boteon said. “Only a few producers have coffee
beans of the new crop to trade and for immediate delivery.”  The harvest in Rondonia state, Brazil’s second-biggest
producing area, began in February, according to Cepea. Field
works there are advancing at “a good pace,” the group wrote in
the report, citing its own survey of agents involved in coffee
producing and trading.  Brazil’s robusta coffee production will rise to 16.5
million bags in 2012-13 from 14.3 million bags in 2011-12, Terra
Forte Exportacao e Importacao de Cafe Ltda., the country’s
second-largest exporter, estimated in February. A bag of coffee
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Robusta coffee for July delivery was down 0.2 percent to
$2,010 a metric ton by 9:26 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
