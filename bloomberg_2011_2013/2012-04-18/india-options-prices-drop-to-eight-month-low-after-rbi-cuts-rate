Options (SENSEX)  to protect against losses
in Indian stocks fell to an eight-month low after the nation’s
central bank reduced borrowing costs for the first time since
2009 yesterday to revive economic growth.  India VIX, a gauge of options prices in the S&P CNX Nifty
Index, sank 3.3 percent to 19.6 as of 9:57 a.m. in Mumbai, the
lowest level since Aug. 3, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
Nifty gauge rose 0.9 percent to 5,338.25, extending yesterday’s
1.2 percent advance.  “The rate cut is a big positive for sentiment and has led
to a sharp fall in volatility,” Sunil Jain, derivatives analyst
at Quant Broking Pvt. in Mumbai, said by e-mail today.  The  Reserve Bank of India  cut the repurchase rate by 0.5
percentage points to 8 percent yesterday, exceeding the 25
basis-point median estimate of 25 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Gross domestic product may expand 7.3 percent in the
year through March 2013, compared with the baseline projection
of 7 percent for the previous 12 months, the bank forecast.  Asia ’s third-largest economy grew at the slowest pace in
three years in the fourth quarter after the RBI raised rates by
a record 13 times from March 2010 and October last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
