Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC) , the
country’s biggest telecommunications company,  advanced  to the
highest price in two weeks in Lisbon after  Oi SA (OIBR4)  approved an
8 billion-reais ($4.3 billion) dividend payout through 2015.  The shares  climbed  0.2 percent to 3.778 euros, the highest
since April 5, at the close of trading after rising 2.8 percent
earlier in the day. Portugal Telecom holds a stake of about
15.6 percent in Oi,  Brazil ’s third-biggest phone company by
market value.  “The move is related to Oi’s announcement that it will pay
a good dividend,” said Joao Queiroz, a trader at Go Bulling in
Lisbon. “The stock is also recovering from recent lows.”  Oi said yesterday it expects net sales to rise 5 percent to
28.9 billion reais this year and to climb to 38.6 billion reais
by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
