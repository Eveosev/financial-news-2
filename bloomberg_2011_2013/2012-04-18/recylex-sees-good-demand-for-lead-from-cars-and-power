Recylex SA (RX) ,  a Paris-based metals
recycling company, sees “relatively good” demand for lead in
 Europe  due to its use in car batteries and emergency power
generators, said Yves Roche, the chief executive officer.  “Demand in Europe is good,” Roche said in an interview at
a Metal Bulletin conference in Warsaw yesterday. “It’s not
booming, but nearly everything is sold already.”  While lead usage in western Europe is more driven by
industrial batteries, such as those used in emergency power
generators, customers in eastern Europe have been buying more
metal for car batteries, he said.  Lead output at Recylex’s two smelters in Germany and
 Belgium  was 126,000 metric tons in 2011. Recylex, which makes
most lead from used batteries, sells almost all its metal in
Europe. The  company  processes about 150,000 tons of battery
scrap a year, Roche said. About 80 percent of lead is used in
batteries, according to the International Lead and Zinc Study
Group in Lisbon.  About 45 percent of world lead usage comes from replacement
 car batteries , an area largely immune to recession, Roche said.
Lead accounted for 70 percent of the company’s revenue in 2010,
according to its website. Glencore International AG, the world’s
largest commodity trader, owns about a third of the French
company, Bloomberg data shows.
