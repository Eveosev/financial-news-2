Thailand ’s baht advanced toward its
strongest level in two weeks on speculation the supply of
dollars is increasing as overseas insurance companies honor
claims related to last year’s floods.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares snapped a two-day
drop after demand for  Spain ’s 12-month bills increased at an
auction yesterday, easing concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will
worsen. The baht has strengthened 0.2 percent this month after
 exports  rose 0.9 percent in February from a year earlier,
halting three months of declines.  “There is continued speculation of flood-related insurance
inflows and exporter demand, which provide support for the local
currency,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian
and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
 Tokyo . “Asian currencies got a boost as the pessimistic mood in
the market regarding Europe’s situation was corrected a bit.”  The baht appreciated 0.1 percent to 30.78 per dollar as of
8:35 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 30.72 in offshore trading on April 13, the strongest
level since March 28. Local financial markets were closed on
April 13 and April 16 for public holidays.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.52
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
