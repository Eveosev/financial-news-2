Dubai’s direct foreign trade with
 Iran  reached 36 billion dirhams ($9.8 billion) last year,
boosted by an increase in the price of gold, a much-traded
commodity between the two neighbors.  Imports and exports stood at 5 billion dirhams while re-
exports were 31 billion dirhams, with most-traded items
including food, clothing, rugs, cars, diamonds and jewelry as
well as gold,  Dubai Customs  said in an e-mailed statement today.
It did not give comparative numbers for the previous year.  “Dubai is like a hypermarket for Iran,” Ahmed Butti Ahmed,
executive chairman and director general at Dubai Customs, told
reporters in Dubai today. In the  United Arab Emirates , 80
percent of non-oil trade is channeled through Dubai, the  Middle
East ’s business and tourism hub, he said.  Iranians are suffering from the U.S. drive to isolate the
Islamic republic’s $480 billion economy through sanctions aimed
at curbing  Iran’s nuclear program  by targeting trade, banking
and oil exports. Some imports have disappeared from the shelves
and others have soared in price amid a run on the Iranian
currency that saw its dollar value drop by half on the black
market earlier this year.  The second-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, Iran said in February it will
accept payment for oil in any local currency or gold as new
sanctions make it harder for trading partners to pay in dollars
and euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
