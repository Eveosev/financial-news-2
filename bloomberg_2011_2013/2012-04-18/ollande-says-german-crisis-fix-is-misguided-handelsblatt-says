French presidential candidate
 Francois Hollande  delivered his call for a more activist
 European Central Bank  to Germany, sharpening his disagreement
with Chancellor Angela Merkel.  Hollande told the daily  Handelsblatt  newspaper that his
strategy to fight the region’s financial crisis includes pushing
euro-area bonds, dropping plans to anchor a deficit-reduction
rules in nations’ constitutions and seeking new powers for the
ECB. Germany opposes each of the proposals.  Hollande, the Socialist candidate against  Nicolas Sarkozy ,
also said he would seek talks with Merkel on how to expand the
powers of the ECB to combat speculation against sovereign bonds,
Handelsblatt said. Hollande wasn’t more specific.  “It’s necessary to cut the deficit but everyone knows that
without economic growth the debt quota will rise faster,” he
said.  Both Hollande and Sarkozy have made the Frankfurt-based
central bank a target in their campaign. Sarkozy has called for
expanding the ECB’s mandate to include spurring growth and not
just controlling inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
