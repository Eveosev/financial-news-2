Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD) , a
Chinese mobile-phone chipmaker, tumbled to an eight-month low in
New York after Chardan Capital Markets recommended buying shares
of competitor  RDA Microelectronics Inc. (RDA)   American depositary receipts of Shanghai-based Spreadtrum
lost 7.8 percent to $13.67, extending its three-day decline to
19 percent, at the close of trading in New York. It was the
lowest close since Aug. 8. Pudong, China-based RDA gained for a
third day, adding 2.7 percent to $12.99, a two-month high.  RDA is taking market share away from Spreadtrum as it
undercuts its competitor’s pricing, said  Jay Srivatsa , the
managing director of equity research at Chardan, who initiated
coverage of RDA with a  buy  rating today. Srivatsa has a neutral
rating on Spreadtrum.  “RDA is killing their pricing which is a huge negative for
Spreadtrum,” Srivatsa said in a phone interview from New York.
“The pricing has been coming down quite a bit, and we’re seeing
that RDA is becoming a low-cost leader, and that’s driving
Spreadtrum’s  margins  down.”  Spreadtrum also declined after  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s
largest semiconductor maker, forecast second-quarter gross
margin that was lower than some analysts predicted, said JMP
Securities analyst Alex Gauna in a phone interview from San
Francisco.  Intel slipped 1.8 percent to $27.95.  To contact the reporter on this story:
