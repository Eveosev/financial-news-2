Sony Corp. (6758)  plans to cut 326 jobs at
EMI Publishing within two years after U.S. and European
regulators approve its $2.2 billion acquisition of the U.K.
music company.  Sony/ATV Music Publishing, jointly owned by Sony and the
estate of  Michael Jackson , may eliminate 152 positions in the
first year, with the rest coming afterward, according to a
document by  UBS AG (UBSN) , an adviser to Tokyo-based Sony. It lists $39
million in severance costs.  The European Commission will grant regulatory approval to
the acquisition tomorrow, the Financial Times reported today.
Sony/ATV will administer copyrights of EMI songs for the
Japanese company and its investors. The combined catalogs will
give Sony/ATV 31 percent of the market, making it the world’s
biggest music publisher, according to the document.  Sony estimates $106 million in restructuring costs at EMI
Publishing in the two years after the deal closes, according to
the document.  The job cuts, amounting to about 60 percent of the staff,
will generate $70 million in annual cost reductions, The New
York Times reported yesterday, citing a confidential 74-page UBS
document.  “Discussing details of any integration plan is premature
while the regulatory approval processes are ongoing,” Jimmy Asci, a Sony/ATV spokesman, said in an e-mail. He declined to
comment further.  Sony/ATV agreed to buy the unit in November with investors
that include music billionaire  David Geffen  and the Mubadala
Development Co., Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
