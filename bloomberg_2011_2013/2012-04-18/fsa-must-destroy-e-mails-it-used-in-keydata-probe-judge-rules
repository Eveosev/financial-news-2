The Financial Services Authority
must destroy privileged attorney-client e-mails it obtained
during its investigation into collapsed investment firm Keydata
Investment Services Ltd., a London judge said.  The privileged documents must be deleted or destroyed, and
all references to them redacted, Judge Ian Burnett said today.
Keydata and its founder Stewart Ford won a ruling in October
that the regulator shouldn’t have used the e-mails.  The judge refused requests by Ford’s lawyers to have the
FSA’s 2010 warning notice thrown out, and for any investigator
who had seen the protected e-mails to be removed from its probe.  “I do not consider that the fact that the investigators
and in-house lawyers have seen material which cannot now be
used,” creates prejudice against the Ford, Burnett said.  The FSA had to suspend its four-year investigation into
Keydata because of a judicial review into its conduct. Keydata
administered 2.8 billion pounds ($4.42 billion) of assets when
the FSA asked a court to place it into administration in 2009.  The regulator was examining whether Keydata targeted
investors with potentially misleading advertisements, and
potential tax irregularities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
