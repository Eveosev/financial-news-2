Actividades de Construccion y
Servicios SA will book a loss of at least 700 million euros
($918 million) after its lenders forced it to sell 3.7 percent
of  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , El Economista reported.  UBS AG and Societe Generale SA, the banks leading the
bookbuilding, threatened to foreclose on loans to ACS unless the
company reduced its stake in  Spain â€™s biggest power company, the
newspaper said, without saying how it obtained the information.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
