The yen fell against most its major
counterparts as  Bank of Japan (8301)  officials signaled they’ll keep
acting to stem its strength to spur economic growth.  The greenback gained and Canada’s dollar slid after more
Americans filed  jobless claims  last week and a regional
manufacturing gauge dropped, increasing demand for the perceived
safety of U.S. debt. The pound and Swedish krona climbed as
investors bet the Bank of England and the Riksbank will refrain
from further monetary easing.  “Yen dovishness is here to stay, and they are the only
major central bank that is continuing to ease right now,” said
 Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at Barclays Plc in New
York. “Further yen weakness is likely, but probably at a slower
pace than we have seen in February and March. U.S. economic
prospects were looking extremely strong back then, and now they
are looking much more mixed.”  The yen depreciated 0.4 percent to 81.61 per dollar at 5
p.m.  New York  time and touched 81.74, the weakest level since
April 10. The Japanese currency weakened 0.5 percent against the
euro to 107.21, after earlier gaining 0.1 percent. The euro rose
0.1 percent to $1.3138 after falling 0.4 percent earlier.  The Bank of  Japan  is “committed” to monetary easing,
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said yesterday in a speech in New
York. Deputy Governor  Kiyohiko Nishimura  said the central bank
is ready to implement additional easing if necessary.  Trade Deficit  Japan had a  trade deficit  of 82.6 billion yen ($1 billion)
in March, versus a revised surplus of 29.4 billion yen in the
previous month, data showed today. The prediction in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 223.2 billion-yen shortfall.  The yen has weakened 8.3 percent this year, the worst
performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar has lost 2.1
percent, and the euro has fallen 0.6 percent.  The euro was recovering against the yen after touching an
eight-week low of 104.63 on April 16. There is support at
105.71, the 200-day moving average, and resistance at
yesterday’s high of 106.90, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A resistance level is an area on a chart where
analysts anticipate orders to sell a currency will be grouped,
and a support level is an area where they expect buy orders to
be clustered.  Brazil’s Real  Brazil ’s real dropped against the dollar as the central
bank lowered  interest rates  and indicated more cuts may be on
the way. Bank President Alexandre Tombini reduced the benchmark
Selic rate by three-quarters of a percentage point yesterday to
9 percent. Policy makers signaled slowing inflation and weaker
global growth may allow more reductions.  The real slid as much as 0.8 percent to 1.8935 per dollar,
the weakest level since November, before trading at 1.8805.  The Swedish krona gained versus all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. It advanced 0.2 percent to
6.7303 per dollar and appreciated 0.1 percent versus the euro to
8.8413. The krona has rallied since Sweden’s Riksbank kept its
main  interest rate  unchanged yesterday at 1.5 percent. Four of
18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a cut.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  added as much as 0.3 percent to 79.828
before trading at 79.570 as Treasury 10-year notes yielded below
2 percent for a fifth straight day.  Manufacturing in the  Philadelphia region  expanded at a
slower pace in April, the Federal  Reserve Bank  of Philadelphia’s
general economic index showed. The gauge fell to 8.5, the lowest
level since January, from 12.5 in March.  U.S. Trade Partners  Canada’s dollar and Mexico’s peso tumbled after claims for
unemployment benefits in the U.S., their biggest trade partner,
fell to 386,000 in the week ended April 14, from a revised
388,000 the previous week, Labor Department figures showed.  The Canadian currency declined against all of its most-
traded counterparts, falling 0.5 percent to 99.57 cents per  U.S.
dollar . Mexico’s peso fell 0.1 percent to 13.1980.  Investors should bet  New Zealand ’s currency will fall
against the Canadian dollar as the nation’s central banks
diverge in policy outlooks, BNP Paribas SA said. The Bank of
 Canada  said this week higher interest rates “may become
appropriate,” while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has warned
that a strong currency may delay rate boosts.  The kiwi, as the South Pacific currency is nicknamed,
traded at 81.02 Canadian cents today in New York, up 0.2
percent. Investors should enter the trade at current levels with
the target of 78 cents, Michael Sneyd, a currency strategist at
BNP Paribas in  London , wrote to clients today.  The euro fluctuated after Citigroup Inc.’s  Michael Saunders 
wrote in a client note today that credit-rating companies will
probably downgrade France over the next two to three years
regardless of whether President Nicolas Sarkozy or his Socialist
challenge,  Francois Hollande , wins the election. Italy,  Spain ,
Ireland and Portugal also face potential downgrades, he wrote.  Pound Advances  The pound gained 0.1 percent to 81.84 per euro and rose 0.2
percent to $1.6052.  The  Bank of England ’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee
voted 8-1 in seeking no change to the 325 billion-pound asset-
purchase target, according to minutes of the April 4-5 meeting
released yesterday.  Adam Posen , a policy maker who voted for
more quantitative easing in March, ended his push for further
stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
