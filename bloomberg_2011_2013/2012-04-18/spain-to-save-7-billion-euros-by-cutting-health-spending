Spanish Health Minister Ana Mato
said the tax-funded health-care system will cut spending by 7
billion euros ($9.2 billion) amid efforts to rein in the euro
area’s  fourth-largest  budget gap and curb borrowing costs.  The measures include using more generic drugs, reducing
purchase prices and centralizing buying, Mato told reporters in
Madrid today following a meeting with the 17 regional
governments.  Patients will also be charged more for drugs. Middle-income
earners will pay 50 percent, up from 40 percent, and pensioners,
who receive free medication now, will pay 10 percent. Free
prescriptions will be limited to those without jobs and benefits
and retired people on the lowest pensions.  To convince investors  Spain  won’t be the fourth euro member
to need a bailout, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is implementing
the deepest spending cuts in more than three decades to shrink
the nation’s budget shortfall by 3.2 percentage points of gross
domestic product this year amid a  recession .  Health and education account for about 60 percent of
regions’ expenditure and the regions were responsible for most
of Spain’s overspending last year.  The regions, confronted with a slump in tax receipts since
a housing bubble popped in 2008, have accumulated unpaid bills
to health suppliers that amounted to 12 billion euros of drugs
and health-care equipment in February, according to the
pharmaceutical lobby Farmaindustria.  Rajoy’s People’s Party government, in power since December,
has presented measures to help regions and town halls pay
suppliers, in exchange for their submitting plans to reorder
their finances.  To contact the reporters on this story:
