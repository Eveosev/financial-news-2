     April 18 (Bloomberg) --Roy Bagattini, senior vice
president for  Carlsberg A/S (CARLA) ’s Asia region comments on Chongqing
after Bo Xilai’s removal as Chongqing Communist Party Secretary.
Carlsberg last year signed an agreement with 30 percent-owned
Chinese partner  Chongqing Brewery Co. (600132)  to make Tuborg in the
western China city.  “We are very collaborative with the Chongqing government.
We are very focused on our business there.”  “Our relationship with the local government, our
relationship with the management we feel is going from strength
to strength. We are still very optimistic and very positive
about the investments being made and we will continue to make
further investments. We see no reason for us to change and think
differently about our strategies in Chongqing today.”
