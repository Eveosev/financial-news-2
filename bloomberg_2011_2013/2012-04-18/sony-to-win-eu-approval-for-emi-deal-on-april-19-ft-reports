A Sony Corp.-led group will win
European Union approval for its $2.2 billion purchase of EMI
Group’s publishing unit tomorrow, the Financial Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Sony offered further concessions in addition to an earlier
proposal to sell Sony/ATV’s Famous Music and EMI’s Virgin Music
catalogs in order to avoid an expanded EU probe, the FT said
today.  Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the EU regulator,
declined to comment on the case when contacted by Bloomberg
News. Jimmy Asci, spokesman for Sony/ATV in  New York  also
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
