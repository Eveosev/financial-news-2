OAO Phosagro (PHOR) , billionaire Andrey Guriev’s fertilizer maker, will be able to issue new  OAO Apatit 
stock to fund projects after  Russia  sells a stake in the unit,
diluting shareholdings rivals may buy from the government.  Phosagro is interested in buying the shares, it said today
by e-mail. That may put it in competition with UralChem and OAO
Acron, which are considering bidding as Russia seeks to dispose
of 20 percent of the phosphate unit as early as this year.  Phosagro and its affiliates control more than 75 percent of
Apatit’s voting shares, according to the e-mail. New stock can
be issued once Russia sells its holding “even if the stake will
be acquired by parties other than Phosagro,” the company said.  Apatit, which runs  Europe ’s largest phosphate deposit in
Murmansk region, has a market value of $1.7 billion, valuing the
state’s shareholding at about $340 million. The government is
yet to announce the terms of the proposed offer of the stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
