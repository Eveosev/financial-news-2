Sweden’s krona fell against most of
its major peers before the nation’s central bank presents its
latest interest-rate decision.  The Swedish currency was little changed against the dollar
and the euro. The Riksbank will keep its repo rate at 1.5
percent after lowering it twice since December, according to 14
of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Four predict policy
makers will lower the rate to 1.25 percent.  The krona traded at 8.8817 per euro at 7:01 a.m. London
time, and 6.7705 per dollar. It weakened against 11 of its 16
major peers, falling most against the South Korean won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
