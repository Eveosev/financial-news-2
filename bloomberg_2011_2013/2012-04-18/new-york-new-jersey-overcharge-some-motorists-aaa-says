New York ,  New Jersey  and at least
three other states unfairly instituted policies of charging out-
of-state motorists higher tolls through a computerized
collection system, the  American Automobile Association  said.  New Hampshire , Maine and  West Virginia  are also imposing
higher tolls on out-of-state cars traveling with E-ZPass, which
uses transponders to charge an account when drivers pass, AAA
spokesman  Michael Green  said, citing member complaints.  The automobile club plans to express its concerns at a
Senate Commerce Committee  subcommittee hearing  today.  “There is no reason for one authority to charge some E-
ZPass holders a higher toll,” said Robert Darbelnet, AAA’s
president and chief executive officer, in a letter to the E-
ZPass Interagency Group today. He said the only purpose may be
to “take advantage of drivers who may be ‘from out-of-state.’”  The  E-ZPass Interagency Group  is an association of 24 toll
agencies in 14 mostly East Coast states that use the same
transponder technology to administer tolls, according to the
agency’s website. More than 22 million E-ZPass devices are in
circulation, according to the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
