Indonesia ’s rupiah snapped two days
of losses after the central bank said it will concentrate more
on managing inflation than on spurring economic growth. Bonds
were little changed.  Bank Indonesia  is shifting its policy focus to consumer-
price gains, Perry Warjiyo, director of economic research and
monetary policy, said yesterday. The government raised $2.5
billion from sales of dollar-denominated securities, with
investors bidding for 3.2 times the amount offered, the  finance
ministry  said today.  “Bank Indonesia’s statement will have a positive effect on
the rupiah as it reassures foreign investors,” Klara Pramesti,
a Jakarta-based analyst in the treasury division at PT Bank
Negara Indonesia. “The successful bond auction boosts the
market’s appetite for riskier local assets.”  The rupiah traded at 9,177 per dollar as of 9:07 a.m. in
Jakarta, compared with 9,180 yesterday, according to prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell 0.4 percent
this week. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 6.75 percent
for a 10th day.  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds was
little changed at 6.07 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield reached a three-month high of 6.16 percent
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
