Lithuania may offer a 20 percent
stake in the country’s planned liquefied-natural-gas terminal on
the Baltic sea to foreign investors, the  Baltic News Service 
reported today, citing Energy Minister Arvydas Sekmokas.  The shares may be offered to companies providing equipment,
technology or gas supply, the newswire said. Norway’s  Hoegh LNG (HLNG) ,
the LNG vessel provider to the terminal, and  Cheniere Energy
Inc. (LNG)  of the U.S. may be among the potential investors, Sekmokas
was quoted as saying.  Lithuania plans to begin operations at the floating LNG
terminal at the end of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
