Dubai’s foreign trade climbed to a
record 1.1 trillion dirhams ($299 billion) in 2011, up 22
percent from the previous year, according to the customs
authority.  Imports increased 21 percent to 442 billion dirhams, while
exports rose 44 percent to 98 billion dirhams. Re-export trade
climbed 18 percent to 161 billion dirhams, the authority said.  India  was Dubai’s No. 1 trade partner last year, while
trade with Iran, which lies across the Persian Gulf, is still
“good,” Ahmed Butti Ahmed, director general of the Dubai
customs union, told reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
