Officials in  Argentina , the world’s
second-largest exporter of corn, will consider increasing export
quotas at a meeting of government officials and agricultural
producers today, an industry group said.  Officials also will discuss estimates for the corn crop and
domestic demand this afternoon, Ider Peretti, president of the
Argentine Producers Council, said in a phone interview today.  Argentina’s restriction on corn exports and drought will
reduce the size of the crop this year, as export limits deter
farmers from investing, said Juan Cruz Rey Kelly, an economist
at the Argentine Rural Confederations.  The government may increase the quota by 3 million to 4
million tons from its current level of 7.5 million tons, Cruz
Rey Kelly said in a phone interview today. A higher quota would
increase inflows of dollars from export sales, easing pressure
on the peso, after the government’s seizure of control of oil
producer  YPF SA (YPFD) , he said.  Argentina’s harvest may shrink to about 21.5 million tons
in the year that ends Sept. 30 from 23.6 million tons in the
prior year, according to data from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  and the International Grains Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
