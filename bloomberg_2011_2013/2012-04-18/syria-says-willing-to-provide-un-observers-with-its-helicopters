Syria  is willing to allow United
Nations observers to use its helicopters when necessary to
evacuate wounded people, foreign minister Walid al-Muallem said
today in Beijing.  Muallem said 250 observers is a “reasonable” number to be
able to monitor tension areas, he said. Mualllem said
“terrorist groups” have violated a United Nations-brokered
cease-fire 70 times in a single day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
