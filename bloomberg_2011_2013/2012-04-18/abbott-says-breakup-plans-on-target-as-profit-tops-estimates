Abbott Laboratories (ABT) , splitting into
a drugmaker and a diversified health-care business, reported
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates and raised its 2012
forecast as sales jumped more than expected for its top product.  First-quarter  revenue  climbed 4.6 percent to $9.46 billion
in the quarter, the Abbott Park, Illinois-based company said in
a statement today. Humira, an autoimmune drug, gained about 17
percent to $1.93 billion, beating the $1.85 billion average of
four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Miles White  said in October he
would split Abbott in two, with one company focused on new drugs
and the other on medical devices, generic medicines and
nutritional drinks. The company has said the breakup would be
completed by the end of this year.  “We remain focused on the process of separating Abbott
into two leading health care companies, which remains on track
to be completed by the end of the year,” White said in the
statement today.  Net income rose to $1.24 billion, or 78 cents a share, from
$864 million, or 55 cents, a year earlier, when the company took
charges for acquisitions and an accounting change. Earnings
excluding one-time items were $1.03 a share, beating the $1
average  estimate  of 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The company increased its 2012 earnings forecast to $5 and
$5.10 a share from a January projection of $4.95 to $5.05 a
share. That compares with an average estimate of $5.01 by 21
analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The pharmaceutical side of Abbott faces emerging
competition for Humira, the autoimmune drug that is the
company’s top seller. It also has experimental therapies for the
treatment of hepatitis C, and is in a race with drugmakers
including  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  and  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD)  to
develop new methods of treatment for the virus.  Abbott rose less than 1 percent to $60.46 at the close of
New York trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
