Lithuanian inflation, calculated
according to European Union standards, will probably slow to 2.9
percent in April, the statistics office said.  Consumer prices, which advanced 3.7 percent from a year
earlier in March, may rise 0.3 percent in April from the
previous month because of higher fuel and clothing costs, the
office in the capital, Vilnius, said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
