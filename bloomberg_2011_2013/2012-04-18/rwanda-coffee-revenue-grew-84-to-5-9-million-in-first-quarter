Rwandan coffee revenue surged 84
percent in the first quarter amid higher international prices
and increased demand for the country’s beans, the National
Agriculture Export Board said.  Earnings grew to $5.9 million in the three months through
March from $3.2 billion Rwandan francs a year earlier, Celestin
M. Gatarayiha, head of the coffee division at the Kigali-based
board, said in a phone interview today in the Rwandan capital.
He declined to comment on the reasons for the increase.  Last year,  Rwanda  earned a record $75 million from coffee
exports, compared with $56 million a year earlier, amid higher
international coffee prices and increased demand for Rwandan
beans. The country relies on coffee and tea to generate 48
percent of its export earnings, according to the  African
Development Bank .  Revenue for the whole of 2012 is expected to total $157
million amid increased production, with output forecast to reach
34,000 tons for the full year, Gatarayiha said. He didn’t
provide figures for 2011. Coffee production jumped 26 percent in
the first quarter to 1,594 metric tons, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
