Iraq  has proven oil reserves of 143
billion barrels and possible additional deposits that may bring
its total reserves to 214 billion barrels, said Hussain al- Shahristani, the country’s deputy prime minister for energy.  “This puts Iraq at the top of the list of countries with
large reserves,” he said at a conference in London today. The
minister was reiterating a figure of 143.1 billion barrels that
he announced in October 2010, which he said at that time does
not include oil in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region.  The world’s largest oil reserve holders include Saudi
Arabia, the biggest, and Iran, Iraq, Venezuela and Canada, once
oil sands and heavy  oil deposits  are included, according to  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy. BP listed a figure of
115 billion barrels for Iraq in its June 2011 review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
