Midwest gasoline rose to the
highest level in more than a week after inventories declined in
the region.  Regional supplies  fell 908,000 barrels to 51.4 million last
week, the Energy Department said today. Stockpiles have fallen
for eight of the past nine weeks.  “Gasoline is seeing some draws and things are picking
up,” said Steve Mosby, vice president of ADMO Energy LLC, a
supply consultant in  Kansas City , Missouri. “I think we’ve seen
the bottom” for prices in the Midwest.  The discount for regular gasoline in the Midwest, or Group
3, narrowed 1.75 cents to 20.38 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:49 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest level
since April 10. The discount was 24.25 cents on April 16.  The same fuel in  Chicago  strengthened 2.5 cents to a
discount of 11.5 cents a gallon.  Regular gasoline in the Gulf Coast was unchanged at a
discount of 14.88 cents versus futures.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  has no plans to start a fluid catalytic
cracker at the Meraux  refinery  in  Louisiana  within the next two
months, according to a person with knowledge of the situation
said yesterday.  The unit may return to operation in mid-June if profit
margins improve, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the information isn’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
