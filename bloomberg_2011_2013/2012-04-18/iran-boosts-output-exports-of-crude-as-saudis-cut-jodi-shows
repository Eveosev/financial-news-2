Iran  increased output and exports
of oil in February as Saudi Arabia cut back on production and
shipments, official data posted on the Joint Organization Data
Initiative’s  website  showed.  Iran, the second-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, increased crude output by 0.9
percent to 3.752 million barrels a day in February, according to
JODI figures posted late yesterday. Iran’s exports rose to 2.338
million barrels a day that month from 2.265 million in January.  The U.S. and European Union have strengthened sanctions
against Iran in recent months in a bid to pressure it to halt
its nuclear program. The EU imposed an embargo on Iranian oil
imports effective July 1.  Saudi Arabia  has pledged to meet
global demand, though Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi has said markets
are currently “balanced.”  Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer in OPEC, pumped
9.853 million barrels a day in February, 0.2 percent less than
the previous month, while reducing exports to 7.485 million
barrels a day from 7.507 million in January, the data showed.  “Inventories in Saudi Arabia and around the world are
full,” Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi said April 12 in  Seoul .  Oil inventories in Saudi Arabia rose 4.8 percent in
February from a month earlier, according to JODI data. The

storage within its territory compared with 254.6 million barrels
in January, JODI data show.  OPEC Exports  Exports of crude oil from Venezuela and  Nigeria  surged
during February, data showed. Venezuelan exports rose 13 percent
to 1.82 million barrels a day while Nigeria boosted shipments by

February, the highest monthly figure since December 2009,
according to the data. Qatar pumped 750,000 barrels a day during
the month, the highest level since June.  Angola  increased exports by 5.3 percent during the month
while Kuwait and Ecuador lowered exports. Iraqi exports were at
2.01 million barrels a day in February, the data show.  Algeria ,
 Libya , and the  United Arab Emirates  didn’t submit data for the
month.  The 12 members of OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of
global crude, produced 31.42 million barrels a day of crude in
February, the most since mid-2008, the Paris-based  International
Energy Agency  said in its monthly oil market report on March 14.
OPEC kept its output at around the same level, 31.43 million
barrels a day, in March, the IEA said on April 12.  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, compiles data provided by member governments. The IEF is
a group of nations accounting for more than 90 percent of global
oil and gas supply and demand, established as a forum for
producing and consuming countries to discuss international
 energy security .  To contact the reporter on this story:
