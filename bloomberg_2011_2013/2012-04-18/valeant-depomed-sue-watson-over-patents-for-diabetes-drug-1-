Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX)  and  Depomed Inc. (DEPO)  sued  Watson Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (WPI)  over patents for a diabetes drug.  Watson, based in Parsippany,  New Jersey , has filed an
application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market
generic copies of the diabetes medicine  Glumetza  before their
patents expire, Valeant and Depomed contend in a complaint filed
today in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “Plaintiffs will be substantially and irreparably harmed”
if Watson isn’t stopped from using the protected technology, and
Watson should pay damages and legal fees, lawyers for Valeant’s
Barbados unit and Menlo Park, California-based Depomed said in
court papers.  Watson faces similar allegations in a patent-infringement
lawsuit filed a month ago in the same court by  Abbott
Laboratories (ABT)  over generic copies of the Niaspan cholesterol
drug.  Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for Watson, didn’t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the
allegations.  The case is Depomed v. Watson, 12-CV-492, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 6,488,962; 7,780,987.  To contact the reporter on this story:
