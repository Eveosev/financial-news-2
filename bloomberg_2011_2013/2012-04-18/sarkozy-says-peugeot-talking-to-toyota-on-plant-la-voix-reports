PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  is in talks
with Toyota Motor Corp. to make commercial vehicles at the
French carmaker’s Sevelnord plant, French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said, according to La Voix du Nord.  The continuation of manufacturing at the plant is assured,
Sarkozy said in in an  interview , the local French newspaper
reported.  Sevelnord, located near the northern French city of
Valenciennes, is currently operated under a joint venture with
Fiat SpA. The partnership with the Italian carmaker won’t be
renewed when it expires in 2017, Peugeot said in May, raising
questions over the future of the factory.  Discussions between Toyota and Peugeot, Europe’s second-
biggest carmaker, were first reported by Bloomberg on March 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
