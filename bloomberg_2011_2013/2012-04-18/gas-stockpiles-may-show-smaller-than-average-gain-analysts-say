U.S. natural-gas stockpiles
expanded by 1 percent last week as seasonal weather kept gains
near the five-year average, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories rose by 24 billion cubic feet to 2.511 trillion
in the week ended April 13, based on the median of 20 estimates.
The five-year average change for the week is an increase of 26
billion, according to the Energy Department, which is scheduled
to release its weekly supply report tomorrow.  Gas has dropped 35 percent this year to decade lows as
record production and mild winter weather caused a widening
supply  surplus . Stockpiles of 2.487 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended April 6 were 59 percent above the five-year average,
last week’s report showed. Supplies the previous week were 61
percent higher, the  biggest gap  since April 2006.  “We had close-to-normal levels of heating-degree days in
the consuming East and West regions last week,” said Eric Bickel, a natural-gas analyst at Summit Energy Services in
Louisville,  Kentucky , who estimates stockpiles rose by 26
billion cubic feet.  Heating-degree days are a weather-based measure of gas
demand. A lower-than-normal increase in stockpiles may not be
enough for a sustained increase in prices, Bickel said.  “We’re still at robust levels of storage,” he said.  Winter in the lower 48 states was the warmest since 2000,
the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville,  North Carolina ,
said March 7.  Record Production  U.S. gas production reached record levels in 2011 on
increased output from shale formations from  Pennsylvania  to
 Texas . Output gained 0.8 percent in January to 83.17 billion
cubic feet a day from December, the Energy Department said in
its EIA-914 report March 29.  About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the department.  Gas consumption in the U.S. declines after the winter
heating season ends and before hot weather boosts consumption by
 power plants  to run air conditioners.  The analyst stockpile estimates ranged from gains of 10
billion to 41 billion cubic feet.  Natural gas futures last week dropped 10.8 cents, or 5.2
percent, to $1.981 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Gas settled unchanged today at $1.951.  To contact the reporter on this story:
