Support for  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s governing Christian Democratic bloc fell one percentage
point to 35 percent in a weekly poll of voting-age Germans.  The Free Democratic Party, Merkel’s junior coalition ally,
polled 5 percent, unchanged from a week earlier and enough to
enter parliament if elections were held now, according to the
Forsa poll for Stern magazine and broadcaster RTL published
today.  Among opposition parties, the  Social Democrats  rose one
point to 25 percent, the Greens gained one point to 12 percent
and the Left declined one point to 7 percent. The Pirate Party,
which doesn’t have seats in the national parliament, has 13
percent, according to the poll.  The survey of 2,001 people was conducted April 10-13 and
has a margin of error of as much as 2.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
