Peru ’s sol strengthened for the
second time this week as companies bought the currency to pay
local income taxes, leading the central bank to buy dollars to
stem gains.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.6540 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close of trading, from 2.6565 yesterday, according to Deutsche
Bank AG’s local unit. The currency earlier touched 2.6510, the
strongest since 1997,  data  from Peru’s financial regulator show.  Companies are selling the U.S. currency before an April 26
deadline for monthly tax payments. Mining companies, which
account for about 30 percent of the Andean nation’s income-tax
revenue, are the main sellers of dollars for tax purposes,
according to  Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank Peru.  “Local flows carry more weight” than today’s declines in
copper, gold and U.S. equities, Guerrero said.  The central bank  bought  $162 million in the  spot market 
today to slow gains in the sol. It paid an average of 2.6548
soles per dollar, the bank said on its website.  Copper, Peru’s top export, declined for the first time in
three days on concern the Chinese economy is slowing and  Spain ’s
debt crisis is getting worse, while gold also fell. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.4 percent.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.34 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price dropped 0.13 centimo to 116.54 centimos
per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
