China’s stocks  rose the most in
more than two months as investors speculated the government will
ease monetary policy to boost the economy and the  International
Monetary Fund  raised its forecasts for global growth.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362)  and China Shenhua Energy Co. advanced
more than 2 percent on optimism an improving world economy will
boost demand for commodities.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  and
Poly Real Estate Group Co. led a gauge of financial stocks to
the third-largest gain among 10 industry groups. CSR Corp.
jumped the most in three months after the Xinhua News Agency
said the company will supply high-speed trains to  Hong Kong .  “There is speculation that banks’ reserve requirement
ratios will be cut and that’s driving stocks higher,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co.,
which oversees $285 million. “The IMF forecast has eased
investors’ concerns about growth in the external environment.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 45.86 points, or 2
percent, to 2,380.85 at the close, the biggest gain since Feb.
8. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  climbed 2.3 percent to 2,599.91. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 1.2 percent in  New York 
yesterday.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai index was at 19.2
today, the highest since March 2. About 8.5 billion shares
changed hands yesterday, 2.3 percent lower than the daily
average this year.  Slowing Economy  The Shanghai Composite has climbed 8.2 percent this year
amid speculation the government will take measures to boost the
economy and equities.  South Korea ’s central bank will buy $300
million in Chinese shares over next 3 months, Finet Newswire
reported today, citing an unidentified foreign exchange official
at the bank. Stocks in the gauge are valued at 10.1 times
estimated earnings, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on
Jan. 6, according to weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  A gauge of financial stocks in the CSI 300 gained 2.6
percent, the third-biggest gain among the 10 industry groups.
Construction Bank, the nation’s second-biggest lender, rose 1.3
percent to 4.74 yuan.  China  Citic Bank Corp. added 2.8 percentt
o 4.45 yuan. Poly Real Estate, the second-largest developer,
rose 4.7 percent to 12.19 yuan. Gemdale Corp. added 4.1 percent.  Signs that an economic slowdown is intensifying boosted
speculation the central bank will cut lenders’ reserve-
requirement ratios for a second time this year. A statistics
bureau report today showed China’s home prices falling in a
record 37 of 70 cities tracked by the government in March.
Foreign direct investment sank for a fifth month, while the
economy expanded 8.1 percent in the first quarter, the slowest
pace in almost three years, reports over the past week showed.  ‘Downward Pressure’  The central bank should lower the reserve-requirement ratio
and adjust the loan-to-deposit ratio to increase banks’ lending
capacity and meet credit demand in the economy, Wang Jun, a
researcher with the China Center for International Economic
Exchanges, said at a Beijing seminar with his comments posted on
www.china.com.cn, a website controlled by the State Council
Information Office.  China’s economy  faces no risks of a so-called hard landing
this year, even as the government should be vigilant against the
chance of growth decelerating too quickly, Wang said.  The economy is still seeing downward pressure and the
second quarter may mark a “lower point” for growth before it
slowly accelerates in the second half, Zhu Baoliang, chief
economist at the State Information Center’s forecast department,
said at the Beijing seminar.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal,
added 3.5 percent to 25.30 yuan. Tongling Nonferrous Metals
Group Co., the second largest, rose 3.5 percent to 20.60 yuan.
Shenhua, the nation’s biggest coal producer, gained 2.4 percent
to 26.53 yuan.  China Coal Energy Co. (601898) , the second largest,
climbed 2.2 percent to 9.26 yuan.  IMF Forecasts  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.2 percent after the
IMF said the world economy will expand 3.5 percent this year and
4.1 percent in 2013, up from January projections of 3.3 percent
and 4 percent, as the euro region stabilizes and the U.S.
outlook improves. The lender kept a forecast of 8.2 percent
growth for China, where policy makers last month cut their 2012
own target to 7.5 percent, the lowest level since 2004.  Equities also rose as  Spain  sold more bonds than targeted.
Spain sold 3.18 billion euros of bills, compared with a maximum
target of 3 billion euros the Treasury set for the sale.  Europe  and the U.S. are China’s top two export markets,
making up about 35 percent of the nation’s overseas shipments,
according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. China’s overseas
shipments rose 8.9 percent last month. Export growth was down
from 18.4 percent in February.  CSR jumped 6.8 percent to 4.84 yuan, its biggest advance
since Jan. 17. Delivery of the first train will start next year,
Xinhua reported yesterday. The trains will be used for the
Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, which is
expected to start operations in 2015, it said.  The  IShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 1.2 percent to $37.52
yesterday after a two-day decline.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
