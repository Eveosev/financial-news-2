ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM)  and RTL
Group SA are likely to fail in their bid to create a joint
online platform, Deutsche-Presse Agentur said, citing comments
by Juergen Kuehnen, presiding judge of a Dusseldorf court.  The judge agreed with last year’s decision by Germany’s
antitrust authority that such a platform would “strengthen the
duopoly” already in place among the two broadcasters, DPA
reported. The ruling is scheduled for June 20, the newswire
said.  Julian Geist, a ProSiebenSat.1 spokesman, declined to
comment, when contacted by Bloomberg News. A spokesman for RTL
couldn’t immediately be reached by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
