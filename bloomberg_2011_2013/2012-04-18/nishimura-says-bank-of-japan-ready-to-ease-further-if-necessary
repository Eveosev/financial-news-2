Bank of Japan (8301)  Deputy Governor
 Kiyohiko Nishimura  said the central bank is ready to implement
additional easing if necessary, fueling speculation that further
loosening is likely this month.  “The bank is committed to implementing additional easing
measures, if deemed necessary,” Nishimura said in a speech
today in Okayama, western Japan. “It is vital to make efforts
both to firmly support the recently observed upward momentum
toward economic recovery and to strengthen growth potential.”  Nishimura’s comments will encourage speculation that the
central bank will expand its asset-purchase fund for the second
time in three months, economist Mari Iwashita said. The central
bank will hold a meeting on April 27 to review an estimate that
prices will rise 0.5 percent in the fiscal year starting next
April, compared with a goal of 1 percent inflation.  “Nishimura is signaling the BOJ is serious about easing,”
said Iwashita, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities
Inc. in  Tokyo .“His comments reinforced a view that the BOJ will
take additional accommodative policies this month.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
