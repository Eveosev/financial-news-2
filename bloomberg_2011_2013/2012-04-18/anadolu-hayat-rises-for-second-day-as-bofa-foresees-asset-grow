Anadolu Hayat Emekliklik AS (ANHYT) ,
 Turkey ’s largest pension fund, rose for a second day as Bank of
America Merrill Lynch said it would be the main beneficiary of a
government plan to encourage savings.  The shares rose 2.6 percent to 3.95 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the highest level since April 5.  “On the back of the new incentives, we expect pension
assets under management to increase from 15 billion liras
currently to 49 billion liras at year-end 2015,” analysts Ecem Nalbantgil and Turker Hamzaoglu said in a report issued today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
