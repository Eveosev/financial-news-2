Hungary’s benchmark  BUX (BUX)  stock index
fell for the first time in three days, down 0.3 percent to
17,551.57 by the close in Budapest.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, fell as
much as 3.8 percent and last traded 0.7 percent lower at 3,499
forint. The government failed to allay all of the European
Central Bank’s concerns in a dispute that is holding up talks on
a bailout deal for the country.  Est Media Vagyonkezelo Nyrt. (ESTMEDIA HB), a Hungarian
entertainment company, rose as much as 11 percent and ended 2
percent higher at 101 forint. The stock’s 13 percent plunge in
the previous two days pushed its 14-day  relative strength  index
to 28 yesterday. Levels below 30 indicate to some technical
analysts a security is oversold. The RSI last traded at 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
