European Union Tax Commissioner
Algirdas Semeta said the bloc needs “to go further” in
fighting  tax havens  and “aggressive” tax planning so that
businesses and companies pay what they owe.  “We need to leverage the economic and political muscle of
the union to ensure that we defend ourselves against non-
cooperative jurisdictions and others that do not play fair,”
Semeta said today in remarks to the European Parliament. EU
nations need to work together to limit fraud and  tax evasion , he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
