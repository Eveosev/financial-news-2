after the Energy Department reported inventories declined more
than expected last week.  Futures rebounded from their lows as  inventories  of
gasoline fell 3.67 million barrels to 214 million in the seven
days ended April 13. The median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for a 1.1 million-barrel decrease.  May-delivery gasoline fell 5.75 cents, or 1.8 percent, to
$3.1765 a gallon at 10:36 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices traded at $3.1622 before the reportâ€™s release
at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government said heating oil and diesel  inventories 
dropped 2.91 million barrels to 129 million. Analysts forecast a
125,000-barrel decrease, according to the survey.  Heating oil for May delivery fell 1.29 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.1137 a gallon. The price was $3.1063 before the
