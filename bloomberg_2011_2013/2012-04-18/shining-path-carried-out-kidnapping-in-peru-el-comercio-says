Peru’s Shining Path guerrilla group
said it took hostage 36 gas construction workers for six days
last week to protest the policies of President Ollanta Humala
and further its objective of annihilating the armed forces, El
Comercio  reported .  The group killed four policemen and shot down an army
helicopter searching for the kidnapped workers, the Lima-based
newspaper said, citing comments by Martin Quispe Palomino, a
senior member of the insurgent group who’s also known Comrade
Gabriel.  Construction companies  Skanska AB (SKAB)  and Construcciones
Modulares paid no ransom for the workers’ release, despite an
initial demand for $10 million, Quispe told reporters who
traveled to a jungle area of the Cuzco region in the south of
the country where the abduction took place April 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
