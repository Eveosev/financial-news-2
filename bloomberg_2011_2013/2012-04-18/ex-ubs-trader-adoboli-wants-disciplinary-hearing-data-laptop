Lawyers for Kweku Adoboli, a former
 UBS AG (UBSN)  trader who allegedly caused a $2.3 billion loss from
unauthorized trading, told a judge prosecutors aren’t providing
them sufficient information.  Defense attorney  Charles Sherrard  said he wants to know
“the nature of any interviews” from disciplinary hearing with
Adoboli’s co-workers on the Swiss bank’s Delta One trading desk.  Adoboli, 31, also should have a laptop computer to work on
his defense from jail, Sherrard said at a hearing at a  London 
criminal court today.  A judge agreed with a prosecution request to set the
hearing on the disclosure motion for June and said prison
officials should provide Adoboli with access to material
regarding his case on compact disc or DVD.  The former trader has been in custody since his arrest by
London police Sept. 15. Adoboli, who holds a Ghanaian passport,
was denied bail in February and is being held at Wandsworth
prison in southwest London awaiting a trial in early September.  The U.K. and Swiss finance regulators are investigating the
risk controls at UBS’s investment bank that didn’t prevent the
allegedly unauthorized trades.  Adoboli, who worked for the investment bank’s Delta One
desk, which handles trades for clients -- or risks the bank’s
own money -- typically speculating on, or hedging the
performance of, a basket of securities. The loss allegedly came
from trading in Standard & Poor’s 500,  DAX (DAX)  and EuroStoxx index
futures, according to the Zurich-based bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
