Praktiker AG (PRA) ,  Germany ’s largest
home-improvement retailer, fell to the lowest in more than three
months after postponing its annual meeting amid talks with
“potential investors” on financing a reorganization.  Praktiker  tumbled  as much as 6.7 percent to 1.37 euros, the
lowest intraday price since Jan. 5, and traded down 3.4 percent
as of 12:10 p.m. in Frankfurt. The company will put off the
annual shareholders meeting, originally  scheduled  for May 31,
until an unspecified date in the second half of June, Praktiker
said today in an e-mailed statement.  The financing of Praktiker’s restructuring program remains
on the meeting’s agenda, the Kirkel-based company said. The
management board and the supervisory board jointly decided to
delay the meeting as the talks with investors still require
further examination, it said.  The stock has fallen 81 percent in the last 12 months as
the retailer has cut earnings forecasts and asked bondholders to
contribute to its restructuring measures.  Chief Executive Officer Thomas Fox, who ran German
department-store operator Karstadt for two years after its
insolvency, was appointed to his current post in August with a
mandate to stop cash outflow and narrow losses. He announced a
300 million-euro ($393 million) financing program in November as
part of a reorganization that includes eliminating unprofitable
outlets and cutting 1,400 jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
