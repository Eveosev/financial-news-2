Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) , the unprofitable
wireless-broadband wholesaler, fell to its lowest price since
January after  Verizon Wireless  said it will sell some of its
spectrum.  Shares of Clearwire declined 6.9 percent to $1.76 at the
close in New York, after earlier retreating 20 percent. The
Bellevue, Washington-based company’s shares have dropped 70
percent in the past 12 months.  Clearwire, which hasn’t reported an annual profit in at
least five years, could be forced by creditors to sell spectrum
assets, which were worth as much as $4 billion at the end of
September, Ping Zhao, a CreditSights Inc. analyst, has said.  Any sale of good quality spectrum makes Clearwire’s
holdings less valuable, Christopher King, an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co., said in an interview today. King has a hold
rating on the shares.  Verizon plans to conduct an open-sale process for all of
its 700 megahertz A and B spectrum licenses, covering dozens of
major U.S. cities and some smaller markets, according to a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
