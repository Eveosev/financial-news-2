Colombia ’s peso fell the most in a
week as European fiscal turmoil sapped demand for riskier assets
in emerging markets.  The peso slipped 0.3 percent to 1,774.60 per U.S. dollar at
10:10 a.m. in Bogota, the most since April 10. The currency was
still up 9.3 percent this year in the best performance among all
of the currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The market is focusing on uncertainty over Europe,” said
Lucia Duarte, a currency strategist in Bogota at  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) ,
the nation’s biggest bank. “That’s driving slight decreases in
the peso as well as other currencies in the region.”  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 was little changed at 7.1 percent, according to
the central bank.  Global stocks declined as the Bank of  Spain  reported today
that non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending
jumped to 8.16 percent in February, the highest level since
1994, from less than 1 percent in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
