Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s seizure of  YPF SA (YPFD)  will reduce investment
in  oil fields  as energy producers flock to other Latin American
countries, WTRG Economics said.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows oil rigs, an indicator of
spending on production, fell year-over-year in Argentina, while
energy producers increased installations in neighboring Brazil,
according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  The rig count in Argentina
dropped 14 percent to 49 rigs in March, while in Brazil the
number rose 11 percent to 82.  Fernandez wrested control of YPF, the nation’s largest
crude supplier, from Spanish owner  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  after a dispute
over declining production and spending on new drilling.  “You typically do not see companies rushing in to invest
more in countries that expropriate because you’re taking a good
chance you’re not going to see a return on your investment,”
 James Williams , an economist at WTRG, an energy-research firm in
London, Arkansas, said yesterday in an interview. “In countries
where that isn’t the case and have oil, you’re seeing an
increase in activity --Colombia and Brazil are two good
examples.”  Colombia surpassed Argentina as South America’s third-
largest crude producer in 2009, behind Brazil and Venezuela.  Fernandez tapped Planning Minister Julio de Vido to run
Buenos Aires-based YPF, in an expropriation which follows the
takeovers of airline Aerolineas Argentinas and a $24 billion
pension fund since she took office in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
