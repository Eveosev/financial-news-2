Jazztel Plc (JAZ) , a Spanish phone
company that’s winning market share from  Telefonica SA (TEF) , said
first-quarter profit climbed as it continued to grab broadband
customers and market share from competitors.  Net income in the first three months jumped 71 percent from
a year earlier to 11.8 million euros ($15.5 million), the
company said in a statement today. Earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization rose 21 percent to 39.2
million euros as sales gained 24 percent to 216.5 million euros.  Jazztel, one of the best stock performers this year, is
winning business as  Spain  faces its worst economic crisis in
decades and the country’s unemployment rate is the highest in
the European Union. The company won 85,141 broadband clients in
the period, boosting its total to 1.21 million.  Jazztel said Feb. 29 that 2012 net income will climb to 55
million euros to 65 million euros this year, making assumptions
about taxes and tax credits. Ebitda this year will be 170
million euros to 180 million euros, it said.  The company is “in line to meet its operational and
financial targets for 2012,” Jazztel said in a presentation
filed to regulators today.  Jazztel  shares  gained 2 percent to 5.16 euros in  Madrid 
today, valuing the company at 1.27 billion euros. The shares
have climbed 38 percent this year, compared with the benchmark
IBEX 35 Index’s 17 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
