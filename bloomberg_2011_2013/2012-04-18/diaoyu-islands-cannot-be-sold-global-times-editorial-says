Discussions in  Japan  about buying
the Diaoyu islands are a provocation as the chain belongs to
China, the state-run Global Times said in an editorial today.  “A strong response is necessary” after  Tokyo  Governor
Shintaro Ishihara said he’s interested in using public funds to
purchase the islands, the newspaper editorial said.  “A military option is not an easy choice today, but Asian
countries still have flexible means to solve this problem,” the
editorial said.  The uninhabited islands, known as Diaoyu in Chinese and
Senkaku in Japanese, are claimed by both countries. Control over
the area would give the holder rights to undersea natural gas
and oil fields.  In a statement yesterday, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Liu Weimin said any unilateral activities from the
Japanese side won’t change that the islands belong to  China .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
