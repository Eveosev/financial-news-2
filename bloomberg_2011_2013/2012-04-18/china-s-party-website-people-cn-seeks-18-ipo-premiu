The online business of People’s
Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper, raised
1.4 billion yuan ($222 million) in a Shanghai initial public
offering, nearly three times the amount it initially sought.  People.cn Co. sold 69.1 million shares at 20 yuan each, the
bottom of its latest  price range , according to a Shanghai Stock
Exchange filing yesterday. The sale values the company at 5.5
billion yuan, or 46 times earnings, 4.5 percent higher than the
industry average ratio of 44, according to the filing.  The Chinese website operator will have 276 million shares
outstanding after the share sale and an initial market
capitalization of $872 million. The  New York Times Co. (NYT)  is
currently valued at about $954 million.  People.cn’s parent, the newspaper  People’s Daily , was
founded in 1948, and for decades its editorials were considered
authoritative statements of government policy. Its page one
still carries a calligraphic title copied from a version
handwritten by  Mao Zedong , founder of the People’s Republic of
 China . People.cn’s advantages include its exclusive government
news content and stable advertising revenue from companies
including government-related entities, it said in an IPO
prospectus in January.  Renmin Sousuo, meaning “people’s search” in Chinese, is
another unit of the newspaper and 19 percent owned by People.cn.
It reported no revenue in 2010 and net income of 30 million
yuan, the prospectus shows, without providing further details.  Use of Proceeds  People.cn is raising more money than its confirmed
investment projects of as much as 1 billion yuan, according to
the  filing  this week. The excess amount, if not managed
properly, may affect profitability and cause the issuer’s share
price to drop in the future, the statement says.  People.cn plans to use part of the proceeds to fund a 527
million yuan upgrade of its networks and content, more than a
decade after rivals such as  Sina Corp. (SINA)  and  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  went
public in the U.S. Sina is valued at 32.1 times its 2011
earnings and Sohu has a price-earnings ratio of 11.4 for its
U.S.-listed shares.  In a detailed list of planned purchases, People.cn includes
a 400,000 yuan budget for 40 mobile devices including iPads and
iPhones, according to the prospectus, or 10,000 yuan per device.
The most expensive iPad model being offered on Apple Inc.’s
 Chinese website  costs 5,488 yuan, while the most advanced iPhone
was quoted for 6,788 yuan.  State-owned Shareholders  State-owned carriers  China Mobile Communications Corp. (941) ,
China United Network Communications Group, and China
Telecommunications Corp. are among the shareholders of
People.cn, according to the prospectus. People’s Daily owns
about 80 percent of the unit’s stock.  People.com.cn, the main website operated by People.cn, was
the 50th most popular website in China on Aug. 22, according to
the prospectus, which cited data from Chinarank.org.cn. The
website of New York-listed Sina was ranked fourth on that day,
while Sohu’s placed seventh, according to the document.  Revenue rose 75 percent to 331.7 million yuan in 2010 from
190 million yuan a year earlier, according to the prospectus.
Profit more than tripled to 81.6 million yuan in 2010.  People.cn has been granted a corporate tax waiver for the
four years through 2013, according to the prospectus. It saved
20 million yuan in 2010 because of that policy. The website
operator provides information services for the government, and
China’s Ministry of Finance paid People.cn 74 million yuan in
2010 for such services, accounting for 22 percent of its total
revenue that year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
