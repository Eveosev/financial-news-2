Spanish, Italian and Portuguese 
banks are loading up on bonds issued by their own governments, 
a move that shifts more of the risk of sovereign default to 
European taxpayers from private creditors.  Holdings of Spanish government debt by lenders based in 
the country jumped 26 percent in two months, to 220 billion 
euros ($289 billion) at the end of January, data from Spain’s 
treasury
show. Italian banks increased ownership of their nation’s 
sovereign bonds by 31 percent to 267 billion euros in the three 
months ended in February, according to Bank of Italy data.
