Slovakia’s economy is likely to
 expand  about 2 percent this year as the euro-area country will
be affected by the slowdown in western  Europe , Finance Minister
Peter Kazimir told reporters in Bratislava today.  That forecast by Kazimir, who took office this month,
compares with his ministry’s March forecast of 2.3 percent
growth and the 3.3 percent achieved in 2011. The International
Monetary Fund said yesterday that it sees Slovakia’s economy
growing 2.4 percent this year.  Slovakia’s open economy is relying on exports to western
countries to drive growth. Slower-than-projected expansion
implies that additional measures will probably be needed to keep
the 2012  budget deficit  within the target of 4.6 percent of GDP,
Kazimir said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
