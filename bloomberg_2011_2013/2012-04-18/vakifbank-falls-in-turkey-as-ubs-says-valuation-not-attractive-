Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi (VAKBN)  TAO, a
state-run Turkish lender, fell as UBS Investment Research
recommended investors sell the shares, saying relative valuation
was “not attractive.”  The shares retreated 2.1 percent to 3.24 liras, the lowest
in more than a month.  “The stock does not appear attractive, in our view, on a
relative basis,” UBS analyst Serkan Gok said in a report today.  Vakifbank stock has soared 33 percent this year, compared
with an 18 percent jump in the Istanbul Stock Exchange National
100 Index and a 20 percent rise in the country’s  banking index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
