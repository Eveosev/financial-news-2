Former U.K. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has been asked to explain his role in the rendition of a
Libyan military commander who was tortured by Muammar Qaddafi’s
regime, according to a  law firm  representing the man.  Straw has been served with a letter requesting documents
following an article in the Sunday Times alleging he approved
British agents helping the then Libyan government, according to
Abdel Hakim Belhadj’s law firm Leigh Day & Co.  “If the former foreign secretary does not now own up to
his role in this extraordinary affair, he will need to face the
prospect of trying to defend his position in court,” said
lawyer Sapna Malik in an e-mailed statement.  The London-based law firm is representing Belhadj in his
claim against the British government and its security forces,
which he alleges was complicit in his rendition via the Indian
Ocean island of Diego Garcia in March 2004 and subsequent
torture in  Libya .  Straw’s office in Parliament declined to comment on the
matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
