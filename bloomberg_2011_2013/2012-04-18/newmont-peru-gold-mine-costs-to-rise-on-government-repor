Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s suspended
$4.8 billion gold mine in Peru will cost more to build because
of the recommendations in a government-commissioned review,
Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar said today.  Newmont, based in  Greenwood Village ,  Colorado , must change
the location of the reservoirs it plans to build at the Minas
Conga site, Pulgar said.  “This will definitely increase project costs,” Pulgar
said at a press conference in Lima. “It will be up to the
company to make a decision.”  Peru suspended the project and commissioned a review after
Andean farmers, concerned that the project would dry up water
supplies, blocked roads and destroyed Newmont installations in
November. Conga needs “substantive improvements” to gain
approval, according to Rafael Fernandez, author of a government-
commissioned study.  The 248-page report, which was published today on
government  websites  and will be discussed in public hearings,
showed Newmont’s original environmental impact study “meets
standards,” Mining Minister Jorge Merino said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Newmont has invested $800 million in the project. Newmont
fell 0.9 percent to $47.89 at the close in  New York . The stock
has dropped 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
