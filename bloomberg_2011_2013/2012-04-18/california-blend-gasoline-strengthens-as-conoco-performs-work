California-blend gasoline
strengthened against futures after  ConocoPhillips (COP)  reported
planned flaring at the  Los Angeles  oil refinery and was said to
start work early on a sulfur unit at the Rodeo plant.  Conoco will flare gases at the 139,000-barrel-a-day Los
Angeles refinery April 20, according to a regulatory notice. The
128,000-barrel-a-day Rodeo plant, north of San Francisco,
started work early on a sulfur unit that was shut last week
after a fire, a person familiar with operations said.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles rose
3.5 cents to a premium of 1.5 cents a gallon against futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:51 p.m. East
Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel in
Los Angeles tumbled 5.5 cents yesterday on refinery selling.  Rich Johnson , a Conoco spokesman at the company’s
headquarters in Houston, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
requesting comment on flaring at the Wilmington refinery. He
declined to comment yesterday on the status of the sulfur unit
at the Rodeo plant.  San Francisco Carbob climbed 0.5 cent to a premium of 3
cents a gallon against gasoline futures.  Motor  gasoline inventories  on the West Coast, known as the
Padd 5 region, dropped 1.2 million barrels, or 3.9 percent, to
29.7 million barrels in the week ended April 13, the Energy
Department said. That’s the lowest level since Dec. 30.  Distillate fuel oil inventories  on the West Coast tumbled
to the lowest level since November, falling by 803,000 barrels,
or 6.2 percent, to 12.2 million, the department said.  CARB diesel in Los Angeles rose 0.75 cent to a premium of
7.25 cents a gallon versus Nymex heating oil futures. The same
fuel in  San Francisco  jumped 3.5 cents to a 10.5-cent premium.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon 
strengthened 1.5 cents to a 3.5-cent premium against gasoline
futures. Low-sulfur diesel  there  rose for the first time in
three days, increasing 1 cent to a premium of 24.5 cents a
gallon versus heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
