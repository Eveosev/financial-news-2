An Australian index of leading
economic indicators advanced in February as gains in stocks and
 money supply  outweighed a decline in dwelling approvals.  The index, a gauge of future economic growth, rose 0.2
percent from a month earlier to 284.2,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and
the Melbourne Institute said in a statement in Sydney today.  Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens signaled this month he
may end a three-month pause in interest-rate cuts as soon as
next month if weaker-than-forecast growth slows inflation. The
central bank lowered  borrowing costs  in November and December,
to 4.25 percent, to buttress the housing market, support jobs
and boost confidence among consumers who are saving more.  Westpac’s leading index tracks eight gauges of activity,
including company profits and productivity, to give an
indication of how the economy will perform over the next three
to nine months. The coincident index, a measure of the current
state of the economy, rose 0.1 percent in February to 271.9, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
