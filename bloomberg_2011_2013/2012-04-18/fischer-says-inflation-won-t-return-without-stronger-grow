Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said inflation won’t significantly accelerate until
economic growth picks up and the jobless rate declines.  “Serious inflation is not likely to return until aggregate
demand strengthens and unemployment rates come down,” Fischer
said in a speech today at the International Monetary Fund in
Washington. He didn’t refer in his comment to a particular
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
