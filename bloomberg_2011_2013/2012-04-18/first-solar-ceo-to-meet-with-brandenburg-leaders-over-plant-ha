First Solar Inc. (FSLR) ’s plan to close a
factory in eastern  Germany  with 1,200 employees has
“surprised” the region’s government, which will meet with
company executives today.  Brandenburg State Governor Matthias Platzeck and state
Economy Minister Ralf Christoffers are due to meet First Solar
Chairman Mike Ahearn and other executives after the company said
yesterday it would shut its module plant in Frankfurt an der
Oder in the fourth quarter, the government said in a  statement .  The state government also formed a working group to
“stabilize the industry location” of Frankfurt an der Oder, it
said. First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona, completed a 170
million-euro ($223 million) expansion there in November that
doubled output capacity to about 560 megawatts of panels a year.  First Solar, the largest maker of thin-film panels, plans
to cut 30 percent of its workforce as a slowdown in European
demand counters expansion in  Asia ’s emerging markets. It cited
reductions to solar subsidies in Germany and Italy for the move.  Four large German solar companies, including  Q-Cells SE (QCE) ,
once the world’s largest maker of solar cells, have filed for
insolvency since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
