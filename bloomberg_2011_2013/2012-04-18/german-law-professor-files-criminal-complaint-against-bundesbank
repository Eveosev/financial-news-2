A German law professor filed a
criminal complaint against the Bundesbank’s board over Target2
imbalances on the central bank’s accounts.  Bernd Schuenemann, based in Munich, asked prosecutors to
investigate whether Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and the
members of the bank’s board are guilty of collaborate
embezzlement, according to a statement published today by the
Foundation for Family Businesses in  Germany  and  Europe , which
supports the complaint.  Brun-Hagen Hennerkes, the foundation’s chairman, said the
complaint is aimed at revealing what potential indirect costs
may arise from imbalances in the euro area’s cross-border
payment system, known as Target2. A Bundesbank spokesperson was
not immediately available to comment.  As capital from crisis-stricken countries like  Greece  and
Italy has sought safety in northern havens such as Germany and
the Netherlands, and banks from southern states have borrowed
cash from the  European Central Bank , imbalances have built up.
While Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Finland have a
net claim on the ECB, countries including Greece, Italy,  Spain 
have net liabilities.  Those imbalances have caused controversy in Germany, where
academics including the Ifo Institute’s Hans-Werner Sinn have
charged that the Target2 system allows the financing of southern
states’ balance-of-payments deficits by the north.  The ECB and the Bundesbank maintain such imbalances are a
natural consequence of the crisis and will diminish once funding
conditions in the euro area return to normal. The claims would
only become an issue if the Eurosystem were to collapse, they
say.  To contact the reporter on this story:
