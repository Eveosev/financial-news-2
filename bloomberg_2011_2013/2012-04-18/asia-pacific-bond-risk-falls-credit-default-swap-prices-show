The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 5 basis points to 161.5 basis
points as of 8:37 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The index is on course to close at its
lowest level since April 5, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index dropped 7.5 basis points
to 153.5 as of 10:08 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The gauge is on track for its biggest one-day
decline since Jan. 19 and has traded between 182.8 and 128.2
this year, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 4 basis points to
169 basis points as of 9:17 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The measure has traded between 194.6 and 136.2 this
year, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
