(Corrects number of bases in headline and first paragraph,
as well as Sapporo and Fukuoka plans in second paragraph. The
story was published on April 17.)  Jetstar Japan Co., the budget
carrier backed by  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  and Japan Airlines Co.,
said it plans to operate two bases in the country as it prepares
to start flights on July 3.  The carrier’s initial hub in Tokyo’s Narita Airport will
“soon” be followed by one in Osaka, Chief Executive Officer
Miyuki Suzuki told reporters in Tokyo today. Destinations from
Osaka’s Kansai airport will include Sapporo and Fukuoka, she
said.  Jetstar Japan also said it will sell 10,000 tickets for 1
yen (1 cent) each as it competes with two other budget carriers
starting flights in the country this year. The airline has said
budget carriers may about triple their share of Japanese  air
travel  to 35 percent by 2020.  The new carrier will compete with two new budget airlines
backed by All Nippon Airways Co. -- Peach Aviation Ltd. and
 AirAsia (AIRA)  Japan Co. -- and  Skymark Airlines Inc. (9204) , the biggest
existing low-fare airline.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and  Century Tokyo Leasing Corp. (8439)  also own
stakes in Jetstar Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
