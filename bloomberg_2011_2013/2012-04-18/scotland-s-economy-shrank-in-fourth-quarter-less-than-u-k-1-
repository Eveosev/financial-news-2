Scotland ’s economy shrank by less
than the U.K. as a whole in the fourth quarter because of an
increase in output from the services industry.  Gross domestic product declined 0.1 percent over the three-
month period and increased 0.5 percent when compared with a year
earlier, the Scottish government in Edinburgh said in an e-
mailed statement today. Services increased 0.2 percent.  In the U.K. economy overall, GDP decreased 0.3 percent in
the quarter, the Office for National Statistics reported on
March 28, as services companies cut output.  Scottish unemployment fell by 12,000, or 0.4 percent,
between December and February, the Scottish government said in a
separate e-mailed statement. It was the biggest drop in
unemployment for more than a year.  Scotland’s unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent in
February. The U.K. rate declined to 8.3 percent in March from
8.4 percent a month earlier, the Office for National Statistics
said in  London  today.  Scotland now has lower unemployment, higher employment and
lower economic inactivity than the U.K. as a whole, Scotland’s
First Minister  Alex Salmond  said in the statement.  Editor:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
