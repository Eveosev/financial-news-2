Allianz SE (ALV) â€™s German life insurance
unit head Maximilian Zimmerer said the interest paid on German
Bunds is too low, making them overvalued, in an interview with
Handelsblatt.  French government bonds are attractive, the future CFO of
Allianz SE said in the interview, though investors should wait
until after the presidential elections, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
