French Socialist challenger
 Francois Hollande  would defeat President  Nicolas Sarkozy  by 56
percent to 44 percent in the May 6 presidential runoff, a BVA
poll held April 16 and 17 showed.  The gap was unchanged from a BVA survey on April 11 and 12.
For the April 22 first round, Sarkozy would get 27.5 percent, up
0.5 percentage point from the previous poll. Hollandeâ€™s score
fell 0.5 point to 29.5 percent, the BVA poll for Orange and RTL
showed.  National Front candidate Marine Le Pen would get 14 percent
of the votes in the first round, ahead of leftist candidate
Jean-Luc Melenchon with 13 percent and self-styled centrist
 Francois Bayrou  with 12 percent.  BVA polled 1,161 registered voters by telephone and
Internet April 16 and 17. The margin of error was plus or minus
2.5 percentage points, BVA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
