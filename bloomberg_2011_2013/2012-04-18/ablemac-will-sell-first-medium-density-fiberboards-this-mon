Tableros y Maderas de Caldas SA 
will start selling the first products from its medium-density
fiberboard plant by the end of this month and plans to use the
factory to help double sales, the company president said.  “We expect the first sales, though they may be small, to
happen at the end of April and then in May for them to be more
stable,” Juan Fernando Vasquez said in a phone interview. “We
have run a little behind schedule.”  With the new medium-density fiberboard plant, the company
plans to double sales from 109 billion pesos ($61.6 million) in
2011 within three years, Vasquez said.  Tablemac, as the company is known, will report quarterly
results next week, according to Vasquez.  The shares have rallied 5.2 percent this year, compared
with a 20 percent advance in the benchmark IGBC Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
