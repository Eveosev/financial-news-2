Gulf Capital, the Abu Dhabi-based
investment company led by former Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette
leveraged buyout executive Karim El Solh, is planning to raise
as much as $750 million to start a third private equity fund.  The firm, which targets controlling stakes in energy,
health-care and education companies, expects to market its GC
Equity Fund III from early next year, El Solh said yesterday in
an interview in  Abu Dhabi . It expects to raise between $550
million and $750 million from investors including Asian
sovereign wealth funds and U.S. financial institutions, he said.  Gulf Capital expects to invest 75 percent of its $553
million GC Equity Fund II by year-end, from about 50 percent
now, allowing it to start marketing a third fund. The firm, set
up in 2005 to attract global investors to the Gulf region,
invests on average $50 million to $75 million in each company.  “We’re big investors in oil and gas and our investments in
defensive sectors like healthcare and education have been
profitable,” he said. “We’d like to continue that investment
strategy. We like to influence our portfolio companies.”  The fund is “exploring options” to exit its investment
in Gulf Marine Services, an assembler and operator of vessels
for the offshore oil and gas industry, including an initial
public offering in London, Singapore or Abu Dhabi, he said.  The firm is also considering a potential IPO for its Metito
Holdings Ltd. power and water business, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
