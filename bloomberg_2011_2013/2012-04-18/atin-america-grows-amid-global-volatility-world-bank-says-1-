Latin American and Caribbean
economies growing 3.5 percent to 4 percent this year and next
will make the region attractive for foreign investors and pose
challenges for policy makers as currencies and prices increase,
the  World Bank  said.  The region will expand at a faster pace than Eastern Europe
and Central Asia and similar to East Asia, bank economists said
today at a briefing in Washington. Foreign investment climbed
eightfold in the first two months of this year from the same
period in 2011, and inflation will average 6.25 percent in 2012,
they said.  Countries including Brazil, Mexico and Colombia have
“healthy” foreign reserve and exchange-rate flexibility to
respond to risks such as a slowdown in Europe, a sluggish
recovery in the U.S., a downturn in  China  or decline in
commodity prices, the bank economists said. Ecuador and
Venezuela are more vulnerable to a spike in  oil prices  and would
benefit from financial reforms, they said.  “The risks are not in how much you are exposed but, more
importantly, in how little policy response capacity you have to
cope with such unpredictability,” said Augusto De la Torre, the
bank’s chief economist for  Latin America  and the Caribbean.
“Several countries in Latin America are exposed to both a
slowdown in U.S.,  Europe  and China and a reduction in commodity
prices and investment. However, since policy makers in these
countries have space to maneuver, their level of vulnerability
remains low.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
