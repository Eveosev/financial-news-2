Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
investors should buy  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  shares, which fell as much as
8.8 percent in the past week, amid a “very big year” for the
world’s biggest company by market value.  Apple will report fiscal second-quarter earnings of $10.18
a share on April 24, Goldman Sachs said in a note to investors
today. That’s higher than a previous estimate of $9.36 and the
average analyst  projection  in a Bloomberg survey of $9.84.
Goldman Sachs also lifted its 2012 projection to $45.76, more
than the average projection of $44.21.  “We expect the company to report another solid quarter,
with particular strength in iPhone and iPad sales, and we’re
raising estimates as a result,” Bill Shope, an analyst at
Goldman Sachs in  New York , wrote in a note today. “We continue
to believe Apple’s shares are very attractive at current levels,
and we’d be buyers ahead of March-quarter results.”  Goldman Sachs boosted its 12-month share-price forecast for
Cupertino, California-based Apple to $750 from $700. Shope has
had a buy rating on the stock since at least December 2010,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple declined 0.2 percent to $608.34 today. The shares
climbed 5.1 percent yesterday, snapping a five-day decline, amid
optimism that the iPhone and iPad will top sales projections
when the company delivers quarterly results next week. Apple
added 51 percent this year through yesterday, about five times
the increase of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Two of the largest technology companies tumbled today after
reporting results.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  posted the slowest sales growth in years as the
European slump weighed on orders last quarter. Intel’s shares
dropped 1.8 percent, while IBM fell 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
