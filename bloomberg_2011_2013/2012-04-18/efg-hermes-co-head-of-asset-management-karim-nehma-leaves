Karim Nehma, co-head of asset
management at  EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO) , left his post at the
biggest publicly traded Arab investment bank, the company’s
website shows.  Kashif Siddiqui is now the sole head of the asset
management division, according to EFG-Hermes’ website, which
removed an earlier reference to Nehma.  Nehma and Siddiqui took over as co-heads of asset
management after former head Hashem Montasser left the bank at
the end of 2010.  An official at the bank declined to comment when contacted
by Bloomberg News. Nehma couldn’t be reached for comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
