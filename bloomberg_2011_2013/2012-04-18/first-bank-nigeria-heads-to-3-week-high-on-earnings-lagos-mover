First Bank of Nigeria Plc , the West
African nation’s third-largest lender by market value, headed
for its strongest close in three weeks on full-year earnings
growth and higher-than-average dividend yield.  The  stock  jumped 4.9 percent to 10.2 naira, on course for
its highest level at the end of trading since March 27, as of
11:53 a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital.  Full-year profit attributable to shareholders rose 47
percent after deposits grew and bad loans declined, First Bank
reported yesterday. Revenue soared 28 percent to 296.32 billion
naira ($1.9 billion).  “We like the performance, which affirms our view on the
prospects of First Bank in the years ahead,” Abiola Rasaq, an
analyst at Vetiva Capital Management Ltd. in Lagos, wrote in a
note to clients today. The proposed dividend of 80 kobo per
share “translates to 8.2 percent yield and it is competitive to
peer average of 7.5 percent,” Rasaq said.  First Bank’s  shares  have jumped 15 percent this year,
compared with a 8 percent rise in the  Bloomberg NSE Banking
Index (NGSEB10) , which tracks the performance of  Nigeria ’s 10 largest
banks by market capitalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
