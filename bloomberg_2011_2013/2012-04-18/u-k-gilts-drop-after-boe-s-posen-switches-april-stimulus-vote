The pound strengthened to a 19-
month high against the euro and gilts dropped after minutes of
the  Bank of England ’s April meeting showed policy maker  Adam Posen  ended his push for further stimulus.  U.K. two-year  yields  climbed to the highest level in four
weeks as central bank officials said inflation may pose more of
a threat than they previously anticipated. Posen joined the
majority of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee in seeking
no change to the 325 billion-pound ($519 billion)  asset-purchase
target , according to minutes of the April 4-5 gathering.
Sterling also advanced versus all 16 of its major peers as a
report showed jobless claims rose less than economists forecast.  Posen’s decision “is a surprise and may reflect a vision
of higher inflation and a touch better growth prospects,” said
 Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “I’m looking for the pound to
trade at 80 pence per euro. Pound-dollar will break through the
highs of the year soon.”  The pound appreciated 0.6 percent to 81.91 pence per euro
at 4:53 p.m. London time after reaching 81.74, the strongest
level since August 2010. Sterling climbed 0.6 percent to
$1.6023, the highest since April 3.  Gilts Fall  The yield on the 10-year gilt rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.13 percent after reaching 2.17
percent. The 4 percent bond maturing in March 2022 declined
0.345, or 3.45 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 116.56.  The two-year yield advanced three basis points to 0.46
percent after rising 0.49 percent, the most since March 21.  The additional yield, or spread, investors demand to hold
10-year gilts over two-year notes was little changed at 167
basis points. The spread is holding above its April 10 low of
162 basis points and will meet resistance should it widen to its
100-day moving average of 174 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Resistance refers to an area on yield charts where orders
to buy a security may be grouped.  Posen joined fellow policy maker  David Miles  in voting at
the central bank’s March meeting to increase the bond-purchase
program by 25 billion pounds to 350 billion pounds. Miles
repeated his vote at April’s meeting, while describing his view
on the need for more as “finely balanced.” The pound weakened
0.2 percent against the euro on Feb. 9 when the Bank of  England 
last announced an increase of asset purchases.  Today’s minutes set the stage for a possible pause in May
when policy makers will consider new quarterly forecasts. Data
yesterday showed U.K. inflation unexpectedly accelerated for the
first time in six months.  Inflation Bets  The 10-year breakeven rate, a gauge of inflation
expectations derived from the yield difference between index-
linked and conventional  government bonds , slipped to 2.78
percentage points after climbing to 2.81, the highest since
April 4.  Policy makers will keep inflation expectations anchored to
the central bank’s 2 percent goal as the pace of price gains
slows less than expected this year, said Bank of England Deputy
Governor  Paul Tucker .  “Inflation might remain above 3 percent throughout the
second quarter of this year, and possibly into the second half
of the year,” he said in a speech today in Liverpool, northwest
England. The pace of consumer-price gains is “uncomfortably
above target,” he said.  U.K.  jobless claims  increased by 3,600 in March to 1.61
million, the  Office for National Statistics  said in  London .
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted a gain of 6,000.
Unemployment as measured by International Labour Organization
methods dropped to 8.3 percent in the quarter through February
from 8.4 percent.  Gilts declined 1.9 percent in the first quarter, the worst
start since 1996, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. They have returned 0.7 this month.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction as much
as 1.35 billion pounds of inflation-linked bonds due in 2029
tomorrow. It will sell bills the following day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
