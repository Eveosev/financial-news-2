Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  rose the most in
eight weeks after Macaubusiness.com said the owner of the Wynn
and Encore casinos may sign a land contract for a proposed
resort in Cotai, Macau, this month.  Wynn  gained  4.4 percent to $130.28 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest jump since Feb. 21. The shares have risen
18 percent this year.  Macaubusiness  cited the  Jornal Tribuna de Macau , which
attributed the information to a source close the deal.  “If this is accurate, this should be viewed very favorably
by investors since it plugs a unit growth/new development
hole,”  Joseph Greff , a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst, wrote in a
research note today. Greff, who rates the Las Vegas-based casino
operator overweight, said the deal could add as much $30 dollars
a share to Wynn.  Michael Weaver, a Wynn spokesman, declined to comment.  Wynn is looking to build its second casino in  Macau , the
only place in  China  where gambling is allowed. The former
Portuguese colony has become the largest gambling market in the
world since it began granting new casino licenses in 2002 to
companies, including Wynn. Wynn Macau opened in 2006.  Wynn shares jumped 4.3 percent March 2 after the company’s
law firm accidentally released a statement saying the new
project had been approved by Chinese authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
