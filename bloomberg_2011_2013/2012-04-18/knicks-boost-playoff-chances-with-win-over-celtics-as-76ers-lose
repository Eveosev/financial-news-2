The  New York Knicks  moved closer to
the National Basketball Association playoffs with a 118-110 win
against the  Boston Celtics  after the Philadelphia 76ers lost
102-97 to the Indiana Pacers.  New York’s ninth win in 13 games, behind a 35-point
performance from Carmelo Anthony, lifted it to 32-29, one game
ahead of the 76ers, who slipped to 31-30 with their seventh
defeat in nine games.  The Knicks are seventh in the Eastern Conference, with
Philadelphia occupying the eighth and final playoff spot. The
Milwaukee Bucks (29-31), who visit the Washington Wizards
tonight, are ninth.  Paul Pierce scored a season-high 43 points for the Celtics
(36-26), who already have clinched a postseason spot. Boston
missed a chance to clinch the Atlantic Division title with the
loss.  New York  now trails Boston by 3 1/2 games in the five-team
standings.  Anthony also had 12 rebounds and 10 assists at Madison
Square Garden last night to log his first triple-double of the
season and second of his career.  Reserves J.R. Smith and Steve Novak had 25 points each as
the Knicks’ bench outscored the Celtics’ non-starters 55-2.  The Knicks and 76ers each have five regular-season games
remaining. Tonight, New York visits the  New Jersey Nets , while
Philadelphia plays the Cleveland Cavaliers.  Amar’e Stoudemire may return for New York against the
Cavaliers on April 20, interim coach  Mike Woodson  told
reporters. Stoudemire injured his back March 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
