Stocks dropped, paring gains from
the biggest European rally since December, as  Intel (INTC)  Corp. and
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)   disappointed  investors
with their quarterly results and bad loans surged in  Spain .
Treasuries rose, and oil fell.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slipped 0.4 percent to
1,385.14 at 4 p.m. New York time while the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  retreated 82.79 points to 13,032.75 as Intel lost 1.8
percent and IBM fell 3.5 percent. The S&P 500  trimmed  its loss
from 0.5 percent as consumer stocks  rallied . The Stoxx Europe
600 Index declined 0.7 percent after adding 2 percent yesterday.
Yields on 10-year Treasuries fell two basis points to 1.98
percent. Crude lost 1.5 percent.  Intel and IBM, two of the computer industry’s bellwethers,
posted the slowest sales growth in years as a European slump
weighed on orders last quarter. Better-than-estimated corporate
earnings have helped fuel the  S&P 500 ’s rally since March 2009.
While profit growth will accelerate to 8.6 percent for all of
2012, income gained 1.7 percent during the first quarter,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We got used to companies beating estimates by a pretty
good margin,” Burt White, who oversees $390 billion as chief
investment officer at LPL Financial Corp. in  Boston , said in a
telephone interview. “While earnings estimates have come down,
the whisper number hasn’t. Companies have a lofty target to
beat. That’s why when you see results like Intel and IBM’s, it
illustrates that the market does have higher expectations than
what consensus is.”  IMF Forecast  Global stocks rose yesterday, giving the S&P 500 its
biggest advance in a month, after higher forecasts from the
 International Monetary Fund  and gains in Spanish bonds
outweighed declines in U.S. housing starts and factory
production. Yesterday’s 1.6 percent increase for the S&P 500
extended its 2012 rally to 11 percent as investors bought stocks
amid better-than-estimated economic and corporate data.  Intel slid today as the world’s largest semiconductor maker
forecast a second-quarter gross margin that was lower than some
analysts predicted. IBM fell after the biggest computer-services
provider had revenue that trailed estimates.  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  gained
3.2 percent after reporting first-quarter sales that topped
estimates.  Qualcomm Inc., among companies that report results today
after U.S. exchanges close, slipped 0.4 percent.  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  sank 24 percent for the largest
slump since August as the life  insurer  and mortgage guarantor
postponed plans for a public offering of its Australian unit
backing home loans after “elevated” losses in the nation.  Spanish Loans  Spanish bonds pared gains, pushing yields on 10-year debt
to 5.82 percent from 5.72 percent earlier today. The nation’s
non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending jumped to
8.16 percent in February, the highest level since 1994, from
less than 1 percent in 2007, the Bank of Spain said today. The
ratio rose from 7.91 percent in January as 3.8 billion euros ($5
billion) of loans soured.  The pound jumped 0.6 percent against the dollar after  Bank
of England  policy makers said inflation may be higher than
forecast. The yield on the 10-year gilt climbed four basis
points to 2.13 percent. The two-year note yield rose as high as
0.49 percent, a level last seen on March 21.  The yen slid 0.5 percent against the dollar and declined
0.4 percent versus the euro. The Swedish krona strengthened
against 15 of 16 major peers after the nation’s central bank
kept its main rate unchanged amid signs the largest Nordic
economy will avoid a recession.  Oil Inventories  Crude fell for the first time in three days, losing 1.5
percent to $102.67 a barrel, after the U.S. Energy Department
said oil inventories rose 3.86 million barrels last week, more
than double the increase forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts. Natural gas futures jumped 0.8 percent, rebounding
from a 10-year low, ahead of a report on stockpiles tomorrow.  Gold futures dropped 0.7 percent, declining for the second
time in three days, as the dollar’s advance curbed demand for
the precious metal as an alternative asset.  To contact the reporter on this story:
