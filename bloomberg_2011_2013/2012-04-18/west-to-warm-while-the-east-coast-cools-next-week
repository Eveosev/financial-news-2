The western U.S. may be warmer than
normal through next week while the East Coast cools down,
forecasters said.  An area including parts of  California  and stretching to
Iowa and Missouri is expected to be 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit
(3.3 to 5.6 Celsius) above normal from April 24 to April 28,
according to  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri.  Temperatures will probably average about 6 degrees below
normal from  New York  to  South Carolina , Salmon said.  Commodities traders watch temperature forecasts to gauge
energy use and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use
gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.  Demand for natural gas from electricity generators peaks in
the summer months to meet air conditioning needs. Power plants
consumed about 31 percent of U.S. gas supplies in 2011,
department data show.  Computer forecast models have been inconsistent for
predictions beyond April 28, wavering between cooler and warmer
outlooks, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  “The complicated pattern situation continues to offer a
curvy road in the expectations game with frequent shifts in
forecast thinking,” Rogers said in a note to clients.  In his 11- to 15-day outlook, Rogers said he expects an
area from the Pacific Northwest to Georgia and South Carolina to
be warmer than normal from April 28 to May 2. The warmest area
may be from eastern Idaho to northern Georgia, where
temperatures are expected to be 5 degrees above normal.  The normal average temperature for April 19 in New York is
about 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12 Celsius), according to MDA
EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It’s 50 in Boston,
51 in Chicago, 59 in  St. Louis , 63 in Atlanta, 64 in Dallas, 70
in Houston, 51 in Seattle and 62 in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
