Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose,
pushing the yield to a 17-month low, on speculation slowing
inflation will prompt the central bank to reduce borrowing costs.
The dong fell by the most in a month.  The monetary authority cut its repurchase rate to 12
percent from 13 percent on April 11 and trimmed its refinancing
and discount rates by a percentage point each. Inflation eased
to a one-year low of 14.15 percent in March, government data
show. Slowing consumer-price gains may allow the nation to cut
borrowing costs by 100 basis points in each of the second, third
and fourth quarters, central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh said
last month.  “Yields are dropping because consumer prices are expected
to increase by as little as 0.1 percent this month” from March,
said Cao Tan Phat, Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at ACB
Securities Co. Prices rose 0.2 percent last month from February.  The  yield  on five-year bonds fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 11.06 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the lowest
level since Nov. 10, 2010.  The dong weakened 0.6 percent to 20,840 per dollar as of
3:03 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the currency’s reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
official fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
