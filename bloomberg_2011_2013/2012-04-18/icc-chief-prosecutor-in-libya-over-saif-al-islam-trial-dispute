The International Criminal Court’s
chief prosecutor arrived today in  Libya  amid a dispute between
the North African nation and the Hague-based court about who
should try deposed leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s son, Saif al-Islam.  ICC chief prosecutor  Luis Moreno-Ocampo  was to meet with
Libyan officials, including National Transitional Council head
Mustafa Abdel Jalil and Justice Minister Ali Ashore, state
television and the Libya News Agency reported. The ICC
prosecutor was to discuss the trial with Libyan officials, the
agency reported.  Libya has rejected calls by the international court to try
Saif al-Islam, who was widely seen as Qaddafi’s heir-apparent,
in the Hague. Instead, Libyan authorities want him tried inside
the country.  Moreno-Ocampo will also discuss with Libyan authorities
reports about torture and other alleged abuses in detention
facilities run by the militias that played a key role in the
civil war that ended Qaddafi’s more than 40-year hold on the oil
rich nation.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
