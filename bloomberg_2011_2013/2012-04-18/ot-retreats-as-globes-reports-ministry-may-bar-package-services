declined for the third time this week as Globes reported
Israelâ€™s Ministry of Communications may bar the second-largest
fixed-line operator from offering a package of its services.  The shares of Hot, a provider of Internet, fixed-line and
cable television, retreated 3.2 percent to 40.91 shekels at
10:36 a.m. in  Tel Aviv .  The ministry will publish its plans for the fixed-line
telecommunications sector today, Globes reported, without saying
how it obtained the information. Yechiel Shabi, a spokesman for
the ministry, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
