GAM Holding AG (GAM) , the Swiss  money
manager  that split from  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , said a market
rebound helped boost client assets by 3.4 percent in the first
quarter.  Assets under management rose to 110.6 billion Swiss francs
($120.7 billion), from 107 billion francs three months earlier,
the Zurich-based company said today in a  statement . The firm
reported a “slight net new money outflow” in the quarter after
clients withdrew 3.8 billion francs last year.  GAM Holding said improved market performance helped
compensate for client outflows. The company, which is buying
back as much as one-fifth of its stock by 2014, posted its first
annual loss in 2011 as clients withdrew money and the firm cut
the value of its stake in  Artio Global Investors Inc. (ART)   “Client activity began to see tentative signs of
recovery,” GAM said in the statement, adding that “risk
appetite remained fragile.”  GAM fell 1.2 percent to 12.75 francs at 9:44 a.m. in Zurich
trading, paring this year’s gain to 25 percent and valuing the
company at 2.5 billion francs.  GAM Holding’s Swiss & Global unit, which sells Julius Baer-
branded funds, posted a 4.7 percent increase in assets to 80.5
billion francs in the quarter amid demand for fixed-income and
equity funds and as customers invested in precious metals
exchange-traded funds.  The rest of the business, known as GAM, reported a 2
percent increase in assets under management even as clients
withdrew money.  Swiss & Global targets annual inflows of 8 percent to 12
percent, while GAM targets new assets of 6 percent to 10
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
