The cup awarded to the Greek winner
of the first competitive marathon at the inaugural modern
 Olympic Games  sold for a record 541,250 pounds ($867,000) today,
outstripping estimates of 120,000 pounds to 160,000 pounds.  The Breal’s Silver Cup was originally presented to runner
Spyros Louis at the Games held in  Athens  from April 6-15, 1896.
Louis, a water carrier, is reputed to have sipped cognac on his
way around the track in the Panathinaiko Stadium.  “Our family has been very proud to have the honor of
looking after this important historical sporting trophy for the
last 116 years,” his grandson, also named Spyros Louis, said in
a press release e-mailed by Christie’s International.  The trophy was bought by the Eleusina, Greece-based  Stavros
Niarchos Foundation . The price set a record for Olympics
memorabilia at auction, beating the previous high of 290,000
euros ($380,000) paid for a 1952 Helsinki torch.  Today’s sale of Olympics memorabilia and vintage posters
raised a total of more than 1.26 million pounds, including the
premium.  (Richard Vines writes for Muse, the arts and culture
