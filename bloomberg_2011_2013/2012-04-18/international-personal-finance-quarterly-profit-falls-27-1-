International Personal Finance Plc (IPF) 
said first-quarter pretax profit fell 27 percent because of
higher costs and weaker exchange rates.  Profit before tax at IPF, which makes unsecured loans to
low-income households in developing markets, declined to 6.1
million pounds ($9.7 million) from 8.3 million pounds in the
year-earlier period, the company said in a statement today.
First-quarter pretax revenue fell to 159.7 million pounds from
160.4 million pounds.  “We have made an encouraging start to the year and are on
track to perform well in 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Gerard Ryan said in the statement. “The result for the quarter
includes the impact of higher rebate costs and weaker foreign
exchange rates, which are in line with previous guidance.”  The shares  rose  4 percent to 245.5 pence at 8:46 a.m. in
 London , giving the company a market value of 631 million pounds.  IPF, based in Leeds, northern England, was spun off from
 Provident Financial Plc (PFG) , the U.K.’s largest subprime lender, in
July 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
