The lira may strengthen while
government debt maturing in one year or less might decline after
 Turkey ’s central bank said it could tighten monetary policy to
pare inflation, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  Today’s announcement by the central bank that it may lend
toward the upper end of its rates corridor of  5.75 percent  to
11.5 percent more often is “clearly positive for the currency
but could hurt short-term Treasury bills,”  Yarkin Cebeci ,
economist for the region at JPMorgan in Istanbul, said in an e-
mailed report to clients today.  “We would expect the effective funding rate to remain
above the 8 percent mark even on normal days while the central
bank is expected to get even more sensitive to the currency
movements and is likely to start additional monetary tightening
whenever the lira starts under-performing,” Cebeci said.  Yields on benchmark bonds maturing in two years rose 5
basis points to 9.47 percent at 4:28 p.m. in Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
