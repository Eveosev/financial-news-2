Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  fell after a surge in bad loans held by Spanish banks
and disappointing earnings reports by  Intel Corp . and
International Business Machines Corp. dimmed the earnings
outlook for Asia’s exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , Japan’s biggest
camera maker that gets 58 percent of its revenue in Europe and
the Americas, dropped 0.5 percent from the closing share price
in Tokyo. ADRs of  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) ,
Australia’s third largest lender, slid 0.2 percent. Shares of
Nippon Sheet Glass Co. may be active after the Japanese
glassmaker said its chief executive quit after clashing with the
board over the company’s strategy.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 9,600 in Chicago yesterday, down from 9,660 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,610 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index slid 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell
0.1 percent in Wellington.  “We are seeing the clear need by the authorities to
address funding concerns for a number of sovereign issues,”
said Tim Schroeders, who helps manage $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “Today we will see prices
consolidate.”  U.S. Earnings  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.1 percent
today. The index dropped 0.4 percent in New York yesterday as
Intel forecast a gross margin that was lower than some analysts
predicted and IBM’s sales missed forecasts.  Share also declined as non-performing loans in Spain as a
proportion of total lending jumped to 8.16 percent in February,
the highest level since 1994, from less than 1 percent in 2007,
the Bank of Spain said yesterday. Spain is selling two- and 10-
year bonds today.  SouFun Holdings Ltd. led Chinese property stocks lower in
New York trading after  home prices  in the nation tumbled. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. was little changed at 102.76 yesterday.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 9.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 10.1 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 5.4 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.2 times for the S&P 500
and 10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
