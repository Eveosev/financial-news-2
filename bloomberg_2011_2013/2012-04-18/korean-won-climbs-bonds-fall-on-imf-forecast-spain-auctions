South Korea ’s won gained for the
first time in three days and bonds slid as the  International
Monetary Fund  raised its global economic growth forecast and
Spain sold more debt than targeted.  The IMF predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year in its
World Economic Outlook yesterday, compared with a January
projection of 3.3 percent. It sees growth of 4.1 percent in 2013,
up from 4 percent. Spain sold 3.18 billion euros ($4.2 billion)
of debt yesterday, compared with the Treasury’s maximum target
of 3 billion euros. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of shares rose 1 percent,
following a 1.6 percent advance in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index yesterday.  “Global stock gains following the revised economic
forecast and  Spain ’s debt auctions will support the won at the
mid-1,130 level,” said Lee Yong Hee, a Seoul-based currency
dealer at the Industrial Bank of Korea.  The won strengthened 0.3 percent to 1,137.20 per dollar at
the close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, slid 40 basis points, or 0.40
percentage point, to 8.28 percent. Currency gains were limited
on speculation overseas investors are repatriating dividends
paid out by South Korean companies, according to Yun Se Min, a
Seoul-based currency trader at Busan Bank.  South Korea’s government will strengthen monitoring and
take timely action to address potential risks the economy faces,
including rising oil prices and  Europe ’s debt crisis, Finance
Minister Bahk Jae Wan said at a meeting today. Woori Finance
Holdings Co., South Korea’s biggest bank holding company by
assets paid dividends today.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 climbed two basis points to 3.49 percent, Korea Exchange
Inc. prices show. Three-year debt futures slid 0.08 to 104.04
and the one-year interest-rate swap advanced two basis points to
3.51 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
