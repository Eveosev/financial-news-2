Spanish  export  growth accelerated
in February, leaving foreign sales the only driver remaining for
the euro region’s fourth-biggest economy as the strictest
austerity push in decades tipped triggered a second  recession 
since 2009.  Exports in February grew 4.9 percent from a year earlier.
That’s a faster pace than the 3.9 percent in January. Still, the
February level is a fraction of the 22.5 percent rate in the
same month last year, the Economy Ministry in  Madrid  said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said
yesterday that “exports might be the only component of output
to increase in 2012.” The government forecasts the economy will
contract 1.7 percent as more than 40 billion euros in austerity
measures cause domestic demand to shrink 4 percent, more than
four times last year’s rate.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s People’s Party government is
aiming to cut the euro area’s fourth-largest  budget gap  to 5.3
percent of gross domestic product this year from 8.5 percent in
2011 to curb the nation’s borrowing costs. The  International
Monetary Fund  forecast yesterday that the shortfall will be 6
percent this year and 5.7 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
