The permanent European rescue fund
should be able to put capital into banks without going through
national governments, an International Monetary Fund official
said.  The European Stability Mechanism, or ESM, needs that access
to “de-link the sovereign and banking risk at the national
level,” Jose Vinals, director of the IMF’s monetary and capital
markets department, said today in an interview on Bloomberg TV’s
“InBusiness With Margaret Brennan.”  Vinals warned against getting “caught into a wave of
pessimism by recent market data” even if the “situation is
uncertain” in countries including Spain and  Italy .  “Perseverance with the right policies at the national
level and at the European level is something that over time
should be rewarded,” he said.  Vinals was speaking ahead of meetings of Group of 20
finance ministers and central bank governors, the IMF and  World
Bank  starting tomorrow in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
