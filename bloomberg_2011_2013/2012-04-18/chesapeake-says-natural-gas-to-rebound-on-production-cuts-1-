U.S.  natural-gas  prices will
rebound as producers reduce drilling and weather normalizes,
according to  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)   “Two-dollar gas prices are not sustainable,” Mike Stice,
chief executive officer of Chesapeake Midstream Partners, said
in an interview at the Flame conference in Amsterdam. “Prices
will rebound. You’ll see a supply impact from these low gas
prices. We had a perfect storm in terms of production and warm
temperatures. It can’t be repeated.”  Chesapeake has been switching shale production to liquids
as as it seeks to survive low gas prices, Stice told delegates
earlier. Shale-gas drilling is being sustained beyond what is
economic by terms that mean leases are extended if they are
productive, he said in the interview.  Gas futures dropped to a 10-year low of $1.94 today on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract has fallen 35 percent
this year, the biggest drop among the 24 members of the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Index of commodities.  Foreign investors are also drilling to delineate the size
of gas reserves, adding to the U.S. glut, he said.  Storage levels will not be this high at the same time next
year, he said. Reserves are 59 percent above the five-year
seasonal average, according to the Energy Department.  Chesapeake plans to continue focusing on opportunities in
the U.S. and won’t look to exploit international resources for
the foreseeable future, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
