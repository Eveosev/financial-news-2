The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt rose, according to BNP
Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed
12.5 basis points to 669.5 at 2:42 p.m. in London. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose five basis points to 142 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 6.5 basis points to 250.5 and
the subordinated index climbed 11 to 409.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
