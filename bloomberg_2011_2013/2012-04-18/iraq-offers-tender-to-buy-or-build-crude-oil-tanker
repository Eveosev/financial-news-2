The Iraqi Oil Tankers Co. offered a
tender for the purchase or the construction of a crude oil
tanker with a capacity of 6,000 metric tons or more.  Companies can submit bids until April 23, according to the
 website  of the state-owned company.  The tanker will be the Iraqi government’s third state-owned
oil transport vessel, as it currently operates two 13,500-ton
tankers bought in 2007 and 2008. Iraq’s fleet of about 15 oil
tankers was destroyed or fell into disrepair since the country’s
war with neighboring  Iran  in the 1980s and subsequent conflicts
in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
