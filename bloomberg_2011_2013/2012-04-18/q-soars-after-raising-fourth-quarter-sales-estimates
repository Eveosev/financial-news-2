THQ Inc. (THQI)  soared the most in more
than two decades after saying it expects to report a smaller
fourth-quarter loss than anticipated, helped by rising sales of
the “Saints Row: The Third”  video game .  The Agoura Hills, California-based company gained 33
percent to 60 cents at 1:40 p.m. in  New York , after earlier
surging as much as 46 percent for the biggest intraday increase
since at least 1991. The shares, which peaked at $36.39 in April
2007, had slumped 90 percent in the past year before today.  THQ is working to save cash by cutting 240 jobs, reducing
executives’ pay and focusing development efforts on new
properties and social games,  Michael Pachter , an analyst with
Wedbush Securities in  Los Angeles , said today in an interview.  “The good news is they know they face a potential cash
crisis, and they’re acting prudently to address it,” said
Pachter, who has a neutral rating on the shares. “Before they
cut prices, they probably were going to run out of money by
Christmas.”  The company expects a  net loss , excluding some items, in
the range of 10 cents to 20 cents a share in the period ended
March 31, compared with a previous forecast for a loss of 35
cents to 50 cents, according to a statement today.  Net sales were $160 million to $170 million, compared with
a prior range of $130 million to $150 million, THQ said.  The company faces a liquidity crisis after its uDraw game
tablet failed to catch on with consumers and it waited too long
to address a growing market for casual games, said Pachter.  “Saints Row” sales rose after THQ in late December
reduced the price of the game to attract buyers, Pachter said.  The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results
on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
