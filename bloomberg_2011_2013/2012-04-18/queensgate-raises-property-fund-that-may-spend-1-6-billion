Queensgate Investments LLP, set up
by Jason Kow and family asset manager  LJ Group , raised a
distressed European real estate fund capable of making as much
as 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) of acquisitions.  Wealthy families pledged 100 million pounds to Luxembourg-
registered Queensgate Investment Fund I and may add another 400
million pounds, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.
The fund will finance at least half of each acquisition with
debt.  Targets will include hotels, properties that generate long-
term rental income and other assets across Europe, it said. Kow
previously headed special situations investing at London &
Regional Properties, the investment company of billionaire
brothers Ian and Richard Livingstone. LJ Group oversees 4
billion pounds of assets for about 200 affluent.  “There is as much as 500 billion euros ($654 billion) of
property debt in  Europe  expiring over the next three years and
regulatory changes such as Basel III create unique buying
opportunities for investors with ready equity who are able to
act rapidly,” Kow said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
