Canadian natural gas rose as
analysts forecast that U.S. stockpiles increased by less than
average last week.  Alberta  gas gained 3.8 percent. U.S. inventories probably
gained 24 billion cubic feet to 2.511 trillion last week, the
median of 20 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year
average increase is 26 billion, according to the Energy
Department, which releases its weekly survey of gas in storage
tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  “We’re seeing a little buying ahead of tomorrow’s
numbers,” said Carl Neill, a consultant with Risk Management
Inc. in Atlanta. “The high levels of storage are keeping a lid
on prices.”  Alberta gas for May delivery rose 5.5 cents to C$1.52 a
gigajoule ($1.45 per million British thermal units) as of 2:40
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 47 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  settled unchanged at a 10-year low of $1.951 per
million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago rose
0.34 cent to $2.031 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas advanced 1.7 cents to $1.8181 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, prices gained 2.85 cents to $1.885.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3 billion cubic
feet, 450 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.27 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.96 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 928 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.73 billion cubic feet today, or 65 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.06
billion cubic feet at 1:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
