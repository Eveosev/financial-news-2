Dry-bulk shipping rates will stay
pressured for the next 12 to 15 months because there are as many
as 30 percent too many vessels, Moody’s Investors Service said.  “Any positive pressure on freight rates is likely to be
offset by the large number of new vessels scheduled for
delivery, exacerbating current oversupply,” Milan-based Marco
Vetulli, Moody’s senior credit officer, said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
