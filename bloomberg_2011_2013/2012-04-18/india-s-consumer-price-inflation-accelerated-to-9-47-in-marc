Indian consumer-price inflation
accelerated in March as the cost of egg, vegetables, fish and
meat products rose, the government said.  The consumer-price index climbed 9.47 percent from a year
earlier, compared with an 8.83 percent advance in February, the
central statistics office said in a statement in New Delhi today.
The gauge was created in January 2011 and today’s release gives
a year-on-year rate for the third time.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  cut interest  rates  yesterday for
the first time since 2009 on slowing growth even as it said
upside risks to inflation were limiting room for further easing.
The country’s benchmark wholesale-price index rose 6.89 percent
in March, slower than the 6.95 percent pace in February.  “An aggressive rate action is ruled out unless growth
falls off the cliff,” Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank
Ltd. in Mumbai, said before today’s report. “Until September,
there may not be any more cut by the Reserve Bank of India.”  She expects  interest rates  to be cut by a further 25 basis
points in the year through March 2013.  The central bank predicts wholesale-price inflation will
probably be at 6.5 percent by the end of the current financial
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
