Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)  will start
operations at its U.S. liquefied natural gas export terminal in
late 2015 after breaking ground in June this year, said Jean
Abiteboul, president of Cheniere Supply & Marketing.  The Houston-based company will make a final investment
decision on the project in May or June, Abiteboul told delegates
at the Flame conference in Amsterdam today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
