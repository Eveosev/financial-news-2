German exports to  Switzerland  rose
to a record last year.  Exports climbed 14.5 percent to 47.7 billion euros ($62.6
billion), the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said in an
e-mailed statement today. While less than the 17.3 percent
increase in 2010, it was more than the 11.4 percent gain in
overall German exports in 2011, the office said. Imports from
Switzerland also reached a record last year, rising 13.4 percent
to 36.9 billion euros.  “The German and Swiss economies are very closely
intertwined,” said  Claude Maurer , an economist at Credit Suisse
Group AG in Zurich. “The strong Swiss franc also helped.”  A stronger franc makes imported German goods cheaper in
Switzerland. In September last year, the Swiss central bank
capped the franc at 1.20 per euro, saying its gains threatened
to hurt exports and stoke deflationary pressures. The German and
Swiss economies expanded 3 percent and 1.9 percent respectively
in 2011.  The imposition of the currency cap “explains why Swiss
export growth to  Germany  did not fall much behind Germany’s
export growth to Switzerland,” said Jan Amrit Poser, chief
economist at Bank Sarasin in Zurich.  The statistics office said German exports of cars and car
parts to Switzerland jumped 27.6 percent last year, while
exports of metals gained 25 percent. German imports of Swiss
pharmaceutical products rose 20.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
