The pound weakened against the
dollar before the  Bank of England  publishes minutes of its
meeting this month, when policy makers kept  interest rates  and
their bond-buying program unchanged.  Government bonds  rose.  Sterling slipped against 10 of its 16 major peers tracked
by Bloomberg. The BOEâ€™s Monetary Policy Committee left its so-
called quantitative-easing program at 325 billion pounds ($517
billion) on April 5, and held its benchmark rate at a record low
0.5 percent. A separate report may show U.K. jobless claims rose
for a 13th consecutive month.  The pound depreciated 0.1 percent to $1.5901 at 8:08 a.m.
London time, and was little changed versus the euro at 82.38
pence. Sterling reached 82.10 pence on April 16, the strongest
level since Sept. 9, 2010.  The yield on the 10-year gilt fell two basis points to 2.08
percent, with the two-year note yield also two basis points
lower, at 0.41 percent.  Sterling has climbed 0.6 percent in the past month, the
best performer after the yen among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar rose 0.2 percent, while the euro lost 0.5 percent,
the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
