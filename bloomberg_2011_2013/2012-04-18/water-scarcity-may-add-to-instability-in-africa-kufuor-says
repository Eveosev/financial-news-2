The worsening problem of water
scarcity may contribute to political instability in sub-Saharan
 Africa , said John Kufuor, the head of a World Bank-affiliated
effort to improve living conditions in poor countries.  “People migrate to find water anywhere if there’s a
scarcity situation,” Kufuor, a former president of Ghana who
now leads the Sanitation and Water for All  partnership , said
today in an interview in  Washington . “People have fought wars
to access water,” he said. The organization includes more than
30 developing countries, the  United Nations  and the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation.  Competition for water in the next decade will fuel
instability in parts of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East
that are important to U.S. national security, according to a
U.S. intelligence report released last month. Nations will be
more likely to use water as a bargaining chip in international
negotiations, according to the report.  Kufuor, 73, received the World Food Prize in 2011 for his
work to alleviate hunger in Ghana, the West African nation that
he led from 2001 to 2009. Water supplies and sanitation
conditions may be more important than food security in poorer
countries partly because of the public-health risks they pose in
growing urban areas, he said.  The sanitation and water partnership meets at the  World
Bank  every two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
