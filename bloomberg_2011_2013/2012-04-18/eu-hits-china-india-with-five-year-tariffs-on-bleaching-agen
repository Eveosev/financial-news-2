The European Union imposed five-
year tariffs against China and  India  on a chemical used for
bleaching to curb competition for Spanish manufacturer  Oxaquim
SA .  The duties of as much as 52.2 percent punish Chinese and
Indian exporters including  Punjab Chemicals and Crop Protection
Ltd.  for selling oxalic acid in the 27-nation EU below cost, a
practice known as  dumping .  Oxaquim, which accounts for more than a quarter of the EU’s
production of oxalic acid, suffered “material injury” as a
result of dumped imports from China and India, the bloc said in
a decision published today in the  Official Journal . The five-
year duties, due to take effect tomorrow, follow provisional
levies introduced six months ago at largely the same rates.  The five-year anti-dumping duties amount to 43.6 percent on
all Indian producers except Punjab Chemicals, which faces a 22.8
percent levy, and Star Oxochem Ltd., which is subject to a 31.5
percent tax, and to 52.2 percent on all Chinese manufacturers
except two including Shandong Fengyuan Group, which faces a 37.7
percent duty.  The only difference under the provisional duties was that
Star Oxochem faced the maximum rate for Indian producers of 43.6
percent. EU importers of oxalic acid made by Star Oxochem over
the past six months will be refunded the difference with the
lower five-year rate for the company.  The trade protection is the outcome of an inquiry that the
EU opened in January 2011 after a dumping complaint by European
chemical industry lobby group  Cefic  on behalf of Oxaquim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
