MRV Engenharia (MRVE3)  & Participacoes SA,
Brazil’s third-biggest homebuilder by revenue, fell the most in
two months after first-quarter sales decreased.  Shares  dropped  5.1 percent to 12.95 at the close in  Sao
Paulo , the steepest one-day drop since Feb. 17. It was the
biggest loser on the BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index, which
advanced 0.4 percent.  First-quarter contracted sales declined 2 percent to 815
million reais ($434 million), compared with the same period last
year, MRV said in a regulatory filing yesterday. New projects
fell 38 percent to 644 million in the quarter, according to the
filing.  The homebuilder’s “weaker-than-expected” preliminary
numbers were “mainly attributable to the company’s focus on the
sale of larger projects, which tend to post a soft sales
performance,” Banco Itau BBA SA analysts David Lawant, Enrico Trotta and Vivian Salomon wrote in a report dated yesterday.
They maintained a recommendation equivalent to a buy.  MRV has gained 21 percent this year, compared with a 15
percent advance for the  BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index. (IMOBBV)   To contact the reporter on this story:
