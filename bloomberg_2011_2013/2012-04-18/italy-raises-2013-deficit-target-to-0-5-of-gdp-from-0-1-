Italy’s government revised its
budget-deficit goal next year to 0.5 percent of gross domestic
product from a previous target of 0.1 percent, the Cabinet said
in an e-mailed statement after a meeting in  Rome .  Italy’s economy will shrink 1.2 percent this year before
expanding 0.5 percent in 2013, said the Cabinet, which approved
the government’s three-year economic plan today. The government
had previously forecast a contraction of between 0.4 percent and
0.5 percent this year.  Public debt, net of bailout contributions to Greece and to
 Europe ’s rescue funds, will amount to 120.3 percent of GDP this
year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
