Douglas Holding AG (DOU)  rose the most in
more than a month in  Frankfurt  as  LVMH (MC)  Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA may be prepared to discuss a deal with the German
perfume and makeup retailer.  Douglas jumped as much as 3.5 percent to 35.39 euros and
traded at 35.34 euros as of 9:22 a.m. LVMH shares fell 1.2
percent to 128.95 euros.  Douglas and LVMH have made preliminary contact, said people
with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. There have been no formal
discussions because Douglas’s Kreke family would prefer to take
the company private and buy out other shareholders with the help
of financial investors, they said.  “A strategic buyer makes sense,” said  Klaus Kraenzle , an
analyst at Silvia Quandt & Cie., in a phone interview. “It
would make it easier to restructure the company in a family
environment. It’s not clear in what direction Douglas wants to
go, but it’s certainly an additional opportunity.”  Talks with BC Partners Holdings Ltd., Apax Partners LLP and
Permira Advisers LLP to delist the company have stumbled
recently amid doubts about the support of Douglas’s two other
biggest shareholders and the performance of the company’s book
unit, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
