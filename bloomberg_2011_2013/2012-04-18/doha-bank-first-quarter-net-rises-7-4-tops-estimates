Doha Bank QSC (DHBK) , a Qatari lender,
posted a better-than-expected 7.4 percent increase in first-
quarter profit amid increased lending.  Net income rose to 390 million ($107 million) riyals from
363 million riyals a year earlier, according to an e-mailed
statement today. Global Investment House’s estimate was for a
profit of 321 million riyals, while Beltone Financial expected
352 million riyals, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  “The bank, given the scale of operations, has achieved a
very high return on average assets,” Abdul Rehman Bin Mohammad
Bin Jabor Al-Thani, managing director of Doha Bank, said in the
statement. This is “a clear demonstration of the effective
utilization of shareholders’ funds and optimum asset-allocation
strategies.”  Qatari bank lending has outpaced deposits amid an upsurge
in public-infrastructure spending on roads, a port, airport, gas
and fertilizer projects. Credit facilities in March rose 32
percent from a year earlier and customer deposits gained 13
percent, c entral bank data show . The emirate, the biggest
exporter of liquefied natural gas, is the world’s richest
country on a per capita basis, according to International
Monetary Fund data.  Doha Bank’s loans and advances rose 13 percent to 29.5
billion riyals and customer deposits in the quarter and
investment accounts increased 12 percent to 31.4 billion riyals,
the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
