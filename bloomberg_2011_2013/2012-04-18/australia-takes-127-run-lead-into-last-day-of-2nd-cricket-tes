Australia  built a 127-run lead over
the West Indies on day four of the second cricket Test in
Trinidad before play was abandoned because of torrential rain.  The touring team reached 73-3 in 30 overs in its second
innings before the umpires called play off at Queen’s Park Oval
in Port of Spain.  Ricky Ponting  was 32 not out with captain
Michael Clarkeon 3.  Only 30.4 overs were possible on day four, lowering the
prospects of either team forcing a victory with one day
remaining. Australia leads the best-of-three series 1-0 after
winning the opening Test by three wickets. The final match in
Dominica starts April 23.  West Indies fast bowler Kemar Roach, who took 5-105 in
Australia’s first-innings 311, added the scalps of David Warner,
 Shane Watson  and Ed Cowan after the home team was dismissed for
257 in the first over of the day.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
