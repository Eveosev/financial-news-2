Indonesia  raised $2.5 billion from
sales of 10- and 30-year dollar bonds, tapping global investors
to spur economic growth for the second time this year after
winning investment-grade ratings.  The government sold $2 billion of debt due in April 2022
yesterday to yield 3.85 percent, or 184 basis points more than
that for similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It also issued $500 million more of 5.25
percent bonds due 2042 at a yield of 4.95 percent, 181 basis
points more than  U.S. debt . The  finance ministry  said the
offerings drew orders totaling $7.9 billion.  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy is taking advantage of
relative borrowing costs close to an eight-month low as the
government plans to spend $53 billion through 2020 building
railways, airports and seaports. Emerging-market debt sales
climbed 33 percent to $335 billion this year, showing demand for
those bonds even as  Europe ’s debt crisis worsened.  “This is a good time to issue given the global low
 interest rates  and strong demand for emerging-market bonds,”
Chia Tse Chern, the Singapore-based co-head of Asian fixed-
income at UOB Asset Management, which oversees the equivalent of
$15 billion of assets, said before the sale. “Demand will be
strong from the U.S. and Europe because of Indonesia’s
investment-grade status.”  Investors in the U.S. and Europe were allocated 34 percent
of the 10-year bonds and 65 percent of the 30-year notes, the
finance ministry said. Indonesian funds bought 23 percent of the
10-year bonds and 9 percent of the longer-dated debt.  Rating Upgrades  Five-year credit-default swap contracts on Indonesia’s debt
dropped four basis points to 167 yesterday, according to CMA,
which compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. The contracts insure debt against non-payment
and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality .  Fitch Ratings  raised Indonesia’s ranking by one level to
BBB- in December, followed by Moody’s Investors Service to Baa3
in January. Both are the lowest investment grades.  Russia  is
rated two levels higher by Moody’s.  Indonesia raised $1.75 billion from the sale of the 30-year
bonds in January, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The bond
yield rose six basis points to 4.99 percent today, according to
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices on Bloomberg. The 10-
year bond sale at 3.85 percent compares with the 4.37 percent
yield on Russia’s 4.5 percent dollar notes due April 2022, 233
basis points more than Treasuries.  Shrinking Spread  The extra yield investors demand to hold Indonesia’s
dollar-denominated securities rather than similar-maturity
Treasuries narrowed 50 basis points this year to 224, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global  index . The spread reached
188 on March 19, the least since Aug. 5, 2011. The average yield
premium for developing nations’ debt was 355 basis points, down
71 this year, according to JPMorgan  indexes .  Indonesia’s dollar debt returned 14 percent in the past
year, the second-best performance in  Asia  after the 17 percent
gain on the notes of the  Philippines , indexes compiled by HSBC
Holdings Plc show.  Manulife Asset Management, which has Asian bond holdings of
about $34 billion, favors holding Indonesia’s rupiah securities
instead of its dollar debt because of the risk that U.S. yields
will rise.  “We definitely like Indonesia,” said Neal Capecci, a
portfolio manager in Hong Kong at Manulife Asset. “We think
Indonesia should be on a path of sovereign upgrades. We prefer
to buy the local sovereigns.”  Economic Growth  Rupiah 10-year bonds yield 6.08 percent, 407 basis points
more than similar-maturity U.S. bonds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. 10-year yield has risen 13 basis
points this year to 2 percent after dropping 142 basis points in
2011.  Economic growth may reach 6.3 percent to 6.7 percent this
year and accelerate to as much as 6.8 percent in 2013, the
central bank said on April 12.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Standard Chartered Plc managed
Indonesia’s debt sales.  To contact the reporters on this story:
