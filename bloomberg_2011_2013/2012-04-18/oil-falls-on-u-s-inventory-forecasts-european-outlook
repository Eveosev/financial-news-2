Crude dropped after the  American
Petroleum Institute  said U.S. inventories rose to a 10-month
high last week amid speculation that a slowing European economy
may reduce demand.  Prices fell as much as 0.6 percent on the report that
supplies rose 3.41 million barrels to 369.3 million in the week
to April 13. The Energy Department may say stockpiles gained 1.8
million, a Bloomberg survey before the 10:30 a.m. release in
Washington showed.  Adam Posen , a Bank of England policy maker,
ended support for more stimulus while bad loans surged in Spain.  “We are waiting for the DOE numbers and the big build that
showed in the API number is weighing on the market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford , Connecticut. “We still have economic concerns coming
out of Europe.”  Crude for May delivery slid 33 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$103.87 a barrel at 9:47 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices have risen 5.1 percent this year.  Brent for June settlement fell $1.12, or 0.9 percent, to
$117.66 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  The European benchmark contract’s  premium  to West Texas
Intermediate for the same month narrowed to as little as $13.06
in intraday trading, the lowest level since Feb. 1. It was at
$13.39 a barrel at 9:48 a.m. in  New York .  10-Month High  An inventory increase to 367 million barrels in the Energy
Department report would leave stockpiles at the highest level
since the week ended June 3. The API report, released after the
close of floor trading yesterday, showed the most supply since
the week ended May 27.  “The market is expecting another build,” said Phil Streible, a Chicago-based commodities broker at RJO Futures.
“We’ve seen inventories move higher in the last few weeks.”  Posen ended his push for further  Bank of England  stimulus,
joining the majority of the nine-member Monetary Policy
Committee in seeking no change to the 325 billion-pound ($517
billion) asset-purchase target, according to minutes of their
April 4-5 meeting published today in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
