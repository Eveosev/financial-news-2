The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities declined 0.3 percent to 676.61 at 5:33 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
declined 0.2 percent to 1,563.8818.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the highest close in two weeks after the
International Monetary Fund boosted its growth outlook and a
Spanish debt sale raised more than planned, easing concern an
economic slowdown will curb crude demand.  Crude for May delivery was at $104.42 a barrel, up 22
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:52 p.m. Singapore time. The contract yesterday gained 1.2
percent to $104.20, the highest close since April 2. Prices are
5.7 percent higher this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures extended their losses after settling at
a 10-year low yesterday on forecasts for above-normal
temperatures that may reduce demand for the heating fuel.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 18 cents to $16.15 a barrel at 12:35 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, narrowed for
the first time in three days. Gasoil swaps for May declined 45
cents, or 0.3 percent, to $131.35 a barrel, PVM said. That’s the
lowest since Feb. 14.  High-sulfur  fuel oil  swaps for May slid $2.25, or 0.3
percent, to $718.75 a metric ton, according to PVM. That’s the
lowest since Feb. 8. Fuel oil was unchanged after rising to
$4.55 a barrel below Dubai crude, PVM data showed. That was the
smallest discount in nine weeks, signaling reduced losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold may climb for the first time in four days in  London  on
concern that further stimulus by central banks will spur demand
for the metal as a protection of wealth.  Bullion for immediate delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1,650.85 an ounce by 9:34 a.m. in London. June-delivery futures
were little changed at $1,651.40 on the Comex in  New York .  BASE METALS  Copper rose for a second day in London on speculation
demand will improve in  China , the biggest global consumer of the
metal.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn may decline for a fourth straight day as a U.S.
government report showed planting in the country was ahead of
the prior five-year average.  Corn for delivery in July fell as much as 0.2 percent to
$6.06 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price
for the most-active contract since March 30. Futures were little
changed at $6.07 at 3:06 p.m. Singapore time.  Soybeans for July delivery lost 0.2 percent to $14.28 a
bushel. Wheat for delivery in the same month gained 0.4 percent
to $6.225 a bushel.  Rubber increased by the most in two months after  Spain  sold
more debt than targeted and the  International Monetary Fund 
raised economic forecasts, easing concerns demand may slow for
the commodity used in tires.  September-delivery rubber advanced as much as 3.2 percent,
the most since Feb. 17, to 312.3 yen a kilogram ($3,839 a metric
ton) before settling at 311.9 yen on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange.  Palm oil prices declined on speculation that the 13 percent
advance since the end of January will deter importers and on
expectations that production may increase this month in
 Malaysia , the second-largest supplier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
