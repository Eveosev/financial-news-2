Cerberus Capital Management LP, the
private-equity firm led by  Stephen Feinberg , said it raised $833
million for a collateralized loan obligation that will support
its lending to small and medium enterprises.  The CLO, known as A5 Funding LP, includes a $300 million
top-rated term note paying 250 basis points more than three-
month London interbank offered rate, the New York-based firm
said in a statement.  “The market environment provides attractive opportunities
for the Cerberus direct lending business,” Kevin Genda, vice
chairman of Cerberus Business Finance said in the statement.
“We expect to have an additional issuance in the coming
months.”  The deal was structured and sold by Natixis which is also
the administrative agent for the CLO. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  Details of the financing are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
