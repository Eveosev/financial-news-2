Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s  Latin America  head
Francisco Aristeguieta, helping Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  with a push to expand in emerging markets, has overhauled
the bank’s leadership team in the region.  Aristeguieta named Juan Bruchou to head a group of seven
South American countries including Argentina and Venezuela, and
Suresh Maharaj for Central America and the Caribbean, according
to a statement today from the New York-based firm. Gustavo Marin
and Bernardo Norena will continue to head Brazil and Colombia,
respectively. All will report to Aristeguieta, who was appointed
head of the region, excluding Mexico, in November.  Pandit, 55, has targeted economies in Latin America and
Asia for growth as he seeks to help Citigroup, the third-biggest
 U.S. bank  by assets, rebound from a revenue slump last year. The
bank boosted  Latin America revenue  at its core businesses by 11
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier as profit fell
3 percent.  “In today’s global economic landscape, emerging markets
and Latin America are increasingly important,” Aristeguieta
said in the statement. “Citi has the largest presence of any
financial institution in the region and is strategically
positioned to support Latin America’s fast-growing economies.”  Aristeguieta will oversee the Chilean market directly,
according to the statement. Bruchou is the country officer for
Citi Argentina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
