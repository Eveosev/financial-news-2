Kim Clijsters  said she’s skipping
the clay-court tennis season, including the  French Open , to
focus on getting fit for Wimbledon and the London Olympics.  The four-time Grand Slam champion’s recovery from a torn
hip muscle is progressing slower than expected and the Belgian
won’t be able to resume training for another three weeks,
according to a statement on her website. The French Open starts
May 27.  “My current physical condition doesn’t allow me to get in
optimal shape for  Roland Garros ,” Clijsters, 28, said in the
 statement . “I cannot wait, however, to begin a long period of
preparation for the grass season, with Wimbledon and the  Olympic
Games  my principal objectives.”  Clijsters, who was injured in Miami last month, plans to
return to the women’s tour at the June 17-23 Unicef Open grass
court event in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. Wimbledon
begins June 25, with the Olympic tennis tournament at the All
England Club starting July 28.  Clijsters has won three major championships since returning
to the women’s tour in 2009 from a two-year break during which
she had a child. She has said this will be her final season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
