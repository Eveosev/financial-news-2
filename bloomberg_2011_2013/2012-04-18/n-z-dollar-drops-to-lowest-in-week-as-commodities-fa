New Zealand ’s dollar fell to a one-
week low versus its U.S. counterpart as raw-materials prices
decreased, damping demand for currencies of commodity-exporting
nations.  The currency, nicknamed the kiwi, slid against all of its
16 most-traded counterparts except  Brazil ’s real before data
today that may show consumer prices rose at the slowest annual
rate in almost two years. The kiwi and Australia’s dollar
weakened as the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
 tumbled  1.1 percent, its biggest loss in more than a week.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.6 percent to 81.59 U.S. cents
yesterday in  New York  and touched 81.46 cents, its weakest level
since April 11. The kiwi slipped 0.1 percent to 66.30 yen.  The Aussie dollar depreciated 0.3 percent $1.0359. It was
0.2 percent stronger against the yen at 84.17.  Statistics New Zealand  may report that the nation’s
consumer price index increased 0.5 percent in the first quarter,
compared with a 0.3 percent decline in the previous three-month
period, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. Prices probably rose 1.6 percent from  a year
earlier , the slowest annual pace since September 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
