New Zealand ’s dollar traded 0.4
percent from a one-week low after data showed consumer prices 
rose at the slowest annual rate in a year and a half.  The so-called kiwi remained lower following a decline
yesterday on speculation the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand will
refrain from raising its benchmark lending rate for longer. New
Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to receive
floating rates, slipped to 2.895 percent, a level unseen since
Feb. 16. The Australian dollar stayed lower after dropping
yesterday as raw material prices slid, reducing demand for the
currencies of commodity exporters.  “With consumer prices at these levels, it’s unlikely the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand will increase interest rates any
time soon,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, a senior analyst in  Tokyo  at
Ueda Harlow Ltd., which provides currency margin-trading
services.  New Zealand’s dollar was at 81.77 U.S. cents at 9:52 a.m.
in Sydney from 81.59 yesterday in  New York , when it touched
81.46 cents, its weakest level since April 11. The kiwi bought
66.45 yen from 66.30.  The Aussie dollar traded at $1.0379 from $1.0359 yesterday,
when it fell 0.3 percent. It was at 84.39 yen from 84.17.  New Zealand’s  consumer price index  increased 1.6 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, the country’s statistics
bureau said today in Wellington. That was the slowest annual
pace since the third quarter of 2010 and matched the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Prices rose
0.5 percent over the previous quarter, also in line with
forecasts.  Swaps traders are betting the RBNZ will lift  interest rates 
by 11 basis points over the next year, according to a Credit
Suisse Group AG  index. (CRY)  That’s less than the 36 basis points of
increases indicated on March 22. The central bank’s benchmark is
at 2.5 percent, a record low.  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials fell 1
percent yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
