South Korea ’s won led gains in
Asian currencies after the  International Monetary Fund  raised
its estimate for global economic growth and a successful bond
auction in Spain tempered concern about Europe’s debt crisis.  The won rose for the first time in three days after the IMF
predicted an expansion of 3.5 percent for this year in its World
Economic Outlook published yesterday, up from a January
projection of 3.3 percent. The MSCI  Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  Index of shares
gained 1 percent after Spain sold more debt than planned at an
auction and a report showed German investor confidence improved.
India’s rupee fell, approaching a three-month low.  “Asian currencies got a boost as the pessimistic mood in
the market regarding  Europe ’s situation was corrected a bit,”
said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian and emerging-
markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo .  The won strengthened 0.3 percent to 1,137.20 per dollar in
 Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Singapore’s
dollar advanced 0.1 percent to S$1.2498 while the rupee weakened
0.2 percent to 51.5660.  The IMF forecast yesterday the world economy will grow 4.1
percent in 2013, compared with an earlier estimate of 4 percent.
Spain sold 3.18 billion euros ($4.2 billion) of bonds yesterday,
compared with its maximum target of 3 billion euros.  “Global stock gains following the revised economic
forecast and Spain’s debt auctions will support the won,” said
Lee Yong Hee, a Seoul-based currency dealer at the  Industrial
Bank of Korea. (024110)   Indonesia Debt Sale  Indonesia’s rupiah traded at 9,180 per dollar, halting a
two-day slide. The government raised $2.5 billion selling 10-
and 30-year dollar-denominated bonds yesterday. The sale
attracted $7.9 billion in bids, the finance ministry said.  The central bank is shifting its policy focus to managing
consumer-price gains, Perry Warjiyo, director of economic
research and monetary policy, said yesterday.  “Bank Indonesia’s statement will have a positive effect on
the rupiah as it reassures foreign investors,” said Klara
Pramesti, a treasury analyst at PT Bank Negara Indonesia in
Jakarta. “The successful bond auction boosts appetite for
riskier local assets.”  The rupee weakened for the second time this week on
speculation the nation’s refiners stepped up dollar purchases to
pay for costlier crude-oil imports. The commodity gained 1.5
percent this week in  New York  to $104.39 per barrel.  Oil Imports  Crude  imports  by  India , which buys abroad almost 80 percent
of the oil it uses, averaged $12.7 billion in the first two
months of this year, compared with $10.2 billion in the last
quarter of 2011, according to government data.  “We are seeing dollar-demand from oil importers,” said
Vikas Babu, a trader at state-run Andhra Bank in Mumbai. “There
are inflows as well, but insufficient to offset demand.”  China ’s yuan traded at 6.3029 per dollar in Shanghai,
compared with 6.3015 yesterday, according to China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The central bank fixed the exchange rate
0.08 percent lower at 6.2948. A government report today showed
the nation’s home prices fell last month in 37 of 70 cities.  “I’m quite surprised to see a weaker fixing today despite
the stronger market across Asia,” said Stella Lee, president of
Success Futures & Foreign Exchange Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “China
may want to show a wider band doesn’t mean more room for one-way
appreciation bets. Investors are concerned about the magnitude
of China’s economic slowdown as investment keeps falling.”  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht and Malaysia’s ringgit were
little changed at 30.80 per dollar and 3.0630, respectively. The
Philippine peso was at 42.655, compared with 42.650 yesterday.
Vietnam’s dong weakened 0.6 percent to 20,840.  To contact the reporters on this story:
