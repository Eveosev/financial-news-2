Disqualified Egyptian presidential
hopeful Khairat el-Shater, the former second-in-command of the
Muslim Brotherhood, said the exclusion of candidates from the
May election was a crime against the country.  El-Shater told a press conference in Cairo today that the
head of the election commission should be dismissed, and said
there were indications the country’s ruling generals don’t
“have a serious or genuine intention for a real  power
transfer .”  “This is not the real change that the revolution wants,
and that the people have erupted for,” el-Shater said. “We are
seeing a clear attempt to reproduce the old tyrannical regime,
even if in a different form. This is the main danger.”  The Brotherhood has called for a rally on April 20 to
defend the revolution, referring to the uprising that ousted
former President  Hosni Mubarak  in February last year. The ruling
military council has set a June 30 deadline to hand over power
to an elected government.  Ten prospective candidates were excluded from the May 23
election, including el-Shater, Salafi cleric Hazem Abou Ismail
and Mubarak’s longtime intelligence chief  Omar Suleiman , who
also served as vice president in the ousted ruler’s final days.
The ban was confirmed by the election commission yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
