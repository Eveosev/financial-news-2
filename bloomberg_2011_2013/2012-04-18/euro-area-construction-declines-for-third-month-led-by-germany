European  construction output 
dropped for a third month in February, led by declines in
Germany and Italy.  Construction in the 17-nation euro region plunged 7.1
percent from January, when it slipped a revised 0.5 percent, the

From a year earlier,  output  fell 12.9 percent.  German builders’ output plummeted 17.1 percent after a 4.7
percent gain in January, according to today’s report. In Italy
and France, output declined 9.9 percent and 0.4 percent,
respectively. Spanish output dropped 1.5 percent.  The statistics office had previously reported a monthly
drop of 0.8 percent in January. Ireland and Greece are among
