Taiwan ’s five-year bond yield held
near a five-month high as electricity price increases stoked
inflation concerns. The local dollar was little changed.  Taiwan Power Co., the island’s only electricity retailer,
said last week it will raise prices for the first time in more
than three years after posting losses on rising fuel costs.
Consumer prices rose 1.21 percent in March from a year earlier,
after a 0.23 percent increase the previous month, government
data show. The  overnight interbank lending  rate reached 0.488
percent yesterday, the highest level since January 2009.  “People are concerned about inflation and in reaction the
central bank is letting the overnight rate rise more,” said
George Pu, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Sinopac
Securities Corp. “Yields may continue to go up.”  The yield on the government’s 1 percent securities due
January 2017 was little changed at 1.046 percent, according to
Gretai Securities Market. Benchmark  five-year  rates touched
1.052 percent yesterday, the highest level since Nov. 4, and
could test 1.1 percent within a month, Pu forecast.  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.546 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders
use to price options, fell 30 basis points to 3.7 percent.  The overnight  money-market  was little changed at 0.484
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
