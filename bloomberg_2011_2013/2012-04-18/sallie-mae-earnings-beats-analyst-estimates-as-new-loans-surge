SLM Corp. (SLM) , the student lender known
as Sallie Mae, reported first-quarter profit that exceeded
analystsâ€™ estimates as loan originations rose and losses on
soured debt dropped to the lowest since 2008.  Net income fell to $112 million, or 21 cents per share, for
the three months ended March 31, from $175 million, or 32 cents,
a year earlier, the Newark, Delaware-based company said today in
a statement distributed by  Business Wire . Excluding items such
as the market gains and losses of derivatives contracts,
earnings climbed 9.2 percent to $284 million, or 55 cents per
share. On that basis, seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had
estimated an average of 51 cents.  SLM is boosting private loan originations after legislation
passed in 2010 cut companies out of the market for government-
guaranteed lending.  Sallie Mae  made $1.2 billion in education
loans in the first quarter, up from $940 million in the year-ago
period, according to the statement. The lender is forecasting
$3.2 billion of originations in 2012.  The charge-off rate, or the percentage of bad loans that
have been written off, fell to 2.96 percent, the lowest since
the third quarter of 2008, from 3.94 percent a year earlier, the
company said. The proportion of payments more than 90 days late
fell to 4.4 percent, compared with 5.1 percent a year ago.  The rate is falling even as concern mounts that student-
loan bills are ballooning. The U.S. educational debt has reached
$1 trillion, according to the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
