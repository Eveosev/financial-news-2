Romanian opposition parties filed a
no-confidence motion against the two-month-old Cabinet of Prime
Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu to force early elections.  The Social Democrats and Liberals, who formed an alliance
before elections this year, accuse Ungureanu’s government of
“abuse” in the sale of state-owned assets and the approval of
money transfers to local authorities, said Victor Ponta, the
head of the  Social Democratic Party , today in Bucharest.  The ruling coalition is counting on its majority in the
460-member Parliament, which helped former Prime Minister Emil Boc survive seven no-confidence votes since adopting austerity
measures in 2010 to meet pledges to the  International Monetary
Fund  and the European Union. Boc resigned on Feb. 6 as protests
over public-wage cuts and tax increases turned violent.  “The motion has no chance of passing,” Sever Voinescu, a
ruling party spokesman, said yesterday. “The coalition
lawmakers will boycott the vote.”  The opposition lacks 14 votes for passage, according to
Ponta, saying it will be “a miracle” if any coalition
lawmakers cross over to help oust the government.  The government is backed by the Democrat-Liberal Party, the
ethnic Hungarians, known as UDMR, the independents’ party and
the minorities, which hold 237 seats in Parliament.  Ponta said the motion also criticizes a law establishing a
Hungarian-teaching faculty at the University of Medicine and
Pharmacy in the city of Targu-Mures, citing political pressures
from the junior coalition member UDMR.  To contact the reporter on this story:
