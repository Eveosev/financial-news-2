(Corrects to say incident occurred near Tonkolili mine in
first paragraph.)  One person was killed and eight
injured about 15 kilometers from  African Minerals Ltd. (AMI) ’s
Tonkolili iron-ore mine in northern  Sierra Leone  in a protest
over salaries, Ibrahim Conteh of the Bumbuna Government Hospital
said.  “Police have been firing all over the town of Bumbuna
since yesterday,” Conteh said by phone from Tonkolili today.  Residents from the mining community have joined striking
workers to block roads leading to the mine, police Inspector
Ibrahim Kamara, operations officer for the Sierra Leone Police
in Tonkolili, said in by phone today.  There is no official record of casualties, Kamara said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
