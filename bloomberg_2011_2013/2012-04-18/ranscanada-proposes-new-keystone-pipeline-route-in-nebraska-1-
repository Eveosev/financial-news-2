TransCanada Corp. (TRP) , the company
seeking to build a pipeline to ship crude from Canada’s oil
sands to Texas, submitted new proposed routes in Nebraska for
its Keystone XL line.  The plan was submitted today to the Nebraska Department of
Environmental Quality, Shawn Howard, a spokesman for Calgary-
based TransCanada, said today during a telephone interview.  In January, U.S. President  Barack Obama  rejected a
TransCanada proposal over concerns about the pipeline’s path
through environmentally sensitive parts of Nebraska.  The company said in February it would reapply for a permit
to build Keystone. TransCanada’s submittal of alternative routes
is the first step in winning approval for the project in
Nebraska. TransCanada will also need federal approval.  “Nebraska will move forward on the review process of the
proposed Keystone XL pipeline and any future pipelines that will
create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on Middle Eastern oil,”
Nebraska Governor David Heineman, a Republican, said yesterday
in a statement posted on the governor’s website.  Heineman called the review a “top priority.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
