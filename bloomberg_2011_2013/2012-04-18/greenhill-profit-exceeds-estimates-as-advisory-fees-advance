Greenhill & Co. (GHL) , the New York-based
advisory firm founded by Robert Greenhill, reported first-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ expectations as fees from
overseeing deals climbed by 51 percent.  Net income was $16.1 million, or 53 cents a share, compared
with a net loss of $1.58 million, or 5 cents, a year earlier,
the firm said today in a statement after the close of trading in
 New York . The  average estimate  of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was 38 cents.  Greenhill, run by Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok,
advised on $12.4 billion in announced and completed deals in the
first quarter, an 11-fold surge from $1.11 billion a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Advisory
revenue rose to $73.3 million from $48.5 million a year earlier.  “We feel like the year got off to a decent start,” Bok
said today on a conference call following results. “Our revenue
opportunity for the full year is weighted toward the second half
given the low level of deal announcements in recent months.”  Greenhill fell 54 cents, or 1.4 percent, to close at
$38.32. The shares have gained 5.4 percent this year.  The jump in advisory fees, which Greenhill said was driven
by an increase in the “scale and number of completed
assignments,” helped fuel a 71 percent surge in total revenue
to $82.7 million.  Compensation costs grew to $41.2 million, or 50 percent of
revenue, from $36.2 million, or 75 percent, a year earlier. The
firm is seeing a “surge” in recruiting opportunities and could
add at least five senior bankers in the “near term,” Bok said
on the call.  Greenhill last month hired Vikram Gandhi, previously the
global head of the financial institutions group at Credit Suisse
Group AG, as a senior adviser to expand the firm’s business in
India and  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
