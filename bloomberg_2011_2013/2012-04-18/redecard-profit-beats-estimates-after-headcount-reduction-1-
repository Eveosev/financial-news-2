Redecard SA (RDCD3) , the Brazilian card-
payment processor that  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4)  is seeking to
buy out, said its first-quarter profit rose 36 percent, beating
estimates, after the company cut costs by reducing headcount.  Adjusted net income , which excludes some items, advanced to
381.2 million reais ($202.9 million) from 281.3 million reais a
year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. The result was above the  mean estimate  of
367.1 million reais in a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts.  Operating costs declined 3.5 percent to 134.8 million reais
as the company its workforce to 952 employees from 1,054 at the
end of 2011, following the reorganization led by Chief Executive
Officer Claudio Yamaguti, the company said in the statement.  “We expect the company to maintain its expenses at lower
level,” Francisco Kops and Rafael Ferraz, analysts at Banco J.
Safra in  Sao Paulo , wrote in a note to clients on April 17. They
expected the bank to report net income of 367.8 million reais.  The combined value of credit-and debit-card transactions
increased 12 percent to 57.7 billion reais, and total cost of
services fell 0.6 percent to 246.4 million reais.  Itau, which owns 50 percent of Redecard, offered to pay 35
reais a share, or 11.8 billion reais, to purchase the rest of
the card-payment processor Feb. 7. The Sao Paulo-based lender
expects to hold an auction to buy out the lender between July
and August, Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal said in a
conference call April 16.  Redecard  fell  0.4 percent to close at 32.43 reais in Sao
Paulo today. The shares have gained 11 percent this year,
compared with a 26 percent jump for its biggest rival  Cielo SA. (CIEL3)   To contact the reporter on this story:
