U.S.  Gulf Coast  crude premiums fell
for a third day against the benchmark West Texas Intermediate
after the Energy Department said the region’s oil inventories
rose to a seven-month high and refineries used less of the fuel.  Crude oil stocks  on the Gulf Coast climbed for the sixth
week, by 885,000 barrels to 180 million, the highest level since
Sept. 2, the Energy Department said today.  Refinery utilization 
rates in the region slipped for the second week to 83.7 percent,
the agency said.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
dropped $1.10 to $17 a barrel at 12:42 p.m. New York time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
lost $1.50 to a $16.25-a-barrel premium versus spot WTI prices.  “Across the board, we’re seeing inventory increases of
crude,”  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston, said in a telephone interview. “Refinery utilization
is also down, so that’s probably created a temporary glut of
crude on the Gulf Coast.”  Thunder Horse ’s premium narrowed 95 cents to $13.35 a
barrel above WTI, and Mars Blend slipped 70 cents to a premium
of $9.30.  Poseidon’s premium decreased 85 cents to $8.25, and
Southern Green Canyon’s narrowed 35 cents to $8.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed for the second
day, by 40 cents to $16.60 a barrel, the highest level for the
crude since January. Syncrude strengthened $1.20 to a discount
of 80 cents a barrel versus WTI, also the highest level for the
fuel since January.  Bakken oil’s  discount was unchanged at $7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
