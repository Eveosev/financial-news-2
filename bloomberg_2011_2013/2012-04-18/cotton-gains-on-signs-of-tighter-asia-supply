Cotton futures jumped to a two-week
high on signs of slumping production in  China , the world’s
biggest grower and consumer.  Orange juice  fell.  China’s cotton output is likely to drop below 6 million
metric tons in the year starting Aug. 1 amid low prices and high
input costs, Zhu Gang, a researcher at the China Academy of
Social Science, said in an online webcast today. The country
will produce 8.04 million tons in the current season, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said April 10. The fiber has plunged
59 percent from a record $2.197 a pound reached on March 7,
2011.  The smaller Chinese crop “is rather supportive,” to
prices, Sterling Smith, a market analyst with  Country Hedging , a
brokerage in  St. Paul ,  Minnesota , said in an e-mail.  Cotton for July delivery jumped 2 percent to settle at
90.02 cents at 2:33 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Earlier, the commodity climbed by the exchange limit of 4 cents
to 92.25 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since
April 4.  Inventories in India, the second-biggest grower, may sink
to the lowest in eight years as record exports deplete reserves,
according to A.B. Joshi, the nation’s textile commissioner. The
country’s shipments may surge 47 percent to 11.5 million bales
in the year ending Sept. 30 from the previous season, he said.
An Indian bale weighs 170 kilograms.  In the week ended April 10, money managers boosted their
bets on price declines to 2,561 futures and options from a net-
long position, or wagers on a rally, of 7,296 a week earlier,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.  The drop in  India ’s stockpiles “has the shorts’
attention,” Peter Egli, a Chicago-based director of risk
management at Plexus Cotton Ltd., said in an e-mail.  “China remains an enigma, because they keep importing
cotton at a pretty good clip, so maybe the government there
knows that output next season will be a lot less,” Egli said.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery slid 1 percent to
$1.4565 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
