South African inflation slowed to 6
percent in March as food prices eased, adding to expectations
that the  Reserve Bank  will keep its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged.  The inflation rate fell from 6.1 percent in February,
Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa  said on its website
today. That was in line with the median estimate of 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices rose 1.1 percent in the
month.  “The surprise to our forecast was the moderation in food
inflation,” Gina Schoeman, an economist at  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) ,
said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg today. “This
certainly is going to help the Reserve Bank feel more
comfortable about current policy rates. We could see a rate hike
a little later than expected.”  The central bank has kept the benchmark repurchase rate at
5.5 percent, the lowest level in more than three decades, since
November 2010 to help support growth in  Africa ’s largest
economy. Inflation, which exceeded the bank’s 3 percent to 6
percent target for four consecutive months until February, will
probably peak at 6.5 percent in the second quarter, Governor
Gill Marcus said on March 29.  Inflation eased last month as food prices rose at a slower
pace of 8.9 percent from 10.1 percent in February, the
statistics office said.  Consumer prices may pick up again after the government
increased the cost of gasoline by 6.3 percent in April.  The rand fell to 7.8195 per dollar as of 11:22 a.m. in
Johannesburg from 7.8091 before the data was released. The yield
on the benchmark rand bond due in 2015 dropped five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.46 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
