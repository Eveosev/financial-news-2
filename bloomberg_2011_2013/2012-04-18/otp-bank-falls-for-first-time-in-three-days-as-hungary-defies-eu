OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s biggest
lender, fell for the first time in three days as the government
failed to allay all the European Central Bank’s concerns in a
dispute that’s holding up talks about a bailout deal.  The shares declined 1.8 percent to 3,460 forint by 10:39
a.m. in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock index dropped 0.3
percent to 17,547.71.  The Economy Ministry submitted amendments to the central
bank law to parliament late yesterday. The government said they
didn’t remove all the issues blocking the start of bailout
talks, five months after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  requested
aid from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.  “The central bank situation remains a point of conflict
for the EU/IMF talks, so foreign investors may again regard this
as a delaying tactic,”  Akos Kuti , an analyst at Budapest-based
broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., and colleagues wrote in a
research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
