Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the
world’s largest custody bank, will face eight lawsuits claiming
it defrauded clients in foreign-exchange transactions in a
consolidated proceeding in federal court in  Manhattan .  In complaints previously filed in New York, California and
Pennsylvania, BNY Mellon is accused of overcharging investors,
including public pension funds, more than $1.5 billion through
foreign-currency trades. BNY Mellon requested the consolidation.  “We find that these eight actions involve common questions
of fact, and that the centralization” of the complaints will
“serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote
the just and efficient conduct of the litigation,” judges
serving on a panel for multidistrict litigation wrote in an
order yesterday.  The case is In Re  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  Foreign
Exchange Transactions Litigation, 12-md-02335, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
