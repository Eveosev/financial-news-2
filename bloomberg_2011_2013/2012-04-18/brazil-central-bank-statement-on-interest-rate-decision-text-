Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “The Copom considers that, at this moment, the risks for
the inflation trajectory remain limited. The committee also
notes that, until now, given the fragility of the global
economy, the contribution of the external sector has been
disinflationary.  Given this, and continuing the adjustment process of
monetary conditions, the Copom decided, by a unanimous vote, to
reduce the Selic rate to 9 percent per year, without bias.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
