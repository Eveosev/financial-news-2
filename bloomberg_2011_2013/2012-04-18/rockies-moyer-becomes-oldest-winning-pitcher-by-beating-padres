Jamie Moyer held the  San Diego
Padres  to six hits and two unearned runs over seven innings last
night as the Colorado Rockies player became the oldest winning
pitcher in Major League Baseball history.  Moyer, aged 49 years and 150 days, is 80 days older than
Brooklyn Dodgers hurler Jack Quinn was when he defeated the  St.
Louis Cardinals  in September 1932. The left-hander was leading
3-2 when he left the game and the Rockies held on to win 5-3.  Moyer (1-2) threw 89 pitches, none of which was faster
than 79 miles per hour, according to Major League Baseball’s
website. He has played in 689 games for  Texas ,  St. Louis , 
Baltimore, Boston, Seattle and Philadelphia since his first
appearance for the  Chicago Cubs  in June 1986. The
Sellersville, Pennsylvania native said he was more interested in
getting the Rockies victory than in setting the record.  “For me to put that in front of the game really would be
unfair to my teammates, unfair to myself,” Moyer said in
comments on the  MLB.com  website. “It would tell me also that my
focus and my attention were in the wrong place.”  Moyer’s wife and seven of his eight children were at the
game last night in Denver’s Coors Field. Moyer missed all of
last season after a July 2010 injury needed surgery. He joined
the Rockies on a minor league contract before spring training.  The victory also tied Moyer with former Baltimore pitcher
Jim Palmer with 268 career wins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
