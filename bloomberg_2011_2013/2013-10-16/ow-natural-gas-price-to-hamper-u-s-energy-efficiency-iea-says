Low natural gas prices will hamper
the U.S.’s incentive to continue spending on energy-efficiency
projects, according to the  International Energy Agency .  Cheaper prices “make it more difficult to sustain and
increase ratepayer spending levels as consumers see the energy
efficiency surcharge on bills growing even as commodity costs
are going down,” the Paris-based adviser to 28 developed
nations said today in an e-mailed  report . “This combination
could create opposition by some utilities and regulators.”  While the amount of energy used in the U.S. per $1,000 of
economic output fell 4.8 percent last year, it was still 15
percent above the group’s average, according to the IEA.
Programs will combine to more than triple energy savings to 2020
from 2011 levels, making the U.S. one of the most efficient of
IEA members, it said.  “Having accomplished a solid decade of often double-digit
growth, U.S.  energy-efficiency  markets have grown from a
footnote to a force to be reckoned with,” the IEA said. “Since
U.S. energy-efficiency markets derive largely from federal and
state policies, they are particularly vulnerable to political
and economic developments.”  Next-month gas on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange fell to
an average of $2.83 per million British thermal units last year,
down from $4.03 in 2011. The mean cost in the U.K.,  Europe ’s
biggest market, was the equivalent of $9.48 in 2012 on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  The U.S. needed 0.158 metric tons of oil equivalent energy
per $1,000 of economic output last year, down from 0.1657 tons
in 2011, according to the IEA. That compares with 2011 usage of
0.117 tons in the EU and 0.266 tons in  China .  Oil Imports  Improved efficiency and increased domestic crude production
will cut U.S. oil imports by almost 50 percent by the end of the
decade, the IEA said.  In China, the “complex” administrative system and a
diverse array of targets including energy efficiency, carbon
intensity and renewable generation present challenges to
lawmakers, the agency said.  Efficiency measures saved the equivalent of 570 million
tons of oil equivalent, worth $420 billion, in 11 nations from
2005 though 2010, according to the report. Without those
measures, consumers in the member countries would be using about
two-thirds more energy than currently, it said.  Energy efficiency around the world drew investment of as
much as $300 billion in 2011, a level on par with global
investments in renewable energy or fossil-fuel power generation,
the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
