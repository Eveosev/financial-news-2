President Esther George, who has opposed Fed stimulus this year,
said dissenting views representing regional differences and
criticism of the central bank bolster its trustworthiness.  “In a democracy, no institution, including the central
bank, should be immune from criticism,” George said today in a
speech in  Oklahoma City , Oklahoma. “The Federal Reserve is not
a monolithic organization, and such feedback -- both from
outside and inside the organization -- ensures that the Fed
remains accountable to the public it serves.”  George, in her first year as a Federal Open Market
Committee voter, has dissented at every meeting against
continuing monthly purchases of $40 billion in mortgage-backed
securities and $45 billion in Treasuries, saying record stimulus
may destabilize financial markets and push up long-term
inflation expectations.  George didn’t comment on the  U.S. economy  or monetary
policy in her prepared remarks. She was speaking at an event at
the Oklahoma History Center marking the role of the state’s
Senator Robert Owen in the founding of the  Federal Reserve
System  100 years ago.  “The decentralized and representative structure that Owen
envisioned for the nation’s central bank remains a durable
feature of the institution and offers an effective way to
support the U.S. economy,” she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
