Mattel Inc. (MAT) , the world’s largest
toymaker, posted third-quarter earnings that topped analysts’
estimates as sales of Barbie and American Girl gained.  Net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 16
percent to $422.8 million, or $1.21 a share, from $365.9
million, or $1.04, the El Segundo, California-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts expected $1.12 a share, according
to eight estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Third-quarter earnings
included a tax benefit of 5 cents a share, Mattel said.  Chief Executive Officer Bryan Stockton has been trying to
boost sales amid lackluster growth of the toy industry in the
U.S., the company’s largest market, as kids spend more time
using electronic devices. Many toymakers, including Mattel, have
tried making products that incorporate devices such as Apple
Inc.’s iPod with little success.  Stockton also has invested in Mattel’s technology
infrastructure and top brands such as American Girl as a way to
increase sales.  Sales rose 6 percent to $2.21 billion from $2.08 billion a
year ago. Analysts estimated $2.18 billion. Revenue from Barbie,
its largest brand, rose 3 percent.  Mattel dropped 0.9 percent to $41.55 yesterday in  New York .
The shares have increased 13 percent this year, compared with a
19 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
