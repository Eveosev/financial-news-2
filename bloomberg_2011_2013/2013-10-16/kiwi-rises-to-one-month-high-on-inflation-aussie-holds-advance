New Zealand ’s dollar rose to a one-month high after data showed inflation accelerated at the
fastest pace in two years, fanning speculation the central bank
will raise borrowing costs.  Two-year interest rate swaps reached the highest since 2011
as traders are almost certain that the  Reserve Bank  of New
Zealand will raise the official cash rate from 2.5 percent by
June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Australian
dollar held a five-day gain after meeting minutes yesterday from
the nation’s central bank showed that policy makers refrained
from saying a weaker currency would help the economy.  “Because of the resilient economy and inflation
concerns,” markets are expecting a rate increase in New
Zealand, said Kengo Suzuki, the chief currency strategist in
 Tokyo  at Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-biggest
financial group by market value. “New Zealand is almost the
only developed country with a rate increase coming into sight,
so the kiwi is likely to remain strong.”  New Zealand’s currency climbed 0.3 percent to 84.04 U.S.
cents as of 11:14 a.m. Sydney time after reaching 84.08, the
strongest since Sept. 19. The Aussie dollar advanced 0.1 percent
to 95.39 U.S. cents after strengthening 1.1 percent in the five
days through yesterday.  New Zealand’s two-year interest rate swap touched 3.62
percent, the highest since August 2011. Consumer prices in the
South Pacific nation rose 0.9 percent in the third quarter, the
fastest pace of inflation since the period ended June 2011, the
statistics bureau said today.  Australia ’s three-year bond yield climbed two basis points
to 3.178 percent, after touching 3.179 percent, the most since
April 2012. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Demand for higher-yielding currencies increased as Senate
leaders resumed talks aimed at avoiding a U.S. default and
ending the government shutdown after the Republican-controlled
House scrapped a vote yesterday on its plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
