Iron ore prices are at risk of
falling this quarter if a seasonal cut in steel production rates
occurs, with prices to extend declines into next year amid
surging global supply, according to  UBS AG. (UBSN)   “Beyond the risk of a seasonal pullback in output –-
prompting an ore price correction –- we have a modestly bearish
outlook for prices,” analysts including Andreas Bokkenheuser
wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Prices will average $106 a ton in 2014 and $95 in 2015 from
$123 this year, according to the report. UBS had previously
projected a correction in the third quarter.  Iron ore entered a bull market in July as users in  China 
replenished  stockpiles  that shrank in March to the lowest level
since 2009. Macquarie Group Ltd. expects prices to push higher
to the end of the year amid Chinese restocking while Citigroup
Inc. said last month it is bearish in the short-term. Rio Tinto
Group reported yesterday record third-quarter iron ore output
and its expansion in  Australia ’s Pilbara region to 360 million
tons from 290 million tons is under way.  UBS bank forecasts a global seaborne surplus of 154 million
tons in 2014 from 24 million tons this year as production at
Australian mines increases.  Iron ore  with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin rose 0.4 percent to $133.60 a ton yesterday, the
highest since Sept. 26, according to The Steel Index Ltd. Prices
have rallied 21 percent from this year’s low on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
