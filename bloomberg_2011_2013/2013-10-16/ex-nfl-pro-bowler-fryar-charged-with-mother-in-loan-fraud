Ex-Pro Bowl receiver Irving Fryar
and his mother were charged with conspiring to use fraudulent
 home equity loans  to steal $690,000, New Jersey acting Attorney
General John Hoffman said.  Fryar, 51, now a high school football coach, and his
mother, Allene McGhee, 72, were indicted by a Trenton grand jury
on charges of conspiracy and theft by deception, Hoffman said in
a statement. They allegedly deceived five banks in obtaining
loans in December 2009, each of which was secured by McGhee’s
house.  “This is not a case in which Mr. Fryar and his mother
simply omitted or misstated information on loan applications,”
Hoffman said. “They engaged in an elaborate criminal scheme
that was designed to defraud these banks.”  Fryar played 17 seasons in the  National Football League ,
from 1984 to 2000, after being selected by the  New England
Patriots  with the first pick in the 1984 draft. He played nine
seasons with the Patriots, then three each with the Miami
Dolphins and  Philadelphia Eagles  before spending two years on
the  Washington Redskins .  A five-time Pro Bowl selection, Fryar finished his NFL
career with 851 receptions for 12,785 yards and 84 touchdowns.  He ranks among the NFL’s top 20 in all three categories.  Only one wide receiver has been selected No. 1 in the  NFL
draft  since Fryar -- Keyshawn Johnson in 1996.  Fryar has a 1-4 record in his first season as the head
varsity football coach at Robbinsville High School in New
Jersey. He’s also pastor of the New Jerusalem House of God,
which he founded in 2003 in his hometown of Mount Holly.  Fryar and his mother face as many as 10 years in prison. A
call to Fryar at the church wasn’t immediately returned.  The indictment was handed up by a state grand jury in
Trenton in Mercer County. The case has been assigned to be heard
in the courthouse in Mount Holly in Burlington County, according
to Hoffman.  The case is  New Jersey  v. McGhee, 13-10-197-S, Superior
Court of New Jersey (Trenton).  To contact the reporters on this story:
