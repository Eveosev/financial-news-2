Daiwa Lease Co., a unit of  Daiwa
House Industry Co. (1925) , will develop and operate a 20-megawatt solar
power station in Japan’s western prefecture of Wakayama.  Daiwa House will construct the plant while Daiwa Service
Co. will provide maintenance services, the three companies, all
based in Osaka, said in a statement yesterday.  The plant will cost about 6 billion yen ($61 million) to
build, according to the statement.  Construction will start in June 2014, the companies said.
Daiwa Lease will sell solar power to  Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503) 
for 20 years from April 2016 under Japan’s incentive program for
clean energy known as feed-in tariffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
