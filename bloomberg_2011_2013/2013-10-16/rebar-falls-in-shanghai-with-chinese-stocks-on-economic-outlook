Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell as Chinese stocks dropped the most in three weeks
on concern the nation’s economy is losing momentum.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell by as much as 0.7 percent to 3,581  yuan  ($587) a
metric ton before trading at 3,586 yuan at 10:35 a.m. local
time. Prices have dropped 10 percent this year.  Chinese  stocks  slumped, led by metal and technology
companies, after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its rating on the
nation’s equities to underweight. The government is scheduled to
publish third-quarter gross domestic product data on Oct. 18.  Bulk commodities including steel,  iron ore  and coal are
particularly sensitive to the future direction of the economy,
said Zheng Ge, an analyst at Wanda Futures Co. in Beijing.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port gained 0.4
percent on Oct. 14 to $133.60 a dry ton, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  The spot price of rebar was little changed at 3,520 yuan a
ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
