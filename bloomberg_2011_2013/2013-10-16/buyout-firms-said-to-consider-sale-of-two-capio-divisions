The private-equity owners of Swedish
hospital operator Capio AB are considering the sale of the
group’s U.K. and German operations, said three people with
knowledge of the matter.  Nordic Capital and  Apax Partners  LLP, the owners of the
Gothenburg, Sweden-based company, have held discussions with
Rothschild, the Paris-based merger adviser, about seeking buyers
for the units, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the talks are private.  Nordic and Apax bought Capio, which has 11,000 employees in
Sweden,  Norway , France,  Germany  and the U.K., according to its
website, for 17 billion kronor ($2.6 billion) in 2006. Its
Spanish unit, Capio Sanidad SL, was sold in 2011 for an
undisclosed sum, while the company raised 190 million euros
($256 million) of new debt in May.  Apax Europe Funds owns 45 percent of the group, while
Nordic Capital Fund VI has 44 percent and Apax  France  Funds 11
percent, according to Capio’s website. Apax France, which shares
historical ties with Apax Partners, is a separate company.  Officials at London-based Apax Partners, Apax France,
Capio, Stockholm-based Nordic Capital and Rothschild either
declined to comment or didn’t immediately respond to requests
for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
