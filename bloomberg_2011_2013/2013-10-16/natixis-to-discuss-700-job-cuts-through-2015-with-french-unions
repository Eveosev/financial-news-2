Natixis (KN)  SA, the corporate- and
investment-banking unit of  France ’s second-largest lender by
branches, plans to eliminate about 700 jobs by the end of 2015.  The cuts will come mostly through “internal mobility” and
without forced departures, the Paris-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Natixis will discuss the plans with
labor unions in mid November, it said.  Natixis on Oct. 14 met union representatives to share
“staff forecasts for the different business lines until the end
of 2015, both in France and globally,” the company said. The
workforce should remain “stable” at about 15,500 worldwide, it
said. The proposals exclude its credit-insurance unit, Coface
SA.  Natixis is scheduled to provide details on its strategic
plan on Nov. 14, the company has said. The bank this year made
an exceptional 2 billion-euro ($2.71 billion) dividend payment
to shareholders after selling back its holdings in French
regional banks Banques Populaires and Caisses d’Epargne, its
parents.  The planned job losses were reported yesterday by French
daily Les Echos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
