Rubber retreated from the highest
level in more than two weeks as the deadlined loomed for U.S.
lawmakers to reach a deal on raising the debt limit and avoiding
a default.  The contract for March delivery dropped as much as 1.2
percent to 267.5 yen a kilogram ($2,715 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange and was at 268.6 yen at 11:09 a.m. in
Tokyo. The most-active contract ended at 270.8 yen yesterday,
the highest settlement since Sept. 26. Prices have fallen 11
percent this year.  Crude oil traded near a three-month low while  Fitch Ratings 
put the U.S. on watch for a possible credit downgrade yesterday,
citing lawmakers’ inability to forge a deal while reiterating
that it expects the debt ceiling to be raised.  “Weak crude oil prices and concerns over the U.S. debt
problems affect the rubber market,” Ryuta Imazeki, analyst at
Okachi & Co., said by phone from Tokyo.  Rubber inventories in Qingdao,  China ’s main hub for the
commodity, fell to 259,600 tons yesterday, from 271,300 tons at
end of September, the Qingdao International Rubber Exchange says
in an e-mailed report yesterday.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 1.8 percent to 20,800  yuan  ($3,409) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 1.3 percent to 80.8 baht ($2.58) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
