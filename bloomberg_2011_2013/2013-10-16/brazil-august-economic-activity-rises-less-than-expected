Brazil’s  economic activity  in August
rose less than expected, signaling a continued uneven recovery
in the world’s second-biggest emerging market.  The seasonally adjusted economic activity index, a proxy
for gross domestic product, rose 0.08 percent in August from the
previous month after falling a revised 0.34 percent in July, the
central bank said today in a report posted on its website.
Analysts expected a 0.2 percent gain, according to the median
estimate of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The index posted a 1.32 percent increase from the year
before, lower than the 1.5 percent median estimate from 25
economists.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government is working to spark
economic activity undermined by stagnant  confidence  and
inflation that persists above the center of the target range.
Brazil last week increased the key rate to 9.50 percent and
since April has raised borrowing costs the most in the world in
a bid to slow price increases seen curbing purchasing power. The
real touched a nearly five-year low in August, prompting policy
makers last month to raise their 2014 inflation expectations and
warn that fast price increases reduce potential growth.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015, the most
traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 10.33 percent at 9:01 local time. The real
strengthened 0.3 percent to 2.1713 per  U.S. dollar , and has
weakened 5.5 percent this year.  Tightening Cycle  The central bank has boosted the Selic by 225 basis points
so far this year, outpacing  Indonesia ’s 1.5 percentage point
increase in the same period for the world’s biggest tightening
cycle. The remaining 47 major economies tracked by Bloomberg
have either cut or held borrowing costs steady from last year’s
rates.  Annual inflation  in September slowed to 5.86 percent after
breaching the 6.5 percent upper limit of the tolerance range
twice this year. Economists in a weekly central bank survey
forecast inflation will accelerate to 5.95 percent next year.
The bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two
percentage points.  While  Brazil ’s retail sales in August topped economists
forecast for the second straight month, industrial output
unexpectedly stalled on slower consumer goods production. Gross
domestic product growth has trailed analyst estimates in five of
the past six quarters.  The central bank in September reduced its 2013 growth
forecast to 2.5 percent from 2.7 percent, after the economy grew
0.9 percent last year. Policy makers also increased their 2014
year-end inflation estimate to 5.7 percent from 5.2 percent,
basing their call on a year-end Selic at 9.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
