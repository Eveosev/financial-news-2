Colombia and  Venezuela  will today
sign an accord to link oil pipelines in an area bordering the
countries, Colombia’s Foreign Minister said.  The agreement will join the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline,
owned by Colombia’s state-controlled oil producer  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,
with  Petroleos de Venezuela SA ’s Guafita pipeline, Maria Angela Holguin said today in remarks distributed by the Foreign
Ministry’s press office. The accord will give Colombia more ways
to export crude produced in its eastern plains, she said.  The Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline has been attacked a number
of times by rebel groups in recent weeks. An explosion Oct. 5
halted transportation of oil to Colombia’s Caribbean coast,
Bogota-based Ecopetrol said Oct. 7.  Colombia’s largest rebel group, The Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, is currently engaged in peace talks
with the Colombian government in  Havana .  To contact the reporters on this story:
