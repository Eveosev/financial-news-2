Madison Square  Garden (MSG)  Co. signed a
multiyear marketing agreement with Major Energy, making the
closely held company the first official gas and electric energy
partner of the  New York Knicks .  Details of the agreement weren’t disclosed by MSG or
Orangeburg, New York-based Major Energy, which was founded in
2005 and, according to spokesman Mark Berger, has “several
hundred thousand” customers. He wasn’t more specific.  Major Energy will have, among other things, courtside signs
and promotion on the scoreboard at Madison Square Garden during
all Knicks games.  “Aligning with one of the most premier sports franchises
in the world, right here in the heart of our hometown of  New
York City , enables us to bring our story and brand value to the
mainstream,” Eliott Wolbrom, Major Energy’s director of
marketing, said in a statement.  MSG, which also owns hockey’s  New York  Rangers, recently
completed a privately funded, $1 billion renovation of its
namesake arena in midtown Manhattan.  As part of the agreement, fans who sign up for Major
Energy’s service will receive a discount that’s tied to the
number of Knicks’ home wins this season. For example, if the
Knicks win 30 home games this season, those customers will get a
30 percent rebate on their highest energy bill of the year.  The Knicks play 41 regular-season home games. Their season
begins Oct. 30 at MSG against the  Milwaukee Bucks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
