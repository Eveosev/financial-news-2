Vale SA, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, said it’s getting ready to start its $3.5 billion
Carajas Additional 40 Mtpy project in  Brazil  as it expands
production of the steelmaking raw material.  The Rio de Janeiro-based miner expects to get the
operational license for the project this month, Paulo Horta, the
company’s North Ferrous Director, told reporters during a visit
to the iron-ore complex in the Northern state of Para yesterday.  Vale is investing $34 billion on approved iron-ore mining
and logistics projects, seeking to boost its output capacity by
50 percent to 450 million metric tons by 2018, head of Ferrous &
Strategy Jose Carlos Martins said Oct. 7. The company is
developing the Serra Sul mine and logistics venture in Carajas,
the world’s largest iron-ore complex, which at almost $20
billion is the industry’s most expensive project.  The $3.48 billion Carajas Additional 40 Mtpy project was 95
percent complete and scheduled to start operations during the
second half of this year, Vale said Aug. 7. The project consists
of the construction of an iron-ore dry processing plant, which
will have an estimated nominal output capacity of 40 million
metric tons a year, it said.  Vale  has dropped  21 percent this year, compared with a 8.2
percent decline for Brazil’s benchmark Ibovespa  index . The stock
rose 0.3 percent to 32.31 reais at the close in  Sao Paulo  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
