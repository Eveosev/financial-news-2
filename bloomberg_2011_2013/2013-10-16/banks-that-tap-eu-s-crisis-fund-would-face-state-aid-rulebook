Struggling euro area  banks  that
receive aid from a planned central fund for stabilizing stricken
lenders would be forced to pay it back if they don’t adhere to
conditions set by the European Commission, as part of draft
plans being weighed by EU nations.  Moves to access the fund seen by  Michel Barnier , the EU’s
financial services chief, as an essential part of a single
resolution system for failing banks, would be subject to vetting
by the European Commission’s competition enforcement arm,
according to amended plans published on the  EU’s website .  “The commission shall adopt a separate decision on the
compatibility of the use of the fund with the internal market,”
and could impose conditions to minimize any advantages the bank
gains over rivals as a result of the support, according to the
updated plans by  Lithuania , which holds the rotating presidency
of the EU. The commission would have the power to order recovery
of “the misused amounts,” should a lender stray from what was
agreed.  Finance ministers yesterday grappled with how to to put in
place backstops for the resolution system, which is part of a
broader project by EU leaders to build a banking union that
breaks the links between lenders and sovereigns. While
governments have set themselves a year-end deadline for reaching
an agreement on the plans, progress has been hampered by German-led warnings that parts of the blueprint would be illegal.  National officials will discuss the plans at a two-day
meeting starting Oct. 17, according to the  EU website .  Barnier’s proposal requires approval by governments and by
the European Parliament before it can take effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
