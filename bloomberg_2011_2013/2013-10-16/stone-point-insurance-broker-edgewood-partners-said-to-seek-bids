 Edgewood Partners Holdings LLC, a
property and casualty insurance broker backed by Stone Point
Capital LLC, is exploring a sale, said people familiar with
matter.  Edgewood is working with  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  to solicit
offers, according to the people, who asked not to be named
because the process is private. The  San Mateo , California-based
company, which operates under the Epic brand, may fetch as much
as $200 million, one person said.  A sale of Edgewood would add to the more than $6 billion in
U.S. insurance broker takeovers in 2013, more than triple the
amount in the same period a year earlier. Apax Partners LLP, for
example, closed the sale this month of broker Hub International
Ltd. to Hellman & Friedman LLC for $4.4 billion.  John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman for Bank of America,
declined to comment. Nicolas Zerbib, a senior principal with
Stone Point, and Dan Francis, Edgewood’s chief executive
officer, didn’t return calls seeking comment.  Stone Point, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based firm focused on
investments in the financial-services industry, first invested
in Edgewood in 2007, according to Stone Point’s  website. 
Edgewood has 12 offices and generates more than $80 million in
annual revenue, its  website  shows. Its goal is to more than
double revenue in five years and to expand nationwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
