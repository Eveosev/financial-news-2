Palm oil  advanced for the first time
in three days after data showed that shipments increased from
Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for delivery in December advanced as much as
0.7 percent to 2,379 ringgit ($750) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, and was at 2,376 ringgit by the midday
break. Palm for physical delivery in November was at 2,380
ringgit today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Exports from Malaysia gained 6.6 percent to 781,043 tons in
the first 15 days of October from the same period a month
earlier, surveyor Intertek said today. Demand from India, the
biggest importer, may have increased because of the Diwali
festival on Nov. 3, according to Mumbai-based Commtrendz Risk
Management Services Pvt.  “We’re seeing possible festival demand from India,” said
Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Commtrendz. “Palm is the
preferred choice of oil, especially in the festival season.”  Soybeans for delivery in November were little changed at
$12.6825 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while  soybean
oil  for December climbed 0.6 percent to 40.90 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery was little changed at
5,678  yuan  ($931) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange and
soybean oil for May delivery was unchanged at 7,074 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
