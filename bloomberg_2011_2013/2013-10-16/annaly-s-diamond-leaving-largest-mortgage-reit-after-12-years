Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NLY) ’s
Jeremy “Jay” Diamond said he is leaving the largest real-estate investment trust that buys mortgage debt.  Diamond said today in an e-mail he has resigned from the
New York-based company, calling it his “happy home for the past
12 years.” He had been a managing director and its head of
research and corporate communications, according to its  website .
Before joining the firm, he was president of Grant’s Financial
Publishing, publisher of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer.  Annaly owned $102 billion of assets as of June 30. The
company’s  shares  fell 9.6 percent this year through yesterday,
assuming reinvested dividends, after concern that the  Federal
Reserve  would reduce its bond buying roiled credit markets.  Willa Sheridan, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
