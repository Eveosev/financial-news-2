Below-normal temperatures are
expected to grip the central and eastern U.S. as October ends,
said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda, Maryland.  Temperatures may be 8 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 Celsius)
lower than usual in the northern Great Plains and Midwest from
Oct. 26 to Oct. 30, Rogers said today. Readings are expected to
be 3 to 5 degrees below normal from the  Rocky Mountains  into  New
England , an area including Chicago, New York and Dallas.  A blocking pattern over Alaska “looks to drive a series of
progressively stronger early-season cold pushes into the mid-continent starting next week,” Rogers said.  Below-normal temperatures tend to increase energy
consumption as people turn up thermostats to heat homes and
businesses. Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S.
natural gas demand, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm. About
49 percent of all homes use the fuel for heating.  Temperatures are expected to be below normal across the
central U.S., including Chicago and Dallas, from Oct. 21 to 25.  The normal average temperature in New York for Oct. 24 is
about 55 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 52; in  St. Louis , 57;
Dallas, 65; Chicago, 50; and in Burbank, California, it’s 65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
