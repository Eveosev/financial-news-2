Sociedad General de Aguas de
Barcelona SA, controlled by  France ’s  Suez Environnement Co. (SEV) ,
filed an environmental study to deliver desalinated water to
towns in  Chile ’s northern Atacama desert.  Agbar, as the company is known, plans to spend $300 million
on a desalination plant and pipelines to towns in the region,
according to a  filing  with Chile’s regulator today.  Barrick Gold Corp., CAP SA and Teck Resources Ltd. are
developing developing copper, gold and iron-ore mines in the
Atacama, boosting water needs in the area. Agbar operates Aguas
Andinas SA in Chile, which provides water to the residents of
the capital Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
