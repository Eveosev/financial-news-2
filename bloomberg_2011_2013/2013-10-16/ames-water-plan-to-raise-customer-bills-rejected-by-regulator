Thames Water Utilities Ltd.’s plan
to raise customer bills by about 8 percent a year was rejected
by Ofwat, the U.K.’s water regulator, as too high.  The plan to charge an extra 29 pounds ($46) a year isn’t
justified, Ofwat said in a  statement  on its website, instead
proposing an increase of 7 pounds. Thames Water may submit new
evidence before Ofwat makes a final decision in November.  The utility, which has 14 million customers in the London
area, wants to raise bills to help it buy land to build its 4.1
billion-pound Thames Tideway Tunnel, a sewer project that would
follow the course of the capital’s river.  The company, a unit of Kemble Water Holdings Ltd., said on
Aug. 12 it expected to spend about 273 million pounds on land.  Ofwat said last month it would challenge the request as the
company underspent on sewer-flood and sewage-treatment works and
failed to sufficiently maintain parts of its wastewater network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
