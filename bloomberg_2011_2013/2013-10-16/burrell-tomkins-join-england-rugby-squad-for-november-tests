England  rugby coach  Stuart Lancaster 
added four players to the 34-man squad that will face  Australia ,
Argentina and world champion New Zealand next month.  A trio of centers -- Northampton’s Luther Burrell, Joel
Tomkins of Saracens and Gloucester’s Henry Trinder -- may make
their senior debuts as Lancaster prepares to play without
injured regulars Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt.  Flanker  Tom Johnson , who has five Test appearances, was the
only addition in the forwards. The Exeter player replaces  Tom Croft  who is also out through injury.  “As a coaching group we have watched a lot of rugby and we
are pleased with the form of the squad,” Lancaster said in an
e-mailed statement. “Inevitably there have been some injuries
and there is still a big European weekend ahead, but injures
always create opportunities.”  Alex Corbisiero is questionable for the tests after picking
up a knee injury, Lancaster said. He will be monitored during a
two-week rehabilitation program before a final decision on
whether he can participate.  England plays Australia Nov. 2, Argentina Nov. 9 and  New
Zealand  Nov. 16. The All Blacks haven’t lost a match since their
surprise 38-21 defeat by England last December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
