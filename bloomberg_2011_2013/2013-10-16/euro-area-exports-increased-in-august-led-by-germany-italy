Euro-area exports increased in
August, led by Germany and Italy, as the currency bloc’s
economic recovery gained momentum.  Exports from the 17-nation  euro zone  rose a seasonally
adjusted 1 percent from July, when they fell 1.5 percent, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Shipments from Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, increased 1.1
percent. The euro-area  trade surplus  widened to 12.3 billion
euros ($16.7 billion).  The European Central Bank forecasts that the euro-area
economy will contract 0.4 percent this year and return to 1
percent growth in 2014. ECB President  Mario Draghi  on Oct. 2
reaffirmed his pledge to keep key interest rates “at present or
lower levels for an extended period of time,” based in part on
“the broad-based weakness in the economy.”  Shipments from Italy and Spain increased 0.8 percent and
0.7 percent in August, respectively, while French exports dipped
0.1 percent. Exports from the 28-nation European Union rose 0.3
percent in August after a 0.8 percent decline a month earlier,
today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
