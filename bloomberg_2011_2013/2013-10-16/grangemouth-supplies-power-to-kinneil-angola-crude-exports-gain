The  North Sea  Kinneil oil and gas
processing plant, which handles crude from the BP Plc-operated
Forties Pipeline System, is still getting steam and power from
Grangemouth even after the refinery at the site was shut,
according to Ineos Group Holdings SA.  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will export
56 crude cargoes in December, three more than in November, a
revised loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.
Russian Urals blend traded in northwest  Europe  at a bigger
discount than yesterday’s offered level.  North Sea  There were no bids, offers or trades for Forties, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window. Lot F1101 for Nov. 1 to Nov. 3 traded
yesterday at 25 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent.  Statoil ASA (STL)  briefly offered Oseberg cargoes for Oct. 31 to
Nov. 2 loading at 75 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent before
withdrawing it, according to the survey.  Brent for November settlement traded at $110.87 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $110.48 from the previous session. The December
contract was at $110.52, a discount of 35 cents to November.  A power station at Grangemouth remains in operation and is
supplying steam and electricity to the Kinneil oil and gas
processing plant,  Richard Longden , a spokesman for Ineos, said
by phone at 4:45 p.m. London time.  The Forties Pipeline System is scheduled to load 387,000
barrels a day of crude in October, according to a shipping
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Ineos said it will keep the Grangemouth refinery and
petrochemical site closed even after the Unite union called off
a strike planned for this weekend, potentially cutting 45
percent of U.K.’s oil output.  Urals/Mediterranean  Glencore Xstrata Plc sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals to
Statoil for Oct. 28 to Nov. 1 loading at a discount of $1.95 a
barrel to Dated Brent delivered to Rotterdam, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window.  The grade was offered at discounts of $1.65 a barrel by  Eni
SpA (ENI)  and BP.  Russia plans to ship 1.01 million metric tons of Urals from
the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk on Oct. 31 to Nov. 6, according
to a preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.
Four 100,000 ton lots will be loaded from Ust-Luga from Oct. 31
to Nov. 4, the plan showed.  Exports from Novorossiysk are planned at two 140,000-ton
cargoes and four 80,000-ton shipments of Urals from Oct. 31 to
Nov. 6, according to the program.  West Africa  BP offered an Angolan Pazflor cargo for Nov. 4 to Nov. 5 at
a discount of $2.40 a barrel to Dated Brent, the Platts survey
showed.  Angola crude shipments will total 53.54 million barrels, or
1.73 million barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares with
50.88 million, or 1.7 million a day, in November. Most
consignments are of 950,000 to 1 million barrels.  An extra Plutonio cargo was added to the December schedule,
according to the revised plan.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, bought a
cargo of Nigerian Qua Iboe crude for December delivery to its
Cilacap refinery, said a company official who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  To contact the reporters on this story:
