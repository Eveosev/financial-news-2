House Speaker  John Boehner  will
allow a vote on a Senate agreement to end the government
shutdown and extend U.S. borrowing authority, said
Representative  Kevin Brady  of Texas, a senior House Republican.  “The speaker will bring that agreement to the House floor
in a very timely manner,” Brady said on Bloomberg Television
today. He said he thinks the measure would pass.  House leaders haven’t decided whether they will vote before
the Senate, said a Republican aide who spoke on conditions of
anonymity. For procedural reasons, if the House goes first, the
bill could reach President Barack Obama’s desk more quickly.  To contact the reporters on this story:
