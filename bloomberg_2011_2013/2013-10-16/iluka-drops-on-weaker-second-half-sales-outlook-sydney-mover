Iluka Resources Ltd. (ILU) , the world’s
biggest zircon producer, fell to the lowest in more than three
months in Sydney trading after saying  China ’s demand declined.  The Perth-based company slipped 4.1 percent to A$10.03 at
12:21 p.m. local time, the lowest since July 1.  Australia ’s
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed. Zircon is used
to glaze ceramics, including tiled floor coverings favored in
China, the biggest consumer of the mineral.  Residential housing construction growth in China slowed to
the equivalent of 1.8 million apartments in August, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. About 75 percent of floor
coverings in new homes in China are tiles,  according to Iluka ,
which is opening new offices in the country to target sales in
inland provinces.  Weak demand in the quarter is “unlikely to be offset in
full by stronger sales volumes in the fourth quarter,” Iluka
said today in a statement.  Revenue from mineral sands declined 35 percent in the
quarter to A$147 million ($140 million) from A$224.5 million in
the same period a year earlier on lower prices.  Production of zircon was 98,100 metric tons in the quarter,
from 77,700 tons in the same period the previous year, Iluka
said. The median of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
was 80,000 metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
