Energy Future Holdings Corp.’s lower
earnings forecast for its regulated power-line utility reduces
the unit’s estimated value, according to debt researcher
CreditSights Inc.  Oncor Electric Delivery Co. projects earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to be $1.93
billion in 2017, according to a regulatory filing yesterday.
That figure is less than the $2.02 billion that the company
predicted in an April disclosure. Net income for 2017 is now
expected to be $465 million, compared with a previous estimate
of $524 million.  In the most recent filing, “both earnings and Ebitda
estimates are lower than previous disclosures,” CreditSights
analysts Scott Greenstein and Dot Matthews wrote in the report
yesterday. The New York-based researcher now estimates that the
80 percent of Oncor owned by Energy Future is worth $5.5 billion
to $5.9 billion.  Oncor’s $800 million of 7 percent, first-lien bonds due
September 2022 fell 1.2 cents on the dollar to 121.4 cents
yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That’s the
lowest level since May 2012.  Energy Future released financial projections for its Oncor
unit as part of a disclosure of its efforts to reach a pre-negotiated bankruptcy plan with its creditors. The proposals
sought to pare the parent company’s $43.6 billion of debt
through Chapter 11 while keeping all the subsidiaries together.
Oncor was not included in the bankruptcy plans.  Texas’ largest electricity provider has struggled to reduce
its obligations since it was taken private in a $48 billion deal
in 2007 led by KKR & Co., TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital
Partners. The biggest leveraged buyout in history left Energy
Future with more than $40 billion in debt in an unsuccessful bet
natural gas prices would rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
