Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is cutting fourth-quarter
orders for its new iPhone 5c from assemblers in  Taiwan , the Wall
Street Journal reported.  Pegatron Corp. (4938)  was told orders would be reduced by less
than 20 percent and  Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317)  Co. was informed
orders would be cut by a third, the Journal said, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter. One component
supplier was notified of a 50 percent cut in orders for parts,
the newspaper reported.  Apple, the world’s most-valuable technology company,  began
selling  the iPhone 5c last month on the same day its more
expensive iPhone 5s went on sale. The cheaper handset is a
reconfigured version of last year’s device with a plastic casing
that comes in five colors.  Kuo Mingchi, an analyst at KGI Securities Co. in Taipei, on
Oct. 11 cut his estimate for fourth-quarter shipments of the 5c
by 33 percent, citing weak orders. Chinese technology news
website  CTech  on Oct. 10 reported that production had been
halved, citing people close to the manufacturers which it didn’t
identify.  Simon Hsing, a spokesman for Hon Hai, and Charles Lin,
chief financial officer at Pegatron, both declined to comment on
customer orders. Takashi Takebayashi, a Tokyo-based spokesman
for Apple, didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment.  The iPhone 5c began U.S. sales on Sept. 20 with a suggested
price of $99 for a 16-gigabyte model with a service contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
