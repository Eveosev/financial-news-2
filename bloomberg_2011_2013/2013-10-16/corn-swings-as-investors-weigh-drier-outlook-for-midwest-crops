Soybean futures rose on speculation
the harvest will slow because of cold, wet weather in central
areas of the U.S., the world’s biggest producer. Corn and wheat
prices fell.  Southern  Nebraska  and central  Kansas  were at risk of frost
or freezing weather this morning and may get frost tomorrow,
National Weather Service data show. Western and northern areas
of the Midwest had at least an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain in
the past week. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  hasn’t issued
data on crop conditions since the partial government shutdown
began this month.  “Rains are delaying the harvest, reducing the supplies
available for crushers and exporters,” Tim Emslie, the research
manager at CHS Hedging Inc. in Inver Grove Heights,  Minnesota ,
said in a telephone interview. “Farmers should be able to get
back into fields later this week, so the rally may be limited.”  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 0.7 percent to
close at $12.765 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. The price has dropped 9.4 percent this year after South
American output climbed to a record.  Soybean-oil futures in Chicago rose to the highest this
month after U.S. inventories dropped.  Reserves at the end of September fell to 1.372 billion
pounds from 2.063 billion a year earlier and 1.669 billion at
the end of August, the National Oilseed Processors Association
said yesterday.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 0.2 percent to
$4.4275 a bushel. The price climbed 2.4 percent in the previous
two days. The grain has plunged 37 percent this year on
forecasts that U.S. production will reach a record 13.84 billion
bushels, recovering from a drought in 2012.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$6.815 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $6.7825, the lowest
for a most-active contract since Oct. 2. The grain has declined
12 percent this year.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
