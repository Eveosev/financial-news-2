Singapore’s home sales fell 52
percent in September from a year ago, signaling that the
government’s efforts to cool its  property market  are working.  Home sales fell to 1,246 units last month compared with
2,621 in September 2012, according to data from the  Urban
Redevelopment Authority  released today. From the previous month,
sales increased 65 percent from a revised 756 units sold in
August as developers marketed more projects, the data showed.  Record home prices amid low  interest rates  raised concerns
of a housing bubble and prompted the government to widen a
campaign that started in 2009 to curb speculation in Asia’s
second-most expensive housing market. Singapore unveiled new
rules in June governing how financial institutions grant
property loans to individuals, in addition to previous curbs
including new taxes and higher down-payments.  “The total debt-servicing ratio measures is really biting
into the market now,” said David Neubronner, national director
of residential project sales in Singapore at broker  Jones Lang
LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  “I expect sales to be sub-1,000 units a month over
the next three months.”  Home prices  in the island-state rose at the slowest pace in
six quarters in the three months ended Sept. 30.  The island-state’s private residential property price index
rose 0.4 percent to a  record  216.2 points in the three months
ended Sept. 30, after climbing 1 percent in the second quarter,
according to preliminary figures released by the authority on
Oct. 1. That was the smallest gain since the first quarter of
2012, when the index dropped 0.1 percent.  Among the developers that began sales of their projects was
United Venture Development (Thomson) Pte, which sold 264 units
of 320 marketed at its “Thomson Three” project last month, the
data showed. Sky Vue, offered by Allamanda Residential
Development Pte, sold 433 of 505 units offered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
