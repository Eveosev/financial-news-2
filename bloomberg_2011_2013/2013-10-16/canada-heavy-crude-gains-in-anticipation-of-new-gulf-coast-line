Canadian heavy  crude oil 
strengthened on the spot market in anticipation of the
completion of a new pipeline to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Construction of  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s 700,000-barrel-a-day
Gulf Coast pipeline to Nederland, Texas, from the U.S. storage
hub of Cushing,  Oklahoma , has accelerated and will probably be
completed by early January, according to a  report  today by
energy information company Genscape Inc., which conducted aerial
flyovers of the line on Sept. 29 and Oct. 6. TransCanada is
preparing the line for commercial service late this year, Shawn
Howard, a company spokesman based in Calgary, said in an e-mail.  Western Canadian Select heavy oil strengthened by $2.25 a
barrel to a $29.25 discount to U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate crude, erasing the prior trading day’s decline,
according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc.  The Gulf Coast line would connect WCS crude to the Gulf
Coast market, where refineries have been built to take heavy oil
imports from Mexico and Venezuela that are of similar quality
but more expensive than Canadian crudes. Maya heavy crude traded
at $93.26 a barrel as of 4:14 p.m.  New York  time, compared with
$71.69 a barrel for WCS, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Also on the Canadian  spot market , Syncrude, a light oil
processed from Canadian oil-sands bitumen, strengthened 25 cents
to a $10.50 discount, Net Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
