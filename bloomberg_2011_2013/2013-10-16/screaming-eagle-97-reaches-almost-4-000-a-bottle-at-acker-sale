A single bottle of Screaming Eagle
 Cabernet Sauvignon  from the  California  grower’s 1997 vintage,
its most expensive since 1992, sold for $3,936 at a New York
sale this month as demand for rare wines pushed prices higher.  The lot was sold through Acker Merrall & Condit on Oct. 5.
A bottle of the same vintage cost $3,690 at an Acker sale in
June, $3,485 in both April and September and $3,198 in February,
according to the auction house’s online data.  The focus of investors and collectors has switched away
from Bordeaux lately, buoying demand for older vintages and rare
wines from regions including Burgundy, the Rhone and California.
Prices of top Bordeaux wines on  London ’s Liv-ex declined during
the past seven months following a muted investor response to the
2012 vintage and reduced Chinese demand reflecting a crackdown
on spending by officials.  “Screaming Eagle has become one of the iconic wines,”
Acker Chief Executive Officer  John Kapon  said in a telephone
interview. He said auctions are reflecting an “active healthy
market with a lot of strong prices.”  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, has fallen 6 percent since mid-March after gains of 8
percent in the first 10 weeks of this year, leaving it up less
than 2 percent since the end of 2012.  Hamptons Sale  The vineyard producing Screaming Eagle is in Napa’s
Oakville district and prices reflect both high scores from
critics and small production levels, according to data on the
website of the  Antique Wine Company , a London-based broker,
which describes it as “one of  Napa Valley ’s most famous ‘cult
wines.’”  The estate’s first vintage dates back to 1992, and its
wines are sold by mailing list only, limited to three bottles
per client, and to selected restaurants, according to Antique
Wine Company. There is a waiting list to join the allocation
pool for the wines, according to Screaming Eagle’s  website .  The lots of Screaming Eagle 1997 sold through Acker in
recent months included three bottles which sold for $11,070 at
an auction in Bridgehampton,  New York  in June, two separate
three-bottle lots which sold in New York in April and September
for $10,455 and a single bottle which sold in New York in
February for $3,198, according to Acker’s online archives.  At the  Acker  auction in New York earlier this month an
eight-bottle collection of Screaming Eagle spanning the years
1996, 1998 and every vintage between 2001 and 2006 sold for
$14,145 while three bottles of the 2007 wine sold for $7,995,
according to Acker data.  The 1997 Screaming Eagle is the estate’s most expensive
wine after the inaugural 1992 vintage, while the 2007 is the
highest priced of the past 10 years, according to merchant data
tracked by the London-based Liv-ex market.  U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker  assigned a perfect 100-point
score to Screaming Eagle wines from both the 1997 and 2007
vintages, according to data on the eRobertParker.com website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
