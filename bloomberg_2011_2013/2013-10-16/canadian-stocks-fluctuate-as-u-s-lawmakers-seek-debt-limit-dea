can postpone it and talk about it some more three months down
the road, you’re going to take the deal,” said Michael O’Brien,
 fund manager  with TD Asset Management Inc. in Toronto. He helps
manage C$216 billion ($208 billion). “For now, a lot of people
are sitting on their hands. At least in the short term, once we
do get a deal we will see a lift in the markets. At this point,
any deal is a good deal and a sigh of relief.”  The bipartisan leaders of the Senate reached an agreement
to end the fiscal impasse and to increase U.S. borrowing
authority, and the Senate and House could vote on it as soon as
today. The White House press secretary said President  Barack
Obama  supports the deal.  Senate Deal  The agreement also would end the 16-day-old government
