Gafisa SA (GFSA3) , the Brazilian homebuilder
whose sales missed estimates in the past two quarters, fell as
new projects trailed the company’s projections, fueling concern
that revenue will decline.  Shares dropped 1.7 percent to 3.47 reais at 2:08 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, the second-worst performance on the  Ibovespa (IBOV) , which
added 2.3 percent. The stock earlier fell as much as 3.7 percent
to the lowest intraday level since Sept. 17.  Gafisa started 1.3 billion reais ($603 million) of new
projects in the first nine months of 2013, compared with the
company’s projection for the year of 2.7 billion reais to 3.3
billion reais, according to a regulatory filing yesterday after
the market closed. The homebuilder reported 7,779 units turned
over to buyers, or 50 percent of annual projections.  “The low levels of starts of new projects and deliveries
will lead to a cut in estimates for the company’s cash flow,”
Eduardo Silveira, an analyst at BES Securities in  Sao Paulo ,
said in a phone interview.  The Sao Paulo-based company is scheduled to release full
third-quarter results on Nov. 13. The average  estimate  among six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for annual sales of 3.4
billion reais this year, a decline of 16 percent from 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
