Dairy Farmers of America, the
largest U.S. dairy marketing cooperative, agreed to merge with
Dairylea Cooperative Inc. to boost its access to customers in
the northeast of the country.  The deal requires the approval of Dairylea shareholders at
a special meeting to be held in February, the companies said
today in a joint e-mailed statement. The financial details of
the transaction aren’t being disclosed, Kristi Dale, a DFA
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Dairylea, the biggest raw-milk marketer in the northeast,
currently markets 6.5 billion pounds of the commodity each year
from 2,000 farms in the region and has annual sales of more than
$1.7 billion. The merger would also give Dairylea members access
to other parts of the U.S. and growing international markets as
well as a share of DFA’s profits, both cooperatives said.  “Today’s dairy industry is undergoing unprecedented
change,” Dairylea Chief Executive Officer Greg Wickham said in
the statement. “From consolidation in the marketplace and
changing farm demographics to a movement toward a global dairy
industry, this change presents both challenges and
opportunities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
