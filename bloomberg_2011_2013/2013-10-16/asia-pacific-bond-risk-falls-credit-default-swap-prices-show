The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  retreated 1 basis point to 136 basis
points as of 8:42 a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The gauge is on track for a 20.4 basis-point drop
this month, which would be the most since June 2012, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 1 basis point to 110
as of 11:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia Bank
Ltd. prices. The measure is headed for its fifth consecutive
decline, on track to match the longest streak since Sept. 11,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1.5 basis point to 88
basis points as of 9:14 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The gauge is set for a 9.3 basis-point drop from
the start of the month and matches the lowest level since Sept.
19, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
