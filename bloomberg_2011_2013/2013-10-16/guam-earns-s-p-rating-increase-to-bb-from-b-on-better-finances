Guam, the U.S. territory 4,000 miles
(6,400 kilometers) west of Hawaii, had its rating raised to BB-from B+, still three steps below investment grade, by  Standard &
Poor’s  on signs of a strengthening financial position.  “The rating action reflects our view of the government’s
improved financial management practices, including improved
transparency, stricter fiscal discipline and enhanced cash flow
monitoring procedures and capabilities,” Paul Dyson, a San
Francisco-based analyst, said today in a report.  While the BB- rating remains junk, the increase is the
opposite of the New York-based company’s latest action on  Puerto
Rico , another U.S. territory. S&P in March lowered the
commonwealth to BBB-, one step above junk, citing a budget
shortfall.  The outlook on Guam’s general-obligation debt is stable,
based on a view that “tourism and the economy are likely to
improve during the next two years, benefiting Guam and providing
it with opportunities to improve its financial position,” Dyson
said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
