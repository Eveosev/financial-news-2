Vanguard Group Inc., the largest
U.S. mutual-fund firm, is merging a number of funds with similar
objectives and reducing the number of share classes it offers to
simplify its lineup.  Vanguard, in a statement today, said it’s combining the
$16.3 billion Vanguard Developed Markets Index Fund with the
$18.4 billion Vanguard Tax-Managed International Fund; the $3
billion Vanguard Tax-Managed Growth and Income Fund with the
$143 billion  Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX) ; the $738 million Vanguard
Growth Equity Fund and the $4.4 billion Vanguard U.S. Growth
Fund; and three portfolios of the Vanguard Managed Payout Fund
series.  The firm, based in Valley Forge,  Pennsylvania , will phase
out its Signal shares and make the Admiral share class available
to more clients, it said in a separate statement.  “Over the past five years we have moved to simplify our
funds and our overall fund lineup,” said William McNabb III,
Vanguard’s chief executive officer.  Vanguard manages $2.3 trillion in U.S. mutual fund assets,
including more than $300 billion in exchange-traded funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
