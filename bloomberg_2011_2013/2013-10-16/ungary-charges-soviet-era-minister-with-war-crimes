Hungarian prosecutors charged Bela
Biszku, a former minister of the Communist regime, with  war
crimes  committed in the aftermath of the 1956 revolution against
Soviet-backed rule.  Biszku, once a member of the Hungarian Communist Party’s
executive committee, played a part in the killing of 49 people
and the torture of others in the aftermath of the uprising, the
Budapest Metropolitan Chief Prosecutor’s Office said in an e-mailed statement today. Biszku, 92, faces a maximum sentence of
life in prison, according to the statement.  Hungarians revolted against Communist rule in 1956 in an
uprising crushed by the Soviet army. Repression and show trials
followed as Hungarian Communists restored their power, which
they didn’t relinquish until 1990.  Biszku said on public television Duna TV in August 2010
that he didn’t regret any of the events that occurred following
the quashing of the 1956 revolution. Biszku served as interior
minister from 1957 to 1961. He retired from national politics in
1989.  To contact the reporter on this story:
