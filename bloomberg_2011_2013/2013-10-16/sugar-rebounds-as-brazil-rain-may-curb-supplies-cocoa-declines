Sugar rebounded in New York on
speculation rains will curb output in  Brazil  while  India  boosts
exports. Cocoa fell.  India may have sold 100,000 metric tons of sugar, Newedge
Group said in a report yesterday. Rain in Brazil means the crop
is humid, reducing production of higher-quality sugar,
University of Sao Paulo research group Cepea said this week.
Prices dropped 1.8 percent yesterday after rallying 5 percent
this month. Brazil and India are the largest sugar producers.  “Apparently, the strength in the market has brought in
producer selling from Brazil, India, Mexico,”  Thomas Kujawa ,
co-head of the softs department at Sucden Financial Ltd. in
London, said in a report today. “The funds are probably not
about to hit the exit button until a break below 18/17.7
cents.”  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.4 percent to 18.77
cents a pound at 8:10 a.m. in New York on ICE Futures U.S.
Trading was 58 percent below the average for the past 100 days
at this time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. White, or
refined, sugar gained 0.2 percent in London.  Arabica coffee was little changed at $1.165 a pound in New
York and robusta fell 0.2 percent to $1,676 a ton. Cocoa dropped
0.7 percent to $2,742 a ton in New York and declined 0.9 percent
in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
