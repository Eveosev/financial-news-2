Hong Kong   stocks  swung between gains
and losses as lawmakers resumed talks to avoid a U.S. default
after scrapping a deal ahead of the deadline tomorrow
to raise the debt ceiling.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.2 percent to 23,276.90 as of
9:34 a.m. in Hong Kong after rising as much as 0.1 percent. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known as the H-share
index, lost 0.2 percent to 10,642.57.  Futures on the U.S. equity gauge gained 0.5 percent as
Senate leaders restarted negotiations aimed at avoiding a
default and ending a government shutdown after the House delayed
voting on a plan stripped of Republican conditions. The U.S.
equity gauge slipped 0.7 percent yesterday after Senate Majority
Leader  Harry Reid  rejected a House proposal to end the impasse
over the $16.7 trillion debt limit.  With U.S. borrowing authority set to lapse tomorrow and the
absence of a deal spurring a surge in Treasuries, Fitch Ratings
put the world’s biggest economy on watch for a possible credit
downgrade, citing lawmakers’ inability to forge an agreement.  The  Hang Seng Index  climbed 18 percent from this year’s low
in June through yesterday as economic data showed China’s growth
is stabilizing. Hong Kong’s equity benchmark traded at 11.1
times estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 15.3 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  China releases gross domestic product data Oct. 18, with
economists predicting 7.8 percent expansion in the three months
to Sept. 30 from 7.5 percent in the previous period. Data on
industrial production and retail sales are also expected to be
released that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
