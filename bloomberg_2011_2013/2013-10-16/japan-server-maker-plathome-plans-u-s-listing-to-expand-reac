Plathome Co. (6836) , an unprofitable
Japanese maker of network servers, plans to raise about 10
billion yen ($102 million) by selling shares in the U.S. to
finance product development.  The Tokyo-based company intends to sell  American Depositary
Receipts  on the Nasdaq Stock Market or the  New York  Stock
Exchange in the next two years, President Tomoyasu Suzuki said
in an interview. Plathome shares jumped 18 percent today in
Tokyo trading.  Plathome joins Japanese technology companies including  Ubic
Inc. (2158)  and Opt Creation Inc. in pursuing a U.S. listing as they
seek to expand the market for their products. The company, whose
customers include  Softbank Corp. (9984) , needs money to develop a new
version of servers that can power cloud-computing networks,
Suzuki said this week.  “A presence in the U.S. is vital for this business to grow
globally,” Suzuki said. “Several billions of yen is needed to
develop cutting-edge technology in the area of computer hardware
development.”  Suzuki added that Plathome hasn’t finalized any plans for a
U.S. share sale.  Founded in 1993 and listed on the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange’s
Mothers Market for smaller companies in July 2000, Plathome
hasn’t posted an  annual profit  since 2001, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s loss shrank to 290 million
yen in the 12 months through March 31 from 444 million yen the
previous year.  Plathome rose by the daily limit of 100 yen in Tokyo to 648
yen, giving it a market value of 881 million yen. That’s still
down from a peak of 32,500 yen on Nov. 30, 2000.  The company has spent about 85 percent of the 8 billion yen
it raised in its Tokyo initial public offering, Suzuki said. It
had 1.43 billion yen of cash and near-cash items as of June 30,
down from 2.07 billion yen two years earlier.  Suzuki said he’s considering opening offices in the U.S.,
 Israel  and the U.K. to bolster his company’s access to global
customers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
