Cattle futures rose, extending a
rally that began in May, on mounting speculation that improved
demand for U.S. beef is tightening animal supplies. Hog prices
also gained.  At a cattle auction yesterday in El Campo,  Texas , steers
weighing 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 600 pounds fetched $1.55
a pound on average from beef processors, up 1.9 percent from a
week earlier, data from El Campo Livestock Co. show. Beef prices
also are up, according to  Urner Barry , a Bayville, New-Jersey-based provider of agriculture data and livestock news. U.S.
Department of Agriculture price and slaughter data have been
halted by the government shutdown since Oct. 1.  “Strong demand is pushing all protein up,”  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar Commodity Investments Co.
in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for December delivery increased 0.3 percent
to $1.332 a pound at 12:08 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are up 13 percent since touching this year’s
low of $1.17825 on May 20 and yesterday reached $1.33225, the
highest for a most-active contract since Jan. 31.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement rose 0.3
percent to $1.67975 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for December settlement increased 1.2 percent
to 88.825 cents a pound in Chicago, after gaining 1.7 percent
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
