The rand gained for the first time
in three days after U.S. lawmakers resumed talks to avoid a debt
default and reopen the government, fueling demand for riskier
assets including South African bonds.  Senate leaders are rushing to lock down an agreement to end
the fiscal impasse, stepping in after House Republicans’ last-minute plan to avert a government default collapsed. Fitch
Ratings Ltd. put the  U.S. economy  on watch for a possible credit
downgrade, citing lawmakers’ inability to forge a deal. South
African retail sales expanded at the slowest pace in 3 1/2 years
in August, a report today may show.  “Sentiment in global markets has swung from yesterday’s
hope that a U.S. political deal will be reached, to despair
overnight, and back to hope this morning,”  John Cairns , a
currency strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said
in e-mailed comments. “One still has to assume that a last-minute deal will be struck; the alternative is too daunting to
contemplate.”  The rand appreciated 0.2 percent to 9.9633 per dollar as of
10:23 a.m. in Johannesburg. Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent
bonds due December 2026 were little changed at 7.93 percent.  Foreign investors  bought  a net 1.03 billion rand ($103
million) of South African bonds yesterday, the most in a day
since Sept. 27, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Retail sales in  Africa ’s biggest economy rose 1.1 percent
in August from 2.8 percent the previous month, a report may show
at 1 p.m. in  Pretoria , according to the median estimate of 12
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Growth at that rate would be
the slowest since February 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
