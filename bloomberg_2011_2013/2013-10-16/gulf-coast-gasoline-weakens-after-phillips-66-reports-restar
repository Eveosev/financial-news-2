Spot gasoline discounts on the U.S.
 Gulf Coast  widened against futures for the second straight day
after  Phillips 66 (PSX)  reported a unit startup at the Borger refinery
in  Texas .  The 146,000-barrel-a-day plant was preparing to begin
starting the Unit 40 fluid catalytic cracker, the company said
in a  notice  to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
yesterday. Fluid Catalytic crackers process vacuum gasoil into
gasoline and other lighter products.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  dropped 1 cent against
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange to a discount of
10.25 cents a gallon at 4:05 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Conventional  CBOB gasoline  weakened 1.75 cents to
11.25 cents a gallon below futures.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) â€™s 451,000-barrel-a-day Galveston
Bay refinery reported an Oct. 14 valve leak associated with the
No. 3 ultraformer, a  notice  to state regulators shows. Jamal Kheiry, a spokesman for Marathon in Findlay,  Ohio , declined by
e-mail yesterday to comment on the upset.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , narrowed 7 cents to
$11.93 a barrel. Cracks based on  Light Louisiana Sweet oil , the
Gulf Coast benchmark, widened 53 cents to $10.78 a barrel.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf Coast spot market was
unchanged against ULSD futures on the Nymex at a discount of 6
cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
