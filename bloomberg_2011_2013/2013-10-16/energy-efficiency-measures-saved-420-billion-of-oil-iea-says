Energy efficiency measures saved the
equivalent of 570 million metric tons of oil equivalent, worth
$420 billion, in 11 nations from 2005 though 2010, according to
the  International Energy Agency .  Without efficiency measures, consumers in the IEA member
countries would now be consuming about two-thirds more energy
than currently, the Paris-based group said today in a  report .  Energy efficiency around the world drew investment of as
much as $300 billion in 2011, a level on par with global
investments in renewable energy or fossil-fuel power generation,
the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
