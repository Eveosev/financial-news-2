  BC Partners  Ltd., Lion Capital LLP
and Bain Capital Partners LLC are among private-equity firms
considering bids for Stokke AS, a Norwegian maker of children’s
furniture, five people with knowledge of the situation said.  Advent International Corp. and Stockholm-based Nordic
Capital, may also make offers for Alesund, Norway-based Stokke
before an Oct. 21 deadline, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the talks are private.  Stokke, whose products include the “Tripp Trapp”
highchair, may favor a private-equity firm with experience of
growing businesses internationally, said one of the people.  The company, owned by the family of the same name since it
was started in 1932, appointed  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to
examine strategic options in May and is expected to fetch about
400 million euros ($540 million), the people said.  Spokeswomen for Advent International,  Bain Capital , Lion
Capital and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Spokesmen for BC
Partners and Stokke didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed
requests seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
