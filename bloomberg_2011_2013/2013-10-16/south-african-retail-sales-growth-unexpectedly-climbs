South African  retail  sales growth
unexpectedly quickened for a second month to 3 percent in
August.  Sales growth accelerated after expanding a revised 2.9
percent in July, Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa  said on
its website today. The  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of
12 economists was for growth of 1.1 percent. Sales grew 1.1
percent in the month.  The Reserve Bank cut its economic growth forecast for this
year to 2 percent as  inflation (SACPIYOY)  pressures curb  consumer spending 
and demand for credit. Inflation exceeded the central bank’s 3
percent to 6 percent target range for a second consecutive month
in August.  Consumer confidence  in Africa’s largest economy fell to a
10-year low in the third quarter as strikes hit the
manufacturing and mining industries and gasoline costs soared to
a record. Policy makers have kept the benchmark lending rate at
5 percent, the lowest level in more than 30 years, since July
2012.  The outlook for household consumption expenditure remains
uncertain as high wage settlements are counterbalanced by low
employment, high debt levels and rising prices,  Reserve Bank 
Deputy Governor Francois Groepe said on Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
