The rupiah touched a three-week high
and government bonds advanced on speculation a continuing U.S.
budget impasse increases the chance the  Federal Reserve  will
delay tapering stimulus that has buoyed  emerging markets .  The Indonesian currency gained last week by the most since
January 2012 as global funds added 2.61 trillion rupiah ($234
million) to rupiah  sovereign debt holdings  in the first four
days of the week, finance ministry data show. U.S. Senate
leaders are resuming talks before the nation’s borrowing
authority lapses tomorrow. The Fed unexpectedly refrained from
reducing its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases in September.  The Indonesian currency rose 0.3 percent from Oct. 11 to
11,333 per dollar as of 9:29 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local
banks show. It touched 11,301 earlier, the strongest level since
Sept. 20, after climbing 1.4 percent last week. Local financial
markets were closed on Oct. 14 and Oct. 15 for public holidays.  “The rupiah is extending its rally on optimism the Fed
will further delay its tapering plans due to the continuing debt
ceiling debate,” said Rully Nova, a currency analyst at PT Bank
Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta. “The market isn’t concerned
about a U.S. default as they will probably push back the debt
talks while still meeting payments.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.2 percent to
11,035 per dollar, 2.7 percent stronger than the spot rate, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. A fixing used to settle the offshore
forwards was set at 11,068 per dollar on Oct. 11, according to
the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  Current Account  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 14.99 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Indonesia ’s current-account deficit may be 2.5 percent of
gross domestic product next year,  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at
DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, wrote in an Oct. 11
research note. That compares with the central bank’s estimate of
3.4 percent for this year and the record 4.4 percent shortfall
in the second quarter.  “With the external balance picture improving and prompting
yield-seeking inflows, there is room for the rupiah to
strengthen to 10,000 by the end of the year,” Bank Himpunan
Saudara’s Nova said.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 dropped five basis points to 7.92 percent, the lowest level
since Sept. 20, prices according to prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
