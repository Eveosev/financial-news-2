Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  is getting  General Electric Co. (GE)  stock worth $260.7 million
after exercising warrants it received as part of an investment
during the 2008 financial crisis.  Berkshire will get 10.7 million shares of the world’s
largest maker of jet engines, medical scanners and diesel
locomotives, according to a regulatory filing today from
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE.  The transaction marks a milestone in Chief Executive
Officer Jeffrey Immelt’s recovery from damage suffered in the
aftermath of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse, including
the loss of GE’s AAA credit rating and the first reduction of
its dividend since 1938. The company in 2011 redeemed $3 billion
in preferred stock it issued to Berkshire as part of the capital
injection.  The billionaire and GE amended the agreement governing the
warrants in January to allow a cashless transaction using the
average closing price during a period of 20 trading days
preceding the exchange to compute the payout. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire passed on a chance to lay out $3 billion for
shares at $22.25, while GE reduced the dilution for its
shareholders.  GE  climbed  0.7 percent to $24.36 today. The shares have
declined 4.5 percent since Sept. 30, 2008, the day before
Buffett’s investment was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
