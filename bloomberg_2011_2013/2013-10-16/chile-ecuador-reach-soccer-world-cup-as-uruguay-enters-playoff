Chile  and Ecuador secured South
America’s final two direct berths at next year’s soccer World
Cup, consigning 2010 semifinalist Uruguay to a playoff.  Chile beat Ecuador 2-1 in Santiago, a result that sends
both teams to the 32-nation tournament in Brazil. Argentina and
Colombia were already assured of two of the nine-team
continental group’s four berths.  Uruguay’s 3-2 home victory against group winner Argentina
in Montevideo wasn’t enough to overhaul Ecuador, which took
 fourth place  because of a superior goal difference.  The Uruguayans finished fifth and will enter their fourth
straight World Cup playoff, where they’ll face Jordan over two
matches next month to decide another spot at the 2014
tournament.  Brazil  automatically qualified as host.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
