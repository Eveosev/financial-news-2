Russian stocks rose after a court
suspended opposition leader Alexey Navalny’s five-year prison
sentence, boosting appetite for the nation’s equities.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  jumped as much as 0.3 percent after the
decision, erasing a 0.6 percent decline, and traded up 0.1
percent at 1,532.54 as of 1:08 p.m. in Moscow. Power
transmission company Federal Grid Co. rallied 3 percent, while
OAO Rostelecom, the state-run telecommunications operator,
increased 2.5 percent to 109.15 rubles.  Navalny, 37, who in the past two years helped organize the
biggest demonstrations against Putin’s 13-year rule, won’t serve
the prison term though the appeal judge in the city of Kirov
upheld his conviction for embezzlement at a hearing today. The
Micex has risen 1.3 percent this week.  “Improving sentiment will be bolstered further by the
decision not to imprison Navalny on what was clearly a bogus and
even comical conviction,” Julian Rimmer, a trader with CF
Global Trading UK Ltd. in  London , said by e-mail. The court
decision is a “fillip for the risk-on investment mindset,” he
said.  Crude oil,  Russia ’s main export earner, added 0.2 percent
to $101.39 per barrel in  New York . U.S. leaders in the Senate
are rushing to lock down an agreement to end the nation’s fiscal
impasse, stepping in after House Republicans’ last-minute plan
to avert a U.S. government default collapsed.  Russian equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21
emerging economies monitored by Bloomberg, with shares on the
index trading at 4.5 times projected 12-month earnings, compared
with a multiple of 10.7 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.
Ten-day  price swings  on the Micex rose to 12.459 from 14.364
yesterday.  Navalny, who was a runner-up in last month’s elections for
Moscow mayor, was found guilty in July of defrauding a state
timber company in Kirov, 900 kilometers (560 miles) northeast of
Moscow. His conviction, which can still be appealed in a higher
court, would exclude him from ever holding public office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
