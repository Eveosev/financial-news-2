Canola futures rose to the highest
in almost four weeks on signs that demand from overseas buyers
is increasing for crops from  Canada , the world’s top grower.  Exports  will probably rise 7.4 percent this season from a
year earlier, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has forecast.
Canola processing gained 3.3 percent to 151,795 metric tons in
the week that ended Oct. 9 from a week earlier, according to the
Canadian Oilseed Processors Association.  “Offshore demand is pretty good,” Lorne Boundy, a trader
with Paterson Grain, said in a telephone interview from
Winnipeg. “They’re looking at the seed in general for crush,
for oil.”  Canola futures for November settlement rose 1.4 percent to
C$493.90 ($477.08) a ton at 12:42 p.m. on ICE Futures Exchange
in Winnipeg, after touching $494.50, the highest for a most-active contract since Sept. 19. The oilseed declined 17 percent
this year through yesterday on signs of increasing production.  Output this season may climb to a record 16 million metric
tons, exceeding the record of 14.6 million tons in 2011,
 Statistics Canada  said Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
