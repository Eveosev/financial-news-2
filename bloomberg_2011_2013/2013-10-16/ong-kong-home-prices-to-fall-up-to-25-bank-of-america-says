Hong Kong   home prices  will fall as
much as 25 percent from their peak as housing supply increases
and the possibility of rising interest rates grows, according to
Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit.  Prices will drop 5 percent this year and another 15 percent
in 2014, Raymond Ngai, a property analyst, told reporters at a
briefing in the city today. He declined to give forecasts beyond
2014. UBS AG said yesterday that it expects prices to decline 5
percent in 2013 before dropping 15 percent to 20 percent next
year.  Hong Kong  home prices  have fallen about 3 percent since
March and transactions are at the lowest in almost two decades,
after the government in February imposed its toughest yet
measures to curb concerns of a real estate bubble. Prices have
more than doubled since early 2009 on record-low  mortgage rates ,
a shortage of new housing supply and an influx of mainland
Chinese buyers.  “The housing market has peaked,” Ngai said. “The 20 to
25 percent drop will probably bring prices back to the level
around 2011, but even at that, many people would still find it
difficult to buy properties.”  Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who has pledged to
increase land supply since coming to office last July, said in
January the private sector may sell 67,000 homes in the next
three to four years. Hong Kong developers  completed  48,936 homes
from 2008 to 2013, the lowest in any five-year period since data
became available in 1985.  Price War  Home transactions in the third quarter have fallen to the
lowest since the government began making the data available in
1996. Leung doubled the stamp duty on all property transactions
above HK$2 million ($257,914) in February. He also has imposed a
15 percent extra tax on non-resident buyers and raised minimum
down-payment requirements for some mortgages.  Hong Kong property prices may rebound to levels before the
curbs were introduced if the restrictions are removed or
partially eased, Leung said yesterday.  As transactions slow, a price war between developers will
intensify, said Ngai.  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1) , the city’s
biggest builder by market value, earlier this year cut prices at
a new project in the city to boost sale.  Ngai said he’s still “positive” about Hong Kong
developers because of their “attractive valuation.” They are
also less dependent on the performance of the home market
because of the portfolio of investment properties they have
accumulated over the years, he said.  The Hang Seng Property Index, which tracks nine of the
biggest Hong Kong-listed developers, has gained 80 percent since
the beginning of 2009, while an index compiled by realtor
Centaline Property Agency Ltd. shows home prices have jumped 108
percent in the period.  The Hang Seng Property Index is down 3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
