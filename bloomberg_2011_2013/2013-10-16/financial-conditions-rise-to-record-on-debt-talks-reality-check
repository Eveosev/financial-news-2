U.S. financial conditions climbed to
the highest level on record as the Senate crafted a deal to
raise the debt ceiling and avert a default.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS)  increased
0.10 to 1.51, the highest in records dating back to January
1994. The gauge measures stress in the markets by combining
everything from money-market rates to yields on government and
corporate bonds to volatility in equities. During the debt-ceiling debate of August 2011, the index fell as low as negative
1.631.  The measure rose from last week’s one-month low of 1.16 as
the Senate and House plan to vote as soon as today on the
agreement that would end the 16-day-old government shutdown and
allow the U.S. to continue borrowing, a day before its authority
lapses.  House Republicans  today signaled that they will let the
accord pass largely with Democratic votes.  “Everyone is basically assuming we’re going to get a vote
on a deal sometime today, if not in the next few hours,”  Mark McDonnell , a senior  money manager  at Hillswick Asset Management
LLC in Stamford,  Connecticut , which manages $1.3 billion, said
in a telephone interview.  The Senate compromise would fund the government through
Jan. 15, 2014, and suspend the debt limit until Feb. 7.  Treasuries  One-month Treasury rates fell 20.8 basis points to 0.14
percent at 4:12 p.m. in New York after touching 0.45 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark  10-year
yield (USGG10YR)  fell 6 basis points to 2.66 percent, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader data.  Stocks  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  rose 1.38 percent to close at
1,721.54, almost climbing to its all-time high of 1,725.52
reached on Sept. 18. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained
205.8 points, or 1.4 percent, to 15,373.83.  Rate Swaps  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt-market stress, rose 1.13 basis points to 13.38 basis
points. The gauge typically narrows when investors favor assets
such as corporate bonds and widens when they seek the perceived
safety of  government securities . The measure has dropped from
this year’s high of 19.55 on June 21.  Default Swaps  A gauge of U.S. company credit risk fell. The Markit CDX
North American Investment Grade Index, a credit-default swaps
benchmark that investors use to hedge against losses or to
speculate on creditworthiness, declined 3.4 basis points to a
mid-price of 73.7 basis points, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has averaged
81.7 this year.  Currencies  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, fell 0.07 percent to 1,011.89. The
index has traded in a range of 1,007.9 and 1,038.63 in the past
three months.  Volatility  The  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , or VIX, plummeted 21.17 percent
to 14.71, the lowest level since Sept. 26. Volatility in
Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE
index fell to 73.17, compared with the average this year of
72.48. Currency swings as measured by the JPMorgan Global
Volatility Index were unchanged at 8.34.  Energy, Commodities  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery
rose $1.00, or 0.99 percent, to $102.21 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.66 percent to
$1,281.6 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  Copper futures for delivery in December rose 0.1 percent to
$3.311 a pound on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
