Vivendi SA (VIV) , the French conglomerate
selling assets to cut debt and refocus on media businesses, will
reimburse as much as $2.7 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated
debt using part of the proceeds from its sale of  Activision
Blizzard Inc. (ATVI)   Vivendi said it started an offer today to purchase any and
all of its outstanding $650 million of 3.450 percent notes due
2018, $700 million of 6.625 percent notes due 2018 and $800
million 4.750 percent notes due 2022. The Paris-based company
will also redeem all of its $550 million 2.40 percent notes due
2015.  Activision, a video game publisher based in  Santa Monica ,
California, gained its independence in a $8.2 billion buyout
last week after five years as a unit of Vivendi. Activision
bought back $5.83 billion of stock from Vivendi, while a group
led by the unit’s Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick paid
$2.34 billion in the transaction.  Divesting Activision is part of Vivendi’s plans to overhaul
its structure to boost its market valuation. The company, whose
biggest shareholder is French billionaire  Vincent Bollore , is
also in exclusive talks to sell its stake in Maroc Telecom SA to
 Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT)  The company is also studying
how Vivendi’s remaining assets -- record label Universal Music
Group Inc., pay-TV company Canal Plus and Brazilian Internet
unit GVT -- will be structured as two separate entities.  Shares of Vivendi gained 3.5 percent to 18.95 euros at 5:00
p.m. in Paris. The stock has jumped 18 percent in the past 12
months, bringing the company’s market value to 25.4 billion
euros ($34 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
