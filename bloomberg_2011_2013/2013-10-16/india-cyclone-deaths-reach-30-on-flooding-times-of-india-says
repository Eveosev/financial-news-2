The most powerful cyclone to hit
 India  in 14 years has killed at least 30 people after the heavy
rains triggered flooding.  Helicopters are dropping supplies to the stranded and the
army is carrying out relief operations in  Odisha  state,
according to a statement from the Defense Ministry late
yesterday. The death toll from the storm has climbed to 30, the
Times of India newspaper reported, without saying where it got
the information.  “The loss of life has been contained to a very large
extent because of the preventive measures taken in advance,”
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a statement yesterday. He
said there has been extensive damage to property, crops and
livestock as he expressed sympathies for those affected.  India carried out the largest evacuation in the nation’s
history, shifting 1 million people from the path of a cyclone
that hit the nation’s eastern coast on Oct. 12. Heavy rains and
winds as high as 210 kilometers (130 miles) an hour lashed the
region, flooding roads and uprooting trees. Cyclone Phailin is
the strongest to hit Odisha since 1999, when a tropical storm
with wind speeds of 260 kilometers per hour killed 9,000 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
