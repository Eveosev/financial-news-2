Just Retirement Holdings Ltd., the
U.K. insurer owned by Permira Advisers LLP, plans to start the
process for an initial public offering in  London  as early as
tomorrow, said two people with knowledge of the sale.  The company will issue shares to raise about 300 million
pounds ($478 million) and the European buyout firm Permira plans
to sell some of its stake, said the people, who asked not
to be named as the details aren’t public.  The insurer would join companies such as central European
distiller  Stock Spirits Group Ltd. (0224594D)  in beginning the IPO process
in London this year. Deutsche Bank AG and Nomura Holdings Inc.
are leading a group of banks managing the sale, the people said.
IPOs on European exchanges have raised almost $15 billion this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, more than twice
the amount in the same period a year earlier.  Representatives at Permira and Just Retirement declined to
comment, as did officials at Deutsche Bank and Nomura.  To contact the reporters on this story:
