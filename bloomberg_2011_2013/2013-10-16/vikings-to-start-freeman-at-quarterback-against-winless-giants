Josh Freeman will be the  Minnesota 
Vikings’ starting quarterback during this week’s “Monday Night
Football” game against the New York Giants, less than two weeks
after being cut by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  The Vikings signed Freeman to a one-year, $3 million
contract on Oct. 7, four days after he was released by the
Buccaneers. He’ll be the third starting quarterback of the
National Football League season for the Vikings, who are 1-4.  Christian Ponder started the first three games in
Minnesota’s 0-3 start, while Matt Cassel started the past two 
games -- going 1-1 -- after Ponder broke a rib. Vikings coach 
Leslie Frazier said Freeman, a former first-round draft pick, 
has adapted well to the team’s offensive system.  “I like his work ethic,” Frazier told reporters. “He has
done enough for us to say that he is ready.”  Freeman, 25, had been the Buccaneers’ starter since his
rookie season in 2009 before being replaced by Mike Glennon, a
third-round pick in this year’s NFL draft. Freeman had completed
an NFL-low 45.7 percent of his passes during Tampa Bay’s 0-3
start before being cut.  The Vikings are listed by oddsmakers as 3 1/2-point
underdogs for their Oct. 21 game against the 0-6 Giants at
MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
