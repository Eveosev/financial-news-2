Crude oil options volatility fell as
futures gained amid optimism Congress will end the 16-day
government shutdown and raise debt ceiling, averting default.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value,
slipped to 20.44 percent at 4:04 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  from 21.57 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose
$1.08, or 1.1 percent, to $102.49 a barrel on the Nymex.  Futures rose as the Senate and the House plan to vote on a
deal crafted by Senate leaders and supported by President  Barack
Obama . House Speaker  John Boehner  said Republicans wonâ€™t prevent
a vote on the Senate compromise.  Puts accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading volume
today.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
