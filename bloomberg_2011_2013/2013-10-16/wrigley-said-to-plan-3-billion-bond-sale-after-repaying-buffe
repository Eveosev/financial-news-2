Mars Inc.’s Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. unit
raised $3 billion with a five-part bond offering after redeeming
debt held by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   The maker of Juicy Fruit and Altoids  sold  $400 million each
of 1.4 percent, three-year securities to yield 80 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries and 2 percent, four-year
debt at a relative yield of 65 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  It also issued $550 million of 2.4 percent, five-year notes
at a 105 basis-point spread, $750 million of 2.9 percent, six-year debentures at 155 basis points and $900 million of 3.375
percent, seven-year bonds at 135.  Moody’s Investors Service last week raised the borrower’s
credit rating to Baa2 from Ba1, citing in an Oct. 7 report the
early redemption of $4.4 billion of 11.45 percent subordinated
debt held by Berkshire.  The company is also seeking $2.65 billion of loans to
refinance debt, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction, who asked not to be identified because the terms
weren’t set. A $2.15 billion, five-year term loan is being
offered at 1.25 percentage points more than the London interbank
offered rate. The credit facility includes a $500 million
unsecured revolving line of credit, also due in 2018.  Mars, which said earlier this month that it retired the
bonds on Oct. 1, had turned to Buffett for help financing its
$23 billion takeover of Wrigley in October 2008. Wrigley’s $500
million of 4.65 percent unsecured notes due July 2015 traded at
105.42 cents on the dollar on Aug. 23 to yield 1.71 percent,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
