General Electric Co. (GE)  agreed to
supply eight 1.4-megawatt biogas engines as part of a project to
provide on-site renewable heat and power for the Shafdan
wastewater-treatment plant, the biggest of its type in  Israel .  The facility south of Tel Aviv treats municipal wastewater
for 2 million people in the Dan region of central Israel, GE
Power & Water said in a statement. The engines being used in the
new biogas power plant are due to be delivered to Israel in
April and installed by next October, the company said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
