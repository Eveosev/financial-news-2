Gasoline advanced amid below-average
trading volume as Senate leaders pressed toward an agreement to
end the fiscal impasse after  House Republicans  failed in their
last-minute attempt at an accord.  Futures rose on speculation that the emerging Senate deal
would be announced as early as this morning. Any bill would
still have to pass the Republican-led House. The government is
in day 16 of a partial shutdown, facing an deadline tomorrow to
raise the debt ceiling or risk default.  “This is going to be a nail-biter down to the end,” said
 Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
Chicago. “We’re going to be addicted to headlines and we’re in
a tight range. Volumes have come down. Clients I’ve talked to
are tired of this. There’s a fatigue in the market.”  Gasoline for November delivery rose 3.21 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.6919 a gallon at 9:58 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the first increase in four days. Trading
volume was 46 percent below the 100-day average.  The U.S. AAA credit grade was placed on ratings watch
negative by  Fitch Ratings , which cited the government’s
inability to raise the debt ceiling in a timely manner,
according to a statement after markets closed in New York
yesterday.  Senate Negotiations  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, and
Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican, are
working on a deal that would fund the government through Jan.
15, 2014, and suspend the debt limit until Feb. 7. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index jumped 1 percent as of 10:14 a.m. in New
York.  “There’s hope that something is in the works and the
equity market is up pretty strongly,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .
“But, really, the market just seems to be treading water.”  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 77 cents
to $11.27 a barrel. The  premium  to Brent increased 74 cents to
$2.49 a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 1 cent to $3.357 a
gallon, the largest increase since Aug. 29, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website. Prices are 41.6 cents below
a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery advanced 2.28
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.0398 a gallon on volume that was
2.3 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  versus WTI widened 38 cents to $25.88 a
barrel. The  crack spread  over Brent rose 35 cents to $17.10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
