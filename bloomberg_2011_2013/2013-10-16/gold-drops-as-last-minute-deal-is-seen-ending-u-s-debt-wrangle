Gold futures rebounded as the
dollar’s drop boosted demand for the precious metal and
commodities as alternative investments.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24  raw materials  jumped
as much 1.2 percent and the  greenback  fell as much as 0.2
percent against a basket of 10 major currencies after Senate
leaders reached an agreement that would end the fiscal impasse
and increase U.S. borrowing authority, a day before it lapses.
The Senate and House may vote on the accord as soon as today.  “The dollar’s weakness is helping gold,” Sterling Smith,
a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “Also, higher metal and energy prices are
helping.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,282.30 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price dropped as much as 0.4 percent.  This year, the metal has slumped 23 percent, heading for
the first annual decline since 2000. Some investors lost faith
in gold as a store of value after equities rallied to a record
and inflation remained muted.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 0.8 percent to
$21.365 an ounce. The metal has tumbled 29 percent this year.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery increased 1.1 percent to $1,398.20 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery climbed 1 percent to
$713.55 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
