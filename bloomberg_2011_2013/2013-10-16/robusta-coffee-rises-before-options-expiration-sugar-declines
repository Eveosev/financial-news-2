Robusta coffee gained in  London 
before options expire today. Sugar declined.  The two November options with the most open interest give
holders the right to buy robusta coffee futures at $1,950 and
$1,750 a metric ton, at least $63 more than now. That signals
investors are protecting themselves in case prices rally as
stockpiles monitored by the NYSE Liffe exchange shrink. Robusta
slumped 3.2 percent yesterday, the most since June 20.  “Robusta is rebounding today after the big drop
yesterday,” said Edward de Wismes, an agricultural futures
broker at Aurel BGC in Paris, said today. “The large open
interest in the call options is acting as a magnet as the shorts
cover their positions ahead of the expiry. Fundamentals are not
changing the market.” Shorts are bets on lower prices.  Robusta for delivery in November gained 0.5 percent to
$1,687 a ton by 11:42 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Arabica
coffee for delivery in December climbed 0.3 percent to $1.1685 a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Investors held 9,205 contracts giving the right to buy
robusta for delivery in November at $1,950 a ton and 5,634
contracts exercisable at $1,750, exchange data showed. The
options expire at 12:30 p.m. in London.  Robusta stockpiles fell 19 percent to 60,380 tons in the
two weeks to Sept. 30, NYSE Liffe data showed. That’s below the
75,000-ton limit on deliveries to a single trader. NYSE Liffe
will update the stockpiles tomorrow.  Raw sugar fell 0.1 percent to 18.68 cents a pound on ICE
and cocoa dropped 0.1 percent to $2,756 a ton. Trading in sugar
was 65 percent below the average for the past 100 days and cocoa
was 31 percent below, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In London, white, or refined, sugar dropped 0.1 percent to
$499.60 a ton and cocoa declined 0.4 percent to 1,762 pounds
($2,825) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
