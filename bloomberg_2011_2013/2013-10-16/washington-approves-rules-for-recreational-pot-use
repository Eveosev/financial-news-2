Washington state regulators approved
rules governing the growth, processing and sale of marijuana for
recreational use, setting the framework to allow pot retailers
to open shops by the middle of next year.  The three-member Liquor Control Board today voted
unanimously to approve the rules, which will limit retail stores
to 334 statewide, and require background checks on license
applicants and warning labels on packaging.  Voters approved recreational marijuana use in a referendum
last year. Colorado is the only other U.S. state that allows it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
