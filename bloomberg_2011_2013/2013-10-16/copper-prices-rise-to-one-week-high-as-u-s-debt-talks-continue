Copper rose to the highest level in
a week after U.S. lawmakers said they’d resume talks on raising
the debt limit as the deadline approaches and as stockpiles of
the metal declined.  Copper for delivery in three months climbed rose 0.6
percent to $7,280 a metric on the London Metal Exchange at 9:43
a.m. Shanghai time. That’s the highest intraday level since Oct.
8.  With the U.S.’s borrowing authority set to lapse tomorrow,
leaders in the Senate said they’d reopen negotiations aimed at
avoiding a default and ending the 15-day-old partial government
shutdown after the Republican-controlled House scrapped a vote
on its plan.  “Any type of positive development in the talks offers
support to copper prices,” said Zhou Jie, head of the trading
department with Shanghai CIFCO Futures Co.  Stockpiles tracked by the LME fell one percent yesterday to
503,425 tons, the lowest since March 7, daily exchange figures
showed.  Copper for delivery in January rose 0.1 percent to 52,220
 yuan  ($8,560) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Metal for
delivery in December fell 0.3 percent to $3.298 a pound on the
Comex in  New York .  On the LME, aluminum and tin increases, nickel and lead
were little changed, and zinc fell.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
