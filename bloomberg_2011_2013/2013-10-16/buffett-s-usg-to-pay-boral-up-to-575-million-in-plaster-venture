USG Corp. (USG) , whose largest investor is
 Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., agreed to pay  Boral
Ltd. (BLD)  as much as $575 million to create a jointly owned building
materials business spanning Asia and the Middle East.  Sydney-based Boral will inject its gypsum unit into the
venture, the companies said in a statement today. Chicago-based
USG will contribute its Asian and Middle Eastern units and
exclusive access to products such as ceilings and plasterboard.  Boral plans to use USG’s payment to cut debt after posting
the company’s first  annual loss  since 2010. The new business,
which may allow USG to cut  reliance  on North America, will have
assets valued at $1.6 billion and sell products in 12 nations
including Boral’s largest market,  Australia , the companies said.  “We have long been focused on our strategic plan to
diversify our earnings and differentiate our business through
innovation,” USG Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim
Metcalf said in the statement.  Under the terms of the agreement, USG will pay Boral $500
million in cash when the deal is completed -- scheduled for
January 2014 -- and as much as $75 million if the venture, named
USG Boral Building Products, meets certain earnings targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
