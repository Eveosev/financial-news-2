Grupo Lala SAB (LALAB) ,  Mexico ’s biggest
dairy producer, rallied in its first day of trading after
raising at least 12.2 billion pesos ($938 million) in an initial
public offering.  Lala gained 7.6 percent to 29.59 pesos in Mexico City,
compared with a 0.3 percent advance for the country’s benchmark
IPC index of 35 companies. The stock sold for 27.50 pesos
yesterday, the top of a projected price range of 23.50 pesos to
27.50 pesos. The company offered 444.4 million shares, without
considering a 15 percent overallotment option for underwriters.  The company said in an investor presentation that the IPO
would allow it to accelerate growth and it may use shares as a
form of payment in possible acquisitions. The dairy producer
employs more than 31,000 people at 17 plants and 161
distribution centers, according to the presentation, which was
posted on the stock exchange website. Lala’s sales last year
were 40.3 billion pesos.  Before Lala’s IPO, Mexican companies had raised a record
$10.7 billion through stock sales this year, 45 percent more
than the same period of 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Including the so-called greenshoe option for
underwriters, the Lala sale may climb to 14.1 billion pesos,
which would be Mexico’s biggest IPO since lender  Grupo
Financiero Santander Mexico SAB (SANMEXB) ’s record offering last year.
Lala represents Mexico’s 17th equity deal of 2013.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. led the transaction.  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  and Morgan Stanley were among the other
banks working on the IPO.  Lala, led by Chairman Eduardo Tricio Haro, started six
decades ago as a dairy farmers’ collective in northern Mexico
and now has 53 percent of formally tracked milk sales in the
country, according to the prospectus, which cites data from AC
Nielsen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
