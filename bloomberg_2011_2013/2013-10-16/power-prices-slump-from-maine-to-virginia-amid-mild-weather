Spot wholesale electricity dropped
on the grids stretching from Maine to  Virginia  and Chicago as
mild weather limited demand.  Power consumption for  New York City  and New England came in
below the grid operators’ day-ahead forecasts. PJM
Interconnection LLC increased supplies for today while demand
was up 0.3 percent at 3:30 p.m. from the same time yesterday,
according to its website.  The high temperature in Midtown Manhattan today may be 67
degrees Fahrenheit (19 Celsius), 3 above normal, and  Washington 
may be 5 higher than average at 73 degrees, AccuWeather Inc.
said on its website. Boston will be 1 above normal at 62.  Spot prices for New York City slid $12.28, or 30 percent,
to $28.76 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 3 p.m. from
the same time yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Boston  and the broader Massachusetts hub dropped $32.60, or
52 percent, to $29.81. On-peak power at Boston traded at a
premium of $5.26 to New York, little changed from yesterday’s
average of $5.34.  Electricity at PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which includes
deliveries to Washington, was down 71 cents, or 2.1 percent, at
$33.10 a megawatt-hour. The Eastern hub was little changed, down
1 cent at $33.30.  On-peak prices at the Eastern hub, including New Jersey,
 Maryland , eastern Pennsylvania and Virginia, traded at a 17-cent
premium to the western part of the grid versus a discount of 33
cents yesterday.  PJM Power  Demand on the 13-state PJM network, from the mid-Atlantic
states to the Ohio Valley, was 88,017 megawatts at 3:30 p.m.,
1.5 percent higher than the day-ahead outlook. Power consumption
was 87,768 megawatts at the same time yesterday.  The  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania-based operator increased
total scheduled electric supplies to 123,076 megawatts for today
from 122,763 megawatts yesterday, according to a daily report.  Texas power prices gained as demand matched day-ahead
forecasts after coming in below expectations in the late morning
hours, Electric Reliability Council of Texas Inc. data show.  Ercot’s North hub, serving  Dallas , rose $12.71, or 56
percent, to $35.48 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 2
