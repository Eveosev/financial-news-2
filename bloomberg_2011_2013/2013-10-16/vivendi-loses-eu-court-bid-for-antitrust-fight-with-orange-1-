Vivendi SA (VIV)  lost a European court
challenge to have an antitrust complaint against  Orange SA (ORA) 
considered by European Union regulators.  The EU General Court in Luxembourg today rejected the
appeal, deciding that the European Commission “was not bound to
pursue a detailed investigation” because the services concerned
“had only limited effects on the functioning of the retail
markets.” The decision can be appealed.  France’s telecommunications operators are fighting to keep
phone bills from slipping further amid price wars that have
intensified since  Iliad SA (ILD)  became the fourth carrier to sell
both fixed and mobile packages in January last year. As of June,
Orange, France’s former phone monopoly, had 26.7 million mobile
customers and 33.9 million fixed broadband subscribers, while
rival SFR, a Vivendi unit, had 21 million mobile and 5.2 million
fixed subscribers.  Lawyers for Paris-based Vivendi in February told the EU
court in a hearing that the commission’s  July 2010 decision 
wrongly and insufficiently assessed the complaint that  France
Telecom , now known as Orange, abused its dominant position.  Vivendi declined to comment on today’s ruling.  The case is: T-432/10, Vivendi v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
