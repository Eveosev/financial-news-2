Cameron Harrison Private Pty  and
 Perpetual Ltd. (PPT) , which managed A$26 billion ($25 billion) at the
end of last year, agreed to settle a dispute over lost clients.  Perpetual, based in Sydney, sued Cameron Harrison in April
accusing it of poaching clients after hiring away two senior
managers. The two companies reached a settlement, terms of which
are confidential, according to an Oct. 14 statement from Cameron
Harrison.  Cameron Harrison and the two former Perpetual managers
agreed to pay “an undisclosed sum of money” and also agreed to
a non-solicitation restraint for four years, Perpetual said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Federal Court Justice Kathleen Farrell dismissed the
lawsuit on Oct. 9, according to her order posted on the court’s
website.  The case is Perpetual Ltd. v Cameron Harrison Private Pty.
