South Korea ’s financial regulator
has completed an inspection of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s local
operations and is now analyzing the results.  The  Financial Supervisory Service  hasn’t decided what
actions will be taken as a result of the probe, Cho Gook Hwan,
director-general at the FSS said by phone. The Korea Economic
Daily earlier today reported the regulator plans to ask local
prosecutors to investigate the U.S. firm’s Hong Kong unit,
alleging the company offered investments to Korean clients
without a license, citing unidentified FSS officials.  The regulator is reviewing derivative sales and other
operations at three foreign brokerages for compliance with South
Korean rules, it said last month. The FSS began reviewing Credit
Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc’s
local units in late August, MoneyToday reported at the time,
citing unidentified financial industry officials.  Goldman Sachs is “cooperating fully with regulator’s
ongoing inspection and is unaware of any conclusion stemming
from it,” Christoper Jun, a spokesman for the Wall Street firm,
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
