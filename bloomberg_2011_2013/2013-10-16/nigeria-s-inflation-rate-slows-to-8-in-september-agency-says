Nigeria ’s  inflation  rate declined to
8 percent in September, the lowest level since March 2008, as
the harvest season constrained food-price increases, according
to the  National Bureau of Statistics .  Inflation in  Africa ’s largest oil producer slowed from 8.2
percent in August, the Abuja-based statistics agency said today
in an e-mailed statement. The median estimate of nine economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.9 percent. Prices rose 0.75 percent
in the month, the statistics bureau said.  “The recent harvest season continues to constrain rising
food prices,” the NBS said.  Inflation has stayed within the Central Bank of Nigeria’s
target of less than 10 percent this year, as an increase in fuel
prices in 2012 fell out of the calculation and the central bank
regularly sold dollars to support the naira.  The bank has kept its  policy rate  at a record 12 percent
since 2011 to bolster the currency. Governor Lamido Sanusi has
said that high rates are helping to contain prices. He said last
week that inflation is under control and will probably come down
to below 8 percent by December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
