Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper ’s office building in Ottawa was evacuated for several
hours today after police found a suspicious package. One person
was in custody after the incident, police said.  Police cordoned off the block surrounding the Langevin
building across the street from Parliament in Ottawa and a
police vehicle marked “Explosives Unit” was brought to the
scene. The  Royal Canadian Mounted Police  said later in a Twitter
posting the suspicious package wasn’t a threat.  “The Prime Minister was not in the building and we do have
a person of interest in custody,” RCMP Corporal Lucy Shorey
said in a telephone interview.  Harper is attending a reading of a Throne Speech at
Parliament today as the legislature re-opens after a break.  To contact the reporter on this story:
