President  Barack Obama  backs a deal
reached by the Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate
to end the government shutdown and raise the federal debt limit
and would sign it if passed by Congress, his spokesman said.  The deal as outlined by Senate leaders “achieves what is
necessary” to remove the threat of default hanging over the
economy, White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said. Obama
“looks forward to Congress acting so he can sign legislation.”  Without passage, Treasury will exhaust borrowing authority
at the end of the day tomorrow, he said, urging action by the
House and Senate “as soon as possible.” The federal government
has been partially shut down since the Oct. 1 start of the 2014
fiscal year.  Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and his Republican
counterpart,  Mitch McConnell  announced earlier that they reached
a deal. McConnell said they want to pass it today.  Obama may speak about the agreement later today, according
to an administration official, who asked for anonymity to
discuss planning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
