ChargePoint Inc., the largest
operator of charging stations for electric vehicles, is offering
a financing program with  KeyCorp (KEY)  to help businesses and cities
install its systems.  The lease-to-purchase program has no upfront costs for
customers, Campbell, California-based ChargePoint said today in
a statement.  The company’s systems typically cost about $6,000 to
$12,000 to buy. The leases offered through KeyCorp average five
years to seven years and most will cost about $3 to $6 per day,
said Chief Executive Officer Pat Romano. Customers may recoup
the expense by charging users or by promoting them as a service
to attract business. The arrangement is designed to spur wider
deployment of chargers and electric vehicles.  “Eliminating the upfront cost and allowing them to pay for
the device over time, as they’re receiving benefit from the
device, is much easier for many customers,” Romano said in an
interview. The financing program may also benefit municipalities
that want to offer charging capabilities to employees.  ChargePoint has more than 13,500 charging spots in 14
countries, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
