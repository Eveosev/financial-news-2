Portugal ’s borrowing costs rose to
the highest level in 11 months at an auction of 450 million
euros ($610 million) of three-month bills.  The securities due in January 2014 were issued at an
average yield of 1.159 percent, the country’s debt management
agency, or IGCP, said in Lisbon today. That compares with an
average yield of 1.081 percent at a previous auction of three-month bills on Sept. 18 and is the highest since Nov. 21, when
the securities were sold to yield 1.936 percent. The auction
attracted bids for 1.8 times the amount offered, the same bid-to-cover ratio as in September.  Portugal is trying to regain full access to debt markets as
the end of a 78 billion-euro rescue plan from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund  is approaching in June. The
country’s 10-year bond yield has climbed since May, when
borrowing costs were at the lowest since 2010 and the country
last sold bonds.  Portugal’s net financing needs in 2014 will be 11.7 billion
euros, Secretary of State for Treasury Isabel Castelo Branco
said yesterday. The government plans gross bond issuance of 10.5
billion euros next year, while financing from the so-called
troika will be 7.9 billion euros, she said.  The yield on  two-year  notes fell 9 basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 4.15 percent at 11:22 a.m. in  London . Ten-year bond yields slipped 2 basis points to 6.2 percent. The
country, whose debt is ranked below investment grade by all
three major rating companies, pays 3.2 percent on its bailout
loans.  Today, the IGCP also sold 1.05 billion euros of nine-month
bills due in July 2014 at an average yield of 1.714 percent,
attracting bids for 1.5 times the amount offered.  The agency said on Oct. 11 that the total indicative amount
for today’s auctions was between 1.25 billion euros and 1.5
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
