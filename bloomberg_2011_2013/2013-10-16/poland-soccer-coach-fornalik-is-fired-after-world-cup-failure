Poland ’s national soccer coach
Waldemar Fornalik was fired after the country failed to qualify
for next year’s World Cup.  The Polish Football Association  plans to appoint a
replacement within two weeks, Chairman Zbigniew Boniek said at a
televised news conference in Warsaw today. He declined to say
who might replace Fornalik.  Poland’s 1-0 defeat in  Ukraine  on Oct. 11 ended its chances
of qualifying for the World Cup in Brazil, and it lost 2-0 away
to England yesterday. The country came fourth in Group H, behind
England, Ukraine and Montenegro.  Fornalik replaced Franciszek Smuda last year after Poland
finished bottom of its group at the European Championship it co-hosted with Ukraine. Poland most recently featured in the four-yearly  World Cup  in 2006 in Germany.  Yesterday’s result means England qualifies automatically
for Brazil while Ukraine faces a playoff round. Montenegro does
not advance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
