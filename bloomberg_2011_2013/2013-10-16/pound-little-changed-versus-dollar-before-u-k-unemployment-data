The pound strengthened for a third
day against the dollar after a government report showed U.K.
jobless claims dropped the most in 16 years last month amid
signs the labor market is improving.  Sterling reached a one-week high versus the greenback as
the jobless rate held at 7.7 percent in the three months through
August. Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  has said policy
makers won’t consider raising the key  interest rate  from a
record-low 0.5 percent until unemployment falls to 7 percent.
U.S. Senate leaders are struggling to lock down an agreement to
end the fiscal impasse that threatens a default by the world’s
largest economy. U.K. 10-year bonds fell for a third day.  “The follow-through in the pound is pretty limited,” said
David Simmonds, head of currency and emerging-markets strategy
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. in  London . “Markets are
absolutely fixated with watching what’s going on in
 Washington .”  The pound advanced 0.1 percent to $1.6014 at 1:50 p.m.
London time after climbing to $1.6059, the highest level since
Oct. 9. The U.K. currency dropped 0.1 percent to 84.66 pence per
euro after depreciating to 85.10 pence on Oct. 11, the weakest
since Sept. 2.  Claims for jobless benefits fell 41,700, the most since
June 1997, the  Office for National Statistics  said. The decline
exceeded the 25,000 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Unemployment fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million people
in the three months through August.  Jobless Rate  “Things are going the Bank of England’s way, with stronger
employment growth not being reflected in a falling ILO
unemployment rate,”  David Tinsley , an economist at BNP Paribas
SA in London, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  The  jobless rate , as measured by International Labour
Organisation standards, was unchanged from the quarter through
July, the statistics office said.  “Achieving the 7 percent target is still going to be a
challenge,” strategists at Morgan Stanley including  Hans Redeker  in London wrote in a research note. “Hence, we would
expect any pound gains to remain limited.”  The pound appreciated 3.6 percent in the past three months,
the best performer after  New Zealand ’s dollar among 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro strengthened 0.7 percent, while the
 U.S. dollar  slid 2.5 percent.  The benchmark  10-year gilt yield  climbed four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.84 percent after rising to 2.85
percent, the highest level since Sept. 24. The 2.25 percent bond
due in September 2023 fell 0.32, or 3.20 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 94.915.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction 4.75
billion pounds of five-year gilts tomorrow.  Gilts lost 3.6 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries dropped
2.8 percent and German bunds declined 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
