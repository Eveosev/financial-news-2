Copper futures capped the longest
rally since August after the Senate crafted a deal to end a U.S.
fiscal impasse, boosting the outlook for economic growth and
commodities demand.  The Senate and House could vote as soon as today on the
agreement that would end the 16-day-old government shutdown and
increase U.S. borrowing authority, a day before it lapses. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of equities climbed as much as 1.4
percent, while the S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials gained as
much as 1.2 percent.  “I would expect today’s decision to steer funds into
commodities,” Brian Booth, a senior market strategist at Long
Leaf Trading Group in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Copper futures for delivery in December gained less than
0.1 percent to settle at $3.308 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York , a fifth straight increase.  The metal swung between advances and losses today as
traders waited for a conclusion to the U.S. standoff.  Fitch
Ratings  said yesterday it might lower the nation’s AAA credit
rating, citing lawmakers’ inability to agree.  Copper  stockpiles  tracked by the London Metal Exchange fell
for a 30th straight session to 502,750 metric tons, the lowest
since March. That’s the longest slide since 2009.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months added 0.3
percent to $7,260 a ton ($3.29 a pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel and also advanced in  London , while
tin and zinc fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
