Canadian  factory sales  fell in
August as food and automobile production slowed following
maintenance shutdowns.  Sales fell 0.2 percent to C$49.5 billion ($47.7 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, while economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg forecast a 0.2 percent increase. Food
sales fell 1.6 percent to C$7.06 billion and motor vehicles
declined 2.5 percent to C$4.45 billion.  Manufacturing is one of the last major sectors of the
economy that hasn’t returned to levels from before the 2008-2009
recession, hobbled by a strong currency and inconsistent U.S.
demand. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said the
economy lost some production capacity that won’t be recovered
because of the depth of the global slump.  “It looks like a continuation of the overall flat trend in
Canadian manufacturing remains in the cards,” Derek Holt,
Scotiabank’s vice-president of economics in Toronto, wrote in a
note to clients. He cited the 0.1 percent rise in new factory
orders to C$49.8 billion as a sign of weak demand.  Canada ’s dollar gained 0.2 percent to C$1.0366 per U.S.
dollar at 9:40 a.m. in Toronto. One dollar buys 96.47 U.S.
cents.  Sales fell in 11 of 21  categories  tracked by Statistics
Canada accounting for about 40 percent of production, including
a 22.6 percent drop in the miscellaneous category to C$858
million.  Petroleum Sales  Petroleum and coal  product  sales, the second-largest
category by dollar value after transportation equipment, rose
1.0 percent to C$7.25 billion.  Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the
industry’s contribution to economic growth, factory sales fell
0.3 percent.  Unfilled orders  rose for the ninth time in 10 months, by
0.4 percent to C$73.9 billion. Aerospace and parts made up more
than half of those orders at C$42 billion.  Inventories rose 0.3 percent to C$68.9 billion, with the
ratio of factory stockpiles to sales unchanged at 1.39 in
August.  From a year earlier, sales  rose  0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
