House Speaker  John Boehner  will allow a vote on an emerging Senate agreement to end the U.S. fiscal impasse and the agreement will pass, said Representative  Kevin Brady  of Texas, a senior House Republican.  Brady said on Bloomberg Television that he thinks House Republicans’ inability to come up with their plan to raise the debt limit before U.S. borrowing authority lapses tomorrow meant that the House would have to accept whatever Senate leaders come up with.  “This party is not uniting behind our core issues,” Brady said. “As a result, I think we are all frustrated with our ability to impact this overall agreement.”  House leaders haven’t decided whether to vote before the Senate does, said a Republican aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. For procedural reasons, if the House votes first, the bill could reach President  Barack Obama ’s desk more quickly and end the 16-day-old government shutdown.  In the Senate, Majority Leader  Harry Reid  and Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell  are rushing to lock up an agreement to end the fiscal impasse, stepping in after House Republicans’ last-minute plan to avert a U.S. government default collapsed.  The emerging Senate accord may be announced as early as this morning, after one ratings company yesterday placed the U.S.’s AAA credit rating on a negative watch.  The framework being negotiated by Reid and McConnell would fund the government through Jan. 15, 2014, and suspend the  debt limit  until Feb. 7.  Leaders ‘Optimistic’  “Senator Reid and Senator McConnell have re-engaged in negotiations and are optimistic that an agreement is within reach,”  Adam Jentleson , Reid’s spokesman, said in a statement last night. Don Stewart, McConnell’s spokesman, today said the leaders are “still working” on a deal.  In the Senate, Texas Republican  Ted Cruz , who has led a campaign against Obama’s signature health-care law, has left open the possibility of delaying the debt-ceiling measure. If any of the 100 senators chooses to delay it, a vote could be pushed to as late as next week, raising the prospect of a missed payment on the debt.  Employee Furloughs  Reid, a Nevada Democrat, and McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, temporarily suspended talks yesterday while Boehner tried and failed to marshal House Republicans behind a plan that was significantly scaled-down from demands for health-law changes that led to the U.S. government shutdown on Oct. 1.  The partial shutdown has closed national parks, slowed clinical drug trials and led to the furlough of thousands of federal workers.  Fitch Ratings yesterday put the U.S. AAA credit grade on ratings watch negative, citing the government’s inability to raise the debt ceiling in a timely manner, according to a statement after markets in New York closed.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1 percent to 1,715.51 at 10:14 a.m. in New York after sliding 0.7 percent yesterday.  Rates on Treasury bills maturing in the next six weeks fell amid optimism lawmakers are working to resolve the fiscal impasse. Rates on $120 billion of bills maturing tomorrow rose as high as 0.36 percent yesterday before dropping to 0.13 percent.  One-month rates fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 0.27 percent at 10:14 a.m. in New York after touching 0.45 percent, the highest since October 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark 10-year yield rose two basis points to 2.75 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.  Defund, Delay  Under the emerging Senate agreement, House Republicans would get almost none of their priorities. They tried to defund or delay the health-care law, settling last month on trying to delay the requirement that individuals purchase health insurance.  Obama has described those requests as unacceptable ransom demands and insisted that Republicans relent.  Republicans persisted after the partial government shutdown started Oct. 1 and saw their approval ratings drop in polls. Hardliners resisted plans that didn’t make major changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Others, such as Representative  Peter King  of New York, stuck with Boehner while complaining about the strategy.  “And the long teachable moment ends: stove is hot,” Representative  Tim Griffin , an Arkansas Republican, said on Twitter last night after Boehner scrapped the latest plan.  Emerging Agreement  The emerging Senate agreement trades the pressing and already-missed deadlines for new ones over the next four months. The Treasury Department would be allowed to use so-called extraordinary measures to delay default for about another month beyond Feb. 7, said a Senate Democratic aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan.  The Senate accord could include a Republican-backed provision to tighten income verification requirements for people receiving health-insurance subsidies. That provision is linked to a proposal backed by Democrats and labor unions that would delay a reinsurance fee on group health plans.  Both of those health-care provisions will either be in the agreement or be out of the agreement.  Senate passage of a bill could be delayed into late next week if a single senator objects, the aide said. Then that bill would have to go to the House. Procedurally, the Senate would have been able to act by Oct. 18 if the House had passed a bill last night.  Stalling Maneuvers  Cruz, who led a Republican bid to defund Obamacare, spoke for more than 21 hours in a budget debate last month. On Oct. 14, he wouldn’t rule out stalling maneuvers, saying he wants to see the plan’s details. He made no public comments yesterday.  Unless Congress acts, the U.S. will be operating only on about $30 billion of cash reserves and incoming revenue starting tomorrow. It will begin missing promised payments between Oct. 22 and Oct. 31, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Boehner has tried several times over the past month to construct a debt-limit bill that House Republicans could support, and he hasn’t brought any proposals to a vote. Republicans didn’t have enough votes for the measure yesterday, said a leadership aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss vote counting.  Unlike previous stopgap spending measures, the House bill wouldn’t have made big changes to the 2010 health-care law, and it contains no cuts to entitlement programs that Republicans sought to add to a debt-limit increase or spending bill.  Democratic Leader  Nancy Pelosi  of California said the proposal is a path to default and urged Boehner to support a bipartisan agreement emerging in the Senate.  “We’re at the 11th hour here,” said Senator  Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat. “The train to avoid default was smoothly heading down the tracks and picking up speed, and all of a sudden at the last minute, Speaker Boehner decides to throw a log on those tracks. Enough already.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Richard Rubin in Washington at  rrubin12@bloomberg.net ; Kathleen Hunter in Washington at  khunter9@bloomberg.net ; Roxana Tiron in Washington at  rtiron@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jodi Schneider at  jschneider50@bloomberg.net
