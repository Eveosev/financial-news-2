Matt Holliday  and Shane Robinson hit
home runs and the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Los Angeles
Dodgers 4-2 to move within one win of reaching the World Series.  The Cardinals took a three-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series with the victory
tonight at Dodger Stadium. St. Louis can finish off the series
in Game 5 tomorrow afternoon at Los Angeles.  In the American League,  Mike Napoli ’s seventh-inning home
run gave the Boston Red Sox a 1-0 win against the Detroit Tigers
and a two-games-to-one series lead. The game was interrupted for
17 minutes when a cable failure caused lights to go out in the
second inning at Detroit’s Comerica Park.  At Los Angeles, the Cardinals took a 3-0 lead in the third
inning on a run-scoring double by Matt Carpenter and a two-run
homer by Holliday. The Dodgers got two runs in the fourth on
run-scoring singles by Yasiel Puig and A.J. Ellis.  St. Louis  made it 4-2 in the seventh on a solo home run by
pinch-hitter Robinson.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
