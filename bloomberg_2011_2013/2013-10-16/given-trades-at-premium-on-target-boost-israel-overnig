Given Imaging Ltd. (GIVN) , the Israeli
maker of swallowable cameras, surged to a two-year high in New
York to trade at a premium to its  Tel Aviv  shares as Maxim Group
LLC raised its stock-price estimate.  The Yokneam, Israel-based company jumped 3.4 percent
yesterday to $20.97, or 74.28 shekels, to trade at a 43-cent
premium to its stock in Tel Aviv. The shares led gains on the
Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the most-traded companies in
the U.S., which rose 0.7 percent to 100.69.  Allot Communications
Ltd. (ALLT)  had the largest discount versus its Tel Aviv stock among
dual-listed companies.  Bryan Brokmeier, an analyst at Maxim, raised his estimate
for Given by 17 percent to $27 and expects U.S. approval for the
PillCam Colon 2 in November. Heâ€™s ranked first among the six
analysts covering Given after his recommendations produced the
best relative returns, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
stock will rise 27 percent to $26.67 in the next 12 months, the
highest target since 2008, according to the average estimate of
three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Dual-listed Arbitrages:  Tel Aviv stocks trading at the largest premium versus  New York
