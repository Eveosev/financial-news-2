 Taiwan dollar forwards declined the
most in three weeks on speculation investors will sell the
currency as the deadline for raising the U.S. debt ceiling
approaches. Government bonds rose.  U.S. lawmakers must reach an agreement before the nation’s
borrowing authority lapses tomorrow. Senate leaders are resuming
talks aimed at avoiding a default and ending the 15-day
government shutdown after the Republican-controlled House of
Representatives scrapped a vote on its plan. Taiwan posted a
current-account surplus of $13.8 billion in the second quarter.  “As we approach the deadline, there may be some profit-taking across” Asian currencies, said  Frances Cheung , Hong
Kong-based senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. Taiwan’s
currency will be relatively stable because it has a high
current-account surplus and there are no concerns about large
bond outflows, she said.  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.2 percent to
NT$29.335 per U.S. dollar as of 10:56 a.m. in Taipei, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest drop since
Sept. 24.  In the spot market, the local dollar rose 0.1 percent to
NT$29.415 against the greenback, prices from Taipei Forex Inc.
show. The currency slid 0.3 percent in the last 16 minutes of
trading yesterday amid suspected intervention by the central
bank. The monetary authority has sold the local dollar in the
run-up to the close on most days since March 2012, according to
traders who asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, dropped six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, today to 3.48 percent.  The yield on the 1.25 percent government notes due October
2018, the most actively traded bonds this week, decreased one
basis point today to 1.157 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady today at
0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
