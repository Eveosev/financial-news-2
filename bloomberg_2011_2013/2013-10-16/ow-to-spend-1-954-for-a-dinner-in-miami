Since its grand opening in 1954, the iconic  Fontainebleau Hotel  on Miami Beach has been a magnet for celebrities—from classic Hollywood heavyweights like Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, to modern-day pop stars like Miley Cyrus. To celebrate its upcoming 60th birthday, the famed hotel has created the " 1954 Dining Experience "—a one-of-a-kind upscale culinary experience that's worth a whopping $1,954 for a single meal. "The 1954 Dining Experience celebrates the Fontainebleau's history with an evening that captures the glamour of the past, the allure of the present, and a vision of tomorrow," said chef de cuisine Derrick Roberts. The meal, fashioned by  Gotham Steak  executive chef Alfred Portale, begins with a bottle of Louis Roderer Cristal champagne, followed by several courses of Petrossian Royal Osetra Caviar, Alaskan King Crab, and fresh oysters (from both coasts). Afterward, you'll enjoy chilled steamed lobster, which serves only to prepare you for the protein  de résistance —a 12-ounce Japanese Wagyu strip steak, served, naturally, with a savory lineup of decadent side dishes and sauces. Diners who've saved room for dessert will indulge in an artisanal cheese selection plus two sweet treats created especially for this dinner by Fontainebleau's award-winning pastry-making staff. Like any special occasion meal, this one concludes with a nightcap—post-meal, a personal concierge will escort you to the hotel’s famous, celebrity-studded LIV nightclub (Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, and Kanye West are among LIV’s regulars). "The evening is an over-the-top night on the town that brings you back to a time when Frank Sinatra dined at the resort,” explained Roberts. “It’s definitely a night to remember!” And at $1,954 a plate, it certainly should be.
