Honduran President Porfirio Lobo
declared a national holiday today after the Central American
country’s soccer team snatched a  World Cup  berth with a 2-2 tie
against Jamaica.  Honduras joined fellow Latin American teams Chile and
Ecuador in qualifying for the 2014 soccer championship
yesterday, the first time the country of eight million people
won two consecutive spots in the World Cup finals. Honduras last
qualified in 2009, when the country was divided over a coup that
ousted former president  Manuel Zelaya . Before that, Honduras
hadn’t reached the finals of the tournament since 1982.  “We’ve won and Honduras is going to the 2014 World Cup, we
can celebrate this historic day for our great nation,” Lobo
said in a statement following the victory.  In the 2010 finals in South Africa, Honduras was eliminated
in the first round after losing to Chile, Spain and Switzerland.
In 1982, they failed to advance after tying with Northern
Ireland and Spain and losing to Yugoslavia.  Honduras’s victory forces Mexico into a playoff against New
Zealand in order to qualify for its sixth straight World Cup in
Brazil next year.   To contact the reporter on this story:
