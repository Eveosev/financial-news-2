Abbott Laboratories (ABT) , which split
into two companies this year, reported third-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates on increased demand for its diagnostic
tests.  The company also raised its  quarterly dividend  by more than
half, to 22 cents a share from 14 cents. Earnings excluding one-time items of 55 cents a share beat by 4 cents the average of 20
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue increased 2 percent to $5.37 billion from a year
earlier, the Abbott Park, Illinois-based company said in a
statement today. The diagnostics area rose 11 percent,
outperforming company expectations, Abbott said. Abbott was able
to grab more diagnostics business especially in infectious
disease testing, said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones &
Co. in  St. Louis .  “All three diagnostics segments -- core lab, molecular and
point of care -- they have all had good growth,” Windau said.
“It’s broad-based.”  The company reiterated its 2013  earnings  forecast of $1.98
to $2.04 a share.  Profit (STJ)  from continuing operations more than
doubled to $773 million, or 49 cents a share, from $339 million,
or 21 cents, a year earlier, the company said.  Abbott shares rose 6.5 percent to $35.90 at 4:02 p.m.  New
York  time. The stock has gained 15 percent this  year .  The drug business was split off into a new company,  AbbVie
Inc. (ABBV) , based in North Chicago,  Illinois , on Jan. 1. Abbott
retained the original company’s medical devices, nutritional
products, diagnostic tests and generic drugs. AbbVie, which will
report earnings on Oct. 25, kept the brand name drugs, including
the best-selling Humira for rheumatoid arthritis.  Abbott’s third-quarter net income fell 50 percent to $966
million from a year earlier, when the company hadn’t yet divided
in two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
