Former U.S. Secretary of State
 Condoleezza Rice  is on the 13-member committee that will pick
the four teams for college football’s playoffs beginning next
season.  University of Arkansas Athletic Director Jeff Long was
named chairman of the College Football Playoff selection
committee two days ago. Rice, now a professor at  Stanford
University  in Stanford,  California , and the 12 other members
were unanimously chosen by the athletic directors of conferences
that are overseeing the new system, Bill Hancock, the playoff’s
executive director, said in an e-mailed statement.  Other members are athletic directors Barry Alvarez of
Wisconsin, Oliver Luck of West Virginia, Dan Radakovich of
Clemson and Pat Haden of Southern California; former Air Force
Academy Superintendent Mike Gould; Tom Jernstedt, a former
National Collegiate Athletic Association executive vice
president; former National Football League quarterback Archie Manning; former Nebraska coach and athletic director Tom Osborne; former Big East Conference Commissioner Mike Tranghese;
former USA Today college football reporter Steve Wieberg; and
former Notre Dame coach Tyrone Willingham.  The members generally will serve terms of three years,
meeting several times during the season and on selection
weekend, while given “flexibility to examine whatever data they
believe is relevant to inform their decisions,” according to
the statement.  The first playoff championship game will be held on Jan.
12, 2015, at AT&T Stadium in Arlington,  Texas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
