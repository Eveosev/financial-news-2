Twitter Inc. has hired a  Google Inc. (GOOG) 
advertising executive to be head of retail, as the company ramps
up hiring and works to expand its business ahead of an initial
public offering.  J.J. Hirschle, who directed media and entertainment
advertising at Google, will be responsible for the team selling
advertising products to retail companies, Will Stickney, a
spokesman for Twitter, said yesterday. He starts Oct. 28.  The hire comes as Twitter builds up its advertising
business by reaching out to retailers, among others. The San
Francisco-based company, which is preparing to go public in the
most-anticipated U.S. technology offering since  Facebook Inc. (FB) 
last year, has disclosed in its S-1 prospectus that it is
growing revenue from advertising, even as it remains
unprofitable.  Twitter has been hiring quickly to beef up its workforce
and expand its business. In a filing this week, the company said
it added 300 employees in the third quarter, for a total of
2,300. Twitter has been in talks to lease a 320,000-square-foot
 office space  adjacent to its San Francisco headquarters as it
grows, people with knowledge of the discussions have said.  Twitter has poached from Google before. Last year, Twitter
hired Shailesh Rao, who had been leading Googleâ€™s display-advertising sales in  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
