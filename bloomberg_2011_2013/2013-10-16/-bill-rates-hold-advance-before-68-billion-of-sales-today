Rates on Treasury bills tumbled and
yields on government notes and bonds fell as lawmakers reached a
tentative agreement to raise the nation’s borrowing capacity and
remove the risk of default.  Rates on $120 billion of bills maturing tomorrow, when
Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has said the U.S. will exhaust
measures being used to keep the government funded, dropped to
0.035 percent after touching 0.36 percent. Optimism an agreement
is at hand bolstered demand at today’s auctions of $68 billion
of four- and 52-week bills and of 189-day cash management
securities in what could have been the Treasury’s last
opportunity to bring in new cash under the debt limit.  “Today’s outcome was the best option amongst a set of bad
options,”  Zach Pandl , a senior interest-rate strategist in
 Minneapolis  at Columbia Management Investment Advisers, which
oversees $340 billion, said in a telephone interview. “Most
investors would agree that a much longer-term agreement would be
better for markets and the economy, but we will take what we can
get. The Treasury market is appropriately valued at the
moment.”  One-month rates fell 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage
point, to 0.14 percent at 5 p.m. in New York after touching 0.45
percent, the highest since October 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The benchmark  10-year note yield  fell six basis points to
2.67 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price
of the 2.5 percent note due in August 2023 rose 17/32, or $5.31
per $1,000 face value, to 98 19/32.  Washington ‘Dysfunction’  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose 44 percent to $384
billion, from $267 billion yesterday. The average this year is
$316 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index dropped to 73, the lowest level since
Aug. 5. It climbed on Sept. 5 to 114.2, the highest level in two
months. It touched a record low 49 in May.  “They are kicking the can down the road again,” said
 Kevin Giddis , senior managing director and head of fixed income
in  Memphis  at Raymond James & Associates Inc. “It’s the
dysfunction of  Washington  these days. We are going to turn our
focus back to what’s driving the economy, plus the effect of 16
days of a partial shutdown. It will have some minor effect,
which is why you are getting a rally in Treasuries.”  Treasury bills rates rose to recent highs amid concern the
U.S. may default on its debt or delay payments to debt holders
if Congress was unable to agree on a plan to increase the debt
ceiling by tomorrow’s deadline.  Paying Bills  The rate on $120 billion of Treasury bills maturing
tomorrow fell 28 basis points today after touching 0.51 percent
on Oct. 10, the highest since they were sold a year earlier. The
rate fell as low as negative 0.02 percent, the first time it
crossed below zero since Sept. 26.  The Treasury should have enough money to pay off the Oct.
17 bills, according to Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist
in  New York  at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of the 21 primary
dealer obligated to bid at Treasury auctions. The U.S. raised
$13 billion in “new cash” this week, which should leave the
government with about $40 billion once the Oct. 17 securities
mature, he said.  Historically Low  The next securities due after the Oct. 17 debt are $93
billion of debt maturing on Oct. 24. Rates on those bills
touched 0.68 percent today, the highest since they were sold in
April, before dropping by 28 basis points back to 0.19 percent.
The rate was negative as recently as Sept. 27.  Rates remain lower than historical levels, with one-month
 rates  averaging 1.5 percent in the past 10 years. During that
time they climbed to a high of 5.26 percent in November 2006 and
fell to as little as negative 0.09 percent in December 2008.  Two years ago, one-month rates climbed to a then-29-month
high of 0.18 percent as the Aug. 2, 2011, deadline set by
Treasury to avoid a default approached. They traded at negative
0.046 percent in December 2012 before a year-end trigger that
forced automatic spending cuts and tax increases.  The shutdown has shaved at least 0.6 percent off annualized
fourth-quarter 2013 gross domestic product growth, or taken $24
billion out of the economy,  Standard & Poor’s  said today. The
ratings agency downgraded the U.S. on Aug. 5, 2011 to AA+ from
AAA.  Economic Growth  The  U.S. economy  is forecast to grow 2.4 percent in the
fourth quarter, according to the median estimate of 68
economists and strategists in a Bloomberg News survey completed
Oct. 4 to 9.  The difference between what banks and the Treasury pay to
borrow money for one month, known as the TED spread, inverted
last week for the first time since Bloomberg started collecting
the data in 2001. The gauge was at four basis points today.  The Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Index has
fallen 2.8 percent this year, heading for its first annual
decline since 2009.  Today’s auction of $20 billion of four-week bills drew a
rate of 0.24 percent, down from 0.35 percent at the last sale on
Oct. 8 and up from an average of 0.07 percent at the past 10
sales. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
the amount bid with the amount offered, was 4.33, up from 2.75
at the previous sale that was the lowest since March 2009.  ‘Risking Default’  The $22 billion of 52-week securities drew a rate of 0.16
percent, up from 0.12 percent at the last auction on Sept. 17
and an average of 0.13 at the previous 10 sales. The bid-to-cover ratio fell to 4.12 from 4.51.  The $26 billion 189-day cash-management bills sold with a
rate of 0.135 percent and a bid-cover ratio of 3.83. The bills
are used to meet the Treasury’s short-term cash needs in
addition to the funds raised at regularly scheduled sales of
bills and notes. Cash bills aren’t offered regularly and their
maturities vary from auction to auction.  “The bill auction results on the margin reflect the idea
that a debt-ceiling deal is somewhat more likely in light of the
headlines,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at
CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “People will be
hypersensitive to headlines as the debt ceiling deadline looms.
It’s generally understood that the U.S. has a few more days
before risking default.”  A $35 billion sale of three-month debt yesterday drew  bids 
for 3.13 times the amount offered, the lowest level since July
2009. The  figure  was 3.52 at a $30 billion auction of six-month
bills, the least since October 2009.  The overnight Treasury general collateral repo rate closed
at 0.35 percent after opening at 0.30 percent, according to ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker. It’s almost four
times the 0.09 percent open at the start of last week.  The Fed purchased $1.46 billion in Treasuries maturing from
February 2036 to August 2043 as part of its program to lower
borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
