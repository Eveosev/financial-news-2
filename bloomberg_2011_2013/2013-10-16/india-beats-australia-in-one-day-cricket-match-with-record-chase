India  produced the second-highest
run chase in one-day international cricket to rout Australia by
nine wickets and tie their seven-match series at 1-1.  Virat Kohli smashed the fastest one-day century by an
Indian player off 52 deliveries as the home team surged past the
target of 360 with 39 balls to spare in Jaipur yesterday. Rohit
Sharma struck the winning runs to finish 141 not out after
Shikhar Dhawan made 95.  India’s total of 362-1 trails only  South Africa ’s 438-9
against Australia in 2006 as the highest successful run chase in
elite one-day cricket. Australia has now conceded the four
highest one-day chases of all time.  “That was some pretty awesome batting,”  Australia  captain
George Bailey said at the post-match presentation. “It felt
like everything we tried with the ball just seemed to go harder
and further.”  A total of 23 sixes and 75 fours were hit during the match.
Australia amassed 359-5 after winning the toss as its top-five
batsmen all passed 50 -- the first such instance in one-day
internationals. Bailey top scored with 92 not out and Phillip Hughes hit 83.  Australia won the series opener by 72 runs. The third match
is in two days in Mohali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
