An ex- Maxwell Technologies Inc. (MXWL) 
executive was charged by U.S. prosecutors with conspiring to
bribe Chinese officials and falsifying company records in
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  Alain Riedo, the former general manager of a Swiss unit of
the company, was charged yesterday in an indictment in  San Diego 
with taking part in a six-year conspiracy to pay government
officials in China to win contracts to sell electric  storage
devices  known as capacitors.  Riedo, through a sales agent in China, paid the bribes by
adding a “secret mark-up” of about 20 percent to the price
customers paid for the capacitors, according to the indictment.
The extra amounts were paid to employees of state-owned and
state-controlled companies, prosecutors said.  Two years ago, Maxwell Technologies entered into a deferred
prosecution agreement with the U.S. and agreed to pay more than
$14 million to resolve  Justice Department  and Securities and
Exchange Commission probes of the San Diego-based company’s
conduct in China.  Peter Carr , a Justice Department spokesman, said Riedo, a
Swiss citizen, remains at large.  Riedo didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the indictment.  Michael Sund, a spokesman for Maxwell Technologies, said
that the company’s liability insurance will pay for Riedo’s
defense. Other than that, the company has had no involvement
with Riedo since he left in 2009, Sund said in an interview.  The case is U.S. v. Riedo, 13-cr-03789, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of California (San Diego).  To contact the reporter on this story:
