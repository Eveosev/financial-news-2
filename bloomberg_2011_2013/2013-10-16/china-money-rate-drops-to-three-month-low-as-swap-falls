China ’s benchmark money-market rate
declined to the lowest level in three months, spurring
speculation the central bank will revert to draining funds from
the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China asked local lenders to submit
orders for 28-day repurchase contracts, 91-day bills, and 14-day
reverse repos planned for tomorrow, according to a trader at a
primary dealer required to bid at the auctions. The PBOC hasn’t
issued repos, or contracts used to siphon off funds, since June.
The central bank added 10 billion  yuan  ($1.6 billion) to the
market via seven-day reverse-repos yielding 3.9 percent
yesterday, after injecting a net 33 billion yuan last week.  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the banking system, declined 54 basis points, or
0.54 percentage point, to 3.31 percent as of 10:35 a.m. in
 Shanghai , according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. It touched 3.3 percent, the
lowest level since July 18.  “There are sufficient funds in the market,” said Guo Caomin, an analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai. “Given
the current situation, it’s possible for the PBOC to resume repo
sales. It may start with repos, before using the bills.”  The central bank has refrained from selling repo contracts
since June, when money-market rates surged to record highs. It
started to rollover maturing three-year bonds in July to
maintain funds in the financial system and last  reissued  5.5
billion yuan on Oct. 14 at 3.5 percent.  Swaps Drop  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed payment to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, fell six basis points
to 3.88 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 12, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 4.08 percent bonds due August 2023 was
little changed at 4.13 percent, the highest since Sept. 13,
according to data from the Interbank Funding Center.  Premier  Li Keqiang  said the nation can keep 2013 inflation
at about 3.5 percent, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
yesterday. Consumer prices rose 3.1 percent in September from a
year earlier, faster than the 2.6 percent gain in August and the
median estimate of 2.8 percent in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
