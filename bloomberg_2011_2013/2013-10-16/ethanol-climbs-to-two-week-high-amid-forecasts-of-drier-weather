Ethanol futures climbed to a two-week high amid signals of buying from refiners and as drier
weather later this week is expected to boost supplies of corn.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 2.6 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $1.810 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade at
11:30 a.m.  New York  time, paring this year’s losses to 17
percent. It was the highest price since Oct. 3. The U.S. harvest
is expected to pick up later this week as fields dry, MDA
Weather Services said yesterday.  “It’s all about corn, cheap corn available,” Jim Damask,
a manager at Starfuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida , said in a
telephone interview. “Also, there are signals of refiners
buying ethanol amid low inventories.”  November-gasoline advanced 4.23 cents, or 1.6 percent, to
$2.7021 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for December settlement declined 2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $4.415 a bushel in  Chicago . Prices have slumped 37
percent this year, the worst performance amid 44 commodities
tracked by Bloomberg, as the U.S. is harvesting a record crop
estimated at 13.8 billion bushels. Corn is the primary component
in U.S.-made ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
