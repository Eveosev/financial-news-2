The  New England Patriots  lost
linebacker Jerod Mayo for the rest of the season due to injury,
leaving them without a defensive captain who has led the team in
tackles since his rookie year in 2008.  The Patriots placed Mayo, 27, on season-ending injured
reserve today without disclosing the nature of his injury. The
Boston Globe, citing an unidentified person familiar with the
situation,  reported  that Mayo tore a pectoral muscle in the
Patriots’ 30-27 win over the New Orleans Saints last weekend.  The loss of Mayo, the 10th pick in the 2008 National
Football League draft, leaves the Patriots without both of their
defensive captains. Defensive tackle Vince Wilfork, a five-time
Pro Bowl selection, was put on injured reserve two weeks ago
with a torn Achilles tendon.  Mayo had a team-leading 55 tackles this season for the
Patriots, who lead the American Football Conference’s East
Division with a 5-1 record.  New England  visits the division-rival  New York  Jets (3-3) this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
