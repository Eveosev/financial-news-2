The U.K.’s oat harvest may be the
largest in about 40 years after farmers boosted planting this
spring, according to the Agriculture & Horticulture Development
Board.  Production may be 850,000 to 1 million metric tons, the
highest since the late 1970s, said Helen Plant, a senior analyst
at the Kenilworth, England-based AHDB. Excess rain last autumn
meant farmers couldn’t plant some winter crops including wheat
and rapeseed, leaving fields available to be sown with spring
crops including oats. The Department for Environment, Food &
Rural Affairs will release its first estimate on this season’s
oat production tomorrow.  “Production levels will give us a potentially large
surplus to go into  animal feed , exports or stocks,” Plant said
in an interview yesterday at the AHDB’s outlook conference in
London. “The big EU exporters are Finland and  Sweden , and
they’re expecting larger crops than last year.  Spain , which has
been a traditional export market, had a much better crop than
last year, so their import requirements are going to be lower.”  Milling demand for oats in the U.K. usually totals about
500,000 tons, Plant said. Farmers in the U.K. were expected to
harvest oats on 159,000 hectares (392,898 acres), up 32 percent
from last year, the AHDB said in August. In 2012, U.K. oat
production was 627,000 tons, according to Defra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
