MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the home-loan
guarantor that posted losses for six straight years tied to the
housing crash, led a rally of mortgage insurers after reporting
a second straight quarterly profit.  MGIC  surged  15 percent to $8.33 at 4:01 p.m. in  New York .
The Milwaukee-based firm has tripled this year. Rival  Radian
Group Inc. (RDN)  advanced 7.7 percent, and has more than doubled since
Dec. 31.  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , which also sells  life
insurance , climbed 3.6 percent.  Net income  was $12.1 million in the third quarter, compared
with a loss of $246.9 million a year earlier, as fewer
homeowners fell behind on mortgage payments, and rising home
prices cushioned losses, MGIC said in a statement today.
Mortgage insurers cover losses when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  “The favorable economic trends we have been benefiting
from relative to home-price appreciation and employment over the
last several quarters have continued,” MGIC Chief Executive
Officer Curt Culver said in the statement.  Home prices  in 20 U.S. cities rose by the most in more than
seven years in the 12 months through July, increasing 12.4
percent from a year earlier, according to the  S&P/Case-Shiller
index. (SPCS20)  The  unemployment rate  fell to 7.3 percent in August, the
lowest level since 2008.  MGIC sold coverage on $8.6 billion of home loans, compared
with $7 billion in the same period a year earlier. The insurance
is typically required when borrowers pay less than 20 percent of
the cost of a home up front.  To contact the reporter on this story:
