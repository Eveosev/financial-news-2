Euro-area inflation  slowed for a
second month in September, led by falling energy prices, and
remained below the  European Central Bank ’s 2 percent ceiling for
an eighth month.  Consumer prices rose an annual 1.1 percent after a 1.3
percent increase in August, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. That’s in line with Eurostat’s
 preliminary estimate  on Sept. 30. In the month, prices increased
0.5 percent.  The ECB forecasts that inflation will average 1.5 percent
this year and 1.3 percent in 2014. Central bank President  Mario Draghi  on Oct. 2 reaffirmed his pledge to keep key  interest
rates  “at present or lower levels for an extended period of
time,” based in part on “an unchanged overall subdued outlook
for inflation extending into the medium term.”  “We have a relatively weak business cycle in some
countries of the  euro zone , for example Spain, Italy, Greece and
 Portugal , and there’s no possibility to push through cost
increases,” said Stefan Muetze, an economist at Helaba in
Frankfurt. “For the European Central Bank, of course, it’s
okay, because they don’t have to increase interest rates.”  Energy prices in the euro area fell 0.9 percent after a 0.3
percent decline in August, today’s report showed. The cost of
food, alcohol and tobacco increased 2.6 percent after a 3.2
percent gain a month earlier. The core inflation rate, which
excludes volatile food and energy costs, was 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
