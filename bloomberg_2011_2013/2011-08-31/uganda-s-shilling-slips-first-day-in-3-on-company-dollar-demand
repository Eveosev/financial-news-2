Uganda’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency in 2011, weakened for the first day in
three against the dollar as companies bought the U.S. currency
to pay for raw materials.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
depreciated 0.4 percent to 2,822 per dollar at 2:54 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, according to Bloomberg data. The shilling fell
as low as 2,830 on Aug. 26, the weakest level since 1993.  “There was some demand for the dollar from the
manufacturing sector,” Faisal Bukenya, the head of  currency
trading  at Barclays Bank of Uganda Ltd., said by phone from
Kampala. “The demand is tapering but there is still subdued
inflows of the dollar.”  The shilling has slumped 18 percent this year against the
dollar, making it the world’s worst-performing currency during
the period. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to
a more than 18-year high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8
percent in July, the  Uganda  Bureau of Statistics said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
