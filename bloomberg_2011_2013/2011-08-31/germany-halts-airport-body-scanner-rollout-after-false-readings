Germany  has postponed a rollout of
full-body scanners at its airports after two of the machines
deployed for testing in Hamburg gave too many false readings.  The scanners won’t be installed throughout German airports
for the time being while police continue to develop and improve
them, the country’s  interior ministry  said today in a statement.  Some 809,000 people voluntarily opted to try the machines
during a 10-month test phase in Hamburg, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
