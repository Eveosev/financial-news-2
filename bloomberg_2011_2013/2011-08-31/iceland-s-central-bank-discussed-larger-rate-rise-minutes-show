Members of the Icelandic  central
bank ’s policy board discussed keeping the island’s benchmark
rate unchanged or raising it by as much as 0.5 percentage
points, according to minutes of the bank’s Aug. 16 rate meeting,
published today.  “The governor proposed that the bank’s interest rates be
raised by 0.25 percentage points,” the minutes showed, and
increases of as much as 0.5 percentage points were also
discussed.  “Three committee members supported the governor’s
proposal. One committee member voted against the governor’s
proposal and would have preferred to delay the decision on
policy tightening until the committee’s meeting in September.”  The bank raised the benchmark seven-day collateral lending
rate to 4.5 percent from 4.25 percent on Aug. 17, to combat
escalating inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
