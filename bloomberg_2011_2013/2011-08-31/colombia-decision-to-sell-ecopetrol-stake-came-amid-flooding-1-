Colombia ’s Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said the announcement to sell a government
stake in oil company  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  was “an attack of
impatience” sparked by last year’s flooding crisis.  Echeverry, speaking to lawmakers in Bogota, said the sale
of as much as 10 percent will go ahead and be used to fund
infrastructure projects. The decision to sell came as torrential
rains caused thousands of Colombians to lose their homes in the
flooding, and the government needed funds to help victims and
pay for repairs, he said.  “We saw thousands of Colombians with water to their
necks,” Echeverry said in Congress today. “That was the driver
of our impatience. We needed to find resources” to help the
flood victims.  President  Juan Manuel Santos  has said he will sell the
government’s stake over four years. The company, in a share sale
separate to the government’s, said Aug. 24 it received orders
for about 2.4 trillion pesos ($1.35 billion) of stock that will
go toward boosting production.  Ecopetrol fell 15 pesos, or 0.4 percent, to 3,855 pesos in
Bogota trading today.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
