Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3) ,
 Brazil ’s fourth-largest real-estate company by revenue, surged
to a one-month high as homebuilders gained on speculation the
central bank will cut  interest rates .  Brookfield jumped 5.9 percent to 7 reais in Sao Paulo
trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. The benchmark Bovespa index
advanced 2 percent on speculation the central bank will cut
interest rates.  Brookfield has gained 32 percent since Aug. 8 as bets for a
cut in Brazil’s benchmark interest rate have grown. Speculation
the central bank will lower borrowing costs as soon as today was
fueled by a report that showed industrial output in Brazil rose
less than economists forecast in July.  “Homebuilders had been overly punished. and with sentiment
about Brazil turning some because of rates, Brookfield and other
homebuilders have been rebounding,” Marcello Milman, an analyst
at Banco BTG Pactual SA, said in a phone interview from  Sao
Paulo .  Milman rates Brookfield a “buy” with a 12-month price
target of 9 reais. Brookfield reported on Aug. 12 second-quarter
net income of 78.2 million reais ($49 million), up 27 percent
from the same period last year.  Brookfield on Aug. 12 lowered its 2011 forecast for new
projects to no more than 4.2 billion reais, from a previous
estimate of as much as 5.25 billion reais. Brookfield also cut
its 2012 new projects guidance to a range of 4.25 billion reais
to 4.75 billion reais.  The  BM&FBovespa Real Estate (IMOBBV)  Index reached its highest level
in more than a month after advancing 2.9 percent. PDG Realty SA
Empreendimentos & Participacoes, Brazil’s biggest homebuilder by
revenue, gained 3.7 percent to 7.83 reais, and  Rossi Residencial
SA (RSID3) , Brazil’s sixth-biggest homebuilder by revenue, jumped 2.3
percent to 12.20 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
