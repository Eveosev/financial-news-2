Cape Plc (CIU) , a supplier of scaffolding,
fire protection and cleaners to energy companies, increased its
dividend on expectations it will win contracts in Asia.  Cape raised its first-half payout to 4.5 pence a share from
4 pence a year earlier and may keep that level this half, Chief
Executive Officer Martin May said in a phone interview. Profit
before tax in the first six months slipped 13 percent to 28.6
million pounds ($47 million) from 32.7 million pounds.  The company, which counts BP Plc,  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM)  and
 Chevron Corp (CVX)  as clients, is working on liquefied natural gas
plants in Australia supplying fuel to Japan after that country’s
nuclear meltdown boosted demand for gas. Uxbridge, England-based
Cape has risen 78 percent to 480 pence in London trading in the
past twelve months.  “We’re confident that we’ll win major projects in our Far
East business,” May said. “Our confidence in the second half
is underpinned by increasing the dividend.”  Cape gets about half its sales from maintenance operations,
mainly in the U.K. The other half is from construction support,
focused on Asia, Australia, the  Middle East  and the Caspian Sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
