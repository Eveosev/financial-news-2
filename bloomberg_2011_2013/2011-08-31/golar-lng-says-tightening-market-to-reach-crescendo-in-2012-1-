Golar LNG Ltd. (GOL)  expects the
tightening market for shipping liquefied natural gas will reach
a crescendo next year, Chief Executive Officer Doug Arnell said
at a conference in Oslo.  "One-year rates next year could easily be over $120,000
per day," he said today in a subsequent interview. "The peak in
the market is coming 2012 and 2013. As new-build order book
vessels start being delivered itâ€™ll probably come off a little
bit after that but remain strong for the next 5-6 years."  To contact the reporter on this story:
