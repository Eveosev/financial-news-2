Joy Global Inc. (JOYG) , a manufacturer of
mining equipment, rose after increasing its full-year profit
forecast following the $1.1 billion acquisition of LeTourneau
Technologies Inc.  Joy climbed $5.31, or 6.4 percent, to $87.85 on the Nasdaq
Stock Market at 9:45 a.m. in New York.  Profit will be $5.70 to $6 a share this fiscal year
compared with a previous prediction of $5.30 to $5.60,
Milwaukee-based Joy said today in a statement. It also raised
its sales forecast to $4.3 million to $4.5 billion, from $4.1
billion to $4.3 billion.  “Commodity and energy fundamentals remain intact despite
expectations of slowing industrial production and global
economic growth,” Joy said in the statement. “We have not
encountered any instances of projects being deferred, delayed or
de-prioritized.”  LeTourneau’s mining unit will help boost profits, Joy said.
The company agreed to sell LeTourneau’s drilling unit to Cameron
International Corp. for $375 million, according to a separate
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
