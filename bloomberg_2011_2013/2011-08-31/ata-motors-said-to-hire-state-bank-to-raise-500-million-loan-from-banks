Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the Indian owner
of Jaguar Land Rover, hired  State Bank  of India to help it
borrow $500 million in a term loan, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The two-part facility consists of a $200 million portion
which matures in five years and a $300 million portion which
matures in seven, the person said, asking not to be identified
as details are private.  Lenders committing $20 million or more to the five-year
loan will receive margin and fees for a so-called all-in payment
of 260 basis points more than the  London  interbank offered rate
while those contributing that amount or more to the seven-year
facility will receive a rate of 280 basis points more than
Libor, the person said. Tata Motors will use the proceeds for
general corporate purposes, the person said.  Meetings to market the loan to other lenders will be held
in Taipei on Sept. 5, Singapore on Sept. 6 and London on Sept.
21, the person said. Other meetings may also be arranged in
Dubai, the person said.  State Bank of India (SBIN)  expects to complete syndication in mid
October and Tata Motors will likely sign the loan later that
month, the person said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
