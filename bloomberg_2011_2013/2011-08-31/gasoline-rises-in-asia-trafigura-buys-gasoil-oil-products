Gasoline rose in  Asia  after
PetroChina Co. bought two cargoes in Singapore. Trafigura Beheer
BV purchased 250,000 barrels of gasoil at a bigger discount than
those for smaller cargoes bought by ConocoPhillips and Brightoil
Petroleum Holdings.  Middle Distillates  Trafigura bought 250,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5 percent
sulfur from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at a discount of 60 cents
below benchmark prices, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
traders monitoring the Platts window today. That compares with a
discount of 40 cents below benchmark quotes that Singapore
Petroleum Co. paid BP Plc for 150,000 barrels.  Hin Leong Trading Pte also sold 150,000 barrels to
ConocoPhillips at a discount of 40 cents. The privately owned
 Singapore  trader sold 150,000 barrels to Brightoil at a discount
of 35 cents.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude fell 27 cents to $17.45
barrel at 3:10 p.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The spread has fallen 3.8 percent
in August, the fifth month that processing profits have dropped.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade rose 5 cents
from the end of last month to $2.05 a barrel, indicating that
the profitability of making  aviation fuel  over diesel is little
changed.  Light Distillates  PetroChina bought two cargoes, each containing 50,000
barrels of 92-RON gasoline, at $127.20 a barrel, the survey of
traders showed. Shell sold one cargo, while Total SA sold the
other. Total also sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON to Arcadia
Petroleum Ltd. at $127.20 a barrel.  That compares with the $122.20 to $122.80 a barrel paid for
92-RON cargoes on Aug. 29. There was no oil trading on the
Platts window yesterday because of a public holiday in
Singapore.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
to $102.30 a ton at 6 p.m. Singapore time from $126.50 at the
end of trading in Asia on Aug. 29, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of processing profit,
was at $116.65 on July 29.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 43 cents to
$6.07 a barrel at 3:10 p.m. Singapore time, PVM said. The spread
shrank from as much as $10.65 earlier today as crude oil pared
losses in  New York  on speculation that the U.S. will take
further steps to bolster its economy. Losses from making fuel
oil have narrowed 15 percent this month.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
was at $8 a ton from $9 on July 29, PVM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
