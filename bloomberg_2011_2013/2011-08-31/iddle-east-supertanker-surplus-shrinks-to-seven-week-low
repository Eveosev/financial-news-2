An excess of supertankers available
to carry crude oil from the  Middle East , the world’s largest
cargo-loading region, shrank to the lowest level since July 12,
in a “reasonably active week”, a survey showed.  There are 14 percent more very large crude carriers for
hire over the next 30 days than there are likely cargoes,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
five shipbrokers and one owner today. The surplus dropped by 6
percentage points from last week’s 20 percent oversupply to a
seven-week low.  “A reasonably active week so far with half of the
September program covered,” Marex Spectron Pte said in an e-
mailed report today.  Daily returns on the industry’s benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-
Japan route, which vary with fuel costs, remained negative for
the third day in a row at minus $150 today, according to the
 Baltic Exchange  in London. Rental income first turned negative
on Aug. 1, according to the exchange, when rents fell to minus
$1,037 a day. Returns were as high as $16,204 a day on Jan. 4.  Charter rates fell 0.2 percent to 47.24 Worldscale points,
according to the exchange. That’s down 3.1 percent since July 29
and down 5.5 percent since Jan. 4.  Worldscale points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or
flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a metric ton, are revised
annually by the Worldscale Association in London to reflect
changing fuel costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
