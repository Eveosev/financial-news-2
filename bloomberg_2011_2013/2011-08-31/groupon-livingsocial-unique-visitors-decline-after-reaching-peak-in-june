Groupon Inc. and LivingSocial, the
leading daily-deal providers, had fewer weekly unique visitors
in August than in mid-June, at the peak, with LivingSocial’s
tally dropping at a faster pace, according to  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   Groupon, which plans an initial public offering, had 4.01
million unique visitors in the week that ended Aug. 21,
according to Reston, Virginia-based ComScore. While that’s lower
than 5.13 million for the week that ended June 12, it’s higher
than the tally for the first week of the year.  LivingSocial, which is weighing an IPO, had 1.81 million
unique visitors in the Aug. 21 period, down from 3.94 million in
mid-June, and less than 2.08 million at the beginning of the
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
