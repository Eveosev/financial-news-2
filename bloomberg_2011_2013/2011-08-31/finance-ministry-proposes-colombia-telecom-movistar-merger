Colombia’s finance minister Juan
Carlos Echeverry said he sent congress a proposal that would
allow Colombia Telecomunicaciones SA to merge with Movistar, a
unit of  Telefonica SA (TEF) ,  Spain ’s largest phone company.  The proposal would open the way for Colombia Telecom, as
the company is known, to “obtain potential synergies” in fixed
line and cellular phone services while allowing the government
to “mitigate fiscal risk,” according to a copy of the
proposal.  Telefonica SA paid $369 million and assumed debt for a
controlling stake in Colombia Telecomunicaciones in 2006. The
government owns a 49 percent stake in the company while
Telefonica owns 51 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
