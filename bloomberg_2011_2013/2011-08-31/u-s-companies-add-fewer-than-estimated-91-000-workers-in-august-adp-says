Companies in the U.S. added 91,000
workers to payrolls in August, according to a private survey.  The increase followed a revised 109,000 gain the prior
month, according to data from ADP Employer Services. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for an
advance of 100,000.  The economy needs to generate more jobs on a sustained
basis in order to bring down unemployment, which has been at 9
percent or higher in 25 of the past 27 months. A Labor
Department report in two days is projected to show businesses
added 100,000 jobs in August, down from a 154,000 increase in
July, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The labor market continues to struggle,” Sean Incremona,
a senior economist at 4Cast Inc. in  New York , said before the
report. “There is too much uncertainty that is restraining
firms from committing resources to hiring.”  The median forecast was based on a survey of 37 economists.
Projections ranged from gains of 5,000 to 140,000.  Stock-index futures held earlier gains after the report.
The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing next
month rose 1 percent to 1,216.7 at 8:36 a.m. in New York.
 Treasury securities  were little changed.  No Verizon Effect  The ADP report said its figures didn’t reflect the labor
dispute that affected roughly 45,000 workers at New York-based
Verizon Communications Inc. The workers were on strike for two
weeks before returning to their posts Aug. 22 under the terms of
their previous contract.  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figure was
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in February, when it understated the gain in jobs by
5,000. The estimate was least accurate in June, when it
overestimated the increase in employment by 100,000.  Last month, ADP’s initial figures showed a 114,000 gain in
company payrolls for July, while the Labor Department’s data
showed a 154,000 increase.  Today’s ADP report showed an increase of 11,000 workers in
goods-producing industries last month, which include
manufacturers and construction companies. Employment at
factories dropped by 4,000.  Manufacturing Cools  Orders to manufacturers, a pillar of the expansion,
contracted last month for the first time since June 2009, the
month the recession ended, according to figures from the
Institute for Supply Management  Service providers added 80,000 workers in August, the
figures showed.  Companies employing more than 499 workers added 3,000 jobs.
Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees, increased
payrolls by 30,000 and employment at small companies climbed by
58,000, ADP said.  Another report today showed employers in August announced
more job cuts than a year earlier. Planned firings climbed 47
percent from August 2010 to 51,114, according to figures
released today by Chicago-based Challenger, Gray & Christmas
Inc. Job-cut announcements were led by the government and
financial and retail industries.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , speaking at the
annual central bank symposium last week in  Jackson Hole ,
 Wyoming , said the Fed still had tools at its disposal to
stimulate the economy even as he declined to specify which
measures it might use.  Bernanke’s View  “It is clear that the recovery from the crisis has been
much less robust than we had hoped,” Bernanke said. “Economic
growth has, for the most part, been at rates insufficient to
achieve sustained reductions in unemployment.”  Job cuts have accelerated as recent data showed the economy
slowed more than previously reported in the first half of the
year.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest U.S. lender, will
eliminate about 3,500 jobs this quarter to focus “on what we
can control” amid financial-market turmoil following the first
U.S. credit downgrade in history, Chief Executive Officer  Brian
T. Moynihan  said on Aug. 19. “We owe it to our customers and
our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our
expenses carefully.”  The Labor Department figures on Sept. 2 will also show the
jobless rate held at 9.1 percent last month, according to the
Bloomberg survey median.  Total payrolls are forecast to increase by 70,000 after a
117,000 gain in July, according to the Bloomberg survey.  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
companies with more than 21 million workers on payrolls.
