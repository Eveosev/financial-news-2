OCI Co.,  South Korea â€™s biggest
polysilicon maker, fell as much as 5.2 percent in Seoul trading
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its share-price estimate to
320,000 won, citing lower average selling price forecasts. The
stock dropped to 304,000 won as of 10:08 a.m. on the Korea
Exchange. The benchmark Kospi Index was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
