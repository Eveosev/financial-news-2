Vivek Kundra, the former U.S. chief
information officer who pushed agencies to move computer systems
to the cloud, will advise the European Commission on its plan to
improve cross-border online commerce.  Neelie Kroes, vice president in charge of the commission’s
digital agenda, said today that Kundra would be advising her on
issues involving the security of cloud computing, in which
remote networks of computing resources are shared by multiple
customers.  Kroes and Kundra spoke on a panel today at the Dreamforce
2011 conference in  San Francisco . The event was hosted by
 Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , which has advocated the federal government
adopt cloud computing.  The European Commission’s digital agenda “will update EU
Single Market rules for the digital era,” the European
Commission’s Information Society website  states . “The aims are
to boost the music download business, establish a single area
for online payments, and further protect EU consumers in
cyberspace.”  Kundra, who resigned his White House position this month,
created a government wide initiative to shift up to $20 billion
in annual federal technology spending to cloud computing.
Agencies have begun to award cloud contracts to contractors
including  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  for services such as
e-mail and website management.  The European Commission will publish the digital agenda’s
strategy next year, Kroes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
