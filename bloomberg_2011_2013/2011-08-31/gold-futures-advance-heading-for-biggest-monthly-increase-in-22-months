Gold rose in  New York , capping the
biggest monthly gain since November 2009, on speculation that
the  Federal Reserve  will take more action to spur growth.  Minutes released yesterday from the Fed’s meeting earlier
this month showed some policy makers favored more aggressive
action to stimulate growth. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
rose as much as 1.3 percent to the highest in almost four weeks,
erasing its 2011 loss. Gold is up 12 percent this month after
touching an all-time high of $1,917.90 an ounce on Aug. 23.  “Equities are reasserting themselves, but in the backdrop,
traders know the Fed is going to do something to stimulate the
economy, so sell-offs in gold are being bought,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a strategist at MF Global in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery rose $1.90, or 0.1
percent, to settle at $1,831.70 at 1:56 p.m. on the Comex. The
most-active contract has risen 29 percent this year.  Earlier, the price dropped as much as 0.9 percent as
equities rallied. Gold surged in August on mounting speculation
that the U.S. economic recovery will falter and as the Federal
Reserve pledged to keep borrowing costs at a record low until
mid-2013. This month, the metal also reached records in euros
and British pounds amid  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “With stocks rallying, there’s just an excuse for
investors to take profits on gold,”  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 30.4 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $41.768 an ounce on the Comex, capping a 4.1
percent gain in August.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery climbed $3.10, or 0.2 percent, to $1,856.20 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery gained $11.15, or
1.4 percent, to $790.45 an ounce.  This month, palladium fell 4.5 percent and platinum gained
4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
