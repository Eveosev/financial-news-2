U.K. lawmakers should delay
implementing new regulations that would require banks to take on
more expensive funding at a time when they are already under
pressure, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, citing an interview with
 Andrew Tyrie , chairman of the Treasury Select Committee.  “Now is not the time to implement liquidity requirements
that are above those proposed internationally,” Tyrie said,
according to the newspaper. “The banks are themselves under
stress at the moment as a result of the tightening in market
conditions in recent months,” the Telegraph cited him as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
