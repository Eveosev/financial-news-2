Coffee production in  Costa Rica  will
rise less than 1 percent in the 2011-12 season as growers
replant trees, according to data from the Costa Rican Coffee
Institute, known as Icafe.  Output will rise to about 2.064 million quintals, or 1.58
million 60-kilogram bags, in the season starting in October, up
from 2.047 million quintals in the current season, data e-mailed
by the institute showed today.  “Producers are renovating coffee plantations,” Ronald
Peters Seevers, executive director of  Icafe , said by telephone
from  San Jose , Costa Rica. He added that it took at least two
years for the new plants to start producing.  Costa Rica aims to increase production to 2.5 million
quintals by 2015, he said. Planting new coffee trees is key to
reaching that target, he added.  Costa Rica ranked as Central America’s fourth largest
coffee producer in 2010-11, according to the  International
Coffee Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
