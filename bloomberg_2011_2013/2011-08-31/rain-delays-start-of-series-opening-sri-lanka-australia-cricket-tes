Australia  captain  Michael Clarke  won
the toss and chose to bat first against  Sri Lanka  in the series-
opening cricket Test in Galle.  The start was delayed by an hour because of overnight rain.
Fast bowler Trent Copeland and spinner Nathan Lyon will make
their debuts for Australia, which is playing its first elite
Test since January.  No. 5 Australia would move above Sri Lanka into fourth
place in the  International Cricket Council â€™s Test Championship
standings by winning the best-of-three contest.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
