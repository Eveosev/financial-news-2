Crazy Maureen Folan gets her last
chance to shine at the ball this weekend. She puts her shortest
party dress on and becomes “The Beauty Queen of Leenane.”  Derbhle Crotty has the title role in Irish writer Martin
McDonagh’s play, which is coming to the end of its  London  run.  The story starts with comedy. Maureen, 40, trades stories
and insults with her mother Mag, 70 (portrayed with dry wit by
Rosaleen Linehan). Manipulative Mag angers her virginal daughter
by trying to destroy her first and only hope of finding a man.  They battle for survival in a rural cottage under a poster
that ominously proclaims “may you be half an hour in heaven
afore the devil knows you’re dead.”  Young Vic, 66 The Cut, Waterloo, SE1 8LZ. Ends Saturday
(2:30 p.m. matinee and 7:30 p.m.) Information: +44-20-7922-2922
or  http://www.youngvic.org/ .  The Anchor & Hope, just a few steps from the Young Vic, was
this week named as London’s best pub for food by Harden’s
restaurant guide. The place is often packed so it’s essential to
arrive early if you want to eat. Information:

 Las Vegas ” will be spending the weekend in London, soberly
surveying the state of culture.  Mike Figgis is curating the “Deloitte Ignite” three-day
festival at the Royal Opera House. There are performances or
talks by artist Peter Blake, writer Neil LaBute, astrologer
 Shelley von Strunckel  and flamenco star  Eva Yerbabuena .  Deloitte LLP is sponsoring. Information:

repeatedly advising his audience at the O2’s little sister
IndigO2 as he brings his European tour to London.  The reggae star has a deep catalog of other hits to choose
from, including “The Harder They Come,” “Wild World” and the
eternally optimistic forecast “I Can See Clearly Now” -- this
year performed at Glastonbury as murky clouds poured rain.  IndigO2, Peninsula Square, SE10 0DX. Information:

 http://www.jimmycliff.com/v-css/news/   Sunday  Slavery isn’t a thing of the past. Thousands of people in
the U.K. are trafficked and forced to work for free, beg or
prostitute themselves. The Museum of London points the finger in
a small, free exhibition.  Illustrations are by  Magnum  photographer  Chris Steele-
Perkins , who conceals victims’ features. Pictured from behind is
a woman trafficked from  India  who was made to work seven days a
week, beaten and raped by a man who took her money.  A London map brings it closer to home. Traffickers were
caught trying to sell a Lithuanian woman for 3,000 pounds
($4,882) outside Selfridge’s on Oxford Street, the map shows.
Child trafficking may be happening on Eurostar trains. And the
London 2012 Olympics may make things worse, because more cheap
labor is needed.  “Freedom From: Modern Slavery in the Capital” is at
Museum of London, 150 London Wall, EC2Y 5HN. Information:
 http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk  or +44-20-7001-9844.  Barbecoa, the barbecue-meat restaurant co-owned by  Jamie Oliver  and New York chef Adam Perry Lang, is convenient for the
Museum of London. It is also suitable for families -- so long as
they’re not on a tight budget.  Information:  http://www.barbecoa.com/  or +44-20-3005-8555.  (Mark Beech and Farah Nayeri write for Muse, the arts &
