European Central Bank Executive
Board member Peter Praet said a “clear deadline” is needed for
complete migration to  Europe ’s common electronic payments
system.  “We all share the conviction that determining a clear
deadline for migration to the SEPA credit transfer and the SEPA
direct debit is necessary to bring SEPA to a successful
conclusion,” Praet said at a meeting of the European Payments
Council in Brussels today, according to a speech published by
the ECB.  SEPA enables customers to make euro transfers across
borders within Europe using a single payment account and a
single set of payment instruments. Thirty-two European countries
are participating in SEPA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
