Estonia’s central bank said there
are four candidates to replace Governor  Andres Lipstok  when his
term expires next year.  The bank’s eight-member supervisory board will meet Sept. 6
to discuss the candidacies of Ardo Hansson, the  World Bank ’s
chief economist for  China ; Andres Sutt, a senior adviser at the
International Monetary Fund and Andres Tupits, a senior
associate with the Sorainen legal office in Tallinn, the central
bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Finance Minister
Juergen Ligi confirmed his participation in an e-mail yesterday.  The board will decide which of the candidates will be asked
to formally apply for the job and pass a security police
screening, the bank said. A successor to Lipstok must be backed
by five board members and approved by President Toomas Ilves.  Lipstok, whose seven-year term ends June 6, 2012, became a
voting member of the European Central Bank council when Estonia
adopted the euro on Jan. 1. He can’t be re-elected.  To contact the reporters on this story:
