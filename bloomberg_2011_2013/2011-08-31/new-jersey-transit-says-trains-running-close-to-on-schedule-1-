New Jersey Transit  said trains
leaving  New York ’s  Penn Station  are now running on or close to
schedule after a wire problem caused “significant” delays on
three routes.  At about 6 p.m. local time, the railroad said the Northeast
Corridor, New Jersey Coast Line and Midtown Direct lines were
delayed because wires were down at its Sunnyside Yard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
