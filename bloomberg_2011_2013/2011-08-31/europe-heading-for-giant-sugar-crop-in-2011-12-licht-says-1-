Europe  is heading for a “giant
sugar crop,” with production rising in the European Union,
Ukraine and almost doubling in Russia, according to F.O. Licht
GmbH.  Europe’s crop for the season starting Oct. 1 will be 30
million metric tons, the highest since 2005-06, the Ratzeburg,
Germany-based researcher, said in a report e-mailed today. The
large crop comes after sugar production fell to the lowest level
in more than three decades in the current crop year, F.O. Licht
said.  “Europe seems headed for a giant sugar crop in 2011-12,”
F.O. Licht wrote in the report. “The continent will therefore
cut its net sugar imports sharply in the upcoming season.”  Output in EU countries will likely rise by 2.4 million tons
to 17.4 million tons, Licht said.  France , the biggest EU sugar
beet producer, will produce 4.6 million tons, up from 3.99
million tons, it said.  Germany ’s crop will climb to 4.18 million
tons from 3.39 million, it said.  The projected production increase may not help ease
tightness in the continent, Licht said. A shortage of the
sweetener in the EU has led the bloc to allow 500,000 tons of
sugar imports at zero duty this year and the sale of another
500,000 tons of out-of-quota sugar in the domestic market.  “The rise in EU output will be exclusively in the balance
of out-of-quota sugar that must not be sold to food and beverage
producers,” Licht said in the report.  Under EU rules, local producers can supply a limited amount
of sugar to the domestic market, and any surplus must be
exported or put to non-food use.  Russia , Ukraine  Sugar production in Russia will almost double to 5.76
million tons for the crop started Aug. 1, Licht estimated. That
compares with 2.96 million tons a year earlier. Russia is likely
to “drastically” cut its raw sugar imports, Licht said.  “As Russia imports the bulk of its raw cane sugar needs
from  Brazil  and has traditionally been the South American
country’s top customer this will help largely to offset the
reduced export availability of Brazilian sugar this season,”
the researcher said in the report.  The sugar cane crop in Brazil’s Center South, the world’s
largest producing region, will fall for the first time in 10
years to 510.2 million tons, data from industry group Unica
showed.  Ukraine’s sugar output will be 2.7 million tons compared
with 1.68 million tons, according to Licht’s estimates. Both
Ukraine and Russia may re-enter the export market during the
2011-12 season, according to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
