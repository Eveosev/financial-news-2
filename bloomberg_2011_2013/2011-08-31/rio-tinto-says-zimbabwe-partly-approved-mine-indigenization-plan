Rio Tinto  Group said it received
partial approval from the Zimbabwean government for its plan to
increase ownership of the Murowa diamond mine by black citizens
of the country.  “The company continues to constructively engage with
government on other elements with a view to finalizing its full
indigenization plan with the aim of ensuring a successful and
sustainable transaction,” London-based Rio Tinto, the world’s
second-largest mining company, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Zimbabwe gave foreign companies until June 2 to submit
plans to cede 51 percent of their assets to local citizens. Rio
said its plan was presented on May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
