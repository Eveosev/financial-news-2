German bunds fell as stocks gained
and U.S. economic reports surpassed economists’ forecasts,
reducing demand for the perceived safety of government debt.  Bunds also pared a second monthly advance after German
unemployment dropped for a 26th month in August and some Federal
Reserve officials said they favored taking steps to boost the
 U.S. economy . Irish and Portuguese securities rose as German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet approved proposed changes to
the European Financial Stability Facility, which will allow it
to buy bonds.  Spain  and France plan to sell debt tomorrow.  “Fixed-income markets are taking direction from the equity
markets, where there is risk-on sentiment,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in  London .
“Risk markets are taking some comfort in the fact that the Fed
discussed measures to support the economy. Stocks are up, and so
bunds are falling.”  Two-year German yields climbed seven basis points to 0.73
percent as of 4:32 p.m. in London. They dropped to 0.54 percent
on Aug. 18, the least since June 30, 2010. The 0.75 percent
security due in September 2013 declined 0.14, or 1.40 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,443) face amount, to 100.045.  The 10-year yield was seven basis points higher at 2.22
percent, after falling to a record low 2.03 percent on Aug. 18.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained for a third day,
advancing 2.9 percent, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose
1.2 percent.  Fed Minutes  A few members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  favored
a “more substantial move” beyond the pledge adopted to hold
borrowing costs at record lows for the next two years, according
to minutes of the Fed’s Aug. 9 meeting released yesterday.
Stocks extended gains today after U.S. reports showed growth in
factory orders that exceeded projections, and business activity
expanded at a faster pace than forecast.  “Equities are pushing to the upside after the Fed minutes
and so core fixed income is suffering,” said Eric Wand, a bond
strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London.  The number of people out of work in Germany fell a
seasonally adjusted 8,000 to 2.95 million, the Federal Labor
Agency said in Nuremburg. Economists forecast a drop of 10,000,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  German debt still headed for a second monthly gain. Ten-
year yields dropped 32 basis points in August as signs the U.S.
economic recovery is losing momentum and concern the euro-region
debt crisis is intensifying sparked demand for assets perceived
to be havens.  Irish Bonds  Irish two-year yields fell to the lowest in six months
after German ministers meeting in Berlin backed a reworked
European Financial Stability Facility including sovereign bond-
buying powers which will push up  Germany ’s share of EFSF loan
guarantees to 211 billion euros from 123 billion euros.  The measures were agreed on by European leaders at a July
21 summit in a bid to stop a region-wide selloff in bonds after
the debt crisis that engulfed Greece, Ireland and  Portugal 
threatened to spread to Spain and  Italy .  Ireland’s two-year yields fell 35 basis points to 7.60
percent after earlier sliding to 7.58 percent, the least since
Feb. 24. Portugal’s two-year yields dropped 35 basis points to
12.04 percent.  Ireland’s 10-year rates have declined 2.28 percentage
points this month, while Portugal’s 10-year yields have dropped
47 basis points as investors bet the two nations will be next in
line to benefit from lower financing costs.  ‘Favorable Financing’  “The German approval of the expanded EFSF is positive for
Portugal and Ireland,” said Norbert Aul, a European interest-
rates strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “It makes it
more likely that they will get more favorable financing terms
once the second bail out for  Greece  is approved.”  Portugal’s bonds stayed higher as the government said it
expects the economy to expand 1.2 percent in 2013, after
shrinking 2.2 percent in 2011 and 1.8 percent in 2012.  Greek bonds declined after  Finland ’s Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  said his nation isn’t willing to abandon its goal of
securing collateral in exchange for its commitment to a second
Greek bailout package.  Ten-year Greek yields climbed nine basis points to 17.81
percent. They have surged 2.98 percentage points this month amid
speculation other nations will ask for collateral deals in
return for providing fresh assistance and that this will
jeopardize the aid package.  Spain plans to sell up to 4 billion euros of bonds maturing
in 2016 tomorrow, while  France  will auction bonds maturing in
2016, 2021 and 2041.  German  government bonds  have returned 5.7 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
have gained 7.5 percent. Irish bonds have returned 7.7 percent,
while Portugal’s have lost 16 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
