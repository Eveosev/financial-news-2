The  Economic and Social Research
Institute  downgraded its 2011 growth forecast for the Irish
economy to 1.8 percent from 2 percent and advises the government
to trim its deficit quicker than planned, the Irish Times
reported, citing the Instituteâ€™s Quarterly Economic Bulletin.  The Dublin, Ireland-based think tank predicted public debt
would reach 109 percent of gross domestic product, in 2012 down
from its previous estimate of 116 percent of GDP three months
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
