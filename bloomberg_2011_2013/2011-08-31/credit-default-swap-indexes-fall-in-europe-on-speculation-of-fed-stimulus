The cost of insuring against default
on sovereign and corporate debt fell on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will stimulate growth in the world’s largest economy.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 40 European companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings
dropped 41 basis points to 640, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co. at 3 p.m. in London. The Markit CDX North America Investment
Grade Index decreased 4.5 basis points to 133.5.  A third round of asset purchases, known as quantitative
easing, may be on the cards after minutes of the  Federal Open
Market Committee ’s Aug. 9 meeting showed support for more
action. Swaps are also rallying as investors cover so-called
short positions that were put on amid signs the economic
recovery is slowing.  The Fed’s minutes “gave solid evidence that further
accommodation is not a question of if but a question of how and
when it will take place,” said Greg Venizelos, a strategist at
BNP Paribas SA in London. “QE3, should, at a minimum, help
restore risk appetite and alleviate some of the ills that have
been hurting risky assets in the past few weeks.”  Fed officials this month discussed a range of tools,
including buying more  government bonds  and lengthening the
average maturity in its portfolio, without coming to an
agreement on what they might do should the economy weaken
further. They will more fully debate their options when they
gather next month for a two-day meeting that was originally
scheduled to last one day.  Europe Index  The gauge of U.S. company credit risk fell for a third day,
contributing to the biggest three-day decline in 15 months. The
benchmark is down from a 14-month high of 127 on Aug. 22.  Europe’s high-yield benchmark is up from 438 basis points
July 29, heading for the biggest monthly increase since Oct.
2008, JPMorgan prices show. It reached 721 basis points Aug. 24,
the highest since July 2009.  The Markit iTraxx  Europe  Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 10 basis points today to 151.5
basis points, after reaching 172.5 basis points on Aug. 24.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased 16 basis points to 224, after
earlier being on track for a record monthly increase, and the
subordinated index dropped 27 to 415.  The cost of insuring government debt fell to the lowest in
two weeks as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet ratified
an expansion of the European Financial Stability Facility to
help combat the euro-area debt crisis.  Sovereign Swaps  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments declined 11 basis points to 289. Contracts on  Greece 
dropped 55 basis points to 2,200,  Portugal  declined 39 basis
points to 918 and Ireland was 32 basis points lower at 772,
according to CMA.  Spain  fell 9 basis points to 361 and Italy was down 6 at
365, while  France  dropped 7 to 154 and  Germany  declined 5 to 76.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
