Mike Kirkup,  Research In Motion
Ltd. (RIM) ’s senior director of global developer relations, announced
his resignation today on his personal blog.  “The mobile space continues to change so quickly and this
seems like a great time to step back and consider my next
steps,” Kirkup said on  the blog .  RIM, which makes the BlackBerry line of smartphones, has
trailed Apple Inc. and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  in attracting software
developers to its technology. The company is planning to sell
models that can run Google Android applications, people familiar
with the plan said this month. As of July, there were more than
250,000 apps available from Google’s Android Market, or about
six times as many as in RIM’s App World.  Marisa Conway, a spokeswoman for Waterloo, Ontario-based
RIM, didn’t immediately return a request for comment after
business hours.  RIM shares have fallen 44 percent this year. The stock rose
$1.82 to $32.55 today on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  RIM’s share of the global smartphone-software market
dropped to 12 percent in the second quarter from 19 percent a
year earlier, according to Gartner Inc. Over the same period,
Android rose to 43 percent of the market. Apple, which makes the
iPhone, climbed to 18 percent from 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
