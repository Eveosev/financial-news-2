Taiwan’s bonds surged this month,
pushing five-year yields down the most since 2009, while the
local currency fell as signs the U.S. recovery is losing steam
dimmed the outlook for exports and deterred risk-taking.  The Taiex index of shares lost 10.4 percent this month, the
biggest loss since October 2008, and the  Taiwan dollar  weakened
the most since February. Global funds sold $6.6 billion more of
the island’s shares than they bought since July, bringing net
sales for 2011 to $7.7 billion, exchange data show.  “The worrying data coming out from the U.S. supported
bonds today,” said Artie Yao, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “The drop in yields this month
reflects traders are less and less expecting a rate hike.”  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016 fell 19
basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, this month to 1.016
percent as of the 1:30 p.m. local close, prices from Gretai
Securities Market show. That was the biggest decline for a
benchmark five-year note since January 2009.  Taiwan’s dollar traded at NT$29.020 versus the greenback,
0.4 percent weaker than at the end of July and little changed
today, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed this month and today at
0.394 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  The government cut its 2011 economic growth forecast this
month to 4.81 percent from 5.01 percent, after reporting second-
quarter expansion of 5.02 percent that was the slowest since
2009. The central bank last boosted its benchmark  interest rate 
on June 30 by 12.5 basis points to 1.875 percent. The policy
board is set to meet again in late September.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
