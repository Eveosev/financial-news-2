Orco Property Group SA, a developer
with most of its assets in eastern  Europe , posted a first-half
loss after revenue declined by more than half. The company said
it could face “challenging” refinancing problems in bond
repayments.  The net loss for six months ended June 30 was 7.5 million
euros ($7.4 million) compared with a pro-forma profit of 237.5
million euros in the year-ago period, the Luxembourg-based
developer said in a statement. Revenue fell to 73.57 million
euros from 153.8 million euros.  "The financial environment remains challenging and may have
an adverse impact on our financing and refinancing
alternatives,’’ Chief Executive Officer Jean-Francois Ott said
in a statement posted today on their website.  Orco received a court approval in May last year to postpone
repayment of claims to creditors over a 10-year period. The
company has been selling non-performing assets, trimming costs
and focusing on development in capital cities like Prague,
Berlin or Warsaw to overhaul the business.  Orco said today it agreed to sell its Russian assets for 53
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
