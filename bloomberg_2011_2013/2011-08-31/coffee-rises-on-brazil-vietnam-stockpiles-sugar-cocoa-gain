Coffee futures rose to the highest
in more than three months in  New York  on signs of limited global
supplies. Sugar and cocoa also climbed.  World coffee exports fell to 7.35 million bags in July from
8.2 million bags a year earlier, the  International Coffee
Organization  said today. Vietnam, the world’s largest grower of
the robusta variety, cut its 2011 export forecast to 1.17
million metric tons from 1.2 million tons, the agriculture
ministry said in a monthly report on its website.  “Coffee continues to move higher on tight supplies,”  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision Financial Markets in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview.  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 1.55 cents, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $2.8825 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York, after touching $2.885, the highest since May 10.
Prices jumped 20 percent in August, the biggest monthly gain
since June 2010.  The harvests under way in  Brazil , the top arabica grower,
and Vietnam will help rebuild stockpiles, easing pressure on
prices, Cruel said.  Favorable weather in coffee-producing regions of Brazil
will help completion of the harvest and drying of beans,
forecaster Somar Meteorologia said yesterday. Buyers are
demanding a discount for Vietnam’s coffee crop on speculation of
record output, according to three people involved in the trade.  Arabica beans are grown mainly in  Latin America  and brewed
by specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta, used
in instant coffee, is harvested mostly in Asia and parts of
Africa. A bag weighs 132 pounds or 60 kilograms.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery advanced 0.06 cent,
or 0.2 percent, to settle at 29.68 cents a pound in New York.  Cocoa for December delivery climbed $11, or 0.4 percent, to
$3,113 a metric ton on ICE.  On NYSE Liffe in  London , robusta coffee and refined sugar
fell, while cocoa increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
