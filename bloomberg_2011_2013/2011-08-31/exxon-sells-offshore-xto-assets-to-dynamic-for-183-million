Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s
largest oil company, sold offshore crude wells and other assets
from its XTO Energy unit for $182.5 million to Dynamic Offshore
Resources LLC.  The XTO assets, located in the Gulf of Mexico, will add the
equivalent of 13.5 million barrels of crude to Dynamic’s
reserves, the equivalent of a 31 percent increase, Houston-based
Dynamic said in an e-mailed statement today. Dynamic, a closely
held oil explorer backed by Riverstone Holdings LLC, filed a
prospectus last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for an initial share sale.  The properties produce the equivalent of 7,000 barrels of
oil a day, Dynamic said. The reserves are comprised of 40
percent oil and the rest is natural gas, according to the
statement.  Exxon, based in Irving,  Texas , has said it’s selling lower
profit assets acquired in last year’s $34.9 billion acquisition
of XTO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
