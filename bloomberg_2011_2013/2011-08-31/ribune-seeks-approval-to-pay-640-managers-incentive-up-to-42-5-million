Tribune Co., the owner of the Los
Angeles Times and the  Chicago Tribune , sought approval from a
bankruptcy judge to pay as much as $42.5 million to 640 managers
as part of an incentive plan.  The 2011 plan would pay managers $16.4 million if Tribune
reaches the “threshold” performance of 91 percent of its
planned consolidated operating cash flow, Tribune said in a
filing today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Wilmington, Delaware.
The payout is $32.4 million with a “target” performance of 109
percent of planned cash flow and $42.5 million if 141 percent is
reached.  Approval of the plan, which is similar to plans approved in
previous years, is “critically important” to maintain
incentives for the management team, according to the filing by
the Chicago-based company.  The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
