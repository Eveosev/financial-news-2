Chinese consumer lending will
probably triple in five years, driven by rising personal
incomes, the  Boston Consulting Group Inc.  said.  The balance of consumer lending, including home mortgages,
credit cards, automobile loans and unsecured personal loans, may
rise to 21 trillion yuan ($3.3 trillion) in 2015 from 7 trillion
yuan in 2010, the Boston-based consulting company said in a
report released today.  Chinese regulators told banks to tighten lending to
property developers on concern credit risks will rise as the
effect of government curbs deepens in the next three to five
months, a person familiar with the matter said earlier this
month. Mortgages, which accounted for 84 percent of consumer
lending, will will probably increase to 15.5 trillion yuan in
2015 from 6 trillion yuan in 2010, according to the report.  “The foundation of consumer lending is economic and
personal-income growth, and  China  has been strong on both counts
of late,” the report said.  The report’s estimates are based on a survey of 1,600
Chinese residents in 15 cities.  --Michael Wei, Editors: Dave McCombs, Frank Longid  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
