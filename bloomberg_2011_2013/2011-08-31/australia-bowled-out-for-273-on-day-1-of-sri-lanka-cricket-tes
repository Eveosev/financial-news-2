Australia was bowled out for 273 on
the opening day of the series-opening cricket Test against  Sri
Lanka  in Galle.  Michael Hussey  scored 95 for the visitors, who elected to
bat after winning the toss. Suranga Lakmal and Rangana Herath
claimed three wickets each.  Play was delayed at the start after overnight rain and bad
light brought stumps before Sri Lanka could bat.  No. 5 Australia would move above Sri Lanka into fourth
place in the International Cricket Councilâ€™s Test Championship
standings by winning the best-of-three contest.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
