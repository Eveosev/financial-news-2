French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
office denied today a report, to be published in a book, that he
received cash from  L’Oreal SA (OR)  heiress Liliane Bettencourt.  Le Monde journalists Gerard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme cited
Judge Isabelle Prevost-Desprez, charged with investigating
allegations of the 88-year-old heiress’s “frailty,” as saying
that a Bettencourt employee told her she witnessed the payment.  Prevost-Desprez’s allegations will feature in the
journalists’ book entitled ”Sarko m’a tuer,” or “Sarko Killed
Me,” to be published this week in France. Excerpts were
published in Liberation newspaper today.  A spokesman for Sarkozy who declined to be named denied the
judge’s claim, calling them unfounded and scandalous.  To contact the reporter on this story:
