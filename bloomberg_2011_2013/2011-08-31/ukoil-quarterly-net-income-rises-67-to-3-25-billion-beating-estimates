OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, said profit rose 67 percent in the second quarter
after crude prices climbed, outweighing a decline in output. The
shares headed for a four-week high.  Net income climbed to $3.25 billion from $1.95 billion, the
Moscow-based company said in a statement today. That beat an
average estimate of $3.05 billion from six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Sales rose 35 percent to $34.9 billion in the
period, Lukoil said.  Lukoil is seeking to expand internationally as the western
Siberian fields that traditionally provide over half of its
production age and the northern Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu deposit
developed with ConocoPhillips yields less crude than expected.
Russia, seeking to keep output stable, may lower taxes on oil
exporters from Oct. 1 after Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  signed
off on the first step of  tax reform  last week.  “The production decline and a minimal increase in spending
may indicate the company is waiting for tax sector reform before
ratcheting up investments,” Pavel Sorokin, an oil and gas
analyst at  Alfa Bank , said by telephone today.  Capital expenditures increased 14 percent to $3.57 billion
in the first half of the year, Lukoil said in the statement.  The shares advanced 1 percent to 1,744 rubles by 2:20 p.m.
in Moscow, poised for their best close since Aug. 3.  Exports Decline  Total production fell 4.7 percent to 2.14 million barrels
of oil equivalent a day. Oil output declined about 5.5 percent
to 1.84 million barrels a day. Gas-available-for-sale output
rose 0.3 percent to 4.53 billion cubic meters, the company said.  Urals crude, Russia’s main export blend of oil, climbed 48
percent in the second quarter, averaging $113.73 a barrel in
northwestern  Europe , the Moscow-based company said.  Lukoil’s exports dropped 15 percent to 62.1 million barrels
in the second quarter as domestic refining rose and output fell.  Lukoil has set aside $1.78 billion to buy an undisclosed
producing asset, it said. The company initially reported the
cash reserve in the first quarter and has yet to reveal the
asset it may buy.  OAO Rosneft is Russia’s largest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
