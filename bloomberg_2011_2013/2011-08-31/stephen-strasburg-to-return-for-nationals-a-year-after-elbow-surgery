Stephen Strasburg , the No. 1 pick in
the 2009 Major League Baseball draft, will pitch his first game
in a year Sept. 6 for the  Washington Nationals  after recovering
from elbow surgery.  Strasburg, 23, has been pitching rehabilitation games for
the Nationals’ minor-league teams since Aug. 7. He’ll make his
final minor-league start tomorrow for Double-A Harrisburg, where
he’s scheduled to throw 75-80 pitches, or six innings.  “If everything is fine, he will stay in the rotation,”
manager Davey Johnson said on the Nationals’ website last night.  Strasburg, who signed a record $15 million, four-year
contract, had so-called Tommy John surgery to replace a torn
ligament on Sept. 4, 2010, two weeks after he injured his
pitching arm during a win over the  Philadelphia Phillies .  Strasburg may pitch a maximum of five innings against the
 Los Angeles Dodgers  at Nationals Park in Washington in his
return, Johnson said.  Strasburg set a major league record with 41 strikeouts in
his first four starts last season and went 5-3 with a 2.92
earned run average and 92 strikeouts in 68 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
