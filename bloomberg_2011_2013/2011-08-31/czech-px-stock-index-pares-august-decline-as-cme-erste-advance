The Czech Republic’s benchmark stock
index rose, paring its monthly retreat, as speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve may add to economic stimulus.  The PX gauge of 14 companies added 0.7 percent to 1,037.2
by 10:01 a.m. in  Prague , heading for its highest close since
Aug. 5. The index was still 12 percent down since the end of
July, heading for its biggest monthly slump since February 2009.  European shares gained for a third day after Fed minutes
showed some policy makers wanted to take more measures to
support growth in the world’s largest economy, boosting demand
for riskier assets.  In Prague,  Austria ’s  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  rose 1.4 percent
to 602 koruna, paring monthly losses to 25 percent.  Central
European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)  climbed 3.8 percent to 219
koruna, reducing its August decline to 31 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
