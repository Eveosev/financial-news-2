Estonian industrial production
growth slowed in July as exports of electronics decelerated,
showing the European Union’s fastest-growing economy is cooling.  Production rose 22.9 percent from a year earlier, the
slowest pace in 11 months, the Tallinn-based statistics office
said today on its website. That compares with a 23.8 percent
increase in June. Output was up 4.7 percent from the previous
month on a seasonally adjusted basis.  Estonia’s $19 billion economy may “be on a less stable
footing” due to rising global  risk aversion , the central bank
said on Aug. 11, while it maintained its full-year growth
forecast of 6.3 percent.  The pace of exports will slow in the second half due to
stronger comparison figures from a year earlier, Annika Paabut,
Swedbank’s chief economist in Tallinn, told a news conference
last week.  The Baltic nation’s economy has expanded at the fastest
pace in the 27-member EU in the first half, growing a
preliminary 8.4 percent from a year earlier in the second
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
