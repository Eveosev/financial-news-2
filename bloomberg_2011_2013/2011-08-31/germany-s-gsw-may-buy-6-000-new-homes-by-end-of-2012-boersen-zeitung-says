GSW Immobilien AG, the German real-
estate company that first sold shares to the public in April,
may buy as many as 6,000 new homes by the end of next year,
 Boersen-Zeitung  reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Thomas Zinnoecker.  The Berlin-based residential landlord could spend as much
as 400 million euros ($578 million) on acquisitions, including
115 million euros of gross proceeds raised in the initial public
offering, Zinnoecker told the German newspaper in an interview.
Yesterday, GSW said first-half profit rose more than sixfold,
boosted by the sale of a cable business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
