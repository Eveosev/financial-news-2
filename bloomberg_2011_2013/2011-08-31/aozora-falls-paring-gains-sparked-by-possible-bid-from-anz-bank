Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304)  headed for its
biggest drop in more than five months in Tokyo, paring two days
of gains spurred by  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) ’s
interest in bidding for the Japanese lender.  Tokyo-based Aozora dropped 7.1 percent, the most since
March 15, to 196 yen at the 11 a.m. trading break. The lender
had risen 14 percent over the previous two days.  An assessment by ANZ Bank, Australia’s third-largest lender
by market value, of Aozora is in the early stages and there’s no
guarantee a deal will proceed, a person familiar with the matter
said yesterday, asking not to be identified because the plans
haven’t been made public. Buying Aozora may ease ANZ Bank’s
reliance on overseas debt markets for funds.  “There are no further rumors out there on Aozora, so the
drop may just be a reversal after the two days of huge gains,”
Yoku Ihara, an analyst at Retela Crea Securities Co. in  Tokyo ,
said by telephone.  Melbourne-based ANZ Bank’s interest in Aozora was reported
by the Australian Financial Review newspaper Aug. 29. The bank
has about 3 trillion yen ($39 billion) in deposits, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It has 20 branches and a market
value of about 348 billion yen.  Mike Smith , ANZ Bank’s chief executive officer, aims to
double profit generated from  Asia  in the next seven years. The
lender’s shares dropped 0.2 percent to A$20.14 in Sydney. The
stock has slid 14 percent this year, while Aozora has gained 26
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
