Shanda Interactive Entertainment
Ltd., owner of  China ’s third-biggest provider of online games,
fell the most in three weeks after its second-quarter profit
fell short of analysts’ forecasts.  Shanda’s American depositary receipts dropped 5.8 percent
to $33.84 at 10:24 a.m. New York time, after earlier plunging as
much as 7.3 percent, the most since Aug. 10.  Net income for the three months ended June 30 sank 73
percent to 63.6 million yuan ($9.9 million), or 1.1 yuan per
ADR, it said in a statement late yesterday. That was below the
2.1 yuan per ADR average estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
