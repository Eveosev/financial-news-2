Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406) , Japan’s fourth-
largest steelmaker, said it’s in talks with  Cliffs Natural
Resources Inc. (CLF)  to build a $200 million plant in the U.S.  The factory, to be located either in Michigan or elsewhere
in the U.S., is under consideration and details haven’t been
decided, Hiroyuki Hashimoto, a spokesman for the Kobe, Japan-
based company said today in a telephone interview.  Kobe Steel is seeking to expand the use of its ITmk3
technology for a plant to produce iron nuggets from low-grade
 iron ore , as rising raw materials costs squeeze steelmakers’
margins. Iron nuggets provide feedstock for electric arc
furnaces that usually use scrap steel.  The plan was reported earlier today by the Nikkei
newspaper. Kobe Steel and Cliffs Natural Resources will seek to
open a low-cost mill in  Michigan  in 2014, the report said
without saying where it obtained the information. Michigan is
one of the locations being considered, Hashimoto said.  Cliff’s,  North America ’s largest ion-ore producer, is based
in Cleveland.  It typically costs about $200 million to build a nugget
plant with capacity of 500,000 tons a year, Hashimoto said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
