New York University economist
Nouriel Roubini doesn’t expect the austerity plan passed by the
government to enable Italy to meet the goal of a balanced budget
in 2013, la Repubblica reported, citing written comments.  “Italy has to raise its growth potential through
structural reforms to correct the public finances and it thus
needs political stability and strong consensus,” the Rome-based
newspaper cited Roubini as saying. The country needs annual
growth of 1.2 percent, a primary surplus of 4.5 percent of its
gross domestic product and borrowing costs below 7 percent, he
said, according to Repubblica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
