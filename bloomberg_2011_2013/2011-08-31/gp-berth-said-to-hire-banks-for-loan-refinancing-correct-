MGP Berth Pte Ltd., a unit of
Macquarie Global Property Advisors Ltd., hired banks to help it
refinance a loan used for  Asia Square Tower 1 , an office
building in Singaporeâ€™s expanded central business district,
according to three people familiar with the matter.  The S$1.94 billion ($1.6 billion) facility will mature in
four years and banks leading the transaction include DBS Group
Holdings Ltd., Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.,  Malayan Banking
Bhd. (MAY) , Standard Chartered Plc and  United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB) , one
of the people said, asking not to be identified as details are
private.  Proceeds will refinance a loan of a similar amount which
was signed in June 2008, the people said. That facility matures
in April 2012 and pays a margin of 218 basis points more than
Singapore benchmark rates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Other lenders will be invited to participate in the new
facility and a wider banking group should be in place by the end
of September, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
