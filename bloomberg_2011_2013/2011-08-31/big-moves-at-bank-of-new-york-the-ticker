Oh, the palace intrigue. Just once wouldn't it be nice if a big, publicly held company told you what really is going on behind the curtain when it changes top management? The  big news  from Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. late this afternoon is that Robert P. Kelly has resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of the company, which is part of the too-big-to-fail club with about $305 billion of assets. Kelly, 57, also is relinquishing his seat on the company's board. His successor as chairman and CEO is Bank of New York's president, Gerald L. Hassell, 59, who already was a company director. Hassell will continue to serve as president, giving him a total of four job titles. Bank of New York said Kelly stepped down "by mutual agreement with the board of directors, due to differences in approach to managing the company." It didn't say what those differences were. Stay tuned for assorted "people familiar with the matter" to squawk anonymously to the press with their versions of what happened. At least the company didn't go with the all-too-familiar "personal reasons" to explain Kelly's resignation. (Jonathan Weil is a Bloomberg View columnist)
