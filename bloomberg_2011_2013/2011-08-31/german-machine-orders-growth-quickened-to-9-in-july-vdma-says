Growth in German plant and machinery
orders accelerated in July, driven by domestic demand, the VDMA
machine makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, rose 9 percent from a year
earlier after increasing an annual 1 percent in June, the
Frankfurt-based VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today.
Domestic orders surged 20 percent, while export orders gained 3
percent. In the three months through July, orders climbed 10
percent from the year-earlier period.  “A slight decline in orders from euro-area partners
weighed on exports,” VDMA chief economist Ralph Wiechers said
in the statement. Overall, the figures confirm that “the period
of roaring growth is coming to an end,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
