Kazakhstan said law-enforcement
officials broke up a “terror group” in the town of Atyrau in
the Central Asian nation’s biggest oil-producing region.  The authorities detained 18 suspects and killed one for
resisting arrest on Aug. 29, the Atyrau-based prosecutor’s
office said on its  website  today. Investigators are probing
reports of “violent acts” planned by the group, according to
the statement.  Kazakhstan, a predominantly Muslim former Soviet republic
that borders Russia and  China , has seen an upsurge in attacks in
its oil-rich regions. TengizChevroil LLP, the Kazakh oil venture
led by  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and the nation’s biggest oil exporter,
produces crude in the Atyrau region near the  Caspian Sea .  Ten Muslim militants in the Aktobe region were shot dead
after killing a member of a police special-forces unit, the
Vremya newspaper  reported  July 14. Three policemen were killed
in a separate July attack in the region, the newspaper said.  A suicide bombing opposite a building that houses the
National Security Committee’s local branch in the town of Aktobe
caused several casualties on May 17, according to Interfax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
