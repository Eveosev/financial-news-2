A 14-year-old Bahraini was killed
today during a crackdown on an anti-government demonstration in
Sitra, the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights said.  Ali Jawad Ahmad was participating in the rally when he was
shot directly with a tear-gas canister by Bahraini security
forces who used “excessive force” against the protesters, the
group said in an e-mailed statement.  Bahrain was rocked by demonstrations in February and March
led by mostly Shiite pro-democracy protesters. A commission of
international experts is looking into allegations of abuse
during the crackdown that followed. Ahmad’s death brings to 36
the number of people killed in the violence.  Shiite villages have held rallies almost nightly since the
Muslim fasting month of Ramadan began on Aug. 1. Riot police
have responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
