OAO Lukoil climbed for the third day
in the past four after Russiaâ€™s second-largest oil producer said
profit increased 67 percent in the second quarter as crude
prices climbed, outweighing a decline in output.  The shares added 0.6 percent to 1,737.7 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow.  Net income rose to $3.25 billion from $1.95 billion, the
Moscow-based company said in a statement today. That beat an
average estimate of $2.95 billion for adjusted net income from
12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
