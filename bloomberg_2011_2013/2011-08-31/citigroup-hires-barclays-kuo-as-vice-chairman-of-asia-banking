Citigroup Inc. (C)  hired Gary Kuo from
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  to be vice chairman of Asia global banking, the
company said today in a press release.  Kuo, will report to Farhan Faruqui, regional head of global
banking, according to the statement. He will be based in Taipei.  He will join Citigroup after spending less than a year at
Barclays as co-head of investment banking for Greater China.
Prior to that he spent almost a decade at Morgan Stanley where
he was named chairman of investment banking for Taiwan in 2006,
the release said.  Citigroup is expanding its Asia investment banking business
and hired more than 20 directors this year across the region,
 Hong Kong  spokesman James Griffiths said this week. The bank
advised Ruentex Group’s $2.16 billion purchase of American
International Group Inc.’s Taiwan unit in January this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
