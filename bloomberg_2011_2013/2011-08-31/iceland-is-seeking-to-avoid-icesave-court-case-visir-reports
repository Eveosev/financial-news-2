Iceland will meet representatives of
the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority in an
effort to prevent the island being taken to court over
depositors’ guarantees,  Visir  reported, citing Economy Minister
Arni Pall Arnason.  There are “material reasons” to wait and see what comes
out the estate of Landsbanki Islands hf before proceeding,
Arnason told Reykjavik-based Visir.  About 350,000 U.K. and Dutch depositors of Landsbanki’s
high-yielding Icesave accounts risked losing their savings when
the lender collapsed with the rest of the island’s financial
industry in October 2008. U.K. and Dutch depositors were
compensated by their own governments after the failure. A
government agreement on Iceland’s repayment terms for the $5.3
billion repaid to depositors was rejected by voters in an April
9 referendum, prompting  ESA  to continue infringement
proceedings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
