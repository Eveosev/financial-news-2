Coffee may fall in New York and
 London  on concerns high prices will dent demand as large crops
are expected in Central America and  Vietnam . Cocoa rose.  Countries in Central America will produce 13.4 million 60-
kilogram (132.3 pound) bags of coffee in the 2011-12 season,
according to data on the website of the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture , the highest since the 1999-2000 crop. Vietnam, the
largest grower of the robusta variety, will produce a record 22
million bags, Rabobank International estimates.  “Coffee is down on concerns the price has moved too high,
too fast and commercial interest could be tailing off given high
levels,” Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank International in
London, wrote in an e-mail today.  Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 0.80 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.859 a pound by 8:20 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . Robusta coffee for November delivery slid $29, or 1.2
percent, to $2,323 a metric ton NYSE Liffe in London, erasing
earlier gains of as much as 0.8 percent.  Brazilian producers may start to sell as the price of
coffee in the Sao Paulo futures exchange, or BM&F, is below the
New York value, Flury said. “With NY outpacing BM&F there are
likely concerns that Brazilian farmers may sell.”  Robusta futures prices are being capped by “better
prospects” in 2012, Lysu Paez, an analyst at Natixis SA in
Paris wrote in an e-mail today. She correctly forecast earlier
this month that robusta coffee would climb above $2,300 a ton.  Vietnamese Premiums  Expectations of a larger crop next season have resulted in
buyers demanding a discount for Vietnamese beans, according to
three people involved in the trade.  The beans are trading at $70 to $90 a ton below the price
on NYSE Liffe, according to the people, who declined to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media.
Robusta beans from the current crop are trading at a premium of
$80 to $100 a ton over the London price, traders said.  Raw sugar for October delivery advanced 0.07 cent, or 0.2
percent, to 29.69 cents a pound in New York. White, or refined,
sugar for October delivery slid $4.60, or 0.6 percent, to
$769.40 a ton in London.  India , the world’s second-largest sugar producer after
 Brazil , is likely to be a “steady” importer of the sweetener
over the next 10 years, Olam International Ltd. said. Supply and
demand for sugar will probably be balanced only in two of the
next 10 years, Olam said in a document related to its
announcement today that it bought Hermarus Industries Ltd., a
sugar factory in India, for $73.8 million.  Cocoa for December delivery climbed $13, or 0.4 percent, to
$3,115 a ton on ICE. Cocoa for December rose 2 pounds, or 0.1
percent, to 1,951 pounds ($3,184) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
