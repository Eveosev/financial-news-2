Italy may allow private citizens’
tax statements to be published as part of an attempt to fight
evasion,  Corriere della Sera  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Under a measure included in a 45 billion-euro ($66 billion)
austerity plan being discussed in parliament, municipalities may
be empowered to make the statements public, the Milan-based
newspaper said.  Italy’s regulator for privacy issues in 2008 blocked the
 Finance Ministry  under a previous government from releasing 2005
tax data on its website hours after the Ministry began
publishing the figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
