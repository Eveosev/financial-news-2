The Italian government will drop
proposed changes to pension rules agreed to this week from a
45.5 billion-euro ($66 billion) austerity plan being discussed
in parliament, news Agency Ansa reported, without citing anyone.  The proposal, agreed to by Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi 
and Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  two days ago, would have
excluded time at university and from mandatory military service
from calculations of the retirement age and the pension level
for Italians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
