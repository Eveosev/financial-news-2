Tully Sugar Ltd., a unit of  China ’s
Cofco Ltd., will seek to complete its A$120 million ($128
million) takeover offer for Proserpine Co-operative Sugar
Milling Association Ltd. after a rival bid failed.  “We will be holding discussions with the Proserpine board
today to gain their approval for access to the mill and data
room,” Keith DeLacy, deputy chairman of Cofco’s Top Glory
( Australia ) Pty Ltd. unit, said today in a statement.  Closely held Proserpine, a raw sugar producer in Queensland
state, today rejected a A$115 million takeover bid from  Wilmar
International Ltd. (WIL) ’s Sucrogen unit. Cofco, which won control of
Queensland-based Tully Sugar last month, is seeking to add to
its sugar supply from Australia, the world’s third-largest
shipper of the sweetener, to meet rising demand in China.  Tully will engage with  Proserpine  to ensure loans are put
in place as soon as possible, De Lacy said in the statement.
Tully’s offer involves refinancing A$100 million to repay the
company’s loans and provide immediate working capital, he said.  Tully  will ask Proserpine members to vote to change the
cooperative into a company and convert the debt to equity,
according to the statement.  Sucrogen is still interested in acquiring Proserpine,
though it’s not likely to make further offers, Chief Executive
Officer Ian Glasson said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter for this story:
