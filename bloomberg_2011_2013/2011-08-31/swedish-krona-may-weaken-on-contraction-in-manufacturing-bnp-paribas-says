The krona may weaken tomorrow after
a report economists predict will show Swedish manufacturing
contracted, BNP Paribas SA said.  Sweden’s purchasing managers’ index will show a reading of
49.8 for August, from 50.1 the previous month, according to the
median estimate of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg before
tomorrow’s report. A level above 50 signals expansion. The
Riksbank last month raised its main  interest rate  for a seventh
time in 12 months to 2 percent as it strives to keep inflation
in check after the economy last year grew the most in the
European Union.  “If you do get PMI slowing, particularly if it goes below
50, and if that provides slower rate hikes from the Riksbank,
then that implies a weaker krona,” Steven Saywell, head of
foreign-exchange strategy in  London , said today by phone.  The krona strengthened 0.1 percent to 9.174 per euro at
11:20 a.m. in London. It has weakened 1.5 percent against the
17-nation currency this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
