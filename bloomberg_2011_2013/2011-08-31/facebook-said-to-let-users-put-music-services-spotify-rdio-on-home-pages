Facebook Inc. will let users
incorporate online music services including Spotify Ltd. and
Rdio Inc. on their home pages, said people with knowledge of the
plans.  Facebook will announce the music feature at its Sept. 22
developers  conference  in  San Francisco , said three people, who
requested anonymity because the plans aren’t public. MOG Inc.
will also be included, CNBC reported earlier.  Facebook, the largest social-networking company, is adding
movies and music to strengthen ties to users, while the online
music companies gain a potential audience of 750 million. Time
Warner Inc.’s Warner Bros. has begun renting movies including
“The Dark Knight” on the website. Pandora Inc., Spotify and
Rdio already offer Facebook features on their sites.  “Many of the most popular music services around the world
are integrated with Facebook and we’re constantly talking to our
partners about ways to improve these integrations,” Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for  Mountain View ,  California-based Facebook ,
said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
