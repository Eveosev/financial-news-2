New York gasoline weakened as  Sunoco
Inc. (SUN)  was said to restart a key gasoline-making unit at its
Philadelphia refinery.  Catalytic cracker 1232, which was shut because of a wet-
gas-compressor malfunction late Aug. 29, is operating at reduced
rates, said a person familiar with the situation who declined to
be identified because the information isnâ€™t public.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor widened 2.25 cents to 4.75 cents a gallon at 3:17
p.m. in New York. Prompt delivery rose 1.37 cents to $2.9845 a
gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  weakened 0.62 cent to a
premium of 4.88 cents a gallon versus futures.  Total U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell 2.8 million barrels to
208.6 million last week, according to the Energy Department.
Analysts estimated the government report would show a decline of
1.05 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
