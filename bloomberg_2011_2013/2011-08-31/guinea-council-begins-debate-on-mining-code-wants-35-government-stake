Guinea’s National Council for the
Transition, the equivalent of Parliament, started debate today
on a mining code that proposes government own a 35 percent stake
in commodity companies.  The code recommends a free participation level of 15
percent for the government and the right to buy another 20
percent, according to a copy of the document, handed to
reporters in the capital, Conakry. The code also proposes a
minimum investment by companies of $1 billion before concessions
will be awarded.  Guinea’s government should have an increased role in
bauxite sales, the mining code said, while also suggesting that
 customs duties  on mining equipment be increased and previous
mining rights not be challenged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
