Some dealers for Case IH,  CNH Global
NV (CNH) ’s farm-equipment unit, have attracted interest from private-
equity firms seeking to profit from rising tractor and combine
demand, a Case executive said.  “We have private equity that is interested for the first
time in agribusiness distribution,”  Jim Walker , vice president
of Case IH North America, said yesterday in an interview at the
Farm Progress Show in Decatur, Illinois. “Five years ago you
would’ve never heard of that. It’s a new phenomenon.”  The dealers, who aren’t controlled by CNH or parent Fiat
Industrial SpA, are vital to the success of farm-machinery
manufacturers, he said. It’s not clear how helpful or successful
such investments might be, Walker said. He declined to identify
the private-equity firms.  While investors may have viewed agriculture as cyclical in
the past, they are starting to see it as a “consistent
business” because of rising global food demand, Walker said.  U.S. farm cash receipts from major crops will rise 23
percent to $149.6 billion in the 2011-2012 crop year,  Ann Duignan , an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, said in
an Aug. 11 report. That increasing cash flow is boosting demand
for agricultural equipment made by CNH and competitors  Deere &
Co. (DE)  and  Agco Corp. (AGCO) , Duignan said.  CNH rose 90 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $33.12 as of 4:16 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
dropped 31 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
