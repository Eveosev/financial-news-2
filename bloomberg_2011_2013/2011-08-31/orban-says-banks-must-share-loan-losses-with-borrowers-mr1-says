Hungarian banks must share losses
stemming from foreign-currency loans with borrowers, Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said in an interview on public radio  MR1 
today.  Finding how lenders could share the losses with households
“will be one of the most important tasks of the autumn,” Orban
said.  The government may expand its program designed to help
struggling borrowers, Orban added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
