Promise Co. said it may not be able
to collect 5.25 billion yen ($69 million) in claims owed by AZ
Card Co., a wholly owned unit that filed for liquidation today.  The Japanese consumer lender said in a filing with the
nation’s finance ministry that it booked provisions for the
claims and expects a “minor” impact on its earnings.  Promise had said it will dissolve the unit in a July 15
statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
