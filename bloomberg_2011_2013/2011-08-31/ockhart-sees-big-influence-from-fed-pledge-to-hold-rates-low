Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
President  Dennis Lockhart  said the central bank should have a
significant impact by pledging to hold  interest rates  low
through at least mid-2013, while the commitment may change
should the economy gain strength.  The central bank’s pledge “should have a big influence on
the market,” Lockhart said in response to an audience question
after a speech in Lafayette, Louisiana.  “Even that is conditional to an extent” and “could be
revisited,” Lockhart said. “For the most part, we can count on
it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
