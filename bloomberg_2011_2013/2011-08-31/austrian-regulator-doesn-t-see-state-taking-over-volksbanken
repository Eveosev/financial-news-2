Austria’s Financial Markets
Authority doesn’t expect  Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS)  to be
nationalized, even after it said last week that it may fail to
pay the interest due on 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of state
aid.  “I’m not expecting” Volksbanken to be the third bank to
be taken over by Austria, Helmut Ettl, FMA’s co-chief executive
officer, told reporters at a joint dinner with the central bank
yesterday.  Volksbanken, which failed  Europe ’s stress test last month,
isn’t allowed to pay dividends on the state capital if it has a
loss by Austrian Accounting Principles, according to the terms
of the capital. It hasn’t paid dividends since it received the
bailout in 2008. Austria has the right to get equity in
Volksbanken if the bank fails to pay dividends this year.  The lender is under additional pressure after OAO Sberbank
lowered the offer price agreed to last month for its planned
purchase of Volksbanken’s eastern European unit and a sale of
the bank’s 5 percent in Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG is
less likely to happen this year because RZB’s majority
shareholders didn’t exercise their right to buy the stake.  “We are expecting that the measures agreed on with
Volksbanken will be observed,” Ettl said.  The Alpine republic has nationalized two banks since the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings. It was forced to take over
Kommunalkredit  Austria  AG from Volksbanken and Dexia SA in
November 2008 and Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank International AG in
December 2009, both of which were on the brink of collapse at
the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
