Vietnam ’s  State Securities
Commission  introduced limits for equity margin trading, allowing
securities companies to lend a maximum 40 percent of the value
of equity purchases to investors, the commission said in a
statement on its website late yesterday.  “We aim to regulate lending practices at securities
companies and help them to have better risk management,” Vu Bang, chairman of the stock regulator, said by phone today.  Securities companies can provide the loans to investors for
no longer than three months, the regulator’s statement said.  The benchmark VN Index advanced 1.3 percent today to
424.71, the highest level since July 11. The gauge gained 4.7
percent this month, the world’s second-best performer after
 Venezuela ’s key index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The VN
Index is still down 12 percent this year.  Vietnam ordered lenders on Aug. 29 to set aside more
dollars as reserves for the third time this year to tame  Asia ’s
fastest inflation rate, which reached 23.02 percent in August,
the quickest pace in 33 months.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Darren Boey, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
