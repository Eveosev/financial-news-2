(Corrects to say fine is daily in second paragraph.)  Brazil ’s antitrust regulator ordered
 Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  to suspend some contracts for loans backed by
payrolls with exclusivity rights for the state-run lender as it
investigates if they harm competition.  Banco do Brasil may be fined 1 million reais daily if it
doesn’t suspend the contracts, commissioner Marcos Verissimo
said today at a session of the agency, known as Cade, in
Brasilia.  Brazil allows banks to deduct loan payments from payrolls
in agreements with companies and trade unions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
