Former Bayerische Landesbank risk
manager Gerhard Gribkowsky will stand trial over the sale of the
lender’s stake in Formula One racing,  Focus  reported without
saying where it got the information.  A court allowed breach of trust, accepting bribes and tax
evasion charges to go to trial, the magazine said in preview of
an article for its next edition. Formula One Chief Executive
Officer  Bernie Ecclestone  will testify in the case, according to
Focus.  Rainer Bruessow, Gribkowsky’s lawyer, didn’t immediately
reply to a request for comment left at his voicemail outside
office hours. The attorney said in August the charges were
“far-fetched” and the evidence in the indictment doesn’t back
up the allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
