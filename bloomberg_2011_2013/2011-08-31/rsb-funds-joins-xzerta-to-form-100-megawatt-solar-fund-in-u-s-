Renewable Social Benefit Funds L3C ,
a supplier of clean energy for hospitals and schools, and Xzerta
Energy Group LLC set up a solar fund to produce 100 megawatts of
U.S.-based projects for 2012.  The Sol Haven Fund aims to raise $200 million to $400
million, the companies said in a statement. Xzerta, a renewable
energy financial services firm based in  New York , will ensure
the financing of projects from the fund.  The U.S. Treasury grant incentive program, which was set to
expire at the end of last year, was extended in December until
the end of 2011. The fund aims to benefit from the program,
which reimburses 30 percent of the costs of building solar
systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
