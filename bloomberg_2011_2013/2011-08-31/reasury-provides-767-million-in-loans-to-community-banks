The U.S. Treasury Department  said
today it is providing $767 million in loans to 50 community
banks as part of its Small Business Lending Fund.  The Small Business Lending Fund now has invested more than
$1.8 billion in 130 community banks, the Treasury said in a
statement sent by e-mail. The $30 billion program provides
capital to banks with under $10 billion in assets to encourage
more lending to small businesses.  “These funds will provide a powerful incentive for
community banks to expand their lending to small businesses,
spurring new investment and job creations,” Treasury Deputy
Secretary Neal Wolin said in the written statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
