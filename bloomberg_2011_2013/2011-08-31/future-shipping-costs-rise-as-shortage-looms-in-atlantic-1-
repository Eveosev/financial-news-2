The future cost to hire capesize
vessels that haul  iron ore  rose to a six-month high on
speculation of a ship shortage developing in the Atlantic Ocean.  Forward freight agreements, used to bet or hedge on
expected rents for the dry-bulk fleet, advanced as much as 13
percent to $17,125 a day for October-to-December contracts
today, the highest price since Feb. 18, according to Clarkson
Securities Ltd., a division of the world’s largest shipbroker.
They traded at $16,900 a day by 3:51 p.m. London time.  Average hire costs for the ships gained 18 percent, the
largest advance since May 19 and the highest price since Dec.
24, according to the  Baltic Exchange , a London-based provider of
freight costs. Transatlantic routes gained the most, rising 28
percent to $20,500, an eight-month high.  There are fewer capesize ships available to meet schedules
to load iron ore from  Brazil  and coal from  Colombia  for voyages
to  Europe  and  Asia  because more of the fleet is in the Pacific
Ocean region, said Richard Lee, a trader at  Barclays Capital .  “The foundations have been building all year as high fuel
costs make it unattractive for the newly-built ships to head
west,” Lee said. “The Atlantic has been becoming tighter and
tighter.” New ships scheduled to begin trading in the final
quarter may also be delayed until 2012, further restricting the
number of ships that can be booked, he said.  Rents for the world’s 1,237 capesize ships, comprising 40
percent of the dry-bulk fleet, declined 43 percent in the past
12 months, as growth exceeds supply. The capesize fleet is
forecast to swell by 14 percent in 2011 and outpace demand until
2014, capping any rates recovery, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
said on Aug. 1.  Shipping Costs  Average rents for capesize ships were $19,610 a day,
according to the exchange. The Baltic Dry Index, a broader
measure of shipping costs, gained 5.3 percent to 1,619 points,
the highest since Jan. 5, data show.  Some 70 percent of forecast exports of 1 billion metric
tons of iron ore in 2011 will be shipped from Brazil and
 Australia , according to Clarkson. Dry-bulk vessels handle 39
percent of world trade, according to a July presentation by
Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
