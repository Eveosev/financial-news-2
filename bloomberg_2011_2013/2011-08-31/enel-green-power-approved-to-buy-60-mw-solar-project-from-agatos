Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) ,  Italy ’s
largest renewable energy company, received approval from
antitrust regulators to buy its biggest solar project in the
country so far from local developer Agatos Energia s.r.l.  The acquisition of the 60-megawatt project planned in Trino
Vercellese, northeastern Italy, doesn’t threaten competition in
the energy market, the Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del
Mercato’s weekly bulletin from Aug 29  shows . Enel told the
authority of the planned deal on July 14.  The photovoltaic project is larger than Enel Green Power’s
entire operating solar capacity and would be Italy’s third-
largest plant if completed today, behind the Montalto di Castro
and Rovigo plants.  The company has 38 megawatts in installed solar capacity
and plans to build a further 500 megawatts by 2015, a spokesman
who declined to be named because of corporate policy said today.
He declined to give further details of the acquired project.  Agatos Energia is one of the 570 franchisees of Enel  Green
Power  subsidiary Enel.Si, a provider of solar systems for
households and businesses, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
