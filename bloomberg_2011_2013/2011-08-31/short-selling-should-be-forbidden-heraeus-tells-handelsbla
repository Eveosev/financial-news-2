Juergen Heraeus, the supervisory
board chairman of  Germany ’s Heraeus Holding GmbH, said short-
selling should be forbidden and some financial transactions have
damaged banks’ credibility, Handelsblatt reported.  Rules which require banks to hold more equity and limit
proprietary trading are a step in the right direction, Heraeus
said, according to an interview with the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
