Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., a
unit of  South Korea ’s state-run power monopoly distributor,
plans to spend 6 trillion won ($5.6 billion) in the next 10
years on improving safety of its nuclear reactors.  The company aims to invest as much as 7 percent of its
sales a year until 2020 in developing new reactors with improved
safety technology, the Seoul-based company said in an e-mailed
 statement  today. Research and development costs for safety
account for 6 percent of its sales at present.  The investment will help it manufacture reactors with an
80-year lifespan, compared with 60 years now, the unit of  Korea
Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  said in the statement. A Korea Electric-led
group won a nuclear-plant contract from the  United Arab Emirates 
in 2009, the first such overseas order for a South Korean
company.  Korea Hydro runs 21 reactors in South Korea and is planning
to build seven more by 2017. The safety of nuclear reactors has
become an issue around the world after the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami in  Japan  caused three reactor meltdowns at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant north of Tokyo.  South Korea’s nuclear reactors have been built to withstand
magnitude-6.5 earthquakes, assuming they strike directly
underneath. New ones are being designed to handle temblors with
a magnitude of 7.  South Korea plans to generate 59 percent of its electricity
from nuclear energy by 2030, from about 33 percent now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
