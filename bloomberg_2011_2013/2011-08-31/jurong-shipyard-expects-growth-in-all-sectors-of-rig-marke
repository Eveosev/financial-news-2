Don Lee, senior general manager for
the offshore division at Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd. comments on
oilrig market. He spoke at a conference in Oslo.  The company is a unit of Singapore-based  Sembcorp Marine
Ltd. (SMM) , the world’s second-biggest maker of rigs.  On jack-ups, semi-submersibles:  “In all sectors there will be growth,” he said. “There are
still hundreds of jack-ups that are over 32 years old, and they
will need replacing eventually because of the new requirements
after the Macondo incident. They need higher efficiency rigs.
Old rigs will be retired eventually. They’ll be scrapped and
there are still a lot of these old rigs in the market.”  On rig costs:  “The cost of rigs will go up eventually but how soon and
how fast is something we can’t really tell.  “There’s a lack of shipbuilding in  Korea  so they are coming
in to build the offshore units. But if that market picks up,
then this market will pick up as well.”  On potential over-supply:  “I talk to all the drilling service companies that own the
rigs and they don’t believe so. They believe they still need
more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
