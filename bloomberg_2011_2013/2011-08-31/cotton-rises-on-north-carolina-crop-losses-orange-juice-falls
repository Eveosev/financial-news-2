Cotton futures rose for a fourth
straight session as Hurricane Irene damaged crops in  North
Carolina , further limiting supplies from the U.S., the world’s
biggest exporter. Orange juice dropped.  Irene caused “very significant” damage to farms in North
Carolina and  Virginia , including to cotton, tomato and corn
crops, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said yesterday. The
state is the fourth-biggest grower of the fiber in the U.S.
Before today, the commodity rose 3.6 percent in August as the
worst drought in more than 100 years scorched fields in  Texas ,
the top U.S. producer.  “What we’ve heard about Irene’s impact on North Carolina
is still anecdotal, but that has lent support,” Gary Raines, an
economist and analyst for FCStone LLC in Nashville,  Tennessee ,
said in a telephone interview.  Cotton for December delivery rose 0.66 cent, or 0.6
percent, to $1.0608 a pound at 10:40 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . Prices dropped 27 percent this year before today.  Speculation that excessive rains in Pakistan, the fourth-
largest grower, will reduce yields also supported prices, Raines
said.  “Cotton has been pretty much range-bound, and unless we
break out of resistance above $1.08 to $1.09, I wouldn’t bet
much on this rally,” Raines said.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery declined 0.65
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $1.5695 a pound on ICE. Before today,
the commodity declined 21 percent this month and was down 3.6
percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
