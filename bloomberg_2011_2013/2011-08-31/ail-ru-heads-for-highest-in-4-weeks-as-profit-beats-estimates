Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL)  headed for its
highest in almost four weeks after the Russian Facebook Inc.
investor’s first half-half earnings beat analysts’ expectations.  The shares advanced 7.1 percent in London to $34 by 10:50
a.m., poised for its highest close since Aug. 4.  Net income climbed to $85.6 million in the first half from
$39.7 million a year earlier, Mail.ru said today in a statement.
That beat the average estimate of $69.3 million from six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Mail.ru Group’s strong results came above expectations
and should support the stock price,” Konstantin Belov, an
equity analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., wrote in an e-mailed
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
