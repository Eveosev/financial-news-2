The premium of North Sea Forties
crude to Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than half of
the worldâ€™s oil, rose to the highest level in more than three
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Forties was $1.46 a barrel more than Dated Brent today,
the most since March 18, 2008, compared with a premium of $1.05
yesterday, the data showed. The difference was at a discount
of 16 cents a month ago.  There have been a series of deferrals in Forties shipments
over the past two weeks. A cargo with parcel number F0915 was
delayed by two days to Sept. 20 to Sept. 22, according to a
revised loading program obtained by Bloomberg News. This came
after four lots F0901, F0902, F0906 and F0907 were postponed by
two to five days.  Forties is one of four North Sea crude grades used to price
Dated Brent. The other blends are Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
