Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
said he may support the reintroduction of elections to the upper
house of parliament, the Federation Council, the Interfax news
service reported.  “As far as the Federation Council is concerned, I don’t
rule out that it could be a good idea to return to it being an
elected chamber,” Interfax quoted Medvedev as telling Russian
reporters today in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
