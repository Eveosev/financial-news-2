Oil options volatility decreased as
the underlying futures swung between gains and losses after U.S.
crude supplies increased unexpectedly and equities and gasoline
prices surged.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
October, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 36.4 percent at noon in  New York ,
down from 39.8 percent yesterday. It was 42.6 percent a week
ago.  Oil for October delivery slipped 13 cents to $88.77 a
barrel at 12:37 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Yesterday, it settled at the highest level since Aug. 3. Prices
have fallen 2.9 percent this year.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
October $75 puts, with 2,300 lots changing hands as of 12:45
p.m. The options fell 9 cents to 27 cents a barrel. October $90
calls, the next-most active option, lost 23 cents to $2.15 with
1,290 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts outnumbered calls by 56 percent to 44 percent in
electronic trading on the Nymex.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  October $110 calls were the most active options traded in
