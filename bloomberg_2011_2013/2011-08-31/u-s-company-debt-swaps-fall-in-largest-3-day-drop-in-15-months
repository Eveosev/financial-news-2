Investor confidence in Energy Future
Holdings Corp.’s creditworthiness improved, even as Aurelius
Capital Management LP pushes for a derivatives industry group to
rule that a unit of the utility provider is insolvent.  Credit-default swaps on the Dallas-based company, formerly
called TXU Corp., dropped 1.2 percentage points to 52.5 percent
upfront as of 5 p.m. in  New York , according to data provider
CMA. That’s in addition to 5 percent a year, meaning it would
cost $5.25 million initially and $500,000 annually to protect
$10 million of the company’s debt.  Energy Future led improvement among speculative grade
companies, suggesting investors are skeptical that Aurelius’s
claim will succeed. Confidence in U.S. high-yield, high-risk
debt had the biggest three-day increase since May 2010 as
speculation mounted that the  Federal Reserve  would take steps to
support the economic recovery.  The Markit Group Ltd. CDX North America High Yield Index, a
credit-default swaps index that rises as investor confidence
improves, rose to its highest level in two weeks. It climbed 1
percentage point to 94.965 percent of face value, the highest
level since Aug. 17, the data show.  The extra yield investors demand to hold U.S. junk bonds,
rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than
BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s , instead of similar-maturity  U.S.
government debt  has eased to 739 basis points, or 7.39
percentage points through yesterday, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. High Yield Master II Index.  Energy Future was bought by KKR & Co. and TPG Capital in
2007 in a $43.2 billion transaction, the largest leveraged
buyout in history.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
