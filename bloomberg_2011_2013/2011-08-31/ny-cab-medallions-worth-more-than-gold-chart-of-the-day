A license to drive a New York City
taxi is not only worth more than its weight in gold, investing
in a yellow cab has been more lucrative than the yellow metal.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the cost of a New York City
taxicab license has increased more than 1,000 percent since
1980. The individual ‘medallion’ -- the transferable aluminum
plate found on the hood of all cabs -- sold for $678,000 in
July, according to data compiled from the New York City Taxi and
Limousine Commission, up from $2,500 in 1947.  New York taxi medallion prices rose about eight percent
annually between 1980 and 2011, outpacing inflation, gold, oil,
and  home prices . The price kept growing amid economic slumps and
stock market declines, rising more than 30 percent between
October 2007 and February 2009, when the  U.S. economy  fell into
a recession and the  S&P 500 index  dropped more than 50 percent.  Supporting the price is a tightly controlled supply of
medallions combined with demand from people who are driven to
succeed, said Andrew Murstein, President of  Medallion Financial
Corp (TAXI) , a New York City-based company that provides loans to
purchase taxi medallions.  The price of a medallion has only
declined significantly twice in the past 30 years, he said.
“Once was right after 9/11 and the other time was the oil
embargo of the 1970s.”  Medallions are divided into transferable individual and
corporate licenses, with a corporate medallion selling for
almost $1 million in June 2011, according to the commission. New
York City taxis move about 240 million people each year, more
than the population of  Brazil .  “A guy comes to this country, drives a cab six days a week,
12 hours a day, after three years, takes his whole life savings
and puts it down to buy a medallion,” Murstein said. “This is a
way for him to get a piece of the American dream.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
