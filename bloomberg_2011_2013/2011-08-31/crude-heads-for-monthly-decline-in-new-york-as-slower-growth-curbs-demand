Oil capped its biggest monthly drop
in  New York  since May after the government reported an
unexpected increase in U.S. crude supplies.  Futures declined for the first time in five days as the
Energy Department said oil stockpiles rose the most since April
last week. Prices swung between gains and losses in intraday
trading as gasoline supplies fell to a three-month low and on
gains in gasoline futures and equities.  “Oil is at least slightly weaker and gasoline is
stronger,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “Today’s price action makes sense
because you had tension between the crude and the gasoline. The
positive tone in equities helped the overall market.”  Crude for October delivery slipped 9 cents to settle at
$88.81 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
decreased 7.2 percent in August, the third decline in four
months, and are down 2.8 percent this year.  Brent oil for October settlement gained 83 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $114.85 a barrel, a four-week high, on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
contract was at a premium of $26.04 to U.S. West Texas
Intermediate futures, compared with a record close of $26.21 on
Aug. 19. Brent lost 1.6 percent this month.  Oil Stockpiles Increase  U.S. oil supplies gained 5.28 million barrels, or 1.5
percent, to 357.1 million in the Energy Department report, the
biggest weekly move since the seven days ended April 22. The
median forecast of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a
decline of 500,000 barrels.  Gasoline inventories fell 2.8 million barrels to 208.6
million, the Energy Department report showed. Total products
supplied, a measure of fuel demand, rose 1.7 percent to 19.6
million barrels a day, the first increase in three weeks.  “This is probably something that the bulls will sink their
teeth into to make prices go higher,” said Sean Brodrick, a
natural resource analyst with  Weiss Research  in Jupiter,
 Florida , who forecasts $95-a-barrel oil in the next three weeks.  The  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ’ crude
output in August rose 90,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent, to average
30.03 million barrels a day, a Bloomberg News survey of  oil
companies , producers and analysts showed. It was the highest
level since 2008. Top producer  Saudi Arabia  pumped the most oil
since at least 1989.  Equities Climb  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  erased its loss for 2011
on jobs growth and factory orders reports.  The Commerce Department said orders placed with U.S.
factories rose the most in four months, beating the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. ADP Employer
Services reported companies added 91,000 workers to payrolls,
near the 100,000 median forecast by economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The Dow gained 0.5 percent to 11,613.53 at 4:04 p.m. in New
York, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.5 percent
to 1,218.89.  “Crude is seeing some of the effects of the economic
data,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity
Futures Inc. in New York.  As Tropical Storm Katia strengthened in the Atlantic,
forecasters said a large area of thunderstorms over Cuba and the
western Caribbean could become a tropical system within days.  Tropical Storms  Katia, about 1,100 miles (1,765 kilometers) west of the
southernmost of the Cape Verde Islands, has 65 mph winds and is
speeding west-northwest at 21 mph, the National Hurricane Center
in Miami said in an advisory at 11 a.m. New York time.  The Caribbean system has a 30 percent chance of becoming a
tropical depression or tropical storm in the next 48 hours, the
U.S.  National Hurricane Center  forecast in an advisory at about
1:35 p.m. Miami time. There is “some potential” for it to
develop in the central or western  Gulf of Mexico  by week’s end.  States along the Gulf Coast are home to more U.S.
refineries than any other region.  “The reason we’re supportive on gasoline is the idea that
the storms may shut down some of the refineries,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “A lot
of the traders are nervous that the second storm is going to
gain steam and end up in the Gulf of Mexico.”  East Coast Refineries  Last week, Hurricane Irene shut in processing at refineries
with total capacity of 1.28 million barrels a day in  New Jersey ,
 Pennsylvania  and  Delaware , according to the Energy Department.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) ’s 178,000-barrel-a-day facility at Marcus Hook,
Pennsylvania, and its 335,000-barrel-a-day plant in Philadelphia
are both operating at reduced rates, according to a situation
report from the department’s Office of Electricity Delivery &
Energy Reliability.  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s 238,000-barrel-a-day
Linden, New Jersey, refinery was restarting.  Gasoline for September delivery gained 3.62 cents, or 1.2
percent, to expire at $3.032 a gallon at the close of floor
trading on the Nymex. The more-active October contract rose 3.48
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.8763.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 863,795
contracts as of 3:51 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 665,471
contracts yesterday, 1.6 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.49 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
