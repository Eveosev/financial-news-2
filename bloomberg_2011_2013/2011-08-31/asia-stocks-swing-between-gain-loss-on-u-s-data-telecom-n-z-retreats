Asian stocks rose for a fifth day,
paring the regional benchmark index’s biggest monthly retreat in
more than a year, on speculation the  Federal Reserve  may
announce measures to shore up the  U.S. economy  next month.  Honda Motor Co., the Japanese carmaker that gets about 44
percent of sales from North America, gained 1.5 percent in
Tokyo.  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , a supplier of agricultural
commodities, jumped 11 percent in Singapore after posting higher
fourth-quarter profit. Telecom Corp. of  New Zealand  slumped 3.6
percent in Wellington after releasing details of a demerger and
saying its chief executive officer will step down.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.3 percent to 124.90 at
6:21 p.m. in Tokyo, set for its longest streak of daily advances
since July 4. The gauge is heading for 8.7 percent decline this
month, the most since May 2010, amid concern that global
economic growth is slowing as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
spreads and after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit rating
for the first time.  “The market has priced in most of the negative factors,
and now it depends on the response from policy makers,” said
Koichi Kurose, chief economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd.
“While the market won’t go down easily, to go up it needs a
view that appropriate policies will be implemented.”  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.6 percent, while
South Korea’s Kospi Index increased 2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index advanced 1.6 percent, while  China ’s Shanghai
Composite Index was little changed. Singapore’s Straits Times
Index climbed 3.3 percent, the most since July 2009.  U.S. Futures  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average closed 1.30 points, or
less than 0.1 percent, higher, having swung between gains and
losses at least 10 times, after a report showed Japan’s
industrial production rose less than expected in July. Markets
in Indonesia, Malaysia and  India  were shut for holidays.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1 percent
today. In  New York , the index rose 0.2 percent yesterday after
minutes of the Fed meeting this month showed some policy makers
favored more aggressive action to stimulate the economy. The
Federal Open Market Committee will extend the September 20
policy meeting an extra day to “allow a fuller discussion” of
the slowing economy and the central bank’s possible policy
response, Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said Aug. 26.  Exporters advanced on speculation shipments to the U.S.,
the biggest market for Asian products, will rise if the Fed
announces new stimulus measures. Honda Motor gained 1.5 percent
to 2,474 yen in Tokyo.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s fourth-
largest maker mobile phones by sales, climbed 4.1 percent to
66,600 won in Seoul.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and
clothes to U.S. retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
increased 3.5 percent to HK$14.04.  ‘Downward Pressure’  “There’s still downward pressure on stocks,” said John Woods, Hong Kong-based chief Asian strategist at Citigroup
Inc.’s private bank. “I can’t see why there’s going to be a
compelling rebound in stock prices until we see clarity on the
economic growth outlook.”  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  fell as much as 1.2 percent before
recovering yesterday after the New York-based Conference Board’s
index of U.S. consumer confidence slumped to 44.5, the weakest
reading since April 2009, from a revised 59.2 reading in July.  Of the 700 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
posted net income since July 11, 44 percent exceeded estimates,
while 35 percent fell short, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Olam, one of the world’s top three suppliers of rice, cocoa
and coffee, jumped 11 percent to S$2.59 in Singapore after
saying fourth-quarter profit climbed 38 percent from a year
earlier.  Wing Tai Holdings Ltd. (WINGT) , a property developer in
Singapore, advanced 8.4 percent to S$1.36 after reporting
fourth-quarter net income more than doubled.  Telecom New Zealand  Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd. (460) , a drugmaker in
China, surged 14 percent to HK$3.04 in Hong Kong, the most on
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, after posting a 49 percent increase
in first-half profit.  Among stocks that dropped, Telecom New Zealand slumped 3.6
to NZ$2.54 after saying the split of its retail and
infrastructure businesses will be completed by the end of
November. A search for new chief executive officer to replace

4.4 percent to 13,400 yen.  Taiheiyo Cement Corp., a supplier of the building material,

billion yen ($490 million) by selling shares to the public.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 10 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 3.6 percent drop by the  S&P
