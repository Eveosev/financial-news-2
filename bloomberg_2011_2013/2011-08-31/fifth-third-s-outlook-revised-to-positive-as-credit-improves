Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) , Ohio’s largest
lender, had its outlook revised to positive from stable by
Standard & Poor’s, which said the bank’s credit quality
continues to improve.  The revision is attributed to the bank’s “improved”
financial condition related to asset quality, capital and
earnings, S&P said today in a statement. Cincinnati-based Fifth
Third has had lower levels of net charge-offs during the past
three quarters and its financial condition is supported by
“strong” pretax, pre-provision earnings, according to the
statement. S&P kept the lender’s credit rating at BBB.  “We expect Fifth Third to record higher-than-normal credit
costs through 2011 but believe that these should be
manageable,” S&P said in the statement. “If asset quality does
not continue to improve or if earnings or capital materially
weaken, then we may revise the outlook to stable or negative.”  Fifth Third rose 1.5 percent to $10.62 at 4:15 p.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have fallen 28 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
