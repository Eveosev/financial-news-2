Israel ’s three biggest banks beat
analysts’ estimates for second-quarter profit, sending the
banking index toward its highest close in more than three weeks.  The  Tel Aviv Banking Index (TABANK) , which includes the five biggest
lenders, gained 1.2 percent to 1,107.58, poised for its highest
close since Aug. 8. The index has dropped 15 percent in the past
six months, underperforming the benchmark TA-25 that fell 12
percent in the same period.  Bank Hapoalim Ltd., the second-biggest bank, led the gains,
rising 3 percent to 14.91 shekels at 1:36 p.m.  Israel Discount
Bank Ltd. (DSCT)  was up 2.9 percent to 6.13 shekels, while Bank
Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. fell 0.6 percent to 13.17 shekels.  “The main conclusion here is that Hapoalim is the
leader,” said Adi Scop, analyst at Israel Brokerage &
Investments. “It had the largest profit.”  Hapoalim’s net income rose 43 percent from a year earlier
to 712 million shekels, 11 percent more than the 643 million-
shekel mean estimate by five analysts. Leumi, Israel’s largest
bank by assets, said net income rose 10.7 percent to 563 million
shekels ($158 million), beating the mean estimate of 535 million
shekels by five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Second-quarter profit at Discount rose 48 percent to 231
million shekels, above the mean estimate of 192 million shekels
by four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  earlier today kept
the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 3.25 percent for a
third month as the economy expanded and inflation slowed.  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects the rate of
inflation traders expect, dropped to 206.9 on Aug. 22, the
lowest in at least 14 months. The rate increased two basis
points to 2.24 percent today.  While the most recent quarter was a good for banks, “the
bad news is that in the third quarter we are expecting to see
higher losses from derivatives on the back of falling yields in
 government bonds ,” said Alon Glazer at Leader Capital Markets.  Banks results are likely to worsen because of “an increase
in provisions, the impact of the derivatives and a hit from the
capital markets,” Glazer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
