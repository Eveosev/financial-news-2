Growth in  East Asia ’s local-currency
debt markets slowed in the second quarter as central banks sold
fewer short-term bonds, according to the  Asian Development Bank .  The value of outstanding debt in the region’s emerging
markets climbed 7.7 percent from a year earlier to $5.5
trillion, compared with an increase of 10.4 percent in the first
quarter, the Manila-based lender said in its Asia Bond Monitor
report today. Sales of local-currency notes fell 20.7 percent to
$789 billion, with issuance by central banks dropping 41.8
percent and those by companies rising 10.7 percent.  Emerging-market economies are being seen as a haven, it
said, as concerns about public finances in the U.S. and Europe
persist. Rupiah notes have led gains among  Asia ’s bonds, having
returned 15.2 percent this year through July, according to the
Asian Bond Fund Pan-Asian Bond Index.  “Capital flows into emerging East Asian bond markets
remain strong as higher yields, relatively strong economic
fundamentals and the potential appreciation of regional
currencies pull investors,” the ADB said.  Growth in east Asia’s economies is expected to moderate and
remain “relatively strong” in the second half of the year, the
ADB said. The lender classified  China ,  Hong Kong , Indonesia,
Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam as the region’s emerging markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
