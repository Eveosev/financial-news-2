French companies are meeting
government officials next week to discuss business opportunities
under the new government in  Libya .  The Sept. 6 meeting in Paris, planned two weeks ago, will
give companies the possibility to discuss projects in Libya with
French Ambassador to Libya Francois Gouyette and the envoy to
the National Transitional Council, Antoine Sivan, and the
 Franco-Libyan chamber of commerce  chief, Michel Casals, said a
spokeswoman for the French business federation known as Medef by
telephone today.  Companies will discuss talks they have had with the rebel
leaders who are likely to take over power in the oil-rich
nation, said the spokeswoman. Names of companies participating
will not be disclosed and the session will be held behind closed
doors. The spokeswoman declined to be named.  Libyan rebel leaders will be in Paris tomorrow for a
conference including global officials such as German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel , U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron and President
Nicolas Sarkozy of France.  Total SA (FP)  executives plan to visit Libya in September to see
about resuming business there, Reuters said, citing Casals. They
would join a group of French companies to Libya, possibly
alongside  Alstom SA (ALO) , European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.,
 Thales SA (HO)  and Alcatel-Lucent SA, Reuters said yesterday.  Total spokeswoman Phenelope Semavoine declined to comment
on the Sept. 6 meeting and the possibility of meetings between
company representatives and Libyan authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
