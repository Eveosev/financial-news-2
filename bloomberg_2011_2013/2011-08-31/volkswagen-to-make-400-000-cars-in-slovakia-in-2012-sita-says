Volkswagen AG plans to assemble
400,000 vehicles next year at its Slovak factory,  SITA  reported,
citing the unitâ€™s Chief Executive Officer Andreas Tostmann.  The German carmaker produced 94,600 vehicles in Slovakia in
the first half of 2011, the newswire said. The planned increase
will be driven by the start later this year of serial production
of the so-called New Small Family cars, SITA said citing
Tostmann.  To contact the reporter on this story:
