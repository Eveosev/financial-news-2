Liberian voters have rejected four
proposals to amend the West African nation’s constitution,
including a plan to delay national elections for one month, the
National Elections Commission announced.  All four propositions in an Aug. 23 referendum failed to
win the two-thirds majority required to change the constitution,
the commission said today in Monrovia, the capital.  The acting chairman of the panel, Elizabeth Nelson, told a
press conference that 34.2 percent, or 615,703 out of 1.7
million registered voters, took part in the referendum.  The voters rejected amendments to raise the retirement age
of judges on Liberia’s  Supreme Court  from 70 to 75; reduce
residency requirements for presidential hopefuls from 10 to five
years; allow legislators in bye-elections to win with a simple
majority; and change the election date from the second Tuesday
in October to the second Tuesday in November.  The Congress for Democratic Change party, led by  George
Weah , had called on its members to boycott the referendum and
claimed victory today over the ruling Unity Party.  Vice President Joseph Boakai of the Unity Party said the
referendum process is an unfamiliar concept for most Liberians
and the presence of four ballot issues may have thrown off some
voters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
