U.S. stock-index futures maintained
gains after ADP Employer Services said American companies added
91,000 jobs last month.  Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring in September climbed 0.9
percent to 1,216 at 8:16 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures increased 93 points, or 0.8 percent, to 11,585.  The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News called for ADP to report a gain of 100,000 jobs. Over the
previous six reports, ADP’s initial figure was closest to the
Labor Department’s first estimate of private payrolls in
February, when it understated the gain in jobs by 5,000. The
estimate was least accurate in June, when it overestimated the
increase in employment by 100,000.   The S&P 500 has rallied 4.6 percent over the last three
days as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told the
central bank’s yearly gathering in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, that
the Fed was prepared to do more to foster a stronger recovery.
That pared the index’s decline in August to 6.1 percent, its
largest monthly slump since May 2010.  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent yesterday after the Federal
Open Market Committee disclosed minutes from its latest meeting,
showing that several members favored a “more substantial move”
beyond the pledge adopted by the panel to hold  interest rates  at
record lows for the next two years.  A U.S. Commerce Department report due at 10 a.m. in
Washington will show that factory orders rose 2 percent in July
after a 0.8 percent decline in June, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists.  Futures extended gains earlier as German  Chancellor Angela
Merkel ’s Cabinet ratified expanded measures to combat the euro-
area’s sovereign-debt crisis. Ministers meeting in Berlin today
backed a reworked European Financial Stability Facility with
sovereign bond-buying powers, raising Germany’s share of EFSF
loan guarantees to 211 billion euros ($305 billion) from 123
billion euros. European leaders agreed to introduce the measures
at a summit on July 21.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
