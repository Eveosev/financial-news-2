Russia’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds
due 2020 climbed for a fifth day, pushing the yield to its
lowest level in almost 10 months, as $114 crude oil spurred
demand for the country’s bonds.  Standard & Poor’s  affirmed its
rating on the country’s debt.  The yield on the dollar-denominated notes, rated BBB by
S&P, dropped 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 4.13
percent as of 6:22 p.m. in Moscow, the lowest level since Nov. 4
based on closing prices. Dollar debt due 2015 yielded 16 basis
points less than yesterday at 2.725 percent, the lowest since
Aug. 4.  “The risk trade is on again,” Nikolay Podguzov, head of
fixed-income strategy at VTB Capital in Moscow, said by e-mail.
“Russia automatically appears on investors’ radar as one of the
most attractive segments of the market. Oil is high, and the
sovereign is fundamentally strong.”  A 24 percent gain this year in Urals crude oil,  Russia ’s
main export blend, has limited the country’s need to borrow on
international markets. The country’s ratio of debt to gross
domestic product is 9.3 percent, compared with 42.7 percent for
similarly rated  Mexico , the Finance Ministry said in a  report 
published on its website Aug. 8.  Urals crude traded at $114.48 a barrel today, 52 cents less
than the $115-a-barrel average price Russia needs to balance its
budget this year. Urals has averaged $109.13 in 2011.  Ratings Weakness  Russia’s “net asset position, reflecting past fiscal
surpluses and current moderate deficits,” led S&P to affirm the
sovereign rating, Kai Stukenbrock, the agency’s director of
sovereign ratings for  Europe , the  Middle East  and  Africa , said
in an e-mailed statement today. At the same time, the economy’s
sensitivity to oil-price movements is a “ratings weakness,”
according to the statement.  “If the government fails to address its large non-oil
deficit, and if that were accompanied by an extended slump in
 oil prices , it could eventually result in ratings downside,”
Stukenbrock wrote.  The ruble was strengthened 0.2 percent to 28.8725 per
dollar and 0.4 percent to 41.5936 per euro. That left it up 0.3
at 34.5937 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Russia’s currency weakened 4.3 percent against the dollar
in August, losing more than all three of its peers in the so-
called BRIC group of emerging-market countries.  Brazil ’s real
fell 4 percent against the greenback,  India ’s rupee slipped 3.9
percent and  China ’s yuan appreciated 0.8 percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps lost nine basis points to
192 today, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. That’s the biggest daily fall since
Aug. 15 based on closing prices, the data show.  The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government
or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
