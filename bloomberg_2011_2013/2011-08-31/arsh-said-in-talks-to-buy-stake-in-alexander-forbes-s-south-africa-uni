Alexander Forbes Ltd. (AFP) ,  Africa ’s
largest independent retirement-fund administrator, said it will
combine its corporate and commercial broking business in South
Africa with Marsh Ltd., the insurance business of New York-based
Marsh & McLennan Cos.  “Marsh South Africa will assume the approximately 419
million rand ($59.8 million) and 37 million rand of loans
owed,” Johannesburg-based Alexander Forbes said in a statement
today. “Alexander Forbes Risk Services Africa and Marsh SA will
benefit from an enhanced ability to access national and global
resources and deploy them regionally across the combined
footprint of 11 countries and its network of correspondents to
create a highly competitive African presence.”  Alexander Forbes was founded in 1935 as Price Forbes and
provides risk, insurance, health, retirement and multimanager
investment solutions internationally with its primary operations
based in  South Africa  and brokers in the rest of Africa and the
U.K.  Alexander Forbes trades preference shares on South Africa’s
stock exchange in Johannesburg. The shares slid 30 cents, or 3.8
percent, to 7.60, its lowest level since July 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
