Eric LeGrand, a Rutgers University
football player who was paralyzed during a 2010 game, joined the
school’s sports radio network.  LeGrand, who wants to be a sports broadcaster after
graduation, sustained a spinal cord injury Oct. 16 in a game
against Army.  “It’s really cool,” coach Greg Schiano said on the
school’s website. “He’s going to do post, pre and halftime. So
we’re going to get our E-Rock report.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
