Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , the Indian
company that is Asiaâ€™s third-largest maker of wind turbines,
plans to develop a A$1.3 billion ($1.4 billion) wind farm in
 South Australia , according to the state government.  The 600-megawatt project would produce enough electricity
to power more than 200,000 homes a year, Mike Rann, premier of
the Australian state, said today  in a statement  on his website.
Suzlon expects to complete the 180-turbine wind farm on the
Yorke Peninsula by the end of 2015, he said.  The proposed Ceres wind farm requires regulatory, planning
and environmental approvals, according to the statement. South
Australia has projects producing 1,150 megawatts of wind
capacity, more than 21 percent of its total electricity
generation, Rann said.  Australia is moving toward a target of generating 20
percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources such as
wind farms by 2020.  AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK)  said last year it expected
the 420-megawatt Macarthur wind farm in the state of Victoria to
become the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
