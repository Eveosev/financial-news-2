Shui On Centre Co. is scheduled to
complete syndication of a HK$2.5 billion ($321 million) loan
Sept. 1, according to a person familiar with the matter.  About 30 banks were invited to join the three-year
facility, which refinances and increases a HK$2.2 billion, five-
year loan signed in June 2007, the person said, asking not to be
identified as details are private.  Bank of China Ltd. ( Hong Kong ) and Standard Chartered Plc
were hired to arrange the new facility, which pays a margin of
245 basis points more than the Hong Kong interbank offered rate
for a so-called all-in fee of 290 basis points, the person said.
The two banks began marketing the loan to other lenders on Aug.
11, the person said.  Shui On Centre Co. is a unit of Shui On Holdings Ltd., the
property investment arm of Shui On Group Co., the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
