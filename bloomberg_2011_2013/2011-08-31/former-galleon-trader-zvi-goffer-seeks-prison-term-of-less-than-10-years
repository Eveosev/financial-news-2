Zvi Goffer, the former Galleon Group
LLC trader convicted of  insider trading , told a judge he’s a
changed man and asked to be sentenced to less than the 10 years
in prison called for under U.S. sentencing guidelines.  Goffer was convicted in June in  Manhattan  federal court of
all 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud against him.
Goffer, his brother Emanuel Goffer and Michael Kimelman were
charged with using tips from two lawyers to profit on trades in
3Com Corp., Axcan Pharma Inc., Kronos Inc. and Hilton Hotels
Corp. Jurors heard recordings of wiretapped phone calls.  In a sentencing memorandum filed today, Goffer claimed his
two young sons have changed him from the man he was when he
committed the crimes.  “The arrogant swagger of 2007 has been replaced with an
honest humility in 2011,” according to the court filing.
“Today, Zvi Goffer is a truly remorseful and humbled man.”  The Zvi Goffer verdict came about a month after his former
boss, Galleon co-founder  Raj Rajaratnam , was found guilty in the
same courthouse of directing the biggest hedge fund  insider-
trading scheme  in history.  Sullivan today sentenced Craig Drimal, a former Galleon
hedge fund trader who pleaded guilty in the case, to 5 1/2 years
in prison.  The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
