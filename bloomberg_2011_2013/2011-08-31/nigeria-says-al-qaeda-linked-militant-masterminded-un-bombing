Nigeria ’s State Security Service
said a militant linked to al-Qaeda masterminded the Aug. 26
bombing of a United Nations building that killed 23 people and
wounded 71 in the capital, Abuja.  The security service has arrested two suspects, which it
identified as leaders of the militant Boko Haram group
responsible for series of attacks in northern Nigeria, in
connection with the bombing, spokeswoman Marilyn Ogar said in an
e-mailed statement.  The agency identified the al-Qaeda-linked suspect, who is
still at large, as Mamman Nur and said he recently returned from
Somalia.  The blast occurred after a suicide bomber driving a Honda
CRV crashed into the reception area of the building housing 26
UN organizations. Boko Haram, a militant Islamic sect which
draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, claimed
responsibility for the attack, the  BBC  and the Abuja-based Daily
Trust newspaper reported, citing phone calls by a spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
