The  International Monetary Fund  and
 Serbia  agreed on an 18-month precautionary loan arrangement
worth 1 billion euros ($1.44 billion) that also envisages a
bigger 2011 budget gap and slower economic growth,  Tanjug   news
agency  reported, citing a government source it did not name.  The IMF accepted that Serbia’s budget deficit this year
will be 4.5 percent of gross domestic product instead of the
originally planned 4.25 percent amid smaller-than-expected state
revenue. It will also revise Serbia’s growth forecast to 2
percent from 3 percent in 2011, the report said.  Serbia will still have to trim spending another 15 billion
dinars ($210 million) to 20 billion dinars to fit into the new
deficit plan, now revised to 132 billion dinars from 120.5
billion dinars previously for the central budget, and to 153
billion dinars from 140 billion dinars consolidated that
includes shortfalls of local governments, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
