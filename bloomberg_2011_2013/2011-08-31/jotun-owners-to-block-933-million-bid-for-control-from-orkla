Jotun AS, the paint company that’s
the target of a $933 million takeover offer from  Orkla ASA (ORK) , will
block attempts by the Norwegian maker of pizzas and bathroom
cleaners to seize control, according to Chairman Odd Gleditsch.  The Gleditsch family, which holds about 59 percent of the
voting rights in Jotun, wants to remain long-term owners, the
chairman said today in a telephone interview. Orkla offered
70,000 kroner ($13,075) a share for the remaining Class A stock
it doesn’t already own, a move that would give it 90.9 percent
of the voting rights.  “The family has always said they want to remain long-term
owners and the offer does not change that for me personally,”
Gleditsch said. “It’s highly unlikely that Orkla will gain
control.”  Orkla, which already holds 38.2 percent of the  voting
rights  in Jotun, said today that paints and coatings is a market
well aligned with its long-term strategy and that buying Jotun
could be a way for the company to participate in the future
consolidation of the industry. Orkla is banking on some members
of the family offering up their shares, said spokesman Johan Chr
Hovland by phone.  Shares of Orkla were little changed at 44.25 kroner as of
11:15 a.m. in Olso trading. The stock has lost 22 percent this
year, cutting the company’s market value to 45.5 billion kroner.  Orkla has sold industrial units, including silicon-products
maker Elkem, to focus on consumer-oriented businesses spanning
chocolate and food ingredients.  Orkla currently holds 41,981 class A shares of the voting
rights in Jotun. An A-class share entitles the holder to 10
times as many votes as a B-class one. The transaction would lift
Orkla’s holding in Sandefjord-based Jotun to 63.6 percent from
42.5 percent, it said.  “Jotun’s strong brand and market position offer good
opportunities for long-term global growth,” Chief Executive
Officer Bjoern Wiggen said in today’s statement.  Jotun, which is not publicly listed, last year had sales of
13.4 billion kroner, according to its website. The company has
38 production plants globally and 7,800 employees.  Today’s offer is conditional upon Orkla gaining a stake of
more than 50 percent of the voting rights. The acceptance period
expires on Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
