A  Venoco Inc. (VQ)  investor sued to block
a bid by the company’s founder to take the oil and gas producer
private.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Timothy Marquez’s
$770.2 million offer is unfair to shareholders and undervalues
the company, shareholder James G. Prince said today in a
complaint in Delaware Chancery Court. Prince asked that the case
be a class-action suit including other Venoco shareholders.  “Marquez strategically timed the proposed transaction
during a period of economic turmoil in which the terms of the
proposed transaction could be superficially viewed in a positive
light,” lawyers for Prince wrote.  Marquez, who holds 50.3 percent of the Denver-based oil and
gas company’s shares, offered this week to buy the rest for
$12.50 each.  Phil McPherson, a  Newport Beach , California-based analyst
with Global Hunter Securities LLC, said Aug. 29 that the offer
represents a significant discount to the value of the company’s
assets and may prompt investor lawsuits and a potentially higher
bid from another oil producer.  Venoco, founded in 1992, is the second-largest landholder
in  California ’s Monterey oil-shale formation.  Mike Edwards, a spokesman for Venoco, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment on the complaint.  Venoco fell 17 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $11.59 at 3:14
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have fallen 35 percent in the past year.  The case is Prince v. Venoco Inc., CA6823, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
