Brazilian renewable energy
developers may have trouble delivering electricity profitably
after agreeing to sell power at the world’s cheapest rates for
wind power, according to a research company.  Companies including the state-controlled utility Eletrosul
Centrais Eletricas SA and  Renova Energia SA (RNEW11)  agreed to sell wind
power at rates that are below the wholesale electricity prices
in many Latin American markets, London-based Bloomberg New
Energy Finance said today in a statement.  To fulfill those contracts, developers will need to buy
turbines for about $1.2 million a megawatt, said Eduardo Tabbush, wind analyst at New Energy Finance. That’s 10 percent
below the global average price and 15 percent less than prices
in Brazil.  “These remarkably low bids have set the bar very high,”
Tabbush said in the statement. “Now they must clear it by
either getting exceptional performance from their  wind turbines ,
or by sourcing equipment and capital much more inexpensively
than we’ve seen to date.”  In two government-organized auctions in  Brazil  last month,
developers agreed to sell power from wind farms with 1.9
gigawatts of capacity at an average price of 99.58 reais
($62.70) a megawatt-hour. That was lower than the average price
for natural gas in Brazil and the cheapest price for wind
anywhere in the world, Tabbush said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
