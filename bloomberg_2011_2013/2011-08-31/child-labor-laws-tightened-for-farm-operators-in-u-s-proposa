Farm operators putting children to
work face stricter limits in the first revision of agricultural
safety rules in four decades, the U.S. Labor Department said.  “Children employed in agriculture are some of the most
vulnerable workers in America,” Labor Secretary Hilda Solis
said today on a conference call with reporters. “We will
continue our enforcement of child-labor laws.”  Among the rules, workers under age 16 would be barred from
cultivating, harvesting and curing tobacco on a farm. The rules
also restrict young workers on and off farms from using
electronic devices for activities such as talking, texting or
playing games when operating power-driven equipment.  Job-related deaths of children occur more often in family
businesses and agriculture, according to a Labor Department
report. On farms, youths 15 to 17 years old had a risk of death
more than 4.4 times higher than the average for all workers in
the age group, according to the report.  The proposed rule wouldn’t apply to minors working on farms
owned by their parents, Michael Hancock, assistant administrator
for policy in the agency’s wage and hour division, said on the
call.  The agency will seek comment until Nov. 1, after
publication in the Federal Register on Sept. 2, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
