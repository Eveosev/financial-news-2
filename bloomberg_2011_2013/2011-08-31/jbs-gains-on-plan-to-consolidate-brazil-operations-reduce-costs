JBS SA (JBSS3)  advanced after the world’s
biggest beef producer said it plans to consolidate its Brazilian
operations into fewer units to reduce costs.  JBS gained 1.2 percent to 4.13 reais at 11:40 a.m. New York
time. Shares dropped 12 percent this month through yesterday,
while the benchmark Bovespa index slid 5.8 percent during the
same period.  The meatpacker will halt its Presidente Epitacio plant in
Sao Paulo state and transfer part of operations from five other
Brazil units to different plants, according to a regulatory
filing yesterday. The company said it expects to save 200
million reais ($126 million) a year once the changes are made.  With the plan, the company will “concentrate production on
its most modern plants,” Erick Guedes and Fernando Labes,
analysts at Banco J. Safra SA, wrote in a note to clients. “We
consider the news positive and we believe there is still more to
be obtained from operating improvements in Brazilian
operations.”  The U.S. accounted for 73 percent of the company’s revenue
in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JBS reported
second-quarter net loss of 180.8 million reais, after posting a
profit of 3.7 million reais one year earlier, according to a
filing Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
