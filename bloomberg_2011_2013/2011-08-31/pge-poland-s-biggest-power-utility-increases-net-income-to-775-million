PGE SA, Poland’s largest power
utility, said first-half net income rose to 2.22 billion zloty
($775 million) from 1.5 billion zloty a year earlier. That
compares with the 2.16 billion-zloty mean estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Earnings before interest and taxes rose to 2.77 billion
zloty from 2.28 billion zloty, beating the mean estimate of 2.67
billion zloty.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
