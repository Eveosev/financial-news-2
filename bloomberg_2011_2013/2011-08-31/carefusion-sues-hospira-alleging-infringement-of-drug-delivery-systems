CareFusion Corp. (CFN)  sued  Hospira Inc. (HSP) 
over patents for drug-delivery systems and is seeking a  jury
trial , damages and an order barring infringement.  Hospira, based in  Lake Forest , Illinois, is using protected
technology in products including the  Symbiq , Plum and LifeCare
brand of infusion equipment, CareFusion said in papers filed
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “The evidence will likely show” that Hospira has “acted
with disregard of CareFusion’s patent rights, without any
reasonable basis for doing so,” and should pay lost profits and
royalties to San Diego-based CareFusion, according to the
complaint.  CareFusion itself was sued Aug. 29 in federal court in
Chicago by rival B. Braun Medical Inc. over infusion-pump
patents, according to a B. Braun statement.  “We think we’ve got a strong position in this suit and our
plan is to vigorously defend it,” said Hospira spokeswoman
Tareta Adams in a telephone interview.  CareFusion, with $3.52 billion in sales last fiscal year,
rose 44 cents to $25.68 at 12:52 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Hospira, with $3.91 billion in 2010 sales,
rose 54 cents or more than one percent to $46.50 on the NYSE.  The case is CareFusion v. Hospira, 11-762, U.S. District
Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 7,171,277; 7,835,927.  To contact the reporters on this story:
