Woolworths Holdings Ltd.,  Truworths
International Ltd. (TRU)  and  Foschini Group Ltd. (TFG)  surged to records
after Citigroup Inc. named the South African retailers top
“buys” among emerging-market consumer stocks.  Woolworths rose to the strongest closing level since
October 1997, gaining 3.5 percent to 36.45 rand at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, while Truworths increased for a third
day, rising 1 percent to 77.55 rand. Foschini rallied 2.4
percent to 95.10 rand, the highest since August 1990.  Discretionary consumer stocks were raised to “overweight”
from “neutral” at Citigroup, which expects declines in equity
and commodity prices will reduce the risk of inflation and
interest-rate increases, analysts including New York-based
Geoffrey Davis wrote in an e-mailed report today.  The world economy will grow 3.8 percent this year and 4
percent in 2012 in purchasing power parity terms, down from 4.2
percent and 4.4 percent, Citigroup said Aug. 25. It expects
growth of “around 6 percent” in emerging markets for 2011-12,
it said today. UBS cut its estimate for global expansion next
year to 3.3 percent from 3.8 percent and Societe Generale SA
pared its forecast to 3.9 percent from 4.6 percent.  “Significant downgrades to GDP forecasts for 2011 and 2012
have centered on developed economies, rather than emerging
markets,” the analysts wrote. “We would play these themes by
adding weight to the consumer discretionary sector, particularly
the interest-rate sensitive areas.”  Emerging-market stocks are headed for a 9.8 percent drop
this month, a fourth of decreases, according to the MSCI index
on concern the global economic recovery is faltering and as the
U.S. was stripped of its top AAA rating by  Standard & Poor’s .  “The apparent cancellation of virtually all remaining rate
hikes for the rest of 2011 and most of 2012 supports our long-
term bullish stance on emerging-market equities,” the analysts
wrote.  Steinhoff International Holdings Ltd. (SHF) ,  Africa ’s largest
furniture maker, was also named as a preferred stock in the
report. The stock increased for a third day, advancing 3.3
percent to 23.10 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
