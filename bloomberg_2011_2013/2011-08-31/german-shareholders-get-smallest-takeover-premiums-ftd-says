German shareholders earn less from
takeovers than their counterparts elsewhere in  Europe  or the
U.S., Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing a study by
law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.  Shareholders of corporations listed in  Germany  in 2010 on
average received a 4.25 percent premium on the required minimum
bid price. In the first half of 2011 the number was 7.9 percent,
the newspaper said in a preview of an article to be published in
tomorrowâ€™s edition.  Investors in Europe on average are offered a premium of 30
percent and shareholders of U.S.-listed companies get a 45
percent premium, according to FTD. The difference is a result of
less strict takeover rules in German law, FTD cited the study as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
