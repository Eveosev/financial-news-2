Kansas  was ordered to continue
making quarterly payments to Planned Parenthood of Kansas and
Mid-Missouri while it appeals an Aug. 1 ruling that had
temporarily restored funding.  U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Marten in Kansas City today
denied a request by the state to make monthly payments while the
appeal is pending.  “The intent of the court’s order was to restore and
maintain the prior status quo between the parties, a
relationship which was premised on quarterly installment
payments of a portion of the subgrant, not a monthly
reimbursement schedule,” Marten said.  Marten on Aug. 1 granted Planned Parenthood’s request for
an order blocking a state law that made the  Overland Park ,
Kansas-based organization ineligible for federal money the group
said paid for cancer screenings, breast exams,  birth control  and
basic family planning for the poor and the uninsured.  James Armstrong, a lawyer representing Kansas, didn’t
immediately return a call to his office after regular business
hours.  The case is Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri
v. Brownback, 11-cv-2357, U.S. District Court, District of
Kansas (Kansas City).  To contact the reporter on this story:
