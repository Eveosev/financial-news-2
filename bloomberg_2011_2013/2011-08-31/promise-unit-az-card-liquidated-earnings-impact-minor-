Promise Co., a Japanese consumer-
finance company, said wholly owned unit AZ Card Co. filed for
liquidation today. AZ Card’s closure is expected to have a
“minor” impact on Promise’s earnings for the current fiscal
year, according to a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Promise had disclosed on July 15 its decision to dissolve
the unit and book provisions for 5.25 billion yen ($69 million)
in claims owed by AZ Card.  To contact the reporter on this story:
