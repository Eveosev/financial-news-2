UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V) ,  Europe ’s second-
biggest papermaker, will close two publication paper mills in
Finland and  Germany  as well as some paper machines to reduce
capacity.  About 1,170 jobs will be cut by the end of 2011 as the
mills in Albbruck, Germany and Myllykoski, Finland are
shuttered, the Helsinki-based papermaker said in a statement
today. Shares of UPM climbed 7.2 percent to 9.11 euros as of
10:34 a.m. local time.  “With the planned actions we would respond to the magazine
paper overcapacity challenge,” Chief Executive Officer Jussi
Pesonen said in the statement. “We would ensure the efficient
use of our remaining capacity. However, this plan would not
solve the cost challenges of the industry.”  The move follows this year’s purchase of Myllykoski and
Rhein Paper for about 900 million euros ($1.3 billion) as the
industry consolidates in response to higher production costs and
a shift in demand to digital publications. The  paper industry  is
faced with “severe challenges” amid higher costs for raw
materials, energy, and logistics, Pesonen said.  UPM said it will make a provision for 200 million euros of
restructuring costs this quarter and sees a write-off of about
70 million euros in fixed assets. Annual savings from the
integration of Myllykoski will be about 200 million euros, the
papermaker said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
