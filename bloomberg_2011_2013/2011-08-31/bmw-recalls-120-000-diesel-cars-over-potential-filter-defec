Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  will
recall 120,000 diesel cars of it 1 and 5 Series worldwide over a
potential filter defect.  The defect could cause the filter heater to continue to run
after the engine is switched off, company spokeswoman Susanne
Spatz said in an interview today. In a worst-case scenario, the
defect, which BWM detected on its own, could cause a fire, she
said. Customers will be notified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
