China ’s interest-rate swaps rose for
a fifth month on speculation policy makers will curb the
availability of cash to stem inflation running at the fastest
pace since 2008.  The increase in the  consumer price index  this year is
unlikely to be less than 5 percent, compared with the
government’s 4 percent target, the China National Radio
reported, citing  Wang Jian , secretary-general of the China
Society of Macroeconomics. Lenders were ordered on Aug. 26 to
set aside reserves on a broader range of deposits, according to
a People’s Bank of China document obtained by Bloomberg News.  “The policy move shows that the PBOC is still concerned
with inflation,” said Liu Li-Gang, chief China economist at ANZ
Banking Group Ltd. in  Hong Kong .  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost to receive the
seven-day repurchase rate, rose 24 basis points this month to
4.41 percent as of 4:32 p.m. in  Shanghai . The rate, which
touched a record 4.52 percent yesterday, was down two basis
points today.  Inflation may exceed 7 percent in November, when selling of
the autumn grain harvest will begin, the China National Radio
cited Wang as saying. Consumer prices rose 6.5 percent in July,
the most in three years, official data showed this month.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding
availability, decreased 16 basis points this month, or 0.16
percentage point, to 4.94 percent in Shanghai, according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It surged 87 basis points this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
