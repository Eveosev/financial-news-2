Global trade cooled in the second
quarter, with growth in both exports and imports slowing in most
Group of Seven countries and major emerging markets, the
 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  said.  Goods export growth among the G-7 and the BRICS nations of
Brazil, Russia, India,  China  and  South Africa  slowed to 1.9
percent from 7.7 percent in the previous three months, the
Paris-based institution said in an e-mailed statement today.
Imports rose 1.1 percent, down from 10 percent.  The figures highlight the weakening in the global recovery
that has prompted Federal Reserve policy makers to debate ways
to invigorate the  U.S. economy . In the U.K., two officials who
had favored an interest-rate increase dropped their push for
higher borrowing costs this month.  Import and export growth slowed in all G-7 and BRICS
countries, apart from a surge in imports in  Brazil  and exports
from China, the OECD said.  While Chinese import growth plunged to 0.7 percent, the
slowest since the first quarter of 2009, from 11.1 percent,
exports surged 10 percent, up from 2.9 percent in the first
three months of the year. That led to a “sharp increase” in
the nation’s trade surplus, the OECD said.  U.S. import growth slowed to 3 percent versus 11.1 percent
and export growth cooled to 2.6 percent from 5.6 percent.  The G-7 countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
