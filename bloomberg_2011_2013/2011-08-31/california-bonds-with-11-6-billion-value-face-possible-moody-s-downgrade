About $11.6 billion in  California 
tax-allocation bonds are at risk of a downgrade, Moody’s
Investors Service said, due to “substantial uncertainty” over
the future of redevelopment agencies in the most-populous state.  Two new laws that divert money from California’s 400
redevelopment agencies and eliminate tracking of revenue used to
repay their bonds may diminish the credit quality of the debt,
Moody’s said yesterday. Governor  Jerry Brown  signed the laws as
part of a deal to balance California’s $86 billion budget for
2011-12 in June.  On Aug. 11, the California Supreme Court blocked the Brown
administration from diverting $1.7 billion from the agencies,
which provide tax incentives for development projects in areas
that are deemed blighted. Moody’s said the ongoing court
challenge is a “key contributor” to its decision to review the
tax-allocation bonds.  “The fact that a state supreme court ruling could
invalidate one, both, or neither of these bills, in whole or in
part, creates uncertainty that is negative for the credit
quality of all California tax allocation bonds,” Moody’s said.  Moody’s noted that the state’s top court isn’t scheduled to
rule until Jan. 15 on whether the Brown administration was
within its rights to redirect the redevelopment funds to public
schools. The firm said it may take longer than the normal 90
days to decide on any ratings changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
