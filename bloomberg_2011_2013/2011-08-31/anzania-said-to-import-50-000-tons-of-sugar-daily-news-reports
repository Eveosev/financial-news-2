The government of Tanzania issued
permits to import 50,000 metric tons of sugar to ease a shortage
in the country, the  Daily News  reported, citing Castor Raphael
Ligalama, the chairman of the Tanzania Sugar Board.  The country has a sugar deficit of 100,000 tons after
factories resumed production two weeks ago, following a
suspension in production six months ago, according to the
newspaper.  Countries in eastern Africa may need to import a further
100,000 tons of sugar in the 2010-11 crop year as a lack of rain
affects local crops, according to Togo-based lender Ecobank
Transnational Inc.  Members of the  East African Community , a regional
intergovernmental organisation which includes Kenya and
Tanzania, were expected to import 500,000 tons in the current
season, Edward George, soft commodities specialist at the bank,
said in a London interview on June 25. That may rise to 600,000
tons because of dry weather, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
