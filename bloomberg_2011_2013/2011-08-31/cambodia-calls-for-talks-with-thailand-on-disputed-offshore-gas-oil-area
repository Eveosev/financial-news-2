Cambodia  called for official talks
with Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to jointly develop
areas of the Gulf of  Thailand  that may be rich in oil and gas
after revealing it held secret meetings with her predecessor.  “Cambodia would welcome the resumption of open and
official negotiation on this issue and will pursue such a course
as soon as practicable,” the Cambodian National Petroleum
Authority said in a  statement  yesterday.  Talks on delineating 26,000 square kilometers in the Gulf
of Thailand stalled as battles between the neighbors since 2008
over temples on their land border killed more than two dozen
people. Ex-leader Abhisit Vejjajiva scrapped a 2001 deal that
established a framework for the talks after Cambodia appointed
 Thaksin Shinawatra , Yingluck’s brother, as an adviser.  Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Sok An held “secret
meetings” with Suthep Thaugsuban, Abhisit’s deputy, the past
two years on the disputed maritime territory, according to the
statement. Cambodia’s petroleum agency said Abhisit has been
“attempting to derail” negotiations with Yingluck’s
government, which took power earlier this month.  Suthep declined to comment when reached by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
