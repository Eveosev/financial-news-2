The Philippine peso was headed for a
third loss in four months and bonds were set to gain after
government reports signaled economic growth is losing momentum.  Gross domestic product expanded 3.4 percent last quarter,
less than the 4.1 percent median estimate a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Global funds sold $116 million more Philippine
stocks than they bought through Aug. 26, the first monthly net
sales since February, according to exchange data.  "Growth is coming in at a slightly lower rate and we expect
the government to keep a supportive policy,"  Jonathan Ravelas ,
chief market strategist at Banco de Oro Unibank Inc. in  Manila ,
said before the report was released. "We expect to see a
trading-range market given the recent run of risk aversion."  The peso depreciated 0.5 percent to 42.365 per  U.S. dollar 
since the end of July, trimming this quarter’s advance to 2.5
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
rose 0.1 percent from 42.428 on Aug. 26. Local financial markets
were shut on Aug. 29 and Aug. 30 for public holidays.  The Southeast Asian economy grew 4.9 percent in the first
three months this year. Other reports this month showed
Philippine exports slumped 10.2 percent in June and the
government’s budget deficit widened to 26.5 billion pesos ($626
million) in July from 7.69 billion pesos in June. Reports
yesterday showed consumer confidence in the U.S. and euro zone
fell to the lowest in more than two years.  China ,  South Korea , Taiwan, Thailand,  Hong Kong , Malaysia
and Singapore all reported economic growth for the second
quarter that was the slowest since 2009.  The yield on the 6.5 percent government bonds due April
2021 dropped 37 basis points this month, or 0.37 percentage
point, to 5.83 percent, according to prices from Tradition. The
rate was little changed from Aug. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
