Hermes International (RMS)  SCA, the French
maker of Kelly handbags and silk scarves, confirmed its targets
for 2011 after first-half profit surged 49 percent.  Net income climbed to 290.9 million euros ($420 million) in
the first six months from 194.6 million euros a year earlier,
Paris-based Hermes said in a statement today. Sales rose 22
percent to 1.31 billion euros.  Hermes raised its annual revenue target last month and said
the underlying operating margin will be close to the record
level of 2010 after second-quarter sales increased faster than
analysts estimated. The 174-year-old company bought back about 1
percent of its share capital in June and August as  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  boosted its stake to 21.4 percent in
the first six months of 2011.  “We currently forecast higher growth than group guidance,
given the remarkable achievement of the first half,” Pierre Lamelin, an analyst at CA Cheuvreux in Paris, wrote in a note
today.  Hermes rose 1.7 percent to 269.55 euros at 9:06 a.m. in
Paris trading, bringing the stock’s gain to 72 percent for the
year.  The company reiterated that it expects sales to rise
between 12 percent and 14 percent at constant exchange rates
this year. First-half operating profit rose 37 percent to 418
million euros.  Americas Demand  The first-half gains were fueled by demand in the Americas
and the sale of a stake in Jean-Paul Gaultier’s fashion label.
Operating profit as a percentage of sales widened to 32 percent
from 28.3 percent a year earlier. That was the highest level
recorded since the 1993 initial public offering, the company
said.  Growth will be slower in the second half than in the same
period of 2010 because the final six months of last year were so
strong, Chief Executive Officer  Patrick Thomas  said in a phone
interview in July. At the time, he also said he was concerned by
the international financial situation, warning that economic
instability could affect business in the rest of 2011.  Hermes is holding a presentation this morning in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
