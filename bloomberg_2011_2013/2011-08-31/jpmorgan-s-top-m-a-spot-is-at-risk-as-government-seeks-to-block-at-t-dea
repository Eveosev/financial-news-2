JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  stands to lose
its top spot among takeover advisers this year if  AT&T Inc. (T) 
isn’t able to complete its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA
Inc., the biggest deal of 2011.  A collapse would move  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  into the No.
1 ranking with $346.8 billion in deals this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan has $341.5 billion,
excluding the AT&T transaction, the data show.  AT&T said today it will “vigorously contest” the U.S.
government’s lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition of T-
Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom AG. If those efforts fail,
AT&T’s advisers, JPMorgan, Greenhill & Co. and  Evercore Partners
Inc. (EVR) , aren’t likely to get any significant fees for their work,
according to estimates by New York-based research firm Freeman &
Co.  Deutsche Telekom’s advisers,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and Citigroup Inc., may have to share
as little as $7 million to $9 million, or about one-tenth of an
original $70 million to $90 million in estimated fees, said Lam Nguyen, a Freeman vice president. It’s also possible, though
unlikely, that the Deutsche Telekom advisers could collect as
much as $60 million, or 1 percent of the estimated value of a $6
billion reverse breakup fee, Nguyen said.  JPMorgan, Greenhill and Evercore would get $60 million to
$80 million in fees only if AT&T is able to proceed with the
purchase, according to Nguyen. JPMorgan and other lenders are
still getting $20 million from committing to provide AT&T a $20
billion loan to finance the purchase, Nguyen said.  Spokesmen for the banks advising Dallas-based AT&T and
Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom declined to comment.  Greenhill Falls  Greenhill, which draws most of its revenue from providing
advice, fell 3.5 percent to $35.53 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading, the day’s worst performance in
the 75-company Standard and Poor’s Midcap Financials Index.
Evercore gained 1.6 percent to $26.23.  Goldman Sachs had been an adviser to Sprint Nextel Corp.,
which had been in talks to buy T-Mobile USA before AT&T agreed
to a takeover, people familiar with the matter said in March.
The New York-based bank held the top spot in global M&A advisory
every year from 2001 to 2008, Bloomberg data show.  Excluding transfers of government assets, the AT&T deal is
the largest takeover proposed anywhere in the world since BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company, offered $40
billion for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan last August. BHP’s bid
was blocked by the Canadian government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
