U.S. investors pulled $3.2 billion
from stock mutual funds in the week ended Aug. 24, according to
the  Investment Company Institute .  Customers withdrew $2.6 billion from funds that invest in
domestic equities and $610 million from funds that buy stocks
outside the U.S., the Washington-based trade group said today in
an e-mailed statement. Equity funds had assets of $5.84 trillion
at the end of July, ICI data show.  Investors added $295 million to funds that buy bonds and
$871 million to those that purchase both stocks and bonds in the
past week.  Equity funds attracted $1.69 billion in the week ended Aug.
17, breaking a streak of withdrawals that began in April and
peaked at $30 billion in the week ended Aug. 10. Stocks fell in
late July and the first three weeks of August amid an
unprecedented downgrade of U.S. credit by  Standard & Poorâ€™s  and
concerns that the economic recovery is faltering.  The last previous equity deposits came in the week ended
April 20, when $3.05 billion was invested, including $1.92
billion in domestic funds.  Domestic equity funds experienced $9 billion in redemptions
in the first six months of 2011 and may be headed for a record
fifth straight year of withdrawals, ICI data show. All stock
funds, including those that invest outside the U.S., gathered a
net $13.7 billion in deposits in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
