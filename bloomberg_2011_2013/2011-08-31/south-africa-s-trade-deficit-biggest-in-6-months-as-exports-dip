South Africa  posted a 3.9 billion-
rand ($555-million) trade deficit in July, the biggest in six
months, as metal exports declined and fuel imports rose.  The deficit compared with a surplus of 4.9 billion rand in
June, the Pretoria-based South African Revenue Service said in
an e-mailed statement today. The median estimate of eight
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 100 million-rand
surplus.  The turnaround in the  trade balance  “was mainly due to
lower precious metal exports and increased imports of crude oil,
vehicles, aircraft, machinery and electrical appliances,” the
revenue services said. “The cumulative trade deficit for the
year to date is 6.4 billion rand.”  Exports fell 6.7 percent percent to 56.5 billion rand in
July from the previous month as shipments of precious and semi-
precious stones and metals declined by 2.3 billion rand, or 14
percent, the revenue service said. Exports of chemical products
dropped 809 million rand, or 23 percent.  Imports rose 8.5 percent to 60.4 billion rand in the
period, with purchases of vehicles, aircraft and vessels jumping
1.88 billion rand, or 36 percent, and imports of machinery and
electrical appliances increasing 1.29 billion rand, or 10
percent, it said.  Four of the eight economists surveyed expected a  trade
surplus  after the price of gold climbed 7.9 percent last month
and the platinum price gained 3.8 percent. Those metals account
for about a fifth of South African exports, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Trade figures are often volatile, reflecting the timing of
shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
