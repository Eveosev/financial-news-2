Hungary ’s public debt will decline
by several percentage points within a week and its level may
fall to less than 70 percent of gross domestic product in 2012
from 77 percent this year, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said.  The government will use the proceeds from the sale of
pension-fund assets to cut public debt, Orban said in an
interview with public broadcaster MR1, according to a transcript
posted on the radio station’s website. The Cabinet will speed up
an overhaul of public services in response to the European
economic crisis, Orban told MR1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
