Belarus may let its currency devalue
by as much as 15 percent in September as the government attempts
to bring the ruble’s official exchange rate closer to black-
market levels, according to Medley Global Advisors LLC.  “The authorities are having a hard time meeting their
month-to-month commitments,” Kaan Nazli, director of emerging
markets at Medley in  New York , said by phone late yesterday.
“It’ll probably be a devaluation of 10 percent to 15 percent
that they’ll allow -- whether that’s as much as they need is a
different question.”  Belarus may stop “artificially” supporting the currency in
mid-September, Interfax reported yesterday, citing President
Aleksandr Lukashenko. Belarus allowed the managed ruble to drop
36 percent against the dollar in May.  The ruble, whose official central-bank  rate  is 5,107 per
dollar tomorrow, traded for as little as 9,000 on the streets,
according to  Barbara Nestor , an emerging-markets strategist at
Commerzbank AG, who recently returned from a research trip to
the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
