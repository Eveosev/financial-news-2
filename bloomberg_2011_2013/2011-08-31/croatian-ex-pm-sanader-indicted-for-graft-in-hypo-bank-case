Croatia  indicted former Prime
Minister Ivo Sanader for taking bribes from Austria’s Hypo Alpe-
Adria-Bank International AG in exchange for facilitating loans
to Croatia.  Sanader is accused of taking a bribe of 3.6 million kuna
($690,000) from the Austrian bank between 1994 to 1995, when he
was deputy foreign minister in the Croatian Democratic Union
government, the Prosecutor General said today in a statement on
its website.  In exchange, the Croatian government at the time took a
loan of 140 million Austrian schilling from Hypo bank, it said.  Sanader was elected prime minister in 2003 and 2007 and
left his post without explanation in July 2009. He is under
suspicion for corruption and abuse of power in several cases
involving state companies and Croatian refiner INA Industrija
Nafte d.d.  Sanader testified yesterday that he didn’t take a bribe
from Mol Nyrt. to give the Hungarian refiner control of
Croatia’s INA Industrija Nafte d.d..  He was arrested in  Austria  in December and extradited to
Croatia in July.  To contact the reporter on the story:
