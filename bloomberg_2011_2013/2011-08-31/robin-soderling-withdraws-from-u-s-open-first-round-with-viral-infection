Sixth-seeded Robin Soderling
withdrew from the U.S. Open before his first-round match today
because of a viral infection, the U.S. Tennis Association said.  Soderling, from  Sweden , pulled out of the match with Irish
qualifier Louk Sorensen. His place in the draw was taken by
Rogerio Dutra Da Silva of  Brazil .  Soderlingâ€™s best result in eight previous U.S. Opens
was a quarterfinal finish last year. He was also the runner-up
at the  French Open  in both 2009 and 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
