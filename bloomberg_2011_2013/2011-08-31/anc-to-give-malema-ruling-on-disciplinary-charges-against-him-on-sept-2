South Africa ’s ruling  African
National Congress  said its disciplinary committee will make a
ruling on an application by ANC Youth League President  Julius
Malema  to drop all charges against him at 9 a.m. in Johannesburg
on Sept. 2.  The disciplinary committee rejected an application from
Malema for the recusal of three members of its panel because he
didn’t provide enough facts to show that there may be bias
against him, the Johannesburg-based party said in an e-mailed
statement today. It didn’t name which members Malema wanted out.  On Aug. 19, Malema and spokesman Floyd Shivambu were
ordered to appear before a disciplinary panel after they called
for the overthrow of Botswana’s government. Shivambu’s hearing
has been postponed to a later date, the ANC said.  Malema will appear with another four ANCYL leaders on Sept.
2 on charges of “barging” into a meeting, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
