Etablissements Maurel & Prom SA, a
French oil explorer, reported a 76 percent increase in first-
half profit as production expanded in  Gabon  and  Nigeria .  Net profit rose to 90 million euros ($130 million), from 51
million euros, the Paris-based company said in a  statement .
Sales more than tripled to 253.6 million euros.  Production averaged 19,474 barrels of oil equivalent a day
and is expected to grow this half with two new wells in the Onal
permit in Gabon and a reopening of wells in Nigeria. Higher
prices also raised profit in the first six months, it said.  Output at the end of the year is likely to be about 28,000
barrels a day, with 20,000 barrels from Gabon and 8,000 from
Nigeria, according to Chief Executive Officer Jean-Francois Henin. The company is considering options for a sale of assets
in Tanzania following the disposal of a rig unit in  Venezuela 
and plans to spin off Nigerian operations, Henin said in June.  The CEO, who owns 24 percent of Maurel, said in April he
had failed to get a reasonable offer for the entire company,
which had also tried to list in  London .  Oil India Ltd., the nation’s second-biggest state-run oil
producer, is in talks to buy a stake in Maurel’s Gabon assets,
three people with knowledge of the matter said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
