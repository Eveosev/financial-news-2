Colombia  increased its  gold reserves 
by 2.3 metric tons in July and Kazakhstan,  Mexico  and Tajikistan
reduced holdings by a combined 4.5 tons as the price of the
metal rallied to a record.  Colombia’s bullion reserves rose to 9.16 tons last month,
according to data on the International Monetary Fund’s website.
Kazakhstan cut reserves by 3.11 tons to 67.3 tons in the period,
Tajikistan reduced holdings by 1.19 tons to 1.8 tons and
Mexico’s assets fell 0.175 tons to 105.7 tons, the data show.  Central banks are expanding their gold reserves for the
first time in a generation as purchases by billionaire investors
including  John Paulson  contributed to bullion extending its
longest annual winning streak since at least 1920. The metal
climbed to an all-time high of $1,913.50 an ounce on Aug. 23 in
London and has outperformed global equities, commodities and
Treasuries this year.  “Central banks will continue to diversify their
reserves,” said Filip Petersson, an analyst at SEB AB in
 Stockholm . The  Federal Reserve  “is obviously not closing the
door for more money printing and it is therefore attractive to
continue to diversify reserves. Central banks are looking for at
least one true safe haven.”  Colombia’s increase in reserves was the first since a 100-
ounce expansion in November 2007, the IMF data show.  Bullion Holdings  Bullion traded at $1,835.15 an ounce by 5:30 p.m. in
London and is up 29 percent this year. It’s heading for an 11th
straight annual gain. Holdings of the metal in exchange-traded
products climbed to a record 2,216.8 tons on Aug. 8 and were at
2,144.9 tons yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Russia ’s Bank Rossii said on Aug. 22 that the central bank
raised gold holdings to 27 million ounces (839.8 tons) in July
from 26.9 ounces at the end of June.  Central banks bought 192.3 tons of the metal in the first
half, the World Gold Council said earlier this month. That may
also be a warning. Prices rose to a then-record $850 in 1980 as
central banks bought gold, only to drop for most of the next 20
years. Bullion tripled from 1999 through the beginning of 2008
as the banks sold more than 4,000 tons.  Minutes of the Fed meeting on Aug. 9 showed policy makers
favored “more substantial” measures to boost the  U.S. economy 
than the current pledge to hold rates at a record low for the
next two years. The Fed bought $600 billion in Treasuries from
November through June.  Global holdings of gold by governments and official
institutions such as the IMF stood at 30,700.1 tons by this
month, according to the World Gold Council.  Bullion accounted for 1.1 percent of Colombia’s total
reserves, 3.8 percent of Mexico’s, 9.9 percent of Kazakhstan’s
and 7.7 percent of Russia’s, according to the latest  World Gold
Council  holdings report. The metal accounts for more than 70
percent of reserves of the U.S. and  Germany , the biggest
holders, the council’s data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
