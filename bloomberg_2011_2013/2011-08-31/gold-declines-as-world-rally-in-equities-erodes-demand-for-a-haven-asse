Gold fell for the second time in
three days as a rally in global equities eroded the appeal of
the precious metal as a haven asset.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose as much as 1.3
percent to the highest in almost four weeks, erasing its 2011
loss. The MSCI World Index rallied for a fourth straight
session. Gold is still headed for the biggest monthly gain since
November 2009 after touching an all-time high of $1,917.90 an
ounce on Aug. 23 in  New York .  “With stocks rallying, there’s just an excuse for
investors to take profits on gold,”  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $4.40, or 0.2
percent, to $1,825.40 at 10:24 a.m. on the Comex. A close at
that price would still leave the most-active contract up 11
percent this month and 28 percent this year.  Prices surged in August on mounting speculation that the
U.S. economic recovery will falter and the  Federal Reserve 
pledged to keep borrowing costs at a record low until mid-2013.
In August, gold also reached records in euros and British pounds
amid Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 7.1 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $41.535 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery dropped $2.10, or 0.1 percent, to $1,851 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery rose $2, or 0.3
percent, to $781.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
