Japan , the world’s third-largest oil
user, cut crude oil imports by 1.9 percent from a year earlier
in July as industrial production grew at a slower pace than
expected by economists.  Crude imports dropped to 17.3 million kiloliters in July,
or about 3.5 million barrels a day, according to data released
today by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.  Japan’s industrial production climbed 0.3 percent in July
from June, missing the 1.4 percent increase expected by 28
economists in a survey by Bloomberg. The economy has contracted
for three straight quarters and a surge in the yen has damped
demand for the country’s cars and durable goods.  Saudi Arabia  supplied the most crude to Japan last month,
contributing 33.6 percent of overall imports, the data showed.
Imports from the world’s biggest exporter were up 36.5 percent.
Supplies from  Iran  fell 34.4 percent.  Imports of crude from Southeast Asia more than doubled in
July as Vietnam’s exports to Japan increased 46 percent,
according to the data. The country has purchased more of the
country’s heavy, low-sulfur oil to burn in  power plants  after
the March 11 earthquake shut nuclear facilities.  Oil products, including gasoline and diesel, brought into
Japan rose 4.5 percent to 3.065 million kiloliters compared with
July 2010, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
