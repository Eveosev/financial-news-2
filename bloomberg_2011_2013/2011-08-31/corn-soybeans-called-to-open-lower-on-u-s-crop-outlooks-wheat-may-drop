What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that warm,
dry weather in the U.S. Midwest during the next two weeks will
accelerate plant maturity and allow for early harvesting in some
southern regions,  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president for
the Linn Group in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that accelerated harvesting of this
yearâ€™s crop in the U.S. will lead to increased sales by farmers,
Huckabay said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open down 0.1
cent to 0.2 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may open 50
cents to $1 lower per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that deliveries against the
September futures contracts in Chicago and Kansas City indicate
slowing demand, after prices rose to three-month highs this
week, Huckabay said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
