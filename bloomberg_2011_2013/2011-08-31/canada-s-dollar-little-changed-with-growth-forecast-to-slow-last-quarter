Canada ’s dollar declined for the
first month since May versus its U.S. counterpart on speculation
that a slowdown in America, the nation’s biggest trade partner,
will crimp exports.  The currency was little changed today versus the greenback
and dropped against the majority of its 16 most-traded peers,
falling the most against the Swiss franc and the Mexican peso. A
report showed the Canadian economy unexpectedly shrank in the
second quarter.  “A lot of the weakness in the Canadian dollar is linked to
what we’re seeing on the U.S. data front,” said  Mary Nicola , a
currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA, by phone from New York.
“If the U.S. is going to slow down, it’s going to have an
impact on Canada. The Canada dollar seems to be the laggard.”  The Canadian currency traded at 97.77 cents per  U.S. dollar 
at 5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with 97.79 cents yesterday. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0228. The loonie, as the currency is
nicknamed, dropped 2.3 percent this month.  Canada’s economy shrank at a 0.4 percent annualized pace
during the April-June period following a 3.6 percent gain in the
first three months of the year,  Statistics Canada  said. It was
the first quarterly contraction since the recession two years
ago, as a strong loonie boosted imports and curbed exports.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast no growth in the
quarter, based on the median of 23 responses. The economy grew
by 0.2 percent in June, compared with a median forecast in a
survey for 0.1 percent expansion. Currencies of countries such
as Canada, where natural resources account for more than half of
export revenue, tend to rally on economic optimism.  ‘Some Solace’  “Maybe some solace will be taken on the back of the
monthly data,” said  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign
exchange at  National Bank of Canada , by phone from Toronto.
“The Canadian dollar is likely to lag on the crosses,” he
said, referring to trades that don’t involve the U.S. dollar.  Government bonds  fell, pushing yields on Canada’s benchmark
10-year note up nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to
2.49 percent. The price of the 3.25 percent security due in June
2021 fell 80 cents to C$106.55.  Canada sold C$400 million ($409 million) of real-return
bonds, drawing a median yield of 0.837 percent. The government
received bids of C$1.04 billion for the 1.5 percent, inflation-
linked securities due in December 2044, according to a statement
today on the Bank of Canada’s website.  U.S. Employment  Companies in the U.S. added 91,000 workers to payrolls in
August, according a report from ADP Employer Services. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called
for an advance of 100,000. U.S. nonfarm payroll growth slowed to
70,000 jobs in August, from 117,000 in July, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey before the government
reports the data on Sept. 2.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ended the day up 0.5
percent after rising as much as 1.5 percent and falling 0.3
percent. Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, dropped
as much as 1.4 percent before trading little changed at $88.85 a
barrel in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
