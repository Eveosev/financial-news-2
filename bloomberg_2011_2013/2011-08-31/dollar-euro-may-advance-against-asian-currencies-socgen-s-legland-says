“two very weak currencies,” the dollar and euro, will
appreciate against emerging-market counterparts as Asian
economies begin to slow, according to Patrick Legland, global
head of research for  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA.  “We may have a new direction for currencies and the euro
and dollar against emerging-market currencies,” Legland said in
an interview at Bloomberg News’ headquarters in New York. “It’s
something we want our clients to heed because we think there is
money to make.”  Currencies that may see heightened weakness against the
greenback and 17-nation euro include the Indian rupee and Thai
bhat. SocGen advised clients to play the trade in baskets of
emerging-market currencies such as  Asia , excluding  Japan ,
according to Legland.  During the first half of the year “we saw most emerging
markets having to cope with inflation and they either raised
interest rates or limited currency appreciation,” he said.
“We’re starting to see some emerging markets talk about cutting
 interest rates  and it’s obviously a very powerful signal.”  The dollar has gained against 13 of 18 emerging market
counterparts during August after weakening against the majority
in the first seven months of the year, according to Bloomberg
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
