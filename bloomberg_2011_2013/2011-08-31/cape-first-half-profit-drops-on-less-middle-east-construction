Cape Plc (CIU) , which supplies fire-
protection, scaffolding and cleaners to energy companies such as
Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, said first-half profit dropped 11
percent as revenue from construction in the Middle East fell.  Net income declined to 21 million pounds ($34 million), or
17.2 pence per share, from 23.5 million pounds, or 19.6 pence
per share, a year earlier, the company said today in a
regulatory statement. Sales rose to 335 million pounds from 331
million pounds.  “We enjoy excellent visibility of contract pipelines and
we see momentum building,” Chief Executive Officer Martin May
said in the statement. “We confidently expect a return to
revenue growth in line with our double digit target range in the
second half.”  Revenue from the Gulf and  Middle East  region declined 17.5
percent to 66.1 million pounds. Revenue from construction
support services in the area declined to 42.8 million pounds
from 58.5 million pounds. The Gulf and Middle East contributed
20 percent of Cape’s revenue in the period.  Cape declined 16.75 pence, or 3.4 percent, to 470 pence at
8:25 a.m. in  London , giving the company a market value of 549
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
