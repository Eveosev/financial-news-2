Corn fell for the first time in five
sessions on speculation that demand will slow for grain used in
 animal feed , fuel and food after prices rose last week. Soybeans
and wheat were little changed.  Corn touched an 11-week high on Aug. 29 on signs that hot,
dry weather in the U.S. will cut crop yields. The  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  reported on Aug. 29 that the amount of
U.S. corn inspected for export in the week ended Aug. 25 dropped
15 percent from a week earlier.  “The past two weeks or so, traders have been pricing in
lower yields, so it’s no big surprise,” Frank Cholly Sr., a
senior market strategist at MF Global Holdings Inc., said by
telephone from Chicago. “There’s time now for the markets to
ration demand, and I think it does happen at these levels.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 7.75 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $7.675 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade. On Aug. 29, the grain touched $7.79, the
highest for the most-active contract since June 9. The price is
up 15 percent this month.  Soybean futures for November delivery advanced 0.5 cent to
$14.575 a bushel in Chicago, after touching $14.65, the highest
for the most-active contract since July 2008. The price is up
7.4 percent this month.  Wheat futures for December delivery gained 0.75 cent to
$7.915 a bushel in Chicago. On Aug. 29, the price climbed to
$8.055, the highest for a most-active contract since May 31. The
grain is up 11 percent this month.  Soybeans, which mature later than corn, still may face more
damage from dry weather in the Midwest, said  Dale Durchholz , a
senior market analyst at AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,  Illinois .
Drought in the Great Plains also may cut winter-wheat planting
in the next two months, he said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, USDA data show. Soybeans ranks second at $38.9 billion,
and wheat is fourth at $13 billion, after hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
