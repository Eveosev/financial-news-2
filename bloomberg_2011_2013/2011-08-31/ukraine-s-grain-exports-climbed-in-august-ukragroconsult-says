Ukraine’s grain exports increased in
the first 27 days of this month to 962,800 metric tons,

the Kiev-based researcher said today in e-mailed statement,
without giving a reason.  August shipments included 511,600 tons of barley, which
went mostly to  Saudi Arabia  and  Israel , according to the report.
Wheat was shipped to the European Union and Syria and accounted
for 437,400 tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
