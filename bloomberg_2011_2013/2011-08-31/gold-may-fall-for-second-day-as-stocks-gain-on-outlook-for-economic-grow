Gold declined for a second day as a
rally in global equities trimmed investor demand for haven
investments amid speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve may step
up measures to stimulate growth.  Immediate-delivery gold fell as much as 0.5 percent to
$1,817.22 an ounce, and traded at $1,818.10 by 2:19 p.m.
Singapore time. The metal, which reached a record $1,913.50 on
Aug. 23, climbed 12 percent in August, its best monthly
performance since November 2009. December delivery bullion in
 New York  shed as much as 0.7 percent to $1,819.40 an ounce,
before trading at $1,820.60.  Asian stocks extended a global advance after reports
yesterday showed U.S. business activity and factory orders
expanded at a faster pace than economists forecast. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  erased its 2011 losses as minutes
released Aug. 30 from the Fed’s meeting in August showed some
policy makers wanted to take more action to shore up the
economy.  “A rally in equity markets as risk appetite improved
weakened safe-haven bids for gold,” Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. analysts including  Mark Pervan  wrote in an e-
mail today.  The amount of gold held by exchange-traded products
declined for the eighth time in nine days to 2,144.457 metric
tons yesterday, after touching a record 2,216.756 tons on Aug.
8, Bloomberg data show.  Still, if the Fed takes more steps to address sluggish
economic conditions, “longer-term U.S. dollar weakness would be
likely to lend eventual support to gold and limit near-term
losses,” James Steel, an analyst at HSBC Securities USA Inc.,
wrote in a note to clients. The dollar gained for a third day
against a six-currency basket.  Central Banks  Colombia  increased its gold reserves by 2.3 tons in July,
while Kazakhstan, Mexico and Tajikistan reduced holdings by a
combined 4.5 tons in the period, according to data on the
International Monetary Fund’s website. Colombia joins  Thailand 
and  South Korea  in adding bullion to reserves this year.  “With sales from the CBGA nations still non-existent, we
are expecting further net central-bank purchases over the rest
of the year as Far Eastern banks in particular look to diversify
their dollar holdings,” said Societe Generale analyst David Wilson, referring to the Central Bank Gold Agreement.  The  European Central Bank  and 18 other central banks in
 Europe  agreed in August 2009 to sell no more than a combined 400
tons of gold a year through September 2014, marking a third
five-year cap. In the second quarter of 2011, central bank and
government-institution buying rose almost fivefold to 69.4 tons,
taking the first-half total to 192.3 tons, according to the
World Gold Council.  Spot silver dropped 0.4 percent to $41.3775 an ounce, while
cash platinum rose 0.4 percent to $1,852.50 an ounce and
palladium climbed 0.3 percent to $787.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
