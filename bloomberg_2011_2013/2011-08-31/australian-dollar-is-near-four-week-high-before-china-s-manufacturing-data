The Australian currency strengthened
for a sixth day against the yen, the longest winning streak
since April, and bond yields increased after a report showed
retail sales rose more than economists forecast.  The South Pacific currency reached its strongest level in
four weeks versus the  U.S. dollar  as traders lowered bets on
interest-rate cuts by the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia . New
Zealand’s currency, called the kiwi, fell for the first time in
five days against the greenback after a private report showed
prices for the nation’s commodities declined last month.  The Aussie is supported as “the market moves to price in a
sensible track for the RBA,” said  Matthew Johnson , a strategist
at UBS AG in Sydney. “This data will push yields higher because
it reminds the market that what’s priced in is unrealistic.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.7 percent to 82.66 yen at 12:47
p.m. in  New York , from 82.08 yen yesterday. It reached 82.83,
the strongest since Aug. 5. It gained 0.5 percent to $1.0759,
from $1.0707, and touched $1.0765, the strongest since Aug. 4.  New Zealand ’s currency was little changed at 65.49 yen,
from 65.48 yen. The kiwi slid 0.2 percent to 85.22 U.S. cents.  Yields on the two-year Australian note rose eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.83 percent and touched
3.89 percent, the highest level since Aug. 5.  Retail sales in Australia advanced 0.5 percent in July, the
first gain in three months, data from the Bureau of Statistics
showed today. Separate figures from the bureau showed business
investment rose 4.9 percent in the second quarter from the
previous three months.  Rate Cuts  A Credit Suisse Group AG index based on swaps trading
showed traders are betting the RBA’s benchmark 4.75 percent
target rate will be cut by 111 basis points over 12 months. That
compares with reductions of 123 basis points projected yesterday
and 154 points estimated on Aug. 22.  RBA Governor Glenn Stevens has kept the rate unchanged for
eight policy meetings to gauge the economic fallout from
 Europe ’s debt crisis. Policy makers meet next on Sept. 6.  The kiwi declined after a report showed that the value of
New Zealand’s commodity prices fell for a third month and as a
Chinese manufacturing index stayed near the borderline between
expansion and contraction in August.  The ANZ Commodity Price Index dropped 1.2 percent in August
from July, when it declined a revised 0.2 percent, according to
data released today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
