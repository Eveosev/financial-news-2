South Africa  may struggle to meet
its target of redistributing 30 percent of agricultural land by
2014,  Rural Development  and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti
said.  “These targets are very slippery,” Nkwinti told reporters
in  Cape Town  today. South Africa may not be able to raise
sufficient funds for the program, which may cost more than 40
billion rand by 2014, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
