The  Ghana  Cocoa Board, which markets
the commodity in the West African country, intends to borrow
$250 million more than planned in a trade-finance loan on
expectations that next season’s crop will be larger than
estimated, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Yaw Adu-Ampomah said.  “We will ask the banks to make provision for $2 billion
although we will actually need $1.75 billion if we have any
emergencies,” he said in a telephone interview from the
capital, Accra, yesterday. The loan applies to the 2011-12
season, which runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30, 2012.  Ghana, the world’s second-largest cocoa producer after
neighboring  Ivory Coast , borrows funds every year to ensure
supply is available for international buyers. The board has 13
lenders including Ghana International Bank arranging the loan
and will pay an initial interest of 65 basis points more than
the  London  interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with 90 basis points above Libor on a
$1.5 billion loan that expires on Sept. 22.  The nation, which expects output to exceed 1 million metric
tons of the beans by the close of the 2010-11 season, aims to
produce 1.1 million tons in 2011-12 through increased yields,
board Chief Executive Officer Kwabena Asante-Poku said on Aug.
25.  The country intends to maintain production between 1
million tons to 1.2 million tons in the coming seasons, Adu-
Ampomah said.  “We project that from the 2012/2013 season, subsidized
fertilizer usage by farmers will cover 50 percent of all
farms,” he said. Spraying of pesticides in preparation for the
next season started in early August and will continue in all
farms till December, Adu-Ampomah said.  Cocoa for December delivery headed for the highest close in
more than a week on NYSE Liffe, adding 5 pounds, or 0.3 percent,
to 1,954 pounds by 10:10 a.m. in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
