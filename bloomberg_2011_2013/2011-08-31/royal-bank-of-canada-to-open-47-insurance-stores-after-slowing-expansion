Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s
largest lender by assets, is working to add 47 more insurance
branches after spending two years focusing on improving service
at existing offices, the bank’s head of insurance said.  “We’re going to continue to build on our retail
platform,” RBC Insurance Chief Executive Officer Neil Skelding
said yesterday in an interview. “Our retail strategy has worked
very well, and we’ll continue to pursue that.”  Royal Bank, which has 53 insurance stores in five
provinces, opened 10 offices in the past two years, compared
with 43 between 2005 and 2009. The bank slowed expansion toward
its goal of 100 offices to work on sales and distribution
strategies that improve service, Skelding said.  Ontario and  Quebec  will receive most of the new branches,
Skelding said, and some could be added in  Alberta  and the
Maritime provinces. RBC Insurance has 37 offices in Ontario,
seven in Alberta, four in Quebec, three in  New Brunswick  and two
in Nova Scotia.  Royal Bank opened its first insurance office near a Toronto
bank branch in June 2005 to work around Canadian regulations
that prohibit lenders from selling property, casualty and life
insurance from bank branches.  RBC Insurance posted profit of C$435 million ($445 million)
in the first three quarters of this year, up from C$378 million
in the same period last year. It had profit of C$496 million in
fiscal 2009, its best year.  “There’s still a lot of room to grow,” Skelding said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
