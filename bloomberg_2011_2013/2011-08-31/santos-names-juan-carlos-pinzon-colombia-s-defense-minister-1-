Colombia ’s President Juan Manuel Santos today replaced his defense minister with Juan Carlos Pinzon amid an increase in guerrilla attacks and massacres.  Pinzon, a deputy defense minister under Santos in the
previous administration of President Alvaro Uribe, will replace
Rodrigo Rivera, according to a  statement  today from the
president’s office. Pinzon, who studied at Harvard University,
most recently was secretary-general at the president’s office.  “Perhaps no one exists who is better prepared and more
capable to be defense minister at this moment,” Santos said in
the statement. “He was born and raised in the barracks, the son
of a military man, married to a military daughter and possibly
knows our armed forces better than anyone.”  Rivera, who Santos named ambassador to  Belgium , resigned to
“explore new opportunities of service to my country,” he said
in an e-mailed  statement  from the defense ministry.  Rivera oversaw the 2010 operation that led to the killing
of Mono Jojoy, the military chief of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the country’s biggest guerrilla group.
Rivera acknowledged that even as the rate of murder and
kidnappings has improved, there has been an increase in
massacres and terrorism since he took office, according to the
statement.  As deputy defense minister, Pinzon also helped orchestrate
the rescue of 15 rebel-held hostages, including French-Colombian
politician  Ingrid Betancourt , and an air strike into Ecuador
that killed Raul Reyes, another top rebel commander.  Pinzon has also worked at the  World Bank  and at Citigroup
Inc., the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
