Actividades de Construccion y
Servicios SA expects foreign sales to account for more than half
of the total this year after taking over  Germany ’s  Hochtief AG (HOT) ,
General Manager Angel Garcia Altozano said.  “By the end of the year I think the international sales of
our group will be more than 70 percent of total sales, and in
the coming year that will probably increase to over 75 percent
or thereabouts,” Garcia Altozano said in an interview today
with Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television’s “On the Move.”  ACS,  Spain ’s largest construction company, reported a 21
percent increase in first-half profit yesterday as international
sales more than doubled. Net income rose to 604 million euros
($871 million), as revenue gained 26 percent to 9.47 billion
euros. Foreign sales amounted to 53 percent of the total.  Garcia Altozano said the company, which had net debt of
9.85 billion euros at the end of the quarter, doesn’t have any
“major concern” regarding financing. It has refinanced 5
billion euros in the last six months, pushing the maturities to
2014 and beyond, he said.  “We do not see major pressure, we have no short-term
immediate refinancing needs and we have a very ample plan to
keep on renewing our refinancing,” he said.  ACS rose as much as 77 cents, or 2.8 percent, to 28.52
euros in  Madrid , and traded at 28.5 euros as of 10:25 a.m.,
valuing the company at 8.97 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
