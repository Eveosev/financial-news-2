A U.S. judge reaffirmed his ruling
to take jurisdiction over two suits by  Parmalat SpA (PLT)  against
accounting firm  Grant Thornton  LLP, which he later dismissed.  U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan  in Manhattan today ruled
that he was correct in taking the two cases, which were
originally filed by Parmalat and its Parmalat Capital Finance
Ltd. unit in Illinois state court in 2004 and 2005. Kaplan
dismissed the suits in 2009.  In January, a federal appeals court in Manhattan revived
the cases, ruling that Kaplan had applied the wrong standard in
determining whether to exercise jurisdiction.  The appeals court sent the cases back to Kaplan to
determine whether federal law required him to abstain from
taking them in favor of the Illinois courts. Kaplan, applying
the rule set by the appeals court, said today that he was
entitled to rule in the cases.  Parmalat, a dairy company based in Collecchio,  Italy ,
collapsed in December 2003 in the country’s largest bankruptcy,
later disclosing more than 14 billion euros ($20.1 billion) of
debt, about eight times the amount reported by its former
management. Parmalat SpA emerged from bankruptcy and returned to
the stock market in 2005.  Enrico Bondi, who was appointed to oversee the Parmalat
bankruptcy, sued Grant Thornton, claiming it aided in the fraud
that led to Parmalat’s collapse. Parmalat Capital also sued the
firm.  The case is In re Parmalat Securities Litigation, 04-cv-
1653, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
