Copper swung between gains and
losses, heading for the biggest monthly drop since May 2010 as
worsening U.S.  consumer confidence  stoked concern that growth
may stall. Tin was set for the largest loss since October 2008.  Three-month delivery copper on the  London  Metal Exchange
lost as much as 0.5 percent to $9,114 a metric ton before
trading at $9,202.50 at 3:33 p.m.  Singapore  time. The price
touched $9,225 yesterday, the highest since Aug. 5. The metal
has fallen 6.5 percent this month, the first such decline in
three months.  The Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence in the
U.S., the world’s second-largest copper user, slumped to 44.5,
the weakest since April 2009. It was the biggest point drop
since October 2008, falling from a revised 59.2 reading in July,
figures from the New York-based research group showed yesterday.
A separate report showed  home prices  declined for a ninth month.  The market is under downward pressure from “concern over
European sovereign debt and U.S. growth and unemployment,” Nick Trevethan, senior commodities strategist at Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said today by phone from Singapore.  A further drop in price would be limited as supplies are
likely to decline with an 18 percent drop in Chilean output and
a potential strike at  Indonesia ’s Grasberg mine, he said.  Japan  Output  Industrial production in Japan rose less than expected in
July, signaling that the nation’s recovery from the March 11
earthquake and tsunami is losing momentum as the yen gains and
overseas demand slows. In  South Korea , industrial output
expanded at the slowest pace in 10 months as weakness in global
growth threatens the outlook for exports.  Factory output in Japan, the world’s third-largest economy,
increased 0.6 percent in July from June, the slowest gain since
March, the Trade Ministry said in  Tokyo  today. The median
estimate of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a
1.4 percent gain after a 3.8 percent increase in June.  Copper for November delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 68,190 yuan ($10,670) a ton.  Aluminum in London advanced 0.4 percent to $2,435.25 a ton.
Still, the metal has slumped 7.2 percent this month, the biggest
fall since May 2010. Zinc gained 0.2 percent to $2,290 a ton.
Lead rose 0.4 percent to $2,568 a ton, after dropping as much as
1.6 percent.  Nickel added 0.2 percent to $21,950 a ton after dropping as
much as 0.7 percent and tin jumped 1 percent to $24,250 a ton.
Tin has slumped 14 percent this month, the biggest loss since
October 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
