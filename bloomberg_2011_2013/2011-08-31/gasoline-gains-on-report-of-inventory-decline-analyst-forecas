Gasoline futures advanced after the
Energy Department reported inventories of the motor fuel fell to
the lowest level since May as drivers filled their tanks before
Hurricane Irene.  Futures rose 1.2 percent as gasoline stockpiles fell 2.8
million barrels to 208.6 million last week. Imports to the U.S.
East Coast declined 28 percent to 591,000 barrels a day during
the week ended Aug. 26 as Hurricane Irene approached the region,
department data showed.  “There must’ve been a rush to inventories in advance of
the hurricane,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy
Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “In the
last couple weeks, I’ve seen refiners being careful not to flood
the market. They were supplying just enough gasoline to meet
demand.”  Gasoline for September delivery rose 3.62 cents to settle
at $3.032 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
fell 2.6 percent this month and are up 24 percent in 2011.  The more actively traded October futures gained 3.48 cents
to $2.8763. September Nymex gasoline and heating oil futures
expired at the end of floor trading today.  Analysts estimated the government report would show a
decline of 1.1 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Demand jumped 2.4 percent from a week earlier to 9.23 million
barrels a day before the storm.  API Report  Futures were up earlier after the  American Petroleum
Institute  said yesterday that gasoline stocks fell 3.11 million
barrels last week to 210.8 million. Stockpiles of heating oil
and diesel increased 276,000 barrels to 153.1 million barrels,
according to the API report.  Distillate supplies gained 363,000 barrels to 156.1 million
barrels, according to the Energy Department.  Heating oil for September delivery rose 0.9 cent to $3.0782
a gallon. October delivery increased 0.73 cent to $3.0840.
Prices have gained 21 percent this year and dropped 0.6 percent
in August.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.5
cent to $3.617 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. It’s
the ninth consecutive price increase for the fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
