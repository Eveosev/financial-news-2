U.K. stocks climbed for a third day,
pushing the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  to a four-week high, as U.S.
manufacturing and jobs data topped forecasts.  Hargreaves Lansdown Plc (HL/) , the U.K.’s biggest retail broker,
surged 18 percent as customers and profit increased.  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  rallied following a
report that the U.K. will probably delay any overhaul of its
lenders until at least 2015.  The FTSE 100 advanced 24.12, or 0.5 percent, to 5,418.65 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge slumped 7.2 percent in
August, its biggest monthly drop since February 2009, as concern
that the global economic recovery is faltering wiped more than
$300 billion off the value of U.K. shares. The FTSE All-Share
Index added 0.2 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose
0.8 percent.  “The move into positive territory was largely due to some
better-than-expected manufacturing data from the U.S. which
helped lift stocks across the pond and this pulled the London
market with it,” said  Angus Campbell , the head of sales at
Capital Spreads in London. “Even though the economic data
released today is nothing to write home about and still shows
manufacturing in a sorry state, it’s a relief for investors to
see some light at the end of the tunnel.”  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
fell to 50.6 in August from 50.9 in July, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said today. Economists had projected the gauge would
drop to 48.5, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between
expansion and contraction in manufacturing.  U.S. Jobless Claims  A Labor Department report today showed U.S. initial jobless
claims fell to 409,000 last week, compared with the 410,000
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 46 economists’ estimates and
down from a revised 421,000 the week before.  Hargreaves Lansdown jumped 18 percent to 508.5 pence, its
biggest gain since May 2007. The broker reported a 50 percent
increase in full-year net income to 91.8 million pounds ($149
million) and raised its dividend by 59 percent.  Barclays advanced 5.6 percent to 180.35 pence, RBS surged
8.2 percent to 26.25 pence and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  jumped
6.2 percent to 35.67 pence. The U.K. government will probably
delay any overhaul of banks until after the next general
election, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified
government officials.  “Stricter regulation and banking reform has been a dark
cloud that has been hanging over the major U.K. banks for much
of the year, with investors fearing it may handicap banks from
being able to report the size of profits that shareholders were
used to before the financial crisis,” said Joshua Raymond, a
market strategist at City Index Ltd. in London.  Charter, Hays  Charter International Plc (CHTR)  rallied 4.7 percent to 799 pence.
The welding and automation-equipment maker opened its books to
Melrose Plc after the U.K. investment firm increased a possible
takeover offer to 1.43 billion pounds.  Hays Plc (HAS) , the U.K.’s biggest recruitment company, gained
6.7 percent to 80.55 pence. The company reported a 21 percent
increase in sales in the year ended June 30 to 3.26 billion
pounds, driven by growth in  Asia . Net income grew eightfold to
80.1 million pounds, reflecting previous charges for back-office
job cuts and a reduced price-fixing fine.  Xstrata Plc fell 2.5 percent to 1,052 pence. Fresnillo
decreased Plc 3.7 percent to 2,022 pence.  Copper declined for the first time in seven days in London
trading amid concern that  China ’s plan to tame inflation even as
the economy slows may hurt demand for metals. Zinc and lead also
fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
