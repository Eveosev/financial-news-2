Jindal Power Ltd., controlled by
Indian billionaire Savitri Jindal, plans to buy thermal plants
to accelerate the company’s plan to more than double its
generation capacity in the South Asian nation.  The company is seeking to acquire plants with capacity to
produce at least 1,000 megawatt of electricity, it said in an
 advertisement  in the Times of  India  today. Jindal Power is open
to buying generators under construction that have assured coal
supply, according to the advertisement.  The unit of  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP)  is among power
producers rushing to add capacity to help reduce blackouts and
sustain expansion in world’s second-fastest growing major
economy. Jindal Power can currently generate 1,000 megawatts and
is building 6,500 megawatts of coal-fired capacity.  “If you start from scratch, it will take a lot of time”
to increase capacity, Deputy Managing Director Sushil K. Maroo,
said in a telephone interview today. “That’s the reason we’re
looking at outright purchases.”  Building a 1,000 megawatt project costs 50 billion rupees
($1.1 billion), Maroo said, without disclosing the amount the
company plans to spend on acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
