Uganda ’s annual inflation rate
climbed to the highest level in more than 18 years in August as
food and fuel costs climbed.  Inflation accelerated to 21.4 percent, the fastest pace of
increase in prices since February 1993, from a revised 18.8
percent in July, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said in a
statement distributed today in Kampala, the capital. Prices rose
2.7 percent in the month.  “The main inflation-driver remained food,” which accounts
for 27 percent of the consumer price basket, it said. “Food
inflation is now 42.9 percent for the year ending August 2011
from 40.7 percent for the year ended-July 2011.”  Uganda’s central bank raised its benchmark  interest rate  by
1 percentage point to 14 percent on Aug. 2, a month after
introducing the lending rate, as rising food costs due to
drought and higher  oil prices  boosted inflation in East  Africa ’s
third-biggest economy. Uganda’s shilling is Africa’s worst-
performing currency this year after weakening 18 percent against
the dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency weakened 0.5 percent to 2,823 per dollar by 1 p.m. in
Kampala.  The central bank plans to start inflation-targeting in the
fiscal year through June 2012, aiming for annual price growth of
7 percent in the first three years of the program.  Uganda is Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer after
 Ethiopia , and it is on a cusp of an oil boom following finds by
U.K.’s Tullow Oil Plc and its partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
