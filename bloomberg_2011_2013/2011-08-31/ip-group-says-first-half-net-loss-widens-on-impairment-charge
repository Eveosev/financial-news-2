IP Group Plc (IPO) , a U.K. developer of
renewable energy, medical and chemicals businesses using
university research, posted a wider first-half loss as it took a
3 million-pound ($4.9 million) charge.  The net loss for the six months to June 30 swelled to 4.1
million pounds from 3.8 million pounds a year earlier, the
London-based company said today in a statement distributed by
the Regulatory News Service. Net assets rose 33 percent to 222.6
million pounds.  IP Group took an impairment charge relating to
consideration paid to the University of Oxford. The company
raised 55 million pounds from a placing and open offer in June
to strengthen its balance sheet and increase investment in
start-ups.  “We continue to believe that innovation has never been of
such importance to the U.K. economy and that the group will play
an increasingly central role in helping U.K. innovation reach
the market,” Chief Executive Alan Aubrey said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
