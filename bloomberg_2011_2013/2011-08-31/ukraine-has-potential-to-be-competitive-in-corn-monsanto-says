Ukraine, once the world’s largest
barley exporter, has the potential to be a “competitive” corn
supplier, said Gerald A. Steiner, executive vice president of
 Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s biggest seed producer.  “If you look at soil, climate conditions, Ukraine is very
well set up to be a competitive corn supplier and help meet
growing global demand,” Steiner told reporters today in Kiev.  St. Louis-based Monsanto sees most growth potential in
Ukraine’s production and exports of corn and rapeseed, he said.
Monsanto is focusing on selling conventional, non-genetically
modified seeds in Ukraine, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
