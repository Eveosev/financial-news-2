U.K. office developers led by  Great
Portland Estates Plc (GPOR)  declined in  London  trading after Morgan
Stanley cut its ratings for the companies.  Great Portland fell as much as 5.5 percent to 331.40 pence,
the lowest since Dec. 1, 2010.  Derwent London Plc (DLN)  dropped as
much as 4.1 percent, while British Land Co. declined 3.5 percent
and  Land Securities Group Plc (LAND)  lost 2.5 percent.  Land Securities, the country’s largest real estate
investment trust by market value, and British Land were
downgraded to “underweight” from “overweight,” Morgan
Stanley said in a note to investors today. Great Portland, which
focuses on office space in London’s West End, and Derwent London
were cut to “equal-weight” from “overweight.”  “What is significantly negative in our view is that most
of the main U.K. REITs have sizeable development pipelines, most
of which is committed and speculative,” a team at Morgan
Stanley wrote in a note to investors today. “We think the
likelihood of leasing up some of these schemes is declining.”  In July, U.K. commercial real-estate values rose at the
slowest pace since the market started recovering from a slump
two years ago. All the developers except British Land were
downgraded by Bank of America Corp. Global Research earlier this
month.  Land Securities was up 8.5 pence at 736.5 pence and Great
Portland rose 6 pence to 361.6 pence as of the 4:30 p.m. close
of London trading. British Land fell 5 pence to 539 pence and
Derwent London declined 3 pence to 1,547 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
