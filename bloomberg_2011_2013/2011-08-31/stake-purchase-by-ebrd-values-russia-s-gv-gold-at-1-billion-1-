The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development bought 5.26 percent of OAO Vysochaishy, a
Russian gold producer known as GV Gold, for 1.53 billion rubles
($53 million), valuing the company at about $1 billion.  Raiffeisen Bank International AG acted as the financial
adviser on the deal, GV Gold said in a statement today.  The producer increased gold output 37 percent in the first
half to 1.87 metric tons (60,660 ounces) from a year earlier, GV
Gold said by e-mail. It will use the proceeds for expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
