U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
rose by the seasonal average last week as normal temperatures in
the U.S. Northeast limited demand for the power-plant fuel,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories gained 60 billion cubic feet, or 2.1 percent,
to 2.966 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Aug. 26, based on
the median of 17 estimates. The five-year average stockpile
change for the week is also an increase of 60 billion, according
to Energy Department data. Supplies climbed 52 billion cubic
feet a year earlier.  Temperatures were mostly normal in the Northeast and mid-
Atlantic last week, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland . The high temperature in New York on Aug. 24
was 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius), 2 below normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.  “There were some cooler temperatures in the Northeast, so
demand was fairly balanced,” said Jason Schenker, the president
of Prestige Economics, an energy advisory company in Austin,
Texas. “The weather mitigated the demand for natural gas.”  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 54 billion
to 70 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department’s next weekly
supply report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington .  Natural gas for September delivery fell 0.9 cent to $3.931
per million British thermal units last week on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices today gained 14.5 cents, or 3.7
percent, to settle at $4.054.  To contact the reporter on this story:
