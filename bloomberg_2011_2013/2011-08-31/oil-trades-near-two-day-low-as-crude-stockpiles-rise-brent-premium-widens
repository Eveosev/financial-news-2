Oil traded near a two-day low in  New
York  after the biggest monthly drop since May as investors bet
rising U.S. crude stockpiles indicate that fuel demand is
faltering in the world’s biggest consumer of the commodity.  Futures were little changed after an Energy Information
Administration report yesterday showed supplies increased 5.28
million barrels last week to 357.1 million. They were forecast
to decline by 500,000 barrels, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of analysts. London-traded Brent oil widened its premium
to U.S. prices for a third day.  “U.S. crude oil prices fell modestly after the release of
the weekly EIA energy report,” James McIntyre, an economist at
Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , said in a note today. “Crude
stockpiles rose by a surprising 5.28 million barrels last week
against expectations.”  Crude for October delivery was at $88.78 a barrel, down 3
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 10:55 a.m. Sydney time. The contract yesterday fell 9 cents
to $88.81, the lowest settlement since Aug. 29. Prices dropped
7.2 percent last month and are down 2.9 percent this year.  Brent oil for October settlement was at $114.86 a barrel,
up 1 cent, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Prices fell 1.6 percent last month. The European benchmark
contract was at a premium of $26.10 to U.S. futures, compared
with a record close of $26.21 on Aug. 19.  OPEC Output  The increase in U.S. crude stockpiles was the largest since
the seven days ended April 22. Gasoline inventories fell 2.8
million barrels to 208.6 million, the Energy Department report
showed. They were estimated to drop 1.05 million barrels, the
Bloomberg survey shows. Total products supplied, a measure of
fuel demand, rose 1.7 percent to 19.6 million barrels a day, the
first gain in three weeks.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ crude
output in August rose to the highest level since November 2008,
led by  Saudi Arabia , which pumped the most oil since at least
1989, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Production increased
90,000 barrels to average 30.03 million barrels a day, according
to the survey of  oil companies , producers and analysts.  Tropical Storm Katia is likely to become a hurricane today,
according to an advisory by the National Hurricane Center at
about 4:40 p.m. New York time yesterday. Katia was about 1,285
miles (2,070 kilometers) east of the Leeward Islands with 70 mph
winds and moving west-northwest at 20 mph, the  advisory  said.  The storm, which will become a hurricane when its winds
reach 74 mph, is traveling on a path that will take it to waters
northeast of  Puerto Rico  on Sept. 4, the Miami-based center
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
