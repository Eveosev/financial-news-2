U.K. 10-year bonds fell for a second
day, paring their gains for the month, as rising equities
reduced demand for the perceived safety of fixed income.  Two-year British securities declined with German notes and
Treasuries as U.S. stocks rallied, erasing the Dow Jones
Industrial Average’s 2011 losses, after a report showed that
American companies added 91,000 workers to payrolls. The pound
fell against the dollar as London-based research group GfK NOP
Ltd. said an index of consumer sentiment slipped this month,
stoking bets that the  Bank of England  will keep  interest rates 
at a record low.  “Right now, it’s risk appetite” pushing yields higher,
said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole SA in  London . “We are seeing higher stocks and the
sell-off in fixed income is getting a second wind.”  Ten-year gilt yields rose nine basis points to 2.60 percent
at 4:28 p.m. in London, reducing their decline since July 29 to
26 basis points. The 3.75 percent security due September 2020
fell 0.785, or 7.85 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,628) face amount,
to 109.230. Two-year yields rose four basis points to 0.60
percent, ending the month three basis points lower.  The U.K. currency was 0.2 percent weaker at $1.6271, poised
for a 0.9 percent decline this month. The pound was little
changed at 88.65 pence per euro, after earlier falling to 88.85
pence, the weakest level since Aug. 10.  Gilts have handed investors an 8.3 percent return in 2011,
compared with 5.7 percent from German debt and 7.5 percent from
U.S. Treasuries, according to the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Gilts gained 2.7 percent this
month, the indexes show.  Consumer Sentiment  U.K. bonds have gained as investors sought a haven from
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and reduced bets on higher rates
from the Bank of England.  The pound has declined 7.8 percent in the past year against
a basket of currencies from 10 developed markets, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. Only the dollar
fell more, losing 14 percent.  GfK said its index of consumer sentiment slipped 1 point to
minus 31 from July. Business confidence in the economic outlook
slumped this month to the lowest since 2009, Lloyds Bank
Corporate Markets said yesterday.  Nationwide Building Society 
will probably say tomorrow that  house prices  stagnated this
month, after increasing 0.2 percent in July, according to the
median estimate of nine economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The U.K. data has been extremely disappointing,” said
 John Hydeskov , chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S in London. “We
should just get used to sterling trading at weak levels. Current
levels make sense at this environment, as sterling has no
support from monetary policy. I’m not really a big fan.”  Sterling may depreciate to 94 pence against the 17-nation
euro over 12 months, Hydeskov said. The median of analysts’
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg News is for the pound to trade
at 88 pence through the first quarter of 2012 and strengthen to
86 pence by the end of June.  Britain plans to sell 3 billion pounds of 3.75 percent
bonds maturing in 2021 tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
