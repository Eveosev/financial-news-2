Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained
after the central bank said it would abolish a cap on bank
lending. The dong rose.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam will scrap a regulation that
prevents commercial banks from lending more than 80 percent of
their deposits from tomorrow, it said in a statement on its
website late yesterday. The move is expected to cut banks’
capital costs, creating conditions for them to reduce lending
rates, according to Giang Trung Kien, head of analyst at FPT
Securities Joint-Stock Co.  “Investors are expecting that bonds yields will drop as
the central bank’s new measure would help reduce the cost of
credit for companies,” said Hanoi-based Luu Hai Yen, analyst at
Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co.  Five-year yields fell 11 basis points to 12.47 percent
today, the lowest level since July 22, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong rose 0.3 percent to 20,780 per dollar as of 4:52
p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks. The central bank
set the  reference rate  at 20,628 today, unchanged since Aug. 24,
its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1
percent on either side of the official rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang. Editor:  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
