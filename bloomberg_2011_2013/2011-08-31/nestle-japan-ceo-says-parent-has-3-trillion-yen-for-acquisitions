Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s biggest food
company, is capable of putting together 3 trillion yen ($39
billion) that could be used for mergers and acquisitions, the
chief executive officer of its Japan unit said.  “I’m thinking we could put together about 3 trillion
yen,” Kozo Takaoka, chief executive officer of Nestle Japan
Ltd., told reporters in  Tokyo  today. The company doesn’t have
specific targets, but is “prepared to discuss deals when we see
opportunities,” he said.  “We would like to clarify that our guidance on
acquisitions remains unchanged,” Melanie Kohli, a spokeswoman
for Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle, said in an e-mail. “We are
continuously looking into bolt-on acquisitions where they make
strategic sense.” A call to Kohli to confirm the e-mail wasn’t
immediately returned.  Nestle has stepped up expansion in  China , announcing in
July the $1.7 billion purchase of a 60 percent stake in candy
maker Hsu Fu Chi International Ltd. Nestle has said it aims to
boost its proportion of sales from emerging markets to 45
percent by 2020 from about 40 percent. Unilever, the maker of
Magnum ice cream, gets about 54 percent of revenue from
developing regions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
