OTP Bank Nyrt., the largest lender
in  Hungary , dropped for a second day after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  signaled he may make banks share losses suffered by
borrowers in foreign-currency loans.  The stock fell 0.7 percent to 4,150 forint at its 5:06 p.m.
close in Budapest, after earlier sliding as much as 2.6 percent.
OTP lost 24 percent in August, its biggest monthly retreat since
February 2009.  Finding how lenders may share the losses with households
“will be one of the most important tasks of the autumn,” Orban
said in an interview on public radio MR1 today. The government
may expand its program designed to help struggling borrowers, he
said.  The BUX index rose 2.1 percent today as gains by oil
refiner Mol Nyrt. and phone operator Magyar Telekom Nyrt., with
a combined weighting of 43 percent, offset declines by OTP,
which accounts for 28 percent of the gauge. Speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve will stimulate growth in the world’s largest
economy spurred equities higher worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
