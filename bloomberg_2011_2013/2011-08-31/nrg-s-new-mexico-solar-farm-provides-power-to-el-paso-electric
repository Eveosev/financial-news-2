NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) , which operates power
plants with capacity to supply about 20 million homes, began
delivering electricity to utility  El Paso Electric Co. (EE)  from a
solar farm near Santa Teresa, New Mexico.  The 20-megawatt Roadrunner Solar Generating Facility is
NRG’s third large-scale solar project to enter operation and its
first outside California, the Princeton, New Jersey-based
company said today in a statement. El Paso will buy 
Roadrunner’s power for 20 years. The plant uses thin-film
photovoltaic panels supplied by  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , which also
built the plant and will be responsible for maintenance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
