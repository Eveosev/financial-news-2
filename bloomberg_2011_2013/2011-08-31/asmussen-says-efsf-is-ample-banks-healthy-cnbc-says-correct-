(Corrects to show Asmussen is the Deputy Finance Minister
in first paragraph.)  Germany  sees no need to increase the
European Financial Stability Facility from the current 440
billion euros ($635 billion), Deputy Finance Minister  Joerg Asmussen  said in an interview with CNBC television.  The package, combined with the International Monetary
Fund’s contribution, is sufficient to limit debt contagion in
the euro area, CNBC cited Asmussen as saying.  The EFSF “as a tool has enough to limit contagion and this
is a real step forward,” Asmussen said. “When we come to the
size, we are building up an effective lending capacity of 440
billion euros. On top of this you have IMF money available. So I
think the size of the EFSF is enough.”  Asmussen also sees no immediate need to recapitalize
 Europe ’s banks as capital ratios increase, according to the
report. “One needs to be prepared and this is why we have the
new tool at the EFSF if something happens in the future,” he is
cited as saying.  The Deputy Finance Minister expressed confidence that
European leaders will find a solution for  Finland , which is
seeking collateral for a second Greek bailout, CNBC said.  “This is a very thin line,” Asmussen said. “We have some
time to go because the secondary program will not reach us,
let’s say, before October but I’m confident that we will find a
solution.”  He repeated Germany’s rejection of joint euro bonds,
according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
