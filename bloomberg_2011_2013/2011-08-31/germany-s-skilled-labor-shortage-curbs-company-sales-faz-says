A lack of skilled German labor is
limiting profits at every seventh engineering company,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung   reported , citing a study by the
Gesamtmetall employers’ association. Half the companies are
having difficulties finding apprentices, it said.  Twenty-five percent of workers employed in low-wage
industries manage to move to a better-paid position every year,
the newspaper cited a study by the company-sponsored, Cologne-
based IW institute as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
