Tottenham signed West Ham midfielder
 Scott Parker , the Premier League club said on its website.  Parker, 30, yesterday put in a formal transfer request at
West Ham, which was relegated to the second-tier Championship
after last season. Tottenham didn’t give financial terms of 
the move.  Parker, who joined West Ham in 2007 from Newcastle, was
named the Football Writers’ Association player of the year last
season despite playing for the Premier League’s last-place team.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
