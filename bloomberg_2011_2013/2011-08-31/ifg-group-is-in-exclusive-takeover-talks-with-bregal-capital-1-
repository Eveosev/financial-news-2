IFG Group Plc (IFP) , the subject of two
takeover approaches since April, said it’s entered exclusive
talks on a potential 231.2 million-euro ($334 million) accord
with Bregal Capital LLP, the london-based private equity firm.  “If concluded, the proposal contemplates a transaction
whereby IFG shareholders would receive a cash offer of 1.80
euros ($1.80) per IFG share cum dividend,” the Dublin-based
pensions adviser and administration company said in a statement
today. Bregal may provide an alternative for IFG shareholders to
reinvest their offer proceeds in the bid vehicle, it said. The
exclusivity period expires Oct. 10.  IFG has risen 27 percent in Dublin trading this year,
making it the fourth-best performing stock on the 51-member ISEQ
Index after the company said May 4 it received a takeover
approach. The second approach was from Fiordland Investment
Ltd., which owns 19 percent of the company, in May.  IFG’s first-half operating profit rose to 11.9 million
pounds ($19.4 million) from 9.8 million pounds a year earlier,
it said in a separate statement. This is the first time the
company has reported figures in sterling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
