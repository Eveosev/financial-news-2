Colombia’s peso rose to a one-week
high as optimism the  U.S. economy  will continue to expand led to
boosted appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso climbed 0.5 percent to 1,778.03 per dollar at 3:13
p.m. New York time, from 1,786.30 yesterday. Earlier it touched
1,776.82, its strongest level since Aug. 23. The peso was little
changed this month, and is up 6.8 percent in the past six
months, the best performance among 25 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  A report today showed business activity in the U.S.
expanded in August at a faster pace than forecast, a signal
companies are looking beyond the slowdown in growth. The U.S. is
Colombia’s biggest trading partner, buying about 40 percent of
the nation’s sales abroad.  “Investors are taking advantage of positive data out of
the U.S. today to buy riskier assets,” said Juan Camilo Santana, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Cia. de
Profesionales de Bolsa SA. “That’s why we’re seeing gains in
Latin American currencies including the peso.”  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.39
percent. The bond’s yield fell 25 basis points this month. The
price fell 0.238 centavo today to 121.247 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
