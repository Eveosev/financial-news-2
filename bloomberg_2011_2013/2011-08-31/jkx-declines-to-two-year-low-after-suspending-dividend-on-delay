JKX Oil and Gas Plc, the London-
based oil and gas producer active in  Ukraine  and  Russia ,
retreated after suspending its dividend following a delay in
starting a Russian gas plant.  The company’s shares dropped 9.1 pence, or 4.6 percent, to
close at 187.4 pence in London. JKX said it will forgo a
dividend payment for the first half after the delay and higher
taxes in Ukraine hurt  cash flow .  JKX’s Koshekhablskoye project in Russia, which will
increase production by about 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day, has been pushed back to the end of the year from a planned
start in the autumn. Production in the first half slipped 19
percent from a year earlier to 9,476 barrels a day after the
company said in March it could reach a 20,000 barrel-a-day
target in 2011.  “This year has been a tough one for us,” Chief Executive
Officer Paul Davies said in a telephone interview. “The board
will address dividends at year end after making a prudent call
for the first half.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
