Merck KGaA (MRK)  said its cancer drug
Erbitux extended the lives of patients with a form of advanced
colon cancer more than seven months longer than those taking
 Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s Avastin.  In a trial among 342 patients with advanced colon cancer
lacking certain genetic mutations, those receiving Erbitux had a
median survival of 33.1 months, compared with 25.6 months for
those treated with Avastin, according to data to be presented
today at a cancer conference in Amsterdam. Both drugs were
combined with chemotherapy.  The findings suggest a role for Erbitux in a sub-group of
patients with so-called RAS wild-type tumors, after Merck said
in June that the study missed its main goal of shrinking tumors
more than Avastin. Merck, based in Darmstadt, Germany, plans to
examine the results of two other trials for evidence of the same
trend, with a view to seeking regulatory approval in Europe for
the drug.  “Of course we are highly interested to get the right
treatment to the right patients,” Oliver Kisker, head of
clinical development at Merck’s Serono unit, said in a telephone
interview. “Seven-point-five months is very impressive, very
interesting.”  Erbitux generated sales for Merck of 887 million euros
($1.2 billion). The German company sells the medicine outside
 North America .  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) , based in New York, and
Indianapolis-based  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  are the partners for the drug
in the U.S.  Germany’s Merck isn’t related to U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co.
