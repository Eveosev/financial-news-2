domestic money in Italy that will support the market, obviously
at a price.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  climbed 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, this week to 4.42 percent at 5 p.m.  London

9.95 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,354) face amount, to 101.01.  Italian bonds have dropped this week as People of Liberty
lawmakers led by Berlusconi threatened to resign en masse if the
former premier’s tax-fraud conviction leads the Senate to oust
him. Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s  Democratic Party , the largest
group in parliament, has said the expulsion is required under a
law passed last year.  Bunds Gain  Germany ’s  10-year bund  yield fell 17 basis points this week
