British armed-forces employees will
have access to a 200 million-pound ($322 million) fund to help
them buy their first homes, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond
said.  Staff will be allowed to borrow as much as half their
annual salaries, not exceeding 25,000 pounds, interest-free to
use as a deposit, Hammond said in an e-mailed statement today.  “By giving our troops this extra help they will be more
able to set down roots and get onto the property ladder,”
Hammond said in the statement. “The introduction of this new
scheme will help increase home ownership, and provide our armed
forces with sustainable lifestyle choices.”  Home ownership among armed-forces staff is low and
departing personnel cite their desire to own property as a key
reason for leaving, according to the statement. The debt will be
repayable over 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
