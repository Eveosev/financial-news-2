Margaret Thatcher ’s ashes were
interred in the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London,
almost six months after the first female U.K. prime minister
died, the Press Association reported.  Members of Thatcher’s family attended a short church
service today before her ashes were buried, the news agency
said.  Thatcher, known as the “Iron Lady” for her uncompromising
style, died on April 8. She was 87.  To contact the reporter on this story:
