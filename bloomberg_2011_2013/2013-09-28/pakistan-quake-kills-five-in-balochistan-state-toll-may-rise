Five people died in  Pakistan  after
a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck the country’s Balochistan
province, hitting the same district as a Sept. 24 temblor.  “The death toll includes three children, and it could
rise,” Amjad Baloch, a government spokesman, said by phone.
“The deaths have been reported in the district’s Nokjo village,
which has a population of 15,000 people to 20,000 people. All
the homes there are now rubble.”  The quake struck several cities in Balochistan and the
neighboring Sindh province, forcing an evacuation of hospitals
and buildings, according to Edhi Foundation, Pakistan’s largest
rescue service. Channels including Geo and Metro News showed
lawmakers running out of a session in the state assembly of
Balochistan as the tremors shook walls and chandeliers.  Hospitals developed cracks in Quetta, the provincial
capital of Balochistan, Edhi’s Sardar Khan said on the phone
from Karachi.  The Sept. 24 temblor left 355 people dead and 619 injured.  For Related News and Information:
