The Miami Marlins, who at 60-100
have the worst record in the National League, fired team
president of baseball operations Larry Beinfest and one of his
deputies, Jim Fleming.  Beinfest, 49, who had been with the Marlins for 12 years,
was general manager in 2003 when they won the World Series. The
team has not returned to the playoffs since then, and has
undergone a series of managerial changes as well as twice
dumping star players to cut payroll under owner Jeffrey Loria.  “The Marlins organization has decided to make some changes
at the helm of our baseball operations,” Loria wrote in a
statement posted yesterday on the Marlins’ website. “I will
soon be making further announcements in terms of our new
structure in baseball operations.”  The Marlins have shed All-Stars and their salaries three
times in the past 16 years, including after Major League
Baseball championships in 1997 and 2003.  The team moved last season into a $515 million,
retractable-roof ballpark that was 80 percent publicly financed,
and significantly raised its payroll by signing free agents
including former  New York  Mets shortstop Jose Reyes.  After going 69-93 in 2012, the Marlins sent Reyes
and three other All-Stars to the Toronto Blue Jays for minor-league prospects and financial relief.  “I was just fired by Jeffrey Loria,” Beinfest wrote in a
text message to reporters. “I look forward to continuing my 24-year MLB career in the near future.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
