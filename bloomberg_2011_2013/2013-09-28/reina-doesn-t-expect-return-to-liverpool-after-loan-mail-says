Goalkeeper Pepe Reina doesn’t
expect to return to Liverpool when his loan spell at Napoli
ends, the  Daily Mail  said.  Reina, 31, was loaned to Napoli before the season after
Liverpool signed Simon Mignolet from Sunderland. The Spaniard
said he was suprised by his move to  Italy  after finding out
about it while on holiday.  “They have a young goalkeeper in Simon Mignolet and the
manager prefers him to me,” Reina, who has three years left on
his Liverpool deal, told the Mail. “That’s the reason why I’m
here and he will be at the club next year as well. There’s no
reason to think I’ll be a Liverpool player from now on but we’ll
see where the future takes us.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
