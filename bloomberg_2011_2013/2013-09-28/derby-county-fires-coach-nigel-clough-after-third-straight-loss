Derby County fired manager Nigel
Clough after the team’s third loss in eight days, the second-tier English soccer club said on its website.  Derby lost 1-0 today to Nottingham Forest to drop to 14th
place in the 24-team Championship. Clough had been in charge of
the Rams since January 2009, making him the league’s longest-serving manager.  “After much consideration, the board feels it is time to
move Derby County forward to the next level, which will
necessitate a comprehensive review of the club’s football
operations,” the club said in a statement.  Clough followed in the footsteps of his father Brian, who
coached Derby to the English title in 1972. The Rams’ 10th-place
finish last season was their best under the younger Clough.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
