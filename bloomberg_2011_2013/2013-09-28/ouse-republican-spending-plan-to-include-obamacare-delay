House Republican leaders are
proposing to attach a one-year delay of Obamacare provisions and
a repeal of the medical-device tax to a short-term spending bill
and send it to the Senate, said Representatives Michael McCaul
and  Kevin Brady  of Texas.  The move probably would provoke a partial government
shutdown Oct 1.  House Republicans, torn by internal strategic and policy
disputes, are meeting today at the Capitol in Washington.
They’re planning their response to the Senate’s passage
yesterday of a bill that would keep the government open through
Nov. 15 without Republican-backed language that would defund the
health law.  A House vote may occur as soon as this afternoon.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, said
yesterday that the Senate would reject any changes and warned
that House revisions to the Senate bill would lead to a
shutdown.  To contact the reporters on this story:
