The pound rose against the dollar
for a fourth week, the longest streak in a year, as Bank of
England Governor  Mark Carney  said he sees no case for further
stimulus measures that typically debase the currency.  Sterling strengthened versus all but one of its 16 major
peers as a gauge of U.K.  consumer confidence  climbed to the
highest in almost six years in September and  house prices  rose
for a fifth month. Carney told the Yorkshire Post the central
bank would consider expanding its bond purchases, known as
quantitative easing, only if the economy faltered. U.K.
government bonds advanced, posting their biggest weekly gain
since March.  “The pound’s recent strength is pretty much on the back of
stronger economic data and comments from Carney,” said  Ian Stannard , head of European currency strategy at Morgan Stanley
in  London . “Our view on the pound remains bearish given its
vulnerable external position, but in the near term sterling may
continue to enjoy some support from data surprises.”  The pound gained 0.8 percent from last week to $1.6133 at
4:55 p.m. London time yesterday after climbing to $1.6163 on
Sept. 18, the highest since Jan. 11. The four-week gain is the
longest since the period ended Sept. 21, 2012. Sterling
strengthened 0.7 percent to 83.92 pence per euro after
appreciating to 83.53 pence on Sept. 18, the strongest since
Jan. 17.  Confidence Rises  GfK NOP Ltd.’s  consumer-sentiment index  rose to minus 10
this month, the highest since November 2007, from minus 13 in
August, the London-based group said yesterday. U.K.  house prices 
increased 0.9 percent after climbing an upwardly revised 0.7
percent in August, according to  Nationwide Building Society .  “My personal view is, given the recovery has strengthened
and broadened, I don’t see a case for quantitative easing and I
have not supported it,” Carney said in an interview with the
Yorkshire Post published on its website yesterday.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction 4
billion pounds of 10-year gilts on Oct. 3. The U.K. last sold
the benchmark securities on Sept. 12 at an average yield of
2.976 percent, the highest since June 2011.  U.K. manufacturing expanded further in September, a report
next week is forecast to show. Markit and the  Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply  will say on Sept. 30 that
their gauge of factory activity increased to 57.5 from 57.2 in
August, according to the median estimate of 23 analysts surveyed
by  Bloomberg News . A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Gilts Rise  The pound has risen 6.8 percent in the past six months, the
best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro appreciated 6
percent, while the dollar weakened 0.6 percent.  The yield on benchmark 10-year gilt dropped 21 basis points
from last week to 2.71 percent, the steepest decline since the
period ended March 1. The rate touched 2.70 percent yesterday,
the least since Aug. 27. The 2.25 percent bond due in September
2023 rose 1.8, or 18 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
96.035.  U.K. gilts lost 3.3 percent this year through Sept. 26,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German securities
fell 1.7 percent and Treasuries declined 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
