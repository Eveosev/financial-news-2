The  Cleveland Indians  moved into a
tie with the Tampa Bay Bays for the two American League wild-card spots with two games left in the Major League Baseball
regular season.  The Indians (90-70) won 12-6 at the Minnesota Twins for
their eighth straight victory as the Rays (90-70) lost 6-3 at
the Toronto Blue Jays.  The  Texas Rangers  (89-71) won 5-3 at home against the Los
Angeles Angels and are one game behind the Indians and Rays in
the battle for the wild-card spots that go to the two best teams
in each league that have not won division titles.  In the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals (95-65)
clinched the Central division title with their fourth straight
win, a 7-0 defeat of the visiting  Chicago Cubs .  In the battle for home-field advantage in the NL wild-card
playoff, the Pittsburgh Pirates (92-68) won 4-1 against the
Cincinnati Reds (90-70) to take a two-game lead over the Reds
with two games between the teams remaining at Cincinnati.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
