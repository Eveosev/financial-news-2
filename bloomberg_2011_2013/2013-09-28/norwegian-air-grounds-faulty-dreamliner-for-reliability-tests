Norwegian Air Shuttle AS (NAS)  is taking
one of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes out of service for
repairs and will lease an Airbus A340 to ensure all scheduled
fights continue to run between  Sweden  and the U.S. and Thailand.  The Dreamliner, Norwegian Air’s second, will be taken “out
of operation for maintenance work and testing so it can give us
the reliability we expect,” Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen, a spokesman
for Norwegian Air, said by phone today. The plane is stranded in
Bangkok after a hydraulic pump broke and will be returned to
 Stockholm  today or tomorrow.  Norwegian Air is grappling with technical glitches on the
Dreamliner, from cockpit oxygen supply issues that delayed a
flight to  New York  from Oslo on Sept. 22, to brake difficulties
that affected the second 787 in Sweden this month. The global
fleet of Dreamliners was grounded earlier this year after some
batteries on planes operated by Japanese carriers caught fire.  The Norwegian company said Sept. 23 it planned to confront
Boeing Co. about the technical difficulties and that “something
must happen, fast.” Norwegian Air, which last year ordered 222
Boeing and Airbus airliners valued at 127 billion kroner ($21.2
billion), is flying new routes and opening bases outside the
Nordic region as it steps up competition with state-backed  SAS
Group AB. (SAS)   “We’re taking one of our 787s out of long-haul operations
in order for Boeing to improve the reliability of the aircraft
so that our passengers won’t be subject to the delays that they
have been experiencing recently,” Sandaker-Nielsen said.  Boeing’s flagship airliner, distinctive for its composite
fuselage and electrical architecture, also came under scrutiny
after one caught fire in  London  in July. The blaze was later
linked to defective wiring in an emergency beacon widely used by
airlines. The jet made its commercial debut in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
