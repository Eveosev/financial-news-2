The Hawthorn Hawks beat the
Fremantle Dockers by 15 points in the Australian Football League
grand final to win their second premiership in six seasons.  Jack Gunston kicked a game-high four goals and Jarryd
Roughead added two as the Hawks, who finished atop the regular
season standings, won 11.11 (77) to 8.14 (62) in front of a
crowd of 100,007 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  Hawthorn, which lost to the Sydney Swans by 10 points in
last year’s championship game, secured its 11th title to move
ahead of the Richmond Tigers into fifth place on the list of
total premierships.  Full-back Brian Lake, who had 26 disposals and 10 marks,
beat Gunston by a single vote to win the Norm Smith Medal as the
game’s most valuable player after marshaling Hawthorn’s defense.  Fremantle captain Matthew Pavlich booted three six-pointers
for the Dockers, who were seeking their first premiership title.
Fremantle was playing in its first grand final since joining the
AFL in 1995 as the second team from  Western Australia .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
