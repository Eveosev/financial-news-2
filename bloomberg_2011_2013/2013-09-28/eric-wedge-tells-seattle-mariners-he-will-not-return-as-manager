Seattle Mariners  manager Eric Wedge
decided he will not return after this season, the team said in a
news release.  Wedge, 45, who spent the past three seasons as the
Mariners’ manager, told club officials yesterday that he will
lead the club only through its season-ending home weekend series
against the  Oakland Athletics .  Wedge, who managed the  Cleveland Indians  for seven seasons
in 2003-09 before joining Seattle, was the 2007 American League
manager of the year after leading the Indians to a Central
division title. He has led the Mariners to three straight
fourth-place finishes in the AL West.  “I accept Eric’s decision not to return and thank him for
his hard work here the past three years,” General Manager Jack Zduriencik said in a statement released by the Mariners. “I
want to wish him and his family all the best in the future.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
