Aksigorta AS  gained the most in more
than three months as the Turkish insurer co-owned by Belgium’s
 Ageas  said it would seek to boost earnings by as much as 30
percent this year after 2012 profit topped estimates.  The shares climbed 3.7 percent to close at 2.24 liras in
Istanbul, the biggest advance since Nov. 1. About 818,000 shares
were traded, or 157 percent of the stock’s three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Istanbul
Stock Exchange National 100 index  fell 0.2 percent.  The Istanbul-based insurer reported a 52 percent jump in
2012 net income to 48.7 million liras ($27.5 million), exceeding
the 36.8 million-lira average estimate compiled by Bloomberg
from six analysts. Aksigorta aims to boost profit by 20 percent
to 30 percent this year as premiums grow as much as 16 percent,
according to a bourse filing.  “This guidance is above what the market expected,”  Tamer Sengun , an analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc in Istanbul, said by
phone today. “It’s reflecting well on the share price.”  Belgian insurer Ageas acquired 31 percent of Aksigorta for
$220 million in February 2011 and has since increased its stake
to 36 percent. Two analysts recommend investors buy the shares,
four say to hold them and two advise selling, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
