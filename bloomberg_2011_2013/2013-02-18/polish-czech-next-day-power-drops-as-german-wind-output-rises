Day-ahead power in Poland and the
Czech Republic dropped amid forecasts for higher wind output in
Germany.  Electricity  for next-day delivery in Poland declined 1.3
percent to 167.93 zloty ($53.45) a megawatt-hour, exchange data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia fell 0.2 percent to 48.23 euros ($64.34) a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countriesâ€™
market operators.  Hungarian day-ahead power  settled 0.3 percent
lower, also at 48.23 euros a megawatt-hour.  Wind output in Germany is predicted to rise to about 5
gigawatts tomorrow, Meteologica SA, a Madrid-based weather
forecaster, said on its website. That compares with 0.43
gigawatts at 12:45 p.m. today, data from European Energy
Exchange AG in Leipzig, Germany showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
