APN News and Media Ltd. , publisher
of the New Zealand Herald newspaper, slumped the most in two
months in Sydney trading after its chairman and chief executive
officer resigned amid pressure from its largest shareholder.  Shares  of the company fell 8.3 percent, the most since Dec.
14, to 27.5 Australian cents at the close in Sydney. Chief
Executive Officer  Brett Chenoweth , Chairman Peter Hunt, and
three independent directors have resigned because of a
disagreement with Independent News & Media Plc., the company
said in a regulatory statement yesterday.  Independent News and fund manager Allan Gray Australia
Pty., the company’s two largest shareholders with about 51
percent of shares, “unequivocally indicated they are opposed to
a capital raising” that the directors planned so as to raise
cash and pay down debt.  Peter Cosgrove , a former Independent
News director, will replace Hunt as chairman, APN said today.  APN needs to sell about A$100 million ($103 million) of new
shares, about half its market value, to reduce  net debt  to about
double its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, according to  Samantha Carleton , an analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Sydney.  Independent directors Melinda Conrad, John Harvey, and John
Maasland will leave immediately along with Hunt and Chenoweth,
while Kevin Luscombe will retire in April as previously planned,
the Sydney-based company said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
