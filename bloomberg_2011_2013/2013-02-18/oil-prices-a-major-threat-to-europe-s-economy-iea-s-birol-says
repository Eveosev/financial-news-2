Oil prices are acting as a brake on
the global economy, and harming Europe in particular, the
International Energy Agency’s chief economist said at a
conference in London today.  Europe will need to spend 500 billion euros ($668 billion)
on oil imports this year, about 200 billion euros more than
average levels, if oil prices remain near current levels, the
IEA’s  Fatih Birol , said in London at the start of International
Petroleum Week.  “Prices are very high,” he said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. The “current level of oil prices is a major impact
on the global economy, but especially for Europe.”  Asked by reporters if IEA members are considering a release
of emergency stockpiles, Birol said the agency doesn’t “discuss
stocks just when prices are rising. We do it when there is a
supply disruption.”  The IEA’s annual World Energy Outlook report, due later
this year, will focus on U.S. oil supply, Birol said.  IEA is a policy adviser to 28 industrialized nations, most
of whom are net oil importers.  More than 80 percent of oil projects worldwide have been
delayed by about three years because of technical challenges and
security issues, Birol added. “We will see more and more delays
in delivering production.”  Brent crude oil futures traded near $118 a barrel today on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  -- With assistance from Guy Johnson Francine Editors: Stephen
