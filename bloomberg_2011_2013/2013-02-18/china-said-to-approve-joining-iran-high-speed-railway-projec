(Corrects spelling of government body’s name in first
paragraph in story initially published Feb. 18.)  China’s State Council approved plans
to take part in the building of a high-speed railway line in
Iran, two people familiar with the matter said.  The project will cost at least $1 billion and the companies
participating haven’t yet been set, said the two people, who
asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to
speak publicly about the matter.  China’s decision comes as the U.S., the European Union and
their allies have tightened sanctions on Iran for a nuclear
program they argue is meant to develop atomic bombs. Iran
maintains its program is peaceful.  China and Iran have maintained “normal business
 cooperation ,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a
briefing in Beijing today. China is the biggest buyer of Iranian
crude oil.  Current sanctions are costing Iran about $98.9 million a
day in lost oil sales, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Iran is
to resume stalled multilateral discussions on its nuclear
program with the U.S., U.K. France, Germany, Russia and China on
Feb. 26 in Kazakhstan. The last round of negotiations between
Iran and the group, known as P5+1, failed to yield results.  The U.S. imposed new sanctions earlier this month that
would keep importers from paying for oil with dollars and euros.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
