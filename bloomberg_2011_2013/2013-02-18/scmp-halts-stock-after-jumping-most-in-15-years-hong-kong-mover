SCMP Group Ltd. , the publisher of
the South China Morning Post, halted its  stock  from trading in
Hong Kong after it jumped the most in more than 15 years.  The company plans to make “an announcement in relation to
unusual price and trading movements and inside information,” it
said in a filing today, without elaboration. Jennifer Shay, a
spokeswoman for the Hong Kong-based publisher, didn’t respond to
an e-mail and phone call for response.  SCMP , which produces Hong Kong’s only paid-for English-
language daily newspaper, surged as much as 31 percent amid
speculation its largest shareholder, billionaire  Robert Kuok ’s
Kerry Media Ltd., could be planning to take the company private
or sell it. The publisher is in danger of being delisted later
this month because the proportion of shares held by minority
investors may drop below a minimum requirement.  “The run-up this morning in the stock is presumably some
leakage about some alternative they might be negotiating with
their largest shareholders,” said  David Webb , an independent
financial commentator based in Hong Kong and former stock
exchange director. “ SCMP  does still make money.”  The publisher had  net income  of HK$184 million ($24
million) in the first half of last year, on sales of HK$458
million. The newspaper, first published in 1903, has a weekday
circulation of 108,047, the company said in a  marketing brochure 
on its website, citing the Hong Kong Audit Bureau of
Circulations Ltd.  SCMP  was up 23 percent at HK$2.15, headed for the biggest
advance since October 1997, when it was halted. It traded for as
much as HK$2.29 earlier today. The publisher has a market value
of about $433 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Free Float  The company could be delisted as Kerry Media may be
obligated to buy a 14 percent stake owned by banks under options
due to expire Feb. 27, according to a Jan. 17 statement. That
would cut the publisher’s free float to around 11 percent from
about 25 percent, based on numbers in the statement.  Kuok, 89, bought a controlling stake in  SCMP  from media
tycoon Rupert Murdoch in 1993. The company’s sales declined to
HK$946 million in 2011 from HK$2.4 billion in 1997, as readers
turned to the Internet and other media for news.  Kuok is ranked 38th in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index
with a net worth of $18.8 billion. He also has interests in
property, hotels, palm oil and shipping.  The SCMP’s local rival, the Standard, stopped charging
readers in 2007 to boost circulation after the government ended
a requirement for companies to publish stock-exchange
announcements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
