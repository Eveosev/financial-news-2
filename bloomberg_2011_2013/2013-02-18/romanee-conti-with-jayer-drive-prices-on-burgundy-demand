Top Burgundies including  Romanee-
Conti  and  Henri Jayer  are driving investment-grade wine prices
at auction this year. Demand for rarities has combined with
buyers seeking value in Bordeaux following a market slide.  A six-magnum case of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Assortment
1990 fetched HK$541,200 ($69,400) at an Acker Merrall & Condit
sale in Hong Kong last month, more than 15 percent up from last
year, while a  Hart Davis Hart  sale in Chicago on Feb. 2 included
two Romanee-Conti 1990 DRC Assortment cases, one of which
fetched $41,825 and the other $38,240.  Demand has been buoyed by this month’s Chinese New Year
celebrations. The London-based  Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index  of
leading clarets rose 3.5 percent in January, its biggest monthly
gain for two years, and the index is up more than 7 percent from
a 31-month low touched in mid-November.  “We’re still keen on Burgundy,”  Peter Lunzer , founder of
Lunzer Wine Investments in London, said in a telephone
interview, noting that demand for top Burgundies far exceeds
supply. “One of the ones that is resilient is Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti.”  Lunzer helps manage investment and trading accounts worth
$34 million, and in a report last week described the region’s
wines as “undoubtedly contenders for our investment portfolios,
even if we often struggle to find sufficient volume.”  A case of La Tache 1999 DRC sold for $38,240 at the Hart
Davis Hart auction, while 12 bottles of 1990 wine from  Jayer ’s
Vosne-Romanee Cros Parantoux vineyard fetched $113,525 at the
same sale.  Cros Parantoux  Jayer, who died in 2006, has become one of Burgundy’s most
sought-after wine-makers. His Cros Parantoux, from a 2.5-acre (1
hectare) premier cru vineyard that was an artichoke field in
World War II, acquired trophy status in sales last year, notably
after a case of the 1985 vintage fetched HK$2.06 million at a
 Christie’s International Plc  auction in Hong Kong last February.  Other Burgundies which featured in the January  Acker  sale
included six bottles of Domaine Dujac Echezeaux 1978, which
fetched HK$196,800, and four three-liter jeroboams of Domaine
Roulot Meursault-Perrieres spanning the years 2007 to 2010,
which sold for HK$137,760.  Two 12-bottle DRC Assortment cases from 1999 sold for
28,200 pounds ($44,600) each at Sotheby’s in London Jan. 30,
according to the auction house. A similar case traded on Liv-ex
in November at 26,400 pounds.  Other Burgundy lots at the  Sotheby’s  sale included a case
of Chambertin 1999 Armand Rousseau and 12 bottles of more recent
Chambertin Clos de Beze 2005 Armand Rousseau, which each sold
for 11,163 pounds.  Lafite Rally  While Burgundies have been driving auction prices, not all
investors are convinced they represent value.  “We’re not buying Burgundy, the timing would be poor,”
 Miles Davis , co-founder and partner in  Wine Asset Managers LLP 
in London, said in a phone interview. “It’s had a good run.
It’s been outperforming for the past year or so.”  WAM has $20 million under management in two funds, all
currently allocated to Bordeaux, including first-growths from
the Medoc such as Chateau Lafite-Rothschild.  “Lafite seems to be reasonably popular again,” Davis
said. “We’ve got a sensible weighting in it.”  A case of Lafite 2009 sold for 7,800 pounds on Liv-ex Feb.
12, a seven-month high on the exchange and extending gains which
lifted it 7 percent from its December level, according to data
on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The Lafite vintage peaked at 14,350 pounds a case in
February 2011 amid strong Asian demand, before a price slump
which took it as low as 6,950 pounds on Dec. 14. Lafite’s 2009
vintage is its most expensive of the past five years, according
to Liv-ex merchant data.  Among leading Bordeaux wines in the Hart Davis Hart sale in
Chicago this month, a case of  Chateau Petrus  1982 fetched
$38,240 and 12 bottles of the same Pomerol producer’s 2008
vintage sold for $28,680. A case of 2009 wine from neighboring
vineyard  Chateau Lafleur  went under the hammer for $20,315.  Following is a table of major auctions held so far this
year.  Muse highlights include:  Martin Gayford  on London
exhibitions, Catherine Hickley on  art  restitution and  Jorg von
Uthmann  on Paris culture.  To contact the reporter on the story:
