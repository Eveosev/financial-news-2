Hong Kong  stocks  declined, with the
Hang Seng Index falling for the first time in four days, as
Chinese property developers and retailers declined.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. , the Chinese developer
controlled by billionaire Hui Wingmau, slipped 2.4 percent on
concern property sales slumped last week. Luk Fook Holdings
International Ltd. fell 1.5 percent, pacing declines among
mainland retailers as retail sales in China rose at the slowest
pace since 2009 during the Lunar New Year holidays. SCMP Group
Ltd., the publisher of South China Morning Post, halted its
stock from trading in Hong Kong after it jumped the most in more
than 15 years.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index  fell 0.3 percent to 23,381.94
at the close, with three companies falling for every two that
gained. Trading volume was about 40 percent below the 30-day
average for the time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of
mainland Chinese companies, lost 0.9 percent to 11,735.22.
Mainland equity markets reopened after the week-long Chinese new
year holiday.  “We are entering a seasonally weaker period,” said  Tim Leung , a portfolio manager who helps oversee about $1.5 billion
at IG Investment Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Valuations and monetary
policy are still supportive but markets ran hard.”  The Hang Seng Index is trading within two percentage points
of its highest level since April 2011, which was reached on Jan.
30. The gauge soared 22 percent from the end of August through
January as data showed the U.S. and Chinese economies are
recovering amid stimulus from central banks.  Index Futures  Futures on the Hang Seng Index slid 0.4 percent to 23,333.
The  HSI Volatility Index  gained 1.9 percent to 14.41, indicating
traders expect a swing of 4.1 percent for the equity benchmark
in the next 30 days.  Exchange-traded funds that attempt to mirror movement of
mainland Chinese listed shares fell. The CSOP FTSE China A50
ETF, which tracks the largest 50 China A-share companies,
declined 1.7 percent. The  ChinaAMC CSI 300 Index ETF , tracking
the CSI 300 Index of shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen, lost 1.6
percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today after the measure slid 0.1 percent on Feb. 15.
U.S. markets are closed today for the Presidents’ Day holiday.
Industrial production in the U.S. unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent
in January as factories took a breather after the biggest back-
to-back gain in three decades.  Li & Fung Ltd., the Hong Kong-based supplier to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., slid 0.8 percent to HK$10.12. Wal-Mart posted its
biggest share-price decline since Dec. 12 on Feb. 15 after
internal e-mails reported the worst sales start to a month in
seven years.  ‘Total Disaster’  “In case you haven’t seen a sales report these days,
February MTD sales are a total disaster,” Jerry Murray, Wal-
Mart’s vice president of finance and logistics, said in a Feb.
12 e-mail to other executives, referring to month-to-date sales.
“The worst start to a month I have seen in my about 7 years
with the company.”  Mainland developers dropped after Shanghai UWin Real Estate
Information Services reported today that new home sales in the
Chinese city declined 79 percent in the week ended Feb. 17.  Shimao Property fell 2.4 percent to HK$15.60.  Sino Ocean
Land Holdings Ltd.  sank 2.8 percent to HK$5.51. China Overseas
Land & Investment Ltd., the biggest Chinese real estate company
traded in Hong Kong, fell 1.1 percent to HK$22.70.  Chinese Retailers  Chinese retailers dropped. Sales at shops and restaurants
monitored by China’s Ministry of Commerce increased 14.7 percent
in the Feb. 9 to Feb. 15 period from the year-earlier break to
539 billion yuan ($86 billion), the ministry said. That was down
from a 16.2 percent pace in 2012, and the least since a 13.8
percent gain in 2009, according to previously released figures.  Luk Fook Holdings declined 1.5 percent to HK$26.  Chow Tai
Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. , the world’s biggest jeweler by market
value, slid 0.8 percent to HK$11.84. Chow Sang Sang Holdings
International Ltd. decreased 2.1 percent to HK$21.25.  China Shenhua Energy Co., the nation’s biggest producer of
the fuel, retreated 1.8 percent to HK$30.25. China Coal Energy
Co. lost 2 percent to HK$7.99. Investors may be selling coal
producers amid speculation China will enact measures to improve
air quality in cities, according to Hong Kong-based UOB Kay Hian
Ltd. analyst,  Helen Lau .  SCMP Jumps  Trading of SCMP Group was halted after the stock soared the
most since October 1997. The shares last traded 23 percent
higher at HK$2.15 on volume that was more than 20 times the
three-month average.  The company plans to make “an announcement in relation to
unusual price and trading movements and inside information,” it
said in a filing today, without elaboration. Jennifer Shay, a
spokeswoman for the Hong Kong-based publisher, didn’t respond to
an e-mail and phone call for response.  SCMP, which produces Hong Kong’s only paid-for English-
language daily newspaper, surged as much as 31 percent amid
speculation its largest shareholder, billionaire  Robert Kuok ’s
Kerry Media Ltd., could be planning to take the company private
or sell it. The publisher is in danger of being delisted later
this month because the proportion of shares held by minority
investors may drop below a minimum requirement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
