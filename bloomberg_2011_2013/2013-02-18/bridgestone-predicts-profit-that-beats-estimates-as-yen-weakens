Bridgestone Corp. , the world’s
biggest tiremaker, forecast a 37 percent surge in profit this
fiscal year as material costs decline, production increases and
a weaker Japanese currency boosts the value of overseas sales.  Net income  will probably jump to 235 billion yen ($2.5
billion) this year from 171.6 billion yen in 2012, Bridgestone
said in a statement today. The  forecast  compares with the 206
billion yen average of 15 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  The tiremaker also expects to increase output 9.6 percent
this year to meeting rising demand in emerging markets, it said
today. Bridgestone is also benefiting from a decline in
materials costs.  “I expect the price of rubber to fall further because of
an excess supply and the weaker yen will of course be an
advantage,” said  Shiro Sakamaki , an analyst at Daiwa Securities
Co. “Considering all these, I’d guess their earnings will grow
even more this year.”  Rubber will probably average between $3.30 and $3.50 a
kilogram this year,  Akihiro Eto , chief financial officer at
Bridgestone, said today in Tokyo at a briefing to discuss
earnings. The material averaged about $3.38 last year, based on
prices for so-called ribbed smoked sheet, grade three.  Bridgestone gets about 80 percent of its revenue outside
Japan, with about 45 percent of sales coming from the Americas
as of the three months ended Sept. 30, according to  data
compiled  by Bloomberg.  Currency Impact  “We are watching the yen’s moves carefully,”
Bridgestone’s Chief Executive Officer  Masaaki Tsuya  said today
in Tokyo.  A 1 yen decline in the Japanese currency’s value against
the dollar adds about 3.9 billion yen, and about 900 million yen
versus the euro, to Bridgestone’s operating profit, Eto said.  Bridgestone  gained  2.8 percent to close at 2,555 yen in
Tokyo before the earnings announcement. The shares have climbed
15 percent this year, compared with a 9.7 percent gain for the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Sales will probably surge 17 percent this year to 3.55
trillion yen, according to the statement.  Tsuya, 60, said today he will double as chairman after
 Shoshi Arakawa , 68, leaves his post March 26 over health
concerns.  To contact the reporters on this story:
