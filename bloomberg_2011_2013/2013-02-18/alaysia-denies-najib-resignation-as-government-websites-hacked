Malaysia’s Information Department
said hackers placed fake statements on two government websites
claiming Prime Minister  Najib Razak  had resigned.  The statements have been removed from the department’s e-
Media and e-Press websites normally used to distribute official
government announcements, Ibrahim Abdul Rahman, the unit’s
director-general, said by phone.  “I am going to make an official police report,” Ibrahim
said. “We’re still unable to access the sites till now.”  The suspected hacking comes as Najib prepares to call a
general election that will determine whether his National Front
coalition can extend its 55-year grip on power. The benchmark
 FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  has fallen 4.2 percent after
reaching a record on Jan. 7 on concern over the poll outcome.  Najib, 59, must dissolve parliament by April 28 for an
election to be held within 60 days. The governing National Front
won the 2008 vote by its narrowest margin since the Southeast
Asian nation’s independence in 1957.  About 200 government websites were disabled in June 2011
after hackers threatened to sabotage portals to protest a
clampdown on Internet file-sharing sites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
