LLX Logistica SA , the port developer
of billionaire  Eike Batista , led gains on the Bovespa  index 
today after announcing an agreement with ASCO Group Ltd. to
provide services at its Acu complex in Rio de Janeiro.  LLX  rose  1.5 percent to 2.04 reais at 1:58 p.m. in Sao
Paulo today after advancing as much as 4 percent. The stock,
which traded at 40 percent of the three-month daily average
volume, was the best performer on Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa
index, which  fell  0.5 percent.  Aberdeen, Scotland-based ASCO will provide logistics
services for oil exploration and production companies at the Acu
port in Rio’s state, LLX  said  in a statement today. Any
agreement to assist in developing LLX’s port project is a plus
for the stock, according to Leonardo Brito, an equity analyst at
hedge fund Teorica Investimentos.  “The company is still pre-operational and depends on
contracts for its future development,” he said in a telephone
interview from Rio. “It’s positive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
