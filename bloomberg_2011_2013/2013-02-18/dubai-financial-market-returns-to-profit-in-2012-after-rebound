Dubai Financial Market PJSC,  the
only publicly traded Gulf Arab bourse, said it returned to
profit in 2012 as trading volume in the Persian Gulf business
hub rebounded and the measure rallied the most in the region.  Profit for the year was  35.2 million dirhams  ($9.6 million)
after a loss of 6.9 million dirhams in 2011, the company said in
an e-mailed statement today. That missed the 47.6 million-dirham
 median estimate  of three analysts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Full-year revenue rose 8.2 percent to 191 million
dirhams.  “DFM company is heading into a new phase of development
and growth thanks to the thriving economic climate” in Dubai,
said chairman  Abdul Jalil Darwish .  Dubai’s benchmark  DFM General Index  was the best performer
in the Gulf Cooperation Council in 2012, with an advance of 20
percent compared with a gain of 3.7 percent for the region’s
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Index.  The average daily trading volume last
year was 60 percent higher than in 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The measure extended its rally in January with a
gain of 16 percent, the best start of the year on record.  The rally is being buttressed by a recovery in Dubai, whose
economy may have expanded 5 percent in 2012, the fastest pace
since 2007, according to government estimates. Property prices
in the emirate, home to the world’s tallest skyscraper, rose in
some neighborhoods last year after the crash sent them tumbling
more than 60 percent from mid-2008 peaks.  Dubai Financial Market  shares  were unchanged at 1.2 dirhams
in Dubai trading today, valuing the company at 9.6 billion
dirhams. The United Arab Emirates, the second-biggest Arab
economy, has three equities bourses, Nasdaq Dubai, Dubai
Financial Market and Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
