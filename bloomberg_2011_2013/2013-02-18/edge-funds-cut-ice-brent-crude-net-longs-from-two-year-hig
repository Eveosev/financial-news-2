Hedge funds and other money managers
reduced  bullish bets  on Brent crude from their highest level in
more than two years, the first cut in a month, according to data
from ICE Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will increase, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 192,154 lots in
the week ended Feb. 12, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitment of Traders report. While that’s little
changed from 192,195 a week earlier, the reduction of 41 lots is
the first decline since Jan. 15.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 237,289, down
4.8 percent from with 249,350 a week earlier. It’s the first
decrease in their net-short position in nine weeks.  Swaps dealers were net-long 71,054 contracts, down 7.8
percent from 77,029 a week earlier and the biggest weekly
reduction since Dec. 18.  Brent rose 1.8 percent on the ICE exchange in the week to
Feb. 12, settling that day at $118.66 a barrel. Brent traded at
$117.72 as of 12:31 p.m. London time today.  Money managers’  net-long bets  on gasoil rose for an eighth
week to 106,358 contracts, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
