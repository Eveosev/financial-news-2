Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai fell in the first trading session after a week-long
holiday, pacing declines in copper on global markets during the
past week.  Rebar for delivery in October, the most-active contract by
volume, fell by as much as 1.8 percent to 4,198 yuan ($672) a
metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, before trading at
4,200 at 10:40 a.m. local time. The Chinese bourse was closed
last week for the Lunar New Year holiday.  “Declines in the base metals, especially in the bellwether
copper, during last week, led to bearish sentiment in the rebar
market today,”  Wang Yaoyao , analyst at Huawen Futures Co., said
by phone from Shanghai.  Copper for three-month delivery traded in London fell by
1.1 percent in the week ended Feb. 15. LME zinc for three-month
delivery also fell by 1.4 percent in the same period.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery was unchanged at $155.10 a
ton on Feb. 15, according to a price index compiled by The Steel
Index Ltd. The average spot  price  for rebar was at 3,790 yuan a
ton on Feb. 6, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
