Mitt Romney’s  political strategist,
 Stuart Stevens , largely a recluse since the Nov. 6 presidential
election, resurfaced on a Sunday talk show. He may want to go
back into hibernation.  On the ABC News program, “ This Week  With George
Stephanopoulos,” Stevens acknowledged that Romney had a problem
with  Hispanic voters . He suggested, however, that it had little
to do with the position Romney took in the Republican primaries.  Romney lost the Hispanic vote to President  Barack Obama , 71
percent to 27 percent, and did even worse among Asian-Americans,
according to the election-day exit poll of voters.  During the Republican primaries, Romney staked out the most
anti-immigrant posture. He assailed his major opponents -- Texas
Governor  Rick Perry , former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  and
former Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum  -- as being too soft
on immigration issues. He also called on undocumented immigrants
to “ self-deport .”  Stevens said the major factor in the lopsided Obama victory
among Hispanics was the president’s health-care measure,
“because an extraordinary percentage of Hispanic voters are
uninsured.” He didn’t mention that his candidate’s attacks on
Obamacare may have contributed, too.  ( Albert R. Hunt  is a Bloomberg View columnist. Follow him on
