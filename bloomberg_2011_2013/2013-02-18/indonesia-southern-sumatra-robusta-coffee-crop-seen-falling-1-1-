The robusta coffee crop in southern
Sumatra, Indonesia’s main growing area, will be 1.1 percent
smaller in the 2013-14 season compared with a year earlier,
according to Amsterdam-based trader  Nedcoffee BV .  Output in the area will be about 335,000 metric tons in
2013-14, the trader, which has a factory in Lampung, Indonesia,
said in a report e-mailed today. Coffee production in the whole
of Indonesia, the third-biggest robusta grower, reached a three-
year high in 2012-13 as the crop recovered from too much rain
the previous year, data from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
showed. The 2013-14 season there will start in April.  “The weather in the coffee-growing areas is still
favorable for the development of the beans,” Nedcoffee said in
the report, referring to the southern Sumatra robusta coffee
crop. “Every day rain falls in the afternoon and night and
sunshine during daytime is giving the right balance between
dryness and moisture level for the coffee bean to grow.”  In Vietnam, the world’s top robusta grower, farmers sold
about 50 percent of their crop before the Tet holidays, which
mark the country’s Lunar New Year and ended yesterday, Nedcoffee
estimates. Local prices were at 40,800 dong ($1.96) a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) on Feb. 6, before the holidays,  data  from the
Daklak Trade & Tourism Center on Bloomberg showed.  “It is expected that it would take 42,000 dong a kilogram
to trigger selling again,” the trader, which also has offices
in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, said in the report.  Vietnam still has 1 million tons of coffee to export and
almost 260,000 tons are already in traders’ warehouses,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
