A cotton industry focus group will
meet Feb. 25 to discuss proposals for a new world contract,
according to the International Cotton Association.  The group, made up of producers, mills, traders, brokers
and controllers, unanimously agreed in a Jan. 28 meeting that
“the trade needed a world cotton contract,” the Liverpool,
England-based ICA said in a statement dated Feb. 14. Discussions
will continue at the group’s meeting next week.  Price volatility since 2008 has spurred “substantial”
contract disputes in the industry and “highlighted weaknesses
in current trading practices,” according to the statement.  Cotton futures trade on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
