Indonesia’s rupiah forwards fell for
a third day after the nation’s current-account deficit widened
to a record last quarter. Government bonds were steady.  Contracts to buy the currency in a month touched a one-week
low today after the central bank said Feb. 13 the  shortfall  was
$7.8 billion in the three months through December, the most
since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1989. The full-year
deficit may be 2.5 percent to 2.6 percent of gross domestic
product in 2013, compared with 2.7 percent in 2012, Bank
Indonesia Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said Feb. 15.  “The current account has been a concern but I expect it to
improve from here,” said  Billie Fuliangsahar , the head of
treasury at PT Rabobank International Indonesia in Jakarta.
“The rupiah is trading near its fair value considering its
fundamentals, and it has limited room to strengthen.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the rupiah fell 0.2
percent to 9,702 per dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in Jakarta, the
weakest level since Feb. 8, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts traded at a 0.2 percent discount to the
spot rate, which declined 0.1 percent to 9,682, prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. Non-deliverable forwards
are settled in dollars.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was
set at 9,676 today by the Association of Banks in Singapore,
compared with 9,681 on Feb. 15.  The rupiah’s one-month implied volatility, which measures
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.5 percent for an 11th day.  Overseas investors have added 3.3 trillion rupiah ($341
million) to their sovereign debt holdings this month through
Feb. 14, more than in any entire month since November, finance
ministry data show.  The yield on Indonesia’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
was little changed at 5.26 percent, the lowest level since Feb.
