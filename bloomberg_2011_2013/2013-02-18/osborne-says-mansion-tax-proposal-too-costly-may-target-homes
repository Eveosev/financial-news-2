U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  reiterated his opposition to a tax on houses
worth more than 2 million pounds ($3.1 million), saying it was
costly to implement and may target people’s homes rather than
the rich.  The opposition Labour Party said it will call a
parliamentary vote on the proposal, which it wants to introduce
to pay for a new 10 percent income-tax band for low earners. The
levy was originally a policy suggested by the government’s
Liberal Democrat coalition partners, before being taken up by
Labour leader Ed Miliband.  “It’s very costly to implement,” Osborne told ITV Plc’s
“The Agenda” program today. “Either it’s a tax con and the
money comes from somewhere else or it’s soon a homes tax and
they say it’s a mansion tax before the election and then very
quickly it becomes a homes tax on many people who are not living
in mansions at all.”  Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg , the leader of the Liberal
Democrats, said this month he had been unable to persuade his
Conservative coalition partners to adopt the so-called “mansion
tax” proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
