Investcorp SA,  the Bahrain-based
investment company with $11.5 billion of assets under
management, bought a controlling stake in oil and gas services
provider Hydrasun in a deal valued at as much as $300 million.  Investcorp acquired the stake from Equistone Partners
Europe Ltd. for between $150 million and $300 million, Mohammed
Al-Shroogi, the company’s president for Gulf business, told
reporters in Dubai today. Aberdeen, Scotland-based Hydrasun
provides hydraulic equipment and fluid connectors for the
offshore oil and gas industry.  Investcorp, with investments in companies such as Armacell
GmbH and Georg Jensen A/S, is making the acquisition through its
Gulf Opportunity Fund. Chief Executive Officer  Nemir Kirdar  said
last month the company had a “record deal flow for acquisitions
as well as exits” in the six months ended Dec. 31 and last year
completed the sale of FleetPride to TPG for more than $1
billion.  “Over the past 12 months Investcorp has done $1.5 billion
of deals in the U.S., Europe and Middle East and North Africa,”
Al-Shroogi said.  “We’re now discussing whether to launch
another fund or to do more deal-by-deal investments.”  Investcorp last month sold CCC Information Services Inc. to
private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP, while acquiring
a majority stake in FishNet Security Inc. from Lake Capital. The
company’s profit for the six months ended Dec. 31 climbed to
$39.2 million from $5.2 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
