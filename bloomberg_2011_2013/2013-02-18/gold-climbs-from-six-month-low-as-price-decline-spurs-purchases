Gold swung between gains and losses
near a six-month low as investors weighed signs of improving
economic growth against speculation that the biggest weekly drop
since May will spur purchases. Platinum rose as rubber bullets
were used in a clash at an Anglo American Platinum Ltd. mine.  Bullion dropped 3.4 percent last week and holdings in gold-
backed exchange-traded products fell the most since July in the
period on growing confidence that the global economy is
strengthening. Billionaire investor  George Soros  cut his gold
ETP holdings last quarter, government filings showed last week.
UBS AG said in a report today that its gold flows to India, the
top buyer, were above average after the sell-off, and Morgan
Stanley said it expects “bargain hunting” this week.  “In the face of increasingly positive economic data and
good stock market yields, the zero returns of gold and silver
are looking more and more unattractive,”  David Govett , head of
precious metals at Marex Spectron Group in London, wrote in a
report today. “Gold has been meandering aimlessly for a while
now and needed a move one way or the other to wash out a lot of
stale positions. We have seen the return of the Asian market and
some physical buying, albeit light.”  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.1 percent to $1,607.94
an ounce by 4:50 p.m. in London. Prices lost as much as 0.2
percent after rising 0.5 percent earlier today, and slid to
$1,598.23 on Feb. 15, the lowest since Aug. 15. Futures for
April delivery were 0.1 percent lower at $1,607.40 on the Comex
in New York.  U.S. financial markets are shut today for the Presidents’
Day holiday. Futures trading volume was 42 percent lower than
the average in the past 100 days for this time of day. Volume
for gold of 99.99 percent purity on the Shanghai Gold Exchange
exceeded 22,000 kilograms (22 metric tons) today for the first
time, according to data tracked by Bloomberg. Markets in Asia
were closed last week for the Lunar New Year holiday.  Gold Fixing  Bullion at the afternoon “fixing,” used by some mining
companies to sell output, was at $1,610.75 in London, little
changed from $1,611.25 this morning.  Holdings in gold  ETP s fell 0.5 percent to 2,602.3 tons last
week, and are now 1.1 percent below the Dec. 20 record, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Soros reduced his investment in the
SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest fund backed by the metal, by 55
percent as of Dec. 31 from three months earlier. Paulson & Co.,
the largest investor, kept its stake unchanged, a filing showed.  Silver for immediate delivery rose 0.3 percent to $29.8894
an ounce, after reaching a six-week low of $29.6912 on Feb. 15.
Palladium added 0.6 percent to $762.74 an ounce. Platinum was up
0.6 percent at $1,691 an ounce, after rising as much as 1.1
percent to $1,698.75.  Anglo American Platinum, the biggest producer of the metal,
said nine workers were shot with rubber bullets by security
guards and three guards were hurt in fighting between rival
labor groups at its South African Siphumelele mine in
Rustenburg. There were no fatalities and the injured employees
received medical attention, the company said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
