The European Investment Bank may
lend 850 million euros ($1.1 billion) to an offshore wind farm
in northwest England being developed by Dong Energy A/S and
Iberdrola SA.  The West of Duddon Sands project in the Irish Sea will cost
1.7 billion euros to build, according to a statement today on
the Luxembourg-based bank’s website. The 389-megawatt venture,
with 108 turbines, will power 300,000 U.K. homes when operating
from 2014, Danish utility Dong’s website shows.  The loan must be approved by the EIB board and a finance
contract signed before funds can be handed out, according to the
bank’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
