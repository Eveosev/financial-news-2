Farmers in Brazil’s Mato Grosso
state gathered fewer soybeans than expected from the first 10
percent of the area harvested, researcher Instituto Mato-
Grossense de Economia Agropecuaria forecast.  Production was an estimated 2.37 million metric tons from
about 790,000 hectares (1.95 million acres) cut, compared with
an estimate for 2.41 million tons based on expected average
yields, Cuiaba, Brazil-based IMEA wrote in an online  report .
Mato Grosso is the country’s largest soybean producer.  Adverse weather in parts of the state, particularly in the
west, hampered plant development and lowered productivity, while
excess moisture for early soybeans resulted in reduced quality
due to damaged beans, according to IMEA.  “The continuation of the rains could result in more losses
from the state, mainly due to a lack of uniformity of the grain
and damage,” the researcher wrote.  Productivity for this season’s later-cycle soybeans tends
to compensate for early harvest losses, IMEA said, citing
agents.  Based on the smaller-than-expected early harvest, Mato
Grosso’s total soybean production may turn out to be 24.09
million tons, compared with a previous estimate of 24.13 million
tons, IMEA wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
