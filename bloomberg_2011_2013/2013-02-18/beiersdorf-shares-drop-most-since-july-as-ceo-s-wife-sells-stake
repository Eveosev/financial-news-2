Beiersdorf AG  fell as much as 3
percent in Frankfurt trading, the most in almost seven months,
after the wife of Chief Executive Officer  Stefan Heidenreich 
sold her  entire stake  in the maker of Nivea skin cream.  Ellen-Brigitta Heidenreich sold 103,185 shares at 65.87
euros ($87.92) each on Feb. 15, raising 6.8 million euros, the
Hamburg-based company said in a statement today.  “It’s a big amount,”  Sebastian Frericks , an analyst at
Bankhaus Metzler, said by phone. “Stefan Heidenreich is in for
the long run, so it’s a bit surprising to see her sell her whole
stake. It may signal the stock is a bit too expensive.”  Beiersdorf  was down 2.4 percent at 64.20 euros as of 4:45
p.m. in Frankfurt, the  steepest drop  in the benchmark DAX Index.  The shares trade at almost 27 times estimated earnings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with almost 22
times for French competitor L’Oreal SA and about 17 times for
Unilever, the world’s second-biggest consumer-goods company.  Stefan Heidenreich, who joined Beiersdorf in January 2012,
is instituting a program of product innovation, particularly in
faster-growing  emerging markets , to keep revenue growing as
European consumers rein in spending amid the region’s debt
crisis. The company last week reported the strongest sales
growth since 2008, boosted by demand in Brazil and other
emerging markets. Revenue rose 7.2 percent to a record 6.04
billion euros in 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
