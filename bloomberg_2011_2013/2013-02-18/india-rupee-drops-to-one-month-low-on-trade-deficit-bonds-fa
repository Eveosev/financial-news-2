India’s rupee rose, reversing
earlier losses, on speculation exporters sold their overseas
earnings after the currency dropped to a one-month low.
Government bonds were little changed.  India will auction 666.69 billion rupees ($12.3 billion) of
permits to enable foreign investors to buy Indian bonds on Feb.
20, according to a notice on Securities and Exchange Board of
India website. The rupee has lost 0.7 percent against the dollar
since Feb. 13, after official data showed the trade deficit
widened to $20 billion in January, close to October’s all-time
high of $21.9 billion.  “Exporters were probably selling dollars as the rupee has
weakened a bit recently due to trade deficit concerns,” said
Vikas Babu, a currency trader at state-owned Andhra Bank in
Mumbai. “The sale of debt quotas should help attract foreign
inflows and support the local currency.”  The rupee rose 0.1 percent to 54.20 per dollar in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
54.4450 earlier, the weakest level since Jan. 17. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, rose 20 basis points, or 0.2
percentage point, to 9.25 percent.  Bond and rupee markets will be shut in Mumbai tomorrow for
a local holiday.  Asia’s third-largest  economy  will expand 5 percent in the
fiscal year ending March 31, compared with 6.2 percent in the
prior 12 months, the Central Statistical Office said Feb. 7.
 Wholesale prices  rose 6.62 percent last month from a year
earlier, official data showed last week, the slowest pace since
November 2009.  ‘Rupee Positive’  Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said Feb. 16
inflation risks will limit the extent he can reduce interest
rates to bolster an economy forecast to expand at the weakest
pace in a decade.  “Subbarao expressed hope that growth has bottomed out and
confirmed rate cut room but also said that it was limited,”
Credit Agricole CIB analysts, including Hong Kong-based Mitul
Kotecha wrote in a research note today. “Overall, the comments
should be rupee positive and we believe that the recent
correction of the currency may well be coming to an end.”  The Reserve Bank of India cut the benchmark repurchase rate
by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent last month, the first
reduction since April 2012.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 was
little changed at 7.83 percent, according to the central bank’s
trading system.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.32 per
dollar, compared with 55.20 on Feb. 15, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.21 versus 55.09. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
