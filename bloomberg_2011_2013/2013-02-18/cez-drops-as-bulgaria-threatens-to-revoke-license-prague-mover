CEZ AS  fell for a fourth day after
the Bulgarian government said it may revoke the Czech utility’s
power-distribution license in the southeast European country.  The stock slid 0.5 percent to 616 koruna by 11:03 a.m. in
Prague, adding to a 3 percent retreat in the previous three
days. CEZ underperformed a 0.1 percent gain for the  PX  index.  Bulgaria will decide in several days whether a finding by a
regulator that CEZ violated public-procurement rules is enough
to revoke the company’s license, the Sofia-based Energy, Economy
and Tourism Ministry said on its website yesterday. CEZ had 9.9
percent of its 2011 revenue from Bulgaria, making it the
company’s second-biggest market after the Czech Republic.  “The loss of license is equal to the loss of business,”
analysts led by  Milan Vanicek  and J&T Banka AS in Prague wrote
in a report to clients today.  Separately, Czech police have been inquiring into CEZ
business deals, including the 2012 sale of a stake in coal
company Mibrag, Barbora Pulpanova, a company spokeswoman, said
in e-mailed comments today, confirming a report in the Mlada
Fronta Dnes newspaper.  CEZ shares have  dropped  9.4 percent in 2013, compared with
a 3.4 percent decline by the PX index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on CEZ’s 2021 Eurobonds fell
three basis points today, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.56
percent, the least since Jan. 25, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
