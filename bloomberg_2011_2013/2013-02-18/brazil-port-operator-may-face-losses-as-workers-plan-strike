Brazil’s  Santos Brasil Participacoes
SA , the country’s largest shipping-container operator, faces as
much as 2 million reais ($1.02 million) in losses from a half-
day strike against a government port set for Feb. 22.  Workers at the Santos port will walk off the job for six
hours, according to  Paulo Pereira  da Silva, federal deputy and
president of the Forca Sindical labor federation. Santos, the
port-operations company, stands to lose as much as 4 million
reais a day from work stoppages, according to chief commercial
officer  Mauro Salgado .  Port union leaders in Brazil, the largest exporter of sugar
and orange juice, are protesting government plans to cede
control of as many as 95 terminals to private operators.
President  Dilma Rousseff  has instructed officials to resist
union pressure and continue with plans, which aim to attract
54.2 billion reais in private port investments and help jump-
start an economy that grew at the slowest pace among major
emerging markets last year.  Changing port ownership will lead to worker firings and
worsening labor conditions, labor union leaders say. Government
plans will improve ports by introducing new competition,
according to Chief of Staff  Gleisi Hoffmann .  Government and labor union representatives are scheduled to
hold talks on Feb. 22.  The world’s second-largest emerging market grew 1 percent
last year, according to the central bank. That’s down from 2.7
percent in 2011 and 7.5 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
