The European Union threatened to
expand tariffs on steel pipes from China to curb import
competition for EU producers.  The EU opened an inquiry into whether Chinese makers of
seamless pipes and tubes that have an external diameter
exceeding 406.4 millimeters (16 inches) and that aren’t made of
stainless steel sell them in the 27-nation bloc below cost, a
practice known as dumping.  The EU already imposes anti-dumping duties on imports of
Chinese seamless pipes and tubes with an external diameter not
exceeding 406.4 millimeters and of stainless steel seamless
pipes and tubes. Those two sets of levies, imposed in 2009 and
2011, respectively, after dumping probes, were meant to aid EU
producers including ArcelorMittal and Salzgitter AG.  The new investigation will determine whether shipments from
China are “being dumped and whether the dumped imports have
caused injury” to the EU industry, the European Commission, the
bloc’s trade authority in Brussels, said on Feb. 16 in the
 Official Journal . The commission has nine months to decide
whether to impose provisional anti-dumping duties for half a
year and EU governments have 15 months to decide whether to
apply “definitive” levies for five years.  The probe stems from a Jan. 3 dumping complaint by an
industry group on behalf of producers that account for more than
25 percent of the EU’s output of seamless pipes and tubes that
have an external diameter exceeding 406.4 millimeters and that
aren’t made of stainless steel, said the commission, which
didn’t identify any companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
