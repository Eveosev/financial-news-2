Malaysia’s ringgit dropped the most
in more than two weeks as investors focus on an upcoming general
election, with polls showing the popularity of Prime Minister
Najib Razak declined.  The premier must dissolve parliament by April 28 and is
aiming to restore a two-thirds majority for his coalition party
lost in 2008. His approval rating dropped to a 16-month low in
December, according to a January report from Malaysia’s Merdeka
Center for Opinion Research. Parliament will be dissolved
“very, very soon,” local news agency Bernama reported last
week, citing Najib.  The ringgit depreciated 0.7 percent to 3.0988 per dollar as
of 5:05 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the biggest decline since Jan. 31. It has
dropped 2.8 percent over the past month, the second-worst
performance among Asia’s 11 most-active currencies.  “General election concern is the ringgit’s biggest
driver,” said  Azmi Shukri Rahman , a foreign-exchange trader in
Kuala Lumpur at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. “The Malaysian
currency could test 3.12 by the end of this week.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, fell 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 7.3 percent.  A government report on Feb. 20 may show the  economy 
expanded 5.5 percent in the last three months of 2012 compared
with 5.2 percent in the preceding quarter, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Najib, who has embarked on economic and government
transformation programs since 2010, saw his popularity rating
fall to 63 percent in December from 65 percent a month earlier,
according to Merdeka.  Government bonds declined. The yield on the 3.418 percent
notes maturing in August 2022 increased one basis point to 3.49
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The rate has dropped four
basis points this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
