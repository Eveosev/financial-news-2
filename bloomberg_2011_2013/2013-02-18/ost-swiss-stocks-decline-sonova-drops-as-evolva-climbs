Most  stocks in Switzerland  declined,
trimming gains that drove the benchmark Swiss Market Index last
week to the highest level since June 2008.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
brand, fell 0.9 percent. Sulzer AG rose for a 10th day, posting
the longest winning streak since September 2009. Evolva Holding

increase” in 2013.  The SMI slipped less than 0.1 percent to 7,497.23 at the
close of trading in Zurich, as 11 stocks dropped and six
advanced. The gauge has rallied  9.9 percent  this year as the
Swiss franc depreciated against the euro. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also lost less than 0.1 percent today.  “It’s very quiet on the company front,”  Roland Schuermann , a trader at Luzerner Kantonalbank AG in Lucerne,
wrote in a note to clients today. “The U.S. markets are closed
for Presidents’ Day and hence we’ll experience a quiet start
into the week.”  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 53 percent lower than the average during the past 30 days,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Richemont lost 70 centimes to 75.20 francs after Berenberg
Bank AG said European luxury companies may be hurt by “mega-
brand fatigue” shown in relatively weak sales at LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA and Richemont’s Cartier watches.  Sulzer, Evolva  Sulzer, a Swiss pump maker, gained 2.2 percent to 161

expects 2013 revenue of between 10 million francs ($10.8
million) and 13 million francs.  Nobel Biocare Holding AG gained 3.2 percent to 9.93 francs
after  Oskar Ronner , an investor in the world’s second-biggest
dental-implant maker, abandoned an attempt to win three seats on
the board following the rejection of two of his nominees. Nobel
disagreed with his view that the company needs to review its
strategy, in particular whether it should focus on more
expensive implants or low-cost products, he said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
