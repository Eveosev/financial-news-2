Compensation payouts to U.K. bank
customers who were wrongly sold payment-protection insurance
dropped to the lowest level in 14 months in December, the
Financial Services Authority said.  Lenders paid about 360 million pounds ($557 million) in
December, the least since October 2011, the London-based
regulator said in a statement on its website today. Monthly
payouts hit a high of 735 million pounds in May, the data show.
In all, lenders have paid out 8.4 billion pounds in redress.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc  and  Barclays Plc  are among U.K.
lenders the regulator has ordered to compensate clients who were
sold insurance on loans unnecessarily or without their
knowledge. Britain’s four biggest lenders have set aside almost
11 billion pounds to cover the claims.  “We may be approaching saturation point for new claims,”
said  Jason Napier , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London who
estimates Lloyds will have to set aside a further 500 million
pounds and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  another 400 million
pounds for PPI when they report full-year earnings. “PPI
payouts are slowing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
