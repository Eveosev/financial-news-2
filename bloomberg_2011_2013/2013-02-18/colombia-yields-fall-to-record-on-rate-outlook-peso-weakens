Colombia’s peso bond yields fell to
a record on mounting speculation the central bank will lower the
benchmark interest rate at least once more this year to buoy
growth in the Andean country.  The yield on the government’s 9.25 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in May 2014 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 4.07 percent at the close of trading in Bogota,
according to the central bank. That’s the lowest on a closing
basis since the securities were issued in 2009.  Yields have fallen 18 basis points since a Feb. 5 report
showed annual inflation slowed to 2 percent in January, the
lowest level since April 2010 and at the bottom of the central
bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target range. Policy makers will
lower the key rate 25 basis points to 3.75 percent at a Feb. 22
meeting, according to 21 of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Two forecast the rate will remain unchanged.  “The market is pricing in additional cuts beyond this
week,” said Juan Camilo Cruz, an analyst at Alianza Valores
brokerage in Bogota.  Banco de la Republica has trimmed the  overnight lending
rate  1.25 percentage points since June to 4 percent. Cruz
forecasts the central bank will cut the overnight lending rate
to 3.25 percent in the first half and then raise it to 3.75
percent by year-end.  Yields on the bonds due in 2014 will fall to 3.98 percent,
according to Cruz.  South America’s third-biggest economy grew 2.1 percent in
the third quarter, less than half the 4.9 percent rate in the
prior three months and the slowest pace in the Andean region.  The peso depreciated 0.3 percent to 1,791.10 per U.S.
dollar, according to the stock exchange’s electronic currency
transactions system, known as SET-FX. Because of the U.S.
holiday, Colombia’s currency trades in the next-day market, in
which payment and delivery are made the following trading day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
