Kloeckner & Co. SE , Europe’s largest
independent steel trader, said Interfer Holding GmbH increased
its voting rights in the company.  Interfer Holding, based in Dortmund, Germany, increased its
voting rights to 7.82 percent from less than 3 percent,
according to a statement from Kloeckner today. Interfer, KIB
Vermoegensverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH, KIH
Vermoegensverwaltungsgesellschaft and Albrecht Knauf hold 7.82
percent as of today, according to the release.  Kloeckner Chief Executive Officer  Gisbert Ruehl  told
Deutsches Anleger Fernsehen in January that the company’s
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
will rise to at least 190 million euros ($253.7 million) this
year as cost cuts are taking effect. Ruehl sees “hope” for a
recovery in demand starting in the second half and an increase
in 2014, driven by China and the U.S., he told DAF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
