The Western Conference won the
National Basketball Association’s All-Star Game for the third
straight year, defeating the East 143-138 behind a game-high 30
points from  Kevin Durant  of the Oklahoma City Thunder.  Point guard  Chris Paul  of the Los Angeles Clippers added 20
points and 15 assists for the West in winning the All-Star
Game’s Most Valuable Player award last night in Houston.  Magic Johnson  and  Isiah Thomas  were the only other players in NBA
history to record 20 points and 15 assists in an All-Star Game.  “All these great players I had an opportunity to play
with, it’s an honor and privilege,” Paul said in the post-game
award ceremony at the Toyota Center.  Blake Griffin  of the Clippers scored 19 points for the
West, which has won four of the past five All-Star Games, while
 James Harden  of the Houston Rockets had 15 points and  Russell Westbrook  of the Thunder chipped in with 14.  Kobe Bryant  of the Los Angeles Lakers, the all-time leading
scorer in All-Star history, finished with nine points and eight
assists for the winning team. The players from the Western
Conference squad each got $35,000 for the win.  Carmelo Anthony  of the New York Knicks had 26 points and 12
rebounds to lead the Eastern Conference.  Dwyane Wade  added 21
points while Miami Heat teammate  LeBron James  had 19 points and
 Paul George  of the Indiana Pacers scored 17 for the East.  James hit 7-of-18 shots -- 39 percent -- after shooting
under 40 percent in only one game during the first half of the
regular season, according to ESPN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
