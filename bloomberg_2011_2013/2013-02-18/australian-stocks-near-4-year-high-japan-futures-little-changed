Japanese stock futures were little
changed and Australian equities traded near the highest level in
more than four years as investors awaited minutes from recent
meetings at the Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of Australia.  Gree Inc.  may climb after the game-site operator headed by
Japan’s youngest billionaire said it will buy back as much as 1
percent of its stock.  APN News & Media Ltd.  slumped 12 percent
in Sydney after its chairman and chief executive officer
resigned in a dispute with the publisher’s largest shareholder
over plans to sell stock and reduce debt.  Bridgestone Corp. 
shares may move in Tokyo as it forecast sales and profit above
analyst estimates. Asciano Ltd. gained 4 percent as profit at
the Australian transport services provider increased.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring next
month closed at 11,400 in Chicago yesterday, down from the
11,410 closing level yesterday in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in
the pre-market at 11,410 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2 percent.  “The central bank minutes will be very interesting,” said
 Evan Lucas , Melbourne-based market strategist at IG Markets
Ltd., a provider of trading services. “The fear of missing out
on this rally is overtaking.”  Japan and Australia are the two best-performing developed
equity markets in Asia, with the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
gaining 9.7 percent this year through yesterday. The S&P/ASX 200
Index advanced 8.9 percent in 2013 through yesterday, closing at
the highest level since Sept. 8, 2008.  Bank Minutes  The Bank of Japan is scheduled to release at 8:50 a.m. in
Tokyo minutes of its January meeting when the bank agreed to set
a 2 percent inflation target and start open-ended asset
purchases in 2014. The Reserve Bank of Australia will post
minutes from its February meeting at 11:30 a.m. Sydney time. The
Australian central bank will keep its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at next month’s meeting, according to economists
forecast by Bloomberg.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.8 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.3
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Of the 337 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have  reported quarterly earnings  and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 51 percent exceeded profit expectations. That
compares with 71 percent of S&P 500 companies that topped profit
forecasts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. U.S. equity markets will reopen today after the
Presidents’s Day Holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
