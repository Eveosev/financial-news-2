Royal Dutch Shell Plc  will move its
Singapore office to a neighborhood in the west of the city-state
in the first quarter of 2014.  The company, whose Singapore refinery is its biggest
globally, will relocate to Buona Vista from its current location
in the central area of River Valley, Serene Loo, a company
spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement.  “This move will allow us to bring our office staff under
one roof and to enable us to cater for the company’s future
growth in Singapore,” Loo said.  Shell plans to move its natural-gas business to Singapore
from The Hague in response to to growing demand for liquefied
natural gas in Asia, the company said in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
