Yugoimport SPDR, Serbia’s biggest
defense company, and a unit of  Emirates Advance Investments
Group  signed a contract to develop light cruise missiles in the
Balkan country.  Yugoimport , based in Belgrade, agreed the deal with
Emirates Advanced Research and Technology Holding LLC, or Earth,
in Abu Dhabi today which may lead to “joint production and
deliveries of large quantities” of missiles and related
equipment, Serbia’s Defense Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement. The contract is worth more than 200 million euros
($267 million), with an initial 24 million euros from the Abu
Dhabi-based company due within weeks, the government said on its
 website .  Production of the missiles, with a range of as much as 60
kilometers (38 miles), will involve Serbia’s arms maker  Krusik 
and aircraft manufacturer Utva, the defense ministry said.  Serbia and the United Arab Emirates yesterday signed
agreements on strategic partnership, protection of mutual
investments and defense cooperation. The Balkan country has
sought multibillion-euro investment from the Gulf state,
including in agriculture and information technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
