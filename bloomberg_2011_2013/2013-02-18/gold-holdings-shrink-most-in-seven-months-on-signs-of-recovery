Gold holdings in exchange-traded
products shrank by the most in seven months as data in the U.S.
added to signs that a global economic recovery is strengthening,
eroding demand for haven investments.  Assets  contracted 0.5 percent last week, the biggest such
decline since July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
holdings, which reached a record in December, dropped to a
three-month low of 2,602.335 metric tons on Feb. 15. Billionaire
investors  George Soros  and Louis Moore Bacon cut their stakes in
gold ETPs last quarter, while  John Paulson  maintained his share,
government filings showed last week.  Analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Credit Suisse
Group AG are calling for gold to peak in 2013 after a 12-year
bull run as the global economy rebounds. Manufacturing in the
New York region unexpectedly expanded in February, and consumer
confidence rose to a three-month high, separate reports showed
last week. China’s economy may expand 8.1 percent this year from
7.9 percent in 2012, according to the median of analysts’
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s still early days to declare that we’re out of the
economic doldrums, however, with data showing signs of
improvement, investors would rather put their money into riskier
assets,” said  Sun Yonggang , a macroeconomic strategist at
Everbright Futures Co., a unit of one of China’s largest state-
owned investment companies.  Gold for April delivery gained as much as 0.6 percent to
$1,618.80 an ounce, and traded at $1,617.60 at 10:31 a.m. in
Singapore. The metal slumped to $1,596.70 on Feb. 15, the
cheapest since August.  Bets by hedge funds and other large speculators on higher
prices tumbled to the lowest since December 2008 in the week to
Feb. 12, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.  Bullion has fallen 3.5 percent this year, lagging behind
gains in platinum and palladium as faster economic growth drives
demand for the metals used mainly in industry amid concern about
lower supplies. Platinum’s premium to gold widened to an almost
18-month high last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
