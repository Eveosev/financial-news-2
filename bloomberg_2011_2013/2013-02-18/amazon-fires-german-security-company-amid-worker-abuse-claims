Amazon.com Inc ., the world’s largest
online retailer, fired a security company in Germany over
alleged abuse of workers.  Amazon confirmed today it ended its business relationship
with security company Hensel European Security Services. The
company was criticized in a program by German television channel
ARD last week for mistreating temporary workers at a German
logistics center.  “The criticized security service is not used any longer,”
Ulrike Stoecker, a Munich-based spokeswoman for Amazon in
Germany, said in an e-mail. “Amazon has zero-tolerance for
discrimination and intimidation.” Amazon employs about 8,000
workers in logistics, she said.  HESS security staff allegedly harassed temporary workers
and searched their rooms, according to the ARD report. The job
seekers, mainly from eastern Europe and Spain, were attracted to
work at the Bad Hersfeld logistics center by recruiting
companies, ARD said on its website, referring to a program it
showed last week. The workers also suffered from poor salaries
and temporary, crowded housing in holiday villages.  Security personnel who allegedly harassed foreign workers
were linked to neo-Nazi groups, ARD said.  Hensel European Security denied any connection with far-
right radicalism, a company official said, referring to an
earlier statement from Chief Executive Officer Patrick Hensel.  The German government will examine the activities of a
temporary-employment company that provides personnel to
Amazon.com, Labor Ministry spokeswoman Christina Wendt said. The
company’s license could be revoked if any wrongdoing is found,
she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
