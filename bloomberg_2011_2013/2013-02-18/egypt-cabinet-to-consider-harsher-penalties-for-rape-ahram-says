The Egyptian government is
considering changes that will toughen sexual assault and torture
laws, state-run Ahram newspaper reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  The changes would give life sentences to kidnappers, and
death sentences to rapists, Ahram reported. Public officials
that torture, or order psychological or physical torture, would
be sentenced to hard labor, Ahram said.  The same sentences will be handed down to those who
witnessed a crime and didn’t report it, or had the ability to
stop the crime and didn’t act, Ahram reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
