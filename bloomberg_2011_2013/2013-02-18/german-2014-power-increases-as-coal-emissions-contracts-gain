Power for delivery next year in
Germany, Europeâ€™s biggest market, rose for the first time in
three days as the cost of carbon emissions and coal climbed.  Baseload German 2014 electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock rose as much as 40 cents to 42.80 euros
($57.11) a megawatt-hour and was at 42.75 euros at 5:13 p.m. in
Berlin, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp in
2014 increased 0.5 percent to $99 a metric ton in its first gain
in seven days, while European Union emissions allowances for
December rose as much as 6.4 percent to 5.52 euros a ton on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. Power can track emissions
and coal prices, which affect production costs.  March power in Germany climbed as much as 2.2 percent to
39.45 euros a megawatt-hour.  Temperatures in Frankfurt may rise as high as 10 degrees
Celsius (50 Fahrenheit) in the first week of March compared with
a low of zero degrees today, according to CustomWeather Inc.
data on Bloomberg.  Wind output in Germany is predicted to rise to about 5
gigawatts tomorrow, Meteologica SA, a Madrid-based weather
forecaster, said on its website. That compares with an average
level of 4.85 gigawatts, according to data from EEX on
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marek Strzelecki in
