Former  WestLB AG  Chief Executive
Officer  Juergen Sengera  settled charges in Germany that he
approved a faulty loan to consumer-electronics company Box
Clever.  Sengera agreed to pay 100,000 euros ($133,600) to charities
to have the case dropped, the Dusseldorf Regional Court said in
an e-mailed statement today. While the former bank executive was
acquitted of the charges in 2008, Germany’s highest criminal
court later overturned that decision on appeal and ordered a
retrial.  The judges approved the settlement “mainly because the 70-
year-old accused has no criminal record,” the court said in the
statement. “He didn’t enrich himself. The action happened many
years ago.”  Sengera was charged with breach of trust over WestLB’s
approval in 1999 of a 1.35 billion-euro loan to Box Clever. The
company, created by the merger of the television rental
businesses of Nomura Holdings Inc. and Granada Plc, became
insolvent in 2003, leading to losses at the bank of about 427
million euros, prosecutors have said.  Eberhard Kempf , who represented Sengera in the 2008 case,
didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
