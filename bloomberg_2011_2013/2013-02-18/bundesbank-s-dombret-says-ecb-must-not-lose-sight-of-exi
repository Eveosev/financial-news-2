Bundesbank board member  Andreas Dombret  said the European Central Bank must begin to withdraw
its emergency policy measures as soon as an exit is justified,
and warned that leaving interest rates low for too long can fuel
asset-price bubbles.  “Monetary policy cannot lose sight of the exit from
extraordinary measures and must act when an exit is warranted,”
Dombret said in a speech in Hamburg today. Banks shouldn’t rely
on low interest rates and policy makers should remember the
risks inherent in cheap credit, he said.  Germany’s central bank has opposed the ECB’s latest efforts
to battle Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, such as the
announcement of a bond-buying program. Dombret said the
Bundesbank will continue to advocate that the right incentives
are set.  “Extraordinary monetary-policy measures are no substitute
for the budget consolidation and structural reforms that are
necessary for a lasting solution to the crisis,” he said.  Dombret also warned that leaving interest rates low for too
long can lead to “exaggerations” in asset prices and cited
rising property prices in some parts of Germany.  While there may not be a German-wide property-price bubble
at the moment, it should be remembered that it was the
“bursting of the price bubble on the U.S. mortgage market that
triggered the worldwide financial crisis,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
