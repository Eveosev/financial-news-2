Thailand’s baht fell for a third day
after the Group of 20 nations refrained from censuring Japanese
policies that have weakened the yen, causing the dollar to
strengthen against most Asian currencies.  The yen extended its loss against the dollar this year to
8.4 percent, while the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against the currencies of six major trading partners, advanced
for a third day. Thailand’s gross domestic product increased
18.9 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a revised 3.1
percent gain in the previous three months, according to official
data today. The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for a 15.3 percent expansion.  “With the G-20 past, the weaker yen trend is back and the
dollar is rising broadly in the region,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a
researcher at the Japan Center for Economic Research in Tokyo.
“The scenario of strong growth in Thailand is still here,
providing underlying support for the baht.”  The baht declined 0.2 percent to 29.91 per dollar as of
3:14 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 29.94 earlier, the weakest level since Feb. 11. The
baht has gained 2.3 percent this year. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 5.27 percent.  Thailand’s economy expanded 6.4 percent in 2012, compared
with 0.1 percent in 2011, today’s data show. Thailand sees
export growth for this year at 11 percent, Arkhom
Termpittayapaisith, secretary-general of the National Economic
and Social Development Board, said today.  “Export growth represents inflows, which is supportive of
the baht,” said Frances Cheung, a strategist at Credit Agricole
CIB in Hong Kong. “But risk is the weaker yen. So, the baht may
remain stable in coming months.”  The baht has started to stabilize after strengthening
earlier in 2013, Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn
Trairatvorakul said Feb. 14. The central bank is ready to take
measures “if the baht is distorted,” he said Jan. 31.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 fell two basis points to 3.63 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
