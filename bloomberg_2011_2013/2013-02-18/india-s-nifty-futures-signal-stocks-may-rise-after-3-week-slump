Indian  stocks rebounded after three
weeks of declines. Lenders and energy companies climbed.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index , or Sensex, rose 0.2 percent
to 19,497.84, according to preliminary closing prices. Volumes
on the gauge were 27 percent less than the 30-day average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Housing Development Finance Corp .,
the biggest mortgage lender, rose to a one-month high.  Reliance
Industries Ltd ., the owner of the world’s largest oil-refining
complex and the second-largest stock on the Sensex, gained for
the first time in three days.  Finance Minister  Palaniappan Chidambaram , who unveils the
annual budget on Feb. 28, has vowed spending cut curbs to avert
a credit rating downgrade and damp inflation, part of a wider
policy overhaul since September to revive an economy expanding
at the weakest pace in a decade. The Sensex is down 3 percent
from a two-year high on Jan. 25 even as foreign funds plowed a
net $7.85 billion into local stocks this year, the most among
the 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
