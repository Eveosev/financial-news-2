Rubber rose from the largest weekly
loss since November as Japan’s currency weakened, boosting the
appeal of the yen-denominated commodity used in tires and gloves.  The contract for July delivery gained as much as 1.8
percent to 327.2 yen a kilogram ($3,479 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange and was at 325.6 yen at 11:37 a.m.
Futures fell 2.7 percent last week, the most since the week
through Nov. 9.  Asian stocks rose as the yen dropped after the Group of 20
nations refrained from censuring Japan’s currency policy, while
signaling that the country has scope to keep stimulating its
stagnant economy as long as policy makers cease publicly
advocating a sliding yen.  “The weakening yen is supportive to rubber markets,”
 Chaiwat Muenmee , an analyst at DS Futures Co., said by phone
from Bangkok. Chinese buyers may increase purchases after
returning from Lunar New Year holidays last week, he said.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 0.9 percent to 26,480 yuan ($4,243) a ton as trade
resumed. Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.3 percent to 97.45
baht ($3.26) a kilogram on Feb. 15, according to the Rubber
Research Institute of Thailand.  Thailand has spent 22 billion baht buying 198,000 tons from
farmers above market rates to boost local prices, Yuttapong
Charasathien, deputy farm minister, said last week. The National
Rubber Policy Committee approved spending a further 5 billion
baht and has no immediate plan to sell stockpiles, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
