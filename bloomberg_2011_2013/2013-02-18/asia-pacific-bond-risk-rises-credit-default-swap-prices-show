The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 1.5 basis
points to 115 basis points as of 11:33 a.m. in Sydney, according
to Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The gauge is headed for its
second straight daily rise after falling to its lowest in more
than a month at 112.5 on Feb. 14, according to data provider
CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose one basis point to 111.5 as of 8:10
a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices. The benchmark is set to pare its drop this month to five
basis points, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 2.5 basis points to
121.5 as of 9:18 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
measure ended last month at 135.2, according to CMA data.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
