The ruble rose against the central
bank’s target basket, approaching the regulator’s intervention
zone as exporters sold foreign currency to pay taxes.  The Russian currency rose 0.1 percent versus Bank Rossii’s
dollar-euro basket to 34.6541 by 11.30 a.m. in Moscow. The ruble
was little changed against the dollar at 30.1300.  Companies are selling dollars and euros and buying local
currency to pay excise duties due today. Bank Rossii spent $46
million buying dollars and euros on Feb. 14 when the ruble
strengthened beyond 34.65 for the first time since Jan. 25, the
regulator said  on its website  today. Crude, the country’s main
export earner, rose 0.1 percent to $117.73 a barrel in London.  “Despite the global volatility, the market disposition is
determined to a large degree by internal flows,”  ING Groep NV 
analyst  Dmitry Polevoy  said in an e-mailed note.  The yield on Russian government notes due 2027 rose one
basis point to 7.07 percent.  “The ruble is holding to its current positions only thanks
to exporters and their currency selling,”  Ruslan Tongiev , head
of financial markets operations at Promsvyazbank, said by phone.
“Their offer will end later, and the ruble will partially give
up its position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
