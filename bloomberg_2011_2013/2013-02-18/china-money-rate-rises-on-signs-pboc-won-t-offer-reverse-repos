China’s money-market rate rose on
speculation the central bank will refrain from adding funds to
the financial system this week to prevent an overheating of the
nation’s property market.  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for sales this
week of 28- and 91-day repurchase contracts, which drain money
from markets, and not for reverse-repo agreements, according to
a trader required to bid at the auctions. In a report on Feb. 6,
the PBOC signaled inflation and the housing market remain
concerns and said it will maintain a prudent monetary policy.  “The central bank will probably conduct only repo
operations this week because there is so much money in the
banking system,” said He Weisheng, a Shanghai-based strategist
at Citigroup Inc. “The PBOC is probably concerned about
overheating risks in the property market.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed two basis points to 2.94 percent
as of 10:25 a.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted average
rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. China’s
interbank bond market reopened on Feb. 16 after the weeklong
Lunar New year holiday.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was steady at
3.13 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.55 percent government bonds due December
2022 increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.58 percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
