Italy’s cereal imports fell 17
percent in the first 11 months of 2012 on lower purchases of
wheat and corn, cutting the country’s grain-import bill,
industry group Associazione Nazionale Cerealisti said.  Grain and cereal-product imports fell to 9.77 million
metric tons with a value of 2.89 billion euros ($3.9 billion)
from January through to November, from 11.8 million tons and
3.34 billion euros in the year-earlier period, the Rome-based
group wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Italy is Europe’s largest wheat importer, trade data show.
Italians ate an average 26 kilograms (57 pounds) of pasta per
capita in 2011, about triple U.S. per-capita consumption,
according to the International Pasta Organisation.  Soft-wheat imports fell to 3.95 million tons with a price
tag of 965 million euros in the period, from 4.79 million tons
bought for 1.17 billion euros a year earlier, Anacer reported.
Buying of durum wheat, the hard variety used for pasta, fell to
1.41 million tons worth 426 million euros, from 2.11 million
tons and 597 million euros.  Corn-import volume declined to 2.26 million tons from 2.42
million tons, while the value fell to 538 million euros from 560
million euros, according to Anacer.  Including spending on oilseed and protein-crop products,
the value of Italy’s imports dropped to 4.38 billion euros from
4.76 billion euros.  Italy’s 11-month cereal-industry exports amounted to 2.68
billion euros from 2.66 billion euros a year earlier, Anacer
reported. Pasta exports rose to 1.5 billion euros from 1.38
billion euros. Italy is the world’s biggest maker of the
foodstuff, according to the pasta organization.  The country’s grain-trade deficit shrunk to 1.7 billion
euros from the year-earlier shortfall of 2.1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
