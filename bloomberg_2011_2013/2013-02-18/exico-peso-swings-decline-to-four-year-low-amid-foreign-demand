Swings in Mexico’s peso are tumbling
to a four-year low as foreign investors pour money into the
country’s higher-yielding assets, supporting the currency.  Three-month historical volatility, which measures the
magnitude of the peso’s fluctuations over the period, declined
for a fifth day, falling to 7.76 percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico
City, the lowest closing level since September 2008, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency was little changed
at 12.6854 per U.S. dollar.  Volatility in the peso has been falling as global investors
seek the country’s higher yields amid mounting speculation that
policy makers may reduce the country’s target lending rate as
soon as next month. The most recent data from the central bank
shows the percentage of fixed-rate government bonds held by
foreigners earlier this month remained near a 13-year high of 55
percent.  Flows have been “very significant,”  Rafael Camarena , an
economist at  Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB , said in a
telephone interview. “The increase of bonds in the hands of
foreigners was very high.”  Yields on peso-denominated bonds due in 2024 declined one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.09 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.15
centavo to 143.63 centavos per peso. Yields on the debt maturing
this December was little changed at 4.26 percent.  Mexico’s economy accelerated more than analysts forecast in
the fourth quarter, led by growth in agriculture and services
growth, lifting annual growth to 3.9 percent for 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
