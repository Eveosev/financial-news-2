The fire on  Carnival Corp.’s  cruise
ship Triumph was caused by a leak in a fuel oil return line, the
U.S. Coast Guard said.  The U.S. investigation of the causes of the incident and
the crew’s response to the fire will last about six months,
Lieutenant Commander Teresa Hatfield, the Coast Guard’s Marine
Casualty Investigation team leader, said during a conference
call with reporters today.  The ship, which left Galveston, Texas, on Feb. 7 with more
than 3,100 guests, caught fire Feb. 10 off the coast of Mexico
and arrived in Mobile, Alabama on Feb. 14, after being stranded
for four days. The Coast Guard will also try to find out why the
ship remained disabled for so long, Hatfield said.  As of last week, a total of 14 Triumph voyages through
April 13 had been canceled. Carnival, based in Miami, has said
the incident will reduce earnings in the first half of fiscal
2013 by 8 cents to 10 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
