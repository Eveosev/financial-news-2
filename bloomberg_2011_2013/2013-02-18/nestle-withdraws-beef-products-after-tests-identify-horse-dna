Nestle SA , the world’s largest food
company, is withdrawing some beef ravioli and beef tortellini
products and suspended deliveries after food tested positive for
horse DNA.  Nestle is removing the chilled pasta foods in Italy and
Spain immediately and replacing them with 100 percent beef
products, the Vevey, Switzerland-based company said in a
statement today. Nestle has for now also stopped all deliveries
of products with beef from H.J. Schypke, a subcontractor of
Nestle supplier JBS Toledo NV.  “The levels found are above the 1 percent threshold the
U.K.’s Food Safety Agency uses to indicate likely adulteration
or gross negligence,” according to the statement. “There is no
food safety issue, but the mislabeling of products means they
fail to meet the very high standards consumers expect from us.”  Nestle is the latest food company in Europe to be engulfed
by the horse meat scandal which started in Ireland in mid-
January. Retailers across the region have withdrawn products
such as frozen beef burgers, lasagnas and meat balls from the
shelves and the European Union has ordered immediate testing
across the bloc for equine DNA in beef products and the
veterinary drug phenylbutazone in horse meat.  Nestle said it has also withdrawn a frozen lasagna produced
in France for the catering industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
