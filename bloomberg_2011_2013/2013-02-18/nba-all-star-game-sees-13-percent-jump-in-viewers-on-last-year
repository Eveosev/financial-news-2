This year’s National Basketball
Association All-Star Game was viewed by an average of 8 million
viewers, a 13 percent increase on the 2012 telecast.  Last year’s midseason showcase, held in Orlando, was seen
by 7.1 million total viewers, Turner Sports said yesterday in an
e-mailed release citing Nielsen Media Research.  Players representing the Western Conference beat their
Eastern Conference counterparts 143-138 at the Toyota Center in
Houston two days ago. Los Angeles Clippers guard  Chris Paul  had
20 points and 15 assists for the West and was named the game’s
Most Valuable Player. New York Knicks forward  Carmelo Anthony 
led the East with 26 points.  The Western Conference’s third straight win was seen in an
average of 4.6 percent of U.S. households on the TNT network, up
from a 4.4 rating last year and down from a 5.2 rating in 2011
that was the highest since  Michael Jordan ’s final appearance in
an All-Star Game in 2003.  This year’s game garnered the highest local ratings in
Miami, home of the defending NBA-champion Heat, followed by San
Antonio and Memphis, according to the release.  -- Editors: Erik Matuszewski, Dan Baynes  To contact the reporter on this story:
