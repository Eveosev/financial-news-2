Saudi Arabia boosted its average
crude oil exports last year to the highest level since 2005,
while Iraq and Kuwait shipped the most in at least a decade,
according to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative.  Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, exported 7.41 million barrels a
day on average in 2012, up 5.2 percent from 2011, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on monthly data from the
initiative. Last year’s shipments were the highest since the
kingdom’s exports averaged 7.47 million a day in 2005, the data
showed.  Iraq, OPEC’s second biggest-producer, shipped 2.43 million
barrels a day on average last year, while Kuwait’s exports
averaged 2.07 million a day, the data posted yesterday on the
initiative’s website showed. These were highest averages for
both producers since the initiative, known as JODI, began
compiling data.  Saudi Arabia increased shipments last year to make up for
supply shortfalls from Libya, Iran, and other exporters and
moderate increases in global crude prices. Saudi Oil Minister
 Ali al-Naimi  said in Australia last May that he wanted to see
the price for Brent crude at around $100 a barrel. Brent, a
benchmark for more than half the world’s crude, is trading today
in London at close to $117.70 a barrel.  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, uses statistics supplied by national governments to
compile data on production, imports and exports for oil-
producing and consuming nations. The data include crude oil and
condensates and exclude natural gas liquids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
