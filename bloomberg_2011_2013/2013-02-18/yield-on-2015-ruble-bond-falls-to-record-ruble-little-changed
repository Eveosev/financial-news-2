Yields on Russia’s short-dated
ruble bonds fell to record lows, as investors switched into them
from the longer maturities that the government focuses on
offering at primary auctions.  The yield on the OFZ due in June 2015 fell by one basis
point to 5.99 percent. The  ruble  rose 0.1 percent against the
central bank’s target basket of dollars and euros to 34.6637 by
7 p.m.  “Short and mid-dated notes have always enjoyed more
investment demand, and their volatility is insignificant,”
 Alexander Nikonov , head of fixed income at Region Broker Co.
LLC, said by e-mail.  The Finance Ministry began to focus on supplying bonds with
terms of five to 15 years at weekly auctions last year to
lengthen the average maturity of outstanding ruble debt. The
government will offer 20 billion rubles ($664 million) of seven-
year debt and 9.92 billion rubles of 15-year debt at sales on
Feb. 20, according to the ministry’s  preliminary schedule  for
the first quarter.  Yields on the OFZ due in February 2027 rose for the fourth
session out of last five to reach 7.1 percent, the highest since
Jan. 8. Selling in the bond may have been due to the auction
this week,  Olga Sterina , an analyst at UralSib Financial Corp,
in Moscow, said by e-mail.  While Euroclear Bank SA began direct settlement of over-
the-counter transactions with Russian government ruble debt on
Feb. 7, the country last week had its worst auction for longer-
maturity bonds since this year’s first sale. The government sold
10.7 billion rubles of 10-year securities out of 25 billion
rubles offered.  Selling pressure on longer-dated bonds is due to their
“speculative nature,” Region’s Nikonov said. “The admission
of OFZs to Euroclear as a trade idea has already been played
out”.  The ruble was little changed against the dollar at 30.1345
at 7 p.m. in Moscow. Crude oil, the country’s main export
earner, fell 0.1 percent to $117.56 a barrel in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
