Heathrow Airport Ltd.  said Europe’s
busiest aviation hub risks losing equity investors should U.K.
regulators fail to approve proposals to spend 3 billion pounds
($4.7 billion) on the facility in the five years to 2019.  “Shareholders will only invest if they foresee a fair
return and clearly there hasn’t been a fair return in the
current five-year period,” Chief Executive Officer  Colin Matthews  said in a telephone interview today. “It’s very
important there is in the next.”  Investment in the period starting April 2014 will cover the
completion of Heathrow’s new Terminal 2 facility, additional
taxiways and a retooled baggage system, the airport operator
said on Feb. 12. The U.K.’s Civil Aviation Authority, which sets
the maximum amount Heathrow is allowed to charge airlines, must
approve the plan before it goes into effect.  Adjusted pretax profit totaled 46.4 million pounds last
year, compared with a loss of 166.7 million pounds in 2011,
while sales rose 8.1 percent to 2.46 billion pounds, the London-
based company said in a statement today. Capital spending
totaled 1.16 billion pounds, including 1.14 billion pounds at
Heathrow and 16 million pounds on Stansted airport in northeast
London, a business the company has sold.  Heathrow shareholders received a 240 million-pound dividend
in 2012, the first since Spanish builder  Ferrovial SA  led a
group of investors that bought the airport operator in 2006. The
total payout figure amounted to 436 million pounds, including
loan interest and 99 million pounds in cash that was returned to
the group, Heathrow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
