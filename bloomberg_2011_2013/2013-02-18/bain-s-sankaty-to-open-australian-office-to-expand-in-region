Sankaty Advisors LLC, the debt-
investment unit of Bain Capital LLC, is opening an office in
Melbourne as it bolsters its operation in the Australian region.  Mitchell Stack , who joined Sankaty last year from
Australia’s A$80 billion ($83 billion) sovereign wealth fund,
will be managing director of the Melbourne office, said Andrew
Stokes, an external spokesman for Sankaty at FTI Consulting Inc.
in Sydney.  Sankaty “have actively been investing in the region for
several years and currently have several investments in
Australia and New Zealand,” Stokes said.  The unit, an affiliate of Boston-based Bain that had $18.9
billion of assets under management at Sept. 30, is seeking $1
billion for its second fund that will lend to middle-market
companies, people familiar with the matter said Feb. 7. It took
part in the debt-for-equity swap of Australia’s Alinta Energy
Holdings Pty Ltd. in 2010, according to the utility’s website.  A pullback in lending by banks and other traditional
lenders has prompted firms, including Carlyle Group LP and  KKR &
Co. , to raise first-time funds that will make loans to mid-size
businesses. Banks have been turning away from those businesses
as they face higher capital costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
