Diesel consumption in France
declined 2.1 percent last month from a year earlier, and demand
for fuel in the country may continue to fall, according to the
Union Francaise des Industries Petrolieres, an industry group.  Gasoline  demand dropped 7.7 percent in the same period, the
Paris-based group known as UFIP, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “2012 was marked by a 1.2% decline in fuel consumption in
France,”  Jean-Louis Schilansky , UFIP president, said in the
statement. “And this trend may continue based on the first
consumption data for 2013.”  Diesel prices  at the pump in France averaged 1.38 euros a
liter in January, compared with last year’s peak of 1.46 euros
at the end of August, according to European Commission data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
