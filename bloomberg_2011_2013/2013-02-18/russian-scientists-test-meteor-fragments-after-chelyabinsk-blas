More than 50 meteor fragments are
being examined after a rock from space exploded over Chelyabinsk
last week and sent shock waves across Russia’s Urals region that
shattered glass, injuring more than 1,200 people.  Scientists found 53 fragments ranging in size from 1
millimeter to 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) near Chebarkul Lake, about
80 kilometers (50 miles) from the city of Chelyabinsk, Alexei
Ishchenko, a member of the expedition from the Urals Federal
University, said by phone.  The meteor blast over the Chelyabinsk region, which has a
population of 3.6 million people, was the largest recorded since
the Tunguska event flattened more than 800 square miles (2,100
square kilometers) of Siberian forest in 1908. The object
entered the atmosphere at 9:20 a.m. local time on Feb. 15, hours
before an unrelated asteroid half the length of a football field
hurtled past the Earth.  “The fragments were found deep in the snow and ice around
the lake,” Ishchenko said. “They’re now being tested.”  Chelyabinsk police are investigating sales of meteor pieces
via websites, the Interior Ministry’s local division said in an
e-mailed statement. Supposed meteorites have been put up for
sale at prices ranging from 10,000 rubles ($330) to 500,000
rubles, according to the statement. The police are seeking the
people behind the offers.  Ice Hole  An 8-meter hole was punched through the ice on Cherbarkul
Lake. Divers failed to find pieces of meteorite under water,
Rossiya 24 reported Feb. 16.  The rocky pieces found around the lake contain about 10
percent iron, Victor Grokhovsky, a member of the Russian Academy
of Science’s meteor committee who headed the expedition,  said  in
a statement on the Urals Federal University’s website.  Before hitting the Earth’s atmosphere, the Chelyabinsk
object was about 17 meters and had a mass of about 10,000 tons,
the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a
 statement .  Most of the injuries reported in the Chelyabinsk region
were caused by flying glass, according to Governor Mikhail
Yurevich’s  website . About 200,000 square meters (50 acres) of
glass were broken by the shock when the meteor disintegrated,
with total damage estimated at 1 billion rubles, according to
the governor’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
