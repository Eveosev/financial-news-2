 Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said a “credible military threat” is needed to stop
Iran’s atomic program, the risk it poses to the flow of Middle
East oil and what he called a global wave of Iran-led terrorism.  “The sanctions alone won’t stop Iran’s nuclear program,”
Netanyahu said at a conference in Jerusalem today. “They have
to be coupled with a robust, credible military threat.” Iran
will be at the top of President  Barack Obama ’s agenda next month
when he visits Israel and the Palestinian territories, followed
by violence in Syria, Netanyahu said.  Iran faces sanctions including a European Union ban on oil
purchases and new U.S. measures this month that restrict the
Persian Gulf country’s access to cash from oil exports.  Netanyahu has called for “red lines” to be set for
military action if Iran continues to enrich uranium for what
Israel believes is a nuclear arms program. He said on Feb. 11
that Iran is accelerating efforts to enrich uranium.  The Islamic Republic says the enrichment is for civilian
use. U.S. officials have said they prefer to focus on economic
sanctions with European partners to pressure Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
