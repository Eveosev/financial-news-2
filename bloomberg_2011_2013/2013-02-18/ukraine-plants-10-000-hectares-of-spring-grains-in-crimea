Ukraine planted 10,000 hectares
(24,710 acres) of spring grains in Crimea by Feb. 15, according
to agriculture researcher UkrAgroConsult.  About 8.1 million hectares of spring grains will be planted
in Ukraine for the 2013 harvest, the Kiev-based researcher said
in an e-mailed statement today. That compares with 8 million
hectares a year earlier, according to State Statistics Office
 data .  Winter grains were in good and satisfactory condition on
about 91 percent of planted areas, UkrAgroConsult said. The
weather continues to be favorable for the crops, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
