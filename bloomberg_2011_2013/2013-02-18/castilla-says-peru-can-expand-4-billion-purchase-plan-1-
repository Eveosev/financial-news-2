Peru’s government is ready to expand
a plan to purchase $4 billion of U.S. currency to support the
central bank’s effort to slow appreciation of the sol, Finance
Minister Miguel Castilla said.  The Finance Ministry will buy at least $1 billion to
service foreign debt as part of the plan to offset increased
dollar inflows, Castilla told reporters in Lima. It will also
prepay $1.8 billion in multilateral debt and add $1.2 billion to
contingency reserves.  Peru’s foreign-currency inflows have risen amid increased
demand as investors from developed economies seek higher-
yielding assets in emerging markets, and as Peruvian companies
seek financing abroad. The central bank has boosted dollar
purchases this year and raised reserve requirements to curb
dollar supply. The Finance Ministry will coordinate its
purchases with the central bank, which has limits to how many
dollars it can buy in the currency market without stirring
inflation, Castilla said.  While the sol remains near its fundamental value versus the
dollar, the government seeks to avoid an “accelerated”
appreciation, Castilla said. The strength of the sol is a
“challenge” for the export sector, he said.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.5765 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, according to Bloomberg prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
