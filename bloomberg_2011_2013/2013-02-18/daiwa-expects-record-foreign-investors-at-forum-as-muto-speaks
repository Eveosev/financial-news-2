Daiwa Securities Group Inc.  expects
a record attendance by foreign investors at its Japanese equity
conference next month where  Toshiro Muto , a potential candidate
as the next Bank of Japan governor, is scheduled to speak.  More than 300 foreign investors registered for the event to
be held at the Prince Park Tower Tokyo from March 4 to 8,
surpassing the previous record of 234 attendees in 2011,
Hidefumi Saho, executive director of Daiwa’s corporate access
department, said by phone yesterday.  Muto  is one of three likely
governor contenders, according to Citigroup Inc.  BOJ Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  and two of his deputies are
set to step down on March 19. The yen has tumbled about 16
percent versus the dollar in the past three months as Prime
Minister  Shinzo Abe  announced spending increases and pressured
the BOJ to boost monetary easing, while the  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average  surged 26 percent.  Other speakers at the event include Rogers Holdings
Chairman  Jim Rogers  and  Shigeru Ishiba , secretary general of the
Liberal Democratic Party, according to Daiwa’s event pamphlet.
The gathering will also enable investors to interact with top
officials at companies including  Japan Exchange Group Inc. ,
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. and Japan Airlines Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
