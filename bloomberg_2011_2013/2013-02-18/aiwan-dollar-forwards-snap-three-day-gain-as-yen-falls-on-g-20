Taiwan dollar forwards fell for the
first time in four days as the yen extended losses, after the
Group of 20 nations refrained from censuring Japanese policies
driving the decline. Government bonds gained.  The yen tumbled 13 percent in the past three months as
policy makers in Japan sought to step up monetary stimulus.
Taiwan’s central bank warned on Jan. 29 that it will intervene
in the currency market if “irregular factors,” such as large
fund flows, cause excessive volatility. Taiwan and Japan compete
in the global market for electronic products.  “We expect the yen depreciation contagion will be felt
most powerfully in Korea and Taiwan due to their proximity to
Japan in distance and economic structure,” said  Tim Condon , the
Singapore-based head of Asian research at ING Groep NV. “The
contagion began to be felt in January. The yen will depreciate
further to 100 by the end of the year.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.3 percent to
NT$29.67 versus its U.S. counterpart as of 4:14 p.m. local time,
the biggest drop since Feb. 8, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Local financial markets were shut last week for the Lunar New
Year holiday.  In the spot market, the currency gained 0.1 percent to
NT$29.709 against its U.S. counterpart from Feb. 8, according to
prices from Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.752 earlier, the
weakest level since Sept. 10 .  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 10 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  Volatility Eases  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
rose 29 basis points, or 0.29 percentage point, to 5.28 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due March 2023 dropped
to 1.207 percent from 1.215 percent on Feb. 6, according to
Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.385 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
