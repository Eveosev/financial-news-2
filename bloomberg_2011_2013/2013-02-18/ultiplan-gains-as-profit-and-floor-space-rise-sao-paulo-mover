Multiplan Empreendimentos
Imobiliarios SA , Brazil’s second-biggest real estate developer
by market value, gained after the company said profit rose as it
expanded total space available to lease by 28 percent.  Shares  gained 1.3 percent to 55.42 reais at 1:47 p.m. in
Sao Paulo after earlier jumping as much as 2.1 percent in the
biggest intraday advance since Jan. 29. Volume was 70 percent of
the full-day average of the past three months. The benchmark
Bovespa index fell 0.5 percent.  Multiplan’s fourth-quarter adjusted  net income  was 128.5
million reais ($65.3 million), compared with 108.1 million a
year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The total amount
of space available to lease at its shopping malls and commercial
buildings grew to 528,000 square meters (631,483 square yards)
by the end of last year, from 411,700 square meters in 2011,
according to a statement on its website.  The increase in available space shows Multiplan “wants to
grow faster now,” analysts at  Banco Bradesco SA ’s brokerage
including  Edigimar Maximiliano  wrote in a note to clients dated
today. “We have a favorable view on this new strategy, given
the company’s proven development capabilities and high-level
portfolio,” they wrote.  The real estate company said today in a regulatory filing
that it plans to sell as many as 9 million common shares in a
primary offering. It did not set a date for the transaction.  Multiplan has soared 41 percent in the past 12 months,
while the Bovespa dropped 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
