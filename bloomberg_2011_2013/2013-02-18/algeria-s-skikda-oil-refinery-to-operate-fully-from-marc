Sonatrach, Algeria’s state-run
energy company, will resume full operations at its  Skikda 
refinery in the first week of March.  A fire that broke out on Feb. 14 delayed the restart by one
week, Abdelkader Benchouia, vice president for downstream
operations, said in an interview in Algiers. The plant has been
partially shut since last July.  The plant in eastern Algeria can process 353,000 barrels of
crude a day, according to data by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
