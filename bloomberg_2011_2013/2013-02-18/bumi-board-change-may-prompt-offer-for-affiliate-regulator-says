A Nathaniel Rothschild victory at
Bumi Plc’s meeting this week may force the company to buy out
shareholders in a subsidiary, said a commissioner at Indonesia’s
financial services regulator, the OJK.  Should Rothschild’s bid to oust the Bumi board be deemed to
constitute a change of control at  PT Bumi Resources , the
Indonesian coal company 29 percent-owned by Bumi Plc, it would
trigger a mandatory offer for the remainder of Bumi Resources’
shares, the OJK’s Nurhaida, who goes by only one name, said
today in Jakarta.  “In the event of a change of control, the capital market
regulations are clear,” she said. “The new controlling party
must conduct a tender offer.”  Rothschild has called the Feb. 21 extraordinary general
meeting in an attempt to replace 12 of the 14 directors of Bumi
Plc. An outcome in his favor would trigger the change of control
clause, according to the Bakrie Group, Rothschild’s adversary in
the battle for Bumi Plc. Rothschild is seeking to oust the
board, including its chairman and chief executive officer, while
also pursuing a separation from the Bakries, his co-founders in
the London-traded Indonesian coal company.  That would leave a new Bumi Plc board responsible for as
much as $8 billion in payments, said Bakrie spokesman Chris
Fong, citing a Relationship Agreement struck by the Bakrie Group
and the Bumi Plc board in 2010 that would allow it to name the
chairman, CEO, and chief financial officer of Bumi Plc.  Agreement ‘Irrelevant’  A new board could face “a mandatory tender offer of the
remaining shares of  Bumi Resources , which will be valued at $4
billion,” he said. “In addition, creditors will require debts
to be settled, which amounts to another $4 billion.”  The OJK’s Nurhaida didn’t say whether board changes at Bumi
Plc constitute a change of control, and she declined to comment
on any takeover price.  Rothschild said in an e-mail today that Bumi Plc has never
had control of Bumi Resources, which means that the Relationship
Agreement is irrelevant. Bumi Resources “is controlled by the
Bakries, who appoint all of its senior management, do what they
like with its assets, and ignore other shareholders,” he said.  The OJK’s Nurhaida said control is defined as an ownership
in excess of 50 percent, or having the ability to control
certain aspect of the company such as appointing directors or
management, even with a stake of less than 50 percent.  Bakrie Control  “Bakrie’s ownership is less than 50 percent, but because
there’s an agreement, Bakrie is the party in control,” she
said. “We will see if there is any change to this condition
after the EGM.”  The fight for control over Bumi Resources may boost its
share price, as both parties try to increase their voting power
in the coal producer, Frederick Daniel Tanggela, an analyst at
Trimegah Securities in Jakarta, said.  “Bumi Resources is a speculative buy,” Tanggela said by
telephone today, adding the Bakries and Rothschild may “buy the
shares in the market.” Bumi Resources shares rose 9.4 percent
to close at 930 rupiah in Jakarta Jakarta time, its highest
level since Aug. 24.  Berau President Director Rosan Roeslani’s Recapital Group
said today that it had sold its 13 percent holding in Bumi Plc.
Recapital’s 24.2 million shares had a market value of 91.3
million pounds ($141 million), based on the Feb 15 closing
price, according to Bloomberg calculations.  The Takeover Panel ruled in December that the Bakrie Group
and Roeslani’s PT Bukit Mutiara, which together controlled 50.3
percent of the voting rights in Bumi Plc, are regarded as
“acting in concert.” They must reduce those rights to less
than 30 percent by disposing of shares, it said.  Bumi Plc advanced 4 percent to 393.9 pence by 1:47 p.m. in
London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
