The involvement of the Irish central
bank in the nation’s effort to ease the burden of its financial
restructuring is problematic, Germany’s Bundesbank said.  The Irish government announced earlier this month that it
will swap so-called promissory notes used to rescue the failed
lender Anglo Irish Bank Corp. for long-term bonds with
maturities of as long as 40 years. The bonds will be held by the
Irish central bank, which can return the interest it receives
for the securities to the government.  “The procedure proves the increasingly stronger and more
problematic inter-linkage between monetary and fiscal policy in
the European monetary union,” the Bundesbank said in its
monthly report today. “The European Stability Mechanism, which
should be responsible in this regard, has been established to
provide any help to individual member states in servicing
debt.”  The accord, which the European Central Bank has “taken
note” of, will ease Ireland’s borrowing needs over the next
decade by 20 billion euros ($27 billion), Irish Prime Minister
 Enda Kenny  said in parliament on Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
