Germany’s bonds rose, with 10-year
yields falling toward the lowest in three weeks, as European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said euro-area data showed
economic weakness at the start of this year.  Italian bonds declined on speculation an election this
month will result in a hung parliament, setting back reform
measures. Spanish securities fell before the government sells as
much as 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion) of debt this week. German
government securities outperformed all their regional peers,
extending gains from last week when a report showed the euro-
area economy shrank last quarter.  “Draghi’s comments are of the same dovish tenor as his
recent statements,” said  Ralf Umlauf , a research analyst at
Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in Frankfurt. “Markets are again
pricing in the fantasy of an interest-rate cut and bunds have
risen a little bit. We don’t think there will be a cut.”  Germany’s 10-year yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.63 percent at 4:46 p.m. London time after
dropping to 1.58 percent on Feb. 8, the lowest level since Jan.
25. The 1.5 percent bund due in February 2023 rose 0.215, or
2.15 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 98.82.  The overall situation in the euro-area remains fragile,
even though the region has made “great progress” battling the
sovereign-debt crisis, Draghi told lawmakers in the European
Parliament in Brussels.  “Available indicators signal further weakness at the
beginning of 2013, with domestic demand remaining dampened,” he
said. “Even though we have yet to see sustained improvement in
the real economy,” survey indicators have confirmed a
stabilization at a low level, he said.  GDP Contracts  Euro-region  GDP  shrank 0.6 percent from the third quarter,
the biggest decline since the first three months of 2009, the
European Union’s statistics office said on Feb. 14. ECB policy
makers next meet on March 7 after leaving their benchmark rate
at a record low of 0.75 percent on Feb. 7.  Other so-called core bond markets also advanced. Austria’s
 10-year yield  dropped two basis points to 1.97 percent and
France’s fell one basis point to 2.27 percent.  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of the Netherlands and Germany,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two-
year and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Italian Bonds  Italy’s 10-year yield rose the most in a week before the
nation holds parliamentary elections on Feb. 24-25.  Front-runner  Pier Luigi Bersani  had 33.8 percent support in
an SWG Institute survey published Feb. 8, the day before Italy’s
two-week polling blackout began. That compares with 27.8 percent
for former premier  Silvio Berlusconi .  The nation’s 10-year yield climbed three basis points to
4.41 percent after rising as much as eight basis points, the
most since Feb. 6. The rate has dropped more than 2.3 percentage
points since Berlusconi offered his resignation on Nov. 8, 2011.  “Everybody is cautious in advance of the election so
Italian yields could develop higher,” said  Christian Reicherter , an analyst at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt. “All the
periphery is heading in that direction.”  Spain’s 10-year yield increased four basis points to 5.24
percent. The Madrid-based treasury will sell securities due in
2015, 2019, and 2023 on Feb. 21.  Germany is scheduled to auction 5 billion euros of 10-year
bunds on Feb. 20.  Sweden’s bonds fell after the Financial Supervisory
Authority extended a temporary floor on the discount rate used
by pension funds, damping demand for the securities.  Insurance and pension companies can keep applying a floor
to their discount rate until the end of 2013, compared with an
initial deadline of June, the FSA said.  The country’s 10-year yield climbed two basis points to
2.04 percent.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.6 percent this
year through Feb. 15, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
French securities lost 1.7 percent and Italy’s gained 1.3
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
