Gold volumes for the benchmark cash
contract on the Shanghai Gold Exchange climbed to a record today,
as the market re-opened after a weeklong break and lower prices
lured buyers.  The volume for  bullion  of 99.99 percent purity exceeded
22,000 kilograms (22 metric tons), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prices dropped 2.8 percent to 327.25 yuan a gram
($1,630.29 an ounce) as of 5:04 p.m. Singapore time. Markets
were closed last week for the Lunar New Year holiday.  “Chinese investors returned to the market today after the
holiday, and the slump in gold prices in the past week provided
great incentive for buying as many Chinese are still holding a
bullish outlook on gold,”  Qu Mingyu , a trader at Bank of China
Ltd., the nation’s fourth-largest lender by assets, said by
phone from Shanghai today.  Spot gold tumbled 3.4 percent last week, the worst such
showing since May, as improving data from the U.S. reduced the
appeal of haven assets. The metal today rebounded as much as 0.6
percent to $1,618.90 an ounce and last traded at $1,615.40.  -- Glenys Sim  and  Feiwen Rong . Editors: Ovais Subhani,  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
