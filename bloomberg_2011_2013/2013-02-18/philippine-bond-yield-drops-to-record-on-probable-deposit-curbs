The yield on Philippine government
bonds due 2019 approached a record low after central bank
Governor Amando Tetangco said authorities were considering more
measures to discourage investment in special-deposit accounts.  The yield on the notes has fallen 33 basis points since
Jan. 23, the day before Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas reduced the
interest rate on SDAs to 3 percent from more than 3.5 percent to
curb currency speculation. Policy makers will seek to
rationalize access to these accounts to keep them as a liquidity
management tool and not as an investment outlet, Tetangco said
in a speech in Manila on Feb. 15.  “There are expected revisions on the SDAs, which could
mean lower rates for retail as well as institutional
investors,” said  Lito Mercado , head of trading at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. in Manila. That “will prompt them to
look at higher-yielding assets, including long-term Philippine
bonds,” he said.  The yield on the government’s 3.875 percent bonds due
November 2019 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 3.56 percent as of 4:04 p.m. in Manila, according to prices
from Tradition Financial Services. That’s within one basis point
of the level reached on Feb. 1 that was the lowest since the
notes were issued in November 2012.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 40.622 per dollar, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency has appreciated 1 percent
this year, the third-best performance among Asia’s 11 most-
active currencies. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped eight basis points to 4.13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
