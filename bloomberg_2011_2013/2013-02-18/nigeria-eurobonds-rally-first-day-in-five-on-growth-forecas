Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobond
yields rallied for the first time in five days after a forecast
that the country’s economic growth will accelerate this year and
as foreign-exchange reserves increased.  Borrowing costs on dollar debt due January 2021 declined
three basis points to 4.370 percent as of 11:55 a.m. in London.
The naira slipped less than 0.1 percent to 157.35 a dollar.  Nigeria’s economy will probably expand 6.8 percent this year
compared with growth of 6.6 percent in 2012, the Abuja-based
 National Bureau of Statistics  said today in an e-mailed report.
The  foreign-currency reserves  of Africa’s most populous country
have advanced 6 percent this year to $46.68 billion, the highest
since at least 2010, according to Feb. 14 data compiled by the
central bank.  “With rising gross domestic product and external reserves
as well as decelerating inflation rate, the outlook for the
Nigerian economy remains favorable,” Sewa Wusu, analyst at
Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone.  The nation’s  inflation  rate fell to 9 percent in January
from 12 percent in December, the statistics bureau said today.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 declined six basis points to 10.78 percent in the
secondary market, according to Feb. 15 data compiled on the
 Financial Markets Dealers Association  website.  Ghana’s cedi declined 0.2 percent to 1.8985 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
