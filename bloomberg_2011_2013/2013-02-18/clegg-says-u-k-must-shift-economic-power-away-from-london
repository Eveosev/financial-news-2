U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  will say the economic importance of cities outside London
needs to be developed as part of Britain’s recovery.  Measures to help other cities grow would add 41 billion
pounds ($64 billion) to  gross domestic product  a year, Clegg
will say in a speech at 7 p.m. in London today, according to
extracts released by his office. London has 13 percent of the
country’s population and produces more than a fifth of its total
output, he will say.  Britain’s economy needs to reduce its reliance on the
capital and on financial services, he will say. That requires
measures such as political decentralization, so that cities and
towns have more control over their growth, instead of depending
on investment from central government.  “When the banks went bust and the money stopped flowing,
the extent of this regional dependence and underperformance was
laid bare,” Clegg will say. “The challenge for us is to
rebuild our economy so that it runs on all cylinders, tapping
into our huge potential across the country as a whole.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
