Air Berlin Plc  rose to the highest
in more than nine months after analysts at Deutsche Bank AG said
the German airline’s cost savings efforts will bear fruit.  Europe’s third-biggest discount carrier will cut 900 jobs,
almost 10 percent of the workforce, and extend fleet reductions
in a push to save 400 million euros ($534 million) by the end of
2014, the airline said in January.  The strategy known as Turbine is “the last chance for the
company – and we think it will be a success,” analysts
including  Michael Kuhn  wrote in a note to clients today. “Air
Berlin is undergoing the deepest restructuring program in the
history of the company,” Kuhn wrote. “We expect gradual
results improvements which should bring Air Berlin back into
profitability in 2014.”  The shares rose almost 11 percent to 2.09 euros, the
highest on an intraday basis since May. They traded at 2.01
euros at 11.08 a.m., up 6 percent, giving the airline a market
value of 234.7 million euros.  The analysts recommended clients buy the shares and said
they will rise in value to 3.50 euros within a year, compared
with an earlier target of 1.40 euros.  Separately, they raised their recommendation on Europe’s
second biggest airline  Deutsche Lufthansa  AG to buy from hold
and said the shares will advance to 19 euros from an earlier
target of 12.50 euros. They said they expect details on the
company’s SCORE savings program will “further support
confidence”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
