European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Ewald Nowotny  said he sees no “immediate” need
for intervening in currency markets because the euro’s exchange
rate against the dollar is in a “normal range.”  The euro’s gains against the Japanese yen are also not
dramatic, Nowotny told journalists in Vienna today. He
reiterated ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s stance that exchange
rates are only a concern if they put price stability at risk.  “The euro-dollar exchange rate is in a region we’ve had
before,” Nowotny said. “There is an appreciation of the euro
to the yen, but not to a dramatic extent. That means if it stays
as it is now, this discussion isn’t real.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
