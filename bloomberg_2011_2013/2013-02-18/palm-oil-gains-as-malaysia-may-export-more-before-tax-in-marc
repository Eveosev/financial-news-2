Palm oil advanced for the first time
in four sessions on speculation that Malaysia may boost exports
this month before a tax is imposed in March, reducing near
record inventories in the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for delivery in April, the most-active by open
interest, climbed as much as 1.5 percent to 2,519 ringgit ($813)
a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, and ended the
morning session at 2,511 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Futures
declined 3 percent last week to end at 2,483 ringgit, the lowest
price at close for most active futures since Jan. 29.  The tax on crude palm oil exports will be 4.5 percent for
March after shipments were allowed at zero duty in January and
February, according to the Customs Department. That’s less than
the 9 percent tax set for this month by Indonesia, the biggest
producer and exporter. Shipments from Malaysia climbed 18
percent to 673,555 tons in the first 15 days of February from
the same period a month ago, surveyor  Intertek  said Feb. 15.  “It’s likely that Malaysian exporters may ship out more
palm oil to take advantage of the zero percent tax,” said  Ker Chung Yang , an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte in Singapore.  The rush to export more palm oil this month may help to cut
stockpiles,  Ivy Ng , an analyst at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.,
wrote in a report today.  Inventories  in Malaysia slid 1.9
percent to 2.58 million tons last month from an all-time high of
2.63 million tons in December, the nation’s palm oil board said
Feb. 13.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September lost 0.7 percent
to 7,042 yuan ($1,128) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month dropped 0.8 percent
to 8,646 yuan a ton. Financial markets in China were closed last
week for the Lunar New Year festival.  To contact the reporter on this story:
