The won dropped for the first time
in a week as the yen’s decline following the Group of 20 nations
meeting sparked concern South Korea will step in to weaken its
currency to support exports. Government bonds gained.  The yen fell against the dollar and the won after the G-20
refrained from censuring Japanese policies that have driven the
currency’s decline. Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said
in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in Moscow that the
monetary authority will closely monitor the impact of Japan’s
policy stimulus on the South Korean economy.  “There were expectations the G-20 would comment on the
Japanese currency and that didn’t happen,” said Jeon Seung Ji,
an analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in Seoul. “That’s prompting
the drop in the won, which had gained a lot” before the
meeting, she said.  The won fell 0.4 percent to close at 1,082.10 per dollar in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It gained 1.6
percent last week, the biggest five-day advance since the period
ended Dec. 2, 2011.  One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
gained 20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage point, to 7.23
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Two days of talks between G-20 finance ministers and
central bankers ended in Moscow Feb. 16 with a statement that
pledged not to “target our exchange rates for competitive
purposes,” without singling out Japan. Bank of Korea’s Kim said
in the WSJ interview that he hopes the yen isn’t being
deliberately weakened.  Producer Prices  Against its Japanese counterpart, the South Korean currency
advanced for a third week last week. It appreciated 1.3 percent
today, the most since Feb. 4, to 11.52 per yen. A stronger won
erodes the competitiveness of exports from companies such as
Hyundai Motor Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. Finance Minister
Bahk Jae Wan said Jan. 23 the government was “all ready” to
intervene and smooth currency-market volatility as the yen
slides.  The Bank of Korea bought the U.S. currency on Feb. 15 to
prevent the won from appreciating, Marc Chandler, global head of
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., said in a
Feb. 16 research note. Improving stock market inflows may
suggest traders are beginning to recognize that officials are
indeed committed to keeping exports competitive, he wrote.  The gain in the won helped South Korea’s producer prices to
fall 1.6 percent in January from last year, the most in more
than three years, a central bank report showed today.  South Korea’s incoming President Park Geun Hye yesterday
named  Hyun Oh Seok , head of the Korea Development Institute, as
finance minister.  Economic Recovery  “The short-term challenge is how to secure a rapid
economic recovery,” Hyun said at a briefing in Seoul yesterday,
without commenting on the currency or fiscal stimulus. “The
long-term challenge is how to coordinate between growth and
welfare and improve our growth potential.”  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent notes due 2017
dropped one basis points to 2.83 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
