West Texas Intermediate oil fell for
a second day, extending the biggest drop in two weeks. Saudi
Arabia’s crude shipments slid to a 15-month low in December.  New York crude declined as much as 0.6 percent before a
scheduled trading halt for the U.S. Presidents Day holiday.
Saudi Arabia exported 7.06 million barrels of crude a day in
December, the least since September 2011, according to the Joint
Organizations Data Initiative. Saudi Arabia has ample supply and
will cut exports further,  Christof Ruehl , chief economist at BP
Plc, said in an interview from London. Brent’s premium to WTI
narrowed.  “It’s the kind of skewed situation where we have growth in
the U.S. but they have enough oil, and where we do have the
major demand growth, we don’t have the oil,”  Ole Hansen , the
head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said
in a telephone interview today. “That’s obviously putting the
upside pressure on the Brent crude more than on WTI.”  Crude for March delivery fell 31 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$95.55 a barrel at 1:14 p.m. in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract dropped $1.45 to $95.86
on Feb. 15.  The volume of all contracts traded was 80 percent below the
100-day average. Floor trading in New York is closed today for
the holiday. Electronic trading halted at 1:15 p.m. Eastern time
and will resume at 6 p.m. All electronic transactions since the
Nymex closed on Feb. 15 will be dated tomorrow.  “In such low volumes, it doesn’t take much to push WTI in
electronic trading,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an oil market
strategist with Global Commodities Research in London.  Brent Drops  Brent for April settlement on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange declined 12 cents to end the session at $117.54 a
barrel with trading volume 70 percent below the 100-day average.
The European benchmark crude was at a premium of $21.22 to WTI
contracts, more than the $21.25 on Feb. 15. The gap had expanded
to $23.18 on Feb. 8, the widest differential since Nov. 26.  Brent has gained 5.3 percent this year, while WTI has
increased 3.8 percent.  “We’ve had a strong rally so far in 2013, and now we are
considering if this is a pause in the upturn or if it is
actually a turning point, but there is no significant macro
trigger to release a correction, at least at the moment,” Filip Petersson , commodities strategist at SEB AB, a Stockholm-based
bank, said today.  U.S. output at factories, mines and utilities decreased 0.1
percent after a 0.4 percent gain in December, Fed data showed
Feb. 15 in Washington. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
called for a 0.2 percent rise.  Bullish Bets  Hedge funds and other large speculators increased bullish
bets on WTI, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s weekly report on Feb. 15. Net-long positions rose
by 9,308 futures and options combined, or 4.4 percent, to
221,534, the highest level since the week ended March 27, the
Commitments of Traders report showed.  WTI has long-term technical support along its 100-week
moving average, around $94.73 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures have halted intraday declines
near this indicator in the past four weeks. Buy orders tend to
be clustered close to chart-support levels.  “There still seems to be plenty of crude around,” said
 Anthony Nunan , a senior adviser for risk management at
Mitsubishi Corp. in Tokyo. “The market went up so much in the
last month and a half that it was bound to come off. We have to
correct downward from here. For WTI it will be tough to go to
triple digits. We’ve hit a wall at $98.”  Saudi Output  Ruehl of BP said the size of any future reduction in Saudi
output will depend on the actions of other members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Iraq , OPEC’s largest producer after Saudi Arabia, curtailed
exports by 10 percent to 2.35 million barrels a day in December,
data posted on the website of the initiative known as JODI
showed. Venezuela increased crude shipments by 19 percent to
1.97 million barrels a day, the most since July 2008, when it
exported 2.24 million. OPEC’s 12 members supplies about 40
percent of the world’s oil.  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, uses statistics supplied by national governments to
compile data on imports, exports and output for oil-producing
and consuming nations. The data include crude and condensates
and exclude natural gas liquids.  Gasoline futures extended gains in New York after settling
last week at the highest price since Sept. 28. The contract for
March delivery increased 2.36 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.1581
a gallon at 1:14 p.m., before the electronic trading halt on the
Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
