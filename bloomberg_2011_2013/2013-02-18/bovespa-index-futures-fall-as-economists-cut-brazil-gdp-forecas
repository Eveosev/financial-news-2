The Bovespa index fell to an 11-week
low as economists covering Brazil reduced their 2014 growth
forecasts, rekindling concern that a slower recovery will hurt
corporate earnings.  Retailer  B2W Cia. Global do Varejo  dropped the most in four
months, leading declines by companies that depend on domestic
demand. Steelmaker  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA 
tumbled to the lowest since Oct. 26 as metals fell amid signs of
slower growth in China. OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA was
the worst  performer  on the index, falling for a fourth day as
oil retreated.  The Bovespa declined 0.5 percent to 57,613.90, the lowest
closing level since Dec. 4. Forty-six stocks sank on the gauge
while 21 advanced. The real strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.9633
per dollar.  “If the economy takes longer than expected to recover,
we’ll probably start to see corporate earnings getting weaker
and weaker, which would mean share prices would have to go
through some adjustments,”  Clodoir Vieira , an economist at Sao
Paulo-based brokerage Souza Barros Corretora, said in a phone
interview.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 3.65 percent
next year, according to the median forecast of about 100
economists in a central bank weekly survey released today. That
compares with an estimate of 3.8 percent a week earlier. The
growth outlook is 3.08 percent for 2013, down from 3.09 percent
a week earlier.  B2W, Pao de Acucar  B2W lost 5.9 percent to 13.25 reais, the biggest one-day
drop since Oct. 18. The MSCI Brazil/Consumer Discretionary Index
slid 1 percent.  Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar ,
Brazil’s biggest retailer, climbed 0.8 percent to 95.20 reais
after it was rated buy in new coverage at Banco Espirito Santo
de Investimento SA.  Usiminas, as Usinas Siderurgicas is known, retreated 3.4
percent to 9.80 reais. The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price
 Commodity Index  tumbled 1.5 percent as a report from the
Ministry of Commerce showed that retail sales in China gained at
the slowest pace since 2009 during last week’s Lunar New Year
festival.  Real estate developer  Multiplan Empreendimentos
Imobiliarios SA  gained 1.5 percent to 55.51 reais. The company
posted adjusted net income of 128.5 million reais in the fourth
quarter, which compares with an average forecast of 95 million
reais, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  LLX Gains  LLX Logistica SA , the port developer controlled by
billionaire Eike Batista, gained 0.5 percent to 2.02 reais after
announcing an agreement with ASCO Group Ltd. to provide services
at its Acu complex in Rio de Janeiro.  The  Bovespa  has dropped 9 percent from this year’s high on
Jan. 3 amid concern that accelerating inflation may curb
Brazil’s economic recovery and that the government’s
interventionist policies will hurt profits in industries
including utilities and energy.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 10.8 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.3 for MSCI’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 5.13 billion
reais today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.46 billion reais this year
through Feb. 14, according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
