Kuwaiti lawmakers applied to
question Finance Minister  Mustafa Al-Shimali  and Oil Minister
 Hani Hussein  in parliament, the latter over alleged violations
in the oil sector.  Parliamentarian Nawaf Al-Fuzaie filed a request to question
Al-Shimali over lending practices and the relationship between
the central bank and commercial banks, the state-run  KUNA  news
agency reported. Lawmakers are pushing for a bailout of consumer
loans, and parliament is scheduled to discuss the proposal
tomorrow.  Al-Fuzaie also joined Saadoun Hammad in demanding to
question the oil minister on five issues, including alleged
breaches of a boycott on Israeli products and “irregularities
in contracts” between Kuwait’s Petrochemical Industries Co. and
 Dow Chemical Co .  Repeated clashes between lawmakers and the government have
led to a series of parliamentary dissolutions and Cabinet
resignations in Kuwait, the fourth-biggest OPEC producer. That
has contributed to slower growth and delays to key investment
projects.  Al-Shimali was reappointed finance minister in December,
almost seven months after he resigned following questioning by
the now dissolved opposition-dominated parliament.  The current legislature was elected in December amid a
boycott by the main opposition movement, which has held street
protests and rallies since late 2010 demanding more powers for
elected politicians. The new parliament, whose members have now
filed requests to question four ministers, was expected to be
more cooperative with the government than its predecessors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
