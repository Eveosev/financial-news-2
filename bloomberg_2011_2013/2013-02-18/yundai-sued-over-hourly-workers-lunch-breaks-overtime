Hyundai Motor Co . was sued in
federal court for allegedly failing to pay hourly workers at a
Philadelphia plant overtime and cheating them out of breaks.  Hyundai Rotem , a unit of the Seoul-based manufacturer,
automatically deducted 30 minutes of paid time from employee
paychecks for each shift, including shifts in which a meal break
wasn’t taken, Olivia Drake, an assembly-line worker at the
railcar-parts plant, said in a complaint filed today in
Philadelphia. The company’s actions violate federal and state
wage laws, she alleged.  Drake, who has worked for the company since May 2010,
“regularly did not take a bona-fide 30 minute uninterrupted
lunch break during weeks where she worked more than 40 hours,”
according to the lawsuit.  Hyundai Rotem also failed to pay employees for hours worked
in excess of their regular shifts, according to the complaint,
which seeks to represent employees who worked at the facility
within the last three years.  Hyundai Motor agreed in 2010 to shift deliveries of its
automobiles from New York and Baltimore to Philadelphia’s Packer
Avenue Marine Terminal. Hyundai Rotem, South Korea’s largest
railcar maker, ships chassis of rail cars to the port.  A phone message left at Hyundai Rotem in Philadelphia
seeking comment on suit wasn’t immediately returned.  The case is Drake v. Hyundai Rotem USA Corp., 13-00868,
