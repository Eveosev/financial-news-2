SM Prime Holdings Inc ., the largest
Philippine shopping mall operator, climbed to a record in Manila
stock trading after 2012 profit beat estimates.  SM Prime advanced 4.7 percent to 19.16 pesos as of 1:35
p.m. in Manila. The stock was the biggest contributor to the
gain in the benchmark  Philippine Stock Exchange Index , which
rose 0.8 percent and was poised for a record close.  Manila-based SM Prime said today its 2012 profit rose 16
percent to 10.53 billion pesos ($259 million) as it opened new
malls and same-store sales increased. The earnings exceeded the
10.43 billion peso average profit estimate of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “SM Prime beat most analysts’ forecasts so earnings
estimates are likely to be upgraded,” said  Alex Pomento , head
of research at Macquarie Group Ltd.’s Manila unit. “SM Prime
can easily beat its 2012 earnings this year because the
elections will give consumer spending an added kick.”  The Philippines will hold congressional and local polls in
May to elect half of the Senate, all members of the House of
Representatives and officers of local government units.
“Feverish” spending for election campaigns will help boost
consumer spending, Secretary Butch Abad said Dec. 19. Consumer
spending accounts for 70 percent of the $225 billion economy.  SM Prime said  sales  rose 14 percent to 30.73 billion pesos,
while profit at its malls in China increased 24 percent to 1.1
billion pesos. The company said it will open two malls and
upgrade an existing one, ending this year with 48 malls in the
Philippines and five in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
