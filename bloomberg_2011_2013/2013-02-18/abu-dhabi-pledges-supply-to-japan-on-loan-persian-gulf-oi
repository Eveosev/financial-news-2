Abu Dhabi pledged continued crude
supply to Japan after getting a $3 billion loan from a state-
linked bank in the Asian country.  Refineries in Libya and Iran are running below capacity as
the Persian Gulf country faces sanctions on its oil industry and
the North African state’s fuel-processing plants continue to
have technical faults, the International Energy Agency said.  The following is a weekly summary of Persian Gulf crude and
product market news and forthcoming events:  Crude  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. agreed to take a $3 billion loan
from Japan Bank for International Cooperation, a government
official said. JBIC, as the lender is known, is extending credit
to Abu Dhabi’s state-owned oil company, known as Adnoc, for a
five-year period, Japanese Trade Minister  Toshimitsu Motegi  said
at a press conference in the emirate Feb. 10. The loan is the
third between Adnoc and JBIC, following similar agreements in
2007 and 2010.  Qatar International Petroleum Marketing Co., or Tasweeq,
sold seven cargoes of 600,000 barrels each of Al-Shaheen crude,
according to two traders who asked not to be identified because
the information is confidential. The 4.2 million barrels for
loading in April sold at premiums of $1.20 to $1.40 a barrel to
Dubai oil, they said Feb. 15.  In regional trading, the Oman and Dubai grades both rose
for a fourth week, gaining 21 cents a barrel, or less than 1
percent, through Feb. 15.  Oman  crude futures rose to $112.70 a
barrel in the week ended Feb. 15.  Dubai  crude climbed to $112.58
in the same period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Products  Kuwait Petroleum Corp. sold 80,000 metric tons of straight-
run fuel oil to  PetroChina Co ., two people with knowledge of the
sale said. The cargo was set to be loaded Feb. 14 to Feb. 15.  Jordan Petroleum Refinery Co. is seeking to buy 500,000
metric tons of gasoil, 120,000 tons of unleaded gasoline and
210,000 tons of fuel oil. The company is accepting offers
through March 5 and didn’t specify delivery dates, according to
a statement on its website.  Refineries  Iran’s and Libya’s refineries are operating below capacity,
according to IEA estimates. Fuel-processing plants in Iran are
probably running at 85 percent of their capacity, with overall
crude runs of 1.6 million barrels a day in November, the IEA
said in its monthly oil market report on Feb. 13.  The country, under tightening U.S. and EU sanctions, is
struggling to process more crude domestically, the IEA said.
Iran, which hasn’t released data on its downstream operations
since May 2012, raised refining capacity to 2 million barrels a
day last year, the IEA said.  Libya is likely to import 3 million tons of gasoline in
2013 from Lukoil and other suppliers to meet local demand as
domestic refineries face “technical difficulties,” the IEA
said.  Iran will “soon” start operating a residual fluid
catalytic cracking unit that can refine more than 90,000 barrels
of crude a day, state-run Press TV said Feb. 11, citing Deputy
Oil Minister Alireza Zeighami. The unit at the Shazand Imam
Khomeini Refinery in central Iran is twice the size of the
world’s biggest comparable facility, which can process as much
as 45,000 barrels a day, Zeighami was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
