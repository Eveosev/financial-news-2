South African corn futures rose for
a fifth day because of a lack of rain in the country’s main
growing regions.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
gained 3.7 percent to 2,038 rand ($231) a metric ton by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg, the
longest rising streak since July 9. The yellow variety for
delivery in the same month increased 3 percent to 2,052 rand a
ton.  No rain is expected today, tomorrow and Feb. 20 in
Lichtenburg in the North West province, the second-largest
producer of corn in South Africa, according to the nation’s
 Weather Service  website.  Bothaville  in the Free State, which
produces 40 percent of the grain, will only receive rain today
and tomorrow, with nothing predicted for the rest of the week.  “The drastic increase in corn prices was caused by the
lack of rain during the weekend,”  Thys Grobbelaar , an analyst
at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone.
“A great part of our local grain is in a desperate condition
and needs rain.”  White corn is a staple food in South Africa while the
yellow variety is mainly used as animal feed. The nation is the
continent’s largest producer of corn, also known as maize.  Wheat increased 0.6 percent to 3,450 rand a ton. The nation
is a net importer of the grain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
