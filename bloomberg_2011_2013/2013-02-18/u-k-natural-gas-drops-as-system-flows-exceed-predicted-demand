U.K. natural gas for today fell as
system flows exceeded predicted demand by the most in a month,
leaving the delivery network with a surplus.  Day-ahead and next-month gas also declined, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The  delivery network  will
contain 400 million cubic meters of gas at 6 a.m. tomorrow, up
from 349 million 24 hours earlier, the biggest difference since
Jan. 18, National Grid Plc data showed earlier. Closing linepack
was predicted at 350 million cubic meters at 4:25 p.m. London
time.  Gas for today dropped 1.3 percent to 66.5 pence a therm.
 Month-ahead gas  slipped 0.3 percent to 66 pence a therm. That’s
equivalent to $10.21 per million British thermal units and
compares with $3.17 per million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Demand  in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow is forecast at
326 million cubic meters, compared with a seasonal normal of 309
million, National Grid data show. System  flows  were at 330
million cubic meters a day versus a 10-day average of 334
million, after reaching 347 million earlier today, grid data
show.  Norwegian  imports were at 124 million cubic meters a day,
after reaching 131 million, the most since Jan. 15, Gassco AS
data show.  Statoil ASA’s output will be reduced by 6.3 million cubic
meters a day tomorrow for one day after cutting production by
6.6 million cubic meters a day today, the company said on its
website.  South Morecambe gas field halted production at 3:59 p.m.
for an indefinite period of time, Centrica Plc said on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
