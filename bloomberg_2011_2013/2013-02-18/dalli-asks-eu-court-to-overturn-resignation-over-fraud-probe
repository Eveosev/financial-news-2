John Dalli , who stepped down as the
European Union’s health commissioner in October, asked an EU
court to overturn his resignation in the wake of a fraud
investigation.  Dalli is asking the EU’s General Court to  annul  an Oct. 16
“termination of office,” according to a court filing published
this week. The action wasn’t a valid resignation and didn’t
allow him to defend himself against allegations that he was
aware of attempts by a Maltese entrepreneur to sell access to
him in a possible attempt to influence the bloc’s tobacco
policy, according to the filing.  Dalli said last year that his resignation was “explicitly
demanded” by European Commission President  Jose Barroso  and
that he was refused access to a report by the EU’s anti-fraud
office, OLAF. It was “politically untenable” for Dalli to
remain in his post after the report uncovered circumstantial
evidence that he knew of the effort to sell access to him, an EU
spokesman said in October.  His resignation was the first by an EU commissioner over
corruption allegations since the entire commission resigned in
1999 after several members were accused of financial wrongdoing.
Dalli was succeeded by  Tonio Borg  as Malta’s representative at
the European Commission.  The case is: T-562/12 Dalli v Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
