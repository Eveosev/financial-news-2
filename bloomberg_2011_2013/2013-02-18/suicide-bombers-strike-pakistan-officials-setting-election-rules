Suicide bombers attacked the office
of a senior government administrator in the Pakistani city of
Peshawar as political parties discussed preparations for a May
election, killing four security personnel, Geo TV reported.  Seven people were also wounded in the attack by gunmen
disguised as members of the region’s police force, the channel
said. Local party leaders were meeting at the headquarters of
Mutahir Zeb, the top official in northwestern Khyber Agency, to
discuss the campaign code of conduct for the parliamentary poll.  One of the two bombers blew himself up as paramilitary
troops opened fire, Geo said, citing senior police official
Imran Shahid. The attack will fuel concerns militants may step
up violence before the ballot. A Feb. 16 bomb attack targeting
the country’s Shiite minority killed 84 people and wounded 225
in the southwestern city of Quetta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
