China’s yuan fell by the most in two
months after the central bank lowered the currency’s fixing amid
speculation authorities are protecting the nation’s exports
against a weak yen.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  0.04
percent weaker at 6.2816 per dollar today as trading resumed
after last week’s closure for the Lunar New Year. Global finance
chiefs at the Group of 20 nations meetings in Moscow signaled
Japan has scope to keep stimulating its economy as long as
policy makers cease publicly advocating a sliding yen, which has
dropped 8.5 percent this year.  The yuan weakened 0.16 percent from Feb. 8 to close at
6.2427 per dollar in Shanghai, prices from the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System show. That’s the biggest one-day decline
since Dec. 14. The yuan is allowed to diverge a maximum 1
percent from the daily reference rate.  “Given there aren’t any critics of Japan at the G-20, the
yen keeps weakening and that threatens Chinese exports,” said
 Bruce Yam , a foreign-exchange strategist at Sun Hung Kai
Financial Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The yuan could fall to 6.26 or
6.27 per dollar as the central bank moves to counter the impact
of a weak yen.”  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan dropped 0.24
percent, the most since Jan. 28, to 6.2335 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards fell 0.25 percent to 6.3285 per dollar, a 1.4 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, rose
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.32 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
