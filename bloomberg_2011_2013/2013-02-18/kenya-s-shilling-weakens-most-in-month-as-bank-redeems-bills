Kenya’s shilling weakened for the
first time in four days, heading for its biggest decline in
almost a month, as the central bank settled matured securities
and sold fewer repurchase agreements than it offered.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy slid 0.4
percent to 87.64 per dollar by 4:32 p.m. in Nairobi, the most in
a closing basis since Jan. 22, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Government bond redemptions of 17 billion shillings ($194
million) “came to maturity today which may have contributed”
to the currency’s depreciation,  Bernard Matimu , chief dealer at
Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd., said by phone. Some demand by
companies for dollars to pay bills may have also caused
weakness, he said.  The government accepted all 13 billion shillings of bids
for seven-day repurchase agreements at 9.434 percent, a central
bank official, who asked not to be identified in line with
policy, said by phone from Nairobi. The bank had offered 15
billion shillings of securities.  Uganda’s currency weakened for a second day, falling 0.5
percent to 2,655 per dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling declined
0.1 percent to 1,619.  To contact the reporter on this story:
