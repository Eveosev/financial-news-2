China Gogreen Assets Investment
Ltd ., a Hong Kong-based investment company, plans to invest 720
million yuan ($115 million) to develop solar power projects in
the Xuchang city in Chinaâ€™s Henan province.  Unit Beijing Jun Yang Investment Co. agreed with the
Xuchang government to develop and operate the 60 megawatts of
solar power plants on the rooftops of buildings, the company
