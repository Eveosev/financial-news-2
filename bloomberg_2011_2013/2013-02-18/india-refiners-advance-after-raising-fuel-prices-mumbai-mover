Indian Oil Corp. , the nation’s
biggest refiner, was headed for its highest close in 10 days
after increasing  fuel  prices from Feb. 16.  Indian Oil  gained  as much as 3.1 percent to 324.50 rupees,
its highest since Feb. 7, and traded up 1.6 percent as of 9:20
a.m. in Mumbai.  Bharat Petroleum Corp.  rose 2.3 percent to
388.10 rupees and  Hindustan Petroleum Corp.  2.2 percent to
317.20 rupees. The benchmark  Sensitive Index  increased 0.2
percent.  Indian Oil raised prices of diesel, the most widely used
fuel in India, by 1.1 percent to 48.16 rupees (88 U.S. cents).
The increase was the second in two months.  Gasoline  rates were
raised by 2.7 percent to 69.06 rupees a liter in New Delhi.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government last month
allowed the three refiners to raise diesel prices on their own
every month till the deficit for below-cost sales is wiped out,
as he seeks to narrow a budget deficit and avoid a rating
downgrade.  “The government is very serious about managing the fiscal
deficit and subsidy payments,” K.K. Mital, a fund manager at
Globe Capital Market Ltd., said by phone from New Delhi. “This
will help the refiners cut their losses, and ultimately benefit
the government.”  Indian Oil will continue to lose 10.27 rupees per liter on
the sale of diesel, the New Delhi-based refiner said in a Feb.
15  statement . It is losing 31.60 rupees a liter on kerosene and
481 rupees on every 14.2 kilogram bottle of liquefied petroleum
gas used for cooking.  Crude Discounts  The government orders Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and
Hindustan Petroleum to sell diesel, kerosene and cooking gas
below cost to help curb inflation. The refiners are partially
compensated by the government and state-run explorers including
 Oil & Natural Gas Corp . give discounts on the crude they sell to
the refiners. Gasoline is deregulated.  Indian Oil’s loss on fuel sales is expected to be more than
860 billion rupees in the year ending March 31, according to the
Feb. 15 statement. The three refiners together are projected to
lose 1.6 trillion rupees in the period.  Finance Minister  Palaniappan Chidambaram  is seeking to
narrow the budget deficit to 5.3 percent of gross domestic
product in the year ending March 31 from 5.8 percent last year.  India plans to trim its subsidy bill for food, fuel and
fertilizer to 1.9 trillion rupees, or 2 percent of GDP, this
financial year. The state refiners lost 738.2 billion rupees
from selling diesel below cost in the nine months ended Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
