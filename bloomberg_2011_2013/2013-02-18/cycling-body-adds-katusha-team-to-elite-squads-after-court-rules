The International Cycling Union
added the Russian Katusha team to its list of elite squads after
sports top court overuled the governing body’s decision to
exclude the team from the Tour de France and other top races.  The decision means that 19 teams will take part in the
sport’s top races, the governing body, known by its French
acronym UCI, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Katusha, whose rider Joaqium Rodriguez finished second in
last year’s Giro d’Italia, appealed UCI’s decision to a three-
person panel from the Court of Arbitration for Sport. It ruled
last week that the team should get a license for the 2013
season. It wasn’t official until UCI’s Professional Cycling
Council ruled today on adding Katusha.  UCI refused the team an elite license in December after a
probe by an auditor, giving it a second-tier license that would
have limited Katusha to lower-profile races. A CAS hearing was
held Feb. 8, and the panel decided to overturn the UCI position.
It didn’t immediately release its reasoning.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
