LCH Clearnet SA, the French arm of
Europeâ€™s biggest clearinghouse, will lower the deposits it
demands from clients to trade wheat, corn and rapeseed futures
on NYSE Liffe in Paris after prices dropped in past months.  The margin for milling wheat futures will fall to 800 euros
($1,067) per contract from 900 euros, LCH.Clearnet wrote in a
 statement  on its website Jan. 15, while those for rapeseed will
drop to 1,100 euros from 1,200 euros.  Milling wheat for March delivery has declined 8.8 percent
in the past three months in the French capital to 244.25 euros a
metric ton, while corn slumped 12 percent. Rapeseed for delivery
in May has dropped less than 1 percent.  Margin requirements for corn will drop to 750 euros from
850 euros, the clearinghouse said. The deposit for malting
barley remains at 1,250 euros.  The changes will come into effect with the margin call
tomorrow morning for positions open at the close of today,
