Blackpool hired former England
midfielder  Paul Ince  as manager, putting him in charge of a
Championship squad that includes his son Tom.  The former Liverpool, Manchester United and Inter Milan
player oversaw his first practice this morning, the English
second division club said today on its website. He has a rolling
one-year contract.  Ince, 45, played 53 times for England, and was the first
black captain. He was manager at Macclesfield Town, MK Dons,
Blackburn and Notts County, which he left in April 2011. His
son, Tom, is a 21-year-old midfielder at Blackpool.  “It’s great to be here,” Ince said on the website.
“Considering I’ve watched the team play for the last 14 months,
it’s strange sitting here as the manager, having obviously
watched Blackpool as a fan as well as watching my son play.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
