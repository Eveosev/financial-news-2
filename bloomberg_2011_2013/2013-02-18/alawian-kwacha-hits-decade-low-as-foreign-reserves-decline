 Malawi’s kwacha dropped to the
lowest in almost a decade as the Southern African country’s
foreign-exchange reserves dwindled further.  The kwacha retreated 1.7 percent to 370 a dollar at 5:18
p.m. in Lilongwe, the capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has fallen 9.5 percent this year and is at the
weakest since June 22, 1993, when Bloomberg began compiling data
on the currency.  “Liquidity in the foreign-exchange market is extremely
limited, particularly offshore, with the supply of dollars very,
very thin,”  Yvette Babb , a strategist at Standard Bank Group
Ltd. in London, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. “These
dynamics continue to exert upward pressure on the currency.”  Malawi’s foreign-currency reserves have declined 18 percent
to $192 million, or 1.01 months of import cover, since a year
earlier, according to the Reserve Bank of Malawi.  President  Joyce Banda  devalued the kwacha by a third
against the dollar a month after taking office in April to meet
conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for a
resumption of donor aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
