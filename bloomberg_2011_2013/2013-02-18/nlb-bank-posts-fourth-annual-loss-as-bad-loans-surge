Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.,
Slovenia’s biggest lender, posted a loss for a fourth
consecutive year as bad-loan provisions surged.  Net loss was 275 million euros ($367 million) in 2012 as
bad-loan provisions rose to 511 million euros, Chief Executive
Officer  Janko Medja  said at a news conference in Ljubljana
today. The bank’s net loss was 239 million euros in 2011.  “The economy is in very bad shape,” Chief Executive
Officer  Janko Medja , appointed to the top post in September,
told reporters today. “Bad loan provisions were the main reason
for our loss last year.”  The Slovenian banking industry, which last year had a
combined pretax loss of 606 million euros, is grappling with
surging bad loans as a second  recession  in three years pushes
more companies into bankruptcy, forcing lenders to set aside
record reserves. Slovenia may ask for international assistance
if the euro-region nation fails to fully implement the so-called
bad bank plan to recapitalize the ailing industry, former
Finance Minister  Janez Sustersic  said Feb. 14.  The Adriatic nation plunged into a political turmoil last
month over corruption allegations against Prime Minister  Janez Jansa , prompting two coalition partners to leave the ruling
group. Jansa vowed to continue with a minority government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
