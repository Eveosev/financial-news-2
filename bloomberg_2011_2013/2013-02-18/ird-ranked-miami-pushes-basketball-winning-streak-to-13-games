The third-ranked University of Miami
pushed its winning streak to 13 games and stayed unbeaten in
conference play by beating Clemson University 45-43 on a three-
pointer by Kenny Kadji with 34.7 seconds left.  Miami had missed 16 of its first 18 three-point attempts
yesterday in Clemson, South Carolina, before Kadjiâ€™s winning
shot. Kadji finished with 12 points to lead the Hurricanes, who

including a 12-0 mark in the Atlantic Coast Conference.  Clemson fell to 13-12 and 5-8 in the ACC.  The University of Michigan, ranked fourth in the national
polls, snapped a two-game losing streak with a 79-71 home win
over Penn State.  Trey Burke scored 29 points and Glenn Robinson III added 21
points and 10 rebounds as the Wolverines improved to 22-4,
including a 9-4 mark in the Big Ten conference.  Penn State lost its 13th straight game to fall to 8-17
