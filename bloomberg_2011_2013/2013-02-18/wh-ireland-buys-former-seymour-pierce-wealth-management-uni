WH Ireland Group Plc , a Manchester,
England-based brokerage, agreed to buy the private wealth
management arm of Seymour Pierce Ltd., a 168-year old British
stockbroker, out of administration for 25,000 pounds ($38,713).  The division has assets valued at 270 million pounds,
boosting WH Ireland’s funds managed by about 15 percent, and
generated a profit of 200,000 pounds in the year ended Sept. 30,
the firm said today in a statement.  “This transaction will add considerably to our London-
based assets under management,” Chief Executive Officer  Richard Killingbeck  said. “We expect this transaction to be earnings-
enhancing” in the current fiscal year, he said.  Seymour Pierce was placed into administration last month
and is now called Tenebris Realisations Ltd. New York-based
Cantor Fitzgerald LP agreed to buy Seymour Pierce’s corporate
finance team on Feb. 8. Like other small, independent British
stockbrokers, the London-based firm struggled with a squeeze on
revenue and fees amid Europe’s debt crisis and competition from
international firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
