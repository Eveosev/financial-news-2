NanoH2O Inc., a reverse-osmosis
membrane manufacturer for facilities that make seawater potable,
won an order for membranes used in the expansion of the
Palmachim desalination plant in Israel.  No terms were given in NanoH2O’s statement today for the
order from Via Maris Desalination Ltd., owner of the Palmachim
facility, one of the 10 largest seawater reverse-osmosis plants
in the world.  NanoH2O, based in El Segundo, California, develops
membranes used to purify water and filter salt from the sea that
lower the cost of desalination. NanoH2O’s technology stems from
research from the University of California at Los Angeles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
