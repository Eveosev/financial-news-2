A judge handling a $2 billion lawsuit
against banks including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  UBS AG (UBSN)  brought
by the former Thornburg Mortgage invited their lawyers to file
statements on the possible appointment of a mediator to resolve
the dispute, according to a federal court filing in Baltimore.  The judge, after holding a hearing on the banks’ requests
for dismissal of the suit, gave no deadline for the “brief
statements” about a mediator although he said “quickly
advised” in a handwritten note filed in court May 1.   The trustee for what is now TMST Inc. accused the banks,
including Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,
of extracting more than $700 million of margin and interest
payments from the former Thornburg by making “unjustified”
margin calls, speeding its failure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
