U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
met today with about 40 corporate and finance executives
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Lloyd Blankfein ,  Loews Corp. (L)  CEO James Tisch and  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  CEO
Kenneth Jacobs to discuss the global economy, a person who
attended the meeting said.  The executives discussed the U.S. and European economies,
housing finance, tax reform and cybersecurity at the event in
New York, the person said, asking not to be identified because
the conversation was private. The meeting was hosted by the
Partnership for New York City and Time Warner Inc. Chairman
Jeffrey Bewkes.  President Barack Obama’s relationship with Wall Street has
been rocky at times, with the president referring to “fat cat
bankers” in 2009 and his campaign last year running ads
attacking Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s record as co-founder
and CEO of Bain Capital Partners LLC.  Lew met yesterday in New York with executives including
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  CEO Jamie Dimon, billionaire hedge-fund
manager  John Paulson , Blackstone Group LP CEO Stephen Schwarzman
and CEO Leon Black of buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC.
Paulson also attended today’s meeting.  Others who participated in the discussion today include H. Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP;
Charles Kaye, co-president of Warburg Pincus LLC; Phil Kent,
chairman of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.; and Jacques Brand,
CEO for North America at Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
