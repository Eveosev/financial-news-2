Crude oil options volatility declined
as the underlying futures rallied to the highest level in a
month on a better-than-expected U.S. employment report.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 22.57 percent at 3:55 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 23.15 percent yesterday.  WTI for June delivery jumped $1.62, or 1.7 percent, to
$95.61 a barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement since April
2. The futures advanced after Labor Department data showed
nonfarm payrolls grew by 165,000 last month. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg forecast a 140,000 gain.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $85 puts with 5,833 contracts changing hands at 4 p.m. They
dropped 15 cents to 45 cents a barrel. Second-most active were
June $100 calls, which advanced 13 cents to 25 cents a barrel on
volume of 5,691 lots.  Puts, or bets that crude futures will fall, accounted for
58 percent of electronic trading volume. Bearish bets made up 57
percent of the volume of 170,540 contracts yesterday.  June $85 puts were the most-active options in the previous
session, with 7,534 lots changing hands as they dropped 28 cents
to 14 cents a barrel. June $98 calls rose 17 cents to 28 cents a
barrel on volume of 6,088 contracts.  Open interest was highest for June $80 puts with 42,293
lots. Next were December $105 calls with 38,374 and December
$110 calls with 34,148.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
