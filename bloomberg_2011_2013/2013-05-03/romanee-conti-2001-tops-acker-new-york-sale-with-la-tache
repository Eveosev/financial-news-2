Three magnums of Romanee-Conti 2001
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy were top lot at an Acker
Merrall & Condit wine auction in  New York  last week, fetching
$61,500, while a case of La Tache 1978 sold for $59,040.  Other vintages leading the April 27 sale included a three-
bottle case of Romanee-Conti 1999 DRC, which sold for $39,360,
as Domaine de la Romanee-Conti vineyards accounted for nine of
the top 10 lots at the $2.48 million auction.  Investor demand has revived after a 17-month price slide
which started in July 2011, boosting the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50
Index by 9 percent since November. The index, which fell in
April after posting four straight monthly gains, is still up
more than 5 percent on the year, partly helped by Asian buying.  “Every auction in New York has good participation from
 Hong Kong , and vice versa”  John Kapon , Acker’s Chief Executive
Officer, said in a telephone interview from New York. “There’s
definitely a bit of cross-pollination.”  The top Bordeaux at the sale was a six-bottle lot of
Chateau Petrus 1990 Pomerol, which fetched $22,140, according to
Acker. Different vintages of Petrus from years between 1990 and
2008 accounted for six of the top 25 lots in the auction.  Other leading wines in the Acker sale included Californian
estates Screaming Eagle, Sine Qua Non and Marcassin.  “We’ve noticed really good activity in  California ” and
other areas including  Spain , Kapon said. “I think we’re seeing
the market continue to diversify.”  Zachys Sale  Zachys also held a New York sale on April 25 and April 26,
selling a total $4.13 million of wine, with bidding pickup up
particularly on Bordeaux and young California wines, according
to the auction house.  Top lots at Zachys included three six-liter imperials of
 Chateau Petrus  from 2006, 2008 and 2009, which sold for a
combined $67,375.  A case of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 sold for $39,200,
12 bottles of Petrus 2009 fetched $36,750 and a similar quantity
of Chateau Latour 1961 went for $31,850.  Among Californian wines in the auction, three bottles of
Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon 2007 sold for $7,963 and six
bottles of Harlan Estate 1996 fetched $4,165.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
