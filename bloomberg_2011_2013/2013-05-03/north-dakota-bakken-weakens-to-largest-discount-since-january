Crude from the Bakken shale formation
declined to a three-month low against domestic benchmark West
Texas Intermediate.  Prices dipped even after Enbridge Inc. said crude
deliveries to the Clearbrook, Minnesota, hub were interrupted by
a shutdown of Line 81 because of a 10-gallon spill.  “If the outage is lengthy, then oil will back up into
western  North Dakota  and depress the price of Bakken at the
railhead, rather than in Clearbrook,”  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC, said in a phone interview from
Houston. Some volumes might be able to be re-routed north to
connect with the Enbridge mainline in Canada, he said.  Bakken weakened 50 cents to a discount of $4 a barrel
against WTI at 12:42 p.m. in  New York , the largest discount
since Jan. 15, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Enbridge North Dakota system runs from Plentywood,
 Montana , to Clearbrook, and the capacity of the main section
from Minot, North Dakota, to Clearbrook is 210,000 barrels a
day, according to Enbridge’s website.  “What a world we live in, that 10 gallons can close a
210,000-barrel-a-day pipeline, but I guess these days they take
a lot of precautions,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice
president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “This should not
be a long-lasting event.”  About 20 percent of oil from the Williston Basin is shipped
by pipelines, with an estimated  71 percent  carried by rail,
according to an April report from the North Dakota Pipeline
Authority.  To contact the reporters on this story:
