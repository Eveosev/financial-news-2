Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark capping its second week of gains, after the  European
Central Bank  cut  interest rates  to a record low and U.S. jobless
claims fell.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that counts Europe as its
biggest market, rose 2.4 percent. New World Development Co., a
builder controlled by billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , climbed 3.3
percent after receiving permission from Hong Kong’s bourse to
list its local hotels.  Dongfang Electric Corp. (1072) , a maker of wind-
power equipment, jumped 5.5 percent after Deutsche Bank AG
recommended buying the shares.  The Hang Seng Index climbed 0.1 percent to 22,689.96 at the
close, with two companies advancing for each that fell on the
50-member gauge. The index capped a 3.1 percent, two-week gain,
the steepest such increase since January 4 and the first back-
to-back gain since March 8.  “The Hong Kong market is trying to catch up at the
moment,” said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of Asian multi-
asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd., which manages
about $51 billion. “Whether fundamentally the cut in interest
rates in Europe will send money to Hong Kong, I don’t think so.
It helps sentiment more than anything else.”  Trading volume on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  was 22 percent less
than the 30-day intraday average. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies traded in the city
increased 0.2 percent to 10,845.99 even after data showed the
nation’s service industries expanded at a slower pace last
month.  Third Worst  The Hang Seng Index lost 4.8 percent from a Jan. 30 high
amid signs  China’s economy  is slowing as the government takes
step to restrain property-price increases, making the benchmark
index the third-worst performer among developed markets. The
measure traded at 10.8 times  estimated earnings  yesterday,
compared with a five-year average of 12.7 and the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index’s multiple of 14.5, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent
today. The measure advanced 0.9 percent yesterday after the ECB
lowered its main refinancing rate to 0.5 percent from 0.75
percent and Labor Department figures showed the number of
Americans filing claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly
dropped to the lowest level in more than five years.  Esprit rose 2.4 percent to HK$10.92, while Cosco Pacific
Ltd., which operates a port in Greece, climbed 0.8 percent to
HK$10.20.  Man Wah Holdings Ltd. (1999) , a sofa maker that gets half of
its sales from the U.S., increased 0.8 percent to HK$7.64.  New World Development rose 3.3 percent to HK$13.92, the
 biggest gain  in the Hang Seng Index. The company may seek as
much as $1 billion in a hospitality listing, two people with
knowledge of the matter said in March. New World said it hadn’t
determined how much it plans to raise through the sale.  Rating Raised  Dongfang Electric jumped 5.5 percent to HK$11.84, and
 Shanghai Electric Group Co. (2727) , China’s biggest power-equipment
maker by market value, gained 4.4 percent to HK$2.83 after
Deutsche Bank raised its rating on the companies to buy from
hold.  I.T Ltd. (999) , a Hong Kong-based fashion retailer, surged 11
percent to HK$3.20 after its full-year sales rose 15 percent
from a year earlier. The company recorded the biggest advance on
the Hang Seng Composite Index, the city’s broadest equity
measure.  Guangzhou R&F Properties Ltd. (2777) , a builder in the southern
Chinese city, gained 1 percent to HK$14.30 after its April
contract sales rose 29 percent from a year earlier.  Hang Seng Index  futures dropped 0.2 percent to 22,551. The
HSI Volatility Index slid 3 percent to 15.26, indicating traders
expect a swing of 4.4 percent for the equity benchmark in the
next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
