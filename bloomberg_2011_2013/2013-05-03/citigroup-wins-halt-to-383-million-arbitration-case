Citigroup Inc. (C)  won a bid to block a
$383 million arbitration case brought by Saudi businessman Ghazi
Abbar.  U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton yesterday granted an
injunction, at the end of a nine-day trial in  Manhattan ,
blocking Abbar from arbitrating the case before the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. Abbar claimed New York-based
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. mishandled his family’s
investments and claimed a right to arbitrate the claim before
Finra.  Citigroup claimed Abbar was a client of Citigroup Global
Markets Ltd., based in  London , and therefore can’t force a Finra
arbitration. Stanton, who said Abbar interacted with Citigroup
divisions and offices in New York, London and Geneva in
connection with his family’s investments, ruled that his account
was with the London-based unit, not the  New York  unit.  “The entity in which the investor has his account, and
from whom the investor purchases his desired product, defines
the legal and business locus of his status as a customer, and is
the core of the relationship as a customer,” Stanton said in
his decision made public today.  “We are pleased with the decision,” Natalie Marin, a
Citigroup spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail.  The case is Citigroup Global Markets Inc. v. Abbar, 11-
cv-06993, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
