English soccer club Coventry City has
begun looking for a new stadium for its home games next season
after a dispute with the owners of its current ground.  Coventry, which plays in third-tier League One, is in
disagreement with Arena Coventry Ltd., owners of the Ricoh
Arena, over unpaid rent and game-day revenue. In March, the club
entered administration, a form of bankruptcy, when it also moved
its staff out of offices at the stadium.  “The fact is that we are being locked out of the Ricoh
Arena,” Coventry Chief Executive Tim Fisher said in the club’s
 statement . “We have been told that there is no further room for
negotiation and an offer that we made to get back round the
negotiating table has been rejected. It is with great regret
that we now have no alternative but to consider other
arrangements for next season and we would be failing the club,
its supporters and its staff if we did not start making such
plans now.”  Coventry, which won the F.A. Cup in 1987, moved into the
Ricoh Arena from its old Highfield Road stadium in 2005, when it
played in the second-tier Championship.  The Sky Blues were relegated to League One for this season
and finished in 15th place after receiving a 10-point deduction
for going into administration. Coventry last appeared in the
Premier League in 2001, when it ended a 34-year run in  England ’s
top flight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
