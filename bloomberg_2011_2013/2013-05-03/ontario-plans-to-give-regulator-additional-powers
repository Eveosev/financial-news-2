Ontario plans to give its securities
regulator more powers through changes in yesterday's provincial
budget to increase oversight over capital markets.  Premier Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal government proposed
changes to the Ontario’s Securities Act and Commodity Futures
Act to give regulators greater ability to pursue investigations,
tackle fraud and insider trading.  The government  proposes  new offenses for attempted market
manipulation and attempted fraud, and changes to expand and
clarify laws on insider trading and self-dealing provisions.  The Ontario Securities Commission will get greater ability
to share information with other regulators and law enforcement
agencies on investigations under the plan. Ontario also plans
changes to personal property security laws, updating disclosure
requirements for exchange-traded funds and updating early-
warning reporting for takeover bids.  The OSC will also get an expanded role in addressing
financial stability and systemic risk, the budget document said.  Wynne’s Liberals need support from opposition parties in
the legislature to pass the budget, which forecasts a C$11.7
billion deficit for 2013-14. The Progressive Conservatives have
said they would vote against the budget while the New Democratic
Party has said it would study it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
