Most Asian  stocks  climbed after the
 European Central Bank  cut  interest rates  to a record low and
U.S. jobless claims fell to the lowest in five years.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a Hong Kong-based clothier that
counts Europe as its biggest market, climbed 2.4 percent.
 Macquarie (MQG)  Group Ltd. surged 11 percent, its biggest gain in four
years, as profit at the  Australia ’s largest investment bank
topped estimates. Fletcher Building Ltd., a manufacturer of
construction products, sank 6.5 percent in Wellington as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. cut its outlook for building-material shares.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  was little
changed at 480.67 as of 6:18 p.m. in Hong Kong, with four stocks
advancing for every three that fell. Six of the 10 industry
groups in the regional gauge rose.  Japan  was closed today for a
holiday.  “Unlike at this point in the last three years, you have
central banks in Europe, the U.S. and Japan all easing,” said
 Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which has $126 billion under management.
“The market is a lot less worried about Europe. Profits are
continuing to rise and we remain overweight stocks on a positive
12-month view. Housing indicators in the U.S. remain firm and
the Fed is on standby. Valuations are still OK.”  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge that includes Japan, climbed 8.5 percent this
year through yesterday amid optimism the  Bank of Japan  will
deploy more measures to beat deflation and that policy makers in
the U.S. and China remain on standby to buoy growth.  That left the gauge yesterday trading at 14 times average
estimated earnings compared with 14.5 for the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  and 12.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.5 percent. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index and Taiwan’s Taiex Index both added 0.1
percent.  South Korea’s Kospi index advanced 0.4 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
lost 0.7 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index slipped 1
percent.  The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index dropped 1.1 percent,
heading for the biggest decline in three months, before the
national elections on May 5. Prime Minister Najib Razak’s 13-
party Barisan Nasional coalition faces a resurgent opposition
alliance led by former deputy prime minister  Anwar Ibrahim .
Najib said last month a win by a fractious opposition could
bring “catastrophic ruin.”  S&P Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The measure rose 0.9 percent yesterday after the
European Central Bank cut its main refinancing rate to 0.5
percent from 0.75 percent and Labor Department data showed the
number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits
unexpectedly fell to the lowest level in more than five years.  Esprit rose 2.4 percent to HK$10.92. Cosco Pacific Ltd.,
which operates a port in Greece, added 0.8 percent to HK$10.20.

gets about 72 percent of sales from  North America , advanced 3.3
percent to HK$18.94. James Hardie Industries SE, a building
materials supplier that counts the U.S. as its biggest market,
added 1.7 percent to A$10.05 in Sydney.  New World Development Co. (17) , the Hong Kong builder controlled
by billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , gained 3.3 percent to HK$13.92
after receiving permission from the city’s stock exchange to
proceed with the listing of its local hotels.  Australian Banks  Macquarie jumped 11 percent to A$43.11 in Sydney, its
biggest gain since June 2009, after posting a 17 percent
increase in full-year profit.  Declines in other Australian financial shares limited gains
on the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index.  Commonwealth

percent to A$71.06, a third day of losses.  Westpac Banking

saying it will pay a special dividend for the first time since
1988.  “The sector succumbed to a bout of profit taking after
what has been a standout week,” said  Tim Waterer , a Sydney-
based trader at CMC Markets Ltd. The S&P/ASX 200 Banks Index
climbed to a record earlier this week, posting a 2.8 percent
weekly advance.  Housing Slowdown  Fletcher Building sank 6.5 percent to NZ$8.03 in
Wellington, the biggest drop in 18 months, as Goldman Sachs
analysts said the Australian housing-market recovery is slower
than expected. The New Zealand-based company gets 47 percent of
its sales in Australia.  Genting Singapore Plc, one of two companies licensed to run
casinos in the city state, sank 7.8 percent to S$1.485 after
reporting a 44 percent slump in first-quarter earnings.  A report today is projected to show the U.S. unemployment
rate remained at 7.6 percent in April, while payrolls rose by
140,000 compared with an increase of 88,000 the prior month,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
