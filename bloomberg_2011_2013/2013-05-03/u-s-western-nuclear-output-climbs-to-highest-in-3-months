Nuclear-power production in the U.S.
West climbed to the  highest level in three months  as  Great
Plains (GXP)  Energy Inc. increased power at the 1,166-megawatt Wolf
Creek reactor in Kansas.  U.S. generation  gained 2.3 percent to 82,420 megawatts, or
81 percent of capacity, according to Nuclear Regulatory
Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the sixth
consecutive advance, the longest string since Dec. 7. Output was
 3.1 percent  more than a year ago with 19 of 104 nuclear reactors
offline.  Great Plains’ Wolf Creek 1, about 55 miles (88 kilometers)
south of Topeka, Kansas, was operating at 97 percent of capacity
today, up from 20 percent yesterday. The unit slowed early this
week for repairs associated with cooling water in a stator,
according to Cassie Bailey, a spokeswoman at the plant.  The increase sent Western nuclear output to 18,532
megawatts,  7.5 percent higher  than yesterday and the most since
Feb. 3, commission data compiled by Bloomberg show. A gain at
 Entergy Corp. (ETR) ’s 1,250-megawatt Waterford 3 reactor in Louisiana,
to 50 percent from 18 percent, also contributed.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 46 days in 2012, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
