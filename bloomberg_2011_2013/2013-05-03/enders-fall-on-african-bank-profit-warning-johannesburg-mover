South African lenders offering
unsecured credit fell after  African Bank Investments Ltd. (ABL) , the
nation’s largest provider of loans not backed by assets, said
its first-half profit will decline.  ABIL plunged as much as 17 percent, the most in almost 13
years, while  Capitec Bank Holdings Ltd. (CPI) , the second-largest
unsecured lender, decreased the most this year.  JD Group Ltd. (JDG) 
dropped to the lowest in four years.  “Consumers are already over-indebted and banks have been
finding ways still to lend to that consumer,” Lisa Haakman, an
analyst at NOAH Capital Markets Ltd., said by phone today from
Cape Town.  ABIL was down 16 percent at 24.51 rand, the most since June
2000 at 11:46 a.m. in Johannesburg. Earnings per share in the
six months through March slipped 25 percent to 28 percent, the
Johannesburg-based lender said in a statement yesterday after
the market closed. Capitec, based in Stellenbosch near  Cape
town , declined 3.9 percent to 210.50 rand while JD Group, South
Africa’s largest publicly traded furniture retailer, fell 6.9
percent to 30.95 rand.  South African lenders offer flexible terms, longer tenures,
loan consolidation and delayed payments, which make loans appear
more affordable than they are, Haakman said.  “Most of this is at the lower end of market where
inflation is dictated largely by electricity, food and fuel,
which have gone up considerably more than the consumer price
index,” she said. “Life is not a bowl of cherries for a large
majority of South Africans at the moment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
