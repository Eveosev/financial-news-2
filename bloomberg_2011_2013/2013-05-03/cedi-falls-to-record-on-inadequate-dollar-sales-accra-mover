Ghana ’s cedi weakened to a record
after the central bank’s dollar sales failed to stem the
currency’s slide and as traders bought the U.S currency to pay
for imports.  The currency of world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.9775 per dollar at 2 p.m. in Accra,
the capital, set for the lowest since at least 1994 when
Bloomberg started compiling the data.  “Traders are in majority” among the buyers of dollars
today, Richard Dei-Tutu, a currency trader at CAL Bank Ltd.,
said by phone today. “Most of them are bringing in rice and
poultry products.”  The central bank sold $24.2 million today, Adams Nyinaku,
the head of treasury at  Bank of Ghana , said by phone today. Of
that amount, $15 million was for oil imports, he said. The sale
was not enough to turn the corner for the cedi, Dei-Tutu said
and added “there’s still demand on the market” for dollars.  The cedi weakened 3.2 percent this year, compared with a 14
percent slump in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
