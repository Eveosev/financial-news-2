A  Manila Water Co. (MWC)  unit completed a
sewage-treatment plant upgrade on Boracay Island four years
ahead of schedule to ensure wastewater service for the tourist
area, the Manila Times said, citing company officials.  Boracay Island Water Co. general manager Ben Manosca said
the project was sped up, more than doubling the plantâ€™s
wastewater capacity, to better serve the growing needs of the
tourist island southeast of Manila, he told the Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
