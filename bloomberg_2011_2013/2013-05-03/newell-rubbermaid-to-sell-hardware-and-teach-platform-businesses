Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NWL) , the maker of
Sharpie pens and Calphalon cookware, put its Hardware and Teach
Platform businesses up for sale as part of a restructuring plan
to boost profitability.  The businesses, which include brands such as Bulldog,
Ashland and Amerock, represented about $300 million in revenue
in 2012, the Atlanta-based company said today in a statement.
Total  revenue  last year was $5.9 billion, up less than 1 percent
from the prior period.  Chief Executive Officer Michael Polk has been cutting jobs
and reducing operating units in an effort to improve margins and
boost sales outside the U.S. Last year, Newell announced plans
to eliminate 10 percent of its workforce.  Newell  rose  1.1 percent to $26.39 yesterday in  New York .
The shares have gained 19 percent this year compared with a 12
percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Separately, Newell today reported adjusted first-quarter
earnings per share of 35 cents, topping the 32-cent average of
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
