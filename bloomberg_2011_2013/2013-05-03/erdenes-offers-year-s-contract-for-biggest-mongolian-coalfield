Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi LLC, Mongolia’s
largest state-owned coal company, offered a one-year contract to
develop a part of the nation’s biggest coalfield, aiming to
revive interest among global mining companies.  The contract will be for mining as much as 2 million metric
tons of coking coal in the west Tsankhi area of Tavan Tolgoi,
Delgersaikhan Tsagaan-Uvgun, head of mine planning and technical
coordination at Erdenes, said by phone. The output will be sold
to Chinese buyers, he said.  In 2011, Mongolia picked  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) ,  China
Shenhua Energy Co. (1088)  and a group of companies led by OAO Russian
Railways to jointly develop the western area of Tavan Tolgoi,
which contains 1.8 billion tons of coal, 65 percent of which is
high-grade coking coal. The offer fell apart after  Japan  and
 South Korea  called the bidding process unfair and Mongolia’s
National Security Council, which reviews large foreign
investment projects, rejected the plan.  The offer for west Tsankhi is aimed at raising cash for the
company and isn’t a substitute for a bigger agreement that could
involve some of the world’s largest mining companies, Tsagaan-
Uvgun said.  “It’s a small amount of coal,” Tsagaan-Uvgun said. “It’s
a temporary measure.”  In February, Erdenes TT selected domestic miner Khishig
Arvin Industrial to remove the top soil at west Tsankhi. The
current step is “a continuation of the overburden removal,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
