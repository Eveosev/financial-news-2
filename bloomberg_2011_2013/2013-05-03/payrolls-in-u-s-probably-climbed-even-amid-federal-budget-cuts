Employers probably took on more staff
in April than in the prior month and the jobless rate  held  at a
four-year low, indicating the U.S. labor market withstood the
initial stages of  federal budget  cuts, economists said before a
report today.  The Labor Department said it expects to go forward with the
release of the April employment data on schedule today after a
fire overnight in the building. Jennifer Kaplan, a department
spokeswoman, said the report “should be” issued at 8:30 a.m.
Washington time.  Payrolls increased by 140,000 workers following a gain of
88,000 in March, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 90 economists. The jobless rate  stayed  at 7.6 percent,
matching the lowest since December 2008, the survey showed.  “There continues to be moderate improvement in the labor
market,” said Robert Stein, senior economist at First Trust
Portfolios LP in Wheaton,  Illinois , and the second-best payrolls
forecaster in the past two years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. “The reason for forward progress is that the economy
is still growing.”  Spending Cuts  Employment picked up last month even as planned government
spending cuts, which officials at the Federal Reserve this week
said are hampering growth, spread through the economy. A
prolonged slowdown may yet restrain hiring, making it more
difficult to reduce a jobless rate that central bankers continue
to view as too high.  While the Labor Department’s payrolls figures are projected
to show a pickup in job growth after a March slowdown, the pace
is weaker than the 197,000 average gain in the six months
through February.  The Labor Department will release the employment figures at
8:30 a.m. in  Washington . Economists’ payroll estimates ranged
from increases of 100,000 to 238,000 in the Bloomberg survey.  Private payrolls, which don’t include government agencies,
grew by 150,000 workers in April after a 95,000 gain the prior
month, the survey showed.  Other figures today are projected to show a decline in
March factory orders and service industries expanded last month
at the slowest pace since July.  Private Payrolls  A report based on private payrolls earlier this week showed
companies hired fewer workers than anticipated in April.
Headcounts at businesses grew by 119,000 last month, the fewest
since September, after a 131,000 gain in March, according to May
1 figures from the ADP Research Institute.  Fed policy makers said earlier this week they plan to
maintain $85 billion a month in bond purchases to spur growth
and employment prospects. They also said they were prepared to
raise or lower the amount should the economic outlook change.  “Labor market conditions have shown some improvement in
recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains
elevated,” the Federal Open Market Committee said in a May 1
statement. While pointing out that consumer spending, business
investment and the housing recovery have advanced, the central
bankers said “fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.”  Stocks fell on May 1 after the ADP report hinted at waning
job generation and after the Fed said it would keep injecting
cash into the economy. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped
0.9 percent.  Budget Restrictions  The Fed’s concern stems from the $85 billion in planned
budget reductions, known as sequestration, which commenced on
March 1. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cuts
will trim the nation’s gross domestic product by 0.6 percentage
point in 2013.  April’s projected pace of payroll growth, nonetheless,
signals employers haven’t yet retreated in anticipation of
weaker demand.  Ford Motor Co. (F) , reacting to U.S. pickup sales
that have gained momentum for almost two years straight, said it
plans to add workers at an F-150 truck factory to boost
production.  Ford will hire a third crew at its plant in Claycomo,
Missouri, to boost F-150 output starting in the third quarter,
the company said yesterday in a statement. The No. 2 U.S.
automaker is adding more than 2,000 employees at the factory for
the extra pickup production and to begin building the Transit
commercial van in mid-2014.  “It’s a huge vote of confidence in our truck, our sales
and what’s going on in the industry overall and the economy,”
Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of the Americas, said in a
telephone interview. “We wouldn’t be hiring if we didn’t think
it was going to last.”  Also today, the Institute for Supply Management will
release its  non-manufacturing  index at 10 a.m. Economists
 forecast  the gauge was little changed at 54 in April from 54.4 a
month earlier. Readings greater than 50 signal expansion.  A report from the Commerce Department at the same time is
projected to show a 2.9 percent decline in March  factory orders ,
the most since August, as demand slumped for commercial aircraft
and business equipment.  T  Bloomberg Survey  ================================================================  Nonfarm  Private Unemploy ISM Non-  Payrolls Payrolls     Rate     Manu  ,000’s   ,000’s        %    Index
