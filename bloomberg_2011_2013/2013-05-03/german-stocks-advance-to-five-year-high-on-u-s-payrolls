German stocks  advanced, pushing the
benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index to a record, as a report showed U.S.
employment picked up more than forecast and as  Adidas AG (ADS)  posted
profit that beat estimates.  Adidas surged to its highest price ever as its gross margin
widened in the first quarter.  Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD)  jumped the most
in five months after reporting an unexpected operating profit.
 ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  climbed 7.1 percent after saying it is in
“intense negotiations” with Vale SA and Brazilian authorities
on the sale of its Steel Americas unit.  The DAX rose 2 percent to 8,122.29 at the close in
 Frankfurt , its highest level ever, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The DAX was conceived as the successor to the Borsen-
Zeitung Index with a historical time series extending back to
1959. As a performance index, it has been calculated only from
December 1987. The benchmark’s previous highest close was
reached on July 16, 2007.  “The U.S. jobs data shows that the economy continues to
improve,” Raimund Saxinger, a  fund manager  at Frankfurt-Trust
Investment GmbH, which oversees about $22 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “But the rise in European markets may not
be a rational reaction because this was a direction of the
economy that we already knew about, and numbers being above
expectations may be just noise.”  The DAX rallied 3.9 percent this week as the  European
Central Bank  cut  interest rates  and investors speculated global
policy makers will continue economic-stimulus measures. The
broader HDAX Index rose 1.9 percent today.  U.S. Jobs  In the U.S., employment picked up more than forecast in
April and the jobless rate unexpectedly declined to a four-year
low of 7.5 percent, data showed today.  Payrolls expanded by 165,000 workers last month following a
revised 138,000 increase in March that was larger than first
estimated, Labor Department figures showed in  Washington . The
median forecast of 90 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected
a 140,000 gain. Revisions to the prior two months’ reports added
a total of 114,000 jobs to the employment count in February and
March.  Adidas jumped 7.6 percent to 85.50 euros, its highest price
since it sold shares to the public in November 1995. The world’s
second-largest sporting-goods maker said net income climbed 6.5
percent to 308 million euros ($403 million). That beat the 298.5
million-euro average estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The gross
margin widened to 50.1 percent from 47.7 percent. Analysts
predicted a gross margin of 48.6 percent.  Sky Deutschland  Sky Deutschland advanced 7.5 percent to 4.85 euros, the
biggest increase since November. The German pay-television
provider controlled by  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp. said first-
quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization were 5.8 million euros, compared with a 40.6
million-euro loss a year earlier. Analysts on average projected
an Ebitda-level loss of 4.7 million euros.  ThyssenKrupp gained 7.1 percent to 14.33 euros, the biggest
rally since November 2011. Germany’s biggest steelmaker said it
is talking to Vale, Brazilian development bank BNDES and the
government on the sale of Steel America operations.  Separately, UBS AG raised the stock to buy from sell.  Kloeckner & Co., Europe’s largest independent steel trader,
rose 3.9 percent to 9.35 euros.  Salzgitter AG (SZG) , Germany’s second-
biggest steelmaker, added 5.5 percent to 31.26 euros.  Hugo Boss AG (BOSS) , the German luxury-clothing maker controlled
by buyout firm Permira Advisers LLP, dropped 6.1 percent to
87.08 euros, the sharpest decline since Sept. 11, as Permira
sold 7 million shares, or a 10 percent stake, in the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
