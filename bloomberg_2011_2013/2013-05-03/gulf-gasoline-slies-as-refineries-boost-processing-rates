U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline on the spot
market weakened against futures as refinery activity climbed.
Crack spreads narrowed.  Refineries on the Gulf processed  7.81 million barrels  of
crude and other feedstock in the week ended April 24, up from
7.73 million in the previous seven days, according to U.S.
Energy Information Administration data compiled by Bloomberg.
Area stockpiles of gasoline were  71.7 million  barrels last week,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm said.  Refineries are “continuing to ramp up their crude
processing rates” after the turnaround season, said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  The discount for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
on the Gulf widened  0.5 cent  to 14.5 cents a gallon versus
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:11 p.m. Ultra-
low-sulfur diesel was  unchanged  at 3.5 cents below futures,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, retreated  66 cents  to $20.24
a barrel. The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil also
dropped 66 cents to $8.94 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
