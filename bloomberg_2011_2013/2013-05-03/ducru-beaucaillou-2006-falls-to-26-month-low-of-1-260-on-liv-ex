A case of Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou
2006, a second-growth Saint-Julien wine estate, sold for 810
pounds ($1,260) on  London ’s Liv-ex market this week, a 26-month
low and 10 percent down from its 2011 peak, Liv-ex data showed.  The vintage fetched as much as 900 pounds a case on Liv-ex
in November 2011 amid strong Asian demand for Bordeaux wines.
The 2006 vintage is the producer’s third-most expensive in
merchant listings of the past six years, according to data on
Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
