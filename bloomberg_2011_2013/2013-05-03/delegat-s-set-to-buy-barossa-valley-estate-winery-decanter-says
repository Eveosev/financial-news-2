Delegat’s Group Ltd., the New
Zealand-based owner of Oyster Bay winery, will pay A$24.7
million ($25.3 million) to buy  Australia ’s Barossa Valley Estate
out of receivership, Decanter.com said.  Barossa Valley Estate comprises 41 hectares (101 acres)
of vines on an 80-hectare site, a winery and brands including
E&E, Ebenezer, Barossa Valley Estate, Entourage and E Minor,
according to Decanter magazine’s website. Delegat’s was floated
on the New Zealand Stock Exchange in 2005, while remaining
two-thirds owned by the Delegat family, Decanter.com said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
