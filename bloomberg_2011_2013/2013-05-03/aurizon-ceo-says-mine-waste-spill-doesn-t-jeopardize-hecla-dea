(Corrects name of mine in first paragraph.)    Aurizon Mines Ltd. (ARZ)  said the spill of
mine waste at its Casa Berardi gold mine in Quebec doesn’t
jeopardize its C$670 million ($664 million) takeover by  Hecla
Mining Co. (HL)   The accident is a “minor” issue and operations at the
mine haven’t been interrupted, Vancouver-based Aurizon Chief
Executive Officer George Paspalas said today in a telephone
interview.  “We’ve categorically confirmed that there is no change in
the situation,” said Paspalas, who’s traveling to the mine
today. “The clean-up has begun.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
