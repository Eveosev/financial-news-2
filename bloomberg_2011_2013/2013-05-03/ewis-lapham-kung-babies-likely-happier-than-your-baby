Many experts in the west advise
parents that a baby who gets picked up too quickly when it cries
will be “spoiled.” The infant also needs to learn to sleep on
its own in a separate room and eat on schedule.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  By contrast, in hunter-gatherer societies such as the
!Kung, 88 percent of crying bouts get a response from the mother
or other women within three seconds -- almost none later than 10
seconds.  Most babies in these societies are in skin-to-skin contact
with their mothers during the day, sleep next to them during the
night and can nurse whenever they want.  !Kung infants spend at most one minute out of each hour
crying, mainly in 10-second bouts. They largely grow up to be
secure, confident, curious and autonomous children.  The hunter-gatherer model worked well for 100,000 years,
and, for Jared Diamond -- author of “The World Until Yesterday:
What Can We Learn From Traditional Societies?” -- the west
would do well to emulate these child-rearing practices.  I spoke with him on the following topics:  1. Raising Children  2. Caring for Elderly  3. Facing Danger  4. Health  5. Marriage  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
