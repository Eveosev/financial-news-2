The Canadian dollar fell against its
U.S. counterpart after job growth in its biggest trading partner
rose more than forecast last month, boosting appetite for the
U.S. currency.  Payrolls expanded by 165,000 workers last month following a
revised 138,000 increase in March that was larger than first
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median forecast of 90 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
projected a 140,000 gain. The jobless rate unexpectedly declined
to a four-year low of 7.5 percent.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, declined 0.1 percent to
C$1.0114 per  U.S. dollar  at 8:46 a.m in Toronto, the third
consecutive day of losses.  To contact the reporters on this story:
