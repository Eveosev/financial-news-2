Brazil  will hold an auction on Aug. 29
for contracts to sell energy from power projects including coal
plants which were previously banned from the events.  The auction is for the purchase of power from large
hydroelectric dams as well as plants that run on natural gas,
coal and biomass, national energy agency Empresa de Pesquisa
Energetica said today on its website. Projects will have to come
online on Jan. 1, 2018.  Coal plants were excluded from participating in Brazil’s
government organized power auctions in 2009 due to concerns over
greenhouse-gas emissions, Fernando Zancan, president of the
Brazilian Association of Mineral Coal, said yesterday in a
telephone interview.  In Brazil’s auctions, developers bid down the price at
which they will sell electricity, with the lowest price landing
a contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
