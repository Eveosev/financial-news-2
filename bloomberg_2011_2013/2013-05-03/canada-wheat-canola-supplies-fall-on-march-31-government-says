Canada ’s wheat inventories as of March
31 were 8.1 percent smaller than a year earlier at 13.46 million
metric tons, Statistics Canada said today.  Durum wheat supplies fell 13.7 percent to 2.66 million
tons, the Ottawa-based government agency said today in a
quarterly report. Canadian exports of all wheat may total 18.75
million tons in the year ending July 31, up 7.2 percent from a
year earlier, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said in an e-
mailed report April 17.  “Last year we had a fabulous, high-quality wheat crop that
has been easy to push overseas,” John Duvenaud, the publisher
of  Wild Oats Grain  Market Advisory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said
by telephone before the report. “Wheat exports have been moving
out of Canada at a rapid clip.”  Canola stockpiles at the end of March were estimated at
3.91 million tons, down 24.9 percent from a year earlier,
 Statistics Canada  said. Production fell 8.9 percent last year
after drought and disease reduced production. Exports in the
current crop year may fall 17 percent to 7.2 million tons, down
from a record 8.7 million a year earlier, according to the AAFC
report.  Barley inventories decreased 9.7 percent from a year
earlier to 2.96 million metric tons on March 31, Statistics
Canada said. Supplies of oats at the end of March fell 29.9
percent to 1.21 million tons from a year ago. Corn reserves rose
16.2 percent to 6.7 million tons.  The data came from a survey of 13,805 farmers conducted
between March 25 and April 3, Statistics Canada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
