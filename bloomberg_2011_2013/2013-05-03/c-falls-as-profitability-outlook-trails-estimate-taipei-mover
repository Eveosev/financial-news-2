HTC Corp. (2498)  dropped the most in almost
two months in Taipei trading after forecasting margins for this
quarter that missed analyst  estimates , an indication its One
handset may not be enough to restore earnings growth.  HTC  slid  5.3 percent in Taipei trading, the most since
March 6, to close at NT$279.50. The stock has lost 7 percent
this year,  compared  with a 5.7 percent gain for the benchmark
 Taiex (TWSE)  index.  Second-quarter gross margin will be 22 percent to 24
percent, HTC said yesterday, missing the 24.6 percent average of
19 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Its operating margin
forecast was about half the average of estimates. HTC One,
released in the U.S. in April, marks a “watershed moment” for
the handset maker after six quarters of declining market share,
Chief Executive Officer Peter Chou said in an April interview.  “Making a comeback is very challenging, despite continued
excellent execution in terms of products,”  Pierre Ferragu , who
 rates  the stock neutral at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. in  London ,
wrote in a report today. “Following the second-quarter
 guidance , we believe expectations will revise significantly
downwards and calm down expectations for a turnaround.”  Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC projected second-quarter sales of
NT$70 billion, in line with the NT$69.7 billion average of 20
analyst estimates and 23 percent less than a year earlier.  Operating  margin  will be 1 percent to 3 percent, implying
an expectation for operating profit of NT$700 million to NT$2.1
billion, compared with the NT$3.69 billion average of 18 analyst
 estimates .  Phone Delay  Gross margin was 20.3 percent in the first quarter and
operating margin was 0.1 percent, the company said.  Smaller-than-expected manufacturing capacity for the HTC
One’s camera caused a delay in shipments, Benjamin Ho, the
company’s marketing chief, said March 25.  The supplier situation has “greatly improved,” while
margins may rise in the third quarter, Chou said during a call
with investors yesterday.  HTC’s stock lost 40 percent last year and dropped 42
percent in 2011 after surging 158 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
