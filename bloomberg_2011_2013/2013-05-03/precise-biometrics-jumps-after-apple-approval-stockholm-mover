Precise Biometrics AB (PREC) , a Swedish
fingerprint log-in technology provider, rose the most in more
than a week after its mobile reader won approval for use on
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s latest iPad.  Precise Biometrics  jumped  as much as 15 percent to 1.73
kronor, the highest price since April 23, and was 12 percent
higher at 1.69 kronor at 9:22 a.m. in  Stockholm . The stock has
more than doubled this year, valuing the Lund-based company at
530 million kronor ($81.3 million.)  The approval of its mobile smart card and fingerprint
reader Tactivo by Apple allows government agencies and companies
to keep a high level of authentication and security when
employees access sensitive information, the company said in a
statement today. Chief Executive Officer Thomas Marschall said
Apple’s approval will help Tactivo’s global sales.  Precise Biometrics manufactures fingerprint security
solutions for identity cards and credit cards that are only
stored on the card and not in a data base. The company has said
previously that demand for its products has grown after the
Sept. 11 attacks, with nearly half of its annual sales coming
from  North America , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
