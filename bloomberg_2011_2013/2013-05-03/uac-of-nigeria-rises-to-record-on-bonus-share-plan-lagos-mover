UAC of Nigeria Plc , which has
interests in food products, logistics and real-estate services,
climbed to a record after saying it plans to pay a dividend and
issue bonus shares.  The stock gained a second day, rising 10 percent to 64.68
naira by the close in Lagos, the highest since at least January
2002 when Bloomberg began compiling the data. UAC proposed a
bonus of one share for every five held and dividend of 1.60
naira each for 2012, it said in a Nigerian Stock Exchange filing
yesterday.  “Investors are buying the company’s shares to partake in
the bonus, which is not common with the company,” David Adonri,
chief executive officer of Lagos-based brokerage Lambeth Trust
and Investment Co., said by phone today. “The divided is
another attraction and the profit that met expectations.”  Net income for 2012 jumped to 7.1 billion naira ($45
million) from 3.9 billion naira a year earlier, while revenue
advanced to 69.6 billion naira from 59.6 billion naira, the
company said yesterday.  UAC shares have risen 54 percent this year, compared with a
25 percent gain in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share  Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
