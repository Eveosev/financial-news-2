Liberia’s central bank sold the West
African nation’s first Treasury bills at an auction, with the
91-day notes yielding 2.22 percent, the lowest among African
debt of that duration tracked by Bloomberg.  The country sold 149 million Liberian dollars ($2 million)
after receiving 28 bids worth 298.8 million Liberian dollars,
Boima Kamara, head of the Central Bank of Liberia’s research,
policy and planning department, said in an interview in
Monrovia. The securities will mature on Aug. 1, he said.  Liberia’s plans to offer Treasury bills began at least
three years ago when the bank set up a department to work on
developing a  capital market  in the West African nation, where 14
years of war ended in 2002.  The country’s yields are lower than the 2.9 percent
Mozambique attracted at its last auction on April 30. Ghana’s
three-month borrowing  costs  are 23 percent,  Kenya ’s yields are
at about 10 percent, while  South Africa  sold notes at 5.1
percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
