Air France-KLM (AF)  Group narrowed its loss
in the first quarter as it raised average fares, and said it’s
poised to meet its target for lower unit costs and debt this
year as  Europe ’s largest airline works through a savings plan.  The airline posted an operating loss of 530 million euros
($692 million), compared with a loss of 611 million euros a year
earlier, it said in a statement today. The loss matched the
median forecast of analysts in a  Bloomberg survey . Sales rose to
5.72 billion euros from 5.65 billion euros.  The quarterly figures come in a year when Chief Executive
Jean-Cyril Spinetta has said he won’t promise earnings
improvement given fluctuations in fuel prices and uncertain
trends in global economic conditions and world trade. Spinetta
will step down on July 1, three months before he’s required to
quit, with French unit head Alexandre de Juniac taking over.  “In a difficult and uncertain environment, the group
continues the implementation of Transform 2015, which remains on
track,” the airline said in the statement “It confirms its
objectives for 2013 of a reduction in unit cost on a constant
currency and fuel prices basis, and a reduction in net debt.”  The airline’s fuel bill for the quarter fell 14 million
euros to 1.67 billion euros on the back of a 3 percent decline
in volumes. Unit revenue per available seat kilometer rose 1.2
percent, and the  load factor  for passenger traffic rose by 0.5
point to 82.1 percent, the Paris-based company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
