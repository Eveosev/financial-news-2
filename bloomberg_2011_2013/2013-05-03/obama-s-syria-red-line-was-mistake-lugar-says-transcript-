Richard Lugar , an  Indiana  Republican
who served six terms in the  U.S. Senate  and led its Foreign
Relations Committee, said in an interview airing this weekend on
Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ” that
President  Barack Obama  made a mistake by drawing a so-called red
line over Syrian chemical-weapons use.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: Welcome back. We’re joined now by the former
senator from Indiana and Foreign Relations Committee chair,
Richard Lugar. Senator, thank you so much for being with us.  RICHARD LUGAR: Thank you, Al. Thank you.  HUNT: President Obama said he was drawing a red line on
Assad using chemical weapons in Syria. If it’s conclusive that
he did, would the  United States  lose credibility in places like
 North Korea  and  Iran  if we don’t retaliate in a strong way?  LUGAR: There’s a possibility we might lose some
credibility, but at the same time, the difficulty of the
president drawing red lines, because of the chemical-weapons
situation, it’s difficult to prove whether there were weapons,
who used them, for what purpose, how severe was the prospect -  HUNT: So it was a mistake to draw that red line?  (CROSSTALK)  LUGAR: Yeah, I think so. And for the president’s opponents,
it offers a very good opportunity, once again, to say, well, he
just isn’t strong enough and doesn’t have the will and so forth.  HUNT: Let’s talk about some actions we could take in Syria,
supplying lethal weapons to the insurgents.  LUGAR: Well, let me just start by saying that the  New York 
Times-CBS latest poll - and this is three days ago - said that
62 percent of the American public believes we should not be
involved in Syria at all. Another 56 percent say not in North
Korea. That’s a pretty good chunk of the American public.  HUNT: Do you think they’re right about Syria?  LUGAR: I think probably they are. But at the same time, the
United States understanding the needs of our allies, as well as
our own humanitarian interests, has been at a nonlethal work
involving some food and masks and this type of thing. The
problem with the lethal situation, as General Dempsey and others
pointed out in congressional hearings, is that somebody may take
the weapons away from whoever you give them to, or you may make
a mistake in terms of whom you give them to, to begin with -  HUNT: Could be the wrong guys. We learned that in
 Afghanistan , didn’t we? Yeah.  LUGAR: Yeah. And in  Libya , we’re still tracing and trying
to find everything that was sent over there in that situation,
which was much less complex.  HUNT: How about using air power? How about taking a no-fly
zone, taking out the Syrian  air force , bombing Assad’s palace?  LUGAR: Well, that really does get into warfare, because he
does have some pretty good aircraft and air defenses. And it’s
all well and good to talk about the no-fly zone, but that really
does put American people at risk who are flying the planes, as
well as the planes themselves, and that really oversteps the
line. In other words, if we’re not going to get even into so-
called nonlethal or barely lethal, the thought of a no-fly zone,
seems to me, is not in the cards.  HUNT: OK.  LUGAR: Beyond that, you’ve got the fact that Brahimi, the
U.N. representative, now is indicating he would like to resign
and simply take the U.N. out of this business of attempting to
mediate or conciliate or define who the good guys are or what
have you. If that’s the case, there really are no observers that
can be helpful in determining who is really going over the lines
in Syria, to something that is going to be very, very hostile to
us.  HUNT: Let me switch across continents to  China . President
Xi’s much more aggressive rhetoric and claims, for territorial
claims over there, does that worry you? Is there a danger of any
kind of armed conflict in  Asia ?  LUGAR: I don’t think armed conflict, but clearly the new
president is indicating a more aggressive posture, but we knew
that was coming along. At the same time that the president’s
policy and that of the Congress, I think, has been to pivot
toward Asia, the idea of pivoting was that we would have
seapower out there. I was aboard the USS  George Washington  in
 Manila  harbor in October, and they’ve been out at sea for six
months. Everybody in Asia knows they’re out there, a lot of
other aircraft carriers.  Now, I would just say simply that we are cognizant of this.
We’re cognizant of a new president in South Korea, a lady who is
going to be more aggressive, of a new prime minister in  Japan ,
Abe, who likewise, with the Senkaku Islands and China, is much
more aggressive.  The Indonesians are very happy that we’ve been out there
with the George  Washington  or other follow-up craft as they’ve
gone, because we are taking an interest and we’re a presence and
we’re the presence. We still have the armed forces - when push
comes to shove, whether it be with the North Koreans or even,
heaven help us, with the Chinese, if there was really
aggression, I think everybody knows that.  HUNT: You mentioned North Korea. If they conduct another
nuclear missile test, as some people think is very likely, what
should the administration’s response be?  LUGAR: Well, I’m not going to prescribe a response on our
part. I think our planners have something in mind, and I would
say that they should. We’ve demonstrated already that we have
the airpower in the area, as well as the seapower, to make life
very difficult for the new North Korean leader and his
followers, for that matter. So as interesting that as the war
games in which the United States and South Korea have been
participating now have tapered off, so has some of the rhetoric.  Now, the most recent event now, of course, is the captivity
of an American citizen, a North - or, rather, a Korean-American
who was involved in the tourism business in North Korea. That’s
certainly a rather interesting, dangerous business, I would say,
but nevertheless, this may be a new attempt by the North Koreans
to engage us in some way. But at the same time, most American
leaders are saying, well, we’re not going to send another ex-
president over there. That’s been often the response.  I agree with  John Kerry , our new secretary of state, that
we really have to keep the door open. I’m not one that’s
suggesting we shouldn’t be thinking about talks with the North
Koreans, but I think that’s going to come about. But for the
moment, thanks to at least the end of these war games over
there, maybe things have backed off for the moment.  HUNT: One political question. Your party suffered major
rejections in last November’s elections. Looking at this
Congress - we’ve now had four months - do you think the
Republicans have learned anything from their experience?  LUGAR: Well, Republicans covers a lot of territory.  HUNT: It does.  LUGAR: In other words, you could analyze the problems that
Speaker Boehner has in the  House of Representatives . Many people
do every day. And they would say there’s a hardcore group,
there’s 120 or however many, who say, really, our job is not to
legislate, it’s not really to get into the budget. We came to
curtail government, smaller government, smaller spending,
smaller deficits. In other words, we are minions of the people
to do a job. So people say, well, let’s have regular order.
Let’s have hearings, for example. Well, that’s not what
Boehner’s half wants. And then if you have the Hastert rule that
you don’t move something unless a majority of your caucus is in
favor of it, you’re stopped.  HUNT: So the House is paralyzed then?  LUGAR: Yeah, I think they are. And that’s too bad, because
there are a lot of big issues out there, leaving aside foreign
policy.  HUNT: Well, that’s because Dick Lugar isn’t heading the
Foreign Relations Committee anymore.  Senator, thank you so much for being with us.  LUGAR: Thank you, Al.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
