Genting Singapore Plc (GENS) , one of two
companies licensed to run casinos in the city state, dropped the
most in three years after reporting first-quarter profit
plummeted 44 percent.  Genting slid plunged 7.8 percent to S$1.485 at the  close  in
 Singapore , the biggest decliner on the Singapore benchmark
Straits Times Index, which slid 1 percent.  “Given earnings volatility and low yield, Genting
Singapore’s valuation remains less attractive compared to Macau
 peers ,” Aun-Ling Chia, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Kuala
Lumpur, wrote in a note to clients published today. The
brokerage kept its hold  rating  on the stock with a share-price
forecast of S$1.38.  Genting, which operates the Universal Studios theme park in
Singapore, said yesterday profit fell to S$115.9 million ($94
million) in the three months ended March, compared with S$205.5
million a year earlier. Gaming revenue dropped 20 percent to
S$521.2 million during the period, surpassing the 8.7 percent
decline for rival Marina Bay Sands’s casino revenue to $640.2
million.  OCBC Investment Research cut its rating on the stock to
sell from hold. “Genting Singapore has now turned more cautious
for the rest of the year, citing a more uncertain global
economic outlook, especially with the recent muted economic data
coming out of  China ,” analyst Carey Wong wrote in a note.  Of the 23 brokerages covering Genting, nine recommend
selling the stock, nine recommend buying it and five have hold
 ratings , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
