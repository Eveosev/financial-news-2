Shares of Asian banks and information
technology companies advanced this week as Macquarie Group Ltd.
and Samsung Electronics Co. posted higher profits. Japanese
exporters fell as the yen touched a two-week high.  Macquarie,  Australia ’s largest investment bank, jumped 14
percent. Samsung Electronics, the world’s biggest maker of
mobile-phones gained 3.3 percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a Hong
Kong-based clothier that gets about 79 percent of sales from
Europe, climbed 8.8 percent in Hong Kong after the European
Central Bank cut its interest rate to a record low. Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s No. 1 carmaker, slipped 3.9 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed for the week
at 140.02, with about six shares rising for every five that fell.
The measure has rallied for the past six months, the longest
winning streak since September 2009, on optimism  Japan  will
deploy more measures to beat deflation. The Federal Reserve said
this week it will maintain its bond buying at $85 billion a
month, while the ECB lowered its main refinancing rate to 0.5
percent from 0.75 percent.  “Unlike at this point in the last three years, you have
central banks in  Europe , the U.S. and Japan all easing,” said
Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which has $126 billion under management.
“The market is a lot less worried about Europe. Profits are
continuing to rise and we remain overweight stocks on a positive
12-month view. Valuations are still OK.”  The Asian benchmark traded at 14 times estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with 14.7 times for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 13.1 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Philippine Rally  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.6 percent, while
South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  climbed 1.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index gained 0.6 percent, while  China ’s Shanghai Composite
Index rose 1.3 percent in a two-day trading week.  Philippine Stock Exchange Index jumped 2.7 percent to a
record high after the nation won its second investment-grade
debt rating on May 2.  The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index slipped 1 percent,
declining for the first time in six weeks, ahead of the national
elections May 5. Prime Minister Najib Razak’s 13-party Barisan
Nasional coalition faces a resurgent opposition alliance led by
the former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim. Najib said last
month a win by a fractious opposition could bring “catastrophic
ruin.”  Japan’s Topix Index, the broadest measure of the country’s
equity performance, dropped 0.7 percent this week as the yen
strengthened to a two-week high on April 30. A stronger yen cuts
the value of overseas income at Japanese exporters when
repatriated. The gauge on April 30 capped its biggest monthly
advance since 1999 and an eighth month of gains, its longest
winning streak since January 2006.  Japan Consolidation  “In the short-term, some markets like Japan and the U.S.
have been overbought and could consolidate from day to day,”
said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of Asian multi-asset
strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd., which manages about
$51 billion. “But we are not talking about a 10-15 percent
correction.”  Macquarie jumped 14 percent to A$43.11, the highest since
June 2010, in Sydney after reporting full-year profit rose 17
percent from a year earlier to A$851 million ($873 million).
That surpassed the A$821 million average estimate of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  climbed 5.8
percent to A$31.60 this week after posting higher first-half
profits. Westpac Banking Corp., the nation’s second-biggest
lender, gained 3 percent to A$33.55 after saying it will pay a
special dividend as cash earnings improved. National Australia
Bank Ltd., which is due to report its results on May 9, added
3.4 percent to A$33.74.  Profit Surprises  Samsung Electronics gained 3.3 percent to 1.535 million won
in  Seoul . The company reported on April 26 net income increased
42 percent from a year earlier to a record 7.15 trillion won
($6.5 billion).  Of the 281 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
reported  quarterly results  since April 1 and for which estimates
are available, about 53 percent surpassed analyst estimates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  LG Uplus Corp., South Korea’s smallest mobile-phone carrier,
jumped 25 percent to 11,800 won, the biggest advance on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index. The company posted first-quarter profit that
beat analyst estimates.  Companies that do business in Europe advanced. Esprit rose
8.8 percent to HK$10.92 this week in Hong Kong. HSBC Holdings
Plc, Europe’s biggest lender, gained 2.2 percent to HK$85.25.
 Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , the operator of ports, utilities and
retail-store chain that gets 53 percent of revenue from Europe,
added 2.5 percent to HK$85.10.  Toyota, Honda  Japanese exporters declined. Toyota dropped 3.9 percent to
5,490 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets about 83 percent of
revenue outside Japan, fell 4.7 percent to 3,820 yen. Canon Inc.,
the world’s biggest camera maker, slid 3.2 percent to 3,445 yen.  Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. (011200) , South Korea’s second-biggest
