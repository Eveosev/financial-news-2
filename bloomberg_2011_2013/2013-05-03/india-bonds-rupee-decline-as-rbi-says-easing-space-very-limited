Indian sovereign bonds fell after the
central bank said the room to cut borrowing costs this year to
support economic growth is limited because of inflation and a
record current-account deficit. The rupee weakened.  “Monetary policy would need to be calibrated recognizing
the very limited policy space available to ease further,” the
Reserve Bank of India said yesterday in an economic review
before today’s rate decision in Mumbai. The RBI will lower its
 repurchase  rate to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent, according to
33 of 40 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Six see no change and
one predicts a cut to 7 percent.  The yield on the 8.15 percent securities due June 2022 rose
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.77 percent as
of 10:39 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That is the biggest increase since March 26. The yield
touched 7.68 percent yesterday, the lowest level for a benchmark
10-year note since July 2010, and has risen three basis points
this week.  “Yields have definitely reacted to the RBI’s comments
yesterday,” said Harihar Krishnamoorthy, Mumbai-based treasurer
at  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  He said he sees one more 25 basis point cut in
the fiscal year through March 2014 after today if consumer-price
inflation eases and the budget deficit is reined in to within
4.8 percent of gross domestic product as planned.  The RBI statement cited “significant” risks, including a
“high” current-account gap and “inflation above the threshold
over which it becomes inimical to growth sustainability.”  Rupee Drops  The rupee declined 0.3 percent to 53.965 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 53.6650
yesterday, the strongest since Feb. 28, and has gained 0.8
percent this week. One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a
gauge of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, rose 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, from
yesterday to 8.95 percent.  India  will auction 150 billion rupees ($2.8 billion) of
bonds maturing in 2018, 2026, 2030 and 2041 today.  The European Central Bank yesterday cut its key interest
rate to a record low as the 17-nation euro region struggles to
emerge from recession. ECB President Mario Draghi signaled
another reduction is possible. U.S. Federal Reserve officials
raised the prospect of increasing the monthly pace of bond
buying above $85 billion to guard against any slump in growth or
employment.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.92 per
dollar, compared with 54.81 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.58 versus 54.41. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
