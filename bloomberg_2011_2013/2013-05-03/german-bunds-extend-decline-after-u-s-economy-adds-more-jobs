German 10-year bunds extended a
decline after a report showed the U.S. economy added more jobs
than economists forecast last month.  Benchmark 10-year yields climbed as much as four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point to 1.21 percent and were at
1.20 percent at 1:33 p.m. London time.  Italian bonds maintained an advance, with the 10-year yield
dropping three basis points to 3.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
