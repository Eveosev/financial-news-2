Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
said Japan’s unprecedented monetary stimulus was understood at a
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from China,
 South Korea , and 10 Southeast Asian nations.  “I strongly stressed that our monetary easing is aimed at
overcoming a 15-year-long deflation, and I believe we’ve gained
understanding in this regard,” Kuroda said today after the
“Asean-plus-three” meeting, which was held near New Delhi
during the  Asian Development Bank ’s annual meeting.  Japan’s monetary policy, aimed at reaching 2 percent
 inflation  in two years, has weakened the yen, fueling concern
that emerging nations will experience disruptive capital
inflows. The Asean-plus-three nations remain vigilant on the
unintended negative side effects on the region stemming from
extended periods of global monetary easing, according to the
group’s statement released today.  Earlier today, China’s Vice Finance Minister  Zhu Guangyao 
said while the Asean-plus-three nations had “different
opinions” on Japan’s quantitative easing, the meeting helped
them understand Japan’s position. The talks will promote
financial cooperation in the region, he added. The finance
ministers of China and South Korea didn’t attend the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
