Phil Jackson , who guided the  Los
Angeles Lakers  to five National Basketball Association
championships and the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls to six,
will advise the  Detroit Pistons  on their coaching search.  Tom Gores, the Pistons’ owner and chief executive officer
of Platinum Equity LLC, said in a statement that Jackson is
“one of the best minds in the business.”  “We are thrilled to have him as an adviser,” said Gores,
adding that President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars
welcomes input from Jackson.  The 11 championships for Jackson-coached teams are two more
than the number won by Red Auerbach with the Boston Celtics, the
next highest in NBA history.  Jackson, 67, left the Lakers after the 2010-11 season and
is mentioned whenever a high-profile coaching or front-office
vacancy occurs in the NBA. ESPN reported this week that the
 Toronto Raptors  were pursuing him as team president.  The Pistons fired coach Lawrence Frank after a 29-53 season
record and a 54-94 mark in two years.  The Detroit News said former Seattle SuperSonics and
Portland Trail Blazers coach Nate McMillan has interviewed for
the Pistons job. The Pistons, according to the newspaper, are
also interested in Indiana Pacers assistant Brian Shaw, who
worked under Jackson with the Lakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
