Treasuries extended losses after U.S.
employers added more jobs in April than forecast, boosting the
outlook for growth and trimming demand for refuge.  U.S. 10-year notes yields reached a one-week high as the
U.S. employment rate unexpectedly fell to 7.5 percent, a four-
year low. Yields on benchmark notes had reached to the lowest
levels this year this week as  European Central Bank  cut interest
rates and the  Federal Reserve  said it may increase or reduce the
size its purchases of government and mortgage debt as conditions
warrant under its quantitative-easing stimulus strategy.  “This nonfarm payroll number establishes a floor under
Treasury yields,” said Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about
$10 billion as co-head of government and mortgage-backed
securities at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. “The Fed
continues to have its foot on the accelerator. That will keep a
lid on how high Treasury yields can go. At the same time, this
was a pretty decent payroll number, so that’s likely to put a
floor on how low yields can go.”  The benchmark 10-year note  yield  rose seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.70 percent as of 8:49 a.m. in  New
York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of
the 2 percent note due in February 2023 fell 22/32, or $6.88 per
$1,000 face amount, to 102 22/32.  It touched 1.61 percent on May 1, the lowest level since
Dec. 11.  Jobs Data  Payrolls expanded by 165,000 workers last month following a
revised 138,000 increase in March that was larger than first
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median forecast of 90 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
projected a 140,000 gain. Revisions to the prior two months’
reports added a total of 114,000 jobs to the employment count in
February and March.  The jobless rate dropped to the lowest level since December
2008 from 7.6 percent in March.  “It’s an improvement, but not a game changer,” said
Richard Schlanger, who helps invest $20 billion in fixed-income
securities as vice president at Pioneer Investments in  Boston .
“We’re going to continue to drift in this range.”  Growth Restraint  Policy makers at the central bank said May 1 that “fiscal
policy is restraining economic growth.” The statement, by
highlighting the option to boost purchases in response to data
showing economic growth is slowing, struck a contrast with
discussion of the timing of a reduction in the pace of buying at
the Fed’s March meeting.  The economy had added an average of 179,000 people a month
to nonfarm payrolls in 2011 and 2012, Labor Department data
show. The  jobless rate  had stayed above 8 percent since February
2009 until it broke the trend in September.  Treasuries dropped on Dec. 7, pushing yields up four basis
points to 1.62 percent, when the 146,000-job increase in
payrolls in November beat a Bloomberg survey forecast of 85,000.  Treasuries rallied in April as economic data from job
growth to retail sales to inflation showed the pace of growth
faltering, with  U.S. government debt  returning 1.1 percent, the
best monthly performance since July 2011, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Fed Buys  The U.S. central bank has been buying $85 billion of bonds
each month since the start of the year, $45 billion in
Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage debt, in an effort to
hold down borrowing costs and encourage economic growth. It has
kept its benchmark  interest-rate  target for overnight lending
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to
support the economy.  Treasury 10-year yields dropped on May 1 to the lowest
level this year after an industry report showed U.S. companies
added fewer workers than economists forecast. Data on April 26
showed the economy grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the
first quarter, below the 3 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  “There’s been a loss of momentum” in the  U.S. economy ,
said Bill Bovingdon, chief investment officer in Sydney at
Altius Asset Management, which oversees the equivalent of $513
million. “The rational response is for bond yields to fall.”  Central banks around the world are trying to reduce
borrowing costs to support their economies.  The European Central Bank cut its benchmark  interest rate 
by a quarter percentage point to a record low of 0.5 percent
yesterday. The  Bank of Japan  is purchasing more than 7 trillion
yen ($71.3 billion) of securities each month to spur growth.  Fed purchases have helped reduce volatility in the Treasury
market. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE Index measuring
price swings declined to a record 49.04 basis points on May 1.
The average for the past decade is 96.9 basis points.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $32 billion of three-year
notes on May 7, $24 billion of 10-year debt the following day
and $16 billion of 30-year bonds on May 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
