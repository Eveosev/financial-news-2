A wind-whipped wildfire, charring an
area more than half the size of  Manhattan , forced the evacuation
of a college with 4,900 students and threatened 4,000 homes
northwest of Los Angeles.  More than 925 firefighters battled the blaze known as the
Springs Fire, which grew to more than 15 square miles (39 square
kilometers) south of Camarillo yesterday, said the Ventura
County Fire Department. In Camarillo,  California State
University, Channel Islands  was evacuated and State Route 1,
known as the Pacific Coast Highway, was closed.  While wildfires are common in California, an abnormally dry
winter has left the Golden State more vulnerable than usual,
fire officials  warned  last month. More than  840 wildfires  have
occurred since January, about 320 more than the five-year
average, according to the state Forestry and Fire Protection
Department, known as Cal Fire.  “We have already seen a big increase in the number of
fires that normally occur at this time of year, and summer
hasn’t yet arrived,” Mark Ghilarducci, secretary of the
 California  Emergency Management Agency, said in a statement.  In the Springs Fire, 15 homes were damaged, though none
destroyed, according to the Ventura Fire Department. Ninety fire
engines, as well as helicopters and fixed-wing air tankers were
fighting the blaze, the department said in a statement. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency said it would reimburse the
state for 75 percent of the cost.  Weather Warning  The  National Weather Service  extended a red flag warning
for today in most of Los Angeles and Ventura counties because of
dry Santa Ana winds, which blow desert air toward the Pacific
coast. Gusts reached 45 miles per hour yesterday.  The winds brought humidity down to 5 percent or less,
 forecasters  said, while daytime temperatures ranged to near 100
degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius). The weather warning is used to
alert area residents and firefighters that conditions are ideal
for rapidly spreading wildfires. Camarillo is about 50 miles
from Los Angeles.  Firefighters yesterday closed a stretch of Pacific Coast
Highway from Malibu, near Los Angeles, to the Ventura County
line. The six-mile closing, which will last until 6 p.m.
tomorrow, forces travel between coastal Santa Monica and cities
to the north such as Oxnard, Ventura and Santa Barbara to be
rerouted inland.  Colorado Destruction  Besides the Springs Fire, at least  five others  dotted
California yesterday, covering more than 10,000 acres (40 square
kilometers). Fires across the state in 2008 killed 23 people. A
year earlier, 1,500 homes were burned and nine people died in
fires visible from space.  Large wildfires aren’t limited to California. Colorado
suffered its most destructive fire season last year, with dozens
of blazes fueled by drought-ravaged grass and beetle-killed
timber. Flames destroyed at least 600 homes and charred more
than 116,000 acres. Damage was estimated at more than $450
million, with the Waldo Canyon blaze, which consumed entire
neighborhoods in the foothills around Colorado Springs, becoming
the most expensive fire in state history.  Cal Fire has 4,700 full-time firefighters and foresters who
are aided by another 8,700 seasonal and local workers. The state
also uses prisoners to fight wildfires. About 3,850 inmates are
housed in more than 40 camps statewide for fire duty, according
to the latest  inmate population data .  The figure was little changed from 2011, before Governor
Jerry Brown shifted thousands of non-violent offenders to county
jails under federal court orders to reduce crowding.  The Corrections Department said 82 crews, consisting of
1,093 inmates and 97 guards, were assisting in battling 14 fires
across the state yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
