Chrysler Group LLC, moving past costly
rollouts of new Ram pickups and Jeep sport-utility vehicles,
said production rebounded in April for the No. 3 U.S.
automaker’s first monthly increase since November.  Chrysler’s North American output rose 13 percent to 216,758
cars, SUVs and trucks, from 192,491 a year earlier, the  Auburn
Hills , Michigan-based company said on its website. Production in
April was the highest since Fiat SpA-controlled Chrysler built
220,101 vehicles in  August .  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of Chrysler and
Fiat, is relying on Chrysler and its 37 straight monthly U.S.
sales gains, to offset losses at Turin, Italy-based Fiat’s mass-
market brands in  Europe . Rising production should help Chrysler
rebound from a 65 percent decline in first-quarter profit, which
was dragged down by introductions of the new Ram Heavy Duty
truck and  Jeep Grand Cherokee  and Compass SUVs. Automakers
record revenue when vehicles are shipped to dealers.  “The best way to look at this is a one-time event, it’s a
one-off; just close your eyes, plug your nose and move it on
from here,” Marchionne told analysts on an April 29 conference
call.  Chrysler earlier this week said its April U.S. sales rose
11 percent, topping the 10 percent increase that was the average
of 11 analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Chrysler’s
share of the U.S. market has risen for three straight years, to
11.4 percent in 2012, according to researcher Autodata Corp.  First-quarter net income slid to $166 million from $473
million a year earlier. Chrysler held to its forecast for annual
revenue of $72 billion to $75 billion and net income of about
$2.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
