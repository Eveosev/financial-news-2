Moody’s Corp., (MCO)  the second-largest
credit rater, reported first-quarter profit that beat analysts’
forecasts on demand for company ratings.  Net income rose to $188.4 million in the three months ended
March 31, from $173.5 million a year earlier, New York-based
Moody’s said today in a statement distributed by Business Wire.
Earnings excluding certain items were 97 cents a share,
surpassing the average estimate of 87 cents in a Bloomberg
survey of seven analysts.  Moody’s has reported profit increases for  three  straight
years as companies take advantage of record-low interest rates
to sell unprecedented amounts of debt. While the pace of
corporate bond issuance worldwide slowed in the first quarter,
Moody’s increased its share of revenue in the market.  The company said revenue increased 13 percent to $731.8
million for the first three months of the year, from $646.8
million a year earlier. Its credit-rating unit, Moody’s
Investors Service, accounted for $521.2 million of the total.
Corporate debt ratings revenue increased 29 percent to $258.3
million, the company said in the statement.  Moody’s  full-year net income  of $690 million last year was
the most since 2007, when structured-finance grades made up 39
percent of revenue. The market for complex mortgage-backed
securities deteriorated that year with the collapse of the
housing market and start of the credit crisis.  Lawsuit Settled  Moody’s, which helped start the business of ranking
companies by their ability to repay debt in 1909, settled a
lawsuit last month that claimed its grades weren’t objective
when rating structured investment vehicles. The company climbed
to the highest level in more than five years after investors led
by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and King County,  Washington  agreed
to drop their claims.  Moody’s shares have climbed 53 percent in the past year to
$60.55 through yesterday.  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , the company’s biggest  shareholder , reduced its holdings
this week by 1.75 million shares from prices ranging from $59.93
to $60.94, according to a May 1 regulatory filing.  Corporate bond issuance worldwide fell 7.5 percent to $1.09
trillion in the first three months of the year from $1.17
trillion in the same period of 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Revenue at Standard & Poor’s, the biggest credit rater,
climbed 20.4 percent during the period to $561 million on what
Chief Executive Officer Harold “Terry” McGraw called
“resurgence” in structured finance, the New York-based unit of
McGraw Hill Financial said April 30.  (Moody’s will hold a conference call for analysts and
