A collection of 66 magnums of Chateau
Mouton-Rothschild spanning the years between 1945 and 2008 is
poised to lead a two-day Christie’s International Plc wine
auction in Geneva this month, according to its online catalog.  The vertical Mouton lot carries a presale estimate of as
much as 300,000 Swiss francs ($322,000), while a parallel
collection of 66 standard-sized Mouton bottles dating from the
same vintages carry a price tag of as much as 150,000 francs.
Each lot spans 64 vintages and includes two bottles from the
years 1978 and 1993.  Demand from investors for Bordeaux after two price slumps
in the past five years has boosted the London-based Liv-ex Fine
Wine 50 Index by 9 percent since November, when it touched a 31-month low. The gauge fell in April after posting four straight
monthly gains, as investors focused on the pricing of the new
Bordeaux 2012 vintage coming to market and how that will affect
older wines already trading.  “Our prediction for the wine market in 2013 is that a
considerable amount of the ground lost in 2012 will be regained
by mature vintages, and perhaps a little less so by younger
wines,” Peter Lunzer, founder of Lunzer Wine Investments in
 London , said in his e-mailed April market report. He helps
manage wine investment and trading accounts worth $34 million.  Mouton-Rothschild is one of five Bordeaux left-bank first-growth producers, winning promotion to that status in 1973. Its
labels have featured different artists each year since the end
of World War II, with contributors including  Georges Braque ,
 Andy Warhol  and  Marc Chagall .  Henri Jayer  The Christie’s Geneva sale also offers a case of Henri
Jayer Vosne-Romanee Cros Parantoux 2000 Burgundy, estimated to
fetch as much as 48,000 Swiss francs, and 10 bottles of the same
producer’s Cros Parantoux 1995, with a price tag of as much as
45,000 francs.  The Geneva sale follows an Amsterdam auction by Christie’s
last month at which top lots included a single bottle of
Romanee-Conti 1986 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy, which
fetched 6,900 euros ($9,040), and three bottles of Chateau
Cheval Blanc 1949, which sold for 6,325 euros.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
