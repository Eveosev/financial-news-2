Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  Chief
Executive Officer Lowell McAdam hinted in a meeting that Verizon
Wireless, the company’s joint venture with  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,
may not pay a distribution to its owners this year.  McAdam said the priority for Verizon Wireless’s cash flow
will be to pay down the $5 billion in debt coming due between
now and the middle of 2014 before paying dividends to the
owners, according to a note yesterday by  Philip Cusick , an
analyst at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , which hosted the meeting
earlier this week.  Verizon reiterated its desire to buy Vodafone’s 45 percent
stake of Verizon Wireless and “expressed discipline on price,”
Cusick said.  Verizon has communicated with some analysts that it
believes the fair value for Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in
Verizon Wireless is about $100 billion, people familiar with the
matter said last month. Numerous private talks between
executives of both companies about settling the stake sale never
amounted to much, in part because Vodafone is dismissive of the
$100 billion offer and doesn’t see it as a reasonable opening
bid, the people said.  “Management believes that a premium would not be warranted
for the minority stake given Verizon’s management control,”
Cusick said in the note, referring to the fact that Vodafone
hasn’t had a direct role in overseeing the venture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
