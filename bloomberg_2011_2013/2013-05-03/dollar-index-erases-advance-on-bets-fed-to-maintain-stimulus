The  Dollar Index (DXY)  erased gains amid
speculation the Federal Reserve won’t slacken stimulus even
after U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose more than forecast in April.  The gauge, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses to
track the greenback versus currencies of six major U.S. trade
partners, reached a one-week high after America’s unemployment
rate fell to the lowest in four years. The Federal Open Market
Committee maintained its commitment this week to buying assets
under the quantitative-easing stimulus strategy until there’s
significant improvement in the labor market.  “Nonfarm was strong, but not strong enough to bring in
expectations of QE tapering,”  Camilla Sutton , head of currency
strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia, said by telephone from Toronto.
“It’s a strong enough report, but it’s not strong enough to
shift the expectations of the FOMC.”  The Dollar Index fell 0.2 percent to 82.075 at 10 a.m. in
New York after reaching 82.517, the highest since April 26. It
climbed yesterday as much as 1.1 percent, the most since April
17, after dropping on May 1 to a two-month low of 81.331. The
gauge has lost 0.4 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
