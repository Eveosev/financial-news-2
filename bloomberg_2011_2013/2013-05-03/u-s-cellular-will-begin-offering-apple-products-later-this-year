U.S. Cellular Corp. (USM) , a Chicago-based
provider of mobile-phone service, expects to get  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
products later this year, joining the country’s four largest
carriers in offering the devices.  The company agreed to purchase $1.2 billion worth of
iPhones from Apple over a three year period starting later this
year, the wireless carrier said today in a regulatory filing.  “We have a number of strategies in progress to increase
loyalty and attract more customers, including our announcement
today that we will begin offering Apple products later this
year,” Chief Executive Officer Mary Dillon said in a statement.
“By further strengthening our device portfolio, we’ll give
consumers another great reason to switch to U.S. Cellular.”  Apple’s iPhone, the best-selling smartphone in the U.S.,
may help the company compete with larger carriers. U.S. Cellular
also is rolling out a speedier network based on long-term
evolution, or LTE, technology. Still, the network expansion is
increasing capital-spending costs and revenue will probably
decline this year, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  U.S. Cellular also agreed to sell operations in Chicago,
 St. Louis  and other markets to  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  in November,
a move that will reap $480 million but decrease the size of its
footprint.  Shares fell 2.8 percent to $37.38 at the close in  New York .
The stock has climbed 6.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
