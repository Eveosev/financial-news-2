Commercial production of shale gas
from  IGas Energy Plc (IGAS) ’s U.K. sites is likely in three years, its
chief executive officer said.  IGas plans to drill two exploratory wells before the end of
the year, Andrew Austin said in an interview in  London . The
company will have gas-in-place estimates by the end of May,
after which a decision on where to drill can be made, he said.  The government is preparing tax breaks to encourage
exploration for shale gas as it seeks to counter a decline in
production from the  North Sea  and cut reliance on imports. It’s
also “engaging with industry and communities” on how to ensure
locals benefit from any development of resources, the Department
of Energy and Climate Change said by e-mail this week.  “The government is getting to a position to make shale
happen,” Austin said yesterday. The tax breaks are “likely to
be similar to other field allowances used to stimulate
development” across the U.K. Continental Shelf, he said.  The company, based in London, plans to start fracking next
year, Austin said. Hydraulic fracturing, as the technique is
also known, blasts water, sand and chemicals at high pressure
into underground rock to release trapped fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
