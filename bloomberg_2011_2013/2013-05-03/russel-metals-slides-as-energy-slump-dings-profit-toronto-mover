Russel Metals Inc. (RUS) , a steel processor
and distributor, pared losses after falling the most in 11
months as the company reported earnings that missed expectations
due to lower volume, especially in the oil and gas industry.  Russel fell 0.3 percent to C$26.89 at 4 p.m. in Toronto
today after slumping as much as 3.6 percent earlier, the biggest
intraday slide since June 2012. Shares in the Mississauga,
Ontario-based company have dropped 2.6 percent this year.  The company yesterday reported adjusted  earnings  of 36
cents a share for the first quarter, short of analysts’ average
estimates of 45 cents according to a Bloomberg survey and below
53 cents reported a year ago.  “The decline in volume in the first quarter impacted most
sectors,” Brian Hedges, chief executive officer at Russel, said
in a statement. “The drop in  Canada  was more severe than the
U.S. and reflects the impact on the Canadian economy of the
energy slowdown in  Alberta  for both the  oil sands  and
conventional gas drilling activities.”  Russel distributes tubes and piping to the oil and gas
industry, primarily in western Canada and the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
