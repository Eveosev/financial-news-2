Peru’s sol surged the most since 2011
after the Andean nation ruled out a bid for the local assets of
Repsol, allaying concern that the government plans to increase
control of natural resources.  The sol jumped 0.8 percent to 2.6250 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:11 a.m. in  Lima , the most on a closing basis since June 2,
2011, according to prices from Datatec.  Petroleos del Peru SA, the state oil company commonly known
as Petroperu, won’t bid for a refinery, gas distributor and
service stations that Repsol may put up for sale, Energy and
Mines Minister Jorge Merino told reporters yesterday. The
decision will bolster investor confidence, the Lima Chamber of
Commerce said in an e-mailed statement. Copper, the country’s
top export, rose the most since October 2011 as U.S. hiring
picked up more than expected.  The sol’s gain “reflects the mix of good political news
along with a substantial rally in copper prices,” said  David Spegel , the global head of  emerging markets  strategy at ING
Financial Markets in New York.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due
August 2020 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 3.87 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price rose 0.18 centimo to 124.82 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
