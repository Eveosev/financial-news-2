Gold headed for a second weekly
advance, the best showing since March, as optimism that global
stimulus will be sustained countered a reduction in bullion-
backed exchange-traded products.  Bullion for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.6 percent
to $1,475.40 an ounce, and was at $1,471.55 at 9:38 a.m. in
Singapore. The metal is 0.6 percent higher this week on signs of
increased physical purchases. Gold had its worst month of losses
since December 2011 in April after plunging into a  bear market .  The  European Central Bank  cut borrowing costs to a record
yesterday, while saying monetary policy “will remain
accommodative for as long as needed.” The  Federal Reserve  on
May 1 maintained the pace of its monthly asset purchases. Gold
rallied for 12 years through 2012 as central banks around the
world including the Fed ramped up stimulus to spur growth.  “Gold lifted after the ECB cut its main refinancing
rate,”  Lachlan Shaw , an analyst at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , wrote in an e-mail. “The recent fall in prices
resulted in a surge of physical demand for coins and jewelry. If
the  U.S. economy  continues to show improvement, we expect gold
investment demand and prices to weaken further.”  ETP holdings  fell  to 2,262.665 metric tons yesterday, the
least since October 2011, and are 0.9 percent lower this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Assets have shrunk for
the past 23 sessions, contracting by 369.3 tons this year.  Losing Money  Elliott Management Corp. said that gold remains the best
store of value in an uncertain global economy even as its
position in the metal has lost money this year, according to an
addendum accompanying a first-quarter letter to investors. The
$21.8 billion hedge-fund firm founded by  Paul Singer  joins  John
Paulson  in sticking with gold after the metal plummeted 9.1
percent on April 15 in the worst slide since 1983.  While prices have rebounded from a two-year low of
$1,321.95 on April 16 as physical demand from the U.S. to  China 
and the Middle East increased, they are 5.8 percent below the
April 11 close of $1,561.45 that preceded the slump.  Gold for June delivery climbed 0.2 percent to $1,470.70 an
ounce on the Comex. Twenty analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect
bullion to drop next week, with nine bullish and four neutral,
the biggest proportion of bears since February 2010.  Silver was little changed at $23.8415 an ounce, heading for
a weekly loss. Platinum rose 0.4 percent to $1,504.60 an ounce,
set for a second weekly advance and palladium was little changed
at $694.45 an ounce, also poised for a second weekly climb.  To contact the reporter for this story:
