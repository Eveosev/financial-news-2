Palm oil climbed, recovering from the
lowest level in more than a week, on speculation that demand for
commodities may rise on improved economic prospects as
stockpiles decline in  Malaysia , the second-biggest producer.  The contract for July delivery rose as much as 0.9 percent
to 2,282 ringgit ($749) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives and traded at 2,267 ringgit at 12:10 p.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Futures are headed for a 2.1 percent drop this week.  The European Central Bank cut borrowing costs to a record
yesterday, while saying monetary policy “will remain
accommodative for as long as needed.” Reserves in Malaysia
dropped to a seven-month low of 2.17 million tons in March as
exports advanced, according to Malaysian Palm Oil Board data.  “People are confident that the ECB’s move would bring more
liquidity in the market, the economic prospects could improve
and generally improve commodities demand,” Ivy Ng, an analyst
at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone from Kuala Lumpur.
“This combined with the expectation that stockpiles in Malaysia
will decline is aiding prices.”  Traders are waiting for further cues from the Malaysia Palm
Oil Board’s April supply and demand data due next week, said
Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte.  Soybeans for July delivery rose 0.5 percent to $13.785 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil climbed 0.5
percent to 48.73 cents a pound. Soybean oil’s premium over palm
was at $329.46 a ton today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Refined palm oil for September delivery rose 1 percent to
5,892  yuan  ($957) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil advanced 0.8 percent to 7,240 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
