Industrial metals including copper and
lead climbed after the European Central Bank reduced interest
rates to a record and U.S. filings for unemployment benefit fell
to a five-year low, boosting the outlook for demand.  Copper for delivery in three months rallied as much as 1
percent to $6,916.25 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange,
and traded at $6,909.50 at 10:26 a.m. in  Shanghai . It has lost
1.7 percent this week, the sixth decline in seven, on concern
that economic growth in  China , the largest user, may falter.  The ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.5 percent from
0.75 percent. In the U.S., applications for unemployment-
insurance payments fell 18,000 to 324,000 in the week to April
27, the fewest since January 2008, while consumer sentiment
climbed to the highest in more than five years. The U.S. is the
second-largest consumer of the metal used in pipes and wires.  “The good economic data from the U.S. aided the technical
rebound for metals,” Xu Liping, an analyst at HNA Topwin
Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “We are still in a
sell-on-rally environment as growth in China, which accounts for
40 percent of the global consumption, is in question.”  Copper for delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose
0.6 percent to 50,000  yuan  ($8,119) a ton. The July contract on
the Comex gained 0.6 percent to $3.1240 per pound.  China’s non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index fell
to 54.5 from 55.6 in March, the National Bureau of Statistics
and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today.
Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  Lead futures in London rebounded after dropping into a bear
market yesterday amid concern that global growth may slow. The
metal climbed as much as 1.5 percent to $1,970 a ton and traded
at $1,967.50. It remains on course for a weekly loss.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
