Natural gas futures fluctuated in New
York after dropping below $4 on speculation that demand for the
heating and power-plant fuel will slump amid milder weather.  Gas moved between gains and losses as Commodity Weather
Group LLC predicted more seasonal weather patterns over the next
six to 15 days after a late season cold snap. Gas dropped 7
percent yesterday after a government report showed a bigger-
than-forecast stockpile gain.  “Shoulder-month temperatures are generally very mild and
are going to impact demand in a bearish way,” said Brad Florer,
a trader at Kottke Associates LLC in Louisville,  Kentucky .
“That was a nasty move yesterday so you would think that we’re
a bit overdone.”  Natural gas for June delivery fell 0.5 cent to $4.02 per
million British thermal units at 9:26 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 6.4 percent above the
100-day average for the time of day. The futures dropped as low
as $3.977, trading below $4 for the first time since April 5.  Prices are down 3.2 percent this week, headed for the
second straight decline after nine weeks of gains.  To contact the reporters on this story:
