German  government bonds  were little
changed before a report that economists said will show producer
prices in the euro area declined in March.  Benchmark  10-year yields  were within five basis points a
record low after the  European Central Bank  cut its key interest
 rate  to an all-time low 0.5 percent yesterday. Euro-area price
inflation slowed by 0.2 percent in March, according to the
median estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg  survey , after
rising 0.2 percent in February. U.S. Labor Department data are
forecast to show American employers hired more workers in April
than in March and the unemployment  rate  held at a four-year low.  German 10-year bunds yielded 1.17 percent at 7:10 a.m.
London time. The rate fell to 1.15 percent yesterday, the lowest
level since July 23, when it matched the record low of 1.127
percent. The price of the 1.5 percent security, maturing in
February 2023 was at 103.055.  Two-year (GDBR2)  note yields were at minus
0.04 percent, the least since March 28.  European government bonds rose yesterday after ECB
President  Mario Draghi  signaled officials will consider charging
banks to park excess cash with the central bank overnight in a
bid to boost the economy.  German government bonds returned 1.1 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
