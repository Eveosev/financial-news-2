The European Union predicts Hungary
will overshoot the bloc’s deficit limit next year, casting doubt
on the country’s exit from its monitoring for budget offenders.  The  shortfall  will widen to 3 percent of gross domestic
product this year and 3.3 percent in 2014 from 1.9 percent in
2012, breaching the 27-nation bloc’s limit of 3 percent,
according to forecasts published today by the European
Commission, the EU’s executive. The commission projected
deficits of 3.4 percent for this year and next in February while
the government targets a gap at 2.7 percent for both years.  Since coming to power in 2010, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban 
sacrificed growth to keep the shortfall within EU limits and
remove the threat of cuts in the bloc’s funding. Hungary may not
be released from the so-called excessive-deficit procedure if
the EU sees the country overshooting the limit this year or
next, Peter Beno Banai, deputy state secretary at the  Economy
Ministry  told the Budapest-based Magyar Nemzet newspaper today.  “The EU will presumably not propose lifting the procedure
if we meet the criteria in 2013 but they calculate with a
slightly higher number for 2014,” Banai said.  The forint gained 0.2 percent to 295.63 per euro by 10:38
a.m. in Budapest, its strongest since April 18. The currency has
gained 2.3 percent this week, which puts it on course for its
biggest weekly rally in almost 11 months and the best
performance among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It
has weakened 1.5 percent this year.  GDP, Inflation  The  economy  will expand 0.2 percent this year and 1.4
percent in 2014 after contracting 1.7 percent in 2012, according
to the commission. The government sees economic growth of 0.7
percent this year. Inflation will probably average 2.6 percent
in 2013 and 3.1 percent in 2014 after 5.7 percent last year, the
EU said. The central bank targets 3 percent annual price growth.  Hungary  should be allowed to exit the deficit procedure,
Orban said in an interview on public radio MR1-Kossuth today,
adding that the EU is often “unjust” and uses “double-
standards” by being flexible on budget rules for some
countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
