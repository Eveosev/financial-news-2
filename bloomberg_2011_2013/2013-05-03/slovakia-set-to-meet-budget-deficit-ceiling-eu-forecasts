Slovakia is set to meet the goal of
narrowing the  budget deficit  to the European Union’s limit as
early as this year, the European Commission said, cutting its
February projection for an overshoot.  The EU’s Brussels-based executive arm predicts the  gap  will
match the ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product this
year before widening to 3.1 percent in 2014, it said in a report
today. Public debt will increase to 54.6 percent of GDP in 2013
and 56.7 percent in 2013 from 52.1 percent in 2012, it said.  Facing a slowing economy, the administration of  Robert Fico 
is struggling to improve public finances to differentiate itself
from ailing euro-region members. The government is targeting a
deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP this year.  The commission cut its forecast for 2013  economic growth  to
1 percent from 1.1 percent. The expansion is set to slow from
last year’s 2 percent as demand for country’s exports has been
hurt by the bloc’s debt crisis, pushing up unemployment.  The eastern euro-region member last year cut the deficit to
4.3 percent of GDP from 5.1 percent. Moody’s Investors Service
said yesterday that the narrowing shortfall is credit positive
and the 2013 target is “within reach.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
