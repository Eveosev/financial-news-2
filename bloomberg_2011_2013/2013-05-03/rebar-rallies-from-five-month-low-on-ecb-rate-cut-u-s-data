Steel reinforcement-bar futures
recovered from the lowest level in more than five months as the
European Central Bank reduced interest rates to a record and U.S.
jobless claims fell, boosting the outlook for demand.  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange advanced as much as 1.9 percent to 3,610  yuan  ($586) a
metric ton, before trading at 3,599 by 11:10 a.m. local time.
Futures lost 1.6 percent to 3,542 yuan yesterday, the lowest
most-active price at close since Nov. 30. Futures, little
changed this week, lost 6.2 percent in the past two weeks.  The ECB lowered its main refinancing rate to 0.5 percent
yesterday from 0.75 percent. In the U.S., applications for
unemployment benefits fell 18,000 to 324,000 in the week to
April 27, the fewest since January 2008, while consumer
sentiment climbed to the highest in more than five years.  “Rebar benefited from slightly improved sentiment,” Ren Xinlei, analyst at Luzheng Futures Co., said by phone from
Qingdao today. Gains will be limited after iron ore prices
declined, he said.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port dropped 3.5 percent yesterday
to $129.40 a dry ton, the lowest since December 14, Steel Index
Ltd. data show. The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.2
percent to 3,568 yuan a ton yesterday, according to the Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
