Pig prices declined in the past week
in much of the European Union amid ample supplies, industry
group Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter Deutschlands
e.V. said.  Hog prices in  Germany , the EU’s biggest producer, fell to
1.586 euros ($2.058) a kilogram (2.2 pounds), down 3.6 percent
from a week earlier and the lowest in at least eight weeks,
Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in an online  report  yesterday.
Prices in France were 1.564 euros a kilogram, 2.4 percent below
the previous week. Prices also fell in the Netherlands,  Belgium ,
Spain and  Austria .  In Germany, “the slaughter companies’ purchasing
capacities are quite limited currently with the quantities on
offer being rather extensive,” ISN said. Processor demand also
was reduced as companies closed for a public holiday on May 1,
it said.  In Great Britain, pig prices rose 1.7 percent from a week
earlier to 1.878 euros a kilogram, the highest recorded price
among the 10 countries tracked this week by ISN. Prices were
unchanged from a week earlier in Denmark, Italy and Ireland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
