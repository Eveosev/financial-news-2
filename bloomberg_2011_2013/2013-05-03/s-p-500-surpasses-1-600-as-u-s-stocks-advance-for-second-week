U.S.  stocks  rose to successive records
during the week and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index traded above
1,600 for the first time, extending a 2013 rally fueled as
individuals and professionals alike increased bullish bets.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  climbed 2 percent to 1,614.42 for the week. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  briefly surpassed 15,000 on May 3
and ended the week up 261.41 points, or 1.8 percent, to
14,973.96. Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines
Corp. and Walt Disney Co. led the Dow’s advance during the week,
gaining at least 4.7 percent.  Stocks advanced as U.S. employment picked up more than
forecast, the European Central Bank cut interest rates and data
on home sales and  consumer confidence  signaled the American
economy gaining momentum. Investors have become more confident
with hedge funds doubling  bullish bets  on the S&P 500 and
individuals adding $66.5 billion to equity mutual funds in 2013.  “As we move through some of these psychological barriers,
Dow 15,000 and S&P 500 1,600, that’s a reinforcing confidence
factor for investors to say, ‘Wow, the market’s continuing to
move up. The recovery’s intact. Maybe I need to increase my
equity exposure,’” Darrell Cronk, the New York-based regional
chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank, which
oversees $170 billion, said by telephone.  Technology, energy and material stocks advanced the  most 
out of 10 S&P 500 groups as investors bought shares of companies
most tied to economic growth.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the world’s third-
biggest energy company by market value, increased 2.9 percent to
$123.49. Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, added
4.2 percent to $8.62. The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities
jumped 1.4 percent for the second week of gains.  Apple, IBM  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  rose 7.9 percent to $449.98 for the biggest gain
since November. The iPhone maker sold $17 billion of debt in the
biggest corporate bond sale ever. IBM surged 5.2 percent, the
most in three months, to $204.51 after approving $5 billion in
buybacks and boosting its dividend.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  rallied 5.4 percent to $28.31. The social-
networking company posted first-quarter sales that topped
estimates, a sign that Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg 
is gaining ground in his effort to make more money from mobile
advertising.  The S&P 500 reaching 1,600 shows is another milestone in
its recovery from the 38 percent plunge in 2008, the worst
performance since 1937, as the housing bubble burst and the U.S.
financial system required a government bailout. The Dow reached
a record on March 5, erasing its losses from the financial
crisis three weeks faster than the S&P 500.  Break Out  “We’ve finally seen the broader market break out to all-
time new highs, and it’s being led by blue-chip stocks,” Craig Johnson, Minneapolis-based technical market strategist at Piper
Jaffray Cos., said by phone. “When this blue-chip index is
breaking out to new highs, it’s pretty hard to ignore,” he said
of the Dow.  Central bank efforts to ignite economic growth and reduce
unemployment have supported stock prices. The ECB cut its main
refinancing rate on May 2 and President Mario Draghi said policy
makers may take the unprecedented step of charging banks to hold
excess reserves.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has injected more than $2.3
trillion into the financial system since 2008 and Bank of  Japan 
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last month began a campaign to end
falling prices by doubling monthly bond purchases in a bid to
reach 2 percent inflation in two years.  ‘Great Comfort’  “The fact of the matter is the Fed and the ECB stand ready
to do whatever it takes to stimulate growth,” Ron Sloan, chief
investment officer of Atlanta-based Invesco Ltd.’s U.S. Core
Equity team, said by phone. He oversees about $12 billion. “The
market takes great comfort in that.”  Hedge funds and other institutions are speculating stocks
will extend gains by purchasing futures on the U.S. equity
benchmark. Money managers were net long 56,172.60 contracts on
the S&P 500 in the week ended April 30, data compiled by
Bloomberg and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The
figure reached 56,800 in March, the highest since January 2009,
the data going back 15 years show.  “Everyone does appear to be a bit more bullish, relative
to where they were one year ago,” Joseph Tanious, a  New York- 
based global market strategist for JPMorgan Funds, which
oversees $400 billion, said by phone. “Institutional investors
are leading the way and retail investors are hopping on the
bandwagon.”  Fund Flows  About $14.5 billion was deposited in equity funds in March
and $14.2 billion in February, according to data from
Washington-based Investment Company Institute. Flows in January
were positive for the first time in 11 months and the highest in
nine years, ICI data show.  The market may have run too far, too fast as some companies
are struggling to boost sales, according to Randy Bateman, chief
investment officer of Huntington Asset Advisors in Columbus,
 Ohio . About half of the S&P 500 missed analysts’ estimates on
sales, while 73 percent beat  profit forecasts , according to
Bloomberg data on the 405 companies that have reported so far.  “There is some sluggishness in earnings that I think the
market will pay a lot of attention to, particularly since it’s
already had a big move,” Bateman said by phone. His firm
oversees $15 billion and is holding more cash than usual. “We
could very well see some backing and filling in this market.”  Historical Slump  The second quarter has historically meant losses for
equities. The S&P 500 slumped as much as 9.9 percent from April
through June last year. It erased 19 percent from April through
October in 2011 and 16 percent from April to July in 2010.  American Express Co., Home Depot Inc. and Disney have led
the Dow’s rally since its 2009 low, climbing more than 300
percent as the world’s largest economy recovered from the worst
recession in seven decades. Hewlett-Packard Co., the largest
personal computer maker, is the only stock still in the measure
to fall since March 9, 2009. The shares are down 19 percent as
consumers favor tablets and mobile phones over PCs.  The S&P 500 is  cheaper  than when it reached a record in
October 2007. The gauge is valued at 15.8 times earnings in the
last year, compared with 17.5 at its 2007 peak and 31 when it
reached a record in March 2000.  “The fact that we still have record earnings provides good
fundamental support to the markets,” Brian Jacobsen, who helps
oversee about $217 billion as chief portfolio strategist at
Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls,  Wisconsin , said
by telephone. “We also have quite a bit of support from central
banks around the world. You put those two together -- the
fundamentals and the support from not just the Fed but now the
Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank -- and it’s hard to
say that the market shouldn’t be where it is.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
