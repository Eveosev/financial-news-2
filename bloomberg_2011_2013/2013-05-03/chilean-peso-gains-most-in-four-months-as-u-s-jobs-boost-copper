Chile ’s peso climbed the most in four
months as copper surged after a better-than-forecast gain in
U.S. employment boosted the demand outlook for the Andean
nation’s top export.  The peso climbed 0.5 percent to 469.4 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:30 a.m. in Santiago after strengthening as much as 0.7
percent. The gain pushed this week’s advance to 0.8 percent.  Copper soared the most in 17 months after the U.S. Labor
Department said non-farm payrolls rose 165,000 last month,
beating the median forecast of 90 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The U.S. is the second-biggest consumer of copper.
Chile’s peso is the second-strongest currency in  Latin America 
this year as the country’s stable 5 percent  interest rate 
attracts investors who can profit from the differential in rates
between Chile and  Europe , the U.S. or Japan.  “Copper is rising fast so we may see stop-losses being
triggered and people will start talking about central bank
intervention again,” said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency
forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “If
they do intervene it will only be a better opportunity to earn
carry in Chile so it could come back to where it is now.”  Foreign investors in the forwards market had a $5.2 billion
short peso position on April 30, down from $6 billion on April
25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
