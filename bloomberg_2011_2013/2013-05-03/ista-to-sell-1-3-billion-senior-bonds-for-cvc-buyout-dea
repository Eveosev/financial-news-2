Ista International GmbH is selling
bonds to support CVC Capital Partners’ 3.1 billion-euro ($4.1
billion) buyout of the German metering company.  The deal comprises 500 million euros of senior secured
notes due 2020 and 525 million euros of senior subordinated
securities due 2021, a person familiar with the situation said.
Investor meetings will begin on May 6 to support the deal.  CVC agreed last month to buy a majority stake in Ista from
Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP. The acquisition is also being
financed with a 1.15 billion-euro seven-year term loan B portion
and a 150 million-euro credit line, according to bond marketing
materials.  Markus Pliessnig, a spokesman for Essen, Germany-based
Ista, declined to comment on the deal.  The term loan B may pay an interest margin of 450 to 475
basis points, or 4.5 to 4.75 percentage points, more than
benchmark rates, people familiar with the situation have said. A
lender meeting is due to take place today to help sell the loan
portion of the financing.  The senior secured bonds may be rated B+ by Standard &
Poor’s, four levels below investment grade, and the senior bonds
B-, the rating company said. Ista’s ratio of debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization may be
about 7.2 times at the end of 2013, according to the report.  Deutsche Bank AG is coordinating the transaction with Bank
of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Nomura Holdings Inc,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  also arranging the deal,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ista provides electricity, water, heat and gas-meter
