Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  said its  South Korea 
unit recalled some children’s Tylenol after discovering that
bottles contained too much of the medicine.  The company withdrew Children’s Dye-Free Tylenol Suspension
-- Cherry Flavor in 100 milligram and 500 milligram bottles,
said Samantha Lucas, a spokeswoman for New Brunswick, New
Jersey-based J&J. Some bottles were found during quality-control
tests to have too much acetaminophen, the active ingredient in
the drug, she said.  J&J, the world’s biggest maker of health-care products, has
faced production issues since 2010, including a U.S. recall of
over-the-counter medicines such as children’s Tylenol. As a
result, the company closed a factory and signed a consent decree
with U.S. regulators to oversee some manufacturing. A variety of
other products, including blood-sugar meters, metal hip implants
and a bone putty used to stop bleeding, also have been recalled.  The recall in South Korea was announced April 23, Lucas
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
