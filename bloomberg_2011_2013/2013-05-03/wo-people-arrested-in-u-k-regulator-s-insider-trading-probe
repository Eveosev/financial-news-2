The U.K. financial regulator said a
man and a woman were arrested in West  London  as part of an
insider-trading probe.  The regulator and the City of London Police executed a
search warrant in West London, the Financial Conduct Authority
said in a statement. Offices and homes in Zug,  Switzerland , were
also searched by Swiss police in connection with the FCA
investigation, a person familiar with the probe said.  “Two people, a man aged 41 and a woman aged 37, were
arrested and questioned in connection with an investigation into
insider dealing and market abuse,” the London-based FCA said in
the e-mailed statement today.  The arrests aren’t linked to any on-going investigation,
the FCA said. The watchdog is currently prosecuting seven other
people for insider dealing, which carries a maximum sentence of
seven years in prison.  Police in Zug weren’t immediately available to comment.  The FCA on April 1 took over the market abuse and consumer
finance enforcement duties from the Financial Services
Authority, which was phased out by lawmakers who blamed it for
failing to prevent the financial crisis in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
