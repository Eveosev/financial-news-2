The setting of the London interbank
offered rate, a benchmark interest rate known as Libor, was
“actively manipulated,” Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
said today.  Carney, in panel remarks at an event in Toronto, said
people lied about the rate to protect the reputation of firms
they worked for, and in some cases to “make money on
derivatives that were based on where that rate was, and they
actively manipulated it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
