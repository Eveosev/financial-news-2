Warner Music  Group Corp., the third-
largest music content company, lowered the rate on a $820
million loan to support its acquisition of Parlophone Label
Group and is seeking to lower borrowing costs on an existing
$492 million of debt.  The $820 million piece, which expires in July 2020, will
pay interest at 2.75 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, with a 1 percent minimum, down from 3.25
percentage points more than Libor and a 1 percent floor
initially proposed, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. The loan will be
offered to lenders at 99.75 cents on the dollar.   Warner, which is buying Parlophone, home to Coldplay, the
Pet Shop Boys and Tina Turner, from  Universal Music Group  for
about 487 million pounds ($756 million), is also seeking to
reduce the rate on a $492 million  term loan  to 2.75 percentage
points with a 1 percent floor, the person said. The  Santa
Monica , California-based-company pays 4 percentage points more
than Libor with a 1.25 percent floor on the debt currently,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing and
requests that lenders submit commitments by 5 p.m. today in New
York, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
