Foresight Group LLP, a British asset
manager, issued a 60 million-pound ($93.5 million) bond to
refinance U.K. solar plants and support plans to invest 250
million pounds within a year.  The bond, which will be listed in London, has been used to
refinance the company’s existing photovoltaic plants in Britain,
Sevenoaks-based Foresight said in a  statement  today. It’s the
largest such bond in the U.K. and an endorsement of the low-risk
profile of operating solar parks, the manager said.  Foresight is taking advantage of a fast-growing U.K. solar
market, which saw a record number of large-scale projects
completed in the first quarter. The company, which has several
solar funds with plants in the U.K.,  Italy  and  Spain , raised 30
million pounds for British projects in the first quarter and
aims to boost investments this year.  “Foresight plans to deploy a further 250 million pounds
into new large-scale ground-based solar projects in the U.K.
over the next 12 months,” said Ricardo Pineiro, an investment
manager at the company. “We are finding growing appetite from
both institutional and retail investors, who see solar power as
a maturing asset class with an attractive risk profile.”  The index-linked revenue stream for U.K. solar assets
offers an attractive fixed income-like return given the current
low yields of treasury gilts, according to Foresight.  The bond was arranged by Independent Debt Capital Markets
LLP, an affiliate of private bankers Mirabaud Securities Ltd. It
refinanced projects in Kent, Somerset and Wiltshire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
