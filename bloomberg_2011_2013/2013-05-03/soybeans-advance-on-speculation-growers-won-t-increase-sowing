Soybean futures rose for the first
time in four days on speculation that U.S. growers won’t swing
acreage away from corn after rain slowed grain sowing.  Advances in seed technology, including “short-season”
crops that grow faster than normal, will allow farmers to stick
with corn, even if sowing is delayed, said  Brian Hoops , the
president of Midwest Market Solutions. Wet weather next week
will “keep planting progress slow,” Telvent DTN, based in
Omaha,  Nebraska , said in a report.  “With the technology and the hybrids we have, we will see
corn acres get into the ground,” Hoops said in a telephone
interview from Springfield,  Missouri . “Back 20 years ago, we
would’ve seen the jump to soybeans, but now we have short-season
hybrids. Not a lot of acres are going to be shifted from corn.”  Soybean futures for July delivery gained 1.1 percent to
settle at $13.8725 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price rose 0.5 percent this week.  Corn futures for July delivery slipped 0.1 percent to
$6.6125 a bushel. This week, the price surged 6.7 percent, the
most since July, after rain and frigid weather inhibited
planting.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
