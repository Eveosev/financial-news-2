Cia. Cervecerias Unidas SA (CCU) ,  Chile ’s
biggest brewer, fell the most since 2008 after Bank of America
Corp. recommended investors dump the shares amid falling beer
sales and intensifying competition.  CCU, controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, slumped 5.5
percent to 7,740 pesos at 1:01 p.m. in Santiago, its biggest
fall on a closing basis since December 2008. The country’s
benchmark Ipsa index advanced 0.5 percent.  Bank of America cut its rating to the equivalent of sell
from hold, saying the Santiago-based company’s alcoholic
beverage business was disappointing in the first quarter.
Brazilian rival Cia. de Bebidas das Americas, also known as
AmBev, is likely to push to expand Chilean operations, according
to Bank of America.  “We look for AmBev to continue leveraging excess affiliate
capacity, cheap shipping and a strong peso to grow its Chilean
operations and pressure CCU profitability,” analysts  Robert Ford  and Melissa Byun wrote in an e-mailed note today.  CCU yesterday reported net income of 40.3 billion pesos
($86 million) in the first quarter, lower than average estimate
of 42.6 billion pesos of three analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
