Stocks in Switzerland  advanced, with
the Swiss Market Index rising to its highest level in more than
five years, as a report showed that U.S. hiring increased and
the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell in April.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
brand, posted the biggest gain on the  SMI (SMI) , climbing 2.2 percent.  The SMI added 0.5 percent to 7,937.61 at the close in
Zurich, its highest level since January 2008. The gauge rallied
1 percent this week as the European Central Bank cut its
benchmark interest rate. The broader Swiss Performance Index
climbed 0.6 percent today.  “Today’s data point is an important one,” said Christoph Riniker, head of strategy research at Bank Julius Baer & Co. in
Zurich. “In the longer term, things still bode well for equity
markets. The ECB is still willing to support developments.”  The U.S. economy added more jobs in April than economists
had forecast and the  jobless rate  unexpectedly declined to a
four-year low of 7.5 percent, a Labor Department report showed.
Payrolls expanded by 165,000 workers last month and by a revised
138,000 in March. An earlier release had estimated that payrolls
climbed by 88,000 in March. The median forecast of 90 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg had projected a 140,000 gain.  Richemont rose 2.2 percent to 77.10 Swiss francs, its
highest price since March 18.  Swatch Group AG, the biggest maker of Swiss watches,
advanced 1.3 percent to 546 francs, a one-month high. The shares
have  rallied 18 percent  so far this year.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  gained 1.7 percent to 21.29 francs. The world’s
largest maker of power transformers generated  27 percent of its
revenue  from the Americas last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Adecco Ltd. advanced 1.6 percent to 50.80 francs.
The world’s biggest supplier of temporary workers gets about 19
percent of its  revenue from North America , the data show.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s second-largest
lender, increased 1.9 percent to 26.89 francs and  Julius Baer
Group Ltd. (BAER)  added 1.1 percent to 37.51 francs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
