Hugo Boss  AG dropped the most in eight
months in Frankfurt trading after majority owner Permira
Advisers LLP said it plans to sell a stake in the German luxury-
clothing maker.  Hugo Boss  fell  as much as 6.1 percent to 87.12 euros, the
steepest intraday decline since Sept. 11, and was trading down
5.8 percent at 9:58 a.m. That pared the stock’s gain this year
to 9.5 percent, valuing the Metzingen-based fashion producer at
6.15 billion euros ($8.06 billion).  Permira seeks to dispose of 7 million Hugo Boss shares, or
about 10 percent of the total, in an accelerated bookbuilding,
the London-based private-equity firm said in a statement
yesterday. The stock is offered in a range of 87.50 euros to
88.50 euros a share, down from an earlier proposal of 89.25
euros to 90.50 euros a share, according to a term sheet obtained
by  Bloomberg News .  Permira inherited the stake when it bought a majority
holding in 2007 in Milan-based Valentino Fashion Group SpA, Hugo
Boss’s parent company at the time. Permira sold its Valentino
assets to a group led by Qatari investors in July 2012. The
private-equity firm doesn’t plan to dispose of more shares in
Hugo Boss, according to a person familiar with the matter.  After the transaction is completed, Permira is expected to
retain a 56 percent stake in Hugo Boss, the German company said
in a statement today. Permira currently owns 65.56 percent of
Hugo Boss stock through its Red & Black Holding GmbH unit.
Freely traded stock in the fashion company will represent about
42 percent of the share capital after the disposal, it said.  Hugo Boss  reiterated  its earnings forecast for the year
yesterday after saying its retail business increased sales by 14
percent in the first quarter as it opened more outlets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
