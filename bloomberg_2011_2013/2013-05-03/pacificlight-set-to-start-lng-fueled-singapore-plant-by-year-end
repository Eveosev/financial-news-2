PacificLight Power Pte Ltd. said its
800 megawatt Jurong Island power plant, the first in  Singapore 
to be completely fueled by liquefied natural gas, will be fully
operational by the fourth quarter.  The company’s gas-fired, combined-cycle facility in western
Singapore will sell electricity to customers at prices based on
crude or high-sulfur fuel oil, PacificLight Power said yesterday
in a statement.  “With the opening up of Singapore’s electricity market, an
increasing number of consumers are expecting better  customer
service  and competitive prices,” said Yu Tat Ming, the
company’s chief executive officer.  Malaysia’s Petronas Power Sdn Bhd. owns 30 percent of
PacificLight Power, and 70 percent is held by FPM Power Holdings
Limited, a joint venture of Hong Kong-based First Pacific
Company Ltd. and a unit of Manila Electric Co.  Singapore currently uses piped natural gas from Malaysia
and Indonesia to generate 80 percent of its power, with  fuel
oil , solid waste and solar energy providing the remaining 20
percent, according to the country’s energy regulator, the Energy
Market Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
