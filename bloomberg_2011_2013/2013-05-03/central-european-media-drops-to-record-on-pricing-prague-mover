Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV) , the broadcaster co-owned by Time Warner Inc., slumped the
most in 4 1/2 years after pricing a share offering at a
discount.  The stock  retreated  19 percent, the most since November
2008, to 55.35 koruna by close in  Prague , the biggest drop since
November 2008 and the lowest level since the stock cross-listed
on the Czech bourse in 2005. Traded volume was 14-times the
three-month daily average. The  stock  was down 15 percent to
$2.685 as of 12 p.m. in  New York , its home market.  CME, as the company is known, has slumped 36 percent in
Prague since announcing plans on April 29 to raise as much as
$174 million through a public offering. CME has priced 54.4
million of its Class A common shares at $2.75 apiece, the
Bermuda-registered company said in a regulatory filing today.
The pricing was 13 percent less than yesterday’s closing price
in New York.  “They failed to reach the target of $174 million, which is
clearly negative,” Pavel Ryska, an analyst at J&T Banka AS in
Prague, said in an e-mail to  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
