General Electric Co. (GE) , the U.S. power-equipment supplier, will sell 1.8 billion reais ($895.3 million)
of turbines to Bioenergy Geradora de Energia Ltda., a Brazilian
company seeking to develop the world’s cheapest wind energy.  GE will deliver 207 turbines to 13 of Bioenergy’s projects
in the northeastern state of Maranhao and will furnish another
170 others for future projects, Sao Paulo-based Bioenergy said
today in an e-mailed statement.  GE will invest in a domestic supply chain to be eligible
for a new local-content requirement of national development
lender Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social so
that its turbines can be sold with cheap debt, according to the
statement.  Bioenergy agreed to sell energy from wind farms in a
government-organized auction in December at 87.77 reais a
megawatt-hour, the world’s lowest price for wind power, Eduardo Tabbush, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said Jan.
