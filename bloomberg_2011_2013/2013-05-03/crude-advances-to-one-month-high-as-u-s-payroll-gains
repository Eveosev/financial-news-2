West Texas Intermediate crude surged
to the highest level in a month as U.S. employment rose more
than forecast in April, stoking speculation that demand in the
world’s biggest oil-consuming country will increase.  Prices capped a second weekly advance after the Labor
Department said nonfarm payrolls grew by 165,000 workers last
month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a 140,000
gain. The jobless rate unexpectedly declined to a four-year low
of 7.5 percent. Crude also climbed as U.S. stocks rallied.  “The oil market has broken out and the jobs report is the
biggest catalyst,” said Jeff Grossman, president of  New York- 
based BRG Brokerage and a New York Mercantile Exchange floor
trader. “The stock market is strong and everything is going
higher.”  WTI for June delivery jumped $1.62, or 1.7 percent, to
$95.61 a barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement level since
April 2. The volume of all futures traded was 32 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day. Prices are up 2.8
percent this week.  Crude extended gains after the front-month WTI contract
broke above $95.19, the 76.4 percent retracement level on a
three-month Fibonacci chart.  Brent for June settlement advanced $1.34, or 1.3 percent,
to $104.19 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Volume was 36 percent above the 100-day average.  Brent Premium  Brent’s premium to WTI dropped to $8.58, the narrowest
based on settlement prices since Dec. 30, 2011.  The Labor Department revised the March gain to 138,000 from
the 88,000 estimated last month. Private payrolls, which don’t
include jobs at government agencies, increased by 176,000 in
April after a revised gain of 154,000 the previous month.  “The jobs report is inspiring and it’s bullish for oil,”
said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures
Group in  Chicago . “With jobs numbers being strong, you just
can’t be short on oil. The market is going to be looking to
better demand in the U.S.”  The April jobless rate dropped to the lowest level since
December 2008 from 7.6 percent in March. The rate, which is
derived from a separate poll of households, was forecast to hold
at 7.6 percent, according to the Bloomberg survey median.  “The jobs report seems to be what is driving most of the
markets higher today,” said Chris Barber, a senior analyst at
Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “It
provides a more optimistic economic outlook and, for oil, a
better demand outlook.”  ‘May Accelerate’  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained as much as 1.2
percent as it reached 15,000 for the first time. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rallied as much as 1.3 percent.  The U.S. used 18.8 million barrels a day of oil in 2011, or
21 percent of the world’s consumption, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  “People had been a bit nervous about oil demand and
economic growth,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts. “This
report gives people a sense that maybe the U.S. economy will not
pause, but instead may accelerate in the second quarter.”  Total oil demand  in the U.S. fell 3.6 percent last week to
17.9 million barrels a day, the Energy Information
Administration reported May 1.  ‘Very High’  Crude inventories gained 6.7 million barrels to 395.3
million, the highest level in 82 years, according to the EIA,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  “U.S. oil inventories are very high and demand is still
poor,” Flynn said. “With this improvement in the jobs number,
there is an expectation that demand is going to perk up.”  WTI may drop next week, a Bloomberg survey showed. Sixteen
of 34 analysts and traders, or 47 percent, forecast futures will
decline through May 10. Twelve respondents, or 35 percent,
projected a gain and six said there would be little change.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 22.3 percent, compared with yesterday’s 23.2 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 619,906
contracts as of 3:12 p.m. It totaled 638,298 contracts
yesterday, 9.5 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.76 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
