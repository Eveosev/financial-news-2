U.K. stocks  rose to a seven-week high,
with the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index completing a second week of gains, as a
report showed that U.S. employers hired more workers last month
than economists had forecast.  Commodity producers increased as base metals rallied, with
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the largest mining company, climbing 3.7
percent.  Man Group (EMG)  Plc soared 13 percent on a plan to redeem
debt.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  dropped by the most in
two months after Britain’s biggest state-owned lender reported
operating profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  The FTSE 100 surged 60.75 points, or 0.9 percent, to
6,521.46 at the close of trading in London, the highest level
since March 14. The equity benchmark completed an 11-month rally
in April, its longest stretch of gains since the index started
in 1984. The gauge advanced 1.5 percent this week. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index added 1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index rallied 1.3 percent.  “In the light of some of the cut-backs that the government
has been communicating to the American people lately, these
numbers are good,” said  Michael Morris , who oversees about $1
billion as head of European equities at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset
Management in London. “This supports the view that the  U.S.
economy  is recovering. It’s not an impressive recovery, but it’s
one which is absent from most major economies.”  In the U.S., Britain’s biggest trading partner, payrolls
expanded by 165,000 workers last month following a revised
138,000 increase in March that was larger than first estimated,
Labor Department figures showed. The median forecast of 90
economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected a 140,000 gain.  European Recession  The euro-area economy will shrink more than previously
expected in 2013, the European Commission said in new forecasts
today. Gross domestic product in the 17-nation region will fall
0.4 percent this year, compared with a February prediction of a
0.3 percent drop, the Brussels-based commission said.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 9.9 percent more than the 30-day average today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A gauge of London-listed mining stocks increased the most
in three weeks as base metals gained on the London Metal
Exchange.  BHP Billiton  added 3.7 percent to 1,847.5 pence and
Rio Tinto Group climbed 4 percent to 3,022.5 pence. Eurasian
Natural Resources Corp. rallied 12 percent to 292.7 pence, a
six-week high.  Glencore Xstrata Plc rose 3.9 percent to 343.95 pence on
its first trading day as a combined company.  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  completed a $29 billion takeover of Xstrata
Plc yesterday, forming the world’s biggest zinc miner and
exporter of coal for power stations.  Man Group  Man Group surged 13 percent to 120 pence, the highest price
in more than a year. The world’s largest publicly traded hedge
fund manager may buy back shares or pay a special dividend as it
seeks to reduce its $920 million of surplus capital, Chief
Executive Officer Emmanuel Roman said today.  RBS lost 5.7 percent to 289.8 pence, its biggest decline
since Feb. 28. Operating profit declined to 829 million pounds
($1.3 billion) from 1.16 billion pounds a year earlier, the
lender said in a statement today. That missed the 1.2 billion-
pound estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
