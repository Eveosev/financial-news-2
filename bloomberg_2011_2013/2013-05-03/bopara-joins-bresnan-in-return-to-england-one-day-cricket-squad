Ravi Bopara  and  Tim Bresnan  were
returned to the England cricket squad for the one-day series
against New Zealand and next month’s ICC Champions Trophy.  Captain Alastair Cook will head a side that defeated New
Zealand 2-1 in February. Six members of the squad -- Bopara,
Bresnan, James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Eoin Morgan and Graeme Swann -- were involved in the last International Cricket Council
Champions Trophy in 2009 in South Africa.  “The three-match series against New Zealand will be very
challenging and we will need to play some very good cricket if
we are to repeat the success we had against them,”  Geoff
Miller , the national selector, said today in a statement. “The
ICC Champions Trophy provides this England squad with a great
opportunity to win an global 50-over event, something we have
yet to achieve, and we are excited to be playing on home soil.”  England takes on New Zealand in a three-match one-day
series starting May 31 at Lord’s Cricket Ground in  London . The
team’s ICC matches begin June 8 at Edgbaston, where it takes on
Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
