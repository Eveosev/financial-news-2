French President Francois Hollande
said German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s bid for re-election is
hindering the euro area’s push for a banking union to counter
the debt crisis.  “Ms. Merkel has upcoming elections in September, and
cannot give the impression that she’s taking greater care of
Europeans than of Germans,” Hollande said in an interview in
Paris with The Wall Street Journal that was published today.
“The risk is that  Germany  may want to wait until after its
elections to move ahead on the banking union.”  Europe  is racing to put together the pieces of a financial-
supervisory system under the European Central Bank in to counter
the three-year-old debt crisis, which has led to rescues
totaling 496 billion euros ($650 billion) for five of the 17
euro countries.  Resisting elements of the banking union, German officials
say that the European Union treaty must be amended in order to
complete the plans.  “It would only take Ms. Merkel to say that treaty changes
are not necessary for things to move forward,” Hollande said.
“I am confident that we can always reach a compromise with
Germany.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
