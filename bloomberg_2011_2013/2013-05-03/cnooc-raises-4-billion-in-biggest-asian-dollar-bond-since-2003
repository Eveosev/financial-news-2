Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s largest offshore
energy explorer, sold $4 billion of bonds in the biggest dollar-
denominated offering from Asia outside of  Japan  in more than
nine years.  Investors bid for about $23.8 billion of notes, with asset
managers making up the biggest buyer group for all four tenors,
a person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be
identified because the details are private. U.S. investors took
79 percent of the 10-year issue, the person said.  Aggregate proceeds from the four-part sale will be about
$3.94 billion after commissions and fees, according to Cnooc
estimates in a stock exchange filing dated today. A phone
message left at Cnooc’s Beijing office seeking comment on the
sale and e-mailed questions were not immediately returned.  The oil and natural gas explorer’s offering is the largest
in the U.S. currency in Asia outside Japan since a $5 billion
sale from  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  in November 2003, Bloomberg
data show. Global investors attracted by the state backing and
strategic significance of China’s oil and gas companies
supported a record $6.9 billion of dollar bonds from the
industry last month. The premium Cnooc paid on the 10-year notes
was 35 basis points less than on similar-maturity securities it
issued last year, the data show.  Issue Details  The company issued $2 billion of 3 percent bonds due 2023
to yield 155 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries
and $500 million of 4.25 percent securities due in three decades
with a 150 basis-point spread, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The sale also included equal $750 million portions of
1.125 percent debt due 2016 that pays 95 basis points more than
benchmarks and 1.75 percent, five-year notes with an extra yield
of 120.  The company will use the funds to partly repay a $6 billion
short-term bridge loan the Beijing-based company used to buy
Canadian energy producer Nexen Inc., it said in a separate
filing this week. The $15.1 billion deal was the biggest
overseas takeover by a Chinese company.  Cnooc last sold debt in the U.S. currency in April last
year, offering notes due May 2022 at a spread of 190 basis
points over Treasuries, Bloomberg-compiled data show. It also
sold securities due May 2042 that yielded 190 basis points more
than comparable U.S. government bonds, according to the data.  Cnooc’s sale comes after Petroliam Nasional Bhd. raised
$4.5 billion in August 2009 in a combined bond and sukuk
security offering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
