The European Commission expects
Italy’s economy to begin a “mild” recovery in the third
quarter, while the country’s  debt level  will rise to a record
next year, contradicting a government forecast for a decline.  Italy’s gross domestic product will drop 1.3 percent this
year before expanding 0.7 percent in 2014, the European
Commission, the European Union’s executive body, estimates in a
report published today. “The settlement of government trade
debt arrears is expected to support a mild recovery as from the
third quarter of 2013,” according to the report.  While the Italian government estimates the country’s debt
will peak this year at 130.4 percent of GDP and start declining
from 2014, the commission says the euro-region’s second biggest
debt will continue to rise next year, reaching a record of 132.2
percent.  Italy ’s debt level was inflated by a plan passed last month
to make 40 billion euros ($52.5 billion) in payments over the
next two years owed to government suppliers. The commission said
that the payments will help drive a recovery.  “The settlement of government trade debt arrears is
expected to support a  mild recovery  as from the third quarter of
2013,” the report said. “This is due to its immediate impact
on public investment, while the improved liquidity conditions
for firms will gradually deploy their benefit to the economy
over the forecast horizon.”  The commission forecasts that Italy’s budget deficit will
fall to 2.9 percent in 2013, less than the region’s 3 percent
limit, and shrinking to 2.5 percent next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
