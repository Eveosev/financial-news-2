The pound was little changed versus
the dollar before a report that economists said will show U.K.
services industries expanded for a fourth month in April, adding
to signs the economic recovery is picking up pace.  Sterling was 0.2 percent from its strongest level in more
than three months against the euro. A gauge of activity was at
52.4 last month, the same as in March, Markit Economics and the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply will say today,
according to the median prediction of 27 analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. Reports this
week showed  manufacturing  and construction shrank in April by
less than economists predicted.  The pound traded at $1.5533 as of 7:35 a.m. London time,
after climbing to $1.5606 on May 1, the highest since Feb. 13.
It has appreciated 0.4 percent since April 26. Sterling was at
84.14 pence per euro. It reached 83.98 pence on April 26, the
strongest level since Jan. 24.  Sterling has appreciated 2.6 percent in the past month, the
best performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose 1.5
percent, while the dollar dropped 0.4 percent.  U.K. government bonds returned 2.4 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German bonds gained 1.4 percent and Treasuries earned 1.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
