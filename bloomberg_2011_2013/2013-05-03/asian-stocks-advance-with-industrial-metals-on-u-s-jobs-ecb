U.S. stocks rallied, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 15,000 during the day for the first time, and Treasuries slid as faster-than-forecast employment growth bolstered optimism in the world’s largest economy. Copper surged the most since 2011.  The Dow climbed 142.38 points, or 1 percent, to 14,973.96 at 4 p.m. in New York and surged as high as 15,009.59. The S&P 500 advanced 1.1 percent to 1,614.22, above 1,600 for the first time, and  Germany ’s DAX Index rose 2 percent to close at a record. Ten-year Treasury yields, which fell to the lowest level of the year yesterday, jumped 11 basis points to 1.74 percent for the biggest gain since September. Copper surged 6.8 percent and lead increased 5 percent to lead commodities higher.  U.S. payrolls expanded by 165,000 workers last month and revisions to the prior two months added a total of 114,000 jobs to the employment count. The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey called for an increase of 140,000 positions. The report overshadowed other data showing weaker-than-forecast growth in service industries and a drop in factory orders.  “This certainly gives some indication that there’s life in the economic recovery,” James Dunigan, who helps oversee $112 billion as chief investment officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management, said by telephone. “Recent evidence suggested economic growth was down-shifting in the second quarter. The good news, versus what the market thought, added some confidence here.”  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index decreased to 53.1 in April from 54.4 a month earlier, less than the median economist forecast for a reading of 54. The 4 percent drop in factory orders reported by the Commerce Department was the biggest since August and followed a revised 1.9 percent gain the prior month that was smaller than previously estimated.  Market Movers  Gauges of commodity, industrial, consumer, technology and financial shares rose at least 1 percent to lead gains among eight of the 10 of the main industry groups in the S&P 500. Caterpillar Inc., Alcoa Inc. and 3M Co. climbed at least 1.7 percent for the biggest gains in the Dow.  Kraft Foods Group Inc. climbed 5.1 percent to the highest since the company’s split last year as first-quarter profit beat estimates. American International Group Inc. rallied 5.7 percent, the most this year, after operating earnings surpassed projections.  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD)  tumbled 13 percent after  forecasting  second-quarter sales that missed analysts’ predictions.  The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent yesterday as the European Central Bank cut its key interest rate and U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly fell. The Federal Reserve said May 1 it will keep buying bonds at a monthly pace of $85 billion while standing ready to raise or lower purchases as the economy changes.  ‘Sweet Spot’  “We’re right in the sweet spot,” Darrell Cronk, the New York-based regional chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank, which oversees $170 billion, said by telephone. “The Fed doesn’t have enough data to feel comfortable that they’re ready to exit or taper yet. But the data is strong enough to confirm that the expansion is intact, and the bones of this recovery are where they need to be.”  The benchmark U.S. equities index gained 2 percent over the past five days, a second straight  weekly  advance. The U.S. bull market entered its fifth year in March and the S&P 500 has surged 139 percent from a 12-year low in 2009, driven by better- than-estimated corporate earnings and three rounds of bond purchases by the Fed.  Of the 404 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results so far, 73 percent exceeded analysts’ earnings predictions while 53 percent missed on sales,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show. Profit at S&P 500 companies rose 2 percent in the first three months of the year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Europe Markets  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index extended its weekly gain to 1.7 percent and reached an almost five-year high. BNP Paribas SA added 2.4 percent as  France ’s largest lender reported first- quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc slid 5.7 percent after posting a bigger decline in operating profit than analysts had estimated.  The bonds of Europe’s lower-rated nations pared or reversed gains after rallying earlier. Spain’s two-year note yield was little changed at 1.54 percent after dropping below 1.5 percent for the first time since April 2010. Yields on  Italy ’s benchmark 10-year debt added six basis points to 3.82 percent after sliding to as little as 3.68 percent, the lowest in more than seven years.  Portugal ’s 10-year bond yields declined 15 basis points to 5.50 percent and Greek rates slid 49 basis points to 9.80 percent, the least since 2010 for both.  Copper Surges  Copper rose 6.8 percent to $3.3145 a pound in New York, the biggest increase since October 2011. The U.S. is the biggest buyer of the metal after  China . Zinc increased 3.6 percent to $1,885 a ton, while nickel advanced 3.7 percent to $15,225 a ton. Glencore Xstrata Plc said it will cease production at its Sinclair nickel mine in Western Australia on May 15.  West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose 1.7 percent to $95.61 a barrel after jumping 3.3 percent yesterday. Natural gas fluctuated after the futures tumbled 7 percent yesterday, their biggest drop in nine months.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index rose 0.5 percent today to extend its weekly gain to 2 percent, its best advance since January. The Shanghai Composite Index advanced 1.4 percent, rebounding from a four-month low, and  Russia ’s Micex Index added 2.3 percent.  India ’s Sensex index dropped 0.8 percent as the central bank said there was “little space” for further monetary easing after policy makers cut interest rates for a third consecutive meeting.
