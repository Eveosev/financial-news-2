Sugar fell in  New York  on speculation
prices that rallied as much as 1.7 percent yesterday climbed too
far as the harvest in top grower Brazil accelerates. Cocoa rose.  Sugar gained yesterday as commodities moved higher. The
 Standard & Poor’s GSCI (SPGSCI)  index of 24 raw materials gained 1.9
percent yesterday, the most since Nov. 19. Harvesting in
Brazil’s center south, the country’s main growing region, is
accelerating after rains delayed the start of the season,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd. The area will produce a record
35.5 million metric tons of sugar this year, industry group
Unica estimates.  “New York sugar prices have come under renewed pressure as
the center south Brazilian cane harvest is now fully under
way,”  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie,  Australia ’s biggest
investment bank, wrote in a report. “After a slow start, the
dry weather currently forecast for May should see the harvest
accelerate.”  Raw sugar for delivery in July fell as much as 0.8 percent
to 17.46 cents a pound ICE Futures U.S. and was down 0.2 percent
to 17.57 cents by 6:48 a.m. in New York. Futures trading volumes
were 45 percent lower than the average for the past 100 days for
this time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August fell 0.3 percent
to $499.50 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  The accelerating harvest in  Brazil  is sending down prices
for ethanol, which compete with sugar for raw material sugar
cane, London-based Haque said in the report. The price of
hydrous ethanol, the pure biofuel used in flex-fuel cars, has
fallen to a sugar equivalent of 18.4 cents a pound from over 20
cents a pound in April, she said. That may reduce millers’
incentive to favor ethanol production over sugar.  Sugar Delivery  Cargill Inc., Bunge Ltd. and Wilmar International Ltd. took
delivery this week of about 1.43 million tons of sugar in
transactions to settle the expiration of the May raw futures
contract in New York, the biggest amount in 24 years.  “A massive delivery against the expiry of the May futures
contract should add to the bearish sentiment short term, as
these volumes seek homes,” Haque said. “We continue to expect
sugar to tread lower to 17 cents a pound in the short term.”  Arabica coffee futures for July delivery were little
changed at $1.395 a pound on ICE. Robusta futures for delivery
in July fell 0.2 percent to $2,017 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa for July delivery rose 0.2 percent to $2,418 a ton in
New York. Cocoa for July delivery rose 0.3 percent to 1,575
pounds ($2,451) a ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
