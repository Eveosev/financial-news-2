The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index tumbled 5 basis points to
100.5 basis points as of 9:14 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The gauge is set for its biggest one-day drop
since Feb. 22 and poised for its lowest close since January
2011, according to Westpac and data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 3 basis points to 105 as of 9:01
a.m. in  Singapore , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
prices show. The benchmark is set to fall 5.7 basis points this
week, according to ANZ and CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  Markets in Japan are closed today for a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
