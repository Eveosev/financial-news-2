(Corrects date in first paragraph.)  Hedge-fund managers and other large
speculators decreased their net-long position in unleaded
gasoline futures in the week ended April 30, according to
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Each Friday the CFTC publishes aggregate numbers for long
and short positions for speculators such as  hedge funds  and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculatorsâ€™ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  To contact  Bloomberg News  for this story:
