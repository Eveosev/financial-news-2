CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , the biggest U.S.
options market by volume, reported first-quarter profit that
beat analyst projections amid growth in its volatility and
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index products.  Net income increased 27 percent to $41.8 million, the
Chicago-based company said today in a statement. Earnings
excluding some items were 50 cents a share, exceeding the 47-
cent  average estimate  of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg whose
estimates ranged from 49 cents to 45 cents.  CBOE is working to boost revenue amid a drop in volume and
increasing competition in the listed options market in the U.S.,
where there are now 11 exchanges. Options trading slowed to a
daily average of 15.9 million contracts last year from a ninth-
consecutive record of 18.1 million in 2011,  data  from the
Chicago-based OCC show. So far in 2013, it has averaged 16.6
million.  The  stock  rose 0.6 percent to $37.51 yesterday in  New York 
and it has gained 27 percent in 2013. The Bloomberg World
Exchanges Index, which includes CBOE and 25 of its peers, has
gained 13 percent this year.  Volume of options on CBOE’s volatility measure, known as
the  VIX (VIX) , have climbed to a daily average of more than 610,000
this year, a 37 percent increase from 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Almost 810,000 S&P 500 options traded
each day in 2013 on average, up 15 percent from last year. CBOE
is the exclusive venue for options based on the  volatility 
measure and the  S&P 500 Index. (SPX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
