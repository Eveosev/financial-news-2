Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN) , maker
of the eye medicine Eylea, reported first-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates and increased its U.S. sales forecast
for the drug. The shares rose.  Earnings excluding items such as share-based compensation
expenses were $1.78 a share, the Tarrytown, New York-based
company said in a statement today. Analysts anticipated $1.46,
according to the average of 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Eylea may generate $1.25 billion to $1.33 billion in the
U.S. this year, from a previous outlook of $1.2 billion to $1.3
billion, the company said. The drug received U.S. approval in
November 2011 for wet age-related macular degeneration, a
leading cause of blindness in the elderly, and began to be sold
in the European Union and  Japan  in the fourth quarter. The
medicine, now approved in the U.S. for a second indication,
accounts for the majority of Regeneron’s sales.  “Both U.S. and EU Eylea sales were ahead of consensus,”
Adnan Butt, an analyst with  RBC Capital Markets , wrote in a
research note today. “We like Regeneron for the blockbuster
potential of Eylea and the deep pipeline.”  Regeneron rose 7.1 percent to $266.16 at the close in New
York, its highest price since the company’s shares began trading
in 1991. Regeneron has increased 56 percent this year.  Bayer AG (BAYN) , based in Leverkusen, Germany, partners with
Regeneron to market the drug outside the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
