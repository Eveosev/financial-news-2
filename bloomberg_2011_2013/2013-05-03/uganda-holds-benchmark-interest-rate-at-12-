Uganda’s central bank left its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for a fifth month as  core
inflation  remained above target.  The Bank of Uganda maintained the rate at 12 percent,
Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile told reporters today in
Kampala, the capital. That was in line with forecasts of three
of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Consumer prices rose 3.4 percent in April from a year ago,
down from 4 percent in March, according to the Uganda Bureau of
Statistics. Core inflation, which excludes excludes food crops,
electricity and metered water, slowed to 5.8 percent from 6.8
percent.  “The change in annual inflation is small and core
inflation remains above the target of 5 percent,” Robert
Katabaire, an economist at the Kampala-based Dyer & Blair  Uganda 
Ltd., said by phone before the rate decision.  The 12 percent rate is the lowest since the Bank of Uganda
introduced it as a monetary policy tool two years ago.  Expansion of manufacturing, construction, service sector
and agriculture may spur economic growth in the 12 months
through June to 6-7 percent from 3.4 percent a year earlier,
according to the central bank. The 2011-12 growth rate was the
lowest in 25 years for East Africa’s third-biggest economy,
according to the  Finance Ministry .  The latest growth forecast for Uganda, which relies on
funding from the U.K., U.S., European Union, Denmark, Norway and
Japan for a quarter of its budget, is an upward revision from
4.3 percent forecast after donors cut aid over concerns about
government embezzlement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
