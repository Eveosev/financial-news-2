President  Francois Hollande  needs to
make revamping France’s labor law and pension system a priority
to revive economic growth, the European Commission said.  “France badly needs to unblock its growth potential and
create jobs,” European Economic Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn 
told reporters today in Brussels. The country needs to “put a
renewed and strong emphasis on structural reforms in the labor
market, in the pension systems, by opening up closed professions
and services markets.”  The Commission said today that it expects the  French
economy (FRGEGDPQ)  to shrink 0.1 percent this year and grow 1.1 percent
next year. The French finance ministry expects growth of 0.1
percent this year and 1.2 percent next year.  The Commission is more pessimistic because it expects
weaker household demand and a bigger contraction in business
investment, Rehn said.  France ’s  budget deficit  will amount to 3.9 percent of gross
domestic product this year and 4.2 percent next year if
Hollande’s government doesn’t take further action, the
Commission said today as part of its spring economic forecasts.
Rehn said it was right to give France and Spain more time than
originally planned to reduce its budget shortfall.  “For France and Spain, it is very obvious that it is more
reasonable to have an extension of the correction of the
excessive deficit over two years,” Rehn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
