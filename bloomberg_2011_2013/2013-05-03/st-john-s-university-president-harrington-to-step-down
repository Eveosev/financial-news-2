St. John’s University , recovering from
a financial scandal, said President Donald J. Harrington will
step down at the end of July after 24 years in the job.  Cecilia Chang, a former dean at the second-largest Catholic
college, had been charged with stealing donations intended for
the university, using students as unpaid servants and lying
about her income. Chang committed suicide last year after
testifying at her trial.  Harrington, 67, had been thinking about stepping down “for
quite a while,” and the board and others convinced him to stay,
he wrote in a letter to the St. John’s community, based in the
 New York  City borough of Queens.  “The difficulties for everyone during the past year have
convinced me, after much prayer and reflection, that the time to
leave the presidency has now come,” said Harrington, who is
also a priest.  St. John’s, founded in 1870, has more than 21,000 enrolled
students, according to the school’s  website . Among its alumni
are  Tom Donohue , president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; and
Ray Kelly, New York City’s police commissioner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
