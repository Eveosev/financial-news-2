The number of people killed on U.S.
highways rose in 2012 to end a run of six consecutive declines,
the longest streak in the nation’s history.  Crash fatalities rose 5.3 percent to an estimated 34,080
from a year earlier, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said today in a  report . The jump coincided with
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood’s campaign against
distracted driving.  The fatality rate, or the number of people killed for every
100 million vehicle miles traveled, rose also, from 1.1 to 1.16.
The agency previously pointed to declines in death rates as
evidence of success in promoting safety even when absolute
numbers rose.  The report, which is preliminary until final figures are
released later this year, gave no reason for the increase. The
Governors Highway Safety Association said in a report last month
that motorcyclist deaths increased about 9 percent last year to
more than 5,000, meaning that could have helped spur the total
increase.  The increase in fatalities outpaced a .3 percent rise in
the number of miles driven in the U.S., according to the  Federal
Highway Administration . The number of people killed last year on
U.S. roads was the highest since 2008, which was the third of
six consecutive years of declines.  The U.S. government has tracked deaths on U.S. roads since
1899, when 26 people died in motor-vehicle crashes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
