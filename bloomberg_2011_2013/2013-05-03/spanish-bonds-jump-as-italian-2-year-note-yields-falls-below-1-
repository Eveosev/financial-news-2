Spain ’s  government bonds  rose, with
10-year yields falling below 4 percent for the first time since
2010, amid speculation the  European Central Bank  will take
further steps to stimulate growth.  Italy’s securities also rallied, with yields on two-year
notes dropping below 1 percent for the first time on record,
after the ECB cut its main refinancing rate yesterday and
signaled it was open to a negative deposit rate. German bunds
declined for the first time in three days before a U.S. report
that economists said will show American employers stepped up
hiring in April, limiting demand for safer assets.  “The ECB left the door open for further measures to help
the economy,” said Christian Reicherter, an analyst at DZ Bank
AG in  Frankfurt . “The market is hoping the rate cut will help
the peripheral economies to gain some momentum. Spread
tightening in the periphery is continuing,” he said, referring
to the securities of  Europe ’s high-yield, high-deficit nations.  The Spanish 10-year yield dropped seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 3.97 percent at 9:30 a.m. London time,
after falling to 3.94 percent, the lowest level since May 2010.
The 5.4 percent bond maturing in January 2023 rose 0.53, or 5.30
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,311) face amount, to 111.325.  Italian two-year note yields dropped as much as eight basis
points to 0.94 percent, the lowest on record. The German 10-year
yield climbed two basis points to 1.18 percent after declining
to 1.15 percent yesterday, the lowest since July 23.  ECB Rate  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  cut the key
 interest rate  by 25 basis points to a record 0.5 percent
yesterday and said while there may be “unintended
consequences” from taking the deposit rate negative, the ECB is
“technically ready” and would “address these consequences if
we decide to act.”  ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said policy
makers have no plans at the moment to cut the deposit rate below
zero.  Draghi’s comments about a negative deposit rate yesterday
were “over-interpreted” by financial markets, Nowotny told
reporters in Bratislava, Slovakia, today. “This is one of many
options, but it’s not an option that is relevant for the near
future.”  U.S. payrolls increased by 140,000 workers following a gain
of 88,000 in March, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 90 economists. The jobless rate stayed at
7.6 percent, matching the lowest since December 2008, the survey
showed.  Spanish government bonds returned 8.9 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Italian bonds gained 5.2 percent, while German securities earned
1.4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
