Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak’s
ruling coalition is “almost evenly tied” with the opposition
alliance ahead of a May 5 election, according to an opinion
survey released today.  Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim’s group received backing
from 42 percent of voters, while Najib’s Barisan Nasional
trailed with 41 percent, according to the  Merdeka Center for
Opinion Research . The result of the poll was within the margin
of error of 2.45 percent in the survey of 1,600 people on
peninsula  Malaysia , conducted between April 28 and May 2.  Merdeka estimated that Anwar’s alliance would win 89 seats
and Najib’s coalition would take 85, with two going to smaller
parties and 46 too close to call. Either side needs 112 seats to
command a majority in the 222-member parliament.  Najib’s coalition is facing its biggest test in 55 years of
unbroken rule since Malaysia gained independence from the U.K.
in 1957. The election will be the closest Malaysia has ever had,
Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public
Policy at the National University of Singapore, told Bloomberg
TV today.  Concerns over the  economy  topped the list of election
issues for voters, the survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
