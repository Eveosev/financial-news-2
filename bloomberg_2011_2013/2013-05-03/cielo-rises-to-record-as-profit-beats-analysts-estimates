Cielo SA,  Brazil ’s biggest payments
processor, rose to a record in  Sao Paulo  after first-quarter
profit increased more than analysts estimated.  The shares climbed 1.2 percent to 54.64 reais at 10:44
a.m., the highest price since the Barueri-based company went
public in 2009. Net income advanced 13 percent to 640.9 million
reais ($319 million), or 98 centavos a share, Cielo said
yesterday in a regulatory filing. Nine analysts in a Bloomberg
survey  estimated  adjusted earnings of 610.6 million reais.  Cielo, led by Chief Executive Officer Romulo de Mello Dias,
51, boosted revenue after acquiring Merchant e-Solutions in July
for $670 million to expand in the U.S. Net operating revenue
increased to 1.55 billion reais from 1.2 billion reais a year
earlier.  “The 2013 first-quarter net income was strong,” Banco
Itau BBA analysts including Regina Sanchez wrote in a report
yesterday. “The results do not imply an upside to our short-
term forecasts, but we expect consensus to adjust numbers up and
Cielo to perform accordingly.”  Cielo is maintaining its forecast that net income will
grow 7 percent to 10 percent in 2013, though profit rose faster
in the first quarter, Dias said today on a conference call.  “It’s too early to revise the guidance,” he said.  Transaction volume climbed to 98.8 billion reais from about
88.1 billion reais a year earlier, according to the filing.  Cielo has gained 15 percent this year, compared with a
decline of 8.1 percent for the benchmark  Ibovespa (CIEL3)  index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
