The  Washington Capitals  beat the New
York Rangers 3-1 in the first game of their National Hockey
League playoff series.  Also in an Eastern Conference series opener tonight, the
Ottawa Senators defeated the Montreal Canadiens 4-2.  New Yorkâ€™s Carl Hagelin got the only goal in the first
period at Verizon Center in Washington.  Alex Ovechkin  tied it on
a power play in the second for the Capitals, who led 3-1 within
another eight minutes on goals 46 seconds apart by Marcus
Johansson and  Jason Chimera .  Erik Karlsson put the Senators ahead in the first period at
Bell Centre in Montreal. Goals by Rene Bourque and Brendan
Gallagher in the second made it 2-1 to the Canadiens. The
Senators restored their one-goal advantage in the third on goals
by Jakob Silfverberg and Marc Methot one minute, 53 seconds
apart, and Guillaume Latendresse made it 4-2 to Ottawa with 6:05
left in the game.  The Senators and Canadiens meet again tomorrow in Montreal
for Game 2 in the best-of-seven first-round series, while the
Capitals again host the Rangers the following day.  Also tonight, two Western Conference series resume, with
the St. Louis Blues seeking a 2-0 lead in games against the
defending Stanley Cup champion  Los Angeles Kings , and the
Detroit Red Wings looking to tie their series at 1-1 with the
Anaheim Ducks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
