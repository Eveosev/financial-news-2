Supplies of sour, or high sulfur,
crude oil in Europe will continue to be tight because of the
loss of Iranian and Syrian exports and “strong” refining
margins for  fuel oil , according to JBC Energy GmbH.  “Fuel oil is finding support in arbitrage to Asia,” and
while exports of Urals crude from  Russia  may increase in June,
“the continued loss of the bulk of Iranian and Syrian crude
will keep the sour crude market tight in the region,” a JBC
Energy team of analysts led by  David Wech  in Vienna said in a
report today.  Russian  Urals crude  rose to a discount of 6 cents a barrel
to Dated Brent today in the Mediterranean, the narrowest since
Aug. 20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Urals briefly
traded at a premium to Dated Brent during July and August last
summer. June loading programs for Urals crude in the  Black Sea 
and  Baltic Sea  will be issued later this month.  The recent strength in Urals crude came from “an
impressive array of factors,” including higher fuel oil
refining margins, a tight May loading schedule of Urals and
European Union’s sanctions on Iranian crude, the report said.
JBC also cited the continued unreliability of Iraqi Kirkuk crude
and the return of an estimated 1.4 million barrels a day of
European refining capacity from maintenance versus April.  These factors are “largely expected to remain in place,”
though the high prices for sour feedstock are already weighing
on European margins, JBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
