Billionaire investor  Warren Buffett 
cut his stake in  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  to 4.98 percent after shares of the
U.K.’s largest supermarket company gained this year.  The investor reduced the holding from a last-reported level
of 5.08 percent on Jan. 12, according to a statement today.  Tesco  shares  have risen 9.2 percent this year as the grocer
smartens its supermarkets and hires more staff to revive a
flagging domestic business. The retailer’s market share was 29.9
percent in the 12 weeks ended April 14,  Kantar Worldpanel  said
last month, more than the 29.4 percent it held in the period
ended March 17, though down from 30.7 percent a year earlier.  Tesco rose 0.2 percent to 366.65 pence as of 12:01 p.m. in
London trading, paring a gain of as much as 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
