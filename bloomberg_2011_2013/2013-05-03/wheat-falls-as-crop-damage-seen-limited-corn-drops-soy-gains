Wheat fell for the second time in
three days on speculation that crop damage was less than
expected after freezing, dry weather in the U.S. Great Plains.
Corn also declined, while soybeans advanced.  Yields in  Kansas , the largest producer of winter wheat, and
in northern  Oklahoma  were forecast at 41.1 bushels an acre,
according to participants in an annual three-day crop tour that
surveyed 570 fields through yesterday. Last year, Kansas farmers
harvested 42 bushels an acre. Some analysts had expected a
bigger drop in yields, after the worst drought since the 1930s
and freezing weather during the past month.  “The wheat tour numbers weren’t as bullish as expected,”
Jamey Kohake, a broker and branch manager at Paragon Investments
in  Silver Lake , Kansas, said by telephone. “It looks like the
crop is OK. There are pockets that are horrendous, but as a
whole, it should be OK.”  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 1 percent to $7.215 a
bushel at 10:02 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price
last month gained 6.3 percent on expectations that the drought
and freeze had done more damage to crops.  On the Kansas City Board of Trade, wheat futures fell 1.4
percent to $7.795 a bushel, heading for the biggest drop since
April 26. Rainfall and warmer weather this month may boost crops
in Kansas and Oklahoma, INTL FCStone said in a report today.  Corn futures for July delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$6.6025 a bushel in  Chicago . The price through yesterday had
gained 6.8 percent this week.  Soybean futures for July delivery gained 1.5 percent to
$13.9225 a bushel in Chicago, the first advance since April 29.
The price last month dropped 0.4 percent, the third straight
decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
