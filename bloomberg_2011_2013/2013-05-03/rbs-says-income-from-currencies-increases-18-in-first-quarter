Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest state-owned lender, said income from
currencies climbed 18 percent during the first quarter as
volatility increased.  Foreign-exchange income rose to 192 million pounds ($299
million) from 163 million pounds in the previous three months,
the company said in a  statement . The result was still lower than
a year earlier, when it was 246 million pounds.  “The increase in currencies was partly driven by an
increase in volumes as clients responded to greater
volatility,” RBS said. The decline from a year earlier was due
to “margin compression and subdued volumes,” it said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Global FX Volatility Index rose 11
percent in the first quarter, the biggest gain since the three
months ending September 2011. The gauge climbed to an eight-
month high of 9.88 in February and was at 8.53 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
