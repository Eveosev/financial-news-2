A bomb from World War II was found
during construction work at the Frankfurt Trade Fair yesterday.  The 500-kilogram (1,100 pound) bomb currently poses no risk
to the public and a decision on when it will be defused will be
made today, Frankfurt police said on its  website .  Frankfurtâ€™s trade fair grounds, one of the largest in the
world, are situated close to the main train station and along a
major route from the city center to the highway. U.S. and
British aerial bombs are routinely unearthed on German
construction sites almost 70 years after the end of the war.  The international meat industry trade fair  IFFA  is
scheduled to begin tomorrow and last until May 9. The last IFFA
event in 2010 attracted 58,000 visitors, according to its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
