Corn and wheat headed for the biggest
weekly advances since July as planting in the U.S., the largest
exporter of the grains, slowed and crop conditions deteriorated
on wet weather. Soybeans climbed.  Wheat for July delivery rose 0.3 percent to $7.31 a bushel
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 10:15 a.m. in  Singapore , set to
gain 5.6 percent this week. Corn for July delivery was little
changed at $6.6125 a bushel, headed for a 6.7 percent advance
this week. Corn settled at $6.62 yesterday, the highest close
for the most-active contract since March 28.  Wheat output in  Kansas , the biggest U.S. grower of winter
varieties, will fall 18 percent to 313.1 million bushels in 2013
after drought last year was followed by an April freeze, surveys
from a three-day annual crop tour showed. Production in  Oklahoma 
may decline 45 percent from a year earlier. Just 5 percent of
the U.S. corn crop was  planted  as of April 28, below the five-
year average of 31 percent, Department of Agriculture data show.  “The key driver remains the less-than-favorable weather
we’re seeing in many parts of the world, headlined by the
particularly slow pace of planting in the U.S. corn belt,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , said by phone from Sydney.  Temperatures may drop below freezing in northwest Oklahoma,
southwest Kansas and eastern Colorado tonight, Commodity Weather
Group LLC said yesterday in a report.  Wheat for July delivery on the Kansas City Board of Trade
traded little changed at $7.8975 a bushel, up 5.2 percent this
week. In Chicago, soybeans for July delivery gained 0.4 percent
to $13.7775 a bushel, trimming a second weekly decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
