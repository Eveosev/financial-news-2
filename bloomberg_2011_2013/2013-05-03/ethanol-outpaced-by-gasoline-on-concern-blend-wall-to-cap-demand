Ethanol fell versus gasoline on
concern that lackluster fuel demand will limit how much of the
biofuel can be blended into petroleum.  The spread, or price difference, widened 0.48 cent to 26.64
cents a gallon.  Gasoline demand over the past four weeks  was
8.51 million barrels a day, a rate that would use 130.4 billion
gallons in a year. Ethanol is blended with the motor fuel in a
formula of as much as 10 percent and the U.S. has a mandate this
year to use 13.8 billion gallons of the motor fuel, a phenomenon
known as the blend wall.  “The only thing that worries me is the gasoline demand
category,” said  Jason Ward , an analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investments Inc. in  Minneapolis . “It’s key because if you start
fading on gasoline demand, you will be capped. You won’t use as
much ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 4 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.559 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The
May contract, which expires today, slipped 1 cent to $2.703.  Gasoline for June delivery advanced 4.48 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.8254 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  If gasoline demand remains poor, it shrinks the pool in
which ethanol can be blended, Ward said.  Ethanol Blending  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 96 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline supply in the week ended April 26, up from
93 percent the previous week and the most since April 5, EIA
said yesterday.  The U.S. is required to use 14.4 billion gallons of ethanol
next year. Each gallon of biofuel is assigned a Renewable
Identification Number, or RIN, to track compliance between the
government and refiners. Once blenders mix renewable fuel with
petroleum they can maintain the credit or trade it.  Concern about the blend wall has prompted an increase in
the value of the certificates.  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  said yesterday
that it expects to spend $120 million in ethanol RINs this year
and that it entered into the export market from the East Coast
to reduce its exposure.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  decreased 2 percent to 75 cents, up
from 7 cents on Jan. 2, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcanes ethanol, decreased 2.4 percent to 83 cents. They
traded at 55 cents on Jan. 2.  RIN Effects  Ethanol advocates and petroleum interests are battling
about the effects of RINs on gasoline prices and whether the
mandate should be repealed. The Environmental Protection Agency
in 2011 approved blends of as much as 15 percent ethanol in
gasoline for vehicles made after 2001.  Oil companies  have resisted using the higher concentrations
of ethanol, saying more testing is needed on its effect on
engines.  Corn for May delivery gained 2 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$6.995 a bushel in Chicago.  The corn crush spread for may was 16 cents a gallon, down
from 18 cents yesterday. That compares with minus 35 cents on
Dec. 31. The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production,
which can be fed to livestock.  Stockpiles of the fuel fell 3.2 percent to 17 million
gallons last week, a May 1 Energy Information Administration
report showed, while  production  expanded 0.5 percent to 857,000
barrels a day, the highest level since June.  Imports of the fuel last week dropped to none from 39,000
barrels a day the previous week, the Energy Department’s
analytical arm said.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.58 a gallon as of
April 26, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol gained 4 cents to $2.80 a
gallon in  New York , 4 cents to $2.66 in Chicago, 4 cents to
$2.72 in the U.S. Gulf and 5 cents to $2.82 on the West Coast,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
