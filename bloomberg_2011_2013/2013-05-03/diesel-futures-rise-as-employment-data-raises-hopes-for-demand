Ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures
climbed along with crude after U.S. employment grew more than
expected in April, stoking optimism that economic growth will
spur demand. Cracks were mixed.  Futures gained as much as 1.4 percent. Payrolls expanded by
165,000 workers last month, following a revised 138,000 increase
in March that was larger than first estimated, Labor Department
figures showed today in  Washington . The median forecast of 90
economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected a 140,000 gain.  “I don’t think anyone was expecting this big an increase
with the jobs number,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil
Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “It’s the first time in a
long time that macro strategists can say it’s a good jobs report
that might translate into higher demand for oil products.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for June delivery gained 2.54
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.8809 a gallon at 9:46 a.m. on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 23 percent
below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus June West Texas Intermediate
crude widened 6 cents to $26 a barrel. The  spread  versus Brent
gained 1 cent to $17.09.  Gasoline for June delivery strengthened 1.45 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.7941 a gallon on the Nymex on volume that was 19
percent below the 100-day average.  The fuel’s  premium  over June West Texas Intermediate
slipped 30 cents to $22.50 a barrel. The  spread  to Brent
weakened 35 cents to $13.59.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.3 cent to
