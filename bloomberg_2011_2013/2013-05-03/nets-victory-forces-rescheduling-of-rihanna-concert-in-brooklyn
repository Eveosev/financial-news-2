The  Brooklyn  Nets’ 95-92 playoff
victory over the  Chicago Bulls  last night forced the
postponement of a Rihanna concert scheduled for the same night
as the series-deciding Game 7 at Barclays Center.  A stop on the Barbados singer’s “Diamonds World Tour,”
originally set for tomorrow at the Brooklyn arena was pushed to
May 7, according to a  release  on the center’s website. The Nets
have twice staved off elimination after trailing 3-1 in the
best-of-seven National Basketball Association playoff series and
will host Game 7 tomorrow night at 8 p.m. New York time.  Brett Yormark, chief executive officer for both the arena
and the Nets, apologized to Rihanna’s fans.  “I want to thank Rihanna for working with us on this new
date and for understanding what a Game 7 in Brooklyn means to
the borough,” Yormark said in the statement.  Tickets for the original date will be honored on the new
night, according to the release. Refunds also will be available
at the original point of purchase.  A five-time Grammy Award winner, Rihanna is the only female
artist of the past 10 years to have at least 10 songs top
Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, according to her website. The 25-
year-old is managed by  Roc Nation , the entertainment company
founded by rapper Jay-Z, who is a minority owner in the Nets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
