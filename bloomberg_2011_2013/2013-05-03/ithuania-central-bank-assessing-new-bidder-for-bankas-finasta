Lithuania ’s central bank said it’s
reviewing the qualifications of a group of companies and persons
that want to buy the Finasta investment banking unit of bankrupt
Bankas Snoras AB and remains open to other bidders.  The Bank of Lithuania will decide by July 26 on a request
by “EurEst Capital OU with a group of legal and physical
persons” for permission to buy  Bankas Finasta AB , the central
bank in Vilnius, the capital, said today in an e-mailed
statement. It didn’t further identify the bidder.  “This assessment of documents doesn’t prevent other
possible investors from applying,” central bank Chairman Vitas Vasiliauskas said in the statement.  Snoras, once Lithuania’s third-biggest bank by deposits,
was declared bankrupt and taken over by the central bank in
November 2011 after assets were discovered missing from its
balance sheet. Bankruptcy administrator Neil Cooper has said
that completing the sale of companies in the Finasta group is
among the bankruptcy administrator’s top priorities this year.  The central bank rejected one unnamed investor’s request
for approval to buy the assets, the  Baltic News Service  reported
Jan. 21, citing Cooper.  Omada Capital , a London-based investment fund that
expressed interest in Finasta last year, said on Jan. 23 that it
still planned to submit an application to buy the unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
