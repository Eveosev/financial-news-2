It's no secret that the McCains own somewhat of a real estate empire. At the time of John McCain's run for president, the Arizona senator owned several  homes in Arizona ,  three in California  and  one in Virginia ,  for a total of seven properties . Right before McCain entered the presidential race, the count was at eight. He and his wife, Cindy, also owned her childhood  home in Phoenix . The couple spent 20 years at the residence, raising their family there. They sold the home in 2006 for $3.2 million to real estate investor Jane Popple, who turned it around and listed it just two years later for $12 million.  Popple had updated the home in a "Tuscan style"  with new floors, finishes and furnishings, as well as adding a theater room and an enormous garage with 4-bedroom guest suite. Popple didn't get her asking price. After major price cuts, the home was slated to go to auction at $10 million, but even then failed to attract a buyer. Shortly after, the home was offered as a short sale and according to property records, finally sold for $1.8 million in 2011. The new owners are apparently trying their luck in a stronger housing market, first listing the estate for $3.5 million in spring and summer of 2012. After a brief hiatus from the open market over the holidays, the house is listed again, this time at $2.9 million. Located at  7110 N Central Ave, Phoenix, AZ, 85020 , the compound measures 14,383 square feet, with 7 bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms in the main house and an additional 2 bedrooms, each in a guest house. The 2-acre, gated property features sprawling lawns and patios, a swimming pool with spa and two ramadas. The massive master suite opens out to a private patio and spa. An  estimated monthly payment  on a piece of Arizona history would be $10,182, assuming a 20 percent down payment on a  30-year loan . The listing is held by  Walt Danley  of  Walt Danely Realty .
