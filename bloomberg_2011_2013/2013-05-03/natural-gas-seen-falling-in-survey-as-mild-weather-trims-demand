Natural gas futures may decline next
week as mild weather in the lower 48 states limits demand for
the heating and power-plant fuel, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Seven of 12 analysts, or 58 percent, predicted that futures
will fall on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through May 10.
Four, or 33 percent, said gas will stay the same and one said
prices will rise. Last week, 73 percent of participants said gas
would decline.  Temperatures will be seasonal across most of the U.S. from
May 7 through May 11, with warmer-than-normal readings in the
Northeast and Northwest, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  Electricity generators  last month
consumed 17.5 billion cubic feet a day of gas, down 27 percent
from the average in April 2012, when prices fell to a 10-year
low, according to LCI Energy Insight, an energy analysis and
consulting company in El Paso,  Texas .  “With heating demand falling off seasonally, I think we’ll
begin to notice that power-utility demand is falling short of
the record 2012 levels,”  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi
Futures Perspective in New York, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Natural gas futures slid 12.7 cents, or 3.1 percent, to
$4.025 per million Btu during the first four days of the week in
New York. Prices are up 20 percent this year.  Inventory Gain  Futures dropped 7 percent yesterday, the biggest one-day
decline in nine months, after a government report showed a
bigger-than-forecast supply gain last week.  U.S. inventories  rose by 43 billion cubic feet to 1.777
trillion in the week ended April 26, below the five-year average
gain of 67 billion for the period, the Energy Information
Administration said.  Analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg
predicted an increase of 29 billion.  A  supply deficit  versus the historic norm widened to 6.2
percent from 5.1 percent, the biggest such gap since February
2011, according to data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 50 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex gas futures will probably
rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This week’s
results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  1      7      4  To contact the reporter on this story:
