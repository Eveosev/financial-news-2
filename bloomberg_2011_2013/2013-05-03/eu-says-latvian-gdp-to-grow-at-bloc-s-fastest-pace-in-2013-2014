Latvia’s  economy  will grow at the
fastest pace in the European Union this year and next, driven by
exports, the 27-member bloc’s executive arm said.  Gross domestic product will rise 3.8 percent in 2013 and
4.1 percent in 2014, the European Commission said today in its
spring economic forecasts. Consumer prices will advance 1.4
percent this year and 2.1 percent next, it predicted.  The Baltic country, which plans to adopt the euro in 2014,
grew by more than 5 percent in each of the last two years after
a slump that began in 2008 triggered a bailout and erased more
than a quarter of output. The nation meets all the criteria to
adopt the common currency on Jan. 1, according to Prime Minister
Valdis Dombrovskis.  “Despite the volatile external environment, the Latvian
economy retained a strong growth path,” the commission wrote.
“The most recent high-frequency indicators, in particular
industrial and retail sales, confirm the previously expected
slowdown in 2013 but nevertheless the country is still likely to
remain among the fastest growing in  Europe .”  Unemployment will fall to 13.7 percent this year and 12.2
percent in 2014, the commission estimates. The budget deficit
will stay at 1.2 percent of GDP in 2013 and narrow to 0.9
percent next year, it predicts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
