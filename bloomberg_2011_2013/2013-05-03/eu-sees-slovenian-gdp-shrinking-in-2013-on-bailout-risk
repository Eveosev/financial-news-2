Slovenia’s recession will stretch into
next year on weak domestic demand as the euro-area country
teeters on the brink of needing an international bailout, the
 European Commission  said.  Gross domestic product will contract 2 percent in 2013 and
0.1 percent in 2014 as rising unemployment affects private
consumption, the commission said in its spring economic
forecasts, published today in Brussels. Inflation will remain
“subdued” at 2.2 percent in 2013 and 1.4 percent in 2014.  Slovenia, the only euro-using nation along with Cyprus
predicted to still be in recession in 2014, is working to fix
its ailing banking industry with a 900 million-euro ($1.2
billion) capital boost and the creation of a so-called bad bank
to cleanse lenders’ balance sheets and aid an economic recovery.
A detailed overhaul plan is set to be presented to the European
Commission in Brussels by May 9.  “Risks to growth are tilted to the downside,” the
commission said. “Further delays in resolving the banking
crisis and restructuring the highly indebted corporate sector
have already resulted in a downward revision of growth
forecasts.”  Any more delay in “required bold structural reforms”
would lower further the country’s growth prospects, the
commission said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Jasmina
