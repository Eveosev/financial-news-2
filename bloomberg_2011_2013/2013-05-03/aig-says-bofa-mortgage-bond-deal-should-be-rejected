Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s proposed
$8.5 billion settlement with mortgage-bond investors should be
rejected by a New York court,  American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
said.  The settlement amount is “unreasonably and unjustifiably
small,” a group of other investors led by AIG said in a filing
today in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. “The
resulting settlement is a pennies-on-the dollar bargain for BofA
that woefully undercompensates” investors, they said.  The settlement would resolve claims from investors in
Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage bonds. Bank of America,
based in Charlotte, North Carolina, acquired the home lender in
2008. The trustee,  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , will seek
court approval for the deal at a hearing set to begin May 30.  Separately, the  Federal Housing Finance Agency , which
regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said it was withdrawing
its “conditional objection” in the case and won’t present
evidence opposing the settlement.  The case is In the matter of the application of the Bank of
 New York  Mellon, 651786-2011, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
