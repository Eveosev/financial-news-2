European stocks advanced to the
highest level since June 2008 as a report showed U.S. employment
in April picked up more than forecast and the jobless rate
unexpectedly dropped to a four-year low.  Adidas AG (ADS)  rose to the highest price since it sold shares to
the public in 1995 after first-quarter profit topped analysts’
estimates.  Vallourec (VK)  SA, a producer of steel pipes for the oil
and gas industry, soared 12 percent. Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc fell the most in two months as first-quarter operating
profit missed forecasts.  Hugo Boss AG (BOSS)  lost 6.1 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 1.1 percent to 301.04 at
the close of trading, extending its weekly rise to 1.7 percent.
The gauge yesterday climbed to a seven-week high as the  European
Central Bank  lowered its benchmark interest rate and companies
posted better-than-expected earnings. The equity measure
completed an 11th month of gains in April, its longest winning
streak since 1997.  “The jobs data was not just a positive surprise, it was a
relief that the labor market in the U.S. is continuing its
recovery,” said Thomas Lehr, an investment strategist at Credit
Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “Investors are not as skeptical
anymore, after some shaky weeks with some disappointing economic
data and earnings. The world looks a bit better now -- along
with the continued central bank stimulus. The rally looks set to
go on in May.”  U.S. Payrolls  In the U.S., a Labor Department report showed that payrolls
expanded by 165,000 workers last month following a revised
138,000 increase in March that was larger than first estimated.
Economists on average had forecast a gain of 140,000 in April.
Revisions to the prior two months’ reports added a total of
114,000 jobs to the employment count in February and March.  The jobless rate fell to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent a
month earlier. That’s the lowest since December 2008. Economists
had forecast that the rate would remain unchanged.  The European Commission said the euro-area economy will
shrink more in 2013 than previously expected. Gross domestic
product in the 17-nation region will decline 0.4 percent,
compared with a February prediction of a 0.3 percent drop. This
follows a 0.6 percent contraction in 2012 and shows the region
headed for its first ever back-to-back years of falling output.  National benchmark indexes rose in all western European
markets except  Greece , which was closed for Orthodox Easter. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.9 percent and  France ’s CAC 40 added 1.4
percent.  Germany ’s DAX climbed 2 percent to a record high.  Adidas Profit  Adidas advanced 7.6 percent to 85.50 euros. First-quarter
net income of 308 million euros ($404 million) beat the average
298.5 million-euro analyst projection. The company also said its
gross margin widened to a record.  Vallourec soared 12 percent to 40.39 euros, the most since
January 2005. First-quarter earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization totalled 191 million euros,
exceeding the average 178 million-euro analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  CGGVeritas (CGG)  surged 12 percent to 18.69 euros as the largest
seismic surveyor of oilfields posted first-quarter net income of
$79 million, following a loss of $3 million a year earlier. The
Paris-based company said it expects a 25 percent-increase in
full-year sales and positive  cash flow .  Sky Deutschland AG, the German pay-TV provider controlled
by  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp., climbed 7.5 percent to 4.85
euros after posting an unexpected operating profit in the first
quarter. Analysts on average had predicted a loss.  RBS (RBS)  dropped 5.7 percent to 289.8 pence, after Britain’s
largest state-owned lender said operating profit fell to 829
million pounds ($1.3 billion) in the first quarter. That missed
the 1.2 billion-pound estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Hugo Boss  declined 6.2 percent to 87.04 euros, its biggest
loss since Sept. 11, as majority owner Permira Advisers LLP sold
7 million shares, or about a 10 percent stake, in the German
luxury-clothing maker. The sale was priced at the lower end of a
revised price range of 87.50 euros to 88.50 euros, two people
familiar with the matter said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
