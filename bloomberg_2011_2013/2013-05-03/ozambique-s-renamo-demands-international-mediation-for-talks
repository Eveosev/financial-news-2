Mozambique’s main opposition party
called for international mediation in talks with the government
to resolve a political crisis after a series of attacks in which
eight people died last month.  “We demand  Southern African Development Community  and
European Union observers and national facilitators to mediate
the dialogue,” Simon Macuiane, the lead negotiator for
Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo, told reporters in the
capital, Maputo, yesterday. “We also need the police to
withdraw from positions surrounding Renamo’s headquarters and
release 15 militiamen.”  Renamo fought a 15-year civil war against the ruling Front
for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, that ended in
1992. Renamo claimed responsibility for last month’s attacks,
and last year threatened to resume the conflict amid complaints
that elections in 2009 were unfair.  Agriculture Minister Jose Pacheco, who heads the
government’s delegation to the talks, told reporters Renamo’s
demands should be considered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
