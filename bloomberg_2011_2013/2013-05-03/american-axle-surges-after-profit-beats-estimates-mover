American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings
Inc. (AXL)  rose the most in 17 months after the maker of axles and
crankshafts reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  The shares rose 7.9 percent to $14.82 at the close in  New
York , the biggest one-day increase since Nov. 30, 2011. The
Detroit-based company’s stock has gained 32 percent this year
compared with a 13 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  A rebounding housing market, relatively stable fuel prices
and new vehicles such as Chrysler Group LLC’s Ram 1500 and
General Motors Co.’s Silverado and Sierra, which the company
supplies, are giving American Axle cause for optimism, Chief
Financial Officer Michael Simonte said in an interview. Full-
size pickup sales have increased 24 percent this year through
April, according to researcher Autodata Corp.  “The market is setting up for very strong pickup sales
trends,” Simonte said. “We are pleasantly surprised by the
strength in the pickup market.”  American Axle, formerly owned by the predecessor of  General
Motors Co. (GM) , has been trying to widen its customer base while
strengthening its balance sheet. The company reported first-
quarter profit of 23 cents a share, excluding debt refinancing
and redemption costs compared with the 16-cent average estimate
of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. During the period,
American Axle issued $400 million of 6.25 percent notes due in
2021, according to a statement today.  Net income tumbled 86 percent to $7.3 million, or 10 cents
a share, from $51.2 million, or 68 cents, a year earlier, the
company said.  First-quarter sales rose less than 1 percent to $755.6
million. Sales to customers other than GM declined to $188.1
million compared with $193.6 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
