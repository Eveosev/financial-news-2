All-Star center  Sidney Crosby  will
make his postseason debut tonight when the Pittsburgh Penguins
host the New York Islanders in the second game of their National
Hockey League playoff series.  Crosby said today on the team’s website that he was cleared
to play after missing 13 games with a broken jaw. The top seed
in the Eastern Conference, the Penguins beat the Islanders 5-0
to open the best-of-seven series on May 1.  Crosby was injured during a March 30 game and didn’t return
to team practices until April 26. At the time of the injury, he
led the NHL with 56 points, with 15 goals and a league-best 41
assists in 36 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
