Two former  day traders  who were
convicted of trading on stock tips gleaned from the wife of a
former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. salesman settled claims by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Jamil Bouchareb agreed to pay $1 million and Daniel Corbin
$191,000 to settle an SEC lawsuit. The men pleaded guilty to
trading on confidential information passed by  Matthew Devlin ,
the former Lehman salesman, whose wife worked on corporate deals
as a public relations executive. Devlin’s wife wasn’t charged.  Bouchareb pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud
in May 2009. Corbin pleaded guilty in May 2011 to the same
charges.  Bouchareb was sentenced to 30 months. Corbin got six
months. The SEC settlements come in addition to the $1.6 million
Bouchareb was ordered to forfeit in the criminal case and
Corbin’s $1 million criminal forfeiture.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Devlin,
08-cv-01101, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
