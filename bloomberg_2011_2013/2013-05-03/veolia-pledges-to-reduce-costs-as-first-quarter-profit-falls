Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , Europe’s
biggest water company, reported a 1.5 percent slump in profit,
and said it’s raising a cost-cutting target.  Adjusted operating income fell to 405 million euros ($529.4
million) in the first quarter from a restated 411.1 million
euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said today in a
statement.  Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot is seeking to turn
the utility around by lowering debt and improving profitability
on contracts. He has pledged to increase Veolia’s reliance on
industrial contracts, shrink its global footprint and focus on
“high growth” economies like China and the  Middle East .  Veolia raised its goal for cost cuts to 750 million euros
by 2015 from a previous 470 million euros, according to today’s
statement. It reiterated asset sales of 6 billion euros for the
2012 to 2013 period, and said it would pay a dividend of 70
centimes a share for each of the two years.  Net financial debt totaled 10.1 billion euros at the end of
March, down from a restated 10.8 billion euros at the end of
2012. Veolia has said it sees net borrowing at no more than 9
billion euros by year-end.  Veolia in March announced the sale of its water and
wastewater business in  Portugal  to  Beijing Enterprises Water
Group Ltd. (371)  for 95 million euros. The utility plans to sell small
and mid-sized assets in 2013, Chief Financial Officer Pierre- Francois Riolacci said in February.  Former CEO  Henri Proglio ’s expansion spree, begun in 2006,
took the company to 77 nations. The utility, which now plans to
narrow its reach to about 40 countries, reduced the number to 48
by the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
