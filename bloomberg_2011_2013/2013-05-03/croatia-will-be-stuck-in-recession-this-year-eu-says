The recession in  Croatia , which will
join the European Union in July, will continue this year as
private consumption and investment fall before returning to
modest growth in 2014, the  European Commission  said.  Gross domestic product will contract 1 percent in 2013 as
domestic demand continues to decline, while net exports will
provide “limited support’ to growth of 0.2 percent in 2014, the
European Union’s executive arm said in its spring economic
forecast published today in Brussels.  The Adriatic nation is struggling to emerge from a renewed
recession as 2012 foreign direct investment shrank to a fifth of
the $4.2 billion in 2008 because of  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis. The former Yugoslav republic stands to receive 10
billion euros ($13 billion) in EU funds through 2020, which the
government plans to channel into infrastructure and tourism.  ‘‘While EU entry may be expected to provide support for the
economy, in the very short term, the cross-currents currently
buffeting the economy will remain a major drag on growth,” the
commission said. The risks are “mainly tilted to the
downside.”  “Tight financial conditions may weigh more heavily than
expected on investment,” it said. “In addition, in the wake of
EU accession, Croatian firms may feel heightened competitive
pressures from firms elsewhere in the EU.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
