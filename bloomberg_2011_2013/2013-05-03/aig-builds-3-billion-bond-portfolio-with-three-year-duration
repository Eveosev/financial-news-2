American International Group Inc. (AIG)  said
it started a new portfolio of bonds at the parent company in the
first quarter as the insurer cuts holdings of cash and short
term investments.  “We initiated an investment program at the holding company
whereby we invested $2.3 billion of available cash into high
quality fixed-maturity securities, with a duration of just over
three years, and a yield rate of just over 1 percent,” Chief
Financial Officer David Herzog said on a conference call today.
“We expect this portfolio to grow to around $3 billion this
year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
