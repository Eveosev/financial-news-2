Dun & Bradstreet Inc. (DNB) , the 171-year-
old provider of business data and risk-management services, said
Sara Mathew will retire as chief executive officer and chairman
by May of next year.  The board has hired executive-search firm  Spencer Stuart  to
help find a new leader, the  Short Hills , New Jersey-based
company said today in a statement. Dun & Bradstreet said it will
consider both internal and external candidates.  “I have had the privilege of working with a very talented
team over the past 12 years to lead the transformation of D&B
from a data provider to a big data, insights and analytics
company,” Mathew, 57, said in the statement.  The company is seeking a new CEO at a time when it’s still
struggling to revive growth. Sales dropped 5 percent last
quarter, marking the fifth straight period of year-over-year
declines. Dun & Bradstreet also made a failed attempt to find a
buyer for the company last year, Reuters reported in November.  Dun & Bradstreet shares rose 1.1 percent to $90 at the
close in  New York . The stock has climbed 14 percent this year.  Mathew joined Dun & Bradstreet in 2001 as chief financial
officer after 18 years at Procter & Gamble Co. She became CEO
and chairman in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
