The euro gained versus the dollar and
yen after European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said markets over-interpreted a signal yesterday that
the ECB would consider a deposit rate below zero.  The 17-member currency yesterday dropped the most in more
than two weeks versus the greenback after central bank President
 Mario Draghi  said policy makers have an “open mind” on
reducing their so-called deposit rate below zero for the first
time. Policy makers have “no plan in this direction,” Nowotny
said in an interview with CNBC today. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  fell
before a U.S. report that economists said would show American
employers stepped up hiring in April.  The euro advanced 0.2 percent to $1.3089 at 8:30 a.m.
London time. It strengthened 0.4 percent to 128.51 yen. The
dollar rose 0.3 percent to 98.18 yen.  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, fell 0.2 percent to 82.099.  Payrolls increased by 140,000 workers after an 88,000 gain
in March, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before a Labor Department report. The
 unemployment rate  stayed at 7.6 percent, matching March’s
reading as the lowest since December 2008, according to a
separate survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
