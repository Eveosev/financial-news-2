  Robert Kelly , former  Bank of New York
Mellon Corp.  chief executive officer, was named chairman of the
Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. in the government’s latest move
to bolster oversight of the federal housing agency.  “Mr. Kelly has extensive Canadian and U.S. experience in
both housing finance and capital markets, which will be of great
benefit to CMHC,” Human Resources Minister Diane Finley said in
a statement today. “His expertise and leadership will ensure
the continued strong governance of Canada’s national housing
agency.”  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  gave new powers last year to
the nation’s banking regulator to oversee CMHC’s finances and
added two government deputy ministers to the agency’s board of
directors.  Most mortgage insurance in Canada is provided by CMHC,
which is backed by the federal government’s top credit rating.  Kelly, a native of Halifax,  Nova Scotia , was chairman and
chief executive officer of Bank of  New York  Mellon from 2007 to
2011. He is chancellor of St. Mary’s University in Halifax.  To contact the reporters on this story:
