The  Howard G. Buffett  Foundation will
donate $5 million to help develop a hydro power project in
Democratic Republic of Congo’s  Virunga National Park , home to a
quarter of the world’s remaining endangered mountain gorillas.  Two hydro plants will generate 15 megawatts of electricity
for small-scale agricultural businesses and over a million
people around the park, an e-mailed statement dated May 1 from
the foundation, which is run by the son of billionaire investor
 Warren Buffett , said. Construction will finish by 2015, it said.  “Over time, profits from the sale of electricity will
support up to 40 percent of Virunga National Park’s basic
operating costs,” it said. The grant is part of a two-year, $50
million commitment by the foundation to support food security,
economic development and mitigate conflict in eastern Congo, it
said.  Virunga is  Africa ’s oldest national park and a UNESCO World
Heritage site. Over the past two decades, ongoing conflict in
Congo’s east has damaged the park and decimated the animal
population, which also includes hippopotamuses, lowland gorillas
and chimpanzees.  The M23 rebel group, which has fought with Congo’s national
army for more than a year in North Kivu province, controls
territory that includes parts of Virunga.  Congo is considering opening up parts of the park to oil
exploration. Both  Soco International Plc (SIA)  and  Total SA (FP)  have
licenses that overlap with the park. Total has pledged not to
conduct exploration activities inside Virunga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
