Thai  interest-rate swaps  are set for
the biggest weekly decline since September 2011 and  government
bonds  rallied on speculation the central bank will lower
borrowing costs to stem capital inflows.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said yesterday he was
“disappointed” policy makers didn’t cut the benchmark rate
after an April 30 meeting, even as he urged them to do so after
the baht appreciated to a 16-year high. Bank of Thailand
Chairman Virabongsa Ramangkura, who is not a rate-setting
committee member, said yesterday the currency’s advance has
affected exports and the economy.  “Speculation of an interest-rate reduction continues,
dragging swaps and bond yields down,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a
foreign-exchange trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in
Bangkok. “The central bank also seems to acknowledge the baht’s
appreciation has been too rapid.”  The one-year onshore swap rate, the fixed cost needed to
receive a floating payment, slumped 28 basis points, or 0.28
percentage point, from a week ago to 2.32 percent as of 9:26 a.m.
in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was
the biggest drop since the five-day period ended Sept. 23, 2011,
and the lowest level since February 2011.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due May 2015 fell nine
basis points this week to 2.75 percent, the lowest level since
November 2010. The rate was unchanged today.  Baht Losses  The baht headed for a second weekly loss, the longest
stretch since November, amid concern the central bank will
intervene and impose measures to slow inflows. The currency
depreciated 1.1 percent from a week ago and 0.4 percent today to
29.56 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  It has advanced 3.4 percent this year, the best performance
in  Asia , and touched 28.56 on April 22 and April 19, the
strongest level since July 1997.  “Investors and traders are growing sensitive to comments
and events with regard to the baht as speculation grew that the
central bank will do something to halt gains,” Sumitomo’s
Hasegawa said. “That makes it hard to buy the baht.” The
currency may trade in a range of 29.20 to 29.60 next week, he
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
