Claire’s Inc., the operator of jewelry
and accessories stores that’s controlled by  Apollo Global
Management LLC (APO) , filed to raise as much as $100 million in a U.S.
initial public offering.  The amount is a placeholder used to calculate fees and is
subject to change. Claire’s didn’t specify the number of shares
it plans to sell or the price range in a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filing today.  The specialty retailer operates in 41 countries, with more
than 2,700 company-operated stores in  North America , Europe and
China and 392 franchised stores.  New York-based Apollo took Claire’s private in 2007 for
$3.1 billion. Claire’s, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois,
plans to use proceeds from the offering to repay debt.  Claire’s sales rose 4.1 percent to $1.56 billion in the
year through Feb. 2, while net income plunged 60 percent to
$6.24 million.  The company will list its shares under the ticker CLRS on
the  New York  Stock Exchange, according to the filing. The
company didn’t name any underwriters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
