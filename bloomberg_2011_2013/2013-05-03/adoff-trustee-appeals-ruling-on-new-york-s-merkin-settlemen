The Bernard Madoff brokerage
liquidator appealed a federal judge’s ruling that blocked his
move to stop  New York  Attorney General Eric Schneiderman from
completing a $410 million settlement with J. Ezra Merkin.  The settlement will compensate Merkin investors whose money
was lost in the Ponzi scheme, according to a federal court
filing yesterday in Manhattan.  Madoff trustee  Irving Picard , who also has appealed rulings
barring him from collecting $30 billion from banks, seeks to
collect $500 million from Merkin for a different set of Madoff
investors. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan dismissed
what he called Picard’s entire effort to “derail” the accord,
saying he waited too long to assert his own claim as trustee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
