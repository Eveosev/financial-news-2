Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD) , the German pay-
television provider controlled by  Rupert Murdoch ’s  News Corp. (NWSA) ,
jumped the most in five months after posting an unexpected
operating profit in the first quarter.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization were 5.8 million euros ($7.6 million), after a 40.6
million-euro loss on that basis a year earlier, the Munich-based
company said today. Analysts on average projected an Ebitda loss
of 4.7 million euros, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Revenue rose 14 percent to 364 million euros, in line with
estimates, as the company increased user numbers 1.2 percent to
3.41 million from the end of the prior quarter and sold
additional services to subscribers. The shares  surged  as much as
12 percent to 5.04 euros, the biggest intraday gain since Nov.
21. They rose 7 percent at 10:15 a.m. Frankfurt time.  “Our subscriber growth is accelerating,” Chief Executive
Officer  Brian Sullivan  said on a conference call. “There’s no
reason to believe it will stop in the foreseeable future.”  Sky, whose shares have gained more than 150 percent over
the past twelve months, confirmed a forecast that it will post
its first positive Ebitda this year since News Corp. began
investing more than five years ago. Sullivan is trying to lure
clients with higher-capacity hard-drive recorders and content
that can be accessed via mobile devices.  “Sky is gaining momentum in the operative development and
building a solid track record,” Harald Heider, an analyst at DZ
Bank AG, said today in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
