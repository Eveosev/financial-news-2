(Corrects headline to say engineer arrested.)  Bangladesh police said they arrested
Abdur Razzaque Khan, an engineer who worked as a consultant to
Sohel Rana, the owner of the building that collapsed last month
and killed at least 487 in the nationâ€™s worst industrial
disaster.  Masudur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan
Police, confirmed the arrest, while declining to reveal the
reason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
