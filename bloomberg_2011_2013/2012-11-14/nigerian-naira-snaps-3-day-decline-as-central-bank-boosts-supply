Nigeria’s naira appreciated,
snapping three days of declines, after the central bank sold the
highest amount of the currency in eight weeks of auctions.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer gained less
than 0.1 percent to 157.805 a dollar by 1:55 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has strengthened 2.8 percent this
year, the second-best performer in Africa, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold $200 million at an auction
today, it said in an e-mailed statement. That brings its sale at
its two scheduled auctions this week to $350 million, the
highest in eight, according to data on its website. The
regulator sells dollars on Mondays and Wednesdays to keep the
naira within a 3 percent band around 155 a dollar.  “The central bank supply strengthened the naira, given
limited dollar demand at this time,” Edgar Ebinum, an analyst
at Lagos-based Cowry Asset Management Ltd., said by phone from
Lagos, the commercial capital.  The central bank, led by Governor Lamido Sanusi, has left
the benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record 12 percent
this year, increased lenders’ reserve requirements and limited
access to money auctions to stop dealers from buying foreign
currency using naira purchased from the bank at a discount.  The yield on the nation’s 16.39 percent naira debt due
January 2022 was unchanged at 12.74 percent, according to
yesterday’s prices compiled by the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association. Borrowing costs on the nation’s $500
million of Eurobonds due January 2021 declined 10 basis points
to 4.28 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi declined for the first day in three, sliding
0.1 percent to 1.8788 a dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
