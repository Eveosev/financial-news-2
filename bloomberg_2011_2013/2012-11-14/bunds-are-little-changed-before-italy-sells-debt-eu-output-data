Spanish bonds fell, with 10-year
yields rising toward the highest in six weeks, as European Union
Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn said the nation’s
steps to reduce its 2014 deficit are falling short.  Spanish securities led losses across the euro region after
Rehn told reporters in Brussels that only the nation had the
right to ask for a bailout from the  European Central Bank ,
suggesting a request for aid will be delayed. Italy’s government
securities erased gains after the nation sold 5 billion euros
($6.36 billion) of debt.  Germany ’s bunds were little changed as
it auctioned two-year notes at a negative yield for only the
second time.  “Spanish yields are moving upward,” said Morten Hassing Povlsen, a senior rates analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen.
“The Rehn comments suggest there’s no immediate decision made
on Spain. The market is still very sensitive to Spanish news and
the market is waiting for a request for aid.”  Spain’s 10-year yield rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 5.94 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
climbing to 5.96 percent yesterday, the  most  since Oct. 1. The
5.85 percent bond due in January 2022 dropped 0.595, or 5.95
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.38.  Aid Request  A real-estate bubble that hammered the nation’s banking
system has already forced  Spain  to tap 100 billion euros of aid
for its banks, and the government is deliberating whether to
call on  Europe ’s rescue fund to help shore up its own accounts.  Italy auctioned 3.5 billion euros of notes due in 2015 at
an average yield of 2.64 percent, a two-year low. The nation
also sold a total of 1.5 billion euros of 2023 and 2029 bonds,
the latter being the longest maturity offered this year.  Italy’s 10-year yield was little changed at 4.96 percent
after falling as much as five basis points.  Germany sold two-year notes with a negative yield, meaning
investors paid for the safety of owning German debt for the
second auction on record, and the first time since July.  The nation allotted 4.3 billion euros of securities
maturing in December 2014 at an average yield of minus 0.02
percent, down from 0.07 percent at an auction of similar-
maturity debt on Oct. 17, according to a statement from the
Bundesbank today.  German Auction  The German auction result underlines investors’
“nervousness and search for safety amid risks that persist from
 Greece ’s unresolved troubles and the impending fiscal cliff in
the U.S.,” finance agency spokesman Joerg Mueller said in an
interview after the auction.  The so-called fiscal cliff refers to a combined $607
billion of tax increases and spending cuts that will begin
automatically in January without a change to U.S. legislation.  Germany’s 10-year bund yielded 1.34 percent, with the two-
year rate at minus 0.022 percent.  Swedish bonds declined, with 10-year yields rising to the
most in a week, after demand fell as the nation auctioned
securities due in June 2022.  Sweden’s 10-year rate added two basis points to 1.42
percent after rising to 1.45 percent, the most since Nov. 7. The
nation sold 3.5 billion kronor of the 2022 debt at an average
yield of 1.44 percent.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by those of  Austria , according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  German bonds returned 4.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
securities gained 17 percent and Spain’s rose 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
