George Washington  University was
pulled from U.S. News & World Report’s ranking of top colleges
after the news magazine learned the college submitted false data
on its students’ academic achievements.  George Washington inflated the percentage of incoming
students in 2011 who graduated near the top of their high school
class, said Bob Morse, director of data research at  U.S. News 
who runs the rankings. The Washington-based school, which had
been ranked 51st nationwide, was moved to an “unranked”
category on the publication’s website.  George Washington is one of at least three colleges this
year found to have submitted incorrect data for U.S. News’s
rankings, along with Atlanta-based  Emory University  and
 Claremont McKenna College  near  Los Angeles . The rankings help
students  choose colleges  by rating the strength of institutions’
academic programs, according to the U.S. News website.  George Washington will remain unranked “until next fall’s
publication of the 2014 edition of the Best Colleges rankings,
and until George Washington confirms the accuracy of the
school’s next data submission in accordance with U.S. News’s
requirements,” Morse said in a statement on the website.  George Washington had reported that 78 percent of its
incoming 2011 students had grades that put them in the top 10
percent of their high school class, and 95 percent were in the
top quarter, Morse said. In fact, 58 percent of the students
were in the top 10th of their class, and 90 percent in the top
quarter, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
