Natixis (KN)  SA, the investment-banking
unit of  France ’s second-largest lender by branches, said third-
quarter profit fell 59 percent as a charge related to its own
debt outweighed a rebound in trading revenue.  Net income fell to 142 million euros ($181 million) from
344 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based bank said in
an e-mailed statement today. That missed the 154 million-euro
average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Natixis and its parent, Groupe BPCE, entered  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis with smaller risks compared with French
rivals. Credit Agricole SA, France’s third-largest bank by
market value, last week posted a 2.85 billion-euro quarterly
loss tied to the sale of its Greek unit Emporiki Bank.  Natixis booked a 181 million-euro pretax accounting charge
stemming from the theoretical cost of buying back its own debt
as market prices fluctuate. So-called credit valuation
adjustments require banks to book losses when the value of their
debt rises, and gains when it declines, on the theory that a
loss, or profit, would be realized were the bank to repurchase
that debt.  Revenue from Natixis’s capital-markets business more than
doubled to 329 million euros as the interest-rate, foreign
exchange, commodities and treasury activities “turned in
satisfactory performances,” the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
