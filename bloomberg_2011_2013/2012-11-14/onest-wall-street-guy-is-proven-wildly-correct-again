Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. (OSG) , the New York-based tanker-fleet operator that was the subject of my  column  last week,  filed  for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection today. In hindsight, it was a perfect short for anyone paying attention to the company's securities filings. On Oct. 3, Overseas Shipholding  disclosed  that a member of its board and audit committee, G. Allen Andreas III, had resigned, citing a disagreement with the company over its handling of a tax issue. Andreas, a former vice president at the Wall Street investment bank Allen & Co, is a 43-year-old  money manager  in New York at Galaco Capital, which oversees his family's holdings. Less than three weeks later, on Oct. 22, the company  said  investors should no longer rely on its financial statements since 2009, citing the same tax issue Andreas had cautioned about in his  resignation letter . The company also said it might file for Chapter 11. Overseas Shipholding's stock closed at $7.08 on Oct. 2, the day before Andreas's resignation letter was made public. It fell to $6.82 on Oct. 3. Yesterday, the shares closed at $1.13. Today, the  New York  Stock Exchange  suspended  trading in the stock and began delisting proceedings. At least Andreas gave investors some advance warning.
