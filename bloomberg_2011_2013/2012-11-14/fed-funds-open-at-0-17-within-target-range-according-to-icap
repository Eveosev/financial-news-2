Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the Federal
Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.28 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.16 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will sell Treasuries maturing from May
2015 to June 2015. The sales are part of the Fed’s program to
replace short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term
Treasuries in an effort to keep borrowing costs low.  The central bank plans to sell from $7 billion to $8
billion of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
