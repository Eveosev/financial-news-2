The chief operating officer of  Green
Infra Ltd. , an Indian wind-farm developer backed by IDFC Private
Equity, has left the company amid a slowdown in the industry
after government incentives expired.  Sunil Jain is leaving the New Delhi-based company after
four years, he said in an e-mail without providing a reason. He
plans to remain in  India ’s renewable energy industry, he said.  Investment in Indian wind projects plunged 39 percent in
the first three quarters compared with the previous year after a
tax benefit and government subsidy expired on March 31,
Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in a Nov. 5 statement. The
world’s third-biggest wind market after  China  and the U.S. may
struggle to install 2,000 megawatts this financial year,
compared with more than 3,000 megawatts before, if the
incentives aren’t restored, according to the London-based
researcher.  Green Infra, which bought  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Indian wind-energy
portfolio of 100 megawatts in 2009, has 232 megawatts of wind
farms and a 10-megawatt solar plant in the country, Jain said in
an August interview. IDFC Private Equity, which manages $1.3
billion in funds for Indian infrastructure investments, set up
Green Infra in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
