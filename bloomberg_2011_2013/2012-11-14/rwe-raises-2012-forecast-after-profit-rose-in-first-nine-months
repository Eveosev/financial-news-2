RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-largest
utility, increased a full-year profit forecast after earnings
rose on an improved performance from its trading business.  Operating results for 2012 may exceed the 5.81 billion
euros ($7.39 billion) reported in 2011, the Essen-based company
said today in a statement. The company had previously expected
to match last year’s level.  The increased forecast comes after EON AG abandoned its
2013 targets, sending its shares down by a record yesterday.
RWE, which didn’t give guidance for next year, and EON are
cutting costs and selling assets after  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
ordered the permanent halt of all nuclear reactors by 2022
following  Japan ’s Fukushima disaster.  “The quality of the raised outlook shouldn’t be
overestimated given that improved, but naturally volatile,
trading results primarily triggered the upgrade,”  Michael Schaefer , an analyst at Equinet AG in Frankfurt, said in a note
to clients.  RWE’s forecast for recurrent net income, which is adjusted
for exceptional items and is used to calculate the dividend, was
left unchanged and is expected to match last year’s 2.48 billion
euros.  In Line  Recurrent net income climbed 6.2 percent to 1.89 billion
euros in the first nine months of 2012 from a year earlier,
according to a statement statement. That was in line with the
1.88 billion-euro average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales advanced 0.5 percent to 38.4 billion euros.  In the statement, RWE said it benefited from “operational
improvements, particularly in its trading business.”  Recurrent net income almost doubled to 227 million euros in
the third quarter. The number was calculated by subtracting
half-year earnings from nine-month results. Third-quarter sales
increased 5.2 percent to 11.3 billion euros.  RWE’s operating result was up 7.9 percent to 4.61 billion
euros, net income increased 33 percent to 1.88 billion euros,
while earnings per share rose 15 percent to 3.06 euros per
share.  Net debt increased 14 percent to 34.2 billion euros as of
Sept. 30.  “Net debt remains high and will be higher than the 2011
level by the end of the year,” said Daniel Seidenspinner, an
analyst at B. Metzler Seel Sohn & Co. KGaA in  Frankfurt .
“That’s too high a ratio because RWE has made little progress
with its disposal program and is still a long way off” the
targeted 7 billion euros, he said.  EON said Nov. 12 its 2013 profit forecast is no longer
achievable, citing “substantial economic risks and the
structural changes of the industry.” The stock plunged the most
since the company was formed in June 2000, even after EON said
underlying net income more than doubled in the first nine months
of the year.  RWE rose as much as 3.5 percent before paring gains to
trade little changed at 33.05 euros as of 10:50 a.m. in
Frankfurt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
