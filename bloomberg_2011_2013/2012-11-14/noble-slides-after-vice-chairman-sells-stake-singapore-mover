Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL)  slipped to a three-
month low in  Singapore  trading after Vice Chairman Emeritus
Harindarpal Singh Banga sold a 3.5 percent stake in the
commodity supplier that reported lower-than-expected earnings
last week.  Noble fell 7.3 percent after Banga offered 225 million
shares for sale at a discount of as much as 5.6 percent to
Noble’s previous close. Excluding the stake, 131 million shares
changed hands today, compared with average daily volume of 45.5
million in the past year.  “It’s not a good sign when a director sells,” said Mervin
Song, an analyst at DBS Vickers Securities (Singapore) Pte. in
Singapore. “He would know more than most people.”  Stephen Brown , spokesman for Hong Kong-based Noble, said
the company wouldn’t comment on Banga’s private sale. Banga
wasn’t immediately available when a call was made to his office.  Noble, Asia’s biggest publicly listed commodity trader,
reported third-quarter  profit  of $75.2 million on Nov. 8,
missing the $154.6 million mean estimate of seven analysts.
Earnings at Noble’s three units - agriculture, energy and metals
- fell short of their expectations, Macquarie Capital Securities
(Singapore) Pte. said that day in a report.  The stock dropped to S$1.08, the lowest since Aug. 3. The
benchmark  Straits Times  index declined 0.9 percent.  A block trade of 225 million shares crossed at 8:31 a.m. in
Singapore at S$1.10 apiece after Banga offered to sell the stake
at S$1.10 to S$1.12 each, according to a term sheet obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  Banga, who sold 115 million shares in March, owned 372.5
million shares, or about 5.7 percent of Noble, before the latest
sale, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Banga offered his shares through Lexdale International,
which is controlled by Banga and his spouse, according to the
company’s annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
