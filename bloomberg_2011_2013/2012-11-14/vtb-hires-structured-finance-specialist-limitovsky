VTB Group,  Russia ’s second-biggest
bank, hired Konstantin Limitovsky, a specialist in structured
and project finance.  Limitovsky joined this month as vice president, a Moscow-
based official for VTB said yesterday by telephone. He declined
to comment on his role. Limitovsky could not immediately be
reached by phone.  VTB is among Russian banks where non-performing loans are
hurting profit. OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, had
employed Limitovsky to lead a team restructuring its real estate
loan portfolio until he left in 2010 to set up his own advisory
firm.  Limitovsky has also headed structured and project finance
at Russia’s OAO Gazprombank and worked at Moscow-based  Alfa Bank 
in a similar role.  VTB’s net income in the second quarter tumbled 63 percent
to 10.1 billion rubles ($320 million) after provisions for bad
loans surged. The bank’s market value has more than halved since
an initial public offering in 2007, partly on concern that
customer defaults on mortgages and other debt increased.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
