Former Central Intelligence Agency
Director David Petraeus is willing to appear before the Senate
Intelligence Committee, panel chairwoman Senator  Dianne Feinstein  told reporters today.  Feinstein said yesterday her committee wants to talk with
Petraeus about circumstances surrounding the attack in Benghazi,
Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other
Americans. Petraeus recently returned from Libya.  “General Petraeus is willing to come before the committee,
and the details of that are being worked out,” Feinstein, a
California Democrat, told reporters today.  “I don’t know when General Petraeus is coming at this
stage,” Feinstein said. “We have an agenda for tomorrow.”  Senator  Saxby Chambliss , a Georgia Republican, said
yesterday he also expects Petraeus to appear soon before the
panel. He said he also thinks the committee will probe
allegations of the affair that led to Petraeus’s resignation
Nov. 9, after the  Federal Bureau  of Investigation finishes its
work.  “At some point, I’m sure we will,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
