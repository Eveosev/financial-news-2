The  International Energy Agency 
plans to publish an annual report on  energy efficiency , starting
next year, to bolster its efforts to promote fuel saving
technologies in businesses, buildings and houses.  The IEA publishes a report each month on supply and demand
in the oil market, and annual studies on other markets.  “From next year onwards, we plan an annual market report
on energy efficiency,” Maria van der Hoeven, executive director
of the IEA, said at a press conference in Dubai today. “So that
will be the fifth one, adding to the reports we have on oil,
gas, coal and renewables.”  Adopting measures to promote energy efficiency can buy the
world an additional five years to seal a climate-protection deal
and would amount to a low-cost “hidden fuel,” the IEA said in
a Nov. 12 report. Increased energy-saving measures could cut
worldwide oil demand by almost 13 million barrels a day by 2035,
or the current combined output of Russia and  Norway .  For now, the agency has “no plans for a monthly gas
report,” Van der Hoeven said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
