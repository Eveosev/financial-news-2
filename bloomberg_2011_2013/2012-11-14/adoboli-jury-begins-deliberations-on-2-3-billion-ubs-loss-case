The jury in the trial of Kweku Adoboli, the former  UBS AG (UBSN)  trader accused of causing the largest
unauthorized trading loss in British history, began
deliberations on whether or not he is guilty.  The 11-person jury was sent out at 2:30 p.m. London time
today to consider two counts of fraud and four false accounting
charges. He has been on trial since Sept. 14, one year after he
confessed in an e-mail to a UBS accountant to booking fake
hedges to hide the risk of his actions. The trades led to a $2.3
billion loss.  Adoboli testified before the London criminal court that his
managers pressured him to take on more risk and overlooked the
fact that the profits the desk was generating didnâ€™t match up to
its reported risk profile. He said nothing he did was dishonest
and it was all intended to make money for the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
