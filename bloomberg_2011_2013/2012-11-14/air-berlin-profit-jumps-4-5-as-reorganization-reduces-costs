Air Berlin Plc (AB1)  said quarterly profit
rose 4.5 percent, trailing analysts’ estimates, even as a
reorganization helped reduce spending at Europe’s third-largest
discount airline.  Third-quarter earnings before interest and taxes climbed to
101.2 million euros ($129.1 million) from 96.8 million euros a
year earlier, the carrier said in a statement today. That missed
the 116.8 million-euro average of five  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue rose 1.4 percent to 1.4 billion euros.  “We are on the right track, but the journey is far from
over,” Chief Executive Officer Hartmut Mehdorn said in the
statement. “Our goal remains a return to profit next year.”  Air Berlin, 29 percent owned by  Etihad Airways  of  Abu
Dhabi , announced a second savings program last month to ensure
it achieves a “positive result” in 2013. While a project set
up last year to cut annual costs by 250 million euros exceeded
targets,  Europe ’s worsening economy required additional
measures, according to the Berlin-based carrier, which said
earlier today it will specify goals for the program in coming
weeks.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG,  Germany ’s biggest airline, has also
undertaken an efficiency-improvement plan to save 1.5 billion
euros annually by 2015. The Cologne-based company is eliminating
as many as 4,500 jobs and moving all short-haul operations
outside its Frankfurt and Munich hubs into the Germanwings low-
cost brand.  Air Berlin dropped routes and reduced flights as part of
the earlier cutbacks, scaling back seating by 2.2 percent, and
closed airport bases in the German cities of Erfurt and
Dortmund. Passenger numbers in October fell 5 percent to 3.18
million travelers, while the  load factor , or proportion of seats
filled, increased 1.3 percentage points to 81 percent, Air
Berlin said Nov. 6.  This year’s target is for an annual loss before interest
and taxes narrower than 87 million euros, Air Berlin said in
August. While the airline said then that it anticipated
“significant” profit in 2013, the company reiterated today
that further efficiency measures are needed to ensure a 2013
profit. The existing cost-saving program will add 230 million
euros to operating profit this year, Air Berlin said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
