The leu weakened for a sixth day,
its longest losing streak in more than four months, before
 Romania  goes to polls on Dec. 9.  The leu depreciated 0.1 percent to 4.5452 per euro by 5
p.m. in Bucharest, the lowest level since Oct. 29. Yields on
2019 Eurobonds fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to 4.86 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A campaign for the general elections started on Nov. 9 as
the ruling coalition of Prime Minister Victor Ponta goes head-
to-head with the opposition party supporting president Traian Basescu. The European Union cut Romania’s economic growth
forecast to 0.8 percent this year on Nov. 7 from a previous
estimate of 1.4 percent. The statistics institute will release
data on third-quarter gross domestic product tomorrow.  The expectations of a weakening economy and “the upcoming
elections argue for a weaker leu, but we believe it is likely to
lose ground only slowly, given that the central bank’s actions
to prop up the currency and also fears of these actions are set
to persist,” Ana-Maria Morarescu, a Bucharest-based economist
at Raiffeisen Bank Romania SA wrote in a note.  The central bank, which has a managed-float currency
policy, increased a funding cap to 6 billion lei ($1.7 billion)
in a weekly repo sale on Nov. 12, compared with 4 billion lei on
Nov. 5 and Oct. 29. It last offered 6 billion lei on Oct. 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
