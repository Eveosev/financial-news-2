South African  retail sales  growth
eased more than forecast in September as  consumer confidence 
waned because of slowing economic expansion.  Retail sales rose 4.3 percent from a year earlier, below
the revised 6.7 percent pace in August, Pretoria-based
Statistics  South Africa  said on its website today. The  median
estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of 12 economists was for growth
of 4.8 percent. Sales fell 0.5 percent from a month earlier.  “Confidence is definitely playing a role, it is a slowdown
from unsustainable growth,” Elna Moolman, an economist at
 Renaissance Capital  in Johannesburg, said by telephone. “This
trend will continue.”  The  Reserve Bank  will probably hold borrowing costs at the
lowest level in at least 30 years at its meeting Nov. 22 as
economic growth deteriorates because of strikes and slumping
demand for manufactured exports, according to the median
estimate of 12 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Consumer spending , which makes up about two-thirds of
expenditure in the economy, is under pressure as the FNB/BER
confidence index remains near a four-year low in the third
quarter. The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s
 business confidence index , at 92 in October, remained close to a
12-year low reached in July.  The rand extended its decline after the data was released.
The currency dropped 0.4 percent to 8.8333 per dollar at 1:16
p.m. in Johannesburg. The yield on the rand debt due in 2015
dropped 2 basis points to 5.47 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
