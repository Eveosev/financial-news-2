European Union carbon permits for
December fell below 8 euros a metric ton for the first time in
nine days after the European Union published a report on long-
term improvements to its carbon market.  The benchmark contract declined as much as 5 percent to
7.98 euros a ton on Londonâ€™s ICE Futures Europe exchange, and
was at 8.03 euros at 11:56 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
