Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
halted a seven-day losing streak, closing little changed, as a
measure of volatility on the benchmark fell to its lowest since
February 2011. Energy companies dropped on lower oil prices.  Sharp Corp. surged 7.2 percent to lead advancing shares on
the Nikkei 225 after Kyodo News reported  Intel Corp . may invest
up to 40 billion yen ($503 million) in the TV maker. Consumer
lender Aiful Corp. soared 30 percent after posting profits that
beat estimates. Refiners Cosmo Oil Co. and  JX Holdings Inc. (5020)  lost
at least 1.7 percent.  The Nikkei 225 added less than 0.1 percent to close at
8,664.73 in Tokyo. The gauge moved within a 26.91 yen range, the
narrowest since Feb. 8 2011. The  Nikkei Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell
for a third day, dropping 2.7 percent to 16.71, a level implying
the smallest price swings in 21 months. The  Topix (TPX)  Index was
little changed at 722.41.  “The negatives right now aren’t powerful enough to push
investors to keep selling, but they’re just enough to stop
investors from buying,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , a senior fund
manager at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, which oversees
$6.6 billion.  The Nikkei 225 lost more than 4 percent in a seven-day
slide through yesterday that was the longest since April. Volume
on the gauge today was a third below the 30-day intraday
average.  Shares on the Topix traded at 0.9 times book value,
compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5
for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means
companies trades for less than what their assets might be worth.  Fiscal Cliff  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  added 0.4 percent today. The
gauge dropped 0.4 percent yesterday as concern about the  federal
budget  debate erased a rally led by Home Depot Inc.  President  Barack Obama  meets Democratic and Republican
leaders in Congress this week to begin talks on a plan to avert
the so-called fiscal cliff. Unless a compromise is reached to
cut the debt, $607 billion in automatic tax increases and
spending cuts will come into effect started in January.  Energy companies fell after crude oil for December delivery
declined 0.2 percent to $$85.38 a barrel in New York yesterday,
the lowest close since Nov. 8. Cosmo Oil lost 2 percent to 146
yen. JX Holdings slumped 1.7 percent 412 yen.  Aiful gained the  most  in the Topix, rising 30 percent to
312 yen. The consumer lender posted a 76 percent jump in first-
half net income to 19.6 billion yen, beating its forecast by 35
percent, on cost cuts.  Sharp, Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays,
jumped 7.2 percent to 163 yen after  Kyodo News  said the company
is in final talks to sell a stake to Intel Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
