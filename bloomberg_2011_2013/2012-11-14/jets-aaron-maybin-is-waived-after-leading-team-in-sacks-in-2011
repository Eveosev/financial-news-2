The  New York Jets  waived linebacker
Aaron Maybin, who failed to record a quarterback sack in eight
games after recording a team-leading six last season.  Maybin was a 2009 first-round draft pick who was signed by
the Jets last year after failing to record a sack in his first
two National Football League seasons with the  Buffalo Bills .  He turned his career around in 2011, when he was used as a
pass-rushing specialist, and talked during the preseason of
expanding his role to being an every-down player.  Maybin, however, recorded one tackle in 119 defensive snaps,
according to ESPN, for a Jets defense that has allowed the
fourth-most rushing yards in the NFL during a 3-6 start.  The Jets also placed defensive back Isaiah Trufant on
injured reserve with a left knee injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
