Nigeria has appointed Stanbic IBTC
Stockbrokers Ltd., a unit of  Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) , to act as
government stockbroker, the Debt Management Office said.  The broker is expected to start work within a week and will
provide prices for FGN bonds and securities on the  Nigerian
Stock Exchange  for investors, Patience Oniha,  executive director 
in charge of market development at the Abuja-based DMO, said in
a phone interview from the capital.  Africa’s biggest oil producer plans to sell 240 billion
naira ($1.5 billion) of five-, seven- and 10-year bonds this
quarter, the DMO said on Sept. 25. The agency recommends maximum
borrowing in 2013 of $4.35 billion externally and 340.7 billion
naira domestically, it said in a report yesterday.  The appointment of the broker will enable retail investors
to access FGN bonds and to be able to exit before maturity,
Oniha said.  The yield on the nation’s 16.39 percent naira debt due
January 2022 was unchanged at 12.74 percent, according to
yesterday’s prices compiled by the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
