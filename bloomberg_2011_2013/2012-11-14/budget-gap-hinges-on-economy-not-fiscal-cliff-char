Sustaining U.S. economic growth may
narrow the federal government’s budget deficit more than raising
taxes or reducing outlays, according to James W. Paulsen, Wells
Capital Management Inc.’s chief investment strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks deficits and surpluses as a
percentage of nominal gross domestic product, unadjusted for
inflation, since 1969. Paulsen included a similar chart in a
report two days ago.  Deficits totaled 6.9 percent of nominal GDP for the 12
months ended in September, according to data compiled by the
Treasury. The gap narrowed from 10.4 percent in December 2009,
six months after the latest recession ended, even as President
 Barack Obama  and a Republican-led  House of Representatives 
sparred over fiscal policy.  “We’ve had gridlock throughout this recovery and yet the
deficit’s been improving all on its own,” Paulsen said during a
Bloomberg Radio interview yesterday. At the current pace, the
budget gap is poised to fall below 5 percent of nominal GDP in
two years, according to the Minneapolis-based strategist.  Any “grand bargain” by the White House and Congress on
the so-called fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts
runs the risk of cutting off economic growth, which is mainly
responsible for the shrinking deficit, he said.  Nominal GDP has expanded at a 3.8 percent to 4.5 percent
pace since the second quarter of 2010, based on year-over-year
changes. Last quarter’s growth amounted to 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
