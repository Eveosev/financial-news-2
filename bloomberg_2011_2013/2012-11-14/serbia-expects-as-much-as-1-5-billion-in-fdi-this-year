Serbian foreign direct investments
will decline by at least a third this year as  Europe ’s debt
crisis affects investor confidence and other Balkan nations vie
for what little opportunities are available.  Serbia sees foreign investments reaching 1 billion euros
($1.27 billion) to 1.2 billion euros by the end of the year,
compared with 1.83 billion euros last year, said Bojan Jankovic,
the deputy director of the  Serbian Investment and Export
Promotion Agency . FDI was at around 600 million euros over the
first six months, he said.  Key investors from the European Union “have become much
more reluctant” to commit in the region, even as some Balkan
nations increase incentives for them, Jankovic said at an
investment forum in Belgrade today.  Serbia’s subsidy of 4,000 euros to 10,000 euros for every
job created has been topped by some of the competing countries,
he said. The size of foreign investments next year may remain at
the 2012 level, excluding possible large asset sales by the
state that may offer Telekom Srbija AD, the national phone
company, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
