Crude erased gains after rising for
the first time in three days after a report showed U.S. retail
sales declined in October for the first time in four months.  Futures rose as much as 0.7 percent before retreating.
Retail sales in the U.S. fell in October for the first time in
four months, influenced by the effects of superstorm Sandy.
The 0.3 percent drop followed a 1.3 percent increase in
September that was larger than previously reported, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . U.S.  inventories 
probably climbed last week to the highest in more than three
months, according to a Bloomberg survey before a government
report tomorrow. U.S. equity futures rose.  Crude for December delivery climbed to a high of $86 a
barrel before falling and was at $85.15 a barrel, down 23 cents,
in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
8:50 a.m. local time. The contract declined 19 cents to $85.38
yesterday, the lowest close since Nov. 8. Prices have lost 14
percent this year.  Brent oil for December settlement, which expires tomorrow,
was 11 cents lower at $108.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The more actively traded January
contract lost 18 cents to $107.16. The European benchmark crude
was at a  premium  of $23 to  New York  futures. The spread narrowed
yesterday for the first time in three days to $22.88.  To contact the reporter on this story:
