THQ Inc. (THQI) , the money-losing video-
game maker, said it’s working with  Wells Fargo & Co . to resolve
a technical default on its $50 million credit facility.  Wells Fargo, after reviewing THQ’s receivables and
inventories, informed the maker of “Saints Row” games on Oct.
16 that it had borrowed too much under terms of the loan, the
Agoura Hills, California-based company said yesterday in a
 regulatory filing .  The company repaid $5.6 million of the $21 million it had
borrowed to stay in compliance, according to the filing, and
three weeks later, on Nov. 7, Wells Fargo told THQ it had
defaulted on the credit facility after borrowing too much on one
or more occasions.  “We believe we will reach an agreement on this matter with
Wells Fargo,” THQ President Jason Rubin said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement.  THQ said on Nov. 6 it hired the investment bank Centerview
Partners LLC to help evaluate its options after the delay of
three titles put a strain on its finances. The developer missed
a shift to mobile devices and away from consoles, and burned
cash with uDraw, a game tablet that failed to catch on last
year, losing as much as $100 million, according to Brean Murray
analysts.  THQ fell 6.4 percent to $1.11 at the close in  New York . The
stock has  retreated  85 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
