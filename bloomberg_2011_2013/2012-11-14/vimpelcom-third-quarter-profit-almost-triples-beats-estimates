VimpelCom Ltd (VIP) , the mobile operator
owned by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman and  Norway ’s
 Telenor ASA (TEL) , reported third-quarter profit that beat analyst
estimates and said it was close to a decision on dividends.  Net income rose to $538 million from $189 million a year
earlier, when foreign-exchange losses hurt earnings, Amsterdam-
based VimpelCom said in a statement today. Profit exceeded the
average estimate of $509 million from 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales fell 6 percent to $5.7 billion.  The third-quarter results “are unlikely to have a major
impact on the stock price as the market is currently more
concerned” with the resolution of the conflict between
Fridman’s telecoms group Altimo and Telenor and the possibility
of VimpelCom resuming dividend payments, Evgeny Golosnoy, an
analyst at IFC Metropol, said in a note on Nov. 9.  VimpelCom’s supervisory board may make a decision on
dividend payments for 2011 and 2012 as early as this quarter,
Chief Executive Officer Jo Lunder said in a telephone interview.  “I would recommend the board doing so once the FAS claim
goes away,” Lunder said, referring to an unresolved court
injunction by the Russian antitrust watchdog. VimpelCom has a
policy to pay at least 80 cents  per share , he said.  Given the low free float of shares, U.S.-traded VimpelCom
has put on hold a plan to obtain a technical listing on a
European bourse, Lunder said. Vimpelcom’s shares have gained 13
percent in the year to date, compared with an 11 percent drop
for the Bloomberg Europe Telecommunication Services Index.  Increased Stake  Fornebu, Norway-based Telenor and Altimo have been fighting
for control over VimpelCom for several years. In April,  Russia ’s
Federal Anti-Monopoly Service claimed Telenor had no right to
increase its stake in VimpelCom, which it said owns strategic
assets in Russia, to a level exceeding local shareholders’
ownership. The agency also won an injunction banning VimpelCom’s
Russian unit from making payouts to the parent.  Altimo last month increased its stake in VimpelCom to 47.9
percent of voting shares, exceeding Telenor’s 43 percent. The
Moscow court is set to hear the antitrust watchdog’s claim on
Nov. 27, according to VimpelCom and the watchdog also known as
FAS. VimpelCom convened a shareholder meeting for Dec. 21 to re-
elect the board.  VimpelCom’s charter requires a shareholder whose ownership
passes a threshold of 50 percent to make a mandatory offer to
all other shareholders, Lunder said in the interview today.
Telenor would be “pragmatic” over any offer from Altimo, the
CEO of the Norwegian company Jon Fredrik Baksaas told the
Financial Times on Nov. 1.  Uzbekistan Gain  VimpelCom, which operates in Russia,  Italy ,  Africa  and
Asia, increased subscribers by 7 percent from a year earlier to
212 million. The company gained about 2.2 million users in the
third quarter in Uzbekistan, where competitor  OAO Mobile
TeleSystems (MBT)  shut its services in July after a court order,  AC&M
Consulting  said last week.  VimpelCom is seeking to increase profitability by expanding
data services and cutting costs as it tries to reduce its $26.6
billion debt after  acquiring  telecommunication assets from
Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris last year. That deal more
than doubled the company’s subscribers and made it the sixth-
largest operator globally.  The margin of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization to sales rose to 44 percent from 42.2 percent a
year earlier, VimpelCom said today. The growth was led by Russia
and former Soviet republics. Performance in Algeria, Bangladesh
and  Pakistan  was undermined by local currencies depreciation
versus the dollar.  Examining Portfolio  VimpelCom, which operates in 18 countries, is weighing the
sale of small or unprofitable units in Cambodia,  Laos  and Sub-
Saharan Africa including Burundi, Central African Republic and
 Zimbabwe , the Financial Times reported last month, citing a
person familiar with the matter.  The company is continuing to examine its assets portfolio,
while it has no plans to quit any particular region, Lunder
said. VimpelCom is weighing both divesting and market
consolidation opportunities in different markets, the CEO said,
declining to be more specific.  VimpelCom is seeking a “mutually beneficial” solution
with the Algerian government over the future of local unit
Djezzy, according to Lunder. Algeria wants operational control
of the company, while VimpelCom wants the profitable operator to
remain on its balance sheet.  To contact the reporters on this story:
