Canada’s Competition Bureau said
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  isn’t cooperating with an
investigation into alleged interest-rate fixing.  The bureau has been probing the conduct of at least seven
firms, including RBS, into allegations they manipulated the Yen
London interbank offered rate.  Suggestions by RBS in a recent quarterly statement that the
bank is cooperating fully with the probe are “false,” the
competition watchdog said today in a news release.  RBS hasn’t applied for immunity or leniency, and challenged
a production order sought by the bureau seeking documents from
the bank, said the bureau, which regulates antitrust matters.  A spokesman for the Edinburgh-based bank said it’s “simply
not accurate” to say RBS doesn’t want to cooperate with the
competition bureau.  “We have told the bureau that we want to provide the
documents they are requesting, but that the mechanism they have
chosen requires RBS to break laws in the U.K.,” spokesman  Ed Canaday  said in an e-mail.  Canaday said the bureau has refused offers to overcome the
issue through a “number of alternative mechanisms.” RBS
remains committed to cooperating fully with the bureau, he said.  RBS obtained an interim stay in February on a court order
compelling it to turn over records to the bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
