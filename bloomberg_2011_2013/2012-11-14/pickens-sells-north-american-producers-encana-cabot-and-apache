Billionaire investor  T. Boone Pickens  cut his energy equity fund’s holdings, selling North
American oil and gas producers including Encana Corp.,  Cabot Oil
& Gas Corp. (COG)  and  Apache Corp. (APA)  during the third quarter.  Pickens’s Dallas-based BP Capital Management LP sold
341,380 shares of Encana valued at $7.1 million, 165,902 shares
of Cabot valued at $6.5 million and 42,216 shares of Apache
valued at $3.7 million in the three months ended Sept. 30,
according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  The fund sold off holdings in seven other energy companies
including  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  and power producers  NRG
Energy Inc. (NRG)  and  Calpine Corp. (CPN)   Natural gas producers’ earnings and cash flow have been
trimmed by a plunge in prices as gas futures traded in New York
touched a 10-year low in April amid a glut of the fuel. The
prices have since risen, and climbed to a one-year high today as
colder weather approached parts of the U.S.  The value of Pickens’s equity holdings fell 24 percent to
$98.8 million as of Sept. 30, from $130.7 million at the end of
the second quarter, according to the filing.  In the latest quarter, Pickens’ fund bought coal producers
including 237,700 shares of  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI)  valued at $1.5
million and 48,075 shares of  Consol Energy Inc. (CNX)  valued at $1.4
million. BP Capital also took a $5.1 million stake in oil field
services provider  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , purchasing 152,334 shares.  Pickens sold down stakes in Transocean Ltd.,  McMoRan
Exploration Co. (MMR)  and  National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV)  His fund
increased stakes in  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ,  Sandridge Energy Inc. (SD) ,
 Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN)  and  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)   Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F with the SEC within 45 days of
each quarter’s end to show their U.S.-listed stocks, options and
convertible bonds. The filings don’t show non-U.S. securities or
how much cash the firms hold.  To contact the reporters on this story:
