Torii Hunter agreed on a two-year
free-agent contract with the  Detroit Tigers  worth $26 million,
according to USA Today.  Hunter, a 37-year-old outfielder who played the last five
Major League Baseball seasons for the Los Angeles Angels,
spurned offers from seven other franchises,  USA Today said ,
citing an unnamed official with knowledge of the negotiations
who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal wasnâ€™t
finished.  Hunter, a career .277 hitter, batted .313 with 16 home runs
and 92 runs batted in last season for the Angels, who went 89-73
and missed the playoffs. A four-time All-Star, most recently in
2010, Hunter has 297 career homers and 1,143 RBI. He played for
the  Minnesota Twins  from 1997 to 2007, and won a Gold Glove for
his defensive play every year from 2001 to 2009.  The Tigers were 88-74 last season, reaching the  World
Series  before being swept in four games by the San Francisco
Giants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
