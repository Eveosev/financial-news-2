The City Council in Atwater,
 California , an agricultural community facing insolvency,
suspended discussion of entering bankruptcy after winning
concessions from unions that will pare labor costs.  The council voted 5-0 yesterday to stop considering a
proposal to invoke a state law requiring mediation with
creditors or a declaration of a fiscal emergency. The steps are
prerequisites for seeking court protection. It also agreed to
ask voters to pass a local sales-tax increase of 0.5 percentage
point in March.  “This is a key part of our getting back to fiscal
stability,” Mayor Joan Faul said of the proposed tax increase.  The community of 28,000, nestled among  dairies and almond 
groves about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southeast of San
Francisco, began its fiscal year facing a $3 million budget
deficit. Across California, foreclosures and fallout from the
longest recession since the 1930s have depleted property-tax
revenue while municipalities are burdened with rising costs.  Under agreements with police and other city workers,
Atwater will reduce pay for some by 5 percent and will cut jobs.
Three California communities, Stockton, San Bernardino and
Mammoth Lakes, have all entered Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings
since June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
