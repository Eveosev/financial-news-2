Net borrowing  by Spanish banks from
the European Central Bank fell in October for a second month as
funding conditions for lenders eased.  Net average ECB borrowing  dropped  9.7 percent from
September to 341.6 billion euros ($435.6 billion), the Bank of
Spain said on its website today. Gross borrowing was 366.9
billion euros in October, down from 399.9 billion euros.  The pledge in July by ECB President Mario Draghi to do
“whatever it takes” to defend the euro and his offer to buy
government bonds should Spain request it has helped ease
financing conditions for the country’s banks.  The yield on Spanish 10-year debt has dropped to 5.8
percent from as high as 7.6 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
