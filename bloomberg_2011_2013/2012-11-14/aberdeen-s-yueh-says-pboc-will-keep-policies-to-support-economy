Ee Leen Yueh, a Singapore-based
fixed-income manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, comments
on People’s Bank of  China  Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan ’s exit from
the Communist Party’s central committee.  “It’s not news that he’ll retire next year. The precedent
I’ve observed with major central banks is when new leaders come
on board they tend to bring in new ways of decision-making.  ‘‘I don’t expect major changes to PBOC’s policy stance to
support monetary and economic stability for the first six months
or so, especially at this point in time when macro conditions
are not that stable externally or internally.  ‘‘During his tenure, Zhou Xiaochuan brought about a fair
bit of changes and pushed through a more technocrat style of
decision-making.  ‘‘However, in terms of the structure in decision-making,
the power still very much lies with the State Council given how
important monetary policy is and how much that’s tied to central
policy in China. I don’t foresee any changes to that centralized
structure even with a new leader on board.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
