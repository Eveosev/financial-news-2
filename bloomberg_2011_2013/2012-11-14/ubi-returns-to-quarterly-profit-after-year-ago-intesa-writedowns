Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA ,
 Italy ’s fifth-largest bank, returned to a quarterly profit after
year-earlier writedowns on its stake in  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) 
weren’t repeated.  Net income  was 63.2 million euros ($80 million) in the
third quarter after a loss of 69 million euros a year earlier,
when the Bergamo, Italy-based lender wrote down its stake in
Intesa by 109 million euros. Earnings beat the 42.9 million-euro
average estimate of 9 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Victor Massiah is cutting 1,600
jobs and selling assets to strengthen finances and increase
profitability as Italy’s third recession in a decade forces
banks to boost provisions against rising bad loans. UBI said it
expects “sharply lower” recurring operating costs this year.  Loan-loss provisions increased to 160.3 million euros in
the third quarter from 135.1 million euros a year earlier. UBI’s
core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, was
at 10.49 percent at the end of September, up from 10.24 percent
at the end of June.  The shares fell 1.3 percent to 2.83 euros at 9:17 a.m. in
 Rome . They’ve declined 10.6 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 2.6 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
