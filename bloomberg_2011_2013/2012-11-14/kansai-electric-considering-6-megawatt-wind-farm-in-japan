Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503)  may
develop a 6-megawatt wind farm in Wakayama prefecture in western
 Japan .  The Osaka-based utility plans to conduct a study on any
environmental impact later this month to explore the possibility
of building the plant, Kazushige Akita, a Tokyo-based spokesman
for the utility, said by phone today.  The companyâ€™s 12-megawatt wind farm in Hyogo prefecture
began trial operations in July with full operations expected to
start in February, according to the spokesman. The utility is
also considering developing another 6-megawatt wind station in
Aichi prefecture, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
