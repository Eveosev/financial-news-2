Elliott Management Corp.’s NML
Capital Fund and other holders of defaulted Argentine bonds
urged a court not to allow the country to go forward with $3
billion in scheduled payments on restructured debt next month
without paying them as well.  Lawyers for the bondholders yesterday asked U.S. District
Judge Thomas Griesa in  Manhattan  to enforce rulings he made and
delayed that would require  Argentina  to pay on its defaulted
debt whenever it makes payments on the restructured debt.  In a Nov. 9 conference, Griesa said he will keep the orders
on hold until he rules on two remaining issues in the case,
which he said he will do by Dec. 1. Argentina is seeking a
longer stay so it can go forward with the December payments
while it tries to appeal.  A federal appeals court in  New York  ruled Oct. 26 that
Argentina can’t favor the restructured bondholders over holders
of defaulted notes. The nation yesterday asked for a rehearing,
either before the three-judge panel that ruled against it or
before the entire  U.S. Court of Appeals  in New York.  The case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 08-
CV-6978, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
