Japan moved closer to its fifth
straight appearance at soccer’s  World Cup  by beating Oman 2-1,
while Uzbekistan went atop its qualifying group after defeating
Iran 1-0.  Shinji Okazaki’s goal in the 89th minute last night handed
Oman its first home loss in Asia’s final qualifying stage for
the 2014 tournament in  Brazil . Japan tops Group B with 13 points
after five of eight matches.  “We kept chipping away and found a way to win in the
end,” Okazaki said on the website of tournament organizer FIFA.
“We weren’t in control today.”  The winners and runners-up from each  five-team group  take
the region’s four direct berths in the 2014 tournament, with the
third-place teams playing off for the right to take on  South
America ’s fifth-ranked nation for another spot.  Iraq improved its qualifying chances by beating Jordan 1-0
on Hammadi Ahmed’s goal in the 86th minute. Iraq is tied for
second place in Group B with Australia and Oman with five
points, one more than Jordan. The Socceroos have played one game
fewer than their rivals and play three of their four remaining
matches at home.  Ulughbek Bakaev scored the only goal as Uzbekistan won in
Tehran to take the Group A lead with eight points. Qatar beat
Lebanon 1-0 to tie Iran and  South Korea , which has played one
game fewer, for second place with seven points.  The next round of qualifying matches in  Asia  is scheduled
for March 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
