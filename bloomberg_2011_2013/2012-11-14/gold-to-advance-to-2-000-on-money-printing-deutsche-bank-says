Gold will probably rally to a record
above $2,000 an ounce next year as central banks ramp up
stimulus to sustain the recovery, according to Raymond Key,
London-based global head of metals trading at Deutsche Bank AG.  “We’ll take out $2,000, we’ll go higher,” Key said in an
interview in  Hong Kong , where he attended the London Bullion
Market Association’s annual conference. “That’s on the view
that they’ll continue to print money.”  Bullion is headed for a 12th annual gain on concern that
stimulus by governments and central banks around the world to
promote recovery from the global recession and combat the
fallout from  Europe ’s debt crisis will debase currencies and
spur inflation. Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded funds,
or ETFs, expanded to the biggest ever last week.  “Gold out of all the metals will be the best performer,”
Jeremy East, global head of metals trading and structured
inventory product at Standard Chartered Plc, said in a Nov. 12
interview. “The biggest driver of gold will be the ETF.”  Gold for immediate delivery, which rose to a record
$1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6, 2011, traded at $1,727.02 at 4:08
p.m. in Singapore, 10 percent higher this year. The metal
advanced 70 percent from December 2008 through June 2011 as the
 Federal Reserve  bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of
so-called quantitative easing.  ‘Takes Time’  “We’re still working out the excesses that we’ve seen in
the past,” Jamie Sokalsky, chief executive officer of Toronto-
based  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest producer, said in
a Nov. 12 interview. “This takes time, and easy monetary policy
is going to have to exist for some time.”  The Fed said Oct. 24 it will buy $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month and probably hold  interest rates  near zero until
2015 to boost economic growth and cut the jobless rate. The  Bank
of Japan  expanded an asset-purchase program on Oct. 30 for the
second time in two months and the  European Central Bank  has said
it is ready to buy bonds of indebted nations.  Attendees at the two-day LBMA event, which ended yesterday,
become less bullish about the prospects for bullion over the
course of the conference. Gold will probably gain to $1,849 by
September, according to the average response in a survey of
delegates yesterday. That’s down from a forecast for a gain to
$1,914, according to a separate survey of delegates on Nov. 12.  Jobs Data  Gold slumped to a nine-week low of $1,672.75 on Nov. 5 as
better-than-forecast U.S. jobs data strengthened the dollar. The
Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against six major
currencies including the euro, has gained 1.1 percent this year
as Europe’s fiscal crisis weighed on the euro.  “The outlook’s pretty positive for gold but people
shouldn’t expect too much, we’re dealing with a market that’s
fundamentally long,” said Deutsche Bank’s Key, referring to
bets on further gains. “The rally’s becoming more mature.”  Flows into ETFs may total 200 metric tons this year, from
175 tons in 2011, Barclays Plc said in a Nov. 8 report. That’s
4.6 percent of total physical supply of 4,323 tons this year,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on Barclays’ figures.  Brazil ,  South Korea  and  Russia  are among countries that
added gold to their reserves this year, data from the
International Monetary Fund show. Nations bought 254.2 tons in
the first half of 2012 and holdings are on pace to exceed the
456 tons added in 2011, Ashish Bhatia, manager of government
affairs at the producer-funded World Gold Council, said Nov. 11.  “With central banks continuing to buy gold around the
world and with the macroeconomic environment which is still
there, the demand should remain very strong,” said Barrick’s
Sokalsky. “We’re not going to see the reaction on the supply
side to make up for that in the industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
