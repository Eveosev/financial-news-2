The European Union should remove
carbon permits permanently to fix a supply glut and prop up
prices, Esa Hyvaerinen, a  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  spokesman, said by e-mail.  The comments come after the European Commission, the
regulator of the European Trading System, today released a
report on long-term options to address oversupply, complementing
a proposal on Nov. 12 to delay sales of credits in a process
known as backloading.  On EU proposals:  “The Commission’s proposal to postpone auctioning of 900
million allowances most likely will not impact the market price
significantly nor decrease market volatility. However, we
encourage the Commission to finalize the backloading as soon as
possible, followed by a permanent cancellation of allowances.”  On low prices for CO2 permits:  “This is largely a result of the economic downturn, but
also due to the intervention by overlapping, mostly national,
policy measures that have watered down the ETS mechanism. Fortum
considers it a serious shortcoming that the overlapping policy
measures have not been discussed at all as reasons for the
oversupply in the Carbon Market Report.”  On 2030 targets:  “Regarding the structural reform, an ambitious target for
2030 is Fortum’s key priority instead of increasing the 2020
target. Long-term targets combined with the tightening of the
ETS cap starting from 2021 could reduce the policy risk and
stimulate investments in the low-carbon future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
