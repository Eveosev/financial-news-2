Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto announced a series of measures to reshuffle the nation’s
ministries, including the creation of a new anti-corruption
agency.  Pena Nieto’s  Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI,
will propose in the lower house reducing the number of
ministries to 16 from 18 as part of an initiative to improve
government efficiency and performance, he said during a press
conference today in Mexico City.  The nation’s  Interior Ministry  would take control of
security matters and a new ministry dealing with urban and
agrarian development would be created, Pena Nieto said, speaking
alongside his party’s leaders in both chambers of Congress.  The new anti-corruption agency, to be proposed in the
Senate, would replace the Public Function Ministry, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
