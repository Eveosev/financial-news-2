Russia ’s space agency said it’s in
full contact with satellites and the International Space Station
after a broken cable caused it to use a backup system.  “A cable broke in the Moscow area, but that’s not
affecting the work of automatic space systems and the
International Space Station,” Alexey Kuznetsov, head of
Roskosmos’s press office, said today by phone from Moscow.
“Everything is under control.”  The cable break halted communications with civilian
satellites and Russia’s section of the space station, the state-
run RIA Novosti news service reported earlier. “It will be
fixed as quickly as possible,” Kuznetsov said, declining to
specify how long the repair would take.  To contact the reporter on this story:
