Britain’s Department for Education
will cut 1,000 back-office jobs as it seeks to reduce running
costs by half by 2015.  An earlier target of cutting administration costs by 42
percent was extended to 50 percent, the department said in an e-
mailed statement in  London  today. The ministry will have about
3,000 staff by the end of the process.  “Over the coming months we will target our staff time and
money on only our top priorities, cutting red tape and
concentrating on the work that adds the most value,” the
department said. “We are reducing the size of our back-room
staff and merging offices to reduce the cost of our buildings.”  The cuts are part of a broader program to squeeze spending
across departments as Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne
seeks to rid the U.K. of its budget deficit by 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
