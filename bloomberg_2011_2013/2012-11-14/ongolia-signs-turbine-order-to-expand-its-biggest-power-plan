Mongolia, struggling to add
transport and power infrastructure to match the country’s
commodity-driven economic growth, signed a turbine order that
will help boost capacity at its biggest generator by 21 percent.  The  Ural Turbine Works  agreed to supply and install a 120
megawatt steam turbine at the Ulan Bator power plant No. 4,
which supplies 70 percent of Mongolia’s electricity and heat,
Moscow-based Renova Group, which controls the Russian factory,
said in a statement yesterday. The turbine will begin operating
in 2014, Renova said.  Ulan Bator coal-fired power plant No.4 has an installed
capacity of 570 megawatts. The turbine order is Mongolia’s first
purchase of such equipment from  Russia  since the break-up of the
 Soviet Union  two decades ago, Renova said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
