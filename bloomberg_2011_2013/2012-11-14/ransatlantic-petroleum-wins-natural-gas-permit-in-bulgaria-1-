TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd. (TAT)  through
its unit Direct Petroleum Bulgaria EEOD won a 35-year permit to
drill and develop natural gas production in Bulgaria.  The permit covers an area of 2.3 square kilometers between
the northwestern cities of Pleven and Vratsa, the government
said in an e-mailed statement today. Direct Petroleum found a
natural gas deposit estimated at 6.6 billion cubic meters in
2009 near the village of Deventsi, near Pleven.  “We expect the company to start natural gas production in
the second half of next year, which will cover 10 percent of the
country’s demand,” Energy and Economy Minister Delyan Dobrev
told reporters in Sofia today. “Before that the company will
drill and will construct a pipeline to link the gas find in
Deventsi with the national grid.”  Bulgargaz AD,  Bulgaria ’s state-owned gas distributor, has
signed an agreement with Direct Petroleum to buy 80 percent of
its output at prices 35 percent lower than what it pays Russia’s
 OAO Gazprom (OGZD) , Dobrev said.  Gazprom pumps 17.8 billion cubic meters a year to  Turkey ,
 Greece  and Macedonia via Bulgaria. About 3 billion cubic meters
of that is consumed by Bulgaria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
