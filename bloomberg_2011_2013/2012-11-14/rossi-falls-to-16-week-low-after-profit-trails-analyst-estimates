Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3) , Brazil’s
fourth-biggest homebuilder by revenue, fell to its lowest level
in 16 weeks after posting earnings that trailed forecasts.  Shares sank 3.9 percent to 3.99 reais at 12:36 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo , and earlier declined to 3.96 reais, the lowest intraday
level since July 25. The benchmark Bovespa index slid 1 percent.  The company, based in Sao Paulo, reported third-quarter net
income of 19 million reais ($9.2 million) in a regulatory filing
yesterday. The average estimate for profit excluding one-time
charges was 47.4 million reais among eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, equaled 16 percent of
net sales, down from 22.6 percent in the previous quarter, Rossi
said.  “Results were still weak, mainly based on lower
operational margins,” Banco Itau BBA SA analysts including
David Lawant wrote in a note to clients.  Rossi’s shares trade at 4 times its reported earnings, the
fourth-cheapest among the Bovespa index’s 68 members, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
