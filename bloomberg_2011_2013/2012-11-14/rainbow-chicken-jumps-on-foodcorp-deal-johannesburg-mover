Rainbow Chicken Ltd. (RBW) , a South
African poultry producer, climbed to a two-month high in
Johannesburg trading after saying it will buy New Foodcorp
Holdings Ltd. to expand in sub-Saharan Africa.  Rainbow Chicken advanced 3.7 percent to 13.79 rand, the
highest since Sept. 12. About 2.3 million shares traded, the
highest daily volume this year.  The poultry producer plans a rights offer underwritten by
 Remgro Ltd. (REM)  to fund the deal, worth more than 1 billion rand
($113 million), the Durban-based company said today in a
statement. Foodcorp is the nation’s third-largest food company.  The company will embark on a series of transactions to buy
London-based BlueBay Asset Management LLP’s 46 percent stake in
New Foodcorp and a 22.5 percent holding owned by a Foodcorp
employee trust, it said. Once completed, Rainbow Chicken will
own 64 percent of Foodcorp, it said. The deal will broaden its
range to add items from peanut butter and meat pies to bread and
dog food.  The company’s  30-day historical volatility , a measure of
stock swings, increased to 25.09 from 22.69 yesterday. The
FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index’s  30-day volatility measure was 
at 9.17. A higher reading means an asset’s price can have bigger
moves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
