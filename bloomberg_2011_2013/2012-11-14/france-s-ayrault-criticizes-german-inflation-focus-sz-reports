French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault upbraided what he called an excessive focus on inflation
in  Germany  and said the two countries must work to increase
mutual understanding,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  Ayrault called for closer ties between the euro area’s two
biggest economies and pointed to “excessive disquiet” in
Germany, according to an interview he gave to the newspaper. He
will meet  Chancellor Angela Merkel  in Berlin tomorrow.  “Germany shouldn’t be worried only about inflation, but
also deflation,” Ayrault told Sueddeutsche in a preview of
tomorrow’s edition. “We need to speak to each other even more;
at the moment our mutual understanding is maybe insufficient.”  Ayrault spoke following criticism from officials in
Merkel’s government about the pace and substance of  France ’s
economic reforms. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble,
who spoke yesterday in Brussels at a joint press briefing with
French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, warned against calling
France the “sick man” of  Europe , saying the two countries
shouldn’t criticize each other.  “Our German friends should understand one thing: our
social model is based on social justice,” Ayrault told the
newspaper. He lauded German labor cooperation and said the
countries should establish energy cooperation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
