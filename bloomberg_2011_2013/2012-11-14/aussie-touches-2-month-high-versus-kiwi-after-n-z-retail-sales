Australia ’s dollar touched a two-
month high against its New Zealand counterpart after retail
sales in the smaller nation unexpectedly fell.  The so-called Aussie reached the strongest level in a week
against the U.S. dollar after reports showed Australia’s
 consumer confidence  rose to a 19-month high. Demand for both
South Pacific currencies was limited amid signs that  Europe ’s
debt crisis is hampering the region’s recovery.  “New Zealand’s economy isn’t showing robust growth at
present, and the retail sales didn’t help that,” said Hans Kunnen, the chief economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney.
“The pace of economic growth in Australia is firmer, and we
expect that to be reflected in the currency market.”  Australia’s dollar  touched NZ$1.2799, the highest level
since Sept. 10, before trading at NZ$1.2788 as of 4:48 p.m. in
Sydney, unchanged from yesterday. It rose to $1.0455, the
strongest since Nov. 7, before trading at $1.0448, 0.1 percent
higher. The Aussie advanced 0.3 percent to 83.08 yen. New
Zealand’s currency added 0.1 percent to 81.70 U.S. cents and
climbed 0.3 percent to 64.97 yen.  Retail sales, adjusted for inflation, dropped 0.4 percent
in the three months through September from the second quarter,
when they rose 1.3 percent, Statistics New Zealand said in
Wellington today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 0.4 percent increase.  In Australia, a consumer sentiment index for November
gained 5.2 percent to 104.3, the highest since April 2011, a
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne Institute survey showed
today in Sydney. Readings above 100 indicate optimists outnumber
pessimists  ‘Wage Pressure’  The nation’s  wage price index  increased 0.7 percent in the
third quarter from the prior three-month period, according to
the Australian Bureau of Statistics.  “If there is excessive wage pressure, it will make the RBA
more reluctant to ease further,” said St. George’s Kunnen,
referring to the Reserve Bank of Australia. “Current
expectations are for interest rates to be cut either in December
or February and if doubt is thrown on that, that would provide
some short-term boost to the Aussie.”  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 66 percent chance the RBA will lower its benchmark to 3
percent next month.  “The Australian dollar is strong,” said Yoshiko Takayasu,
the Tokyo-based head of corporate sales for National Australia
Bank Ltd. “There’s a 50-50 chance of a December rate cut. The
Aussie could test higher if the RBA refrains from easing.”  Best Performer  The Australian dollar rose 3.4 percent in the past month,
the best performer among 10 currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The kiwi gained 1.1 percent in the
same period.  The so-called Aussie and kiwi were also buoyed as
volatility ebbed, making investments more attractive in
currencies with higher lending rates. The JPMorgan G7 Volatility
Index sank to 7.2 percent matching yesterday’s low which was the
least since October 2007.  Australia’s  government bonds  were little changed, with the
benchmark 10-year note yielding 3.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
