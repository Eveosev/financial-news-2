U.S. stock futures maintained gains
after reports showed American wholesale prices and retail sales
fell in October.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring in December
advanced 0.4 percent to 1,376 at 8:36 a.m. in  New York .  Retail sales in the U.S. fell in October for the first time
in four months, influenced by the effects of superstorm Sandy,
which hurt receipts for some and helped for others.  The 0.3 percent drop followed a 1.3 percent increase in
September that was larger than previously reported, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
drop of 0.2 percent. The Commerce Department said it was able to
collect information from the storm-affected area, even as it was
not able to quantify its impact.  Wholesale prices unexpectedly fell for the first time in
five months as energy and vehicle costs dropped. The 0.2 percent
decline in the  producer price index  came after a 1.1 percent
increase the prior month, Labor Department figures showed today
in Washington. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 73
economists called for a 0.2 percent rise.  Excluding volatile food and energy, the so-called core
measure decreased 0.2 percent, the first drop since November
2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
