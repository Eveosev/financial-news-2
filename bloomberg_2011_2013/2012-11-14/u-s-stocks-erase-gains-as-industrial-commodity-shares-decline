U.S. stocks erased early gains as
industrial and commodity companies retreated, overshadowing an
advance in technology shares after Cisco Systems Inc.’s earnings
topped estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up less than 0.1
percent at 1,375.06 at 9:58 a.m. in New York after earlier
rallying as much as 0.4 percent. The gauge has declined almost 4
percent since President  Barack Obama ’s re-election on Nov. 6 set
up a showdown over the budget with the Republican-controlled
House of Representatives.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
