Funds led by Tiger Global Management
LLC warmed up to  Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s growth prospects in the third
quarter, adding to portfolios more than 15 million shares in the
operator of the world’s largest social network.  Tiger Global, the $8 billion hedge fund, added 9.79 million
shares to boost its stake to 11.75 million shares, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Jennison Associates LLC increased
its holding by a third, adding 3.01 million shares, and
Clearbridge Advisors LLC added 2.54 million shares, an increase
of more than 400 percent.  The  purchases  came as Facebook, which has lost more than 40
percent of its value since going public in May, has been working
to assuage investor concerns over its valuation. The company
demonstrated in the third quarter that it can boost advertising
revenue from mobile users as people increasingly turn to
wireless devices to access the social network.  Other funds, including large holders, boosted their stake
in  Facebook  as well. Vanguard Group Inc. added 4.3 million
shares, an increase of 45 percent, while T. Rowe Price
Associates Inc. added 740,309 shares, a 3.8 percent rise.
Capital Research Global Investors more than doubled its stake by
adding 14.6 million shares.  Facebook, based in Menlo Park,  California , fell less than 1
percent to $22.17 at the close in New York. Yesterday, the
shares rose 13 percent, the second-largest gain since the IPO.  The rise came even as restrictions lifted yesterday on 804
million shares held by former employees and those who sold at
the initial public offering, almost doubling the total publicly
available, according to a regulatory filing.  During the third quarter, Facebook’s sales rose 32 percent
to $1.26 billion, helped by new mobile-advertising tools that
delivered about $150 million in  revenue .  Some institutional investors backed out of the stock or
gave up completely on Facebook during the quarter.  Marsico Capital Management LLC sold all of its 5.85 million
shares during the quarter, making it one of the biggest holders
to liquidate all its holdings. Winslow Capital Management Inc.
unloaded nearly as many, 4.59 million shares.  Hoplite Capital Management LLC reduced its holdings by
284,000 to 1 million shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
