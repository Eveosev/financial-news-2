City Developments Ltd. (CIT) ,  Singapore ’s
second-largest developer, said third-quarter profit rose 1.8
percent, boosted by contributions from its office buildings. It
also said the city may face a possible oversupply of homes.  Net income  climbed to S$134.5 million ($110 million) in the
three months ended Sept. 30, from S$132.1 million a year earlier,
it said in a statement to the Singapore stock exchange today.
Sales increased 3.4 percent to S$832.9 million.  Singapore’s September home sales rose 84 percent to the
highest in more than three years as developers sold more
apartments, according to the  Urban Redevelopment Authority .  “While the outlook for the  property market  in the medium
to long-term is still positive, the group is cognizant that
between 2014 and 2015, there could be some oversupply with more
residential units being completed,” it said in the statement.
“However, this fear will be unwarranted if the world economy
turns around by that time.”  Pretax profit from its rental properties including office
buildings more than doubled to S$71.2 million, it said in the
statement. Property development fell 41 percent to S$76.5
million, while contributions from hotels dropped 20 percent to
S$55.7 million.  The developer said it sold 48 of 55 units it put up for
sale at UP@Robertson Quay close to the city’s downtown. The
Palette, a joint venture project with 892 units in northeastern
Singapore, is more than 94 percent sold, it said.  City Developments opened its 240-room W Singapore Sentosa
Cove hotel on Oct. 20. The developer also won a joint bid by its
unit and Intrepid Investments Pte to develop a residential and
office plot in Tai Thong Crescent. The joint venture company
paid S$245 million for the site, it said in a statement in
September.  The company’s  shares  fell 1.7 percent to S$11.33 at the
close of trading in Singapore. The stock has gained 27 percent
this year, compared with the 13 percent advance in Singapore’s
benchmark  Straits Times Index. (FSSTI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
