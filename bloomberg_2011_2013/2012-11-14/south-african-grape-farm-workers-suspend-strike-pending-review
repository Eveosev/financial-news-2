South African farmworkers in the
grape growing region of Western Cape Province suspended a week
old strike to allow the government to review minimum wages after
protests that saw vineyards and houses set alight.  “An agreement between government and labor suspends the
strike for two weeks and workers will return to work tomorrow,”
the Congress of South African Trade Unions said today in an e-
mailed statement. “Should the new minimum not be acceptable,
then workers will continue their strike on Dec. 4.”  The farmworkers, mostly not unionized, have been protesting
since Nov. 6 in demand of a daily wage of 150 rand ($17), while
farmers offered 80 rand. They will earn a minimum 80 rand in the
next two weeks as the review is finished and disciplinary action
won’t be taken against those who went on strike, Cosatu said.  AgriSA, the country’s main farmers’ organization, plans to
hold a press conference on the labor action today.  Labor unrest has rocked mining and manufacturing in  South
Africa , where a quarter of workers are unemployed and almost a
third of the 51.8 million population depends on welfare.  To contact the reporter on this story:
