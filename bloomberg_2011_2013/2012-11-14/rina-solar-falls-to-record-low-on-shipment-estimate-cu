Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , the renewable
energy company that’s declared a loss for the last four
quarters, fell to a record low in New York as investors sold the
stock in response to a cut in its preliminary shipment
estimates.  Trina’s American depositary receipts, equivalent to 50
ordinary shares,  declined  19 percent to $2.63 at the close, the
lowest since public trading began in 2006. Trading volume was
more than double the three-month average. The  Bloomberg Global
Large Solar Index (BISOLAR)  fell 5.3 percent to its lowest level.  “Clearly someone’s dumping the stock, and usually when you
see this type of heavy, heavy selling, my interpretation is that
it’s a big seller or two,” Aaron Chew, an analyst at Maxim
Group LLC in  New York , said by phone today. The sell-off of the
Changzhou, China-based company is “a delayed reaction” to
Trina’s Nov. 12 statement on third-quarter estimates, he said.  Trina cut its estimate for third-quarter shipments 20
percent to as much as 385 megawatts from as much as 480
megawatts. The company blamed a supply-demand imbalance and
“irrational pricing practices” by competitors. Trina is
scheduled to release third-quarter results Nov. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
