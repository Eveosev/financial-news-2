The pound extended its decline
against the euro and pared an advance against the dollar after
the  Bank of England  said the U.K. economy may shrink in the
current quarter as it cut its outlook.  The U.K. currency weakened 0.3 percent to 80.25 pence at
10:35 a.m. London time and was little changed at $1.5880. It
strengthened as much as 0.2 percent to $1.5901 earlier.  “The weaker gross domestic product profile reflects the
judgment that the broader causes and repercussions of the
financial crisis may bear down more forcefully on demand and
productivity than assumed” previously, the central bank said in
its quarterly Inflation Report published in London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
