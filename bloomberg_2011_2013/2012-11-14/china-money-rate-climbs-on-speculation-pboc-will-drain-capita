China ’s money-market rate climbed
for a second day on speculation the central bank will drain cash
from the financial market this week to prevent a rebound in
inflation.  The People’s Bank of China last week withdrew 101 billion
yuan ($16.2 billion) of capital, compared with an injection of
379 billion yuan in the five days through Nov. 2, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg. The PBOC yesterday kept the  yield  on
seven-day reverse-repurchase contracts, which add cash to the
system, unchanged at 3.35 percent for a 15th sale.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 18 basis points to 3.35 percent as
of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  “The market speculates the central bank will drain some
capital this week to guide the seven-day repo rate back to 3.35
percent, which appears to be the level desired by the central
bank,” said Wang Huane, a senior bond trader in Jinan at Qilu
Bank Co.  A total of 404 billion  yuan  of reverse-repurchase contracts
will mature this week, draining capital from banks, according to
data compiled by China Merchants Bank. The central bank
conducted a total of 186 billion yuan of reverse-repo operation
yesterday.  Consumer prices  in China climbed 1.7 percent from a year
earlier, the least since January 2010, the statistics bureau
reported on Nov. 9.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.22 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
