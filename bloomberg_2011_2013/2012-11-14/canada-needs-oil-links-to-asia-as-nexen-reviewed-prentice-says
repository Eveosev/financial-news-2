Canada  should build oil and gas
links to Asia as the government reviews  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s bid for
 Nexen Inc. (NXY) , said Jim Prentice, vice chairman of Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce and an ex-industry minister.  “Canada is right now aggressively engaged in diversifying
its energy markets with an eye to Asia” because the U.S. is its
only customer and is increasing production itself, Prentice said
in a speech at the Oil & Money conference in London today.
“Saying ‘no thanks’ to the largest new market opportunity,
namely  China , would be patently unwise.”  Prentice said he doesn’t know if Canada will approve
Beijing-based Cnooc’s proposed $15.1 billion takeover of Nexen
after extending its review for a second time to Dec. 10. The
government should focus on whether Nexen will continue to
operate transparently if Cnooc buys it, he said.  “The fundamental point is that the Canadian government
should not be –- and, in my view, won’t be –- concerned about
the so-called ethnicity of money,” he said.  “The question must instead be whether the capital in
question, once lodged in Canada, will adhere to market
principles and to North American standards of governance and
transparency,” Prentice said. “If so, then it should be
welcomed. If not, then the investments should be scrutinized
closely and potentially refused.”  Cnooc Chairman Wang Yilin said Nov. 9 he’s confident the
deal can be done by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
