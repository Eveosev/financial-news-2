Swiss  investor confidence  remained
little changed in November, suggesting the economy may struggle
to regain strength.  An index of investor and analyst expectations that aims to
predict economic developments six months in advance rose to
minus 27.9 from minus 28.9 in October, the ZEW Center for
European Economic Research in  Mannheim , Germany, and Zurich-
based  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said in a statement today. A gauge
of the economic situation rose to zero from minus 4.4.  The Swiss economy is cooling as the euro area’s fiscal
crisis and waning global growth erode export demand, forcing
companies to lower costs. Gross domestic product unexpectedly
declined in the three months through June and Economy Minister
Johann Schneider-Ammann said on Nov. 6 that “growth in the
third quarter probably disappointed.” The Swiss government will
release third-quarter GDP on Nov. 29.  “Most analysts surveyed do not expect the economic
situation to change much over the next six months,” Credit
Suisse said. “Based on their expectations, economic growth
should therefore remain subdued.”  The Swiss survey was conducted among 43 analysts between
Oct. 29 and Nov. 9. In  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy,
investor confidence unexpectedly declined in November, with a
gauge falling to minus 15.7 from minus 11.5 in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
