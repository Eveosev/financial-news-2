The cost for European banks to
convert euro interest payments into dollars fell from the
highest in more than two months, according to a money-markets
indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to borrow in dollars, was 27 basis points below the euro
interbank offered rate at 8:15 a.m. in  London  from minus 28
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The measure was the
most expensive since Sept. 5.  The one-year basis swap was 30 basis points, or 0.30
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 29 yesterday.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another rose for a second day. The difference
between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-
OIS spread, was 12.3 basis points from 12 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was 0.08 percent
yesterday from 0.082 percent the day before. The Eonia swap, an
estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the next
three months, was the lowest since Sept. 3 at 7 basis points
from 7.2 yesterday.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the  European Central Bank 
to 239 billion euros ($304 billion) yesterday, the lowest since
Dec. 19, from 252 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
