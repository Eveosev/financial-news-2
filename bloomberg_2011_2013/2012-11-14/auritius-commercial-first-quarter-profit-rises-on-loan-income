Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the
country’s largest lender by market value, said first-quarter
profit rose 7.5 percent as income from loans grew.  Net income climbed to 1.14 billion rupees ($37 million) in
the three months through September, from 1.06 billion rupees a
year earlier, the Port Louis-based lender said today in a
statement e-mailed by Anglo-Mauritius Stockbrokers Ltd. Net
interest income, the amount banks earn from interest charges on
loans, increased 11 percent to 1.75 billion rupees as loans
advanced to 135.9 billion rupees from 125.8 billion rupees.  “Considering the difficult operating context, this is a
satisfactory performance, stemming from MCB’s business-
development initiative aimed at diversifying its markets and
continuously improving customer service,” the bank said.
Results for the first half “are expected to reflect the trend
shown in the first quarter,” it said.  MCB, as the lender is known, has a 24 percent weight in the
 40-member SEMDEX gauge , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The stock has declined 3 percent this year, compared with a 12
percent drop in the index. The shares traded unchanged at 162
rupees today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
