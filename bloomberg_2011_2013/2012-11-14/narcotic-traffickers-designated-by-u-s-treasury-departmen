The U.S. Treasury Department said it
named two people, Ovaldino Lorenzana Cordon and Marta Julia
Lorenzana Cordon, as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers
as part of an effort to thwart transnational drug cartels.  The members of Lorenzana family were “key operatives”
connected to a Guatemalan drug trafficker Waldemar Lorenzana
Lima, the Treasury Department said today in a statement.  The move prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial
or commercial transaction with the designated individuals and
freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction,
according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
