David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays
won the Cy Young Award as the American League’s top pitcher this
season after leading the league in earned run average and tying
for the league lead with 20 wins.  Price, 27, a left-hander, had an ERA of 2.56 and posted a
20-5 record while being selected as an All-Star for the third
straight season.  Price won the award with 153 points in balloting by the
Baseball Writers’ Association of America. Justin Verlander of
the Detroit Tigers, who won the award last year, was second with
149 votes.  The four-point differential is the closest of any election
since ballots permitted voting for more than one pitcher in 1970,
the BBWAA said on its website.  Jered Weaver of the Los Angeles Angels was third in the
voting with 70 points.  The National League Cy Young Award winner will be announced
later today from among finalists R.A. Dickey of the  New York 
Mets, Gio Gonzalez of the Washington Nationals and Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers.  The last of the BBWAA’s annual awards will be announced
tomorrow when the Most Valuable Players in the AL and NL are
revealed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
