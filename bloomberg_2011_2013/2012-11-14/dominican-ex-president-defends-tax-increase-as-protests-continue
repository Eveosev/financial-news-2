Former  Dominican Republic  President
Leonel Fernandez defended his government’s spending in a
televised address to the nation as his successor struggles to
quell violent protests over tax increases in the Caribbean
nation.  In his first public address since the Aug. 16 inauguration
of President Danilo Medina, Fernandez said a tax overhaul
approved by Congress on Nov. 8 would generate additional revenue
to fund education, health and security. The legislation
increases the national sales tax to 18 percent from 16 percent
and raises other levies in an attempt to trim the country’s
fiscal deficit, which the government forecasts will climb to 8
percent of gross domestic product by year-end.  Protesters rallied in Santo Domingo last night to
“demonstrate against impunity and corruption,” Maribel
Hernandez of the Fiscal Justice Movement said in an e-mailed
statement. A series of protests in the country last week left
two people dead.  The Dominican Republic’s economy averaged annual economic
growth of 7 percent under Fernandez. His wife, Margarita Cedeno,
is Medina’s vice president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
