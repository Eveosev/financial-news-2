Olympic downhill skiing champion
 Lindsey Vonn  went home from a Colorado hospital as doctors tried
to determine the cause of what her spokesman described as severe
intestinal pain.  Vonn, a 28-year-old American, checked into the hospital in
Vail, Colorado, three days ago.  “Lindsey is feeling much better today and has been
released from the hospital,” spokesman Lewis Kay said yesterday
in an e-mailed statement. “She is resting comfortably at home.
Doctors are still working to determine what specifically was the
cause of her illness, but thankfully she has responded well to
their treatment.”  Vonn was in Colorado to prepare for World Cup races on Nov.
24-25 in Aspen. She skipped last weekend’s slalom races in Levi,
 Finland , to prepare for the U.S. swing. When she’ll be able to
return to skiing is unknown, Kay said.  Vonn, who lives in Vail and was born in St. Paul,
Minnesota, won a gold medal in the downhill and a bronze in the
super-giant slalom at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. In
World Cup competition, she’s a four-time overall champion (2008,
2009, 2010 and 2012), and has been the downhill champion each
year since 2008 and the super-G champion each year since 2009.  A 12-year U.S. Ski Team member, Vonn is also a high-profile
endorser, working with brands including car company  Audi AG (NSU) ,
watchmaker Rolex Group, sporting goods company  Under Armor Inc. (UA) ,
energy drink maker Red Bull GmbH and  Vail Resorts Inc. (MTN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
