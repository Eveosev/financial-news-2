Banking regulators including the
Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. encouraged
financial institutions to help customers in regions harmed by
 Hurricane Sandy .  Banks should take “all reasonable and prudent steps” to
help borrowers’ cash and financial needs knowing that such
efforts “will not be subject to examiner criticism,” the
regulators said in a statement today in Washington.  The statement from the Fed, FDIC, National Credit Union
Administration and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
said such steps may include modifying loans, waiving ATM fees,
increasing ATM withdrawal limits or easing restrictions on
cashing out-of-state checks.  Such steps “could help customers recover financial
strength and contribute to the health of the local community and
the long-term interests of institutions and their customers when
undertaken in a prudent manner,” the regulators said. The
actions “may not be feasible or desirable for all
institution,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
