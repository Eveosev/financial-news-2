President Richard Fisher said the U.S. central bank can’t act as
a backstop for the economy should lawmakers fail to prevent the
country from going over the so-called fiscal cliff.  “I do not see us as that safety net” in the event that
Congress fails to reach an agreement, Fisher said in an
interview on CNBC today. “We just can’t continue down the road
of an infinite expansion of monetary policy.”  The Congressional Budget Office has forecast that the $607
billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases slated to
take effect Jan. 1 would put the economy into a recession next
year. Gross domestic product would shrink by 0.5 percent and
joblessness climb to about 9 percent if it isn’t averted,
according to the CBO.  Fisher, who doesn’t vote on the policy-setting Federal Open
Market Committee this year, has been among the most vocal
critics of further easing within the central bank. The FOMC last
month voted to continue buying $40 billion in mortgage bonds per
month until the employment outlook improves.  U.S. growth is currently “positive and anemic” and isn’t
“fast enough,” he said in the interview today. Inflation and
inflation expectations have remained “under control,” he
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
