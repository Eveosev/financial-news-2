Steinway Musical Instruments Inc. (LVB) ,
the maker of its namesake pianos, agreed to sell its building
near  Manhattan ’s Carnegie Hall for $195 million.  The company anticipates proceeds of $56.3 million, of which
$20 million will be held in escrow until Steinway vacates the
space it occupies, according to a regulatory  filing  signed by
Chief Executive Officer Michael Sweeney. The filing didn’t
include a buyer or say when or whether Steinway would leave the
building.  Steinway Hall, at 109 W. 57th St., is the flagship store of
the company’s Steinway & Sons unit, according to its  website .
It’s described as a Beaux Arts landmark, with a 19th-century
Viennese crystal chandelier and ceiling decorated with
allegorical scenes of lions, elephants, goddesses and nymphs,
painted by artist Paul Arndt.  The transaction is expected to be completed before the end
of the year, Waltham, Massachusetts-based Steinway said in the
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
