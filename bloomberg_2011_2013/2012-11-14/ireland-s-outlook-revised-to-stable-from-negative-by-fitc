Fitch Ratings  raised its outlook on
Ireland to stable from negative, citing the government’s actions
to narrow the fiscal deficit and a view that the nation’s banks
probably won’t need further state  capital.   “Fiscal consolidation remains on track, broadly in line
with the original trajectory of the EU-IMF programme, which
envisaged a 120 percent debt to GDP ratio in 2012, peaking in
2013-14 before declining,” the ratings firm said in a
statement, where it affirmed it BBB+ rating on the nation.   Still, Ireland’s rating remains “constrained and faces
downside risk” due to high public and private debt levels.   The yield on Ireland’s benchmark security due in October
2020 fell five basis points to 4.72 percent today, down from 14
percent in July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
