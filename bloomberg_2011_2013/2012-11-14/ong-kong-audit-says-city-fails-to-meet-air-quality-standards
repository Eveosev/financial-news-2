  Hong Kong  has failed to meet its
own air quality objectives set in 1987, with pollution levels
much higher than comparable cities globally, according to a
government audit report.  Pollution has worsened since 2007, with the number of days
marked as having very high level of pollution rising to 175 in
2011, from 74 in 2007, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
