Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) ,  Australia ’s
largest carrier, rose the most in more than two months after
saying it would buy as much as A$100 million ($104 million) of
its own shares with cash from cutting a  Boeing Co. (BA)  order.  The airline will repurchase as much as 4 percent of its
stock from December and has hired Citigroup Inc. to broker the
transaction, according to a regulatory statement today. That
will be Qantas’s first share buyback in more than four years,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Qantas will also repay
A$650 million of debt early, including redeeming its 5.125
percent June 2013 bonds five months before they mature, it said.  “The current Qantas share price does not reflect fair
value of the group,” Leigh Clifford, Qantas’s chairman, said in
the statement.  Qantas  shares  rose 4.1 percent to close at A$1.28 in
Sydney, their biggest gain since Sept. 7. The stock has climbed
32 percent from a record low reached June 8 after Alan Joyce,
chief executive officer, forecast the Sydney-based company would
post its first loss since listing in 1995.  It has since announced a partnership with Emirates to turn
around international losses, canceled an order for 35 Boeing 787
Dreamliners, and quit a parcel delivery joint venture with
Australia Post, the country’s government-owned mail service.  A settlement with Boeing and the sale of Qantas’s stake in
the road freight venture will deliver net proceeds of A$750
million this financial year, which Qantas will use to fund the
share buyback and debt reduction, the airline said today.  Underlying  profit  in the six months through December will
be between A$180 million and A$230 million, the company said.
 Capital spending  during the year,  previously forecast  at A$1.9
billion, will be reduced by a further A$100 million.  The outlook for the full year “remains volatile”, the
company said, saying it was unable to provide further guidance
at present.  To contact the reporter on this story:
