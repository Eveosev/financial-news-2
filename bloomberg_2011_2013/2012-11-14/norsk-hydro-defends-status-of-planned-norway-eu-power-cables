Planned power cables linking  Norway 
to  Germany  and the U.K. must not be reserved for state
ownership, according to  Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY) , Norway’s largest
private electricity producer.  A government proposal for state ownership  “goes too
far,” Morten Roesaeg, director of energy supply and development
at Norsk Hydro, Norway’s second-biggest hydropower producer and
the country’s largest power user, said today in a  response 
published on the oil and energy ministry’s website.  The Norwegian government said all cross-border power cables
from Norway should be under state ownership through grid company
Statnett SF, in a public  consultation  on proposals to amend the
energy act, posted on the website on Sept. 18.  NorthConnect, owned by  Sweden ’s Vattenfall AB and the
U.K.’s  SSE Plc (SSE) , as well as Norway’s E-CO Energi AS, Agder Energi
AS and Lyse Energi AS, plans to build a 1,400-megawatt cable
linking Norway to the U.K. by 2020.  A growing power surplus in the region means that cables to
EU countries may be used for “commercial purposes”, to strike
profits from power exports, a function which is ill-suited for a
publicly owned grid operator and better fits private companies,
Norsk Hydro said in the response to the consultation which will
end on Nov. 16.  More than 50 terawatt-hours of new annual output through
2017 may push down Nordic power prices, Per Lekander, an analyst
at UBS AG bank, said on Oct. 2 by telephone. The projected
generation compares with annual Danish power demand of 34.4
terawatt-hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
