NetApp Inc. (NTAP)  surged the most in more
than two years after second-quarter profit beat estimates and
the maker of data-storage products expanded its share repurchase
program by $1.5 billion.  The  shares  of Sunnyvale, California-based NetApp advanced
11 percent to $30.20 at the close in  New York , the biggest gain
since May 2010. The  stock  pared its loss for the year to 17
percent.  Earnings excluding some items for the fiscal second
quarter, which ended Oct. 26, were 51 cents a share, the company
said in a statement. That topped analysts’ average projection of
48 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. NetApp
forecast third-quarter profit of 53 cents to 58 cents a share,
compared with a 54-cent average estimate.  “Management clearly executed well through a challenging
macro environment in which we expected to see more of an adverse
impact on results than was the case,” Maynard Um, an analyst at
Wells Fargo Securites, wrote in a research report. “The quarter
should, for the time being, alleviate concerns that competition
is having a meaningful impact on NetApp as product gross margin
improved.”  NetApp also said it agreed to buy CacheIQ Inc., a closely
held storage solutions company based in Austin,  Texas . Terms
weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
