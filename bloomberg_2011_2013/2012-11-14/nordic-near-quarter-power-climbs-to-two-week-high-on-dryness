Nordic power for January through
March declined as wetter conditions were predicted in the
hydropower-dependent region.  Electricity for delivery in the next quarter fell 1.1
percent to 40.60 euros ($51.72) a megawatt-hour as of 2:45 p.m
on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. Power for
December traded at 38.80 euros, down 0.8 percent, after falling
as low as 38.75 euros.  Weather forecasts showed more rain than earlier today, with
the surplus compared with the seasonal average set to rise by 11
percent to 9.65 terawatt-hours in the next week, Markedskraft AS
data on Bloomberg show. The Nordic region meets more than half
its power needs by running  water through turbines . Norway’s
water reservoirs were 85.5 percent full on Nov. 11, 1.1
percentage points above normal, the country’s water and energy
directorate said today.  “The market is fundamentally overvalued,” Coeli AB, the
Stockholm-based hedge fund manager in charge of the Power Surge
fund, said today in an e-mailed report. “The hydrological
surplus remains large.”  The benchmark near-quarter and the April-June contracts may
fall further, “but not too much,” amid abundant supplies of
hydropower and nuclear output, Bixia AB,  Sweden ’s fourth-largest
power trading company said today in a report. The second-quarter
contract fell 1.1 percent to 34.30 euros.  The contract for 2013 delivery, which last traded at 37.30
euros, down 1.1 percent from yesterday, may slide as low as 36
euros as a result of the weak economic outlook in debt-ridden
European economies, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
