Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330)  jumped in Hong
Kong trading after former chairman Michael Ying doubled his
stake, fueling speculation the billionaire will help turn around
the retailer battling a sales slump.  Esprit climbed 22 percent in Hong Kong trading to HK$12.96,
the most since Aug. 7, after surging as much as 33 percent. Ying
raised his stake on Nov. 7 to 10.3 percent from  4.8 percent ,
according to  filings  on the Hong Kong stock exchange website.  Ying helped oversee Esprit’s global expansion and a sales
surge during a 13-year tenure as chairman that ended in 2006.
The Hong Kong-based clothier has missed estimates in the last
five years, saying the brand has “lost its soul” as
competitors such as  Inditex SA (ITX) ’s Zara drew customers away.  With a stake of more than 10 percent, Ying is able to call
for a special general meeting and propose resolutions, Anne Ling, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Hong Kong, wrote in a
research note to clients.  “We believe investors’ initial view will be positive,
offering ‘comfort’ as Esprit performed strongly under his
leadership,” Ling wrote. “The market will anticipate Mr. Ying
taking a more active role in the company.”  Ying, who is now Esprit’s second-largest shareholder,
hasn’t signaled an intention to join the board, nor has the
company “pro-actively” asked him to, Esprit Chairman Raymond
Or said on a conference call today. The board would consider him
if he wanted to participate, Or said.  Contribution  Or said he has always been in contact with Ying and doesn’t
know when the former chairman became a shareholder. The company
welcomes anyone who makes a contribution to operations, he said,
adding that the company sees the need to strengthen the board
and could seek out independent directors.  Based on Esprit’s current market value of HK$25.1 billion,
a 10.3 percent stake is worth about HK$2.6 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The clothier was started in 1968, when Susie and Doug
Tompkins sold clothes out of the back of a station wagon in San
Francisco. Esprit Far East Group began operating in the 1970s
when the couple met Ying, according to the company’s  website .  During Ying’s tenure, Esprit’s sales surged 30-fold to
HK$23.3 billion in the year ended June 2006 from HK$769.7
million in 1993, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue has dropped in three of the past four years on
competition from clothing chains such as  Hennes & Mauritz AB. (HMB)   Billionaire  Forbes  estimates Ying’s net worth at $2.5 billion. The
former chairman cut his stake after leaving the post, raising
$160 million by selling 22.8 million shares in March 2010. He
owned 93 million shares, or 4.8 percent, before the latest
purchase.  “We have to monitor developments as to whether Mr. Ying
will be a passive or active investor,” Deutsche Bank’s Ling
said.  Ying was buying shares at the same time that Lone Pine
Capital LLC cut its effective stake to 10.9 percent. It sold
62.5 million nil-paid rights shares in two transactions, on Nov.
7 and Nov. 9, according to a  filing .  Separately,  Easyknit International Holdings Ltd. (1218)  said Nov.
13 that it bought 850,000 common shares and 1.1 million nil-paid
rights shares of Esprit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
