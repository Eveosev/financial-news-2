Indonesia ’s rupiah fell, dropping
for a fifth week, after foreign funds pulled money from local
stocks and demand for the dollar increased before the end of a
shortened week. Government bonds advanced.  The currency matched a three-year low yesterday as overseas
investors sold $68 million more local shares than they bought
that day, exchange data show. Euro-area finance ministers will
convene an “extraordinary meeting” on Nov. 20 to discuss
Greece’s financing needs.  “There is strong demand for the dollar from corporates,”
Artanavaro Gasali, head of global markets at PT Bank ICBC
Indonesia in Jakarta, said by telephone. “Greece is a big issue
affecting the major markets.”  The rupiah fell 0.1 percent today and this week to 9,634
per dollar as of 3:32 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg show. Financial markets will be shut
tomorrow and Nov. 16 for public holidays. The currency touched
9,668 yesterday, matching levels reached on Nov. 12 and Nov. 7
that were the weakest since October 2009.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, dropped 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 4.7 percent.  Greece  yesterday sold 4 billion euros ($5.1 billion) of
bills before 5 billion euros of debt comes due on Nov. 16. Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras today said the government is fighting
for more than 31 billion euros of aid.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell five basis points to 5.42 percent, the lowest level since
February, according to Inter Dealer Market Association. The
yield dropped 14 basis points this week.  The Southeast Asian government plans to sell an undisclosed
amount of 10-year dollar-denominated Islamic bonds at a yield of
3.5 percent, according to people familiar with the matter who
asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
