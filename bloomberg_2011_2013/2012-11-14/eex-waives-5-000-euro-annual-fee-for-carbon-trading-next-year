The European Energy Exchange AG will
waive its 5,000-euro ($6,370) annual fee for buyers who register
before Dec. 31 to participate only in its European Union carbon
permit market next year.  The Leipzig, Germany-based bourse also introduced a new
rebate schedule for trading in  spot  and future carbon permits in
its secondary market, it said in an e-mailed statement today.
The exchange will charge 60 euro cents a metric ton in exchange
and clearing fees for spot monthly trading volume of less than
1,000 lots, or 1 million tons, and as little as 40 cents a ton
for monthly spot trade in excess of 5 million tons.  Exchange and clearing fees for derivatives contracts will
range from 10 cents a ton for trade in excess of 15 million tons
a month to 28 cents a ton for less than 3 million tons a month,
the exchange said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
