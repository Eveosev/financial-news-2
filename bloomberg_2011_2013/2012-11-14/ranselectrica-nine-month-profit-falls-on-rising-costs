Transelectrica SA (TEL) ,  Romania ’s power-
grid operator, said nine-month profit plunged 87 percent because
of a widening financial loss and surging costs.  Net income fell to 19.2 million lei ($5.4 million) in the
first nine months of the year from 153.5 million lei in the same
period last year, the Bucharest-based utility said in a
 regulatory filing  to the stock exchange in the capital today.
Revenue rose 5 percent to 2.18 billion lei, while expenses
surged 14 percent to 2.15 billion lei.  Transelectrica has increased spending to modernize and
expand its outdated power grid to accommodate to a boom in wind-
power generation, as Romania’s renewable energy incentives plan
attracts investors in the country, including  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA and
Enel Green Power SpA.  The state-owned utility’s financial loss widened in the
first nine months of this year to 65 million lei compared to a
loss of 28 million lei in the same period of last year,
according to the statement.  “The financial operations took into account the
depreciation of the local currency against the main currencies
in which Transelectrica took external loans for investments,
namely euro, dollar and Japanese yen,” the company said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
