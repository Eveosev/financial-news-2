The European Commission is limiting
options to mend a supply glut in the bloc’s carbon market,
according to the International Emissions Trading Association.  “Given the gravity of the issues at stake, IETA expresses
concern that the commission appears to be considering only a
limited number of options,” the Geneva-based lobby group said
today in an e-mailed statement. “At this early stage in the
debate, now might not be the best time to rule out particular
options,” the group said, without being specific.  Dirk Forrister, IETA’s president, didn’t immediately return
a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
