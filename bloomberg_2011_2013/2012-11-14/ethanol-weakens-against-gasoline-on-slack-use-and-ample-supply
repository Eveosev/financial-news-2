Ethanol futures in  Chicago  weakened
against gasoline on reduced demand and ample supply.  The additive’s discount to the motor fuel expanded to 33.6
cents a gallon from 31.68 cents yesterday, based on December
futures prices. Gasoline’s premium was 99.8 cents on Sept. 28.  Ethanol  stockpiles  of 18.1 million barrels in the week
ended Nov. 2 were 10 percent higher than a year earlier,
according to Energy Department data released Nov. 7.  Consumption
of gasoline  fell the most since Jan. 7, 2005, after  Hurricane
Sandy  shut filling stations and kept drivers off the roads in
the heavily populated U.S. Northeast.  “The underlying fundamentals aren’t changing that much and
that’s why the price isn’t changing that much,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for December delivery climbed 0.6 cent,
or 0.3 percent, to $2.343 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have risen 6.4 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery advanced 2.52 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.679 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for March delivery gained 3 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$7.2925 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Losing Money  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 29
cents on yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be made from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Companies have tempered production because of price
declines. New Energy Corp., operator of an ethanol plant in
 South Bend ,  Indiana , filed for  bankruptcy protection  Nov. 9 with
plans to sell its assets.  Ethanol  production  has fallen 14 percent this year to
827,000 barrels a day, or 12.3 billion gallons on an annualized
basis, as of Nov. 2, Energy Department data show.  The agency plans to release supply data at 11 a.m. tomorrow
in  Washington , a day later than usual because of the Veterans
Day holiday on Nov. 12.  Ethanol prices “can’t go a lot lower or it shuts too much
production and it can’t go too high because people would come
online and produce too much,” Blackford said. “The market’s
doing what it should be doing, which is staying flat.”  Prices would rise if imports waned and demand from foreign
buyers increased, he said.  Ethanol  exports  in August, the most recent month for which
data is available from the Energy Department, averaged 39,000
barrels a day, the lowest level since November 2010.  The country became a  net importer  of ethanol in August for
the first time since November 2010, according to the Energy
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
