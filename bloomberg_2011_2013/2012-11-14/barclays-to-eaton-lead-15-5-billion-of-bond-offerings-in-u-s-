Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Eaton Corp. (ETN)  led
borrowers in the U.S. selling about $17.5 billion of debt today
as firms capitalize on rates at about  record lows .  The U.K.’s second-largest lender sold $3 billion of 10-year
subordinated notes that can be written off in a crisis, and
Cleveland-based Eaton issued $4.9 billion of securities in five
parts to fund its $11.8 billion purchase of Cooper Industries
Plc, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Today’s  sales  were
the most since $24.6 billion on Nov. 5 and exceed this year’s
daily average of about $6.3 billion.  The offerings are sustaining an unprecedented pace in
dollar-denominated bond sales of $1.3 trillion in 2012, which
already exceeds the  amount issued  in all of 2009 when companies
borrowed a then-record $1.24 trillion. Investors are accepting
almost the lowest yields ever, plowing money into corporate debt
securities with returns that are about three times those of U.S.
equities since June.  “It’s been very favorable right now and there’s been lots
of new issuance,”  William Larkin , a fixed-income  money manager 
at Cabot Money Management Inc. in Salem,  Massachusetts , said in
a telephone interview. “At some point this is going to dry up,
as people become more cautious and the demand starts to fall.”  With six weeks left before year-end, today’s offerings
boosted fourth-quarter dollar issuance to about $233 billion,
beyond the $217 billion of bonds sold in the last three months
of 2011, Bloomberg data show.  Bond Returns  Yields on U.S. corporate bonds from the riskiest to the
safest reached a record-low 3.58 percent on Oct. 19 before
increasing to 3.61 percent yesterday, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. The  extra yield  investors
demand to own corporate bonds rather than government debentures
rose to 243 basis points from 222 basis points on Oct. 18. That
compares with an average of 282 this year.  Company debt in the U.S. has returned 5.4 percent since
June 30 through yesterday, compared with a  1.8 percent gain  in
the same period for the  S&P 500 index (SPX)  of stocks that includes
reinvested dividends.  Investor demand has helped allow corporate treasurers to
pay less to tap debt markets. Barclays, based in  London , issued
the dollar-denominated contingent capital notes as it seeks to
meet regulators’ demands to bolster capital. The bank sold 7.625
percent notes that yield 603.7 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  Eaton Sale  Eaton issued $600 million of 0.95 percent, three-year
debentures to yield 65 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1 billion of 1.5 percent, five-year notes at a
relative yield of 90 basis points, $1.6 billion of 2.75 percent,
10-year securities at 120 basis points, $700 million of 4
percent, 20-year debt at 130 and $1 billion of 4.15 percent, 30-
year bonds at 145, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Other issuers today included  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s
financing arm, which sold $1 billion of 1.6 percent, five-year
notes, and Macy’s Inc., the department-store chain with  $6.7
billion (M)  of bonds outstanding, which issued $750 million of 2.875
percent securities maturing in 2023 and $250 million of 4.3
percent bonds due in 2043. Macy’s will use the debt to help fund
a tender offer announced last month and may use it to refinance
its $298 million of 5.875 percent notes due in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
