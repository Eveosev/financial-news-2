Nouriel Roubini , co-founder of
Roubini Global Economics LLC, said the debt crisis in the euro
area is increasingly affecting the currency bloc’s biggest
economies, Germany and France.  “The economic contraction used to be in the periphery of
the  euro zone ,” Roubini said in a speech in Mainz, Germany,
today. “It is spreading now to the core of the euro zone. For
example, it is quite clear that France is entering a
recession.”  Referring to Germany, the region’s biggest economy, Roubini
said “there is evidence of an economic slowdown” caused by
lower demand for the country’s exports from its euro-area
partners and China. Third-quarter gross domestic product data
for Germany, France and the euro area will be released tomorrow.  Roubini said it is “very positive” for the 17-nation euro
area that the “ European Central Bank  has now taken a more
active role.” The announcement of its unlimited bond-buying
program “significantly reduced” the risk of a breakup of the
common currency, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
