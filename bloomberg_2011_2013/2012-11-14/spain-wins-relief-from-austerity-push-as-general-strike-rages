Europe’s budget enforcers proposed
easing the pressure on  Spain  to cut the deficit, backing further
away from the austerity-first mantra that has dominated the
response to the sovereign-debt crisis.  As a general strike against austerity hobbled Spain’s
industry and transport system, the European Commission said
Spain doesn’t need to compound the budget-cutting pain in 2012
or 2013 and indicated the country would be eligible for a  credit
line  to shore up its public balance sheet.  “Spain has taken effective action,” EU Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  told reporters in
Brussels today. Asked whether Spain meets conditions for aid, he
said: “Spain is on track as regards taking policies that will
help restore its competitiveness and health of public
finances.”  Today’s announcement follows concessions to Greece,
Portugal and Spain itself, in a further shift away from the
fiscal retrenchment that critics say has spread recession across
southern Europe and exacerbated the crisis.  Still, Rehn said “the measures announced so far for 2014
fall short of what is required.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
