British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) ,
the U.K.’s biggest pay-TV provider, said the costs to acquire
broadcast rights to air English Premier League soccer games may
affect margins next year.  BSkyB won the bidding in June to show 116 matches starting
in the 2013-14 season, while  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  won 38 matches. The
sale of the seven packages raised 3.02 billion pounds ($4.8
billion), compared with 1.77 billion pounds in the current pact,
the league said at the time.  “There’s clearly a little bit of discontinuity with the
Premier League,” BSkyB Chief Financial Officer Andrew Griffith
said in Barcelona today at a conference organized by Morgan
Stanley. “There a step uplift next year and then it’s amortized
over the next few years.”  BSkyB, in which  Rupert Murdoch ’s  News Corp. (NWSA)  owns 39
percent, relies on sport broadcasts to lure subscribers while BT
will use the games to start a new sports channel. Griffith said
today the company will also continue to cut customer-service and
back-office expenses to “expand the bottom-line margin.”  BSkyB shares  fell  1.3 percent to close at 753.5 pence in
London, after dropping as much as 1.7 percent earlier today for
the biggest intraday drop since Oct. 24.  BSkyB, based in Isleworth, England, will also focus on
investing in original content for the U.K. and Irish market and
on expanding HBO’s streaming service HBO GO as well as
wholesaling Sky Atlantic, a TV channel that airs programming
from the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
