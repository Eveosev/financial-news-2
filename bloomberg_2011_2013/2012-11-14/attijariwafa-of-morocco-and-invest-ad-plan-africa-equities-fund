Attijariwafa Bank (ATW) , the largest
publicly traded bank in  Morocco , and Invest AD, an Abu Dhabi-
based financial services firm, plan to start a managed fund that
will invest in African equities.  Attijariwafa’s asset management unit, Wafa Gestion, and
Invest AD will jointly provide the initial capital and manage
the fund, according to an agreement signed in Casablanca
yesterday. Financial details weren’t provided.  “Africa’s economic emergence is being driven by rising
incomes and living standards across a broad cross-section of
society and across the continent,” Nazem Al Kudsi, chief
executive officer of Invest AD, said in the statement.  Africa will be the most attractive emerging market for
investment over the next decade, according to a recent survey of
158 global institutional investors by Invest AD and the
Economist Intelligence Unit, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
