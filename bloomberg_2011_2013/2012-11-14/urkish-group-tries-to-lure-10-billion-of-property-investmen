Turkey ’s real estate investment
companies are trying to attract as much as $10 billion a year to
the country’s property market from investors in  Europe , the Gulf
and Asia after rules on foreign ownership were eased.  Members of the Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts, also known as Gyoder, made a presentation in  London ’s
Canary Wharf financial district on Nov. 8 to bankers, asset
managers, real estate brokers and investors. Similar meetings
are planned in Qatar, Singapore and  Malaysia , the group said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The government in May abolished a rule that had banned
citizens of countries where Turks can’t buy real estate from
making property purchases in Turkey. The rule change clears the
way for citizens from about 180 countries to buy property in
Turkey, a more than three-fold increase from the previous total
of 56, Murat Kurum,  Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi
AS (EKGYO) ’s chief executive officer, said at a press conference in
Istanbul today.  Foreign-direct investment in Turkey’s property market is
expected to rise to $10 billion annually from the current $2.5
billion a year, Gyoder said in the statement.  A government ruling this year to demolish and rebuild about
7.5 million houses erected in the wake of an earthquake that
killed about 20,000 people in Turkey’s western Marmara region in
1999, before construction laws were improved, will also open
opportunities for investors and developers, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
