Wheat grain weights, which can
affect flour extraction, were the lowest on record this season
in  Great Britain  after excess rain, the Home-Grown Cereals
Authority said.  Grain weights averaged 69.6 kilograms (153 pounds) a
hectoliter (2.8 bushels), down from last year’s results of 78.7
kilograms a hectoliter, the HGCA, a unit of the Agriculture and
Horticulture Development Board, said today in a  report  on its
website. The figures are based on field surveys that included
99,546 wheat samples. The U.K. had its wettest June, July and
August since 1912, the  Met Office  has said.  The wheat crop’s Hagberg falling number was measured at 237
seconds, the lowest since 2008, and below last year’s level of
269 seconds, the HGCA said. A lower number indicates more of the
grain sprouted, which can affect food shelf life. Protein
content averaged 12.5 percent, the highest since 2006.  “Yields were lower this year, and it is worth considering
that there tends to be an inverse relationship between yields
and protein content,” HGCA said.  Barley grain weights were pegged at 62.9 kilograms per
hectoliter, the lowest on records dating to 1977 and below last
year’s results of 66.4 kilograms per hectoliter, HGCA said. The
barley survey included 36,262 field samples.  To contact the reporter on this story:
