German insurers, including  Allianz
SE (ALV)  and  Talanx AG (TLX) , may post premium growth of 1.5 percent this
year, the  GDV  industry association said.  Premiums are expected to rise to 180.7 billion euros ($230
billion) this year, helped by the strongest property and
casualty growth since 1994, the Berlin-based GDV, which
represents 474 insurers in  Germany , said in a  statement  today.  This is a “satisfying year” for German insurers, given
the challenges from the  European debt crisis , said GDV President
Rolf-Peter Hoenen. While low  interest rates  are weighing on
investments, life insurers are expected to achieve a return of
about 4 percent this year, compared with an average policyholder
guarantee of 3.2 percent for existing policies, GDV said.  “Concerns, that life insurers won’t be able to fulfill
their guarantees in the short- and mid-term are therefore
unfounded,” Hoenen said. “However, it’s undisputed that the
low interest rate environment is a serious challenge for German
insurers.”  Property and casualty insurance premiums are expected to
advance 3.7 percent to 58.7 billion euros this year, the
association said, helped by a projected 5.1 percent increase in
motor insurance to 22 billion euros. Life premiums are expected
to fall 0.7 percent to 86.2 billion euros, while private health-
insurance premiums may rise 3.4 percent to 35.8 billion euros,
GDV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
