Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , the phone
company partly owned by  Carlos Slim ’s America Movil SAB, rose
the most in four years after third-quarter profit beat analysts’
estimates even as revenue declined.  The shares climbed as much as 12 percent, the biggest
intraday advance since November 2008. The stock was up 11
percent at 5.10 euros as of 4:11 p.m. in Vienna, paring Telekom
Austria’s decline to 37 percent since June 15 when Slim’s
company agreed to buy a 21 percent stake.  Net income fell about 23 percent to 99.2 million euros
($126 million), while sales slipped 1.6 percent to 1.09 billion
euros, the Vienna-based company said today in a statement. It
was expected to report profit of 53 million euros and revenue of
1.06 billion euros, according to the average  analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Telekom  Austria ’s third-quarter results were not as bad
as either ourselves or the consensus had feared,” Espirito
Santo Investment Bank said in a research note. “The bulk of the
outperformance was in the Austrian unit.”  For Telekom Austria, which operates in seven eastern
European countries, it was the 15th consecutive quarter that
revenue has declined, according to  data compiled  by Bloomberg.
The last time three-month sales advanced was during the fourth
quarter of 2008, when the company collected 1.3 billion euros
of fees.  ‘Overshadowed Efforts’  “We have worked hard to improve our internal efficiency,”
Chief Executive Officer Hannes Ametsreiter said in the
statement. “The impact from intense competition combined with
an overall challenging economic environment has overshadowed our
efforts.”  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization dropped 0.6 percent in the quarter. Operating
income rose 6.5 percent to 177 million euros.  Telekom Austria has “material upside potential,” Carola Bardelli, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note to
clients. She raised her recommendation on the shares to buy
from hold.  Telekom Austria maintained a forecast for full-year revenue
of about 4.2 billion euros and Ebitda of 1.4 billion euros to
1.45 billion euros. It plans to pay a 5-cent dividend for 2012
and 2013.  Consolidation Gain  The company stands to gain from consolidation in its home
market, where  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  is bidding 1.3 billion
euros to take over Orange, Austria’s No. 3 mobile phone operator
owned by France Telecom SA and Mid Europa Partners. Telekom
Austria is set to pay 390 million euros for 750,000 Orange pre-
paid clients as part of the deal.  Consolidation will raise the value of Telekom Austria
shares, Deutsche Bank’s Bardelli said. European Union and
Austrian regulators are probing the acquisitions and are
expected to rule before the end of the year.  Telekom Austria’s average revenue per user in Austria
slipped almost 9 percent to 18.3 euros, while total sales in its
home market fell about 5 percent to 686 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
