Philippine  government bonds  fell,
snapping an eight-day advance, on speculation the decline in
yields may have been excessive. The peso was little changed.  The yield on the 19-year notes dropped 12 basis points in
the eight days through yesterday and reached 5.57 percent, the
lowest level since Sept. 7. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas cut its
benchmark  interest rate  to 3.5 percent on Oct. 25, the fourth
reduction this year, to spur growth and damp peso appreciation.  “People might be locking in some gains,” said Jan Briace Santos, a fixed-income trader who helps manage the equivalent of
$17 billion at BPI Asset Management Inc. in  Manila . “The sudden
decline in yields in the past few days warrants a correction.”  The yield on the government’s 8 percent bonds due July 2031
increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.605
percent as of 4:17 p.m. in Manila, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services.  The peso was little changed at 41.118 per dollar, compared
with 41.113 yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It has
strengthened 6.5 percent this year. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of  exchange-rate  swings used to price
options, was little changed at 4.70 percent.  The central bank has been “more closely monitoring market
conduct to ensure that movements in the exchange rate are not
excessively volatile,” Governor  Amando Tetangco  wrote in an e-
mailed reply to questions on Nov. 12.  The monetary authority
has “policy space given the current level of interest rates”
and it’s looking at possible refinements in the tools to manage
domestic cash flows, Tetangco wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
