Copper futures fell for the first
time in three days on signs of a deepening slump in Europe and
concern that the so-called fiscal cliff will hinder an economic
recovery in the U.S.  Euro-area industrial production in September dropped the
most in three years, led by double-digit declines in Portugal
and Ireland, data showed today. President  Barack Obama  is
negotiating to reach a deficit-reduction deal with Congress to
avert $607 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts.  “There was some not-very-good data out of the euro zone,
and markets are going to have a tough time until this fiscal
cliff is resolved,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “I can’t
imagine there will be a whole lot of upside until there’s a
resolution.”  Copper futures for March delivery declined 0.5 percent to
settle at $3.465 a pound at 1:12 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The contract rose 0.8 percent in the previous two days.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 0.5 percent to $7,640 a metric ton ($3.47 a pound).
Aluminum dropped, while zinc, nickel, lead and tin gained.  To contact the reporters on this story:
