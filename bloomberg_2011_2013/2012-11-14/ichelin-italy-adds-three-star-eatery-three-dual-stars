Michelin today awarded a third star
to Piazza Duomo in Alba and added three dual-star restaurants to
its guide to  Italy .  Piazza Duomo’s chef “proposes highly creative, top quality
dishes, deeply rooted in the local tradition,” Michelin said in
an e-mailed release. “In all, seven restaurants have now earned
the three-star distinction.”  The new two-star venues were Antica Osteria Cera, in
Campagna Lupia, Lughetto, specialized in raw saltwater fish;
Agli Amici, in Udine; and La Trota, in Rivodutri. Ten new
restaurants earned their first star.  Lombardy is the region with the most starred restaurants.
It has 56 of them, followed by Piedmont with 38 and Campania
with 32.  Three stars mean exceptional cuisine, worth a special
journey; two stars are for excellent cooking, worth a detour;
one star denotes a very good restaurant in its category.  Michelin & Cie. (ML)  is the world’s  second-biggest tiremaker 
after Bridgestone Corp. It produced its first guide in August
1900, distributed free of charge (until 1920) and originally
intended for chauffeurs.  The guide contained practical information, including street
maps and tips on using and repairing tires.  To contact the writer on the story:
