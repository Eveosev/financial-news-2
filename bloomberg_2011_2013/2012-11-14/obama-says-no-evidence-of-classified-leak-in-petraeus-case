President  Barack Obama  said he has
seen no evidence that classified information was disclosed as a
result of the extramarital affair that led to the resignation of
ex-CIA Director David H. Petraeus.  Obama, at a White House news conference, said he hasn’t
seen anything “that in any way” would compromise U.S. national
security.  It was Obama’s first news conference since his Nov. 6
reelection and Petraeus’s resignation Nov. 9.  The Central Intelligence Agency director resigned after the
FBI discovered he had an extramarital affair with his
biographer, Paula Broadwell.  Petraeus’s resignation, and a related investigation of
Marine General John Allen, the president’s now on-hold nominee
to be NATO’s top commander, complicates Obama’s task as he
prepares to overhaul his Cabinet for his second term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
