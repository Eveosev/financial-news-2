United Nations carbon offsets for
December and for 2013 fell to records after the European Union
said it wouldn’t hold back supply of EU permits until it
receives approval for its glut-fix plan.  UN carbon credits for December fell as much as 22 percent
to 60 euro cents a ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange,
the lowest since the contract began trading in 2008. UN offsets
for 2013 dropped 15 percent to 91 cents a ton, also the lowest
since the contract was introduced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
