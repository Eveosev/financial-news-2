The U.S. “strongly” condemns
rocket attacks from the  Gaza Strip  that target  Israel , according
to a statement released today by the State Department.  “We stongly condemn the barrage of rocket fire from Gaza
into southern Israel,” the statement said. It was released a
few hours after Israeli jets began striking targets in Gaza. The
Israeli operation in Gaza was conducted in response to continued
rocket fire, Israeli officials said, and included a so-called
“surgical strike” that killed senior Hamas figure, Ahmed al-
Jabari. Hamas is considered a terrorist group by the U.S. and
Israel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
