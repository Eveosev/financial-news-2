Soybean futures gained the most in a
week after an industry report showed increased demand from
makers of  animal feed  and cooking oil. Corn rose for a second
day, while wheat declined.  Processors in October used 153.536 million bushels of
soybeans, up 8.8 percent from a year earlier and the most since
January 2010, the National Oilseed Processors Association said
today. Exports of animal feed doubled from a year earlier, the
trade group said. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  reported
sales of 120,000 metric tons of soybeans to China and 40,000
tons of  soybean oil  to unknown destinations.  “The crush report today was bullish, adding to a lack of
evidence of usage rationing,”  Anne Frick , the senior oilseed
analyst for Jefferies Bache LLC in New York, said in a note to
clients. Consumption would need to drop by at least 279 million
bushels from year-earlier levels during the next 10 months to
maintain adequate reserves before the 2013 harvest, she said.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 0.8 percent to
close at $14.19 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since Nov. 6. The oilseed yesterday
touched $13.9125, the lowest since June, after reaching a record
$17.89 in September.  Corn futures for March delivery gained 0.4 percent to
$7.2925 a bushel on the CBOT. Prices still are down 14 percent
from a record $8.49 on Aug. 10 as demand slowed.  Wheat futures for March delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
$8.64 a bushel in Chicago, capping a four-session decline for
the contract of 5.7 percent.  The U.S. was the largest exporter of all three commodities
last year. Corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
