President  Barack Obama  said the U.S.
isn’t ready to recognize a new Syrian opposition coalition as a
government in exile.  Obama said at a White House news conference today that the
U.S. will be meeting with the opposition group, which was
announced Nov. 11 after talks  with Qatar.  Still, he said he wasn’t yet willing to join French
President  Francois Hollande , who announced yesterday that France
recognizes the newly formed Syrian National Coalition as the
legitimate representative of the Syrian people.  Earlier today, Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  called
for more pressure on Syria and announced $30 million in
humanitarian aid to those affected by the 20-month uprising
against President Bashar al-Assad that has killed thousands.  The upheaval has threatened to spill over to neighboring
Turkey and Israel and to destabilize Lebanon and Jordan.  Syrian jets bombed a rebel-held town near the border with
Turkey for a third day. Turkey, a NATO member, has warned that
it will respond to any violation of its airspace. Israel has
vowed to defend its borders as well.  To contact the reporters on this story:
