Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rose, sending the yield to a two-month low, on speculation banks
bought the notes amid a slowdown in credit growth. The dong was
steady.  The value of outstanding loans in Vietnam may grow 5
percent this year, Central Bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh said in
a televised address to the National Assembly in Hanoi yesterday,
lagging behind a 14.4 percent increase in 2011, according to
government data. Banks have bought 183 trillion dong ($8.87
billion) of government bonds this year, “a lot more” than in
previous years, Binh said.  The yield on the benchmark notes fell eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 9.90 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest
one-day drop since July 20 and the lowest level since Sept. 14.  “Credit growth is still low, and that’s giving support to
the downward trend in yields,” said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-
based bond trader at Bank for Investment & Development of
Vietnam. “Most banks have a lot of money and don’t want to lend
it, so they buy bonds. Yields are still good.”  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 2:00 p.m. in
 Hanoi , unchanged from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The State Bank of Vietnam set its reference rate at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
