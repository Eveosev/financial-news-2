European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  will make a statement on  Spain 
this afternoon, his office said.  “Rehn will make a statement on Spain in the Berlaymont’s
VIP Corner at 4:15 p.m.” local time in Brussels, Rehn’s office
said in a statement without giving any further details.  At a meeting of euro-area finance ministers in Brussels on
Nov. 13, Rehn said a proposal on Spain will be presented
“shortly.” The country is “working hard” to meet its fiscal
targets, he said.  “Spain is in the process of substantiating its fiscal
consolidation measures in the next two years,” Rehn told
reporters at the Brussels meeting. “We will focus on the
structural sustainability of public finances over the medium
term. That means structural effort, not only the nominal
target.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
