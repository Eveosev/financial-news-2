Investors yanked a record volume of
cash from  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s  exchange-traded fund  that buys  junk
bonds  as the notes lose value for the first month since May.  The $16.3 billion fund reported an  outflow  of 2.4 million
shares yesterday, equal to about $218.9 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest daily withdrawal
in the five-year history of the iShares iBoxx High Yield
Corporate Bond Fund, the largest of its kind.  The five largest junk-bond ETFs, which allow investors to
speculate on the securities without actually owning them, have
lost $1.97 billion of assets since Sept. 20 as investors wager
that a four-year rally in the debt is running out of steam.
High-yield bonds in the U.S. are losing 0.14 percent this month
after posting 12.9 percent returns this year through October,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  BlackRock’s ETF has lost 1.2 percent since Sept. 20, when
the amount of its assets reached a high of $17.4 billion,
Bloomberg data show. Its shares fell as much as 0.1 percent
today after a 0.2 percent decline yesterday, trading at $91.18
