Sales of ship fuel in Singapore, the
world’s biggest market for so-called bunker, rebounded from the
lowest level in seven months on seasonal demand.  Bunker sales  rose 5.5 percent to 3.51 million metric tons
in October from 3.33 million tons in September, which was the
lowest volume since February, the city-state’s Maritime and Port
Authority said today in a  statement  on its website. October
volume fell from 3.55 million tons a year earlier and was the
third lowest this year.  “The market is still weak at this moment,” said Simon Neo,
an executive director of Piroj International LLP, a Singapore-
based bunker broker. “November and December volumes will be
rather flat from current levels, as I don’t see much improvement
in the economy.”  October volume gained from September because of busier
shipping activity before the Christmas and New Year holidays,
according to Neo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
