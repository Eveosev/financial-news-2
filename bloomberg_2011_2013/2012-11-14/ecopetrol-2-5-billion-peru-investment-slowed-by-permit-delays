Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ’s $2.5 billion Peru
investment plans are being held up by government permit delays,
hindering the company’s plans to triple crude production in the
Andean nation.  Peru’s government hasn’t authorized Colombia’s state oil
company and partner  Repsol SA (REP)  to start exploration work at four
northern jungle oil blocks they won in a bid round in October
2010, Carlos Rendon, Ecopetrol’s country manager in Peru, said
in an interview today.  “The company is looking to accelerate development of our
areas,” Rendon said on the sidelines of the BNamericas Southern
Cone Energy Summit in  Lima . “But the reality in Peru is
different from Colombia in terms of permits.”  Ecopetrol, based in Bogota, plans to triple production in
Peru to 50,000 barrels a day by 2016, which would make it the
nation’s largest crude producer ahead of Pluspetrol SA of
Argentina and Brazil’s  Petroleo Brasileiro SA. (PETR4)  Peru has lined up
$23 billion in energy investments during the next decade,
according to state oil contracting agency Perupetro.  Ecopetrol fell 0.4 percent to 5,140 pesos in Bogota. The
stock has climbed 23 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
