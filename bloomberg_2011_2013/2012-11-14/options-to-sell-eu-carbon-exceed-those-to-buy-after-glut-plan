The volume of options to sell
December European Union carbon allowances exceeded those to buy
yesterday, after the regulator proposed Nov. 12 to temporarily
delay 900 million metric tons of supply to fix a glut.  Traders yesterday bought and sold 4.2 million tons of
options to sell, with strike prices ranging from 6 euros ($7.64)
a ton to 8.50 euros a ton, according to data on cleared trades
from ICE Futures  Europe  in London. Today, 250,000 tons of put
options changed hands at a strike of 8 euros.  There were options to buy 2.1 million tons yesterday at
strikes from 9 euros a ton to 12 euros, the ICE data show.
Today, options to buy 250,000 at 9 euros changed hands. Trades
handled by brokers are often cleared on ICE.  December futures have advanced 41 percent since reaching a
record low in April, as the European Commission in Brussels
seeks to fix a glut in supply.  The December carbon contract rose 0.5 percent today to 8.45
euros a ton on ICE at 9:46 a.m. It plunged 7.4 percent yesterday
after surging 9 percent the day earlier, ahead of publication of
the commissionâ€™s proposal.  Certified Emission Reductions for December gained 3 cents
to 80 euro cents a ton today. CERs for December next year
plunged 23 percent yesterday to a record 1.07 euros a ton and
had not traded as of 9:46 a.m. today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
