RWE AG (RWE) , Germany second-largest
utility, cut losses in its trading and gas unit by more than
half and said the outlook is improving.  The power producer’s trading and gas midstream arm lost 403
million euros ($514 million) on an earnings before interest and
tax basis in the first nine months of the year, the Essen,
Germany-based RWE said today in its earnings report. That
compares with a loss of 842 million euros in the same period
last year.  “A marked improvement of the performance of our energy
trading activities was contrasted by ongoing heavy burdens in
the gas midstream business,” RWE said. “Parts of our gas
purchases are based on long-term, oil price-indexed contracts,
and we have to pay prices for this gas that are much higher than
those realizable when it is sold on the market.”  RWE forecasts the unit to produce a full-year result
significantly above last year’s operating loss of 800 million
euros, it said. The company in August forecast the unit to
produce a full-year result “in the order of last year’s,” it
said on Aug. 14.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
