Mosaic Co. (MOS) , the largest U.S.
fertilizer producer, may further reduce its output of potash
amid lower-than-expected global demand for the crop nutrient,
Chief Financial Officer Larry Stranghoener said.  “We will continue to match production with demand, which
may require us to further lower our operating rates,”
Stranghoener said at an investor presentation in  New York  today.
Mosaic, based in Plymouth,  Minnesota , yesterday cut its fiscal
second-quarter forecast for potash and phosphate shipments as
international buyers delay purchases.  The company said yesterday it expects to ship 1.3 million
to 1.4 million metric tons of potash in the quarter ending this
month, down from an Oct. 2 forecast of 1.6 million to 1.9
million. Delays in signing contracts in China and  India  have
spurred other buyers to postpone their purchases because they
expect prices for crop nutrients to decline, Mosaic said.  Mosaic also reduced its projection for phosphate shipments
to 2.9 million to 3.1 million tons, from 3 million to 3.4
million previously.  Mosaic  fell  3.3 percent to $49.10 at the close in New York,
the biggest decline since Oct. 2. The shares have declined 2.6
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
