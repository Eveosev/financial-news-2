A proposed delay of 900 million
European Union carbon permits at auctions starting next year
should lead to a more gradual build-up of surplus in the market
and reduce the risk of price volatility, the EU said.  The European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory arm, also
considered scenarios in which it postponed auctions of 1.2
billion or 400 million allowances, it said in a document
published in Brussels today. The commission has also published a
report on long-term options to strengthen the carbon market.  While the first would increase the risk of “significant
upward pressure” at the start of the next trading period
starting in 2013 and a corresponding decline later, the second
would fail to sufficiently rebalance supply and demand at the
start of the next phase, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
