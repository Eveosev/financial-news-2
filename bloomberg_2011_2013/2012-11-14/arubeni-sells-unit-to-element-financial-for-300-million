Marubeni Corp. (8002) ,  Japan ’s biggest
trader of agricultural commodities, sold its U.S.-based CoActiv
Capital Partners Inc. unit to leasing company  Element Financial
Corp. (EFN)  as it seeks to lower debt levels.  Element, based in Toronto,  Canada , agreed to pay $300
million for all of Horsham, Pennsylvania-based CoActive Capital
and assume the equipment leasing unit’s debt, Marubeni said
today in a statement on its website.  Marubeni is selling some assets and may cut capital
expenses to lower the Tokyo-based company’s debt to equity ratio
to 1.8 points, Chief Financial Officer Yukihiko Matsumura said
on Nov. 1. Marubeni’s debt to equity ratio increased by 0.09
points to 2.01 as of Sept. 30, compared with six months earlier.
Marubeni has agreed to buy U.S. grain trader Gavilon Group LLC
for $5.6 billion including debt, a deal which has yet to close.  The Japanese company’s credit-default swaps, used by
investors as insurance against default on bonds, rose to 295
points in May, the most in six months, after the Gavilon
purchase was announced. The swaps have declined to 189 points as
of yesterday, the latest data available to Bloomberg.  Marubeni was the only one of six major Japanese trading
houses to post a profit increase in the six months ending Sept.
30. Chief Executive Officer Teruo Asada said Nov. 6 that he was
confident the company will meet its 200 billion yen annual
profit goal and also lower debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
