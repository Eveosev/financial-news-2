(Corrects location of Burger King in second paragraph.)  Tiger Global Management LLC, the $8
billion hedge fund run by Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan, added
new positions in  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  and Burger King Worldwide Inc. last
quarter and increased its stake in  Facebook (FB)  Inc.  The New York-based fund bought 25 million shares in
Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo, a stake valued at $399
million at the end of September, according to a filing with
Securities and Exchange Commission today. The firm also bought
7.2 million shares of Miami-based Burger King, a position worth
$100 million, making it the company’s third-biggest shareholder.  Coleman, who previously worked for hedge-fund legend  Julian
Robertson  before starting his own fund in 2000, is known
primarily for his technology investments. He was an early
investor in Facebook and Russian Web portal Mail.ru Group Ltd.
before they went public.  Tiger Global added 9.8 million shares in Menlo Park,
 California-based Facebook , bringing its total position to 11.8
million shares. The world’s largest social network has lost more
than 40 percent of its market value since going public in May at
a price of $38 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
