AB Ukio Bankas (UKB1L)  rose for the first
time in a week after the chairman of  Lithuania ’s biggest listed
bank by assets said it was protected from losses on the value of
property taken over from debtors.  The shares rose 4.2 percent from an eight-year low to 0.124
euros ($0.158) in Vilnius for the biggest gain since March 26,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Volume of 237,307
shares was just below the 12-month daily average.  Chairman Arnas Zalys said the bank had guarantees on the
valuation of a property developer it took over last week from
several borrowers, who would be required to pay compensation if
the true value turned out to be less. The shares lost a quarter
of their value in a week as analysts, including Swedbank’s Mart Kroodo, said they were concerned about the size and nature of
the deal, and the accuracy of the developer’s valuation.  The move to take ownership of UAB Zalgirio Sporto Arena,
valued at 357 million litai ($131 million), shows that the bank
“is starting to work actively with its portfolio of borrowers,
seeking to improve its efficiency in resolving problem debts,”
Zalys said in remarks to Bloomberg published late yesterday.
“Such steps are painful in the short run, but they are
essential.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
