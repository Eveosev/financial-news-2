Aiful Corp. (8515)  surged to a three-year
high in  Tokyo  trading after the Japanese consumer lender posted
an increase in first-half profit.  The  shares  gained 30 percent, the most in 21 months, to 312
yen at the close. Net income climbed 76 percent for the six
months ended Sept. 30 from a year earlier to 19.6 billion yen
($247 million), the Kyoto-based company said yesterday.  “Their earnings had a positive impact on the market,”
said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees $600 million in assets at
Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.  Aiful and bigger rival  Acom Co. (8572)  are withstanding a
regulatory crackdown that forced consumer-finance companies to
pare loans and lower interest rates. Acom, whose biggest
shareholder is Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., last week
posted first-half net income of 27.2 billion yen, the Tokyo-
based company’s second semiannual profit in three years.  Aiful was the day’s biggest gainer in the benchmark  Topix
Index (TPX) , which slipped 0.02 percent. The stock has almost tripled
this year, the fourth-best performance on the Topix.  To contact the reporter on this story:
