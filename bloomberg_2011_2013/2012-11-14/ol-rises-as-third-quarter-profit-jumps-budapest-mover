Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,  Hungary ’s largest
refiner, rose for a second day after net income jumped 86
percent in the third quarter, exceeding analysts’ estimates.  The shares gained as much as 0.8 percent and traded 0.4
percent higher at 18,800 forint by 11:19 a.m. in Budapest. The
benchmark BUX stock  index , in which Mol has the biggest
weighting at 33 percent, was 0.5 percent higher.  Net income rose to 67.5 billion forint ($301 million) from
36.4 billion forint a year earlier, the company said in a filing
to the Budapest Stock Exchange today. The median estimate of
five analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for a profit of 53.1
billion forint. Mol expects “average”  profitability in the
last quarter of 2012 in the downstream segment which boosted
income in the July through September period, Chief Financial
Officer Jozsef Simola said in a conference call today.  “The slightly positive trends may help raise earnings
expectations,” Balint Torok, a Budapest-based analyst at Buda-
Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in a research report today. “The
impact may only be small.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
