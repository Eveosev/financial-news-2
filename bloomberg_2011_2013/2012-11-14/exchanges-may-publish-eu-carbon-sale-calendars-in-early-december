The  ICE Futures Europe (ICE)  exchange and
the European Energy Exchange AG, which host carbon auctions for
European Union governments, may publish schedules for 2013 sales
by early December, the EUâ€™s regulatory arm said.  The initial calendar will not take into account the amount
of permits to be delayed under an EU draft measure presented on
Monday, the European Commission said in a document published in
Brussels today. The regulator proposed Nov. 12 to postpone sales
of 900 million of carbon allowances from 2013 through 2015.  ICE and EEX will update their calendars to take account of
the delayed permits after the EU adopts the backloading measure,
reducing the volume for the remainder of the year, the 
commission said in the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
