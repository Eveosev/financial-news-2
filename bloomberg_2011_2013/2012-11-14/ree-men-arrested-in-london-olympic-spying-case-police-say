Three men were arrested by U.K.
police as part of an investigation into allegations that private
detectives hired by Tottenham soccer club spied on the
organizers of the 2012 Olympics and West Ham United.  Richard Forrest, 30, of Crawley outside  London , and Lee
Stewart, 39, of the London suburb of Esher, were each charged
with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and will appear in
court on Nov. 28, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Met Police.  Howard Hill, 58, of Stockport, was charged with two counts
of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation, one with
Forrest and one with Stewart.  Last November, Margaret Ford, chairwoman of the OPLC, told
the  London Assembly  that Tottenham monitored all members of the
committee. Spurs were trying to win rights to use the Olympic
stadium after this year’s Games, while the OPLC awarded the site
to West Ham and Newham borough. Tottenham has denied that it
spied on the board.  The U.K. government had agreed to sell the facility to the
east London team and Newham after the Games. An anonymous
complaint to the European Commission and north London rival
soccer club Tottenham’s challenge in U.K. courts delayed the
process.  The government in September 2011 said it will retain
ownership of the facility after legal challenges. The OPLC is
looking for tenants for the 537 million-pound ($863 million)
facility, and West Ham has said it may try to rent the stadium.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
