German  home prices  in some regions
may be in danger of overheating, while the risk of excessive
pricing across the country is still low, the Bundesbank said.  Banks are increasing their lending as demand for
residential property accelerates, fuelled in part by low
 interest rates  and a lack of alternative investments, the German
central bank said in its 2012 Financial Stability Review today.  “The risk for price exaggerations for Germany overall
remains low from today’s perspective,” the Bundesbank said.
“However, it can’t be ruled out in regional sub-markets.”  German residential property is attracting investors seeking
a safe investment amid the European sovereign-debt crisis. Low
interest rates reduce profitable investment options for large
institutions that typically buy bonds and are encouraging
private buyers to take out  mortgage loans .  Investors bought 6.4 billion euros ($8.2 billion) of German
residential property in the first half, more than the 5.8
billion euros that was spent in all of 2011, according to data
compiled by Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
