Eaton Corp. (ETN) , the equipment maker
that is acquiring  Cooper Industries Plc (CBE) , sold $4.9 billion of
bonds in five parts to help fund the purchase.  Eaton issued $600 million of 0.95 percent, three-year
debentures to yield 65 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1 billion of 1.5 percent, five-year notes at a
relative yield of 90 basis points, $1.6 billion of 2.75 percent,
10-year securities at 120 basis points, $700 million of 4
percent, 20-year debt at 130 and $1 billion of 4.15 percent, 30-
year bonds at 145, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The three-year portion was added after the initial offering
earlier today, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly.  The company agreed to buy Cooper, a maker of electric-
distribution equipment, in May for $11.8 billion. If the
purchase is not completed by May 21, 2013, the bonds will be
redeemed at 101 cents on the dollar, the company said today in a
statement.  The systems manufacturer last sold debt in June 2011,
issuing $300 million of floating-rate three-year debentures to
yield 33 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate, Bloomberg data show.  The new bonds were issued through Turlock Corp. and are
rated Baa1 by Moodyâ€™s Investors Service, the ratings company
said today in a statement.  Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley managed the sale for the
Cleveland-based company, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
