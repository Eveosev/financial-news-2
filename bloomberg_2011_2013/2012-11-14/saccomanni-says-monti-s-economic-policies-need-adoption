Bank of Italy Director General
Fabrizio Saccomanni said Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s policies
overhauling Italy’s economy need to be fully adopted in order to
spur growth in the euro region’s third-biggest economy.  “The reforms approved by Parliament need to be fully and
tangibly implemented,” Saccomanni said at an event in Rome
today. “Italy can only pursue the reform program it started.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
