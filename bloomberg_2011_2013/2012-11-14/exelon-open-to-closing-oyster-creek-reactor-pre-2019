Exelon Corp. (EXC) , the largest U.S.
nuclear plant operator, would consider closing its Oyster Creek
station before the plant’s planned 2019 decommissioning, Chief
Executive Officer Christopher Crane said.  Exelon would accelerate plans to close Oyster Creek in
Forked River,  New Jersey , if it faced unexpected new  capital
costs  at a time when depressed power prices and cheap renewable
energy are squeezing nuclear generation margins, Crane said in
an interview yesterday.  Exelon already has deferred plans to boost capacity at its
LaSalle nuclear station in northern Illinois and Limerick plant
in Pennsylvania, saving $1.2 billion in the near-term, the chief
executive said.  The Chicago-based company also plans to refuel its Clinton
nuclear plant annually instead of every two years in a bid to
boost profitability at the hardest-hit plant in Exelon’s 17-
reactor system, he said.  “That’s a core expense to the company, but hopefully we
can keep the plant open longer as we navigate through this
issue,” Crane said.  Exelon hasn’t yet considered decommissioning the 1,043-
megawatt Clinton, Illinois, station, which is among the youngest
in its portfolio, he said. The plant’s economics have been hurt
by a glut of cheap  wind energy  in Illinois.  To contact the reporter on this story:
