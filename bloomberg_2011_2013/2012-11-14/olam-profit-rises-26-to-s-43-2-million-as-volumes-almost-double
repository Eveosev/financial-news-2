Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , the food
commodities supplier part owned by  Singapore ’s Temasek Holdings
Pte, said first-quarter profit gained 26 percent as sales
volumes almost doubled.  Net income  was S$43.2 million ($35.3 million) in the three
months ended Sept. 30, from S$34.2 million a year ago,
Singapore-based Olam said today in a statement. That compares
with the S$27.6 million average estimate of four analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Revenue increased 45 percent to
S$4.69 billion.  Sales by volume jumped 98 percent in the quarter driven by
an increase in grains, Olam said. Today’s result also included
an operational gain of S$10.1 million because of “fair
valuation of biological assets,” that the company began in the
third quarter of last year and didn’t do in the corresponding
first quarter, Olam said.  Olam fell 4.4 percent to S$1.76 in Singapore, the lowest
since July 25. The result was announced after the close of
trade. The stock has lost 17 percent this year, making it the
third-worst performer on the benchmark Straits Times Index.  The first quarter normally accounts for only 5 percent to
10 percent of the company’s full-year  profit  due to seasonality
of agricultural products, Olam said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
