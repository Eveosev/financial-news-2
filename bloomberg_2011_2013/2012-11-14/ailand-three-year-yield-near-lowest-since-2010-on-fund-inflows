Thailand’s three-year government
bond yield was near a two-year low after international investors
added holdings amid speculation the central bank will keep
borrowing costs low this year. The baht held steady.  Global funds  bought  $133 million more sovereign notes than
they sold in the first two days of this week, while cutting
holdings of local stocks by a net $150 million, data from the
Thai Bond Market Association and stock exchange show. Inflation
slowed to 3.32 percent in October from 3.38 percent the previous
month, according to a Nov. 1 official report. The Bank of
Thailand, which cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter
percentage point to 2.75 percent on Oct. 17, next reviews
monetary policy on Nov. 28 .  “Thai bonds are supported by fund inflows from overseas as
inflation was lower than expected and rates are expected to stay
low,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at Societe Generale SA
in Hong Kong. “Also, there’s a possible asset allocation shift
out of Thai equities into bonds.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due May 2015 was
unchanged at 2.87 percent as of 8:40 a.m. in Bangkok,  according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate reached 2.83 percent on
Nov. 7, the lowest level in two years.  The Bank of  Thailand  cut its 2013 growth forecast to 4.6
percent from its earlier projection of 5 percent on Oct. 26. The
monetary authority also reduced its inflation estimate for next
year to 2.8 percent from 3.4 percent.  The baht was steady at 30.68 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
4.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
