Honeywell International Inc. (HON) ’s
aerospace unit plans to double its number of engineers in  China 
over five years as the nation works to create a globally
competitive planemaking industry.  The partsmaker will boost its workforce by recruiting
locally and moving some experienced personnel to the country,
Briand Greer, its Asia-Pacific aerospace president, said today
in a Zhuhai airshow interview. The company currently has about
350 engineers in China among a local workforce of about 1,200.  The new engineers will help with programs that Honeywell is
working on with Chinese aerospace companies, including
Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, the nation’s challenger to
Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS. Morris Township, New Jersey-based
Honeywell is working on four systems for Comac’s planned C919
aircraft including flight controls and auxiliary power units.  The company is also talking with  Aviation Industry Corp. of
China , the nation’s biggest aerospace company, about jointly
developing a business-jet engine, Greer said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
