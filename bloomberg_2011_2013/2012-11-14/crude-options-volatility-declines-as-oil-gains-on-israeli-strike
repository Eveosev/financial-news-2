Crude oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures rose after  Israel  killed a Hamas militant
leader in an air strike today.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.96 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 2:35 p.m., down from 30.5 percent
yesterday.  “You’re seeing a little slippage in volatility because of
the higher price,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  January-delivery crude oil rose 91 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to settle at $86.75 a barrel on the Nymex.  Prices rose after Israeli jets struck the  Gaza Strip  today,
killing the leader of Hamas’s military wing, as the army pledged
the use of ground troops if required to end attacks on Israel’s
citizens.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $105 calls, which rose 6 cents to 19 cents a barrel on
volume of 13,955 lots at 2:40 p.m. January $115 calls were the
second-most active, with 3,531 lots exchanged as they increased
3 cents to 9 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would rise, or calls, accounted for 74
percent of the 59,966 lots traded.  Exchange Data  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
