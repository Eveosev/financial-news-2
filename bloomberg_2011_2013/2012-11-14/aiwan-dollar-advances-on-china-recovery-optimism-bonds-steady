Taiwan  dollar forwards rose,
approaching a 14-month high, on speculation exports will pick up
as  China ’s economy improves. Government bonds were steady.  Exports from China, the world’s second-largest economy,
increased 11.6 percent in October from a year earlier, the most
since May, data showed Nov. 10. Taiwan’s central bank denied
imposing new foreign exchange rules, it said a statement today.
The monetary authority this week started requiring lenders to
prove demand stems from trade and investment purposes before the
island’s currency can be bought using U.S. dollars, according to
two traders who asked not to be identified in keeping with their
companies’ policies.  “The appreciation is reflecting investors are optimistic
about the outlook for recovery in the region,” said Ma Tieying,
an economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in  Singapore . “Taiwan’s
central bank is still more cautious on the currency’s gains.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the Taiwan dollar
gained 0.1 percent to NT$28.89 versus the greenback as of 4:30
p.m. in Taipei, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts touched NT$28.823 on Nov. 12, the strongest level
since Aug. 24, 2011. The forwards were at a 0.8 percent premium
to the spot rate, which closed little changed at NT$29.125,
based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices.  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 was steady at 1.118 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The overnight  interbank lending rate  was also
little changed at 0.386 percent, a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  -- Editors: Andrew Janes, Amit Prakash  To contact the reporters on this story:
