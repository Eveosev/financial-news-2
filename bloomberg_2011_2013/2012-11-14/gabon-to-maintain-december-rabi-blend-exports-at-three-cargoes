Gabonâ€™s exports of its Rabi Blend
crude for December will be unchanged from November at three
cargoes, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The West African nation will load two shipments of Rabi
Light, one less than November, according to a separate plan. All
consignments are for 650,000 barrels each.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  operates the Rabi Blend field, while
 Total SA (FP)  runs the Rabi Light site.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
