South African corn reached the
highest in three days as the rand weakened against the dollar,
making imports more expensive. Prices in the U.S. rose.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, increased 0.9 percent, the highest since Nov. 9, to
2,440.20 rand ($276) a metric ton by the midday close in
Johannesburg. The yellow variety gained 0.7 percent to 2,486
rand a ton.  The rand declined 0.4 percent to 8.8302 a dollar as of
12:50 p.m. A weaker rand increases the price of imported grains.
Corn rose 0.5 percent to $7.27 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  “The rand weakened against the dollar, so our prices will
go up,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader at Trademar Futures (Pty)
Ltd., said by phone in Johannesburg. Also, the Chicago prices
went up and we are following them.’’  South Africa is the continent’s largest corn producer. Meal
made from the white variety is one of the country’s staple foods
while yellow corn is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in December rose 0.1 percent to 3,685
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
