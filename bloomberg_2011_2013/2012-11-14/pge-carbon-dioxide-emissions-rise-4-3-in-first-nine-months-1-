PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s largest utility,
emitted 4.3 percent more carbon dioxide in the first nine months
as power output increased after a new lignite-fired unit was
commissioned last year.  The company emitted 45.9 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide, up 1.9 million tons from last year, and that compared
with an average annual European Union carbon permit quota of 57
million tons allocated free of charge from 2008 through 2012,
the Warsaw-based company said today. The EU’s system is the
world’s largest cap-and-trade program, in which companies must
surrender freely allocated or purchased permits matching their
greenhouse-gas emissions every year.  PGE’s Elektrownia Belchatow, the EU’s most-polluting plant,
emitted 26.8 million tons of carbon dioxide in the first half,
or 15 percent more than last year, as a new 858-megawatt unit
began generating electricity.  EU permits for December increased 0.4 percent to 8.44 euros
($10.75) a ton as of 7:54 a.m. on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
