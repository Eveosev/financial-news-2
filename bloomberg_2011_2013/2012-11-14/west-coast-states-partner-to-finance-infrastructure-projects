A partnership among  California ,
Oregon, Washington and Canada’s British Columbia may use state-
issued debt to develop shared infrastructure projects, Oregon
Governor John Kitzhaber said.  The West Coast Infrastructure Exchange, which will seek
private investment to replace aging public works and develop new
ones, may use debt to pay for shared projects, Kitzhaber said
today at a news briefing in San Francisco.  “You could argue that Oregon debt capacity is funding
projects in California, but California is funding projects in
Oregon,” Kitzhaber said. “We need to move beyond the old
political lens that each state will happen all by itself and
recognize that increasingly our problems are regional.”  The exchange is aimed at about $1 trillion in
infrastructure investment needs over the next 30 years.
Officials at today’s announcement included Oregon Treasurer Ted Wheeler and California Treasurer Bill Lockyer.  Kitzhaber said specific projects haven’t been identified.
He said he expected they will include water, electric
transmission and grid issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
