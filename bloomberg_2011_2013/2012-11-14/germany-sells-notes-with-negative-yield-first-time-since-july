Germany  sold two-year notes at a
negative yield for the second time on record, with the Federal
Finance Agency saying the debate over Greece’s fiscal
sustainability boosted demand for the securities.  The nation auctioned 4.3 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of
the debt at an  average yield  of minus 0.02 percent, down from
0.07 percent when similar-maturity debt was offered on Oct. 17,
according to a statement from the Bundesbank today. It’s the
first time since July the rate has been below zero. A negative
yield means investors who hold the security until it matures
will receive less than they paid to buy it.  The result underlines investors’ “nervousness and search
for safety amid risks that persist from  Greece ’s unresolved
troubles and the impending fiscal cliff in the U.S.,” finance
agency spokesman Joerg Mueller said in an interview after the
auction. The so-called fiscal cliff refers to a combined $607
billion of tax increases and spending cuts that will begin
automatically in January without a change to U.S. legislation.  Germany got bids for 8.4 billion euros of the notes sold
today, versus a maximum sales target of 5 billion euros,
according to the Bundesbank statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
