The three Lithuanian parties seeking
presidential approval to form a government agreed to add
Lithuanian Polish Election Action to their proposed coalition,
 Baltic News Service  reported, citing Social Democrat leader
Algirdas Butkevicius.  That would give the coalition, which currently includes the
Social Democrats, the Labor Party and Order & Justice, at least
85 seats in the 141-member Parliament in the capital, Vilnius,
BNS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
