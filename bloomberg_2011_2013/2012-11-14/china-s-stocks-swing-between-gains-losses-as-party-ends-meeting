China’s stocks  climbed, led by
material producers, after the ruling party’s once-in-a-decade
meeting to choose new leaders drew to a close and the yuan rose
to a 19-year high.  Nanzhi Co. (600163)  led a rally among paper makers as a stronger
Chinese currency reduces costs from importing pulp. Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd. jumped the most in two months after the
China Securities Journal said the government will start buying
aluminum to add to reserves.  China International Travel Service
Corp. (601888) , the largest tourism company by market value, tumbled by
the 10 percent daily limit on a plan to sell new shares.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.4 percent to 2,055.42
at the close. The CSI 300 Index added 0.5 percent to 2,223.11.
Vice President  Xi Jinping  and Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  were re-
appointed to the Communist Party’s central committee today,
while members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the top
decision-making body, will be elected tomorrow in Beijing.  “The conclusion of the party congress removes some
political uncertainty and will help reduce the equity risk
premium,” said Wang Weijun, a strategist at Zheshang Securities
Co. in Shanghai.  The Shanghai Composite’s trading volume dropped to the
lowest level since Aug. 31 today, with 4.8 billion shares
changing hands, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
index’s 30-day volatility was at 14.2, compared with this year’s
average of 17.2. The gauge trades at 9.8 times estimated profit
for 2012, compared with the 17.8 average multiple since
Bloomberg began compiling the weekly  data  in 2006.  Yuan Appreciation  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  climbed 1.1 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US
55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, fell 2.2 percent in New York yesterday.  The yuan climbed as much as 0.02 percent to 6.2252 per
dollar in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. That’s the strongest level since China unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Nanzhi, a paper maker in the southern province of Fujian,
jumped by the 10 percent daily cap to 3.85 yuan. Mudanjiang
Hengfeng Paper Co. gained 2.6 percent to 6.40 yuan.  Shandong
Bohui Paper Industrial Co. (600966)  rose 1.4 percent to 4.50 yuan.  A gauge of material stocks in the CSI 300 rose 1.2 percent,
the most among 10 industry groups. Aluminum Corp., the listed
unit of the biggest maker of the lightweight metal, surged 4.7
percent to 4.95  yuan , the most since Sept. 7.  Yunnan Aluminium
Co. (000807) , the fifth largest, rose 2.7 percent to 4.98 yuan.  The China State Bureau of Material Reserve will soon start
buying the first batch of 160,000 tons of aluminum for reserves,
the China Securities Journal reported. Yunnan Aluminium, Jiaozuo
Wanfang Aluminum Manufacturing Co. and Henan Shenhuo Coal &
Power Co. are among companies that could bid to sell aluminum to
the bureau, the newspaper said.  Central Committee  The Shanghai Composite retreated 2.4 percent during the
18th Communist Party Congress period, which started Nov. 8.   Xi
is forecast to assume the state presidency from Hu Jintao in
March, when Li is set to take over the premiership from  Wen
Jiabao .  Other members re-elected today to the Central Committee
include Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang, Shanghai party boss Yu
Zhengsheng and propaganda minister Liu Yunshan, according to a
list published by the official Xinhua News Agency. Members of
the ruling Politburo and its standing committee, which exercises
ultimate power in China, are drawn from the group’s ranks.  Vice Premier  Wang Qishan , China’s counterpart to U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner , was named to the party’s
discipline body, indicating he won’t have a post directly
overseeing the economy in a new government.  Catching Up  China International Travel tumbled 10 percent to 28.49
yuan. The stock resumed trading after the company said it plans
to sell 98.5 million shares at 26.93 yuan each through a private
placement. The stock traded at 31.66 yuan on Nov. 6 before being
suspended.  Yuan-denominated shares may catch up to gains in Chinese
companies listed in Hong Kong as the nation’s economy improves,
 Jing Ulrich , Hong Kong-based chairman of global markets for
China at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a Bloomberg Television
interview today.  Industrial production, fixed-asset investment, retail sales
and exports growth exceeded economists’ estimates last month,
according to government reports. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  had rallied 10 percent through yesterday since the start
of September, compared with a less than 0.1 percent gain for the
Shanghai Composite.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined 1.6 percent to a one-
month low of $35.98 yesterday.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Darren Boey, Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
