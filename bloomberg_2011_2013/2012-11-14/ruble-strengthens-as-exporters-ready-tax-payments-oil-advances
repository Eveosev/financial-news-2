The ruble jumped the most this
month, bolstered by monthly tax payments, even as a software
glitch halted  currency trading  at the Moscow Exchange for more
than 2 1/2 hours.  The ruble appreciated 0.3 percent to 31.6800 against the
dollar by 7 p.m. in Moscow, the biggest gain since Nov. 1.
Trading stopped at 3:58 p.m. in Moscow.  Russian companies are supporting the ruble by buying the
currency to pay taxes, starting tomorrow, Igor Akinshin, a
trader at Moscow-based  Alfa Bank , said by phone. The Moscow
Exchange resumed trading at 6:40 p.m., it said on its website.
The halt was due to a software error, Micex spokesman Nikita
Bekasov said by phone.  “The corporates see a good rate and many wanted to convert
ahead of the tax period,” Akinshin said by phone.  The ruble fell 0.1 percent versus the euro at 40.3825 and
was up 0.1 percent against the central bank’s euro-dollar target
basket at 35.5961.  Russia’s  Finance Ministry  sold the smallest amount of
ruble-denominated  government bonds  due in 2027 today as  Europe ’s
debt crisis curbed appetite for riskier assets. It sold 9.03
billion rubles ($286 million) out of 25 billion rubles offered
of so-called OFZs at an average yield of 7.72 percent, the top
end of guidance given yesterday.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 32.1698 per
dollar in three months compared with 32.2265 yesterday.  The extra yield that investors demand to own Russia’s
dollar bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  fell three basis points to
198, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An
index of five-year government bond yields rose six basis points
to 7.1283 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
