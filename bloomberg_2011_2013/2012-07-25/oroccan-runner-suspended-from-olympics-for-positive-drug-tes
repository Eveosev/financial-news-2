Moroccan 1500-meter runner Alaoui
Selsouli will be suspended from the Olympics after testing
positive for a banned diuretic, the International Association of
Athletics Federations said today.  Selsouli waived her right to have her back-up sample
tested, the IAAF said in an e-mailed statement, meaning sheâ€™ll
be suspended for all competitions. She can request a hearing by
the national athletic federation within the next 3 months, the
IAAF said. A sample taken after a meeting in Paris earlier this
month tested positive for furosemide, which is a banned
substance, the IAAF said.  The London games officially begin in two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
