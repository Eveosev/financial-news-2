Gold gained the most in more than
three weeks on speculation that European leaders may take
further steps to tame the debt crisis.  European Central Bank council member  Ewald Nowotny  said
today there were arguments in favor of giving the region’s
rescue fund a banking license. The move would give the permanent
bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, access to ECB
lending, increasing cash available for aid. Gold has dropped 7.3
percent since Jan. 31, partly as  Europe ’s escalating crisis
damped global growth prospects and inflation expectations.  “This is a market fueled by emotional readings of certain
words coming from certain quarters,” Jon Nadler, an analyst at
Kitco Inc., a precious-metal refiner and research company in
 Montreal , said in a report. “People are expecting some form of
stimulus monetary action sooner rather than later.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 2 percent to settle
at $1,612.70 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in  New York , the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since June 29.  Silver futures for September delivery jumped 2.4 percent to
$27.466 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest gain since July 3.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery climbed 0.9 percent to $1,399.40 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery increased 0.6 percent
to $565.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
