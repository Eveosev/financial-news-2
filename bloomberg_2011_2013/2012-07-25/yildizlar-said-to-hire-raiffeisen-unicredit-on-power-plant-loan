Yildizlar SSS Holding , a Turkish
group with interests in energy, ceramics and silver mining, has
hired  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  to
borrow 400 million euros ($484 million) to build a coal-fired
power plant, a person familiar with the matter said.  The loan will have a maturity of 10 years including a 3-
year grace period, said the person, who declined to be

the central Turkish province of Cankiri, where the Istanbul-
based company has a coal mining license, the person said.  Sebahattin Yildiz, chairman of Yildizlar, didnâ€™t answer two
phone calls to his office seeking comment. Andrea Morawski, a
