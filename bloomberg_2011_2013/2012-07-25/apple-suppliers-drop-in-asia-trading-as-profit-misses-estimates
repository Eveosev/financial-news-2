Apple Inc. (AAPL)  suppliers Samsung
Electronics Co. and  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  led declines in Asian  trading 
and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the iPhone and iPad
assembler, fell after the world’s most valuable tech company
missed profit estimates.  Toshiba, the world’s largest flash memory maker after
Samsung, slumped 7.3 percent, the steepest drop since the plunge
after Japan’s March 11, 2011 earthquake, to 242 yen at the close
of trading in Tokyo. Hon Hai dropped 4.3 percent, the biggest
slump since April 30, to NT$81.90 at the Taipei close.  “Apple’s result dispelled hopes that its suppliers would
be doing better than other technology companies,”  Makoto Sengoku , a Tokyo-based analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co.,
said today by phone. “Investors aren’t patient enough to wait
and see potential demand increases for new models, as they focus
on the short-term performance.”  Apple  itself fell 4.9 percent in German trading, adding to
concern orders for components to make the iPhones and iPad
tablet computers may slow. Apple missed analysts’ estimates as
customers held off on iPhone purchases while waiting for a new
model to be introduced later in the year.  Samsung dropped 1 percent to 1.16 million won as of the
close in Seoul trading.  Apple’s net income climbed 21 percent to $8.82 billion, or
$9.32 a share, in the period that ended June 30, the Cupertino,
California-based company said yesterday in a statement. Sales
rose 23 percent to $35 billion. Analysts had  predicted  profit of
$10.37 a share on revenue of $37.2 billion, the average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Among other suppliers,  Seiko Epson Corp. (6724)  declined 7.5
percent,  Sony Corp. (6758)  slumped 5.2 percent,  LG Display Co. (034220)  lost 4.8
percent and Sharp Corp. plunged 10 percent.  While Apple outgrew its closest technology-industry peers,
the company’s sales climbed at the slowest pace since mid-2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
