Vietnam ’s three-year bonds rose,
driving down yields to a two-week low, on speculation efforts by
the central bank to promote a stable currency will boost demand
from foreign investors.  The nation’s currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of a daily reference rate, which has been
kept at 20,828 per dollar since Dec. 26. Inflation slowed to an
annualized 5.35 percent in July, the least since November 2009,
the General Statistics Office in Hanoi reported yesterday.  “Foreign investors probably have a more positive view of
the Vietnamese economy,” said Ha Thi Quynh Trang, a Hanoi-based
fixed-income trader at Bank for Investment & Development of
Vietnam. “If the  exchange rate  remains stable toward the end of
the year, more foreign investors will participate in the  bond
market .”  The yield on three-year notes fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 9.72 percent, the lowest level since
July 11, according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong was little changed at 20,885 per dollar as of 3:15
p.m. in Hanoi, compared with 20,880 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has traded at an average
rate of 20,894 this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
