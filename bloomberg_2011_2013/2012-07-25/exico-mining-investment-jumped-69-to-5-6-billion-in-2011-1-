Investments by mining companies in
 Mexico  surged 69 percent to $5.6 billion last year, more than a
March estimate of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion, the head of the
nation’s mining chamber said.  Mining companies will probably invest about $7.6 billion in
2012, Sergio Almazan, head of the chamber known as Camimex, said
at an event in Mexico City today. Almazan said total 2011
investments exceeded the chamber’s previous report because
member companies provided more information on their projects
after the chamber’s March 13 estimate.  Mexico is the world’s top silver producer, and the metal
accounted for 27 percent of the nation’s mine output last year,
compared with 25 percent for gold and 20 percent for copper, the
chamber said. Mexico was the top  Latin America  destination for
investment in exploration for non-iron metals in 2011 and the
fourth in the world behind  Canada ,  Australia  and the U.S., the
chamber said.  “We’re seeing that Mexico can compete with anywhere in
Latin America in attracting mining investment,” Almazan said
today in an interview. “As long as metals prices remain at good
levels, we’ll continue to see this interest in investing.”  Mexico’s mining industry directly employs 328,000 people in
Mexico. It created 26,000 jobs last year and will add an
additional 18,000 this year, Almazan said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
