The Washington Nationals sent the
New York Mets to their 12th loss in 13 games as  Stephen Strasburg  allowed one run over seven innings in a 5-2 victory.  Strasburg had 11 strikeouts and surrendered four hits,
including a second-inning solo home run to  Ike Davis , at New
York’s Citi Field. Strasburg, who improved to 11-4, had lost
three of his previous four decisions.  Michael Morse, Danny Espinosa and Adam LaRoche hit home
runs for the Nationals, who swept the three-game series to match
the  New York Yankees  for the best record in Major League
Baseball at 58-39. The Yankees play the Seattle Mariners today.  The Mets have lost six straight games for the second time
this month to fall to 47-51 and drop 11 1/2 games behind first-
place Washington in the National League Eastern Division. They
have one win in 12 games since the All-Star break.  Jeremy Hefner was the losing pitcher for the Mets after
getting called up from Triple-A Buffalo to replace the injured
 Johan Santana . Hefner allowed three runs in six innings,
including back-to-back homers to Morse and Espinosa in the top
of the second inning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
