Verbund AG (VER) ,  Austria ’s largest
utility, said it expects full-year earnings before interest and
tax to decline 20 percent, falling more than analysts are
expecting.  The company is predicting Ebit to fall to about 800 million
euros ($966 million) from 998.4 million euros last year, Vienna-
based Verbund said today in a statement. That compares to an
 average estimate  of 932.4 million euros, according to 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Verbund’s net income forecast of
350 million euros also falls short of analysts’ 480.7 million-
euro estimate. The company had net income of 352.6 million euros
last year.  Verbund is basing its guidance on the assumption of an
average water supply in the second half, Chief Executive Officer
Wolfgang Anzengruber told reporters in Vienna today. “If the
conditions in the overall economy and the energy sector in
 Europe  continue to worsen, additional negative effects on
earnings in the second half of 2012 cannot be ruled out,” he
said.  Second-quarter net income rose 16 percent to 78.8 million
euros, missing analysts estimates of 90.3 million euros. The
company had a 52 million-euro impairment on its Mellach plant
and also had to take a 48 million-euro hit on its plant in Toul.
The hydro coefficient of the run-of-river power plants was at
1.09 in the first half of the year, 9 percent above the long-
term average, Verbund said.  Shares fell 2.7 percent to 14.5 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Vienna.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
