Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP) ,  India ’s
second-biggest maker of the alloy by market value, fell to a
three-year low after first-quarter profit unexpectedly declined
because of an impairment charge on an investment in Bolivia.  The shares dropped as much as 3.6 percent to 400 rupees and
traded at 405.55 rupees as of 9:33 a.m. in Mumbai, the lowest
intraday level since July 14, 2009. The stock has fallen 36
percent in the past year compared with an 11 percent decline in
the benchmark Sensitive Index.  Profit was lower after Jindal Steel wrote off 5.74 billion
rupees ($102 million) in the quarter, equal to its investment in
developing a 20 billion metric ton Bolivian iron ore mine. The
company last week terminated the $2.1 billion project, which
included building steel and power plants.  Net income , including that of units, dropped 58 percent to
3.9 billion rupees in the three months ended June 30, New Delhi-
based  Jindal Steel  said yesterday in a statement. The median of
15  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was a profit of 10.9
billion rupees.  The company’s steel product sales rose 23 percent while
electricity gained 85 percent. Wholesale prices of construction-
grade steel products in India rose 11 percent from a year
earlier, spurred by higher demand from builders of roads, ports
and bridges.  Jindal Steel, run by billionaire lawmaker Naveen Jindal,
plans to quadruple steelmaking capacity in three years. The
company targets steel production capacity of 13 million tons a
year by 2015 and the addition of more than 10,400 megawatts of
power plants in eight years.  Jindal Steel will buy Canada’s CIC Energy Corp. for C$116
million ($114 million) to secure access to its  coal mine  in
 Africa . It agreed to pay C$2 in cash for each CIC Energy share,
the target company said in a statement on July 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
