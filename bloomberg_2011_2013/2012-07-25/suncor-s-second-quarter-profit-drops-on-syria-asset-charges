Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest
energy company by market value, reported second-quarter profit
that beat analysts’ estimates as its  oil-sands  production costs
fell.  Excluding one-time expenses, per-share profit exceeded the
74-cent average of 17  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Net income declined to C$333 million ($326 million), or 20 cents
a share, from C$562 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier as  oil
prices  dropped, the Calgary-based company said in a statement
yesterday.  Cash operating costs for its oil-sands projects fell to
C$39 a barrel in the quarter, a 19 percent decrease from the
same period a year earlier. The company cited higher output,
less maintenance and a drop in natural-gas costs for the
decline. Sales rose 4.2 percent to C$9.72 billion.  “On the cost side, we’re seeing consistently that the best
assets, like those at Suncor and Cenovus, help control costs
over time,” said Chris Theal, chief executive officer of
Kootenay Capital Management Corp. in Calgary, which owns shares
in both companies.  Suncor  rose  2.1 percent to C$30.39 at 12:59 p.m. in
Toronto. The stock, which has gained 3.5 percent this year, has
20 buy and three hold ratings from analysts.  Output rose 18 percent in the quarter to the equivalent of
542,400 barrels a day from 460,000 a year earlier, the company
said. Average daily oil-sands production, excluding its stake in
Syncrude Canada Ltd., climbed to 309,200 barrels a day from
243,400 barrels a year earlier.  Libyan Recovery  Suncor narrowed the range of its 2012 daily average
production forecast to the equivalent of 540,000 barrels to
580,000 barrels. International output was raised to as much as
85,000 barrels, from a 75,000-barrel estimate on April 30.  Suncor may consider delaying development of some of its
oil-sands projects with partner  Total SA (FP)  as the companies review
their profitability, Chief Executive Officer  Steve Williams  said
in a conference call with analysts today. The company formed an
alliance in 2010 with France’s Total to develop the Fort Hills,
Joslyn and Voyageur projects in  Alberta .  “In principle, there is the opportunity to not progress
those projects,” he said.  Libya  produced an average of 42,700 barrels a day during
the quarter, compared with no production a year earlier while
the nation was undergoing a civil war. International output rose
98 percent in the quarter, even with no production from  Syria ,
which averaged the equivalent of 18,100 barrels a day in the
second quarter of 2011.  Suncor recorded a C$694 million one-time cost in the period
due to political unrest in Syria. The company suspended its
 Syrian operations , which supplies about 10 percent of the
nation’s gas, in December.  Refinery Margin  Gas prices  in  North America  and the permanent shuttering of
a processing plant prompted the company to halt the equivalent
of about 23 million cubic feet of daily production in certain
fields in Canada.  Suncor earned more for processing heavy oil sands into
fuels and other products as the price of Canadian crude fell
during the quarter. Profit from refining and marketing rose 59
percent to C$499 million.  “We saw crude prices drop by $25 per barrel in the
quarter,” Williams said. “Markets reacted to a very uncertain
macroeconomic situation.”  Suncor said 96 percent of its production is exposed to
global oil prices, with the remaining 4 percent based on West
Texas Intermediate, a U.S. benchmark. The company processes most
of its production at its four North American refineries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
