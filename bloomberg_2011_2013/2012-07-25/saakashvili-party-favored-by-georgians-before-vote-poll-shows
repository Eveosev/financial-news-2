Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili’s party would beat billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s
opposition coalition in snap parliamentary elections, a poll
showed.  About 43 percent of likely voters would back Saakashvili’s
National Movement, according to the International Republican
Institute, which conducted the survey. Ivanishvili’s party, set
up to challenge in October’s ballot, had 24 percent backing. The
president, whose second term ends next year, had a job-approval
rating of 73 percent.  The nationwide survey, funded by the U.S. Agency for
International Development, polled 1,503 people in June and July
and has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
