     July 25 (Bloomberg) -- Riverbed Technology Inc., a maker of
computer-networking products, gained the most in almost six
years after saying the company remains on track to post annual
revenue 15 percent higher than a year earlier.  Riverbed  advanced  26 percent to $18.32 at the close in New
York, for the biggest jump since September 2006. The San
Francisco-based company’s shares have dropped 22 percent this
year.  Riverbed, which creates technology to help customers keep
their software in far-flung data centers more efficiently, has
benefited from the growth of cloud computing. Yesterday, it
announced a $75 million deal with  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) , which
will license the company’s products to boost application
performance.  Full-year revenue will increase about 15 percent from a
year earlier, the company said yesterday. The average analyst
estimate was for a jump of about 12 percent from 2011 sales of
$726.5 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “That 15 percent number is achievable, assuming the
economy holds out,” Randy Gottfried, the company’s chief
financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts
yesterday after the company reported second-quarter earnings.
“But we’ll see. Again, we’re focused quarter-on-quarter.”  Profit in the second quarter excluding some items totaled
23 cents a share, according to a statement. Analysts projected
21 cents, the average of analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
