LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3)  led losses on the
 Brazil ’s benchmark Bovespa Index after saying it’s not planning
any new deals, damping speculation that controlling shareholder
 Eike Batista  may buy back all outstanding stock and delist the
ports company.  LLX  fell  6.1 percent to close at 2.63 reais in Sao Paulo
trading, the most since July 16. The Bovespa was little changed.  LLX, which is building the Acu port in Rio de Janeiro
state, earlier this week posted its biggest two-day gain since
2009 as investors speculated that Batista may delist the company
after the shares dropped about 40 percent in the past 12 months.
LLX said in a regulatory  filing  late yesterday it doesn’t have
any proposal for new “corporate arrangements.”  “The company is always pursuing to maximize value to its
shareholders and constantly studying possibilities of engaging
in new deals and corporate arrangements,” LLX said in the
filing. “Currently, there is no proposal, binding document or
decision in this regard.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
