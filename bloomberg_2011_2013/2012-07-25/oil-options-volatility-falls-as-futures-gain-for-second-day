Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures advanced for a second day after the euro
snapped five days of losses against the dollar.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.4 percent at 4:25 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 33.1 yesterday.  Crude oil for September delivery rose 47 cents to settle at
$88.97 a barrel on the Nymex. The dollar declined 0.8 percent
against the euro at 4:17 p.m. in  New York , increasing the
investment appeal of commodities.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $80 puts, which fell 12 cents to 38 cents a barrel at
4:34 p.m. with 2,758 lots trading. September $85 puts were the
second-most active options, with 2,159 lots changing hands as
they declined 29 cents to $1.25 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 54
percent of the 85,271 contracts traded.  October $80 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday, with 3,599 lots changing hands. They fell 20 cents to
$1.57 a barrel. September $85 puts declined 33 cents to $1.54 on
volume of 2,811.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 43,770
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 41,601 lots and
December $120 calls with 39,072.  To contact the reporter on this story:
