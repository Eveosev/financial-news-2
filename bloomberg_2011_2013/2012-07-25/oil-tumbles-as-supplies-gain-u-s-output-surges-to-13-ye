Oil increased after financial shares
led U.S. equities higher and the euro advanced against the
dollar for the first time in six days.  Futures rose 0.5 percent as the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
headed for its first gain in four days. A stronger euro and
weaker dollar bolster oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.
Prices dropped as much as 1.9 percent earlier after an Energy
Department report showed U.S. stockpiles unexpectedly climbed as
production surged to the highest level in 13 years.  “Oil is up because you’re seeing a rise in all risk assets
and the euro is showing strength,” said Bill O’Grady, chief
market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in  St.
Louis , which oversees $1.4 billion. “I don’t see this rally
continuing because the inventory numbers today were lousy.”  Crude oil for September delivery advanced 47 cents to
$88.97 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
touched $86.84, the lowest intraday level since July 16. Prices
are down 10 percent this year.  Brent oil for September settlement rose 96 cents, or 0.9
percent, to end the session at $104.38 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The  S&P 500  climbed 0.1 percent and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  advanced 0.6 percent at 3:16 p.m. in  New
York . The euro rose 0.8 percent to $1.2157. The common currency
touched $1.2043 yesterday, the lowest level since July 2010.  U.S. crude  supplies  rose 2.72 million barrels to 380.1
million last week, the Energy Department report showed. A 1
million-barrel decrease was projected, according to the median
of 11 analyst responses in a Bloomberg survey. U.S.  crude output 
advanced 1.9 percent to 6.36 million, the highest level since
February 1999.  ‘Very Bearish’  “The inventory numbers were very bearish,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund that focuses on energy. “We’ve been seeing a steady
increase in U.S. oil production over the last two years, which
is quite a turnaround from the prior trend.”  Crude imports rose 696,000 barrels a day to 9.63 million in
the seven days ended July 20, the most since March, according to
the department.  Fuel imports  surged 859,000 barrels to 2.58
million, the biggest gain since the week ended Jan, 7, 2011.  Refineries operated at 93 percent of capacity, up 1
percentage point from the prior week and the highest rate since
July 2007. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected that the
report would show a 0.1 percentage point decline in utilization
to 91.9 percent.  “Production climbed to a new high,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “There
was a surge in imports, more than outpacing the increase in
refinery runs.”  Fuel Stockpiles  Gasoline  inventories  gained 4.13 million barrels to 210
million last week, the biggest increase in 2012. They were
forecast to decline 1 million barrels, according to the median
of 11 responses in the Bloomberg survey.  Gasoline for August delivery dropped 3.19 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $2.7929 a gallon in New York. It touched
$2.7298, the lowest level since July 10, in intraday trading.  “The crude market is higher but gasoline is still very
weak,” O’Grady said. “The gasoline market has a number of
issues that won’t be solved anytime soon.”  Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, climbed 1.71 million barrels to 125.2
million last week, the report showed.  “You are seeing higher production while demand continues
to be weak,” said  Mike Wittner , head of oil market research at
Societe Generale SA in New York. “The demand numbers for core
products such as gasoline, distillate and jet kerosene are not
just bearish in themselves. They are also in line with a
lackluster economy.”  Gasoline Demand  Gasoline consumption  fell 0.5 percent to an average 8.8
million barrels a day in the four weeks ended July 20, leaving
demand 3.2 percent lower than a year earlier. Use of distillate
fuel dropped 2.4 percent and jet kerosene decreased 5.1 percent
in the past four weeks.  Total stockpiles of crude oil and fuel, excluding the
government’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, climbed 10.1 million
barrels to 1.11 billion, the highest level since November 2010,
the report showed. Supplies have increased more than 10 million
barrels four times in the past year.  “There are lots of hydrocarbons around,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of commodities research at IAF Advisors in
Houston. “Supplies rose more than 10 million barrels, something
we don’t see very much.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 458,139
contracts as of 3:16 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 496,638
contracts yesterday, 11 percent below the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.39 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
