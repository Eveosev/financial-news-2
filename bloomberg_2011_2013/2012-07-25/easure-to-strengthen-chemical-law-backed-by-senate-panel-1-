The Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee voted along party lines to approve a measure
that would toughen chemical-safety laws overseen by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.  The measure, which was approved by the committee 10-8,
would require safety testing of all industrial chemicals and
force chemical makers to show that new compounds are safe. Under
current law, the Environmental Protection Agency can only call
for safety testing after evidence is presented showing that a
chemical is dangerous.  Under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the EPA requires
companies to provide analyses of certain chemicals they make or
use. New Jersey Senator  Frank Lautenberg , the author of the
overhaul measure, said rules in place since 1976 need updating.  “While the panel voted along party lines, with all
Republicans opposing the measure, outside the Beltway support
for stronger protections against toxic chemicals is not a
partisan issue,”  Daniel Rosenberg , director of the toxic
chemicals reform project at the  Natural Resources Defense
Council  in  Washington , said in a statement. “This sets the
stage for the Senate to finally give the Environmental
Protection Agency the tools it needs to protect all of us from
toxic chemicals found in products we use every day.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
