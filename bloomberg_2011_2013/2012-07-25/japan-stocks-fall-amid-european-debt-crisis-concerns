Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index posting its biggest four-day drop since August, as the yen
traded near an 11-year high against the euro amid concern
Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  Makita Corp., a toolmaker that gets 40 percent of its sales
in Europe, lost 3.1 percent.  Murata Manufacturing Co. (6981) , a
supplier of smartphone parts for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone, tumbled
4.2 percent after profit and sales at Apple missed analysts’
estimates.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer
electronics, dropped 5.2 percent to the lowest since 1980 as the
yen rose against its major counterparts after a report showed
the country had an unexpected  trade surplus  in June.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 1.4 percent to
8,365.90 at the close of trading in  Tokyo . The broader Topix
Index slipped 1.6 percent to 706.46, losing 5.4 percent in the
last four days. The broadest measure of Japanese stocks fell for
the 13th time in 14 days and has slumped 19 percent from this
year’s highest level in March amid concern Greece won’t meet its
debt-reduction targets and as growth slowed in  China  and the
U.S.  “Sentiment has deteriorated so much that investors are
ignoring cheap valuations and selling to cut their losses,”
said Goya Nakao, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan
Nipponkoa Asset Management Co., which oversees about 5 trillion
yen ($63 billion). “Stocks and sectors that are highly
dependent on external demand just keep falling.”  Valuations Fall  Declines since March left shares on the Topix valued at 0.8
times book value, compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number below
one means investors can buy companies for less than the value of
their assets.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  gained 7 percent to 22.64,
the highest in a month, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 6.5 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Companies exporting into Europe fell as Greek Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras prepares to meet with the country’s
troika of international creditors representing the European
Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the  International
Monetary Fund  on July 27.  Makita lost 3.1 percent to 2,482 yen. Mitsubishi Motors
Corp., that makes 26 percent of sales in Europe, declined 2.9
percent to 68 yen.  Suppliers to Apple declined after the world’s largest
company by market value predicted further declines in sales and
profit for the current period from last quarter. Murata sank 4.2
percent to 3,815 yen.  Toshiba Plunges  Toshiba Corp., which makes chips used in Apple’s iPads,
sank 7.3 percent to 242 yen as CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets
recommended investors sell the stock.  Sony slid 5.2 percent to 870 yen.  Japan  posted a record
trade deficit of 2.9 trillion yen in the six months ended June.
Japan’s government said this week that signs of a global
slowdown have increased as it became more pessimistic about the
prospects for China, Japan’s largest trading partner.  Among stocks that gained, Softbank Corp. climbed 4 percent
to 2,946 yen as Bank of America Corp. named the
telecommunications company among its top picks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
