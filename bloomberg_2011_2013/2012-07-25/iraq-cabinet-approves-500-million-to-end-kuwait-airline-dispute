Iraq’s Cabinet agreed to allocate
$500 million from the budget to resolve a dispute with  Kuwait 
over the debts of  Iraqi Airways , State Minister Ali al-Dabbagh
said.  The Cabinet asked parliament to approve the allocation of
$300 million from the 2012 budget and another $200 million the
following year, al-Dabbagh said in an e-mailed statement today.
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced an agreement with
Kuwait to end the dispute in March.  State-run Kuwait Airways Corp. has been seeking $1.2
billion in compensation for 10 aircraft taken during former
Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein ’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Maliki agreed to pay $300 million in compensation to the carrier
and another $200 million to establish a joint airline with
Kuwait, which will contribute a similar amount.  Iraq still owes Kuwait about $20 billion as a result of
that invasion. It is paying into a United Nations compensation
fund even as its economy tries to recover from decades of
conflict, sanctions and sabotage, nine years after the U.S.-led
invasion that ousted Hussein.  To contact the reporter on this story:
