Cnooc Ltd.’s takeover bid for
Canadian oil producer Nexen Inc. signals a “wise and
justified” focus on  energy security  by China, the International
Energy Agency’s chief economist said.  State-run Cnooc agreed on July 23 to pay $15.1 billion in
cash to acquire Nexen, operator and 43 percent owner of the
Buzzard field, which plays a role in setting benchmark North Sea
crude. Oil prices, already too high for the global economy, may
advance further once the European debt crisis ends, making
China’s pursuit of supplies a “well-justified and wise
policy,” IEA Chief Economist  Fatih Birol  said.  “After the crisis is over we may well see much higher
prices than now, and oil security will be a significant
problem,” Birol said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “The Pulse” with  Maryam Nemazee . “Imports will
increase, and China is trying to secure those supplies.”  Brent crude traded at about $103 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange today.  Such a level is “far too high for the fragile economic
situation” in Europe and the U.S., Birol said. The Paris-based
IEA advises oil-consuming nations on  energy policy . High crude
prices are also contributing to a slowdown in economic expansion
in China, which will account for 40 percent of this year’s fuel
demand growth, he said.  Cnooc’s purchase of Nexen is a “justified acquisition”
within a free market, Birol said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
