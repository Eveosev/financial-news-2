New Zealand ’s central bank held its
benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 2.5 percent for an 11th
straight meeting, Governor Alan Bollard said in a statement
today in Wellington.  The decision to extend the pause in the official cash rate
was forecast by all 16 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand’s last change in borrowing costs
was a cut in March 2011.  “‘‘New Zealand’s trading partner outlook remains poor,
with several euro-area economies in recession,’’ Bollard said in
the statement. ‘‘There remains a limited risk that conditions in
the euro area deteriorate very significantly. The Bank continues
to monitor the situation carefully given the potential for rapid
change.’’  Gross domestic product in the first quarter grew at the
fastest pace in five years, while second-quarter annual
inflation of 1 percent was the slowest since 1999, government
data showed since the RBNZ’s previous meeting June 14. The
central bank is required to target inflation in a range of 1
percent to 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
