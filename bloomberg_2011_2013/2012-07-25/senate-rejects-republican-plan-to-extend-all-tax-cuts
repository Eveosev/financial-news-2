The U.S. Senate rejected a
Republican proposal to extend the George W. Bush-era tax cuts
for all income levels through 2013.  The Senateâ€™s 45-54 vote against the Republican amendment
will be followed by a vote on a Democratic plan, backed by
President  Barack Obama , to extend most of the tax cuts while
letting those for top earners expire at the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
