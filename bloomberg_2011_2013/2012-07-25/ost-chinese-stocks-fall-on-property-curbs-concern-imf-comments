Chinese stocks  fell to their lowest
level since 2009 as the  International Monetary Fund  said the
country’s economy faces significant downside risks and investors
speculated the government won’t loosen property curbs.  A gauge of real estate companies slumped 1.9 percent, led
by  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , as the government said it will
send teams across the nation to check that housing curbs are
being implemented and the  China  Securities Journal said
transaction charges on the sales of homes may increase.  Kweichow
Moutai Co. (600519) , China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor by market
value, paced gains by consumer-staples producers on earnings
optimism.  “Property stocks are facing increasing policy risks,”
said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief investment officer at
Jingxi Investment Management Co., which manages about $120
million. “If there are new measures to curb the  property
market , that’ll limit room for macro policy easing.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  retreated 0.5 percent to
2,136.15 at the close, its lowest level since March 2009. The
 CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slipped 0.7 percent to 2,360.08. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, climbed 0.4 percent in New York yesterday.  China’s slowing economy relies too much on investment,
directors of the IMF executive board said in a statement
released today, urging leaders to boost consumption and channel
citizens’ savings away from housing.  2009 Low  Achieving a so-called “soft landing” is a key challenge,
the IMF said. It repeated an assessment that the  yuan  is
“moderately” undervalued, which China disputed.  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 13 percent from this
year’s high on March 2 to trade near its lowest level since
March 2009 amid concern the economic slowdown is deepening. The
gauge is valued at 9.5 times estimated profit, compared with the
average of 17.5 since Bloomberg began compiling the  data  in
2006.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  dropped 1 percent today as
Greece’s creditors met to assess how far the debt-stricken
nation has strayed from bailout terms and after Apple Inc.’s
profit and sales missed analysts’ estimate.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai index was at 14.4
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.9. About 5.5
billion shares changed hands in the gauge yesterday, 34 percent
lower than the daily average this year.  China Vanke Co., the nation’s biggest listed property
developer, lost 2.5 percent to 9.10 yuan. Poly Real Estate, the
second largest, fell 2.5 percent to 11.15 yuan.  China Merchants
Property Development Co. (000024) , the third biggest, slid 2.5 percent to
23 yuan.  Property Curbs  The State Council will send eight teams to 16 provinces
including Beijing and Shanghai from late July to check the
implementation of property curbs, according to a statement
posted to the central government website yesterday.  The nationwide check aims to “firmly” restrain property
speculation and consolidate the result of property curbs, it
said. The groups will also check the implementation of home-
buying restriction policies, credit and tax policies and the
supply of land, according to the statement.  In addition to higher transaction taxes, the government may
also impose a property tax on vacant homes, the China Securities
Journal reported today, it said, citing an unidentified person.  A measure of consumer-staples stocks rose 0.1 percent on
the CSI 300, the only one of 10 industry groups to gain, and
extending this year’s advance to 9.9 percent.  Kweichow Moutai climbed 2.5 percent to 255.55 yuan toward a
record-high.  Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery Joint-Stock Co. (002304)  added 0.9
percent to 146.44 yuan. JiuGuiJiu Co. rallied 3.8 percent to
53.11 yuan.  Earnings Reports  Major liquor makers including Kweichow Moutai and Wuliangye
Yibin Co. may report between 40 percent and 60 percent increases
in first-half profit, Qi Ying, an analyst at Haitong Securities
Co., wrote in a report yesterday.  Chinese publicly traded companies are required to release
first-half earnings results in July and August. Of the 885
companies in the Shanghai Composite, the 22 that reported
second-quarter earnings had an average 5.5 percent profit
decline, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Profit rose
2.8 percent in the first quarter, the data showed.  Great Wall Motor Co. (601633) , China’s biggest pickup truck maker,
rose 2 percent to 16.05 yuan. First-half net income rose 30
percent from a year earlier, the company said in a statement
yesterday.  Citic Securities Co. raised Great Wall Motor’s earnings
estimate for this year by 9 percent, citing strong sales of
sports-utility vehicles, Li Chunbo, an analyst at the brokerage,
wrote in a report today.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
