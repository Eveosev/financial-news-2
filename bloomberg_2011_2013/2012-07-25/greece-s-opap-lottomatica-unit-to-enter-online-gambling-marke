Opap SA (OPAP)  of  Greece , Europe’s biggest
listed gambling company, chose Italy’s  Lottomatica SpA (LTO)  G2 unit
as its strategic partner to enter the online gaming market.  The two will create a joint venture to offer Internet
gaming services and will bid for any licenses offered by the
Greek state in the future, according to an e-mailed statement
from Athens-based Opap today.  Opap, of which the state owns 34 percent, last year
extended its monopoly on sports betting in Greece to 2030 and
paid the state 560 million euros ($677 million) to acquire the
license to operate 35,000 video lottery terminals. Selling a
stake in the company and licenses to operate lottery games are
part of Greece’s plan to cut debt by selling state assets.  Separately, Opap said it will examine an offer by  Intralot
SA (INLOT)  to run its terminal-based technological support. Intralot,
which has been Opap’s provider for the last 12 years, and Gtech
Holdings SA are the two companies that submitted bids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
