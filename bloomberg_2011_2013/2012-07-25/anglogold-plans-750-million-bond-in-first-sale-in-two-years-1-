AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the third-
largest gold producer, sold $750 million of securities in its
first offering in more than two years.  The mine operator issued 5.125 percent, 10-year bonds to
yield 380 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used
for general corporate purposes, according to a person familiar
with the transaction, who asked not to be identified because the
terms are private.  AngloGold last sold debt in April 2010, issuing $700
million of 5.375 percent, 10-year notes to yield 165 basis
points more than benchmarks and $300 million of 6.5 percent, 30-
year debentures at a spread of 200 basis points, according to
Bloomberg data.  The new bonds may be rated Baa2, the second-lowest level of
investment-grade, by Moodyâ€™s Investors Service, the data show.
Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc. are managing the sale for the
