Oil rose in New York, reversing
earlier losses amid speculation that Europe’s financial rescue
fund will receive a banking license to help solve the region’s
debt crisis.  West Texas Intermediate futures advanced as much as 0.8
percent, recouping an earlier decline of 0.8 percent. The euro
snapped five days of declines against the dollar, boosting the
appeal of commodities. Oil also increased before an Energy
Department report today that may show U.S. crude supplies shrank
 1 million barrels .  A license from the  European Central Bank  for the rescue
fund “could boost risk appetite in the short term,” said
 Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, who
estimates  Brent crude  futures should slide toward $100, based on
physical supply and demand. “But the price would be huge in the
long-term: high inflation and eroding confidence.”  Crude for September delivery rose as much as 66 cents to
$89.16 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was at $89.13 at 1:49 p.m. London time. Prices are
down 10 percent this year.  Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange gained as much as 44 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $103.86 a barrel. The European benchmark was at a
$14.70 premium to the New York-traded West Texas Intermediate
grade, from $14.92 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
