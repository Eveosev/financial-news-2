Cyprus must cut public sector wages
by as much as 15 percent, and social spending and pension
outlays by as much as 10 percent in exchange for an
international bailout,  Phileleftheros  reported today, without
saying where it obtained the information.  Representatives of the  International Monetary Fund , the
European Commission and the  European Central Bank , known as the
troika, who met Cypriot government officials yesterday, also
proposed suspending payment of government employeesâ€™ thirteenth
month salary this year, the Nicosia-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
