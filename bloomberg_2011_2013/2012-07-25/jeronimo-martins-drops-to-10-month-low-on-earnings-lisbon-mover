Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest retailer by market value, dropped to the lowest in
almost 10 months in Lisbon trading after reporting earnings that
missed analysts’ estimates as Polish consumption weakened.  The  stock  fell as much as 9.6 percent to 11.255 euros, the
lowest since October and the fourth consecutive decline. It
traded at 11.88 euros as of 12:27 p.m. in the Portuguese
capital. The shares have declined 6.7 percent this year, giving
the grocer a market value of 7.5 billion euros ($9.1 billion).  Jeronimo Martins said first-half net income rose 5.6
percent to 151.9 million euros, lower than a mean estimate of
158.6 million euros in a  survey  of analysts by Bloomberg.  “Jeronimo Martins shares have been falling, reflecting
this easing earnings momentum,” Jose Rito and Bruno Bessa,
analysts at  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  with a “neutral” recommendation on
the stock, said today in a research report.  The company said it expects the margin at the level of
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
in 2012 will be stable or “just below” last year’s level.
Polish unit Biedronka will miss a goal for “low double-digit”
growth in like-for-like sales this year due to slowing
economies, Jeronimo Martins said.  “Short-term sentiment will remain negative and the stock
price should react negatively following the company’s like-for-
like revision,” BPI’s Rito and Bessa said in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
