Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  said  Iran  will not bow to foreign pressure or
sanctions.  Khamenei spoke yesterday as Iranian and European Union
officials met in Istanbul in an attempt to establish common
ground for another round of international talks on the Islamic
Republic’s nuclear program. Those talks will be followed by
contact between EU foreign policy chief  Catherine Ashton  and
Saeed Jalili, Iran’s chief negotiator, Ashton’s office said
yesterday, without giving details of the talks.  The U.S. and its allies have raised concerns that Iran is
concealing a nuclear-weapons program, a charge Iran rejects, and
have imposed a series of sanctions against the country.  “The enemies explicitly say that by intensifying the
pressure and the sanctions, they are seeking to force Iranian
officials to reconsider their calculations,” Khamenei was
quoted as saying in Tehran yesterday by the state-run Fars news
agency. “In reality, we will not rethink our calculations, and
we will continue to trod the path of the Iranian nation more
resolutely.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
