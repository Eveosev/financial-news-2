British Land Co. (BLND) , the U.K.’s second-
largest real estate investment trust, agreed to buy two
buildings in central  London ’s Mayfair district and plans to
convert them into luxury homes, shops and offices.  British Land spent 129.6 million pounds ($202 million) for
the properties, the company said in a statement today. The
purchase includes almost an acre of land in the neighborhood,
which along with nearby St. James’s comprise the London
districts with  Europe ’s biggest concentration of  hedge funds .  The plan is British Land’s latest conversion of  office
space  into upscale mixed-use properties. It’s completed 143,000
square feet of London residential developments since early 2009.
The Mayfair properties, located near the Ritz hotel, will have a
value of about 500 million pounds once converted and the homes
may sell for more than 3,000 pounds a square foot, Chief
Executive Officer Chris Grigg said on a call with reporters.  There are “attractive” opportunities to make further
acquisitions and the company plans to continue selling assets to
raise cash for purchases, Grigg said.  British Land had “good” results in the quarter ended June
30, Grigg said. While the U.K. economy remains difficult, Grigg
said he expects British Land to meet its full-year targets.  Occupancy improved slightly to 98.1 percent, the London-
based company said in the statement. Visitors to its shops and
malls rose even as the average retail footfall dropped, British
Land said.  Leases Signed  Commercial leases signed in advance of building completions
rose to 85,000 square feet, bringing income from “pre-lets” to
41 million pounds. The U.K.’s Whiteley Shopping Centre, due to
open next year, is 76 percent rented. Tenants have been found
for 82 percent of the space at the Zaragoza mall in  Spain , due
to open in October, according to the company.  British Land rose 0.5 percent to 527.5 pence in London
trading. The shares have risen about 14 percent this year,
compared with the FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment Trust Index’s
16.8 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
