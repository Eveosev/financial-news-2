Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
vowed to prioritize the protection of a pipeline that feeds gas
to Jordan, several days after it was attacked for the 15th time
since  Hosni Mubarak â€™s ouster last year, the Jordanian foreign
minister said.  Jordan also asked  Egypt  to increase the amount of gas it
pumps to its neighbor, Nasser Judeh told reporters today
following a meeting with Mursi in Cairo. Gas supplies have been
disrupted 11 times for a total of 150 days since the attacks
began, Judeh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
