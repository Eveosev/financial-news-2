Fanuc Corp. (6954) , the worldâ€™s largest
maker of controls that run  machine tools , said first-quarter
profit gained amid higher demand.  Net income  rose 1.5 percent to 35.2 billion yen ($450
million) in the three months ended June 30, the Yamanashi,
Japan-based company said in a statement today. Sales rose 4.9
percent to 137.8 billion yen, it said.  Fanuc, whose yellow robots help Nissan Motor Co. weld cars,
is benefiting from an increase in demand from China for machines
to make automobiles and electronics. The value of the global
industrial robot-system market will double to $41 billion by
2020, according to an estimate by Daiwa  Capital Markets .  The  robot-maker  fell 2.7 percent to 12,040 yen at close of
trading in Tokyo, before the results were announced. The stock
has gained 2.2 percent this year, compared with a 1.1 percent
drop in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  The company kept its  profit forecast  unchanged at 75
billion yen for the six months ending Sept. 30, it said in the
statement. Sales may reach 275 billion yen, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
