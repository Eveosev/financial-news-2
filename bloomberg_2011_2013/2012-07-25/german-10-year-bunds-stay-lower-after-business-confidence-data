German 10-year bunds stayed lower
after a report showed business confidence fell for a third
straight month in July to the lowest in more than two years.  The  10-year yield  rose three basis points to 1.26 percent
at 9:04 a.m. London time. Two-year note yields were little
changed at minus 0.07 percent.  The rate on Spanish 10-year bonds was two basis points
higher at 7.64 percent.  The Ifo institute in Munich said its  business climate
index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped to 103.3
from 105.2 in June. Thatâ€™s the lowest reading since March 2010.
Economists predicted a decline to 104.5, according to the median
of 35 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
