The  New York Times (NYT)  dropped its
downloadable application for BlackBerry users, dealing a setback
to  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  as it races to introduce a new
version of the mobile device early next year.  BlackBerry users can still access the newspaper through the
mobile website, which will become the focus of its electronic-
publishing efforts, New York Times Co. said in a  message  on its
site. Users of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and devices built on  Google
Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software can still get their New York Times news
through dedicated apps.  RIM is fighting to stay relevant to U.S. consumers after
sales in the country fell 47 percent last year. The company’s
share of the U.S. smartphone market shrank to 12 percent in the
first quarter, from 16 percent in the previous three months,
according to research firm  ComScore Inc.  Google’s Android
accounted for 51 percent, while Apple had 31 percent.  Google said in November it would stop supporting its Gmail
application for BlackBerry devices.  RIM dropped 1.7 percent to $6.81 at the close today in New
York. The stock has lost 95 percent of its value since reaching
a closing high in 2008 of $147.55.  RIM offers its users more than 2,100 news and information
apps to BlackBerry users and RIM’s base of BlackBerry software
suppliers grew 157 percent last year, Marty Mallick, vice
president of global alliance and business development, said in
an e-mailed statement.  “Applications and content are strategic areas in which RIM
continues to invest as we work to build the future of the
BlackBerry platform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
