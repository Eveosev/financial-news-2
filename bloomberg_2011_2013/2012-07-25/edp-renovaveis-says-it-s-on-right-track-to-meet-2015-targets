EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the renewable-
energy unit of Portuguese utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA,
said it’s on the “right track” to meet targets set for 2015.  The company is “on track to achieve short and long-term
strategic targets,” the unit of Lisbon-based EDP said today in
a regulatory filing.  The wind farm operator in May said it aims to reach
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of
1.35 billion to 1.5 billion euros in 2015. EDP Renovaveis plans
to spend 3.2 billion euros through 2015 as it adds 2.3 gigawatts
of wind generation, including 500 megawatts this year, in
markets such as Poland, Romania and  Brazil .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
