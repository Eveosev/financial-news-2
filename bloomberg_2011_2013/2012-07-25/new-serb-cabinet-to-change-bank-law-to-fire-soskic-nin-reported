Serbia’s new government will seek to
amend the central bank law to enable it to dismiss central bank
governor Dejan Soskic, NIN weekly magazine reported, citing an
unnamed minister in the new Cabinet.  The new government is due to be sworn in tomorrow and it
will take “a week or two” to amend the central bank law,
according to NIN. Changes to the central bank law will simplify
procedures to replace the governor. Soskic will be replaced by
Jorgovanka Tabakovic, vice-president of the Serbian Progressive
Party, NIN said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
