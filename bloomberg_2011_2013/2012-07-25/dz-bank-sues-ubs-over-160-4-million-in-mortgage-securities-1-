UBS AG (UBS)  was sued in New York by  DZ
Bank  AG, Germany’s largest cooperative lender, which claimed
fraud over $160.4 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities.  DZ Bank, based in Frankfurt, sued today in state  Supreme
Court  in Manhattan seeking damages for claims including fraud,
fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation.  “Plaintiffs did not know the true facts regarding
defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions in the offering
materials, and justifiably relied on those misrepresentations
and omissions,” according to court papers. “Defendants’
wrongdoing has led directly to plaintiffs’ damages, which
include loss of market value on the securities.”  Christiaan Brakman, a New York-based spokesman for Zurich-
based UBS, declined to comment on the lawsuit.  DZ Bank has also sued Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and HSBC Holdings Plc in the same court this year over
residential mortgage-backed securities.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s.  The housing market collapsed, and the crisis swept up
lenders and investment banks as the market for the securities
evaporated.  The case is Deutsche Zentral Genossenschaftsbank AG v.  UBS
AG (UBSN) , 652575/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
