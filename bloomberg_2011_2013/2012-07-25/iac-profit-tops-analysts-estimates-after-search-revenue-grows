IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI) , the operator of
websites such as Match.com and Ask.com, rose the most in five
months after a surge in Internet queries on its sites helped
second-quarter profit beat estimates.  The  shares  gained 6 percent to a record $51.18 at the close
in New York. The New York-based company’s stock has climbed 20
percent this year.  The company, founded by billionaire  Barry Diller , saw
revenue from its search business climb 46 percent to $348.8
million. Investors have been intent on the company expanding in
that market, where Ask.com plays a small role compared with
 Google Inc. (GOOG) , said Victor Anthony, an analyst with Topeka Capital
Markets Inc. in New York.  “It’s extremely important,” Anthony said before the
results were released. “They’re seeing more traffic from people
who are looking for an alternative to Google.”  Excluding some items, earnings rose to 86 cents a share
from 62 cents a year earlier, IAC said today in a statement.
Analysts had projected 71 cents on average, according to  data
compiled by Bloomberg . Revenue climbed 40 percent to $680.6
million.  Second-quarter  net income  rose 2.1 percent to $43.3
million, or 47 cents, from $42.4 million, or 44 cents, a year
earlier. The company also reported a 53 percent rise in online-
dating revenue, with Match.com and related sites posting sales
of $178.4 million.  Website queries rose 38 percent to 7.26 billion, while paid
subscribers to dating sites increased 45 percent to 2.79
million. IAC’s ServiceMagic business, which helps users find
contractors, also had gains.  In its media unit, IAC recently gained a controlling stake
in Newsweek/Daily Beast Co., a company formed last year from the
merger of an online startup and  Newsweek magazine . IAC owned
half of the company until the trust of late billionaire  Sidney Harman  stopped making contributions, diluting its stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
