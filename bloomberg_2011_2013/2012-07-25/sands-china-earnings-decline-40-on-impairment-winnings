Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Hong Kong-
listed unit of billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ’s Las Vegas company,
reported a 40 percent drop in second-quarter profit on an
impairment charge, lower winnings and opening costs.  Net income dropped to $160.5 million from $267.4 million  a
year earlier, according to a  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) ’s filing
prepared in U.S. GAAP standard today. Revenue increased to $1.48
billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.  Sands  China  booked an exceptional loss of $100.8 million
for the capital expenditure it spent on two plots of land in
Macau, Parcel 7 and 8. Macau officials in 2010 rejected the
casino operator’s application to develop the plots and the
company last month withdrew its appeal of that decision.  Growth is slowing in the world’s largest gaming hub as
high-stake gamblers, or the VIPs who contribute more than 70
percent of Macau’s revenue, cut back spending amid a weaker
Chinese economy. Smaller Wynn Macau Ltd. reported a drop in
revenue for the second quarter.  The stock dropped 5.2 percent to HK$21.10 at 9:54 a.m. in
 Hong Kong  trading. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  lost 0.16
percent.  Growth in gambling revenue in the world’s largest gambling
hub has slowed, rising 7.3 percent in May, the weakest pace
since July 2009. Even though Macau’s gambling revenue increased
12.2 percent in June to 23.3 billion patacas ($2.9 billion), it
still lagged the 15.3 percent median estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Shares in Sands China have risen 1.4 percent this year,
compared with a 2.4 percent gain of the benchmark Hang Seng
Index. The stock fell 2.8 percent to close at HK$22.25
yesterday, before the earnings announcement.  Macau Extension  Sands China last week was given a three-year extension to
build its fifth property in Macau after Sands Macau, The
Venetian Macau, The Four Seasons Hotel Macau and Sands Cotai
Central. The company will pay a penalty of 900,000 patacas for
the delay in developing a plot called Parcel 3, where it will
build the newest resort.  Sands China looks to begin construction on Parcel 3 by
November, and the new project will target the mass-market and
feature “family-oriented” facilities, according to a press
statement.  The Parcel 3 resort would boost the company’s presence on
Cotai, a strip of reclaimed land where casino operators
including  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883) ,  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , and
 MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) , are awaiting land grants or approvals
from the government to start their integrated resort projects.
Sands China opened the first phase of Cotai Central in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
