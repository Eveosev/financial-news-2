China ’s land ministry said it faces
a greater challenge to prevent a rebound in illegal land use in
the second half of 2012 as the nation starts key construction
projects to stabilize economic growth.  Illegal use of land is rising by area this year, with about
30 percent of cases discovered in the first half reported in
June, Yue Xiaowu, deputy head of  law enforcement  at the Ministry
of Land and Resources, said in an online briefing today. The
 transcript  was posted on the ministry’s website.  China seeks to prevent the conversion of farmland to other
uses.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
