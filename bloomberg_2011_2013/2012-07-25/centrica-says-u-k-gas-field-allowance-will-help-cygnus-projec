Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.’s largest
residential-energy supplier, said tax relief for natural-gas
drilling will bolster its Cygnus project in the  North Sea .  The development, which Centrica says is the biggest gas
discovery in the southern North Sea for 25 years, will create
4,000 jobs and supply about 5 percent of the nation’s energy at
peak production, according to a company statement. The project
needs 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) of investment, it said.  The government today said gas drillers will get a credit
valued at 500 million pounds as the U.K. promotes the use of the
fuel and cuts support for renewable energy. The Department of
Energy and Climate Change lowered subsidies for onshore wind by
10 percent, offered less financial support than expected for
biomass projects and said it may further reduce aid for solar.  “As the U.K. becomes increasingly dependent on imported
gas, today’s announcement represents a significant boost to the
U.K.’s long-term energy security as well as creating much needed
jobs,” Centrica Chief Executive Officer Sam Laidlaw said in a
statement.  The Treasury said the government will this year publish a
strategy to ensure drillers get long-term commitments on tax
breaks for tapping natural gas. The 500 million-pound incentive
seeks to spur investment in large gas fields in shallow waters.  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, a partner in Cygnus, also welcomed the plans.
Bayerngas GmbH is the other partner in the development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
