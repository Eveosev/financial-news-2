Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index headed for a four-day loss, amid concern
Europe’s crisis is worsening and as the  International Monetary
Fund  said  China’s economy  faces significant downside risks.
Suppliers to  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  tumbled after the company reported
earnings that missed estimates.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , an operator of ports and retail
chains that gets 55 percent of its  revenue  in Europe, fell 1.6
percent in  Hong Kong . Toshiba Corp. paced losses among Apple
suppliers.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer
electronics, dropped to the lowest since 1980 after a report
showed Japan had an unexpected  trade surplus  in June. Gome
Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd., China’s second-biggest
electronics retailer, plunged to an all-time low in Hong Kong
after forecasting a first-half loss.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.9 percent to 112.99
as of 8:58 p.m. in Tokyo, headed for the lowest close since June
12. About three stocks dropped for each that rose, with eight
out of the measure’s 10 industries declining. Measures of
volatility increased across the region.  “Signals coming out of Greece are not positive in terms of
implementing agreements, and so Europe is going to remain a key
negative for markets for quite some time to come,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment markets research at
Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which oversees
about $150 billion. “The outlook remains very difficult for
major economies and therefore for equity markets.”  Valuation Comparison  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell about 12 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern China’s
economy is slowing and Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will
worsen. The regional benchmark index traded at 11.6 times
 estimated earnings  as of yesterday, compared with 12.9 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 10.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 1.4 percent.
South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  lost 1.4 percent, and  Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  fell 0.2 percent after a report showed
consumer prices rose in line with estimates last quarter. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index pared its retreat to 0.1 percent. The
Shanghai Composite Index decreased 0.5 percent.  The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  climbed 0.1 percent to 22.73, the
highest since June 19, indicating options traders expect a swing
of 6.5 percent in the benchmark over the next 30 days. Gauges of
anticipated price movements for Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Korea’s
Kospi 200 Index rose more than 5 percent.  Exporters to Europe fell as Greece Prime Minister Antonis
Samaras is scheduled to meet with European Commission President
 Jose Barroso  in Athens this week before seeing the “troika” of
officials representing the euro area, the  European Central Bank 
and the IMF on July 27.  Crisis Creep  Eastern European economies will expand at half last year’s
pace in 2012 as fallout from the euro-area debt crisis spreads,
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said today.  Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.6 percent to HK$67.30 in Hong
Kong.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker that gets 31
percent of its revenue in Europe, fell 0.9 percent to 2,678 yen.  Japanese exporters also fell after data showed the nation
had a trade surplus of 61.7 billion yen ($790 million) in June.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated a deficit of 140
billion yen. Sony dropped 5.2 percent to 870 yen, the lowest
close since 1980.  Valuations Ignored  Of the 1,007 companies in the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index,
about 35 percent have price-to-book ratios of less than one,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Those companies include
Japan’s Honda Motor Co., Singapore Airlines Ltd., Australian oil
explorer Origin Energy Ltd. and Hutchison Whampoa. A value below
one means a company can be bought for less than the value of its
assets.  “Investors continue to run away from Europe,” said Goya Nakao, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa
Asset Management Co., which oversees about 5 trillion yen.
“Stocks and sectors that are highly dependent on external
demand just keep falling. Sentiment has deteriorated so much
that investors are ignoring cheap valuations and selling to cut
their losses.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  gained 0.4
percent today after falling as much as 0.7 percent. Apple’s
profit and sales  missed  projections for only the second time
since 2003 as customers held off on iPhone purchases while
waiting for a new model to be introduced later in the year. The
S&P index dropped 0.9 percent in New York yesterday.  Toshiba Plunges  Apple suppliers declined across the region. Toshiba Corp.,
a supplier of chips for Apple’s iPad, slumped 7.3 percent to 242
yen, the lowest since 2009.  Catcher Technology Co. (2474) , a casing
maker of iPhones, slid 2.1 percent to NT$165.5 in Taiwan.
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , South Korea’s biggest exporter of
consumer electronics, dropped 1 percent to 1.158 million won.  Earnings have  missed  analyst estimates for 51 percent of
the 67 firms listed on the Asia-Pacific index that have reported
quarterly results this month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Gome Electrical Appliances plunged 14 percent to an all-
time low of 66 Hong Kong cents after forecasting a first-half
loss on lower sales and losses at its e-commerce unit. The
retailer reported an 88 percent profit decline in the first
quarter as  China  stopped subsidizing some home appliance
purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
