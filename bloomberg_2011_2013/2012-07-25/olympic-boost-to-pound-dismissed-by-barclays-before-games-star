An influx of Olympic Games visitors
to the U.K. won’t help to lift Britain’s pound if history is any
guide, Barclays Plc said.  “The Olympics will be an important event but they aren’t
going to have an impact on sterling,” Sara Yates, a foreign-
exchange strategist in London, said by phone today. “Looking at
past Olympics, it is not clear that sentiment has been boosted
enough to lift the currency. Also the Olympics is going to cause
disruption and that could offset any positives.”  The pound slipped a fourth day against the dollar to
$1.5472 at 2:20 p.m. in London, after the  Office for National
Statistics  said U.K. gross domestic product fell 0.7 percent in
the second quarter. While the 2012 London Olympic Games start in
two days, they probably won’t boost tourist demand, trade,
sentiment or economic conditions enough to support the pound,
Yates said.  “You are going to have an increase in numbers of people
visiting the economy, but sterling is the fourth most liquid
currency so it seems unlikely that would have an impact,” Yates
said. Historical analysis of previous games also suggests the
currency won’t be affected through the other channels, she said.  Barclays forecasts the U.K. currency will depreciate to
$1.53 over 12 months, Yates said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
