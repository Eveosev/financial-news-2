Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
most popular search engine, said less than half of the $12.4
billion it paid for Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. was devoted
to patents and technology.  Of the total, $5.5 billion was attributed to patents and
“developed technology,” Google wrote in a  filing  today with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Another $2.6
billion relates to goodwill, which Google defined as the
financial benefit it expects to derive from the acquisition.  The Motorola Mobility acquisition, which closed in May,
shores up Google’s patent portfolio to help it combat legal
challenges against the Android mobile operating system. Motorola
Mobility, which has more than 17,000 patents, also helps Google
enter the hardware market to compete more directly with  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  and other smartphone manufacturers.  “The acquisition is expected to protect and advance our
Android ecosystem and enhance competition in mobile computing,”
the company said in the filing.  Google also said $730 million of the acquisition price
reflected customer relationships and $670 million was related to
other assets. The company also acquired $2.9 billion in cash.  Google, based in  Mountain View , California, fell 1.3
percent to $607.57 at the close in New York. The shares have
 fallen  5.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
