Former Bayerische Landesbank
management board members charged over the purchase of Hypo-Alpe-
Adria Bank International AG were partly exonerated by an expert
witness,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung   reported .  The financial expert, commissioned by the Munich court that
has to decide whether the case may go to trial, opposes the
prosecutors’ view that BayernLB paid too much when it bought
Hypo Alpe in 2007 for 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion), the
newspaper reported, citing the expert’s written opinion.  The former managers only failed when they bought an
additional 3.33 percent in the Austrian lender for 109 million
euros half a year later because at the time the financial crisis
had hit, warranting a lower price, SZ cited the expert as
saying.  Among the eight former managers charged in the case are ex-
head Werner Schmidt, and  Michael Kemmer , now the head of the
Association of German Banks. All have denied wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
