Greenland’s ice sheet melted over a
larger area earlier this month for several days than at any time
in more than three decades,  NASA  said.  Satellites observed that almost all of the ice covering
Greenland melted to some degree at the surface, NASA said in a
statement yesterday on its  website . About half of the surface of
Greenland’s ice sheet melts naturally during the summer, with
most of the water refreezing at high elevations, NASA said.  “This year the extent of ice melting at or near the
surface jumped dramatically,” the statement showed. “According
to satellite data, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet
surface thawed at some point in mid-July.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
