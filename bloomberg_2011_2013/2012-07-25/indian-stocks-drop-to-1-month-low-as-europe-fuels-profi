Indian stocks fell to a one-month
low amid concern slowing economic growth will hurt corporate
earnings already threatened by  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP)  slipped to its lowest price in
three years after profit slumped.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the
biggest engineering company, retreated for a fourth day. The BSE
 India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  dropped 0.4 percent to 16,846.05, the
lowest close since June 18.  India’s economic expansion slowed to a near-decade low in
the March quarter from a year ago as the debt crisis in Europe,
its top trading partner, curbed exports and a policy gridlock
deterred investments. Six of 12, or 50 percent, of companies on
the Sensex that have posted June-quarter earnings have trailed
estimates, compared with 30 percent in the March quarter and 47
percent three months earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Growth will decelerate this year in India and the other BRIC
nations, the  International Monetary Fund  said July 16.  “For 2013 we’re looking at 9 percent earnings growth in
the Sensex companies and about 11 percent for 2014,” compared
with an average 33 percent annually between 2004 and 2008, said
Sanjeev Prasad, senior executive director and co-head of Kotak
Institutional Equities, in an interview to Bloomberg UTV today.
“You have seen a big downshift in the earnings numbers and that
comes from the fact that your GDP growth itself is slowing
dramatically. We have 6 percent growth in GDP for the current
year and I don’t think it is going to be higher in 2014.”  Worst Performer  Jindal Steel sank 4.6 percent to 395.8 rupees, the lowest
close since July 2009, after first-quarter profit unexpectedly
declined because of an impairment charge on an investment in
 Bolivia .  Net income  sank 58 percent to 3.9 billion rupees. The
stock is the  worst performer  today on the Sensex.  Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) , India’s biggest iron-ore exporter, dropped
1.6 percent to 183 rupees after reporting first-quarter net
income that missed estimates late yesterday. Group  net income 
increased 15 percent to 9.64 billion rupees ($172 million). The
median profit estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
9.8 billion rupees.  Spanish two-year bond yields surged to a euro-era record,
prompting policy makers to deny an international bailout was
being prepared. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  and
Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said that  Spain ’s
borrowing costs don’t reflect the strength of its economy as
they pledged to work toward deeper integration to fight the debt
crisis. The European Union accounted for 17.2 percent of India’s
exports in the six months during April to September 2011, data
from the commerce ministry show.  Fund Flows  The Sensex has still gained 9 percent this year, bolstered
by foreign  funds  who have invested a net $10.2 billion in local
equities since Jan. 1, the highest in  Asia  and a record for the
period. The flows have increased on speculation the government
will revive its economic reforms agenda to bolster an economy
growing at the weakest pace in almost a decade.  The Sensex trades at 13.2 times estimated earnings, lower
than its three-year average multiple of 16.6.  China ’s Shanghai
Composite Index has fallen 13 percent from this year’s high on
March 2 to trade near its lowest level since March 2009 amid
concern the economic slowdown is deepening. The Chinese gauge
trades at 9.5 times estimated profit, compared with the average
of 17.5 since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2006.  “India is not a very cheap market despite all the talk of
gloom and doom,” Kotak’s Prasad said. “China, which is facing
challenges as far as economic slowdown is concerned, is trading
at below 9 times, which is a lot more attractive than the 13.5
times where India is trading currently. If we don’t implement
some of the important reforms which people are expecting, the
market will go down.”  Opposition  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh , who took control of the
 finance ministry  in June, has pledged to revive an economic
reforms agenda stymied by opposition from its own allies. The
government last year suspended a plan to allow  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  and other foreign companies to open supermarkets, while an
anti-corruption bill and proposals to allow foreign investment
in aviation and pensions are also stalled.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the  S&P CNX Nifty (NIFTY)  Index, fell 1.3 percent to 16.75.
The Nifty index lost 0.4 percent to 5,109.60. The BSE-200 Index
declined 0.4 percent. Combined volume on the nation’s top two
bourses was 725 million shares yesterday, 19 percent less than
the 12-month daily average of 899 million shares.  Overseas investors sold a net 2.11 billion rupees ($37.7
million) of local stocks yesterday, the first withdrawal in 17
days, paring their investment in equities this year to 516
billion rupees, data from the market regulator show.  Reliance, owner of the world’s biggest oil-refining
complex, lost 0.7 percent to 719.25 rupees. Larsen & Toubro lost
1 percent to 1,341.85 rupees.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the
world’s second-largest consumer goods company, decreased 2.5
percent to 464.45 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
