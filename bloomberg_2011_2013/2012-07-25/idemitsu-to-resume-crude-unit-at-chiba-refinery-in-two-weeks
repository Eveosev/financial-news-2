Idemitsu Kosan Co. (5019)  plans to resume
the No. 2 crude distillation unit at its Chiba refinery near
 Tokyo  in about two weeks, said a company official who declined
to be identified because of internal policy.  The 220,000 barrel-a-day CDU was shut on July 19 after a
fire started near the naphtha circulation lines at the facility.
The company kept some of its secondary units running after the
CDU was halted, the official said, without specifying the
equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
