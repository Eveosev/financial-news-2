The Treasury’s $35 billion sale of
five-year notes may draw a record low  yield  of 0.582 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in July 2017, yielded 0.578
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.752 percent at
the previous offering on June 27. The record auction low was
0.748 percent in May. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York  time.  The size of the offering is the same as at the past 22
five-year note sales after peaking at $42 billion from November
2009 through April 2010.  The June auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.61,
down from 2.99 in May. The average ratio for the past 10
auctions is 2.96.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 35.1 percent of the notes at the
June sale after purchasing 42.6 percent in May. The average for
the past 10 offerings is 44.3 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 10.7 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 10.9
percent at the past 10.  Five-year notes have returned 2.3 percent this year,
compared with a 3.2 percent gain by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-
year securities returned 9.2 percent in 2011, while Treasuries
overall gained 9.8 percent.  Second Offering  Today’s offering is the second of three this week totaling
$99 billion. The government will sell $29 billion in seven-year
securities tomorrow. Yesterday’s auction of $35 billion in two-
year notes  yielded  a record low 0.22 percent.  This week’s note offerings, combined with the July 19
auction of $15 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, will raise $60.6 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $53.4 billion.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
