Shelbyzyme LLC, the owner of a
patent used to treat organ-destroying Fabry disease, won
$50 million from Genzyme Corp. after a  jury trial .  Genzyme, a unit of France’s  Sanofi (SAN)  based in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, encouraged and contributed to the infringement of
Leonia, New Jersey-based Shelbyzyme’s 2006 patent, jurors in
federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, found on July 17,
according to electronic court documents.  Genzyme was “not licensed or otherwise authorized” to use
the recombinant DNA therapy for Fabry patients and used it
anyway, Shelbyzyme said.  Fabry disease affects 1 in as many as 60,000 males and
fewer females, according to the National Institutes of Health
website on  genetic conditions . The inherited disease results
from a buildup of fat in organs and cells, causing pain,
splotching, digestive distress and potential organ failure.  “We disagree with the jury verdict” and may appeal,  Bo Piela , a Genzyme spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Charles Emanuel, an attorney for Shelbyzyme, didn’t
immediately reply to an e-mail seeking comment on the verdict.  The technology in the patent was developed by City
University of  New York  researchers David Calhoun and George
Coppola, according to court papers.  The case is Shelbyzyme v. Genzyme, 09-cv-768, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 7,011,831.  To contact the reporters on this story:
