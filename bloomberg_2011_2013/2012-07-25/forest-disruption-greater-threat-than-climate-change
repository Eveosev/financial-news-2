Deforestation of protected areas and
illegal hunting of endangered species that live there has a
greater impact on biodiversity than  climate change , overfishing
and the degradation of coral reefs, according to a researcher.  The “rapid disruption” of protected tropical forests is
the greatest threat to wildlife,  Bill Laurance , a professor at
James Cook University in Cairns,  Australia , said in an e-mail.
He studied 60 protected areas in tropical regions around the
world and is the lead author of an article that will be
published in tomorrow’s issue of  Nature .  Tropical forests are the most diverse ecosystems on Earth,
and failing to maintain them may drive more species to
extinction, he said. To serve as a sanctuary for wildlife, the
areas must also be protected from nearby development and other
activities in adjacent lands that will have impact on designated
preserves.  “We can’t just draw lines on the map to designate a
protected area,” Laurance said. “We also have to protect
reserves against encroachment, illegal hunting and other
pressures that can infiltrate from outside.”  About half of the areas studied “are doing reasonably
well,” while Laurance classified the others as “suffering.”
Many of the hardest-hit protected areas receive little, if any,
on-the-ground support, he said. The degraded areas are still
valuable because of their potential to capture carbon or provide
watershed protection.  “It’s a mistake to preach despair,” he said. “We have to
make protected areas work in the tropics -- we just don’t have a
choice.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
