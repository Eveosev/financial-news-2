The pound slumped the most in six
months against the euro after a U.K. report showed the economy
shrank more than analysts forecast last quarter.  Two-year gilt yields fell to an all-time low as the data
fueled speculation the  Bank of England  will increase asset
purchases to reignite growth after boosting them by 50 billion
pounds ($77.4 billion) at its July meeting. The U.K. currency
weakened against all except two of its 16 major counterparts as
a survey compiled by the  Confederation of British Industry 
showed U.K. manufacturing confidence dropped in July.  “We were primed for a poor number but this is dreadful,”
said Nick Parsons, head of research for the U.K. and  Europe  at
 National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  in  London . “We forecast a cut in
U.K. interest rates by the end of the year and more quantitative
easing is going to be needed,” he said, referring to central
bank asset purchases.  The pound tumbled 0.7 percent to 78.35 pence per euro at
4:28 p.m. London time after falling as much as 1 percent, the
biggest intraday decline since Jan. 12. The U.K. currency rose
to 77.55 pence on July 20, the strongest since October 2008.
Sterling fell 0.3 percent to $1.5467.  Gross domestic product shrank 0.7 percent from the first
quarter, when it contracted 0.3 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a 0.2
percent decline. A quarterly gauge of factory optimism fell to
minus 6 from 22 in April, the CBI said. Hiring intentions slid
to minus 2 from 16, the lowest since October.  The U.K. currency has fallen 0.4 percent in the past week,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar gained 0.9 percent,
and the yen jumped 1.7 percent.  Euro Boost  The euro was boosted today after European Central Bank
council member Ewald Nowotny said there were arguments in favor
of giving the region’s rescue fund a banking license in order to
increase its firepower.  Moody’s Investors Service cut its outlook for the U.K.
credit rating to negative on Feb. 13, saying Britain risked
losing its top grade if the economy deteriorates. Fitch lowered
its outlook for the nation to negative on March 14.  “As long as the U.K. data continues to disappoint, we see
risks for a sterling downside correction increasing,” said
 Valentin Marinov , head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy
at Citigroup Inc. in London. “One of the key reasons why people
have been buying gilts was the AAA rating of the U.K. sovereign.
If that’s gone, it could undermine sterling.”  Record Low  The two-year  gilt  yield dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 0.07 percent after falling to a record
0.047 percent. The 2.25 percent note due in March 2014 advanced
0.02, or 20 pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to 103.53.  The 10-year bond yield declined one basis point to 1.46
percent after sliding as much as three basis points. It set an
all-time low of 1.407 percent on July 23.  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee raised its
asset-purchase target to 375 billion pounds on July 5 and said
the purchases will take four months to complete. The next policy
decision will be announced on Aug. 2.  U.K. government debt has returned 4.2 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds
advanced 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
