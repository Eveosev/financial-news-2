European soccer champion Chelsea
said it signed Brazil midfielder Oscar from Internacional.  Oscar, 20, whose full name is Oscar dos Santos Emboaba
Junior, is in the Brazil squad for the 2012 London Olympics and
played in the 2-0 defeat of Great Britain last week.  Chelsea didnâ€™t reveal financial details although the  Daily
Telegraph  said yesterday the transfer fee is as much as 25
million pounds ($38.7 million).  Oscar joins Eden Hazard and Marko Marin among new arrivals
at  Stamford  Bridge for next season. In Brazil he played for Sao
Paulo and Porto Alegre-based Internacional.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
