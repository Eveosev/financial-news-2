  European (SXXP)  stocks retreated for a
fourth day as reports showed the U.K. economy shrank the most in
three years last quarter and U.S. new-house sales unexpectedly
dropped last month.  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  slid 3.3 percent after the U.K.’s largest
fixed-line phone company posted falling sales.  Drax Group Plc (DRX) 
tumbled 15 percent after the U.K. government revised its
subsidies for renewable energy.  Daimler AG (DAI)  jumped 4.1 percent
after forecasting that operating profit will not drop in 2012.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.1 percent to 250.39 at
the close of trading. The benchmark measure has  slipped 4.4
percent over the last four days  on concern that  Greece  will
default and more Spanish regions will follow Valencia in seeking
a bailout from the central government.  “The U.K. gross domestic product number was a bit of a
startler,” said  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist at Brewin
Dolphin Securities Ltd. in London. “After three quarters of
negative growth, the U.K.’s now firmly in the European camp of
stagnation. Decent earnings results, particularly from the big
international companies, are providing some support.”  In the U.K.,  the economy  shrank the most since 2009 in the
second quarter, deepening the country’s double-dip recession.
 Gross domestic product  fell 0.7 percent from the first quarter,
the  Office for National Statistics  said today. Economists had
forecast a 0.2 percent drop, according to the  median of 36
estimates  in a Bloomberg News survey.  Business Confidence  In Germany, a  gauge of business confidence  slipped in July
to the lowest level since March 2010. The Ifo institute’s
 business climate index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives,
dropped to 103.3 from 105.2 in June.  Greece’s Prime Minister, Antonis Samaras, will meet with
representatives of the European Commission, the  European Central
Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  -- the so-called troika
-- on July 27, amid concern the country will fail to abide by
the commitments needed to obtain continued financial aid.  Yields on Spain’s two-year notes  rose to as much as 7.15
percent earlier today, climbing above 7 percent for the first
time since the single currency came into being.  In the U.S.,  sales of new houses  dropped in June from a
two-year high. Purchases decreased to a 350,000 annual rate,
down 8.4 percent from May and the weakest since January, the
Commerce Department reported today in  Washington . The  median
estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of 74 economists was 372,000.  China Economy  China’s slowing economy faces significant risks and relies
too much on investment, the IMF said in  an annual review . The
Washington-based lender repeated an assessment that the  yuan  is
“moderately” undervalued, and urged leaders to increase
consumption and channel citizens’ savings away from housing.  National benchmark indexes rose in 14 of the 18 western-
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index fell less than 0.1
percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index gained 0.2 percent.
Germany’s DAX Index climbed 0.3 percent.  BT slid 3.3 percent to 210.2 pence, its biggest retreat in
six weeks, after reporting fiscal first-quarter sales of 4.48
billion pounds ($6.9 billion). That missed the  average analyst
estimate  of 4.58 billion pounds in a Bloomberg News survey.  Drax Group, the owner of the U.K.’s largest coal-fired
electricity plant, tumbled 15 percent to 442 pence, its biggest
plunge since at least 2005. The Department of Energy and Climate
Change revised its subsidies for renewable energy, offering less
financial support than predicted for generators planning to
switch to burning low-carbon fuel.  GlaxoSmithKline  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  slid 1.3 percent to 1,426.5 pence after
cutting its  sales forecast  for the year. The London-based
company reported second-quarter core earnings per share of 26.4
pence, lower than the average analyst estimate of 26.8 pence.  Informa Plc fell 5.3 percent to 350.4 pence. The publisher
of Lloyd’s List posted a first-half loss compared with a profit
a year earlier as it sold events businesses in Hungary,  Austria ,
the  Czech Republic  and parts of Germany.  Daimler advanced 4.1 percent to 37.62 euros after saying
 second-quarter sales  increased 10 percent to 28.9 billion euros
($35 billion). The world’s third-largest maker of luxury cars
also posted earnings before interest and taxes of 2.24 billion
euros, in line with the 2.2 billion-euro  average of analyst
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Lonza Group AG (LONN)  jumped 3.7 percent to 45.50 Swiss francs
after saying first-half Ebit increased 24 percent to 168 million
