Spain cut the outlook for soft-wheat
and barley production this year after the country had its
fourth-hottest June since 1960 and less rain than usual. The
government predicted a bigger corn crop.  The soft-wheat harvest is forecast to slide 22 percent to
4.63 million metric tons, compared with a previous forecast for
production of 4.91 million tons, the  Agriculture Ministry  wrote
in a  report  on its website today.  June was “extremely warm,” with temperatures on average
at 22.7 degrees Celsius (72.9 degrees Fahrenheit) and rainfall
that was 56 percent of normal, the ministry reported on July 4.
That followed below-normal rain in May, a wetter-than-usual
April and the driest December-to-February period since at least
1947, according to ministry data.  Spain’s barley crop is expected to slide 31 percent to 5.79
million tons, from a previous outlook of 6.07 million tons. The
forecasts are based on the situation as of June 30.  Farmers will harvest 4.26 million tons of corn, 2.5 percent
more than the 4.15 million tons in 2011 after planting increased
4.8 percent, the ministry wrote.  Spain  is the European Union’s
biggest corn importer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
