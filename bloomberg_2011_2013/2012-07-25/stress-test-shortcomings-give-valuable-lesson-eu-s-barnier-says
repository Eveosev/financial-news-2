Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial services chief, said that the bloc can learn from
shortcomings in last year’s round of EU-wide bank stress tests.  “Valuable lessons” can be drawn from the 2011 exams,
Barnier said in a written response to a parliamentary question.
“If the European financial system is to be credible and
stable, all supervisors will have to systematically work
together in a more coordinated and constructive way.”  The stress tests were carried out by the European Banking
Authority, a London-based agency that coordinates the work of
national regulators in the 27-nation EU. The exams have been
criticized for failing to reveal weaknesses in the bloc’s banks,
notably in  Spain , which last month sought a euro area bail-out
of its financial industry.  Possible improvements to stress tests “in particular”
include “the need for greater engagement with banks and
national supervisors and further strengthening of the
methodology,” Barnier said in  his answer , published on the
European Parliament’s website.  Barnier said the European Commission “has no doubts about
the relevance and effectiveness of EBA.” The authority had 64
members of staff at the end of May, Barnier said in his response
dated July 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
