The  U.S. Senate  cleared legislation
requiring President  Barack Obama  to report to Congress on his
administrationâ€™s plans for automatic spending cuts scheduled to
take effect in January.  The bill, passed unanimously today, would require the Obama
administration to detail within 30 days of enactment how it
would implement the 10 percent cuts in defense and 8 percent
cuts in non-defense domestic programs.  The House passed the measure, H.R. 5872, on a 414-2 vote on
July 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
