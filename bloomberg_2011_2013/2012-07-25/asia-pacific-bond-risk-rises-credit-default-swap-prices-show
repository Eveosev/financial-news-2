The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 5 basis points to 179 basis
points as of 8:31 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is headed for the highest close
since June 28, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index gained 3 basis points to
187 basis points as of 10:17 a.m. in Sydney, National Australia
Bank Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is also poised to rise to
the highest level since June 28, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 3 basis points to 189
basis points as of 9:29 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index is set to reach the highest level since June 8,
CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
