The  Los Angeles Dodgers  will acquire
three-time All-Star shortstop Hanley Ramirez from the  Miami
Marlins  as part of a four-player trade,  MLB.com reports , citing
an unidentified Major League Baseball official.  The Dodgers also get left-handed relief pitcher Randy Choate from the Marlins for starting pitcher Nathan Eovaldi and
minor-league pitcher Scott McGough, MLB.com said. The Dodgers
will pick up almost $40 million in contract obligations as part
of the deal, according to MLB.com.  Ramirez, 28, is a former batting champion and National
League rookie of the year who is hitting .246 with 14 home runs
and 47 runs batted in this season. A career .300 hitter, Ramirez
batted a career-low .243 last season, when he missed two months
because of a shoulder injury before having surgery.  Ramirez has three years left on a six-year deal that is set
to pay him $15 million this season, $15 million in 2013 and $16
million in 2014. He would take over at shortstop in  Los Angeles 
until Dee Gordon returns from the disabled list in a month and
then may move to third base, MLB.com said.  The Dodgers have a 53-45 record and are 2 1/2 games behind
the first-place  San Francisco Giants  in the NL Western Division,
while the Marlins are 45-52 and in fourth place in the NL East.
MLBâ€™s trade deadline is July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
