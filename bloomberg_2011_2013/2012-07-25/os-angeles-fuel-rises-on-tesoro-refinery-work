Los Angeles  gasoline fell for a
second day after the  California Energy Commission  said
inventories jumped 10 percent last week and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s El
Segundo refinery was said to start a coker compressor.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, supplies rose to 5.32
million barrels in the week ended July 20, up from 4.83 million
a week earlier, the state Energy Commission said in an e-mailed
report. Carbob production also increased 6.2 percent to 6.55
million barrels, the state said.  Chevron’s 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo refinery, the
largest in the state, started a compressor at the coker unit
after a failure today, a person familiar with operations at the
plant said. The equipment tripped offline briefly, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  California-blend, or Carbob,  gasoline  in Los Angeles
dropped 1.62 cents to a premium of 5.38 cents a gallon against
gasoline futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange,
data compiled by Bloomberg shows. The same fuel in San Francisco
fell 3.12 cents to 0.88 cent above gasoline futures.  California-blend diesel, or CARB diesel, in Los Angeles was
unchanged at a premium of 5.25 cents a gallon versus heating oil
futures traded on the Nymex. CARB diesel in San Francisco was
also unchanged at 3 cents a gallon above futures.  CARB diesel inventories increased 17 percent, or 443,000
barrels, to 3 million last week, the state Energy Commission
said. Production of the fuel also gained 12 percent to 2.15
million, the state said.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
slipped 1.5 cents to a discount of 11 cents a gallon versus
Nymex gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel  there  dropped 3 cents
to 8 cents above heating oil futures.  Gasoline inventories in the U.S. West Coast, known as the
Padd 5 region, fell 1.4 percent to 26.9 million barrels last
week, the Energy Department said. Distillate fuel oil supplies
increased for the third week, climbing 0.5 percent to 12.7
million, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
