Belgian business confidence
unexpectedly increased for the first time in five months in July
as the demand outlook improved in the manufacturing, building
and services industries.  The  confidence index  for  Belgium  rose to minus 11.3 from
minus 13.2 in June, the Brussels-based  National Bank of Belgium 
said in a statement today. Economists had predicted a decline to
minus 13.6, according to the median of 13 estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey .  “In the business-related services, the entrepreneurs
assessed the level of activity more positively, and they are
also optimistic about demand forecasts,” the central bank said.
“In the building industry, the evolution of the order book was
less negative, equipment was more intensively used and the
demand outlook improved.”  The improving sentiment among Belgian executives, which had
dropped to the lowest level since October 2009 a month earlier,
contrasts with declines in German and French business
confidence. German business confidence fell for a third straight
month in July to the lowest reading since March 2010, the Ifo
institute said today.  French confidence  also dropped to the
lowest level since early 2010.  Consumer confidence  in Belgium fell to a  five-month low  in
July amid mounting concerns over the economic outlook and
joblessness, which households expect will reduce their capacity
to save.  To contact the reporters on this story:
