The ruble headed for its lowest
level in two weeks against the dollar after  Russia ’s central
bank announced a less strict system for intervening in support
of its currency and as oil, the country’s main export, declined.  The Russian currency dropped as much as 1 percent before
trading down 0.1 percent at 32.80 per dollar as of 12:25 p.m. in
Moscow. A close at that level would be the weakest since July
10. The ruble lost 0.4 percent to 39.7485 per euro and 0.2
percent to 35.9213 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket.  Bank Rossii widened the band within which it manages the
ruble against the basket to 7 rubles from 6 rubles, according to
a statement late yesterday. The central bank will only sell $450
million in foreign currencies daily to support the ruble before
shifting the band downwards, from a limit of $500 million
previously, it said.  “This is an official invitation to sell the ruble,
compliments of the central bank,”  Benoit Anne , the London-based
head of emerging-market strategy at Societe Generale SA, said by
e-mail yesterday after the statement was published. “They
basically are telling us that a weaker ruble is just fine.”  Urals crude oil slipped 0.1 percent to $103.21 per barrel
after a U.S. report showed crude stockpiles increased for the
first time in four weeks, a sign demand for the commodity may
falter. Oil and gas contribute about 50 percent of Russia’s
state revenue, according to the government’s estimates.  Russia’s 140 billion rubles ($4.3 billion) of local bonds
due August 2016 fell, increasing the yield by 32 basis points,
or 0.32 percentage point, to 8.07 percent. Investors increased
bets on the ruble weakening, with non-deliverable forwards
showing the Russian currency at 33.3338 per dollar in three
months, compared with expectations of 33.3065 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
