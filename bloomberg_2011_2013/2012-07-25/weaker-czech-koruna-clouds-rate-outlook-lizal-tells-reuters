The Czech koruna remains weaker than
the central bank’s forecast, which may influence policy makers’
on whether to cut interest rates further,  Reuters  newswire
reported, citing board member Lubomir Lizal.  The bank’s updated quarterly forecasts, to be published
next week, may show a “slightly” worsening economic outlook,
Reuters cited Lizal as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
