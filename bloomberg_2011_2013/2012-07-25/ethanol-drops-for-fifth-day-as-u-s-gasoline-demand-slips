Ethanol futures fell for a fifth day
on speculation that weaker gasoline demand will slow consumption
of the biofuel.  Futures fell as gasoline  demand  over the four weeks ended
July 20 was 3.1 percent below a year earlier, according to
Energy Department data released today. Demand, which was 8.66
million barrels a day last week, has been below 9 million in 27
of 29 weeks this year.  “Weak gasoline demand is sort of a double whammy,” said
 Sander Cohan , a global transportation fuels analyst and
principal with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts. “It undercuts the price of gasoline and reduces
available volume for blending.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 2.2 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.574 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the lowest settlement since July 13. Prices have gained 17
percent this year.  “Ethanol had room to fall back because demand doesn’t look
that strong for ethanol,” Cohan said. “What’s keeping ethanol
high is the corn, what’s pulling it off is the gasoline
demand.”  Production of the biofuel fell for a sixth straight week,
dropping 0.8 percent to 796,000 barrels a day, the least since
the agency began tracking weekly data in 2010. Inventories
dropped 2.8 percent to 19 million barrels, according to
department data.  Corn Gains  Corn for December delivery advanced 9.75 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $7.88 a bushel in Chicago as the grain-rich Midwest
is mired in a drought. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Distillers are losing 34 cents on each gallon of ethanol
made based on the September contracts for the fuel and corn,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies including
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , Nedak Ethanol LLC,  Green Plains Renewable
Energy Inc. (GPRE)  and  Pacific Ethanol Inc. (PEIX)  have shut down or stopped
production.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 7.5 cents to $2.695 a
gallon in  New York , 4 cents to $2.565 in Chicago, 4.5 cents to
$2.62 on the  Gulf Coast  and 7.5 cents to $2.80 on the West
Coast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
