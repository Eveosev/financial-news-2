The U.K. government published a
consultation outlining proposals for mandatory reporting of
carbon dioxide emissions by publicly listed companies.  The  plans , released today on the website of the Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, outline how the nation
will implement the policy announced last month at the United
Nations Rio+20 conference on sustainability in  Rio de Janeiro .  Defra also published a  consultation  on so-called key
performance indicators, giving guidance to companies on how they
can demonstrate their sustainable practises by reporting on air
pollution, water, use of materials, waste generation and their
effects on ecosystems and wildlife. That consultation places no
new mandatory requirements on businesses, Defra said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
