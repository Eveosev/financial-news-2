Zinc and nickel prices may be the
hardest hit if real estate investment in  China , the top user of
industrial metals, contracts by 2 percent, bringing about a 2.7
percent drop in metals, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  Economic growth in China slowed in the second quarter to
7.6 percent, the weakest pace since 2009. A two percent downturn
in property investment may see metals decline by 2.7 percent
year-on-year, with zinc falling 4.3 percent, nickel 3.7 percent,
lead 3.2 percent and copper 3.1 percent, according to the IMF.  “The impact on overall metal prices could last four
quarters, with up to five to six quarters for lead and zinc,”
the Washington-based fund said in its  annual report on China 
published on its website yesterday.  The IMF’s analysis comes after the official Xinhua News
Agency said on July 20 Beijing wouldn’t ease restrictions on
home purchases and would keep a “firm grip” on the market to
prevent  house prices  rebounding.  Home prices  in June rose in the most number of cities
tracked by the government in 11 months, China’s National Bureau
of Statistics said July 18. Prices climbed from the previous
month in 25 of the 70 cities that the government reviews, the
most since July last year.  “A disorderly decline in real estate investment could have
significant implications for growth in China and the global
economy,” the IMF said.  Property investment accounts for a quarter of total fixed
asset investment in China, which was $2.4 trillion in the first
half of 2012, according to the country’s  statistics bureau .  On the London Metal Exchange, nickel is down 15 percent
this year, lead has fallen 8.4 percent, tin 8.3 percent,
aluminum 6.8 percent, copper 1.9 percent and zinc 1.6 percent in
 London . The LMEX index, a measure of the performance of
industrial metals traded on the London bourse, is down 5.1
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
