Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  is investing
$300 million to finance  Sunrun Inc.  and SolarCity Corp. rooftop
solar systems in the U.S.  A $200 million investment for Sunrun will support
“thousands of residential solar systems,” the closely held San
Francisco-based company said today in a statement. The bank is
providing $100 million to SolarCity, matching an earlier
investment for commercial and home solar projects, the  San
Mateo , California-based company said in a separate statement.
Terms weren’t disclosed.  Sunrun and SolarCity typically own the systems, which are
often installed at no cost to homeowners and businesses that
purchase the electricity under long-term contracts. SolarCity
installs its own projects while Sunrun works with more than 25
contractors.  The financing arrangement is spurring wider use of rooftop
power projects, said Jerry Smith, managing director of the
Credit Suisse Strategic Transactions Group.  “The residential solar market is thriving right now, and
the model Sunrun created for affordable home solar is driving
that success,” Smith said in the statement.  Sunrun has installed systems on more than 24,000 U.S. homes
in 10 states and SolarCity has more than 28,000 customers in 14
states. SolarCity’s chairman, Elon Musk, is the chief executive
officer of  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)   To contact the reporters on this story:
