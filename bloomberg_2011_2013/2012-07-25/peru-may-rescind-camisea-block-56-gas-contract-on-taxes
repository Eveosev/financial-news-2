Peru  may rescind a contract with a
group led by Hunt Oil Co. for failing to pay sufficient
royalties on natural-gas shipments from the country’s largest
fields, a government official said.  The six-company group, which operates the  Camisea  project,
exported 10 shipments of gas from its Block 56 to third parties
without notifying Peru, said Aurelio Ochoa, president of state
oil-contracting agency Perupetro. The Camisea group, which
include Spain’s  Repsol SA (REP)  and Pluspetrol SA of  Argentina , has 60
days to pay the taxes or seek international arbitration, he
said.  “We’re sticking strictly to the contract,” Ochoa said at
a press conference today in Lima. “I hope we can solve this by
September to avoid rescinding the contract, as their only way
out is arbitration or payment.”  Peru’s President  Ollanta Humala  was elected last year on
pledges to force oil and mining companies to pay higher
royalties. Earlier this year, the government ordered the Camisea
group to halve its gas exports to Mexico to allocate gas
reserves to domestic industries.  Jeanne Phillips, a spokeswoman for Hunt Oil, was
unavailable for comment. Kristian Rix, a spokesman for Repsol,
and Daniel Guerra, a spokesman for Pluspetrol, didn’t respond to
e-mails and telephone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
