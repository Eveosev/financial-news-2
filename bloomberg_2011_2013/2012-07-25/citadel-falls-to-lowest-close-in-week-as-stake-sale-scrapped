Citadel Capital SAE (CCAP)  fell to the
lowest close in more than a week after the Egyptian private
equity firm called off the sale of its stake in National
Petroleum Co.  The shares of the Cairo-based company declined 1.7 percent
to 2.91 Egyptian pounds, the lowest close since July 16. That
brought the two-day loss to 4.9 percent. The benchmark EGX 30
Index retreated 1.5 percent.  The sale to  Sea Dragon Energy Inc. (SDX)  was called off without
penalty to either side, Citadel said in a filing to the Egyptian
bourse yesterday. The agreement was reached “in light of
uncertainty regarding the date on which the acquisition could be
completed as well as on-going economic turbulence locally and
internationally,” it said in a separate e-mailed statement.  “The stock’s negative reaction is a bit of a surprise,”
said Allen Sandeep, research analyst at Cairo-based  Beltone
Financial Holding (BTFH) , which has a hold recommendation on the
shares. “NPC is already an impaired asset so the failure to
sell it will not affect Citadel’s fair value.”  In January, Citadel said its unit Golden Crescent
Investments Ltd. had agreed to sell its stake in National
Petroleum to  Canada ’s Sea Dragon. Financing for the deal, which
was approved by the buyer’s shareholders, was already arranged,
Sea Dragon said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
