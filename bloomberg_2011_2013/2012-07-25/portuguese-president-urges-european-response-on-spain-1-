Europe needs to come up with an
appropriate response to the fiscal and banking crisis in  Spain ,
Portuguese President Anibal  Cavaco Silva  said.  “Besides the very courageous efforts of the Spanish
government, it is our understanding that there is a need for a
European response,” Cavaco Silva said in comments aired by SIC
Noticias television today. “What’s at stake here is the
stability of the entire euro zone.”  It’s important for the European Union and for Spain to
succeed in their efforts to weather the ongoing debt crisis, as
 Portugal ’s ability to meet its own targets, especially in terms
of economic growth, also depends on external factors, said
Cavaco Silva.  The European Commission approved a Spanish program to
bolster the capital of some of the country’s banks today after
officials denied a full-blown Spanish bailout was being
prepared. Portugal is cutting spending and raising taxes as it
tries to comply with the terms of its 78 billion-euro ($95
billion) rescue from the EU and the  International Monetary Fund .  “The Spanish problem is a problem that is of interest to
the entire European community and in particular to the euro
area,” said Cavaco Silva.  To contact the reporter on this story:
