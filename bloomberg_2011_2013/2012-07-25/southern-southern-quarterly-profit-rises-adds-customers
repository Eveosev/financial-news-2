Southern Co. (SO) , the second-largest
U.S. power company by market value, said second-quarter profit
rose as it benefited from economic recovery in the four
southeastern states it serves.  Net income rose to $623 million, or 71 cents a share, from
$604 million, or 71 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based
Southern said in a statement today. Excluding an insurance
settlement related to its former Mirant Corp. subsidiary, per-
share profit met the 69-cent average of 13  analysts’ estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Southern added 20,000 new residential customers in the
first half of 2012, more than it had expected to gain for the
year. “The future continues to look bright for our region,”
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Fanning said in the
statement.  Sales fell 7.5 percent to $4.18 billion from $4.52 billion
a year earlier, in what was “an unusually warm second quarter
in 2011,” the company said. Retail sales decreased 1.9 percent
and residential sales fell 4.3 percent, while commercial and
industrial dropped 1.4 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively.  Demand for power declined as consumers ran air conditioners
less than a year earlier, Mark Barnett, a Chicago-based equity
analyst with  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , said in a phone interview before
the results were announced.  Vogtle Update  Southern also faces potential cost overruns and delays as
it builds the first new U.S. nuclear reactors since the 1970s.
Southern and its partners have been negotiating who should pay
$400 million in costs resulting from a half-year delay in
licensing the two reactors at Vogtle, 26 miles (42 kilometers)
southeast of Augusta, Georgia.  “We expect a good bit of detail on Vogtle to be updated”
during Southern’s earnings call, Barnett said.  Southern has 4.4 million customers in  Alabama ,  Mississippi ,
Georgia and  Florida  and the capacity to produce 42,000 megawatts
of electricity, according to its website. That’s enough power
for about 33.6 million typical homes, according to a U.S. Energy
Department estimate.  The company’s results were announced before the start of
regular U.S. trading. Southern fell 1.1 percent to $47.11
yesterday in  New York . The shares have three buy, 15 hold and
four sell recommendations from analysts.  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  is the largest U.S. utility owner by
market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
