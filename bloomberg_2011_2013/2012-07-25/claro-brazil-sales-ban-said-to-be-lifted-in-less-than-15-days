America Movil SAB’s (AMXL)  Claro may be
allowed to resume sales of voice and data services in three
Brazilian states in less than 15 days, said a government
official familiar with the matter.  Brazil’s telecommunications regulator will take longer to
lift a similar ban on  Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) ’s sales in 19 of
Brazil’s 26 states including the Federal District, and  Oi SA’s (OIBR4) 
sales in five states, said the official, who asked not to be
identified because the companies are still negotiating
conditions with the government.  Network failures prompted the sales suspension, which
started on July 23. The ban on Claro includes Sao Paulo,
Brazil’s richest and most populous state, while Tim was blocked
from selling services in the second- and third-biggest states,
 Minas Gerais  and  Rio de Janeiro . Anatel, the telecommunications
regulator, announced the sanctions on June 18.  The end of the sales ban will hinge on the investment plans
presented by companies to improve the quality of service, said
Anatel in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  “Claro hopes it is authorized to resume the sales of its
services as soon as possible,” the company said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  Tim is in negotiations with the government to get its
investment plan approved, the company said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement.  Oi is scheduled to present to Anatel its investment plan
today, said a spokesman for the company who can’t be identified
because of internal policy.  -- Editor: Adriana Brasileiro  To contact the reporter on this story:
