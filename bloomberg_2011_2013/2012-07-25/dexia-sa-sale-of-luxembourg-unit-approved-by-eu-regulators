Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s sale of its Banque
Internationale a Luxembourg unit won European Union approval
after antitrust regulators said the deal didn’t create any
competition issues.  The sale of the Luxembourg unit of Dexia “didn’t lead to
any economic advantage financed through state aid, either for
Dexia BIL or for Dexia group,” the European Commission in
Brussels said in a statement today. “The sale doesn’t
constitute state aid.”  The decision concludes a probe into the Luxembourg unit’s
sale terms started in April. The commission said other probes
concerning Dexia state aid are ongoing.  Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden welcomed the EU’s
decision, according to an e-mailed statement by his government.  The commission’s approval is “the final procedural step”
before the implementation of the deal “that will finally allow
the BIL exit from Dexia,” according to the Luxembourg
government’s statement.  Under an agreement signed last year, Precision Capital of
Qatar will buy 90 percent of BIL and Luxembourg will own the
rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
