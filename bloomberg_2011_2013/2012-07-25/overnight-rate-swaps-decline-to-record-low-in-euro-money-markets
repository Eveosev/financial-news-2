An estimate of future average
overnight borrowing costs in euros fell to a record low,
according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month Eonia OIS swap fell as much as 1.1 basis
point to 7.8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and was 9
basis points at 8:45 a.m. in  London . The European Banking
Federation’s euro overnight indexed average, or Eonia, of
unsecured lending transactions, was set at a record low 11.3
basis points yesterday.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars declined.
The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks pay to
convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 44 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, from minus 46
yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was 52 basis points, or 0.52
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 53. Euribor is the
rate  banks  say they see each other lending in euros, according
to the same panel of banks that contribute to Eonia.  Banks reduced  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday to 324 billion euros ($392
billion) from 356 billion euros the day before.  Three-month Euribor fell to a record low 0.435 percent
yesterday from 0.442 the day before.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was 0.448 percent yesterday from 0.451 the
day before, the lowest since Nov. 8. Libor is published by the
British Bankers’ Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
