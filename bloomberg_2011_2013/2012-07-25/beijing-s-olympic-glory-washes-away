In 2008, the  Beijing Olympics  was a symbol of the Chinese government’s ability to organize a world-class event. For the most part, the Chinese people accepted the narrative. Now, in the days leading up to the  London  Olympics, that legacy is literally being drawn into the city’s sewers. It all began on July 21, when Beijing was  hammered  by 7 inches of rain -- with outlying areas receiving as much as 16 inches -- in what the local government claimed was the  heaviest  rainstorm since records were first kept in 1951. (The unprecedented nature has since been  challenged .) The huge volume of water quickly overwhelmed the city’s sewer system, causing  floods  that turned cars into boats, made stairwells into waterfalls and even set off landslides. The  widely-disputed  death toll now stands at 37. From the onset of the disaster, Beijing’s microbloggers were the most  reliable source  of information on the flooding, coordinating relief and showing up a government that lacked --  by its own admission  -- the ability to warn residents of impending danger. In the aftermath of the floods, those microbloggers have undertaken the task of assigning blame for the failure in Beijing’s sewer system. Government officials and unscrupulous contractors are universally regarded as culprits, but the tweeted critique points to a deeper cause: the indiscriminate pursuit of glitzy projects that give “face,” or prestige, to their builders. On Sunday morning, "fen1234," the handle of a microblogger in Anhui province, logged into Sina Weibo,  China ’s leading microblogging service, to  tweet : As of Tuesday evening, more than 1,850 Sina Weibo users had obliged fen1234 with a re-tweet. Similarly, on Monday night, Zou Song Jun, a graphic designer in Tianjin employed by state-owned  Tianjin TV ,  tweeted : For three decades, the Communist Party has  asserted its legitimacy  in large part on the basis of its ability to pull off big projects. Consequently, considerable propaganda resources were and are expended promoting the successful completion of mega-projects like the  Three Gorges Dam , the  Shanghai Expo  grounds, and the high-speed rail link between Shanghai and Beijing. When those projects succeed, the Party’s stature is enhanced. But when they  fail  -- as the high-speed rail system  did  spectacularly and  fatally  last summer when two trains collided outside the city of Wenzhou -- the Party comes under furious  attack . The 2008 Olympics were intended in large part as a demonstration of the Communist Party’s unrivaled competence. In China, more so than outside China, this was serious business: Any stumble threatened to tarnish that sought-after “ world-class ” image. Despite some  notable bumps  along the way, the Party managed the event well, and China (and the world) embraced the Olympics (and Beijing). The city's first-class image emerged from the Games intact, and mostly remained that way until China’s microbloggers realized, last weekend, that Beijing's sewer system was, at best,  second-class . Perhaps the harshest criticism of the floods came from the substantial number of microbloggers who recall China’s deployment of  rain dispersal technology  during the 2008 Olympics. Without such technology, some microbloggers point out, Beijing might have suffered floods while the whole world was watching. A particularly creative version of this meme was  tweeted  by a microblogging cat aficionado in  Fujian province : Predictably, government propaganda departments have been active in both  censoring  some of the highest-profile tweeted criticisms and promoting human interest stories, via microblogs and newspapers, that divert attention from government incompetence and its  consequences . Criticism on blogs has also been muted, with a few exceptions. The most notable is a long essay by  Leng Xue , a soccer reporter, which was posted to the  sports channel  of the Tencent web portal on Monday. Headlined “ If London Suffers from a Rainstorm, What Can Beijing Learn from It? ” it takes aim at a number of perceived government and social failings during the floods, including traffic tickets issued to stalled vehicles during the worst of the disaster. The final paragraph is as vicious as anything written and deleted from Sina Weibo in recent days: What, then, will be the result of this flood-induced re-assessment of Beijing 2008? Few in China doubt that the entire matter will soon recede into the public imagination, becoming just another scandal that once engendered public rage, not unlike the July 2011 high-speed rail crash. Life moves on, especially in an Olympic year. A Sina Weibo microblogger who writes under the handle "Keep Fighting," made just this point in a cynical, but no doubt true,  tweet  on Monday: And the medals, it turns out, will be bountiful. Xinhua, the state news agency,  predicts  that China will narrowly beat the U.S. for the most gold medals at the 2012 Olympics, replicating, at least on the podium, its 2008 glory.
