Natixis (KN) ’s asset-management unit and
investment manager AEW Europe plan to raise as much as 500
million euros ($608 million) for a fund to invest in European
real estate loans.  The Senior European Loan Fund will finance real estate
assets including office, retail and logistics properties mainly
in  France ,  Germany  and the U.K., according to a joint statement.  “The real estate financing market is experiencing a
structural change with a marked decrease in funding capacity of
the banking system, creating an opportunity for the emergence of
new participants in real estate debt,” AEW Europe Chief
Executive Officer Christian Delaire said in the e-mailed
statement.  The fund, which has already raised 240 million euros, seeks
to deliver returns similar to investment-grade bonds, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
