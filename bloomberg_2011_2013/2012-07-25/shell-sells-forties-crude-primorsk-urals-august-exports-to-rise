Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold  North Sea 
Forties crude at a one-month low. Rosneft Trading SA failed to
buy Russian Urals in northwest  Europe  at an unchanged price from
yesterday.  Russia plans to export 57 cargoes of Urals crude in August
from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk, three more than in July,
according to a preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg
News.  North Sea  Shell sold Forties cargo F0803 for Aug. 7 to Aug. 9 loading
to Gunvor Group Ltd. at 55 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
the lowest level since June 20, according to a Bloomberg survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window.
This compares with a discount of 25 cents for a trade yesterday.  Shipment F0803 was delayed by one day from the original
plan, said two people with knowledge of the shipping schedule,
declining to be identified because the information is
confidential. That is the first August cargo to be deferred.
Shell bought the lot on July 19 at a premium of 5 cents.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was at 28 cents a barrel less
than Dated Brent, the lowest since July 2, compared with parity
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for September settlement traded at $102.74 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $103.51 yesterday. The October contract was at
$101.93, a discount of 81 cents to September.  Mediterranean/Urals  Rosneft didn’t manage to buy 100,000 metric tons of Urals
for Aug. 10 to Aug. 14 loading at 45 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the survey
showed. This was unchanged from yesterday’s trade.  No bids or offers were made for the crude in the
Mediterranean for a fifth session. The  blend  was at 9 cents a
barrel more than Dated Brent in the region, compared with a
premium of 8 cents yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The shipping schedule of Urals from Primorsk comprises 56
cargoes of 100,000 tons each and one of 105,000 tons. That
totals 5.7 million tons, or 1.35 million barrels a day, compared
with 5.38 million tons for this month, the program showed.  Urals exports from Ust-Luga on the  Baltic Sea  will reach a
record 1.8 million tons next month, up from 1.5 million tons in
July, according to the plan. The terminal started operation in
late March.  Russia will ship 1.63 million tons of the benchmark blend
and 160,000 tons of Siberian Light grade from the Black Sea port
of Novorossiysk from July 31 to Aug. 15, the plan showed.  West Africa  Vitol Group failed to sell 950,000 barrels of Nigerian
Bonny Light crude for Aug. 15 to Aug. 20 delivered to Lavera,
France or Rotterdam at $2.35 a barrel more than Dated Brent, the
survey showed.  CPC Corp., a Taiwan state-run oil company, bought 4 million
barrels of Angolan crude for loading in September via a tender,
according to four traders who participate in the market.  The company bought 3 million barrels of Cabinda and 1
million barrels of the Nemba grade, according to the people, who
declined to be identified because the information is
confidential. CPC awarded the tender to Chevron Corp., Sonangol
Holdings and China International United Petroleum & Chemical
Co., or Unipec, they said.  Qua Iboe for loading from  Nigeria  fell 1 cent to $1.13 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
