Mitsubishi Electric & Electronics
USA Inc. won a reversal of a $124 million jury verdict awarded
to Grail Semiconductor Inc. in May in a breach-of-contract
lawsuit in California state court.  Grail claimed Mitsubishi Electric disclosed its
confidential information for a memory chip to an affiliated
company, Mitsubishi-Japan, and a jointly owned Japanese company,
Renesas.  Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Barnum in
 San Jose  erased the award yesterday, finding flaws in the jury’s
damages analysis, Raymond P. Niro, a lawyer representing Grail,
said in a statement. The judge upheld the jury’s finding of
liability, Barnum’s court clerk, Kevin Curdt, said today.  “We are really pleased that the trial judge agreed with
the jury on all the questions of liability,” Niro said in the
statement. “We now have a roadmap on how to improve our damages
case for the next trial.”  David Elkins, a lawyer representing Mitsubishi Electric, a
unit of Tokyo-based  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) , didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment today on the ruling.  The verdict, issued by a jury in San Jose, is the 13th-
largest jury award in the U.S. so far in 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The largest, for $956 million, was
against  Vivendi SA (VIV)  in a lawsuit over its 2001 purchase from
 Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA)  of its stake in USA Networks Inc.  The case is Grail Semiconductor Inc. v. Mitsubishi Electric
& Electronics USA Inc., 1-07-cv-098590, Santa Clara County
Superior Court (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
