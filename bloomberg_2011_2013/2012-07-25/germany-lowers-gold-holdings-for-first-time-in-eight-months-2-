Germany ’s gold holdings fell by 0.7
metric ton in June, the first decline in eight months, as the
Bundesbank sold metal to the  finance ministry  to mint
commemorative coins.  Turkey  and  Mexico  reduced bullion reserves.  Germany’s holdings dropped to 3,395.6 tons last month, data
on the International Monetary Fund’s website showed. The country
last cut reserves in October to mint coins, and sells a “small
amount” each year for that purpose, Bundesbank spokeswoman Ute
Bremers said. Turkey cut holdings by 0.8 ton, Mexico lowered
them by 0.1 ton and Guatemala added 0.2 ton in June, IMF data
show.  Central banks have been expanding reserves after the metal
climbed the past 11 years and holdings in  exchange-traded
products  are about 0.9 percent below the all-time high set on
July 5. The banks may buy more bullion this year than the 456
tons in 2011 as countries diversify their reserves, Ashish
Bhatia, the manager of government affairs at the World Gold
Council, said last month.  “If you look at our total  gold reserves  you see that this
is not a big deal,” Bundesbank spokesman Peter Trautmann said,
referring to the reduction in holdings. The central bank sells
about 6 to 7 tons each year to the finance ministry, he said.  Russia increased its gold holdings to 29.5 million ounces
last month, from 29.3 million ounces at the end of May, Bank
Rossii said in a statement on its website July 20. The June data
for the country hadn’t been updated on the IMF’s website.  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,589.05 an ounce by
10:39 a.m. in London and is up 1.6 percent this year. Prices
averaged $1,600.53 last month and reached a record $1,921.15 in
September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
