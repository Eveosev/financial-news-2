Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the electric-car
company led by  Elon Musk , said its second-quarter loss widened
after the end of battery-powered Roadster sales and ahead of
full output of the Model S sedan.  The company named for inventor  Nikola Tesla  had an adjusted
loss of 89 cents a share, narrower than an estimate of a deficit
of 94 cents, the average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, and wider than the loss of 53 cents a year earlier.
Revenue fell 54 percent to $26.7 million. Tesla’s net loss
totaled $105.6 million, or $1 a share, up from $58.9 million, or
60 cents, a year earlier.  The carmaker, which counts  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) 
as customers and investors, plans to accelerate Model S
deliveries in the year’s second half after starting production
of the car in June. The rechargeable sedan, with a base price of
$57,400 before a federal tax credit, is intended to generate the
company’s first profitable quarters as early as 2013. Tesla said
it has about 12,200 reservations for the Model S, up from 11,500
at the end of June.  “This accelerating pace of reservations makes us confident
that demand will surpass 20,000 Model S units for full-year 2013
deliveries,” Musk, co-founder and chief executive officer of
the  Palo Alto , California-based company, and Chief Financial
Officer Deepak Ahuja said in a statement on the company’s
 website .  Sedan Deliveries  The company reaffirmed that Model S deliveries should reach
5,000 in 2012 and that revenue for the year will be $560 million
to $600 million. Tesla said it expects to deliver 500 units of
the Model S during this quarter, with the rest in the fourth
quarter.  While Tesla may consider raising equity capital at some
point to provide a cushion and help fund vehicle development, it
won’t do so in the “very immediate future,” Musk said on a
conference call with analysts and investors.  Tesla fell 3 percent to $28.95 at the close in New York
yesterday before the company issued its results on its website.
The shares have gained 1.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
