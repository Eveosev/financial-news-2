T. Rowe Price Group Inc., the asset
manager that has posted a profit every quarter since going
public in 1986, said second-quarter profit rose 0.9 percent,
missing analysts’ estimates as slumping global stock markets
eroded assets.  Net income allocated to common stockholders increased to
$205.6 million, or 79 cents a share, from $203.8 million, or 76
cents, a year earlier, the Baltimore-based company said today in
a statement. T. Rowe Price missed the 80 cents per share
estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Declining global markets sent T. Rowe Price’s assets down
by 2.4 percent in the quarter to $541.7 billion. Investors added
$4.7 billion in deposits, down from a record $12.4 billion in
the first quarter. Investor sentiment soured in the quarter, as
economic conditions appeared to weaken in the U.S.,  China  and
 Europe , James Kennedy, T. Rowe Price’s chief executive officer,
said today in a telephone interview.  “In the last couple of months, the economic momentum we
saw earlier in the year seems to be in question and flows slowed
down a wee bit,” Kennedy said.  T. Rowe Price fell 2.8 percent to close at $58.97 in  New
York  trading. The shares gained 3.6 percent this year compared
with a 2.9 percent increase in the 20-member  Standard & Poor’s 
index of custody banks and asset managers.  T. Rowe Price’s assets under management declined by $17.8
billion because of market losses, as the MSCI ACWI index of
global stocks declined 6.6 percent in the second quarter.  Client Deposits  T. Rowe Price has benefited as  investment performance  at
funds beat rivals and retirement-oriented offerings drew
investors. The firm has gathered deposits even as investors
withdrew $42.6 billion from funds that buy U.S. stocks in the
first six months of 2012, data from Chicago-based  Morningstar
Inc. (MORN)  show.  BlackRock Inc., (BLK)  the world’s largest asset manager, had net
client redemptions of $29.4 billion in the second quarter,
including $31.6 billion in planned dispositions of advisory
portfolios, the company reported.  At the end of June, 73 percent of T. Rowe Price’s mutual
funds beat the average return posted by competitors over three
years and 85 percent outperformed for five years, the company
said, citing data compiled by Denver-based research firm Lipper.  Retirement Funds  T. Rowe Price had $71 billion in its target-date retirement
funds as of June 30, third-most in the industry behind Boston-
based  Fidelity Investments  and  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania-based
Vanguard Group Inc., according to Morningstar. Retirement funds
attracted $2.8 billion in the second quarter, the company said.  The firm’s revenues rose 3.2 percent from the second
quarter a year earlier to $736.8 million, trailing the $753.8
million estimate by 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Operating
expenses climbed 5.6 percent from a year earlier to $408.8
million.  In the five years ended June 30, T. Rowe Price’s shares
rose at an average annual pace of 6.1 percent compared with an
annual loss of 6.7 percent for the Standard & Poor’s index of
custody banks and asset managers, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
