The New York Yankees defeated the
Seattle Mariners 5-2 after  Alex Rodriguez  was placed on the 15-
day disabled list with a broken left hand.  Jayson Nix hit a three-run double in the eighth inning to
give the Yankees a 4-2 lead as  Derek Jeter ,  Robinson Cano  and
Mark Teixeira crossed home plate. Nix scored on Russell Martin’s
single for the final run.  “I wasn’t trying to do too much, I just wanted to get one
run in,” Nix told reporters. “I think that helped because I
wasn’t trying to do too much on the ball.”  Jeter hit his eighth home run of the Major League Baseball
season in the first inning at Safeco Field in Seattle yesterday
to give the Yankees a 1-0 lead.  Kyle Seager tied it on a bases-loaded walk and Mike Carp
made it 2-1 with a run-scoring groundout in the bottom of the
first.  Eric Chavez , who took Rodriguez’s place at third base,
walked twice and went 0-for-2.  Rodriguez, who turns 37 tomorrow, may be out as long as
eight weeks after being hit by  Felix Hernandez ’s fastball during
the eighth inning of New York’s 4-2 loss to the Mariners two
nights ago.  Rodriguez’s 644 career home runs are fifth in major league
history. He is batting .276 with 15 homers and 44 runs batted in
this season.  The Yankees yesterday recalled infielder Ramiro Pena from
Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, the team said in a Twitter post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
