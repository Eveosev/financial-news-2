Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s biggest producing region, rose 2 percent in
the first half of this month, industry group Unica said.  Output between July 1 and July 15 rose to 2.64 million
metric tons from 2.59 million tons a year earlier, Sao Paulo-
based Unica said in an e-mailed statement today. The current
crop year started April 1.  Cane growers in the region, which produces about 90 percent
of Brazil’s sugar and ethanol, harvested 42.2 million tons of
cane in the period, up from 40.6 million tons a year earlier.  Mills turned about 50.2 percent of the cane into sugar in
the first half of this month, up from 49.2 percent a year
earlier. The rest was processed into fuel. Ethanol output fell
2.5 percent to 1.61 billion liters (425 million gallons).  Cane output in the region is expected to rise to between
500 million and 505 million tons in the current crop, from 490
million in the past season, Unica Chairman Pedro Parente said
June 14.  Sugar production will increase 5.8 percent to 33.1 million
tons, Unica said in an April 12 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
