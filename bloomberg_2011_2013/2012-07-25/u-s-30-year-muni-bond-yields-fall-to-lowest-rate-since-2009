Benchmark 30-year municipal-bond
yields fell to their lowest level since at least the start of
2009 as investors sought a haven in tax-exempt debt amid concern
that  Europe ’s debt crisis will persist.  Yields on top-rated tax-exempts due in 2042 sank to 3.015
percent at 10 a.m. in  New York , the lowest level since a
Bloomberg Valuation index began in January 2009.  Interest rates on federal debt due in 30 years fell to an
all-time low of  2.445 percent  today amid concern Europe’s debt
crisis is spreading to other nations in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
