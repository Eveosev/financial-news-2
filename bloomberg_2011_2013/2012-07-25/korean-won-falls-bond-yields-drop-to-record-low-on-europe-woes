South Korea’s won weakened and
 government bonds  rose, sending yields to all-time lows, on
concern Europe’s debt crisis will slow global economic growth.  The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of shares dropped 1.6 percent after
estimates by Markit Economics showed yesterday that euro-area
services and manufacturing output contracted for a sixth month
in July. South Korean  consumer confidence  dropped to a five-
month low in July, central bank figures showed today. The
 Finance Ministry  said in a report to parliament yesterday that
conditions are deteriorating in the global economy.  “Europe’s weak manufacturing data and stocks declining are
putting downward pressure on the won,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a
Seoul-based currency analyst for Samsung Futures Inc. “Steep
declines in the won may be limited as investors short the euro
and buy the won.” A short position is a bet that a currency
will decline.  The won fell 0.6 percent to 1,153.15 per dollar as of 9:15
a.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,153.24 earlier, the weakest since July 13. The
currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, advanced 14 basis points, or
0.14 percentage point, to 8 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2015 fell five
basis points to 2.78 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
Three-year debt futures rose 0.16 to 106.27 and the one-year
interest-rate swap declined three basis points to 2.76 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
