New York  gasoline weakened after a
government report showed regional imports of the fuel rose to
the highest level in six months.  Gasoline imports  for PADD 1 increased 368,000 barrels a day
to 964,000 barrels last week, the highest level since Jan. 27,
according to the Energy Department.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor fell 1.12 cents to 4.88 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:28 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
7.21 cents to $2.8127 a gallon.  Gasoline stocks on the East Coast gained 1.9 million
barrels to 54.1 million, the highest level in four weeks,
according to government data.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  held at a discount of 0.13
cent versus futures.  Motiva Enterprises LLC has restarted the fluid catalytic
cracker at its 255,000-barrel-a-day Convent, Louisiana,
refinery, according to a person familiar with the unit’s
operation.  The unit is running after being repaired, said the person,
who declined to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
speak for the refinery.  Flint Hills Resources LLC’s Corpus Christi,  Texas , refinery
had a release on the flare line in its alkylation unit late
yesterday, according to Katie Stavinoha, a Houston-based
spokeswoman for the company. Plant workers isolated the release
and the unit is stable, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
