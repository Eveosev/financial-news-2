National Iranian Oil Co. will
introduce a new generation of buy-back contracts “soon” for
its oil and gas fields to attract domestic and foreign
investors,  Shargh  reported, without citing anyone.  The terms would allow partners to cooperate beyond

elaborating.  Under buy-back contracts, companies fund exploration and
recover their investment at a pre-arranged rate of return from
subsequent production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
