Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA) ,  Nigeria ’s second-
biggest lender by market value, said second-quarter profit
jumped 32 percent from a year earlier.  Net income rose to 42.4 billion naira ($265 million) from
32.1 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based lender said
today in a statement on the website of the Nigerian Stock
Exchange. Revenue advanced 23 percent to 151.1 billion naira.  The net income “defied our conservative expectation, as it
came in 6 percent stronger than our estimate of 39 billion
naira,” Vetiva Capital Management said today in an e-mailed
note by Lagos-based analyst Abiola Rasaq. Revenue was higher
than the expected 140 billion naira, he said.  Zenith  shares  retreated 0.1 percent to 14.68 naira at the
close in Lagos, reducing their advance this year to 24 percent,
compared with an 11.6 percent rise in the  Nigerian Stock
