Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT4) ,  Brazil ’s
largest phone company by revenue, dropped to an 11-month low
after profit fell as customers canceled fixed-line service.  Shares retreated 1.5 percent to 45.50 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the lowest price since Aug. 12. It was the worst
performer on the  MSCI Brazil/Telecommunication Services Index (MXBR0TC) ,
which lost 0.8 percent.  Second-quarter earnings fell 5.6 percent to 1.09 billion
reais ($536 million) as income from fixed-line service declined
12 percent. Sales rose 0.2 percent to 8.24 billion reais,
trailing the 8.49 billion reais average estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Net income really disappointed, especially in the fixed-
line business,” Felipe Rocha, an analyst at Omar Camargo
Corretora, said by phone from Curitiba, Brazil. “Everybody now
tends to use mobile phones more than fixed, and this is
impacting Vivo’s results.”  Vivo is the brand under which Telefonica is reorganizing
all its mobile, fixed telephone, cable TV and Internet services.  The stock has fallen 12 percent this year, while the
benchmark Bovespa equity index slipped 7.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
