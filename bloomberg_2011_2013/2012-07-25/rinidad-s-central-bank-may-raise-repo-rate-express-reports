Trinidad and Tobago’s central bank
may raise the Caribbean island’s benchmark repo rate to control
inflation, the Trinidad Express  reported , citing comments by
bank president Jwala Rambarran.  The bank will announce a possible rate adjustment next week
in the context of rising consumer prices, the Port of Spain-
based newspaper cited Rambarran as saying.  Annual inflation accelerated to 12.6 percent in May from
11.8 percent in April, according to the latest report from the
central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
