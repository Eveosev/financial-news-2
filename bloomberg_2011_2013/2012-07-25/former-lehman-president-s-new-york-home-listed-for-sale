A mansion on  New York ’s  Long Island 
owned by Joseph M. Gregory, the former president and chief
operating officer of bankrupt investment bank Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., is up for sale for $22 million.  The 10-acre (4-hectare) Lloyd Harbor property has a 15,000-
square-foot (1,400-square-meter) main residence and a 6,000-
square-foot guest house, according to  Zillow Inc. ’s website. The
estate has six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, according to the
real estate information company.  The property was listed under Gregory’s name in court
 documents  related to Lehman’s bankruptcy filing. Photographs on
Zillow’s  website  of the home, custom built in 2002, show a
staircase-accessible closet with built-in shoe shelves, a
hardwood dock and a swimming pool with a view of Long Island
Sound.  The listing was reported yesterday by  Business Insider .  Gregory joined Lehman in 1974. He became co-COO in 2002,
and was named president and sole COO in 2004.  Lehman Brothers ’s
2008 bankruptcy filing was the largest in U.S. history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
