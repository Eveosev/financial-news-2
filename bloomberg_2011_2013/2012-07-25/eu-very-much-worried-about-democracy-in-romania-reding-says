The European Union remains concerned
about democratic backsliding in Romania, which will hold a
presidential impeachment vote in four days, the bloc’s Justice
Commissioner  Viviane Reding  said.  “I’m still very much worried about the state of democracy
in Romania,” Reding told reporters in Brussels today. “We will
look at the facts, not at the promises. We will look at the laws
and the implementation of the laws.”  A political struggle between Romania’s ruling coalition led
by Prime Minister Victor Ponta and suspended President Traian Basescu prompted EU leaders, including European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , to
voice concerns about adhering to the 27-nation’s democratic
principles.  The one-month suspension of Basescu before the impeachment
vote through various legal changes and Parliamentary proceedings
prompted the commission to ask Ponta to revoke emergency decrees
his government pushed through the legislature.  The commission issued a justice report on  Romania  on July
18 said that it will continue to monitor developments in the
country and that another report will be released by the end of
2012. Barroso said at the time that Ponta agreed to implement
all measures sought by the EU.  “The situation will be under very narrow observation,”
Reding said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
