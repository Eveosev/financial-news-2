Israel ’s five-year consumer price-
linked bonds rose, pushing yields to the lowest level since they
were issued in March, on bets inflation may accelerate as the
government plans to raise taxes to fund a widening deficit.  The yield on the 1 percent bonds due May 2017 fell nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 0.404 percent at
12:28 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The two-year break-even rate, the yield
difference between inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate
government bonds of similar maturity, rose 4 basis points to
222, implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.22 percent.  Israel’s Cabinet will consider next week a proposal to
increase value-added tax by 1 percentage point and cut this
year’s budget by as much as 900 million shekels ($220 million),
a Finance Ministry official said today. Prime Minister  Benjamin
Netanyahu ’s Cabinet will also look to raise taxes on cigarettes
and alcoholic beverages, the official said.  “Prices are set to rise as the government is likely to
increase the value-added tax,” said Ori Greenfeld, head of the
macroeconomic research department at Psagot Investment House
Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “This environment gives support for
inflation-linked bonds.”  Deficit Target  A government committee yesterday approved increasing the
2013 deficit target to 3 percent of gross domestic product, from
the originally planned 1.5 percent.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 percent bonds due January
2022 decrease three basis points to 4.05 percent. The
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on May 22
warned Israel against a “substantial” overshooting of deficit
targets and recommended raising value-added tax to help pay for
“positive structural reforms.”  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, fell two basis points,
to 2 percent. The  Bank of Israel  this week kept its benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged at 2.25 percent and warned  that the
government has yet to show how it will meet its deficit target.  The shekel strengthened for the first time since July 19,
adding 0.2 percent to 4.0620 a dollar. The  Tel-Bond 40 index  of
corporate bonds rose 0.1 percent to 264.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
