Zambia,  Africa ’s biggest copper
producer, plans to own as much as 25 percent of new mines in the
country as it seeks to attract investors to boost employment,
Mines Minister Christopher Yaluma said.  “We don’t have any intentions to raise our ownership in
most of the mining houses,” he said by phone today from Lusaka,
the capital. The state owns 10 percent to 20 percent in most
Zambian mines, and has a 35 percent stake in Maamba Collieries,
the southern African nation’s largest coal mine.  Companies including  Canada ’s  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) ,
London-based  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  and  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the
biggest producer of the metal, own mines in the country.  The government plans to announce a deal where it gets 20
percent to 25 percent ownership of an exploration project next
week, Yaluma said, declining to identify the company, as talks
were continuing. Zambia holds stakes in mines through ZCCM
Investment Holdings Plc.  The government wants to create an “enabling environment”
for mining investment to create jobs in a country with a 14
percent official unemployment rate, he said. “Our stance with
investors is we value them. We need them in our country,” said
Yaluma, who replaced Wylbur Simuusa as mines minister March 7.  Zambia is no longer seeking 35 percent ownership of local
mines, as Simuusa said it would Oct. 20, according to Yaluma.
The country, which doubled royalties for copper producers to 6
percent Nov. 11, will leave the tax regime unchanged “for a
while,” said Yaluma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
