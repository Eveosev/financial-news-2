The market for activated carbon,
used as a specialty chemical for water treatment and air
purification in the automotive, food, beverage and
pharmaceutical industries, may grow at least 13 percent a year
to $3 billion by 2017, Global Information Inc. reported.  Rising demand for activated carbon will be led by  Asia  and
 North America , which combined for almost three-quarters of
global sales last year, GII said yesterday in a report. The U.S.
is the largest global market for activated carbon, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
