Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos won support from his French counterpart,  Pierre Moscovici , to push for fast implementation of Europe’s June 29
agreement to use bailout funds to stabilize debt markets.  Spain and France pledge to implement the decisions “fully
and rapidly,” according to a joint statement by the ministers
who met in Paris today.  Germany  has backed away from offering the possibility that
Europe’s bailout fund may lend directly to Spanish banks,
relieving the struggling sovereign from added debt. German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , who met De Guindos
yesterday in Berlin, told his lawmakers the Spanish government
will be on the hook for rescue loans to the country’s banks.  Moscovici and De Guindos also repeated the assertion the
Spanish official made in a joint statement with Schaeuble
yesterday that the yields investors are demanding to lend to the
Spanish government don’t reflect the economy’s fundamentals.
 Europe ’s bailout of Spanish banks will boost confidence in the
country’s financial system and strengthen the entire euro area,
Moscovici and De Guindos added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
