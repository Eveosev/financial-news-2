Shooting guard Mookie Jones said his
basketball career at  Syracuse University  is over, midway through
serving a yearlong school suspension after being accused of
cyberbullying, Syracuse.com reported.  “I’m done playing at Syracuse,” Jones  told the website  at
a summer league game last night in Utica, New York.  Jones played 2 1/2 seasons for the Orange before leaving
the team in January for “personal reasons,” Syracuse.com said.  The school suspended him for a year after a female student
accused Jones of cyberbullying last fall, claiming Jones filled
his Facebook page with unflattering characterizations of her,
Syracuse.com said. The suspension, which ends in January,
probably would create eligibility issues for Jones, the website
said.  Jones isn’t enrolled at the university, Erin Kane, a
spokeswoman for the Syracuse,  New York , school, said in an e-
mail. Federal privacy laws and university policy precluded her
from discussing Jones’s case, Kane said.  Jones averaged 2.9 points in seven games for the Orange
last season before leaving the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
