French jobless claims rose to the
highest in almost 13 years in June as stalling growth prompted
companies to trim payrolls.  The number of people actively looking for work rose by
23,700, or 0.8 percent, to 2,945,800, the Labor Ministry said
today in an e-mailed statement from Paris. That’s the highest
since August 1999. Three economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
expected claims of between 2.937 million and 2.957 million.  Faced with a sovereign debt crisis in its third year,
governments across  Europe  are trying to reduce budget deficits,
lowering demand for French goods and services at home and
abroad. Companies ranging from carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen to
airline Air France-KLM Group have reduced staff.  “Faced with this situation, the government is entirely
mobilized to respond to this social urgency,” the Labor
Ministry said in a statement today.  The French government today announced a plan to boost the
car market that includes 490 million ($560 million) of
incentives to buy low-emission cars, as well as support for
research into new technologies. Peugeot plans to cut 8,000 jobs
and close a factory on the outskirts of Paris. Employment by
French car builders has fallen 30 percent in the past 10 years.  France ’s economy didn’t expand in the first quarter and the
Bank of France estimates that it may shrink in the second
quarter. The nation’s unemployment rate stood at 10 percent at
the end of the first quarter,also its highest since 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
