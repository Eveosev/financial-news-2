Switzerland so far has frozen almost
$700 million belonging to former Egyptian President  Hosni
Mubarak  and his family after discovering additional funds,  20
Minuten Online  reported, citing Jeannette Balmer, spokeswoman
for the Federal Attorney General’s office.  The amount exceeds a previously reported estimate of 410
million Swiss francs ($415 million), the newspaper said. The
funds are being investigated by the Attorney General because of
suspected  money laundering  and links to criminal activities, the
newspaper reported.  Switzerland’s federal court in April accepted Egypt as a
plaintiff in the case and is awaiting a formal request by Egypt
for a return of the funds, 20 Minuten said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
