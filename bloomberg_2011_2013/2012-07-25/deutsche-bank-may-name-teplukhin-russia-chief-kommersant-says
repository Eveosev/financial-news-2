Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  may hire Pavel Teplukhin, a former head of asset management at Troika Dialog,
to head its Russian operations, Kommersant  reported , citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Teplukhin is competing for the position with a former
colleague at Troika, Jacques Megreditchian, the Moscow-based
newspaper said today.  Deutsche Bankâ€™s current country chief, Igor Lojevsky, is
stepping down later this year, Kommersant said. The bank's 
press service in Moscow declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
