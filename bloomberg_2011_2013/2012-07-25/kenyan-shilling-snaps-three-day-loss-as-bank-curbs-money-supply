Kenya’s shilling snapped a three-day
losing streak as the central bank removed money from the market
through  repurchase agreements .  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 1.2 percent to 83.30 a dollar, the biggest gain since
June 7, and was trading 0.3 percent stronger at 84.10 by 4:50
p.m. in Nairobi the capital.  “The Kenyan shilling is being supported by the central
bank liquidity mop ups,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in a
note to clients today. “We expect the shilling to trade within
the range of 84.00 and 84.50.”  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 1 billion shillings
($11.9 million) in seven-day repurchase agreements at a yield of
12.75 percent, according to a bank official, who asked not to be
identified in line with policy.  Uganda ’s shilling weakened less than 0.1 percent to
2,478.75 per dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling gained for a
second day, rising 0.2 percent to 1,579 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
