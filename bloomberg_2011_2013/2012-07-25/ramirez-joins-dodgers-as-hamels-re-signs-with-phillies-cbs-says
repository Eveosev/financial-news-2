All-Star pitcher  Cole Hamels  is
staying with the Philadelphia Phillies under a $144 million,
six-year contract extension, while Hanley Ramirez joined the Los
Angeles Dodgers as the centerpiece of a four-player trade with
the Miami Marlins.  Hamels’s extension runs through 2018, the Phillies said in
a statement, and is the second-most lucrative for a pitcher in
Major League Baseball history, behind CC Sabathia’s $161
million, seven-year deal with the  New York Yankees .  Ramirez, a three-time All-Star and former batting champion
who moved to third base from shortstop this season, joins a
Dodgers’ team that’s has a 53-45 record while scoring the sixth-
fewest runs in baseball.  Matt Kemp  and  Andre Ethier  are the only
Dodgers with more than seven home runs. Ramirez has 14.  “The addition of a hitter the caliber of Hanley Ramirez
improves our lineup from top to bottom, inserting a proven run
producer to go along with Matt and Andre,” Dodgers General
Manager Ned Colletti said in a statement. “We’re excited for
Hanley to begin a new chapter in Los Angeles.”  Hamels, a 28-year-old left-hander, has spent his entire
seven-year career in Philadelphia and compiled an 85-58 record
with a 3.38 earned run average. The Most Valuable Player of the
Phillies’  World Series  win in 2008, Hamels is 11-4 this season
with a 3.23 ERA in 19 starts.  Big Contracts  The Phillies are 43-54 after making the playoffs the past
five seasons and reaching two World Series. They have committed
$356.5 million to pitchers  Cliff Lee ,  Roy Halladay  and Hamels
and first baseman  Ryan Howard  through the 2018 season. Hamels
will have the same annual salary as Lee, who has a five-year,
$120 million contract with the Phillies.  Ramirez, 28, joins the Dodgers along with left-handed
relief pitcher Randy Choate for starting pitcher Nathan Eovaldi
and minor-league pitcher Scott McGough.  Ramirez, the 2009 NL batting champion and 2006 NL rookie of
the year, is hitting .246 with 47 runs batted in this season. A
career .300 hitter, Ramirez batted a career-low .243 last
season, when he missed two months with a shoulder injury that
required surgery.  Ramirez has three years left on a six-year deal that is set
to pay him $15 million this season, $15 million in 2013 and $16
million in 2014. He may take over at shortstop in  Los Angeles 
until Dee Gordon returns from the disabled list in a month and
then move to third base.  Pirates Trade  The Pittsburgh Pirates acquired pitcher Wandy Rodriguez
from the Houston Astros today for three minor-league prospects
as they seek a postseason berth for the first time since 1992.  Rodriguez, a 33-year-old left-hander, has a 7-9 record with
a 3.79 earned run average in 21 starts this season. The Astros
have the worst record in the majors, 34-64.  The Pirates are in second place in the NL Central Division
with a 54-42 record, 2 1/2 games behind the Cincinnati Reds.
Pittsburgh has had 20 straight losing seasons since making the
NL Championship Series from 1990 through 1992.  The MLB trade deadline is July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
