China warned that new rainstorms are
forecast for several provinces after the heaviest flooding in 31
years hit Chongqing along the  Yangtze River , the Xinhua News
Agency reported.  The coming three days will see “medium to heavy rains or
rainstorms” in Guangdong, Hainan, Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan,
the China Meteorological Administration said on its website.
Beijing, which suffered the heaviest rainstorm in 60 years last
weekend, may see intense rainfall later today, it said.  Water flow into the reservoir above the Three Gorges Dam on
the Yangtze reached 71,200 cubic meters per second at 8 p.m.
Tuesday, the most since the dam started operation in 2003,
according to Xinhua. Rainstorms since the weekend killed at
least 37 people in Beijing and 58 elsewhere, Xinhua said.  Nearly 30,000 people were called to stand guard to protect
the dikes in Jingzhou, a central Chinese city with more than 6
million people, according to Xinhua.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
