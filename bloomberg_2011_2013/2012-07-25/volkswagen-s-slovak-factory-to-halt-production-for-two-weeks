The Slovak unit of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) 
will halt production for two weeks starting July 30, spokesman
Vladimir Machalik said.  The unit will use the companywide vacation period for
maintenance of production lines, he said in an e-mailed
statement from Bratislava, Slovakia today. Construction of new
facilities will continue during the break, he said.  Europe ’s biggest carmaker plans to boost output in its
Bratislava factory to a record 400,000 vehicles this year,
driven by the so-called New Small Family subcompact models.
Volkswagen also makes Touareg and Audi Q7 sport-utility vehicles
in Slovakia, as well as Porsche Cayenne bodies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
