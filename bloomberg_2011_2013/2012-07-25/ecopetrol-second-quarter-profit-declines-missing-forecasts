Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , the world’s best-
performing major oil producer, said second-quarter profit fell
as costs rose, missing analysts’ forecasts.  Net income slid 2.5 percent to 3.66 trillion pesos ($2.03
billion), from 3.75 trillion pesos a year earlier, the Bogota-
based company said yesterday after markets closed. Profit
trailed the 4.17 trillion-peso average estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Guerrillas have stepped up attacks on pipelines and oil
fields, increasing transport costs and hampering production at
state-run Ecopetrol. Rebels are targeting infrastructure as an
armed conflict stretches into its fifth decade in  Colombia ,
South America’s third-largest crude supplier.  “Most oil activity is in rural areas where armed groups
have a presence,” said Mauricio Hernandez, an analyst at
Corredores Asociados SA in Bogota, which has a hold
recommendation on Ecopetrol. “So it puts production targets at
risk.” Hernandez doesn’t own the company’s shares.  Production at Ecopetrol, Colombia’s largest oil company,
rose 4.8 percent to 762,200 barrels a day in the second quarter
from 727,200 barrels a year earlier. It climbed from 743,400
barrels a day in the first quarter.  Guerrillas this week blasted part of Ecopetrol’s Cano
Limon-Covenas pipeline, causing an  oil spill  in eastern
Colombia. Carrying oil by truck is more costly, according to
Hernandez.  Share Gains  Ecopetrol rose 0.9 percent in Bogota trading yesterday to
close at 4,995 pesos. Shares have returned 35 percent in U.S.
dollar terms in 2012, the best-performing major oil producer
with a market value of more than $50 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company has surpassed  Total SA, (FP) 
Statoil ASA and Gazprom OAO to become the world’s seventh-
largest with a market value of $114 billion.  Ecopetrol is investing in decades-old fields in Colombia
and exploring in the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico ,  Brazil  and  Peru  as
part of an $80 billion expansion plan to increase output to 1
million barrels a day in 2015 and 1.3 million barrels in 2020.  This year, Ecopetrol plans to reach a record 800,000
barrels a day from an average of 724,100 barrels a day in 2011.
The government is taking steps to increase security to defend
energy infrastructure from sabotage, Mines and Energy Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  said this week.  “The rebels want to send a message to discourage
investment,” said Cesar Cuervo, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Correval SA, which has a hold recommendation on the
stock.  The Colombian government owns 88.5 percent of Ecopetrol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
