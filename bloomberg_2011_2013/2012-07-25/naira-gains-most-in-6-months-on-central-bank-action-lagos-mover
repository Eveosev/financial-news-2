Nigeria ’s naira rose to its
strongest in almost two months against the dollar after the
central bank cut the proportion of lenders’ assets that can be
held as foreign exchange and held the  benchmark interest rate  at
a record high.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer strengthened
0.7 to 159.75 per dollar as of 3:18 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its strongest on a closing basis since May
29.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  said yesterday it reduced the
amount of foreign exchange banks can hold as a percentage of
their shareholders’ funds to 1 percent from 3 percent and kept
its  interest rate  unchanged at 12 percent. The amount of cash as
a percentage of deposits that commercial banks must hold with
the central bank was increased to 12 percent from 8 percent,
Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  “We expect transient relief in the interbank  currency
market  as some banks adjust their net asset exposure to comply
with the new regulation, which will likely lead to a retraction
in foreign-exchange demand and a resultant firming of the
currency,” Adedayo Idowu, a Lagos-based analyst at Vetiva
Capital Management Ltd., said in e-mailed comments today.  Nigeria sold $217 million at a foreign-currency auction
today at 155.84 naira per dollar, compared with 155.89 at the
previous sale on July 23, the Abuja-based central bank said in
an e-mailed statement.  Inflation accelerated to 12.9 percent in June, from 12.7
percent in May, the Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics
said July 18. The country’s foreign-currency reserves have
fallen by $1.3 billion since the end of May to $36.391 billion,
according to July 23 data compiled by the central bank.  Reserves  The impact of the bank’s decisions will be a stabilization
of the  exchange rate  at 160 to 163 per dollar, and an increase
in bond yields, “particularly at the long end, and a gradual
accretion of reserves,” CSL Stockbroker Ltd. analysts,
including London-based  Alan Cameron , wrote in a research report.  The yield on Nigeria’s seven-year domestic bonds due June
2019 fell two basis points to 16.03 percent, according to July
24 data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 were
unchanged at 5.477 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated for the fifth day, weakening 0.1
percent to 1.9575 per dollar in Accra, the capital, the lowest
since at least 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
