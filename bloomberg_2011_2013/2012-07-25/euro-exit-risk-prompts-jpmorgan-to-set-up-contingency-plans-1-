JPMorgan Chase & Co. has set up a
contingency plan allowing it to resume trading the bonds of any
nation exiting the euro area to avoid disruption to its clients.  The largest  U.S. bank  by assets said while a break-up of
the 17-nation  currency zone  was not its central view, the
possibility has convinced it to establish procedures to limit
any disruption to its bond-trading activities. The implied
probability of a country leaving the monetary union is 59
percent for next year, and 66 percent by the end of 2014, based
on bets at  Intrade.com .  Spain  hasn’t ruled out quitting the
euro, El Confidencial reported this week.  “We’ve been doing some contingency work to ensure that we
have a robust system and ability to absorb shocks if on a Sunday
night a sovereign decides to leave the euro,” Carl Norrey, head
of European rates securities at JPMorgan in  London , said in
interview on July 23. “The probability of a country exiting the
euro is no longer zero.”  Financial turmoil in the euro area deepened this week as
the Spanish region of Valencia said it will need aid from the
central government, and Moody’s Investors Service put a negative
outlook on the Aaa ratings of  Germany , the Netherlands and
Luxembourg, saying they may need to spend more bailing out other
member nations.  Spanish and Italian bonds slumped this week, adding to
speculation the nations will need financial assistance. Spain’s
 10-year yields  surged to a euro-era record of 7.751 percent
today, while the rate on its two-year notes breached 7 percent
for the first time.  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  sought external
help after their borrowing costs rose above that level. Italian
10-year yields climbed to 6.71 percent, the most since Jan. 16.  Exit Forecasts  A survey published by JPMorgan on July 17 showed that 29
percent of the 145 clients who responded believed that Greece
would leave the euro this year, and as much as 5 percent
predicted a core country would exit the single currency in 2013.  German Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler told broadcaster ARD
on July 22 he was “very skeptical” Greece could be rescued.
The Spanish government hasn’t ruled out leaving the euro as it
considers options including an international bailout, the El
Confidencial newspaper reported, citing people close to Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy .  “If one of the euro countries leave, we would be able to
segregate all the securities, have them in different books,
format new international securities identification numbers, and
be ready to trade with clients in as short a period of time as
possible,” Norrey said. “It’s a massive task. You don’t want
to be starting that process from scratch on Monday morning.”  Primary Dealer  JPMorgan has no plans to withdraw from any nation in the
euro area where it is a market maker even as the debt crisis
makes it become more “expensive” to be a primary dealer,
Norrey said. JPMorgan trades directly with every sovereign
issuer in the euro area.  “No one can say it’s easy to be a primary dealer at the
moment,” he said. “Auctions have become expensive in an
environment of low flow but high volatility. But as a major bank
and a provider of liquidity, we need to be there to assist our
clients.”  Primary dealers are firms obliged to bid at government bond
sales to ensure there is enough demand to keep borrowing costs
low. They have to purchase a certain amount of the debt issued
each year and take the risk they may be unable to sell the
securities afterward.  In return, primary dealers benefit because, in most cases,
investors buy the securities on offer. Central banks and some
pension funds will only do business with such financial
institutions.  “Being a primary dealer gives you unparalleled insight into
the challenges that clients face at the point of issuance right
through to deal performance in secondary-market trading,”
Norrey said. “It gives you a stronger case to be at the table
again and again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
