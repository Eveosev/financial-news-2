Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) , the largest
U.S. natural-goods grocer, reported third-quarter profit that
rose more than analysts estimated and boosted its annual
earnings forecast as sales gained at established stores.  Net income increased 32 percent to $116.8 million, or 63
cents a share, from $88.5 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier,
the Austin, Texas-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts  estimated  61 cents, according to the average of 26
projections compiled by Bloomberg.  Whole Foods, which is accelerating store openings in the
U.S. Midwest to help boost revenue, said sales at stores open at
least a year climbed 8.2 percent in the third quarter. The
company’s total revenue has climbed at least 11 percent for the
past 10 quarters.  “They continue to bring customers into the store,” Jason
Moser, an analyst at Motley Fool in Alexandria,  Virginia , said
in an interview. “They are offering more items to hit different
price points.”  The  shares  rose 11 percent to $94.05 at 4:55 p.m. in  New
York , after closing at $84.53. The stock gained 21 percent this
year through the close of regular trading today.  The company boosted its  forecast  for fiscal 2012 earnings
to as much as $2.52 a share from a previous estimate for profit
of as much as $2.47 a share. The average estimate of 27 analysts
was $2.47.  Whole Foods, founded in 1980, sells a private-label brand
called 365 Everyday Value to appeal to customers on a budget.
The brand includes items such as kettle-cooked potato chips,
all-natural soda and balsamic vinegar.  Sales climbed 14 percent to $2.73 billion in the quarter
ended July 1, matching analysts’ average estimate.  Whole Foods has more than 320 locations in the U.S., Canada
and the U.K. and has said it may expand to 1,000 stores in the
U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
