Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , the world’s best-
performing major oil producer, trimmed its production forecast
this year by 2.5 percent after guerrillas increased attacks on
infrastructure in  Colombia .  Average output will reach 780,000 barrels a day, according
to a presentation today on the Bogota-based company’s website.
The state-run company as recently as this month forecast average
output of 800,000 barrels a day.  “It’s surprising since it’s the first time they’ve changed
it,” said Juan David Pineros, an analyst at  Interbolsa SA (INTBOL) ,
Colombia’s largest brokerage, which recommends holding the
stock. “The first half of the year didn’t help much with
reaching that goal.”  Guerrillas have increased attacks on pipelines and oil
fields, raising transport costs and hampering production gains
at Ecopetrol. Rebels have targeted infrastructure as an armed
conflict with the Colombian government stretches into its fifth
decade. Colombia is  South America ’s third-largest crude
supplier.  Ecopetrol fell 2.5 percent to close at 4,870 pesos in
Bogota, the biggest drop in a month. The decline dragged
Colombia’s benchmark  COLCAP (COLCAP)  stock index down 1 percent to
1,642.76, the lowest close since June 29.  Second Quarter  Second-quarter profit fell at Ecopetrol as costs rose and
prices slid, missing analysts’ forecasts.  Net income slid 2.4 percent to 3.66 trillion pesos ($2.03
billion), from 3.75 trillion pesos a year earlier, the company
said yesterday after markets closed. Profit trailed the 4.17
trillion-peso average of four analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company still expects to reach targets to increase
production to 1 million barrels a day in 2015 and 1.3 million
barrels in 2020, Exploration and Production Vice President
Hector Manosalva said on a conference call with analysts.  Shares of Ecopetrol have returned 35 percent in U.S. dollar
terms this year, the best performance among major oil producers
with a market value of more than $50 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Venezuela and  Brazil  are South America’s largest crude
suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
