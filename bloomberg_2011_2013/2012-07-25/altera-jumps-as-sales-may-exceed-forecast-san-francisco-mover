Altera Corp. (ALTR) , a maker of
programmable chips, surged the most since 2004 after forecasting
sales that may beat analysts’ estimates this quarter on stronger
demand for wireless-communications gear.  Altera, based in  San Jose , California, yesterday predicted
third-quarter revenue will increase 2 percent to 6 percent from
the previous three months. That indicates sales of $474 million
to $493 million and compares with an average analyst estimate of
$470 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares rose $4.50, or 15 percent, to $35.17 in New York
trading after earlier trading as high as $36.20. Through
yesterday, they had lost 17 percent this year.  Altera Chief Executive Officer John Daane told analysts
yesterday that the telecommunications and wireless business had
led his company’s gains in the second quarter. Spending on
network improvements in China helped boost demand, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
