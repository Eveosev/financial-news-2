AOL Inc. (AOL) , owner of the  Huffington
Post  and TechCrunch, rose to its highest value since it was spun
out of  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  in 2009, after an increase in
advertising revenue and a one-time gain on a patent sale helped
the company return to a profit in the second quarter.  AOL advanced 7.2 percent to $29.48 at the close in  New
York . That’s the stock’s highest value since Nov. 25, 2009, when
it listed shares after being separated from Time Warner. The
stock has almost doubled this year.  Net income was $970.8 million, or $10.17 a share, compared
with a loss of $11.8 million, or 11 cents a share, a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Excluding some items, per-share profit was 23 cents, in line
with analysts’  average estimate  according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Since 2009 Chief Executive Officer  Tim Armstrong  has been
trying to transform AOL into an ad-based publishing business.
The company bought the Huffington Post for $315 million last
year and invested as much as $300 million in Patch, a local-news
division that Armstrong sees commanding up to $50 million in
sales this year.  “If you look from a year ago to today, the company is
healthier and stronger and in a good position,” Armstrong said
in a telephone interview.  News Channel  AOL continues to invest in the Huffington Post as the news
site plans to launch a live, online video news channel in a few
months, while the company’s blogs, TechCrunch and Engadget, will
expand outside the U.S., Armstrong said.  The company booked a $945.8 million gain in the second
quarter on the sale of patents. Sales dropped 2 percent to
$531.1 million. Analysts had estimated $519.2 million, according
to Bloomberg data.  Global display advertising rose 1.7 percent to $139.9
million, while the U.S. portion was little changed. Total
advertising improved 5.9 percent to $337.8 million.  AOL’s U.S. advertising revenue ranks fifth among major
competitors behind  Google Inc. (GOOG) , Yahoo Inc.,  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and
Microsoft Corp., according to research firm EMarketer Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
