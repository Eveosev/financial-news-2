Seed Co. (SEEDCO) , a Zimbabwean crop-seed
company with operations in 13 African nations, postponed the
opening of a cotton seed de-linting plant in Tanzania because of
building delays, the  Herald  reported.  The plant was scheduled to start production in June and
will now open in August, the Harare-based newspaper said, citing
Edworks Mhandu, managing director of Quton, a unit of Seed Co.
Quton will produce 15,000 metric tons of seed a year when the
plant opens, the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
