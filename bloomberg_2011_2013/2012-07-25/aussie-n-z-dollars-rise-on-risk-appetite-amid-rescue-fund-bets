The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars gained the most this month versus their U.S. counterpart
as speculation European policy makers will boost the firepower
of their rescue fund fueled appetite for riskier assets.  The Aussie rose against all but one of its 16 most-traded
peers and both currencies advanced against the greenback for the
first time in four days as concern eased that Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening. Commodities gained.  Australia’s dollar appreciated as much as 1.1 percent to
$1.0337, the largest intraday gain since June 29, yesterday in
 New York  before closing at $1.0307, up 0.8 percent. The Aussie
rose 0.8 percent to 80.57 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, strengthened as
much as 0.9 percent, also the biggest intraday jump since June
29, to 79.17 U.S. cents before closing at 78.90 cents, up 0.6
percent. It climbed 0.6 percent to 61.68 yen.  Investor demand for safety ebbed after European Central
Bank council member Ewald Nowotny said there were arguments
favoring giving the region’s rescue fund a banking license.
Granting a banking license to the European Stability Mechanism
would give it access to ECB lending, easing concern its 500
billion-euro ($608 billion) cash reserves won’t be enough if
Italy or  Spain  require assistance as the area’s debt crisis
progresses.  Implied volatility  on three-month options for Group-of-
Seven currencies declined for the first time in four days,
reaching 9.5 percent, according to the JPMorgan G7  Volatility
Index . It advanced to 9.83 percent the day before, the highest
level this month. The average over the past five years is 12.4
percent.  Decreased volatility makes investments of currencies of
nations with higher benchmark  interest rates  more attractive
because there is less risk of market moves erasing profits.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials rose for the
first time in four days, gaining 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
