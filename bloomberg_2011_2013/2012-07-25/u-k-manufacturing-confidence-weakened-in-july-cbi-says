U.K. manufacturing confidence
weakened in July as export prospects worsened, the  Confederation
of British Industry  said.  The quarterly gauge of factory optimism fell to minus 6
from 22 in April, the London-based employers’ group said in a
report today. A measure of confidence in export prospects fell
to minus 3 from 29, while hiring intentions declined to minus 2
from 16, the lowest since October.  The report comes amid an escalation of the euro-area crisis
and as data today showed  Britain’s recession  deepened in the
second quarter. The  International Monetary Fund  said last week
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  may need to ease his
fiscal squeeze and the  Bank of England  should expand stimulus
further if efforts to aid the economy fail to kick-start growth.  A separate monthly index of manufacturing orders rose to
minus 6 in July from minus 11 in June, while a measure of export
orders fell to minus 9 from minus 4. A gauge of the outlook for
output over the next three months rose to 11 from 7, the CBI
said. An index of stocks declined to 14 from 16.  Gross domestic product  declined 0.7 percent in the three
months through June, the third quarter of contraction and more
than the 0.2 percent drop forecast in a  Bloomberg News survey of
economists , the  Office for National Statistics  said today. The
slump was in part due to the record rainfall and an additional
public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
