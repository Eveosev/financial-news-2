concerns that  Europe ’s crisis is worsening and a slowing Chinese
economy may weaken demand.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn gained, erasing an earlier loss, on concern rains
forecast in the next two weeks in parts of the U.S. may fail to

$8.7525 a bushel, erasing an earlier 0.5 percent gain.  Palm oil  advanced for the first time in four days on
speculation that rains forecast in the U.S. may fail to ease
stress on drought-hit soybean crops, raising concern global
oilseed supplies will dwindle.  The October-delivery contract gained as much as 0.8 percent
to 2,950 ringgit ($927) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives

concern that slowing growth in China and Europe’s debt crisis

consumer of the commodity used in tires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
