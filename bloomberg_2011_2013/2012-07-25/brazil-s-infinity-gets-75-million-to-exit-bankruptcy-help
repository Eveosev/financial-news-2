Grupo Infinity, the sugar-cane
processing unit of Grupo Bertin, will get the final tranche of
$75 million of financing next month from seven U.S. funds as it
seeks to leave bankruptcy protection to tap cheaper local debt.  The Brazilian company received about half of the three-year
loans at the end of May and is using them to roll over short-
term debt and plant crops, Douglas Oliveira, president of Sao
Paulo-based Grupo Infinity, said yesterday in a telephone
interview.  Grupo Infinity filed a request in June to leave judicial
recovery, which is similar to bankruptcy protection, after
complying with two years of a restructuring plan, he said. The
company has been unable to access low-cost government-financing
lines that may carry annual interest rates of 5.5 percent since
it sought refuge from its creditors in May 2009.  Government loans “are much cheaper and adequate for cane
planting,” Oliveira said. “We’ll still have debt to pay but
the status will be lifted. This could happen mid-August.”  Grupo Infinity has relied on loans from outside  Brazil  to
replant sugar-cane fields and develop new ones for its mills
which are operating under capacity, according to Oliveira, who’s
cut 2,000 staff since arriving at the company in October 2010.
Two of its six facilities have been shut due to lack of
feedstock.  Grupo Bertin, a Lins, Brazil-based company, bought in March
2010 a 71 percent stake in Grupo Infinity, which was previously
known as Infinity Bio-Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
