Strabag SE (STR) , central  Europe ’s biggest
construction company, plummeted after cutting its guidance for
2012 earnings before interest and taxes by a third.  Shares  fell  5.9 percent to 17.84 euros at 5:30 p.m. close
of trading in Vienna, their biggest decline since Sept. 5.  The Ebit target of 300 million euros ($364 million), which
previously had been described as “more than ambitious,” now
“will not be achievable” and probably only will be reached by
“about two thirds,”  the company said in a statement today.  The reasons for the changed guidance are “delays of public
authorities in Central and Eastern Europe in dealing with
claims, especially in  Poland , the cautious valuation of some
construction projects and the ruinous price war in the raw
materials business,” Strabag said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
