OAO KamAZ, the Russian truckmaker
partly owned by  Daimler AG (DAI) , plans to reduce management and other
office personnel 30 percent as part of a program to cut costs,
spokesman Oleg Afanasyev said.  About 1,500 to 3,000 jobs will be eliminated, Afanasyev
said by phone from Naberezhnye Chelny, Tatarstan, where KamAZ is
based. KamAZ plans to reduce costs by 16.5 billion rubles ($503
million) by the end of next year, or by 18 percent compared with
last year, Afanasyev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
