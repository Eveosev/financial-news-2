Greece  plans 5 billion euros ($6
billion) from cut to pensions, social spending and lump-sum
retirement payments, part of the governmentâ€™s 11.5 billion-euro
package for the next two years, Ta Nea said, without citing
anyone.  A cap of about 2,000 euros a month may also be imposed on
state pensions, the Athens-based newspaper reported. The
government raised the figure for these cuts to 5 billion euros
from 4 billion euros as it struggles to find measures that total
11.5 billion euros for 2013 and 2014, the newspaper said.  Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras will present the
measures to Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and his coalition
partners today, before discussing them with European Union and
International Monetary Fund officials at a meeting tomorrow, Ta
Nea said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
