Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency, the country’s so-called bad bank, had a 247 million-euro
profit ($300 million) for 2011 after it wrote down the value of
its assets by less than the previous year.  The agency, based in Dublin, had an operating profit of
1.28 billion euros for 2011. It wrote down its loan book by 1.27
billion euros and a tax credit resulted in the gain, NAMA said
in a statement today. NAMA had an 1.18 billion-euro loss in  2010 
after taking an impairment charge of about 1.5 billion euros.  “Cash flow generation is vitally important for NAMA and
remains very strong,” Chief Executive Officer  Brendan McDonagh 
said in the statement. “The task before us is significant, but
I am optimistic that NAMA will succeed in doing the job set out
for it.”  NAMA, set up to remove toxic assets from Irish banks’
balance sheets, bought commercial property loans with a face
value of 74 billion euros from the country’s lenders for 32
billion euros. Irish commercial property prices were 66 percent
below their September 2007 peak at the end of June, Investment
Property Databank Ltd.  said  July 24. They fell 1.8 percent in
the last quarter.  The agency is seeking to sell 9 billion euros of property
loans and real estate to meet a 7.5 billion-euro debt-repayment
goal by the end of 2013, McDonagh said in an October interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
