OAO War & Peace Media Group, a
Russian television production company, may triple the price it’s
offering to buy back shares as the stock heads for the biggest
two-day jump on record.  The St. Petersburg-based media holding may pay 30 rubles
(91 cents) per share after increasing its offer from 7-10
rubles, Vitaly Fedko, the company’s general manager, said by
phone from  St. Petersburg  today. The buyback may start between
mid-August and mid-September, he said.  War & Peace surged 40 percent to 4.725 rubles as of 4:14
p.m. in Moscow, extending yesterday’s 40 percent gain. A close
at that level would mark its strongest two-day advance since
December 2011, when the stock was listed on the Micex Index.  The company decided to buy back shares after investors
complained about valuations, Fedko said. The stock slid 85
percent from the start of the year through July 23, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
