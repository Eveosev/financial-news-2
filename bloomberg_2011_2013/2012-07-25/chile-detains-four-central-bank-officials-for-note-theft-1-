Chile  has detained four central bank
officials for allegedly trying to steal 38 million pesos
($77,000) in notes that were scheduled to be destroyed.  The bank has turned over evidence to the police after
catching the employees attempting to steal the notes yesterday,
it said in separate statements posted on its website.  The bank has fired the accused and started legal action
against them, it said.  “The central bank of Chile profoundly regrets what
happened,” it said in one of the statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
