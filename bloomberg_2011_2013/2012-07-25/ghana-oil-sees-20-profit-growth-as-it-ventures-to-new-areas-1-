Ghana Oil Co. (GOIL) , which runs the
second-biggest network of gasoline stations in the country,
expects net income growth of 20 percent this year as it ventures
into new business areas.  The company, also known as Goil, is projecting volume
growth of 30 percent this year from about 5 percent last year as
it opens five new stations, Managing Director Patrick Akorli
told reporters in Accra, the capital today.  It will also open seven new stations in partnership with
Chase Petroleum, a company based in Accra, with operations
including the supply of fuel to ships in Takoradi, the capital
of Ghana’s Western region, where Jubilee oil-field production
activities are based, he said.  “In the area of aviation, we’ve now acquired two into-
plane facilities, which are starting operation this very
August,” Akorli said. “So we’re looking at higher volumes from
the retail sub-sector, aviation and then bunkering.”  Goil’s profit rose 7.8 percent to 2.63 million cedis ($1.34
million) in the first three months of the year, with revenue in
the period through March 31 increasing 14 percent to 173.5
million cedis, it said on May 2.  The company’s shares gained 2 percent to 52 pesewas by the
close in Accra, the capital, the highest since it listed on the
 Ghana  Stock Exchange on Nov. 19, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
