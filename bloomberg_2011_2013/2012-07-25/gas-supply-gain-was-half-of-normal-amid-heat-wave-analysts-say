U.S. natural-gas supplies expanded
by less than half the normal rate last week as a heat wave
boosted demand from  power plants  to run air conditioners,
according to analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories rose 26 billion cubic feet, or 0.8 percent, to
3.189 trillion cubic feet in the week ended July 20, based on
the median of 19 estimates. The five-year average stockpile
increase for the week is 61 billion, according to the  Energy
Department . Supplies climbed 48 billion a year earlier.  Hotter-than-normal weather this month spurred demand for
the fuel at power plants that had already started burning more
gas as prices dropped to a decade low in April. A below-average
supply gain last week will reduce the  gas surplus  for the 16th
straight period. Gas closed above $3 per million British thermal
units last week for the first time in six months.  “We’ve had a record level of heat this summer, as July is
tracking the forecasted level of about 24 percent hotter than
normal, while August is forecasted to be 6 percent hotter than
normal,” said Shiyang Wang, an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in
 New York . “A lot of the natural gas power demand is boosted by
this weather anomaly.”  Natural gas for futures gained 20.7 cents, or 7.2 percent,
to $3.081 per million British thermal units last week on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The August contract fell 10.4 cents,
or 3.3 percent, to $3.093 per million Btu as of 12:19 p.m.  Hot Weather  The high temperature in  Chicago  reached 99 degrees
Fahrenheit (37 Celsius) on July 17, 14 above normal, and the
next day New York climbed to 100 degrees, 16 more than usual,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
Dallas rose to 105 degrees on July 20, 8 above normal.  Cooling demand was 66 percent above the norm in the north-
central states and 11 percent above usual nationwide, according
to Weather Derivatives. U.S. air-conditioning needs will be 12
percent above normal in seven days ending Aug. 1, data from the
Belton, Missouri-based forecaster show.  Gas stockpiles in the week ended July 13 were 18 percent
above the five-year average for the period, department data
show. The supply surplus had widened to a six-year high of 61
percent at the end of March after the warmest winter on U.S.
record since 2000  reduced demand  while production gained.  The latest stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 20
billion to 35 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department’s weekly
supply report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
