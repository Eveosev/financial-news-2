Crop prices extended their declines
with soybeans dropping for a third day on the Chicago Board of
Trade as rains were forecast for parts of the U.S. Midwest.  Soybeans fell 1.9 percent to $15.395 a bushel, bringing the
three-day loss to 8.7 percent, after declining to $15.38, the
lowest since July 13. Wheat dropped 1.6 percent to $8.645 a
bushel and corn declined 0.9 percent to $7.7125 a bushel.
Soybean meal slumped 2.7 percent to $457 per 2,000 pounds.  Rain may fall in parts of Iowa and  Illinois  this week and
next, and the Midwest might get showers in the next 11 to 15
days, reducing severe moisture deficits from the most-severe
drought since 1988, Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland , said in a report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
