Gold production in  Ghana , Africa’s
second largest producer, rose 64 percent in the first quarter of
2012 as higher prices led companies to boost operations,
according to the country’s minerals commission.  Output in the period rose to 1.53 million ounces, Chief
Executive Officer Ben Aryee said in an interview in Accra, the
capital, yesterday.  “High gold prices are motivating mining firms to up
production,” he said. “New companies have also come on
stream.”  Prices rose to an average of $1,689 an ounce in the first
quarter from $1,389 an ounce for the same period a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The higher rates make it “profitable for mining companies
to mine low-grade ore,” Aryee said.  Bauxite rose to 180,519 tons in the first quarter from
93,776 tons a year earlier, Aryee said. Diamond output fell to
80,988 carats from 94,602 carats while manganese production
declined to 401,250 tons from 481,965 tons.  Companies including  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Newmont Mining
Corp. (NEM)  and Gold Fields Ltd. operate in the West African nation.
