Slovakia will reinstate a single
public health insurer system as it seeks to stop the inflow of
funds to private providers, Prime Minister  Robert Fico  said.  The Cabinet asked the Health Ministry to prepare by
September a plan on how to either buy the two private Slovak
insurers in the country from their owners or nationalize them,
Fico said. The government plans to complete the process next
year and the purchase costs will be covered by the sale of other
state assets, Fico told journalists in Bratislava today.  Fico, an advocate of increasing state influence in the
economy, has accused private health insurers of profiting from
public funds, which instead should be spent fully on treatment.
The government says a unified system will channel more funds for
health-care providers at a time when the country is striving to
reduce the budget  deficit .  Dovera, controlled by Czech-Slovak private equity group
Penta, has 1.4 million clients, while Union, a unit of Achmea
BV, has 400,000. Two-thirds of the 5.4 million Slovak population
is insured at the state-run General Health Insurance Company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
