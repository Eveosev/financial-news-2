Moody’s Investors Service  changed 
the long-term rating outlooks of six German states to negative
from stable, citing the close fiscal ties between the regions
and the federal government, whose outlook was downgraded two
days ago.  Six of  Germany ’s 16 states, or “Laender” in German --
Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Berlin, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt
and North Rhine-Westphalia -- have “extremely strong financial
and operational linkages” with the federal government, Moody’s
said on its website. The “negative outlooks on German Laender
mirror the negative outlook on Germany’s sovereign rating.”  Moody’s said factors influencing its decision are Germany’s
debt equalisation system that transfers revenue from richer to
poorer states and the size of the regions’ accumulated debt.  Berlin, the capital city that is also a state, does not
“presently” anticipate higher costs in selling bonds as a
result of Moody’s decision, the city’s finance senator, Ulrich Nussbaum, was cited as saying in an interview published in the
 Tagesspiegel  newspaper today. Moody’s rates the city’s bonds
Aa1.  Euro-area bonds fell after Moody’s lowered the outlook to
negative on July 23 for the top Aaa credit ratings of Germany,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg, citing “rising uncertainty”
over  Europe ’s debt crisis. Moody’s left  Finland  as the only
country in the 17-nation euro region with a stable outlook for
its top ranking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
