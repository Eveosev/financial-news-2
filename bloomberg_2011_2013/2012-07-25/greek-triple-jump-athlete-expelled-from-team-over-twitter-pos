The Greek Olympic Committee expelled
triple jump athlete Voula Papachristou from the national team
days ahead of the London Olympics over remarks she made on
Twitter concerning West Nile Virus and African immigrants in
 Greece .  The committee said comments posted by Papachristou on her
Twitter account were “contrary to the values and ideals of the
Olympics,” according  to a statement  on the website of the Greek
sports body.  Papachristou was removed from the team after she made
comments on her Twitter page on July 22.  “I would like to express my heartfelt apologies for the
unfortunate and tasteless joke I published on my personal
Twitter account,” Papachristou said in a message posted on her
 Twitter account . “I am sorry and ashamed for the negative
responses I triggered since I never wanted to offend anyone or
to encroach human rights.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
