A panel charged with outlining the
Japanese government’s growth strategy has updated a final draft
plan with a pledge to work with the Bank of  Japan  to combat
deflation and the strong yen.  The strategy, which will be reflected in next year’s
national budget, calls for spending to focus on clean energy,
health and agriculture, according to a copy of the draft
obtained by Bloomberg News. The ruling  Democratic Party  of Japan
will probably approve the document by the end of next week and
send it to the cabinet, Kohei Otsuka, who sits on the DPJ’s
financial and fiscal policy panel, told reporters yesterday.  “As well as working closely with the BOJ to do all in our
power to combat deflation, we will use all possible policies to
prevent a vicious cycle of a rising yen and deflation,” the
government said in the document.  The Japanese yen hit a postwar high of 75.35 per dollar on
October 31 and traded at 78.19 yen to the dollar at 6:52 p.m. in
 Tokyo  yesterday, with  Europe ’s sovereign debt woes boosting its
appeal as a haven for investors. A strong yen cuts the value of
Japanese exporters’ profits.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  “will not hesitate” to loosen monetary
policy should the world’s third-biggest economy face shocks that
weaken its outlook, Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Hirohide
Yamaguchi told business executives yesterday in western Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
