The euro rose for the first time in
six days against the dollar and the yen after European Central
Bank council member Ewald Nowotny said there are arguments in
favor of giving  Europe ’s rescue fund a banking license.  The 17-nation shared currency climbed 0.1 percent to
$1.2076 as of 8:08 a.m. London time, also advancing 0.1 percent
to 94.42 yen.  “I think there are pro arguments for this,” Nowotny, who
heads Austria’s central bank, said in an interview in his office
in Vienna yesterday.   Granting a banking license to Europe’s permanent bailout
fund, the European Stability Mechanism, would give it access to
ECB lending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
