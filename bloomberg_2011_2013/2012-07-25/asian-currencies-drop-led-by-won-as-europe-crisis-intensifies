Asian currencies weakened, led by
South Korea’s won, on concern Europe’s deepening debt crisis and
a slowdown in  China  will curb appetite for riskier emerging-
market assets.  The won fell to the lowest level in almost two weeks as
official reports showed Korean  consumer confidence  fell to a
five-month low in July while German business sentiment weakened.
Taiwan’s dollar touched a six-month low and China’s  yuan  reached
the weakest level since September as the  International Monetary
Fund  said the world’s second-largest economy faces significant
downside risks.  “Slower growth in China and Europe’s worsening debt
problems are going to exacerbate capital outflows in  emerging
markets ,” said Patrick Cheng, a foreign-exchange analyst at
Haitong International Securities Co. in  Hong Kong . “Some funds
are leaving China for the dollar as investors turn risk-
averse.”  The won fell 0.4 percent to 1,150.95 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.3 percent to NT$30.206 while India’s
rupee slid 0.2 percent to 56.225. The Philippine peso lost 0.3
percent to 42.185.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s currencies, reached the lowest level this month. Its
60-day historical volatility dropped to 3.75 percent from 3.76
percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks lost 1 percent,
capping a 3.9 percent slide in four days.  ‘Increasingly Shaky’  Global funds sold $748 million more South Korean, Taiwanese
and Thai stocks than they bought in the first two days of this
week, according to stock exchange data.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year bonds surged to a euro-area
record of 7.64 percent yesterday. The Ifo institute in Munich
said today that its business climate  index (MXAP)  dropped to 103.3, the
lowest reading since March 2010, from 105.2 in June. Greek Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras will meet the nation’s creditors from
the European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the
International Monetary Fund on July 27.  “The external environment seems increasingly shaky,”
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB, said in a note to clients today. “We expect a
continuation of the negativity in Asia” on concern slowing
growth will curb inflows, he wrote.  The yuan fell 0.04 percent to 6.3885 per dollar in Shanghai
as the People’s Bank of China weakened its  reference rate  for a
third day, by 0.14 percent to 6.3429.  China’s economy  relies too
much on investment, the IMF executive board said in a statement
today, urging leaders to boost consumption and channel citizens’
savings away from housing.  Rate Meetings  The baht climbed 0.2 percent to 31.73 per dollar after the
Bank of Thailand kept its one-day bond repurchase rate at 3
percent today, as predicted by all 14 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Policy makers in the Philippines will hold their overnight
rate at 4 percent tomorrow, according to 11 of 15 analysts in a
separate survey. Three predicted a cut of 25 basis points and
one forecast a 50 basis point, or 0.50 percentage point,
reduction.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah weakened 0.4 percent to 9,508
per dollar,  Malaysia ’s ringgit gained 0.2 percent to 3.1760 and
Vietnam’s dong was little changed at 20,885.  To contact the reporters on this story:
