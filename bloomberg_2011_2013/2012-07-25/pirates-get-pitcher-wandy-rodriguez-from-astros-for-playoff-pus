The Pittsburgh Pirates acquired
pitcher Wandy Rodriguez from the  Houston Astros  for three minor-
league prospects as they seek a Major League Baseball postseason
berth for the first time since 1992.  Rodriguez has a 7-9 record with a 3.79 earned run average
in 21 starts this season for an Astros team that has the worst
record in the majors at 34-64.  The 33-year-old left-hander now joins a Pirates’ club that
is in second place in the National League Central Division with
a 54-42 record, 2 1/2 games behind the Cincinnati Reds.
Pittsburgh has had 20 straight losing seasons since making the
NL Championship Series three years in a row from 1990-92.  “Wandy has quietly ranked among the upper echelon of major
league starting pitchers the last three seasons in ERA, innings
pitched and strikeouts, among other categories,” Pirates
General Manager Neal Huntington said in a  statement . “We
believe he will be a solid addition to our rotation for the
remainder of this season and beyond.”  Rodriguez, who has a 80-84 career record, ranks third among
National League left-handers in wins and strikeouts since the
start of the 2009 season, trailing only  Clayton Kershaw  of the
Los Angeles Dodgers and  Cole Hamels  of the Philadelphia
Phillies. He moves into a Pirates’ rotation that includes  Erik Bedard , A.J. Burnett,  James McDonald , Kevin Correia and Jeff Karstens.  The Pirates will pay Rodriguez $1.7 million for the rest of
this season, $8.5 million of his $13 million salary in 2013 and
$7.5 million in 2014 if a player option is exercised, MLB.com
said. Pittsburgh sent outfielder Robbie Grossman and left-handed
pitchers Rudy Owens and Colton Cain to Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
