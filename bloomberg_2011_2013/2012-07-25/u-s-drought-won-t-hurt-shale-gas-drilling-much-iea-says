The U.S. drought is unlikely to have
a long-lasting impact on the extraction of natural gas from
shale rock, especially as technology improves, the  International
Energy Agency ’s chief economist said.  Much of the Midwest had less than half the normal rain in
the past 30 days, National Weather Service data show. The
drought is putting pressure on drilling companies to conserve
the tens of millions of gallons of water they inject into
underground rock to free trapped gas and oil.  “This is a temporary thing, I don’t think it will cause a
long-lasting problem,”  Fatih Birol  said in an interview in
Paris today. “In general there’s a water problem in shale-gas
extraction, this can be addressed by using the best
technology.”  The potential for water contamination from the process of
hydraulic fracturing is also a “crucial issue” for the shale-
gas industry and this can be minimized by improving the
technology and reducing water use, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
