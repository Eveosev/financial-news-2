The  bull market  in American equities
is intact and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will probably
reach 1,380 within the next few months and rally from there,
according to Laszlo Birinyi.  Birinyi, president of research and money-management firm
Birinyi Associates Inc. in Westport,  Connecticut , said concern
about  second-quarter earnings  are overblown and too many
investors are worried about a “worst-case” outcome for stocks.
About 71 percent of the 216 companies in the  S&P 500  that have
reported results have exceeded analysts’ profit estimates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It will be, as it has been, a case of three steps
forward, two backward and trends lasting one day or five
hours,” wrote Birinyi in a note to clients. The former Salomon
Brothers Inc. equity trader, who described his forecast as
“1,380 later this summer, and then higher,” said in the note:
“Despite the frustrations of July with its volatility and
curious price activity, we remain optimistic.”  Birinyi was among the first to suggest buying stocks as the
U.S.  equity market  reached its bear market bottom in March 2009.
He stayed bullish when the S&P 500 declined as much as 16
percent in 2010 and through last year’s tumble to 1,099.23 on
Oct. 3 from 1,363.61 on April 29. The  fund manager  predicted in
May the S&P 500 will reach 1,500 in 2012, up 12 percent from its
current level.  July Swings  Equities in the benchmark gauge for American shares have
lost  1.8 percent  in July. They slipped 2 percent from the end of
June to July 12, climbed 3.1 percent to 1,376.51 on July 19, and
have retreated 2.8 percent since then to 1,337.89 yesterday.  Stock markets advanced 7 percent on average during the
third quartile of three of the last five bull markets, according
to Birinyi. That would mean the S&P 500 will climb to 1,380, or
a 3.1 percent advance from yesterday’s close, by September,
Jeffrey Yale Rubin, an analyst at Birinyi, said in a telephone
interview yesterday.  Should the market track the other two rallies, the S&P 500
could reach 1,700 in a year or two, Rubin said, citing the
firm’s March report.  Birinyi said he sold shares of  Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL)  from the
firm’s model fund for growth investors, while adding  PepsiCo (PEP) 
Inc., according to the note. The New York-based clothes retailer
has dropped 20 percent to $143.08 a share from its March high
this year. PepsiCo, the world’s largest snack-food maker, has
increased 13 percent to $70.30 from its low in March of $62.28.  “The  U.S. economy  continues to sputter,  Europe  is in
disarray and  China  remains a question mark, but even with all
that, the market is up almost 7 percent” in 2012, Birinyi wrote
in the note. “With a touch of dividends, that translates into
an annualized gain approximating 15 percent.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
