Egypt ’s next government will include
some of its current ministers as well as younger politicians to
represent different segments of society, the official Middle
East News Agency cited Prime Minister Hisham Qandil as saying.  Ministerial portfolios won’t be merged, while a new
portfolio for drinking water and sewerage will be introduced to
improve public services, Qandil said, according to MENA. Talks
on the formation of a new Cabinet are expected to be completed
next week, Yasser Ali, a spokesman for President Mohamed Mursi,
told reporters today.  Qandil, the little-known irrigation minister in the
outgoing government headed by Kamal el-Ganzouri, was appointed
as premier by Mursi yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
