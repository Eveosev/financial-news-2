German stocks advanced, rebounding
from the biggest three-day drop since November, as a rally in
carmakers offset a worse-than-expected decline in business
confidence in July and lower-than-forecast U.S. new home sales.  Daimler AG (DAI)  rose 4.1 percent as it reported increased sales
and stuck to its goal of keeping earnings steady.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,
the world’s second-largest carmaker, added 1.3 percent.  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  slumped 4.1 percent as second-quarter profit missed
analysts’ estimates.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  gained 0.3 percent to 6,406.52 at the close
in  Frankfurt , after earlier rising as much as 1.3 percent. The
measure has increased 7.3 percent from its 2012 low on June 5 as
euro-area leaders eased repayment terms for Spanish lenders and
central banks took measures to support growth. The broader HDAX
Index also added 0.3 percent today.  “Technically, today’s rise is just a firewall as the index
corrects upwards but the bad news just keeps on coming,” said
Duarte Caldas, a market strategist at IG Markets in Lisbon. “I
do not expect a reversion of the negative trend in equities
markets.”  German business confidence fell for a third straight month
in July to the lowest in more than two years as the worsening
sovereign debt crisis damped the outlook for economic growth and
company earnings.  The Ifo institute in Munich said its  business climate
index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped to 103.3
from 105.2 in June. That’s the lowest reading since March 2010.
Economists predicted a decline to 104.5, according to the median
of 35 forecasts in a Bloomberg News  survey .  Home Sales  Demand for  new U.S. homes  unexpectedly dropped in June from
a two-year high, indicating the housing recovery will be uneven.
Purchases decreased to a 350,000 annual rate, down 8.4 percent
from the prior month and the weakest since January, the Commerce
Department reported today in  Washington . The median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey of 74 economists was 372,000.  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras will meet with
representatives of the European Commission, the  European Central
Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  -- the so-called troika
-- on July 27, amid concern the country will fail to abide by
the commitments needed to obtain continued financial aid.  Spain’s 10-year bond yields surged to a euro-area record of
7.64 percent yesterday, prompting policy makers to deny an
international bailout was being prepared for the country.  China ’s slowing economy faces significant downside risks
and relies too much on investment, the IMF said in an annual
review. The Washington-based lender repeated an assessment that
the  yuan  is “moderately” undervalued, and urged leaders to
increase consumption and channel citizens’ savings away from
housing.  Carmakers Gain  Daimler rose 4.1 percent to 37.62 euros. The world’s third-
largest maker of  luxury vehicles  said sales in the second-
quarter rose 10 percent to 28.9 billion euros ($35 billion),
even as profit declined 13 percent as spending to expand the
lineup of Mercedes-Benz compact cars offset higher deliveries.  Daimler plans to raise vehicle deliveries in 2012 and match
last year’s operating profit from ongoing business of 9 billion
euros. The company also reiterated a goal of boosting the
operating margin at the Mercedes-Benz Cars division to 10
percent of sales in 2013.  Volkswagen, the world’s second-largest carmaker, jumped 1.3
percent to 133.65 euros. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the
world’s largest maker of luxury vehicles, climbed 1.3 percent to
55.89 euros.  A gauge of auto companies was the best performer of the 19
industry groups on the Euro Stoxx 600 Index.  Deutsche Bank slid 4.1 percent to 22.51 euros. Germany’s
biggest bank said shortly before the close of trading yesterday
that it will reduce risk to meet a 2013 capital-ratio goal after
second-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates on expenses
tied to a weaker euro.  Henkel AG & Co KGaA (HEN3) , a manufacturer of industrial,
commercial and consumer chemical products, fell 0.9 percent to
45.94 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
