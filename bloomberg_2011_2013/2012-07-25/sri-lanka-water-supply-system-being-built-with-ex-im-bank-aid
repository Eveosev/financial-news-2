The Export-Import Bank approved
almost $65 million in U.S. financing for  Sri Lanka  to build and
design a water-supply system from Pasadena, California-based
 Tetra Tech Inc. (TTEK)  to provide more drinking water for the country.  The project for the Badulla, Haliela and Ella areas of Sri
Lanka will include a new dam, upgraded water treatment plants,
storage tanks, pumping stations and transmission and
distribution pipelines, Ex-Im Bank said in a statement. About
400 U.S. jobs will be supported by the transaction, it said.  “Not only does this transaction stimulate U.S. job
creation but it also contributes directly to the quality of life
in Sri Lanka,” Ex-Im Bank Chairman  Fred Hochberg  said in a
statement. “This project will bring potable water to thousands
of those who need it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
