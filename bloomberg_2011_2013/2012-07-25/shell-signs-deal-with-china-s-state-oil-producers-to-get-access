Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
biggest oil company, expanded cooperation with two of China’s
state-backed producers, giving it more access to reserves in the
world’s second-largest economy.  The London-based company signed two offshore production-
sharing contracts with  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  for the Yinggehai basin and
amended a production sharing agreement with China National
Petroleum Corp. to allow the development of tight gas reserves,
Shell said in a statement yesterday. It also agreed to explore
blocks off Gabon with Cnooc.  “These new projects in partnership with Chinese companies
are the latest showcase of our China strategy to work with our
Chinese counterparts both in China and globally to help meet the
country’s energy needs,” Lim Haw-Kuang, head of Shell in  China ,
said in a statement.  In the offshore Yinggehai blocks, Shell will conduct
seismic surveys and hold a 100 percent working interest in the
exploration phase that will be reduced to 49 percent if there is
a development, it said. In Gabon, Cnooc acquired a 25 percent
interest in two exploration blocks and will reimburse Shell for
some past costs.  Shell signed China’s first shale gas production sharing
contract in March as China tries to unlock resources similar to
those that sparked the U.S. natural gas boom. China may have 50
percent more shale gas reserves than the U.S., according to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
