Sweet Louisiana oil premiums
strengthened as West Texas Intermediate’s discount to Brent oil
widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent increased 49 cents to $15.41
a barrel based on September settlement prices. When Brent gains
versus WTI, it typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades
that compete with foreign oils priced against the European
benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet increased $1 to $16.50 a barrel over
WTI at 4:06 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
added 50 cents to $17.50.  Poseidon’s premium gained 25 cents to $9.25 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon rose 50 cents to $9 over WTI. Mars Blend
increased 75 cents to $10.25 a barrel over the U.S. benchmark.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
decreased 45 cents to $11.30.  Bakken oil’s discount to WTI was unchanged at $3 a barrel.
Western Canada Select’s discount widened $5 to $19 below WTI.  Syncrude’s premium was steady at $3 over WTI. Syncrude is a
synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in  Alberta  into
refinery-ready crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
