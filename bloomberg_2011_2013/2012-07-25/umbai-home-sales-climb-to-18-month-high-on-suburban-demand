Mumbai’s residential home  sales 
climbed to an 18-month high in the fiscal first quarter as new
projects in the suburbs boosted demand, according to Liases
Foras Real Estate Rating & Research Pvt.  Sales in Mumbai,  India ’s most expensive  property market ,
rose 7 percent to 9.79 million square feet in the three months
ended June 30 from the previous quarter, the highest since
December 2010, said  Pankaj Kapoor , founder of  Liases Foras , a
Mumbai-based real estate research company. The value of homes
sold in the city fell 17 percent to 71.06 billion rupees ($1.26
billion), Kapoor said.  “Although sales in Mumbai have improved in terms of number
of units, the value of stock sold has declined, suggesting that
cheaper properties available in the extended suburbs of the city
were major contributors of this improvement,” Kapoor said in a
phone interview from Mumbai yesterday.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , India’s biggest mortgage
lender, predicts an increase in home loans of as much as 20
percent as a further half a percentage point interest-rate cut
will spur demand in smaller cities. The forecast shows the
central bank has leverage to stimulate housing demand in an
economy growing at the slowest pace in almost a decade.  Unsold Inventory  Credit Suisse Group AG and  Yes Bank Ltd. (YES)  also forecast the
 Reserve Bank  of India, which in April cut the repurchase rate to
8 percent from 8.50 percent in its first reduction since 2009,
will lower it to 7.50 percent by Dec. 31 to boost growth. The
central bank left the  rate  unchanged in the mid-quarterly
monetary policy review in June, and all 11 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg expect no change at its next appraisal on July 31.  Sales in Bangalore gained the most, increasing 56 percent
to 16.48 million square feet in the quarter, while prices
climbed 5.5 percent  In Mumbai, the number of months needed to clear stock at
the existing absorption rate was at 37 months, Kapoor said. A
“healthy market” normally maintains about eight months of
inventory, he said.  Unsold units in the city declined by 5.9 percent to 121.97
million square feet, according to Liases Foras, whose clients
include Housing Development. The weighted average selling  price 
rose to a record 11,154 rupe2es a square foot, the data showed.  Sales in the National Capital Region, which includes  New
Delhi  and its surrounding areas, fell 31 percent to 21.33
million square feet in the quarter, Liases Foras’s data showed.
The weighted average selling  price  rose to 3,729 rupees a square
foot, 4.5 percent higher than the previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
