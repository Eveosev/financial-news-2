 International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , the world’s largest computer-services provider, is
offering $1 billion of 10-year dollar-denominated bonds in its
first sale of that maturity this year.  The debt may yield 65 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  The securities may be rated Aa3, the fourth-highest level
of investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service, and proceeds
will go toward general corporate purposes, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the terms are private.  IBM last sold 10-year bonds in October 2011, issuing $500
million of 2.9 percent debt to yield 62.5 basis points more than
benchmarks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
securities traded at 108.34 cents on the dollar to yield 1.91
percent on July 19, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG
are managing the sale for the Armonk, New York-based company,
the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
