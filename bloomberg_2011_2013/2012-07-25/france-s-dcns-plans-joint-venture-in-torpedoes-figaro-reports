French military shipbuilder DCNS
expects to play a role in pan-European consolidation, beginning
with a plan to create a 50-50 joint venture in torpedoes with
Atlas, 49 percent owned by European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. and 51 percent by shipyard TKMS, DCNS Chief Executive
Officer Patrick Boissier was cited as saying by Le Figaro.  DCNS expects the joint venture to be created by the first
half of 2013, Bossier told French newspaper Le Figaro in an
interview. A program to build six Barracuda submarines to
replace existing French nuclear attack submarines will guarantee
the survival of DCNS’s site at Cherbourg, and the first
Barracuda is already under construction, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
