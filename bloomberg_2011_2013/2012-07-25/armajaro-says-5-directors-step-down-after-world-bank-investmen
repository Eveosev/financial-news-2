Armajaro Trading Group Ltd., a
supplier of sugar, cocoa and coffee, said five directors stepped
down from its board following an investment by the  World Bank ’s
private-lending arm.  Pietro Dall’Acqua, Andrew Slinger, Paul Monk, Jasbir Singh
and Ana Vohringer Wilks are no longer on the board, according to
Richard Ryan, chief executive officer at the London-based
company. Wilks, who was also head of coffee, has left Armajaro,
Ryan confirmed.  The changes were required by the International Finance
Corp., which invested $55 million and took a 6 percent stake in
Armajaro in May, Ryan said. The IFC also plans to appoint two
directors to the U.K. company’s board, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
