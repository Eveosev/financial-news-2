OAO Mobile TeleSystems dropped to
the lowest level in two weeks as Russia’s Foreign Ministry said
it is “concerned” after company officials were arrested in
Uzbekistan at the end of June.  MTS shares lost 0.8 percent to 223.81 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the lowest since July 12.  Russia has made Uzbekistan “officially aware” of its
concern, according to the statement on the Foreign Ministry’s
website. The wife of the arrested head of MTS’s Uzbek unit has
written a letter to Russian President  Vladimir Putin , the
statement said.  Uzbek authorities froze the license of MTS’s local unit for
10 days on July 17, citing violations and tax claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
