     July 25 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
Corp. obtained a record-low 1.875 percent coupon on $1 billion
of 10-year bonds, the least for dollar-denominated debt of that
maturity.  The world’s largest computer-services provider sold the
debt at 98.398 cents on the dollar to yield 2.053 percent, or a
relative yield of 65 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The coupon beat the previous 2 percent record held by 3M
Co.’s 10-year notes sold on June 21, Bloomberg data show. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “The yield is reflective of the overall bond market
environment, with Treasuries sitting at an all-time record-low
yield,” said Anthony Valeri, a market strategist in  San Diego 
at  LPL Financial , in a telephone interview. “IBM picked the
perfect time to come to market.”  The benchmark 10-year Treasury note’s yield dropped as low
as 1.38 percent today.  IBM also shares the record low with Sysco Corp. for three-
year debt with its 0.55 percent bonds due February 2015.  The new debt may be rated Aa3, the fourth-highest level of
investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service. Proceeds will go
toward general corporate purposes, said  Doug Shelton , an IBM
spokesman, who declined to comment further.  ‘Fresh Name’  BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG
managed the sale, according to Bloomberg data.  IBM last sold 10-year bonds in October 2011, issuing $500
million of 2.9 percent debt to yield 62.5 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. The Armonk, New York-based
company’s securities traded at 108.34 cents on the dollar to
yield 1.91 percent on July 19, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  IBM is “a fresh name in the 10-year space,” Valeri said.
“You give the market a liquid 10-year issue, and it kind of
sells itself when you have a solid name like IBM.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
