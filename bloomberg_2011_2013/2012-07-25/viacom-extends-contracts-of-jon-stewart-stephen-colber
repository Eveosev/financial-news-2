Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s Comedy Central said it
has signed contract extensions with  Jon Stewart  and Stephen Colbert, hosts of the network’s late-night shows.  Stewart’s extension commits him to “The Daily Show with
Jon Stewart” through mid-2015 as executive producer, writer and
host, New York-based Comedy Central said today in an e-mailed
statement. Colbert’s extension keeps him at “The Colbert
Report” until the end of 2014 as executive producer, writer and
host.  Among late-night shows, Stewart’s program delivers the
biggest audience in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic that
advertisers target, the network said. The two shows are also the
only late-night series to post increases in viewing with that
age group, Comedy Central said, citing Nielsen data.  Viacom, controlled by Chairman Sumner Redstone, gained 0.4
percent to $45.46 at 12:54 p.m. in  New York  trading. The stock
had declined 0.3 percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
