Bayerische Landesbank  and
Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, two state-owned German
lenders, won final European Union approval for government help
after they agreed to restructuring plans.  BayernLB must repay 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in state
aid over the next seven years, the European Commission said. It
also approved a restructuring plan that will shrink the bank’s
balance sheet by half compared with levels in 2008 and reduce
the bank’s operations outside  Germany  in project finance and
real estate. BayernLB has also agreed to avoid acquisitions and
dividends, the EU said.  NordLB has agreed to shift its business toward more stable
business segments, to remain solvent and achieve an appropriate
return on equity in return for EU approval for 3.3 billion euros
of restructuring aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
