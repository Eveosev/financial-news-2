All Blacks center  Conrad Smith  will
miss at least the first two matches of the southern hemisphere
rugby championship following treatment for an eye injury.  Smith, who’s played 58 Tests for  New Zealand , underwent two
procedures to repair a detached retina in his left eye following
the Wellington Hurricanes’ final match of the Super Rugby
season, Hurricanes team doctor Ian Murphy said.  “They both went well and he is now recovering at home,”
Murphy said in an e-mailed statement. “At this stage he is
expected to be out of training for six weeks.”  That timeframe would put Smith, 30, out of New Zealand’s
matches against Australia on Aug. 18 in Sydney and a week later
in Auckland. After the Sept. 1 travel bye, the All Blacks are
then scheduled to host tournament newcomer  Argentina  on Sept. 8
in Wellington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
