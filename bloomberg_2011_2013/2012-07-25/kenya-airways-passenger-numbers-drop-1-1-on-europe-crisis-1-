Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-biggest carrier, said it flew fewer passengers
and less cargo in the fiscal first quarter amid reduced flights
to Europe because of that region’s debt crisis.  The number of passengers declined 1.1 percent to 841,238 in
the three months through June, the Nairobi-based airline said in
an e-mailed statement today. Revenue passenger kilometers fell
4.5 percent to 2.2 million, it said.  “Capacity offered into Europe shrunk by 18.8 percent
compared to the same quarter of the prior year due to capacity
rationalization occasioned by the euro zone crisis,” it said.  KQ, as the airline is known, plans to triple the size of
its fleet and more than double the number of routes it flies
over the next 10 years as part of an expansion plan. In May, the
company sold 14.5 billion shillings ($172 million) of stock to
existing shareholders as part of a plan to raise $3.6 billion to
fund the project.  The amount of cargo handled by the carrier fell 3.9 percent
to 14,683 metric tons, it said.  “Exports from  Kenya  dropped on account of unfavourable
weather patterns in April and market capacity,” KQ said.
“Volumes from Europe shrunk reflecting the volatile economic
conditions.”  South African Airways  and Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise are
sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest carriers by passenger numbers,
according to the  International Air Transport Association .  To contact the reporter on this story:
