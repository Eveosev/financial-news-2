OAO Severstal (SVST) ,  Russia ’s second-
largest steelmaker, agreed to produce and supply large-diameter
pipes through 2016 for natural-gas exporter  OAO Gazprom. (GAZP)   Severstal will deliver tubes for deepwater pipelines and
for transporting hydrogen sulfide gas, the Cherepovets-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The pipes will go to Gazprom’s projects in Siberia,
including on the Yamal Peninsula, and in Russia’s Far East, and
many will span areas of active tectonic faults, according to the
statement. The country’s largest steel producer is Evraz Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
