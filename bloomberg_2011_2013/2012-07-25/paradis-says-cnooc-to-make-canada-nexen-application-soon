Cnooc Ltd. (883)  will soon apply to the
Canadian government for approval of its $15.1 billion bid for
 Nexen Inc. (NXY) , Industry Minister Christian Paradis said, which will
start a 45-day review period for the transaction.  “I understand that Cnooc will present an application
shortly,” Paradis told reporters in Ottawa today. “I can’t
speculate more than this.”  Under Canadian law, Paradis will have 45 days to make a
decision on the merger, and can extend that deadline by another
30 days if more information is needed.  “As the prime minister said very clearly yesterday, we
cannot prejudge on any case,” Paradis said. “We will
scrutinize the case very closely and it has to be for the net
benefit of this country.”  Paradis said yesterday in  Montreal  that “a review is
ongoing” of the merger. A spokesman for Cnooc, Peter Hunt, said
in an e-mail today the application has not yet been submitted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
