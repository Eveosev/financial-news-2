Nigerian Breweries Plc (NB) , the
country’s biggest brewer by market value, advanced for a third
day after reporting profit increased in the second quarter.  The stock gained 0.9 percent to 117.50 naira by the close
in Lagos, its highest since at least January 2002.  Net income rose to 19.38 billion naira ($121 million) from
18.96 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based company said
today in a statement published on the website of the Nigerian
Stock Exchange. Revenue jumped 24 percent to 136.5 billion
naira. Bombings and attacks by Boko Haram Islamists are curbing
beer sales in northern  Nigeria , Chief Executive Officer Nicolaas Vervelde said on May 10.  “It’s a slight improvement over its performance last year,
but it’s good since it is not a decline,” David Adonri, chief
executive officer of Lambeth Trust and Investment Company, said
by phone from Lagos today. “Despite the challenges they are
facing in the north, they are still able to improve on their
profit, and that’s why the market is reacting positively to
it.”  Nigerian Breweries shares have risen 24 percent this year,
compared with an 12 percent increase in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange  All-Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
