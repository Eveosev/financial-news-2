Palm oil  gained on renewed concern
that the worst U.S. drought in more than 50 years will hurt the
production of soybeans, reducing global oilseed supplies and
increasing demand for the tropical commodity.  The October-delivery contract advanced 0.9 percent to close
at 2,951 ringgit ($930) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. Earlier, the contract fell as much as 1 percent.  Midwest temperatures may remain 5 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit
above normal, and while showers were forecast over the next two
weeks, rains will still be below normal, Joel Widenor, co-
founder of Commodity Weather Group LLC, said in a note
yesterday. The U.S. is the largest producer of soybeans, which
like the palm fruit can be crushed to provide an oil for foods
and fuel.  “The story on the drought is still there,” Ivy Ng, an
analyst at  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) , said in Kuala Lumpur. “The
market will remain focused on the weather and the crop
development in the U.S.”  About 31 percent of the U.S. soybean crop was in good or
excellent  condition  as of July 22, down from 34 percent a week
earlier and the lowest for the date since 1988, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said July 23.  December-delivery  soybean oil  climbed 1.8 percent to 53.25
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Most-active
soybeans, which have rallied 32 percent this year as the Midwest
drought deepened, climbed 1.1 percent to $15.87 a bushel.  Palm oil for January delivery fell 0.7 percent to close at
7,652  yuan  ($1,197) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for the same month dropped 0.6 percent to end at
9,336 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
