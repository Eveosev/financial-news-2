Shipping Corp. of India  said a
joint-venture with the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines
will end after sanctions against the Iranian company crimped the
entity’s ability to trade.  “Between the two promoters, there has been an
understanding reached that the assets of the company will be
split between the promoters and it will cease operation,”
Sabyasachi Hajara, chairman of Mumbai-based SCI, said by phone
today.  SCI, which is majority owned the Indian government, has 49
percent of the venture. IRISL is the holder of the remainder,
Hajara said. The precise details and timing of the split have
yet to be decided, he said.  IRISL’s assets are blocked and frozen in the U.S., which is
intensifying sanctions targeting the Persian Gulf state’s
nuclear development.  Iran  says its program is for civilian
purposes.  The person who answered the phone in Tehran-based IRISL’s
commercial department declined to give his name and said he was
unable to comment today. He referred further questions to the
company’s public affairs office and nobody answered the phone
there outside normal office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
