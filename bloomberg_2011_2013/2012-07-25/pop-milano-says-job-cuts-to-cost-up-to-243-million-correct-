(Corrects the name of chairman in third paragraph.)  Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl ,
 Italy ’s oldest cooperative bank, expects as much as 200 million
euros ($243 million) of one-time costs related to planned job
cuts as the lender seeks to boost profit.  Italy’s sixth-biggest bank may set aside 180 million euros
to 200 million euros to cover the costs, Chief Executive Officer
Piero Montani said during a conference call today. The lender
plans to cut 700 jobs over the next three years, 25 percent of
them managers.  Montani and Chairman  Andrea Bonomi  are reorganizing the
bank to boost profit and strengthen capital because it must
repay 500 million euros of state aid obtained in 2009. The
executives said the bank may sell assets unrelated to its main
business.  “We welcome the focus on operating costs and the
strengthening of the capital position,” Manuela Meroni, an
analyst at Banca IMI SpA, wrote in a note today. “The scenario
on the asset quality seems to be more prudent compared with that
incorporated in our estimates.”  The job reductions will save about 65 million euros by
2015, the bank said in a statement late yesterday. Popolare
Milano plans to reduce its administrative expenses by 12
percent, bringing the cost-to-income ratio to 56 percent in
2015. The bank also is carrying out an impairment test, which
may lead to writedowns of its goodwill.  The bank rose 1.9  percent  to 32.2 euro cents as of 12:15
p.m. in Milan trading, giving the company a market value of 1.04
billion euros.  Popolare Milano is targeting net income of 270 million
euros in 2015, compared with 614 million euros of losses in
2011. It expects revenue to rise to 1.76 billion euros at the
end of 2015 from 1.05 billion euros, while operating profit
should reach 780 million euros from 307 million euros.  “The 2015 net profit target is broadly achievable,”
Mediobanca SpA’s analysts, who have an outperform recommendation
on the stock, wrote in a report today.  Popolare Milano’s  net income  rose to 64.3 million euros in
the first three months of the year from 42.3 million euros a
year earlier, it said May 15. Popolare Milano’s core tier 1
ratio, which was at 8.3 percent at the end of March, is expected
to exceed 9 percent by the end of 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
