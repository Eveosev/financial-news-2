Mauritius’s central bank will
reallocate some of a 600 million-euro ($728 million) credit
facility offered to struggling exporters if demand for the loans
is insufficient, Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said.  The central bank “will start redeploying progressively
some of the funds earmarked for the special line of credit if,
for whatever reason, the demand is not there,” Bheenick said in
a speech posted on the Port Louis-based Bank of Mauritius’s
website today.  Mauritian businesses from manufacturing to tourism are
struggling to cope with a prolonged financial crisis in  Europe 
and a declining euro, which accounts for about 41 percent of the
island nation’s foreign-currency income. The central bank said
on July 3 it will provide the credit facility in euros, dollars
and British pounds, allowing refinancing of existing Mauritian-
rupee loans.  “The global economic downturn is impacting on our exports,
our employment and our standard of living,” Bheenick said.
“This difficult and delicate situation requires that all
stakeholders look beyond their narrow self-interest and share in
the pains of adjusting to the new realities.”  The Indian Ocean nation’s economy is forecast to expand 3.5
percent this year, the slowest pace in three years, according to
Statistics Mauritius. Tourism arrivals for the six months
through June rose 0.5 percent from a year earlier, missing a 1.6
percent forecast set by the data agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
