“Sell in May and go away” has
persisted as a profitable market-timing strategy for stock
investors, according to a new study.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the average percentage-point
gaps in stock performance between the six months ended in April
and the next six months, as presented in the study. The figures
cover MSCI Inc.’s local-currency indexes of 23 developed markets
for November 1998 through April 2012.  Every index did better in the November-April period, led by
MSCI Ireland, which had a differential of 17.9 points. Fourteen
emerging-market indexes were included in the research, and all
of them showed the same tendency.  “The Sell in May effect occupies a special place among
seasonal anomalies,” University of Miami Assistant Professor
Sandro C. Andrade and two of his colleagues wrote in the  study ,
posted yesterday on the Social Science Research Network. That’s
because it only takes two trades a year to make money, unlike
other patterns that require more frequent buying and selling.  The research by Andrade, Vidhi Chhaochharia and Michael E.
Fuerst followed up on a study published in 2002 by the American
Economic Review, an academic journal. The earlier work tracked
the disparities in the 37 MSCI indexes from their inception, as
early as 1970, through October 1998.  In the earlier period, the gap averaged 8.7 points. The
differential climbed to 10.5 points after excluding Argentina
and  Brazil , which experienced hyperinflation. The overall
average in the new study was 9.7 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
