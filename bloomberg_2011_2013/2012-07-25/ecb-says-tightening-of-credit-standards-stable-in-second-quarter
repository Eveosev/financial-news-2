The  European Central Bank  said euro-
area banks tightened credit standards in the second quarter at
the same pace as in the first, and they expect loan demand to
decline in the three months through September.  “Despite the re-intensification of the sovereign debt
crisis in the second quarter of 2012, the July 2012 bank lending
survey shows that the net tightening of banks’ credit standards
was broadly stable at the euro-area level in the second quarter
of 2012 compared with the first quarter, both for loans to
enterprises and for loans to households,” the ECB said in its
quarterly report published in  Frankfurt  today.  The ECB has flooded banks with more than 1 trillion euros
($1.2 trillion) in cheap three-year loans and eased collateral
requirements to encourage lending. The ECB said today banks’
access to retail and wholesale funding deteriorated at a slower
pace in the second quarter than at the end of 2011, while
tensions on sovereign-debt markets impacted funding conditions
“substantially.”  “Euro-area banks expect a similar degree of net tightening
in credit standards for loans to enterprises, and a further
decline for housing loans and for  consumer credit ,” the ECB
said.  Euro-area banks reported “a significant fall” in demand
for company loans in the second quarter, which was less
pronounced than in the first three months of the year, the ECB
said. Financial institutions expect “a continued decline” in
net demand for loans, both for enterprises and households,
according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
