Radware Ltd. (RDWR) , an Israeli technology
company, sank the most in 19 months in New York after  Juniper
Networks Inc. (JNPR)  announced a licensing deal with competitor
Riverbed Technology Inc.  Radware, the Tel Aviv-based developer of technology to help
networks run more efficiently, declined 11 percent to $32.69 by
12:58 p.m. in New York, poised for the biggest retreat since
December 2010. The slump lead declines on the Bloomberg Israel-
US Equity Index of the most traded Israeli companies in New
York.  Juniper, the world’s No. 2 maker of networking gear,
announced yesterday after the market closed a $75 million deal
with Riverbed to license products that help boost application
performance. Radware said its partnership with Juniper, which
was announced in October, remains intact.  “The reason its shares are reacting like this is because
some people had expectations that Juniper would go with Radware
for this deal,”  Joseph Wolf , an analyst for Barclays Plc in
said by phone from Tel Aviv.  To contact the reporters on this story:
