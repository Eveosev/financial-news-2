Maynilad Water Services Inc. is
nearing a deal with the Japanese trading company Marubeni to
sell a 20 percent stake in the Manila water provider for about
$400 million, DMCI Holdings President Isidro Consunji said.  The Philippine builder will use proceeds from the Maynilad
stake sale to help fund an expansion in power, infrastructure
and mining, Consunji said today. Marubeni may complete the
acquisition by September, Chief Operating Officer Herbert
Consunji said.  DMCIâ€™s stake in Maynilad, jointly owned with  Metro Pacific
Investments Corp. (MPI) , would drop by 16 percent after the deal to 25
percent. DMCI would receive about 14 billion pesos from the
sale, the COO said. Metro Pacific would give up a 4 percent
stake in the deal, the Philippine Daily Inquirer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
