9:36 a.m. London time. It dropped 0.2 percent to $1.5475.   Gross domestic product shrank 0.7 percent from the first
quarter, when it dropped 0.3 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said in London. Economists forecast a 0.2 percent
decline, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
