China ’s  yuan  fell to the lowest
level since September as the central bank weakened the
currency’s reference rate for a third day amid concern economic
growth will moderate further on  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The  International Monetary Fund  said China’s slowing
economy faces significant downside risks and repeated an
assessment that the yuan is “moderately” undervalued. The
 Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks the greenback against six major
currencies, climbed for a fourth day after estimates by Markit
Economics yesterday showed that euro-area services and
manufacturing contracted for a sixth month. The People’s Bank of
China set the yuan’s fixing at the weakest since Nov. 30.  “Some funds are leaving China for the dollar as investors
turn risk-averse,” said Patrick Cheng, a foreign-exchange
analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong Kong.
“Slower growth in China and worsening European debt problems
are going to exacerbate capital outflows in  emerging markets .”  The yuan dropped 0.04 percent to close at 6.3885 per dollar
in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency fell as much as 0.17 percent to 6.3967
earlier, the weakest level since Sept. 29. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, climbed 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to
1.5 percent. That’s the biggest one-day increase since May 31.  The Chinese central bank lowered the yuan’s  reference rate 
by 0.14 percent to 6.3429 per dollar. Nigeria’s foreign reserves
held in the yuan rose fivefold in the first quarter to the
equivalent of $503.5 million from the previous three months, the
Abuja-based central bank said yesterday.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.05 percent
to 6.3905 per dollar. It traded at 6.3953 earlier, the lowest
since Dec. 16. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards weakened
0.08 percent to 6.4350 per dollar, a 0.72 percent discount to
the spot rate in Shanghai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In a bid to defend its position as the global hub for
international trade and finance in the Chinese currency, Hong
Hong today allowed non-residents to purchase an unlimited amount
of yuan. While conversion at the offshore rate will start Aug.
1, buyers will need to seek permission to send the currency into
China, Hong Kong Monetary Authority Deputy Chief Executive Eddie
Yue said at a conference in the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
