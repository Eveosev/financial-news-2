Boeing Co. (BA)  rose the most in about a
month after boosting its forecast for the second time this year
amid increasing deliveries of commercial and military jets.  Second-quarter profit of $1.27 a share topped the $1.13
average of estimates from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg,
marking the 20th time in the seven years since Jim McNerney
became chief executive officer that Boeing beat projections.  Sales jumped 21 percent to $20 billion after the planemaker
delivered 150 airliners in the quarter, up from 118 a year
earlier. Boeing has been cutting jobs at its defense unit while
hiring for its commercial jet division, which is boosting output
more than 60 percent in four years through 2014.  “A performance like this had generally been expected for
Boeing Commercial Airplanes, given the lack of known issues on
the aircraft programs this quarter,” wrote Robert Stallard, an
analyst with  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “Where Boeing has
arguably beaten is on defense though, where expectations have
been understandably low.”  Boeing rose 2.8 percent to $74.03 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest advance since June 29. That brought the shares to a
0.9 percent gain for the year.  The defense unit overcame “a difficult market
environment” to lift sales 6.6 percent to $8.19 billion, aided
by  Saudi Arabia ’s purchase of F-15 fighter jets, Chicago-based
Boeing said. Segment profit declined 6.3 percent to $748 million
because of an inventory charge on the A160 Hummingbird
helicopter drone and lower earnings in the United Launch
Alliance space joint venture with  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)   Commercial Jets  Sales at the commercial-jet unit surged 34 percent to $11.8
billion as Boeing delivered more of its most profitable planes,
the 777 and 737. Airlines pay about 40 percent of the price upon
delivery. Profit jumped 32 percent to $1.21 billion, helped by
lower research and development costs as work wound down on the
new 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 jumbo jet.  Boeing’s net income rose 2.8 percent to $967 million.  McNerney raised Boeing’s full-year profit  forecast  to $4.40
to $4.60 a share, 25 cents higher than his April prediction.
That’s still lower than $5.34 a share in 2011, amid pressure
from rising pension costs, falling U.S. defense spending and
smaller margins on two new models.  Boeing said it still expects to deliver 70 to 85 of the new
wide-body 787s and 747-8s in 2012, split about evenly between
the models, even after reaching only about a third of that goal
so far. Both were years late in entering service after struggles
with redesigns and new materials and production processes.  787 Fixes  Boeing is still working on 56 787s that rolled off the
assembly line incomplete or before the plane was certified and
need fixes, Chief Financial Officer  Greg Smith  said on a
conference call with analysts.  About two-thirds of this year’s deliveries will come from
that batch and the rest will be fresh from the factory, he
repeated. There has been “significant improvement” recently in
the condition of newly built 787s, he said.  Boeing is on track to assemble 10 of the composite-plastic
787s a month by the end of 2013, McNerney said on the call. The
company is addressing problems building the aft fuselage at a
plant in  South Carolina , which McNerney referred to as a “hot
spot,” as well as a couple of other areas in the supply chain.  “I don’t think it’s a show stopper in terms of getting to
rate, but it is something we’re focused on,” he said.  Jet deliveries will rise to 585 to 600 this year, Boeing
repeated. That may help the U.S. planemaker reclaim the top spot
in commercial production lost to European rival Airbus SAS in
2003. Boeing raised its sales forecast by $1.5 billion, to a
range of $79.5 billion to $81.5 billion.  Commercial Backlog  The commercial backlog declined to about 4,000 jets valued
at $302 billion at the end of June, from $308 billion in March,
after Boeing booked just 28 orders in the period.  The company announced 228 orders at the Farnborough air
show outside  London  earlier this month, more than four times as
many as Airbus, which had dominated last year’s exhibition in
Paris.  The new 737 Max model that Boeing plans for 2017 is driving
orders this year, and lower introductory pricing -- as well as
pressure on prices for the current version of the single-aisle
plane -- is included in the forecast, Smith said.  Boeing is converting hundreds of commitments for the plane
into firm orders faster than planned, McNerney said. Out of more
than 1,200 orders and commitments for the plane since its
introduction late last year, 649 have been signed, he said.  Fewer Orders  Boeing will book fewer orders in 2013 after this year’s
“massive” introductory drive on the 737 Max, McNerney said,
adding that he sees sales returning to “a steady state rather
than a deep trough.”  The company will decide later this year whether to move
forward with a larger Dreamliner, the 787-10, which looks like
it will be “the absolute perfect next step,” McNerney said.  The backlog is stable amid a “fragile” economy, the CEO
said. Half or more of the planes are being ordered to replace
older fuel guzzlers, he said, so airlines see the new aircraft
as “a quick payback investment.”  Boeing’s operating cash flow rose 4.7 percent to $1.67
billion, before pension contributions, and the company had $10.3
billion in cash and marketable securities. Smith said Boeing may
start buying back shares again next year.  McNerney said the planemaker plans to keep making “small
tactical” acquisitions for its defense business amid a weak
market. The  U.S. Congress  is considering a so-called
sequestration process that could trigger even deeper reductions
in defense programs, hurting military contractors.  “The big major deal is one that would not be done without
a great deal of thought, and it’s really not on our radar screen
despite the pending storm clouds,” he said. “We’ve got a
pretty strong business here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
