Human rights conditions in China are
worsening, with the repression of lawyers, journalists and
bloggers increasing, Assistant Secretary of State  Michael Posner 
said today.  “The overall human rights situation in China continues to
deteriorate,” said Posner, who oversees democracy, human rights
and labor issues for the State Department, after the 17th U.S.-
China Human Rights Dialogue.  Posner said U.S. officials raised the fact that more than
40 Tibetans have died setting themselves of fire to protest
China’s policies toward  Tibet  and its culture.  Posner also said that the U.S. raised the arrest and
detention of the nephew of  Chen Guangcheng , the blind activist
whose flight to the U.S. embassy in Beijing roiled  U.S.-China
relations  in April.  China briefed the U.S. on the nation’s efforts to improve
legislation and judicial justice, including changes to the
Criminal Procedure Law, and on the development of grassroots
elections, the official Xinhua News Agency said.  China called for the U.S. to respect its “sovereignty and
territorial integrity, existing political and legal systems, and
self-chosen development path” and take an “unbiased look” at
China’s human rights situation, Xinhua reported.  Both sides are willing to continue their talks about human
rights, Xinhua said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
