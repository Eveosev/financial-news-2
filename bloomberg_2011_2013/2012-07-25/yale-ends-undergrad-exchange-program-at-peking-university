Yale University  said it’s canceling
an undergraduate-exchange partnership with Beijing’s Peking
University after the program attracted too few participants.  The undergraduate exchange had suffered from low enrollment
since its inception in 2006 and just four Yale students enrolled
for fall 2012, Yale said today in an e-mailed statement.  “It is disappointing to all of us that after six years we
could not attract a critical mass for this outstanding
program,”  Jane Edwards , Yale’s dean of international and
professional experience, said in today’s statement. The students
who had signed up for the coming semester will either return to
campus or pursue another program overseas.  The program was the only one where undergraduate students
from a foreign university were allowed to live with  Peking
University  students rather than in an international dormitory,
according to a Yale  statement  in December.  In 2009, a  review committee  found that while students spent
the same number of in-class hours studying Chinese at Peking
University as they would have back at campus in  New Haven ,
 Connecticut , the classes were less rigorous and left them behind
their stateside peers.  “This can create problems for students who wish, upon
their return to New Haven, to continue their study of the
language,” the report found.  The  Yale Daily News , which reported the cancellation this
morning prior to the afternoon statement, suggested cost may
have played a role in the decision, citing a faculty member’s e-
mail that called the program “extremely expensive” for Yale.  Yale will continue other partnerships with Peking
University, including a  joint center  for plant genetics and
faculty collaborations, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
