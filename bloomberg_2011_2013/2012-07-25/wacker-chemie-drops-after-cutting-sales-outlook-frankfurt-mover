Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , a German maker of
polysilicon, tumbled to a three-year low in  Frankfurt  after
reducing its 2012 sales forecast amid solar industry stagnation.  Wacker retreated as much as 4.4 percent to 49.80 euros, the
lowest intraday price since March 12, 2009. The Munich-based
company cut its outlook to “slightly below” 4.9 billion euros
($5.9 billion) from about 5 billion euros, citing potential
contract losses or delays from solar customers.  Polysilicon makers such as Wacker and  GCL-Poly Energy
Holdings Ltd. (3800)  raised output in 2011, producing more than needed
by solar-panel developers and creating a glut that sent prices
below output costs for most manufacturers. Global panel demand
is set to fall this year, a Bloomberg survey showed in March.  Wacker reported a 58 percent slump in second-quarter net
income today, citing a “substantial reduction” in polysilicon
prices. Some solar clients may not take their full contracted
delivery of the material, or may delay or end contracts amid
growing inventories and tight funding, it said in a statement.  A decline in panel demand this year would be the first
since  Germany  kickstarted the modern solar industry in 2004 with
a program of incentives. Solar-cell and panel makers including
 Q-Cells SE (QCE) , once the biggest cell maker, have filed for
bankruptcy in the past year amid lower-cost Chinese competition
and growing stockpiles.  Wacker traded at 50.28 euros as of 11:01 a.m. Frankfurt
time, extending its decline this year to 19 percent.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization totaled 241 million euros in the second quarter,
beating the 229.4 million-euro average estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
