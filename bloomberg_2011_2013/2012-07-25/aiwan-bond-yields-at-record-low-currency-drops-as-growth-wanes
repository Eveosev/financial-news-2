The yield on  Taiwan ’s  10-year bonds 
dropped to a record low and the local dollar fell to the weakest
level in more than six months on concern the island’s economic
growth is stalling.  The government may report on July 31 that gross domestic
product rose 0.5 percent in the second quarter from a year
earlier, following a 0.4 percent increase in the previous three
months, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. GDP grew 4 percent in 2011. Factory
output declined 2.44 percent last month, following a 0.21
percent drop in May, official data showed on July 23.  “Both local and global economic situations are favoring
bonds,” said  James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta Securities Co.
in Taipei. “There’s not much chance for people to lose money
buying bonds.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due March 2022 dropped
one basis point to 1.13 percent, the lowest level since at least
March 2002, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight money-market rate  was little changed at 0.387
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre. It fell 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, this month.  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.3 percent to NT$30.206 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc., after
touching NT$30.23 earlier, the weakest level since Jan. 9. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, climbed 54 basis points to 4.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
