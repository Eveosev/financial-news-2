FMC Technologies Inc. (FTI) , the third-
largest U.S. maker of oilfield equipment, rose the most in 11
months after the profit margin increased on its underwater
equipment.  FMC, based in Houston, rose 4.1 percent to $41.92 at 10:54
a.m. in  New York . The shares earlier rose 6.8 percent, the most
intraday since August 23, 2011.  The company will have $4 billion to $5 billion in subsea-
related orders this year as the market for underwater drilling
equipment strengthens, FMC Chief Executive Officer John Gremp
said on an earnings call today. The profit margin on the
company’s subsea sales increased to 11.6 percent, higher than
the 10 percent estimate of Stephen Gengaro, an analyst with
Stern Agee & Leach Inc., according to his note to clients
yesterday.  “People were worried about subsea margins and FMC
performed well,” Gengaro wrote in an e-mail today. He has a
neutral rating on FMC and doesn’t own any shares.  National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV)  and  Cameron International
Corp. (CAM) , both based in Houston, are the largest U.S. makers of
oilfield equipment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
