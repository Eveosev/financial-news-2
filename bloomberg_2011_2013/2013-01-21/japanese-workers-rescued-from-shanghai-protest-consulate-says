A group of Japanese citizens were
rescued from a  Shanghai  factory owned by Shinmei Electric Co. on
Jan. 19 after protesting workers confined them to the buildings
a day earlier.  The Japanese consulate in Shanghai had requested assistance
from the municipality’s foreign affairs office and public
security bureau in securing the safety of citizens after they
were informed of the incident, the consulate said today. The
employees were freed in the evening of Jan. 19.  About 10 Japanese employees were among those confined in
the buildings during the protests, which started in the morning
of Jan. 18, the Mainichi newspaper reported today. The workers,
which numbered about 1,000, were demonstrating against an
increase in fines for being late, according to the newspaper.  The Shanghai consulate said it didn’t have details on
whether anyone was injured in the protests and whether the
company had reached any agreements with the workers.  A dispute between China and Japan over the sovereignty of
islands in the East China Sea has damaged the $340 billion trade
relationship between the two nations and fueled concern over an
escalation in tension. Protests in September forced some
Japanese companies including  Fast Retailing Co.’s (9983)  Uniqlo to
temporarily close stores and hurt operations at others including
Toyota Motor Corp. and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
