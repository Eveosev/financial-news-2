China , the world’s fastest growing
air-travel market, released an aviation and aerospace
development plan that includes efforts to bolster the role of
local airports and promote domestically-manufactured planes.  Authorities will seek to transform airports in the cities
of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou into international hubs,
according to a State Council plan posted today to the Civil
Aviation Administration of China’s website. They’ll also
encourage the development and use of Chinese-made regional jets
and general aviation aircraft and accelerate reform of how the
country’s airspace is managed, it said.  A more than 90-fold surge in China’s economy in the past
two decades has fueled demand for flights. The State Council’s
plan is based on guidelines released in July last year that were
the first China has issued for the domestic aviation industry.
Chinese carriers will need 5,260 new planes worth $670 billion
through 2031, according to  Boeing Co. (BA)  forecasts.  “The government is sending a clear message that aviation
is very important,” said Li Lei, a Beijing-based analyst at
China Minzu Securities Co. “But the current problems such as
airspace restrictions or airport slot limits won’t change
overnight.”  China will also promote localization of the aircraft,
engine and equipment industries and encourage the development of
a green, low-carbon aviation industry, according to the plan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
