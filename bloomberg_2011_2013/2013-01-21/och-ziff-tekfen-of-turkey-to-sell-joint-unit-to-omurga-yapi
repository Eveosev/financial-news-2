Och-Ziff Capital Management Group
LLC (OZM) , the hedge fund run by Daniel Och, and its Turkish partner
 Tekfen Holding AS (TKFEN) , a construction company, applied to the
country’s antitrust regulator to sell their real estate unit.  Sculptor Turkish Real Estate, a special-purpose vehicle
owned by Och-Ziff and Istanbul-based Tekfen Holding, will sell
the joint venture, called Tekfen OZ Gayrimenkul Gelistirme AS,
to Omurga Yapi Yatirimlari AS, a Turkish real estate company,
according to a  filing  with the Ankara-based regulator.  Och-Ziff holds 83 percent in the joint venture, set up in
2007, with the rest owned by Tekfen Holding, said Omer Egesel,
chief executive of Tekfen Holding’s real estate unit Tekfen
Emlak, in a telephone interview.  “The two partners agreed to sell the joint venture after
deciding to terminate investing in new projects,” Egesel said.  Tekfen OZ built and sold several office projects in
Istanbul as well as residences in  Turkey ’s resort town of
Bodrum, Egesel said. The sale is expected to close soon, he
said, declining to give details on the deal’s size.  To contact the reporter on this story:
