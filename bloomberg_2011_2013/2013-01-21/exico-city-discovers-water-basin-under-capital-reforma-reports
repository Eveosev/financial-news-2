Mexico City discovered a water basin
more than a mile underground that’s large enough to supply the
nation’s capital with tap water for a century, Reforma  reported ,
citing a city official.  An exploratory well led to the discovery on the eastern
side of the city, the newspaper reported, citing Ramon Aguirre,
head of the local water system. The water basin is located
2,000 meters (6,560 feet) deep and may produce 80,000 liters
(21,100 gallons) per second, Reforma said without giving a
timelime for the site’s development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
