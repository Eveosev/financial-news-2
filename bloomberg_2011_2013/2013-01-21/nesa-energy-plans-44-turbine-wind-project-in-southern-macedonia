NeSa Energy, a Turkish renewable-
energy company, agreed to build a 130 million-euro ($173
million) wind farm in southern Macedonia.  NeSa plans to install 44 turbines under the accord, signed
as a letter of intent with the municipality of Bogdanci on Jan.
17, a statement on the townâ€™s website shows. A final agreement
is subject to verification of wind speeds and other conditions.  Macedonia, formerly a part of  Yugoslavia , has a target to
get about 21 percent of its energy from renewable sources by
2020 as it seeks inclusion in the European Union. The Balkan
nation applied for EU membership in March 2004 and has been a
candidate since 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
