BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, France’s biggest
bank, will spin off its  renewable energy  fund in the wake of
increased regulation.  The managers of the 437 million-euro ($581 million) fund,
which will be renamed as  Glennmont Partners , agreed to acquire
the London-based fund manager once regulators approve the deal.
BNP Paribas will remain an investor and provide support through
a distribution agreement, Glennmont said today in a statement.
Terms weren’t disclosed.  “The new structure will allow for more agile decision-
making in the rapidly-growing alternative energy sector, as well
as an increased alignment between managers’ and investors’
interests,” Joost Bergsma, the fund’s chief executive officer,
said by phone. The spinoff follows similar deals in which large
banks have retreated from private equity units as regulation
increases, he said.  The fund has invested more than 1 billion euros in 12 clean
energy assets since 2007. It has interests in projects across
 Europe  with more than 300 megawatts in capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
