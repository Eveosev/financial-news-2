Mexico’s unemployment rate fell to
its lowest since December 2008, bolstering expectations that the
central bank will keep its benchmark  interest rate  on hold.  The jobless rate dropped to 4.47 percent in December from
5.12 percent in November, the national statistics agency said
today, lower than all 13 economist estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  The central bank said a cut in the record low 4.5 percent
interest rate is possible if annual inflation continues to ease
as economic growth slows, according to policy makers’ Jan. 18
statement. While indicators such as industrial production and
exports are showing signs of moderating, the unemployment figure
gives the central bank “another argument” to keep rates steady
this year,  said Gabriel Lozano, chief Mexico economist at
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “We have a balance of indicators,” Lozano said in a
telephone interview from  Mexico  City. Unemployment “is another
reason the bank shouldn’t move rates in the future.”  The economy will expand about 3.5 percent this year,
compared with 3.8 percent in 2012, according to analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
