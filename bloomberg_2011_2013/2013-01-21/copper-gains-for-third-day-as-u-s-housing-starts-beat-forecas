Copper rose for a third day as
improving U.S. economic data fueled expectations that demand
from the second-largest user will improve this year.  Metal for delivery in three months climbed as much as 0.3
percent to $8,085.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and traded at $8,067 at 11:02 a.m. in  Shanghai . Copper advanced
to a one-week high of $8,130 on Jan. 18.  Housing starts in the U.S. climbed 12.1 percent last month
to a 954,000 annual rate, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey of economists, according to Commerce Department data on
Jan. 17. A Labor Department report showed fewer Americans
applied for jobless benefits.  “Data from the U.S. on Friday fueled positive expectations
about its economic outlook,” said Wei Hongjie, an analyst at
Beite Futures Co. “We’ll probably see the global macro-economy
stabilize this year, supporting metals.”  Futures for delivery in March on the Comex in  New York  fell
0.2 percent to $3.6735 per pound. Net-long positions, or wagers
on rising prices, held by funds fell to 16,168 futures and
options contracts as of Jan. 15 from 20,165 a week earlier,
according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Copper for delivery in April fell 0.2 percent to 58,270
 yuan  ($9,365) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. On the LME,
aluminum and nickel advanced, while zinc and lead were little
changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
