Malaysia’s ringgit fell for the
first time in three days before a report due this week that
economists predict will show consumer prices rose for the first
time since August 2011.  Inflation accelerated to 1.4 percent in December from 1.3
percent in November, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey before official data due on Jan. 23. The
Southeast Asian nation’s central bank will keep policy rate on
hold at 3 percent on Jan. 31, this year’s first meeting, a
separate poll shows.  “Expectation of a potential turnaround in inflation could
have a slight negative impact given that policy rates are likely
to be on hold,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist
at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “The Malaysian currency
should trade within a tight range today in the absence of major
market-moving news.”  The ringgit was at 3.0140 per dollar as of 9:29 a.m. in
Kuala Lumpur, compared with Jan. 18’s close of 3.0130, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.0115, near
the 3.0068 level reached last week, which was the strongest
since March 8. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, advanced 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 5.18 percent.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the
3.418 percent notes due August 2022 held at 3.47 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
