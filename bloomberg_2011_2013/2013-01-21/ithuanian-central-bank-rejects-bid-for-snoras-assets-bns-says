Bankas AB, the bankrupt lender’s administrator said, according
to the  Baltic News Service .  A contract with an investor to buy the Finasta Group, which
controls an investment bank, and Snoras’s leasing unit was
terminated, administrator Neil Cooper said, according to BNS.
Talks are continuing with other interested parties, he said, the
newswire reported. Unnamed officials at the central bank told
