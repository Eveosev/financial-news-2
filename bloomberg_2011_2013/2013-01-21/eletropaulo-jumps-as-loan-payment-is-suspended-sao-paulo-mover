Eletropaulo Metropolitana SA jumped
the most in three weeks after the Brazilian electric utility of
 AES Corp. (AES)  said it won a court order suspending payment on a loan
worth almost half the company’s market value pending an appeal.  Shares rose 4.7 percent to 15.29 reais at 1:26 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo  after earlier advancing as much as 5 percent in the
biggest intraday gain since Jan. 2. The benchmark Bovespa index
slid 0.1 percent.  Eletropaulo, based in Sao Paulo, had been ordered in
December by a Brazilian court to pay as much as 1.3 billion
reais ($640 million) on a loan taken out in 1986 from state-
controlled utility  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , known as
Eletrobras. Eletropaulo said today it won suspension of the
payment while a superior court examines the company’s appeal.  “The amount would have a very big impact on the company,”
 Pedro Galdi , the chief strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage
SLW Corretora, said in a phone interview. “But it’s just a
preliminary decision. Anything can happen.”  Eletropaulo has a market capitalization of 3.1 billion
reais after the stock tumbled 61 percent last year amid a push
by President Dilma Rousseff to cut power rates.  Eletrobras, based in  Rio de Janeiro ,  rose  3.3 percent to
12.63 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
