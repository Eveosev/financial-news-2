The Philippine peso and 10-year
bonds declined on speculation the central bank will unveil more
measures to manage capital flows after imposing limits on
currency forward positions last year.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is studying expanding  reserve
requirements  on banks’ trust products as it seeks to avert asset
bubbles, Assistant Governor Cyd Amador said on Jan. 18 after
markets closed. Overseas investment in stocks and bonds reached
$18.5 billion in 2012, the  most in 10 years , and 12 percent
higher than a year earlier, BSP reported on Jan. 17.  “The central bank appears not to be done with the measures
yet,” said Raul Tan, head of the balance-sheet segment at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp.’s Treasury Group in  Manila .  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 40.638 per dollar as of 10:55
a.m. in Manila, snapping a two-day gain, according to prices
from Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
held at 4 percent.  The yield on the 6.375 percent government notes due January
2022 rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 4.375
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  Rapid capital inflows that spurred peso gains may stoke
inflation, Governor Amando Tetangco said on Jan. 15, a day after
the exchange rate climbed to 40.550 per dollar, the highest
level since March 2008. The currency has strengthened 0.9
percent so far this year, adding to a 6.8 percent advance in
2012 that was the biggest since 2007.  Currency Controls  The  Philippines  joined  South Korea  last month in clamping
down on currency-forward positions, imposing ceilings on non-
deliverable contracts at 20 percent of capital for local lenders
and 100 percent for foreign entities. At the start of 2012, it
ordered banks to provide more funds to cover risks on those
hedges, and in July banned foreign investors from special-
deposit accounts to limit inflows.  Banks already provide reserves for some trust products such
as common trusts and unit investment trust funds, Amador said.
Philippine lenders currently set aside 18 centavos for every
peso deposited, or an 18 percent  reserve ratio .  BSP will keep its  overnight borrowing rate  at a record low
3.5 percent on Jan. 24, according to all 19 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. It cut the rate four times last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
