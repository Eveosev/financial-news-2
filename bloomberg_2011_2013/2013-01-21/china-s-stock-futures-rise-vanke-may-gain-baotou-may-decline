Chinese  stocks  rose to the highest
level in more than seven months as gains by China Vanke Co. and
industrial companies overshadowed declines among consumer staple
and technology shares.  Vanke, China’s biggest developer, surged 10 percent after
saying it plans to move trading of its foreign-currency
denominated B shares to  Hong Kong . A gauge of Shenzhen  B shares 
jumped the most in more than three years. China Shipping
Container Lines Co. climbed the most since November 2010 after
saying it turned profitable last year.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519)  led
declines among consumer-staple companies.  “B shares are doing well today as investors believe there
are more companies that will soon be transferring to Hong Kong
and would benefit from the increase in liquidity,” said Cao Xuefeng, an analyst at Huaxi Securities Co. in Chengdu. “Stocks
have risen for a month-and-a-half without a major correction.
Some investors need to take profits, so we can expect more
fluctuations in the near term.”  About three stocks advanced for each one that fell in the
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which gained 0.5 percent to 2,328.22
at the close. The index has risen 19 percent since trading near
a four-year low on Dec. 3 amid signs of an economic recovery and
on speculation urban development would increase construction
demand. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) , which tracks yuan-denominated shares
in Shanghai and Shenzhen, surged 24 percent in that time.  The CSI 300 rose 0.6 percent to 2,610.90, while the  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added less than 0.1 percent in Hong
Kong. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of the most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. gained 0.7 percent on Jan. 18.  China Vanke  Average trading volumes in the Shanghai index were 13
percent higher than the 30-day average for this time of day.
Thirty-day  volatility  was at 20.5, compared with last year’s
average of 17.1.  China  Vanke (000002) ’s yuan-denominated A shares climbed 10 percent
to 11.13 yuan, while its B shares jumped 10 percent to 13.75
yuan, the highest close since December 2007. Both classes of
stock traded for the first time since Dec. 25.  China International Marine Containers Group Co. (2039)  was the
first company to leave the  B-share market  for Hong Kong, where
daily trading volume is more than 3,000 times higher, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The conversion gives Shenzhen-based
Vanke increased access to foreign investors, who need government
approval to buy A shares.  The Shenzhen B Share Index, which tracks 53 stocks, rose
4.7 percent, the biggest increase since Nov. 13, 2009.  Coal Supply  A gauge of CSI 300  industrial  companies rose 1.1 percent as
China Shipping Container jumped 9.9 percent to 2.77  yuan , the
biggest increase since Nov. 2, 2010. The company reported
preliminary 2012 net income of 520 million yuan ($84 million),
compared with the previous year’s loss of 2.74 billion yuan.  Coal stocks climbed after Beijing Business Today reported
China’s 2013 initial-term coal supply contract, signed between
producers and power companies, was 55.8 percent higher than last
year. Taiyuan Coal Gasification Co. surged 10 percent to 13.64
yuan, the most since Jan. 10, 2012. Yangquan Coal Industry Group
Co. climbed 6.9 percent to 15.28 yuan.  An index of CSI 300  information-technology  shares lost 1.4
percent, the second-worst performer of 10 industry gauges, after
it surged 7.1 percent last week. The measure trades for 18.6
times estimated profit, more than the CSI 300’s 10.8 times, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Goertek Inc. (002241) , a supplier of Apple
Inc., sank 3.8 percent to 38.19 yuan.  Higher Valuations  A measure of consumer-staples shares was the CSI 300’s
worst performing  industry , dropping 2 percent today. The gauge
trades at 12.9 times estimated profit. Kweichow Moutai, China’s
biggest liquor maker by market value, lost 3.2 percent to 197.31
yuan.  An oversupply of liquor products “may persist for some
time, leading to a decline in share prices” of producers, Huaxi
Securities’ Cao said.  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund climbed 0.8 percent in
 New York  on Jan. 18 after Chinese data showed the nation’s
economy grew faster than estimated in the fourth quarter.  China’s growth rebound may be capped by a labor-force
squeeze and shrinking resources that leave the government
satisfied with rates of expansion as low as half the  peak  during
the past decade.  A pace of 7 percent to 8 percent reflects economic forces,
 Ma Jiantang , head of the National Bureau of Statistics, said on
Jan. 18 after reporting 7.9 percent  expansion  in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier. He said a decline last year in the
working-age population was of “great importance.”  The  China  Securities Regulatory Commission said 10
applications were approved out of 175 companies that have
submitted applications for initial public offerings on the
Shanghai exchange as of Jan. 17. In Shenzhen, 32 applications
were approved out of 363 companies applying for IPOs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
