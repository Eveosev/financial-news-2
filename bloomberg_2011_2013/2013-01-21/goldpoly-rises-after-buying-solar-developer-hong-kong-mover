Goldpoly New Energy Holdings Ltd. (686) , a
Hong Kong-based solar cell maker, rose the most in more than
five years after it agreed to buy the 92.2 percent stake it
doesn’t own in power-plant developer China Merchants New Energy
Holdings Ltd. for HK$2.12 billion ($273 million).  The stock jumped as much as 44 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since Sept. 28, 2007, to HK$1.83 and traded at
HK$1.55 as of 10:37 a.m. in Hong Kong trading. The benchmark
 Hang Seng Index  rose 0.1 percent.  Goldpoly, which owns 7.8 percent of China Merchants at
present, will buy a 17.4 percent stake in the developer from
Ease Soar, a unit of  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , according to
a Jan. 18 filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange, sent after
the market closed. As part of the deal, Ease Soar will get a 13
percent stake in the solar-cell maker, making it Goldpoly’s
second-largest owner. GCL-Poly is the world’s biggest
polysilicon producer.  Goldpoly is following solar-panel producers such as  First
Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and  JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS)  in expanding into project
development, using their products, as panel prices have declined
61 percent in the past two years hurting profit.  “China Merchants only works downstream, where profit
margins for developing solar farms are quite good,”  Lian Rui,
a Beijing-based analyst at research company NPD Solarbuzz, said
by phone today. “In west China, the margin ranges from 10
percent to 15 percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
