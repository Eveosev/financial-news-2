European  naphtha  rose to the highest
in almost two weeks as BP Plc and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought
cargoes of the fuel.  Shell sold a cargo of diesel for delivery to London Thames
at a lower premium than the previous trade.  Gasoil barges  traded
at the highest in more than two months.  The volume of jet fuel shipped to Europe in January from
the  Middle East  and  Asia  is poised to decline from the highest
level in three months as demand from airlines slows.  Light Products  Vitol Group sold two naphtha cargoes at $929 and $930 a
metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. That’s the highest
since Jan. 9 and compares with $920 and $921 on Jan. 18. Vitol
has offloaded at least 24 cargoes of the fuel this month.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, narrowed 20 cents to
$6.79 barrel as of 1:23 p.m. London time, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and refined products broker. That’s the
least since Jan. 9.  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub changed
hands from $981 to $986 a ton, according to a similar survey of
the Argus Bulletin Board and Platts. That’s up from $972 to $976
on Jan. 18, and is the highest since Jan. 10, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Trafigura Beheer BV and  BP Plc (BP/)  bought the Eurobob grade, to
which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.  Total SA (FP)  and
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  also sold barges which typically comprise 1,000 to
2,000 tons. Gunvor bought and sold.  Gasoline’s  crack  rose to $7.78 a barrel, PVM data showed.
That’s the most since Oct. 12 and compares with $7.37 in the
previous session.  Middle Distillates  BP bought the 20,000 ton diesel lot from Shell at $15 a ton
more than February gasoil, the Platts survey showed. That
compares with a Jan. 11 deal at a $20 premium for Amsterdam.  A diesel barge traded at $10 a ton more than February
gasoil on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange, the survey of Platts
showed. That’s the lowest since May 8, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, and is down from deals at $10 to $11 on
Jan. 18. Two barges traded at parity to the benchmark prices.  Vitol bought two lots from Argos Groep BV and one from BP.  Heating oil barges traded at a premium of $2 to February
gasoil, the highest since Nov. 1, the Platts survey showed.
Argos and Litasco sold to Morgan Stanley and Vitol. The low-
sulfur grade changed hands at a $6 premium, versus plus $5 on
Jan. 18.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG and  Statoil ASA (STL)  sold barges of jet
fuel to Shell and Vitol at $71 and $73 a-ton premiums to
February gasoil, the survey of Platts showed. That compares with
plus $70 on Jan. 17.  Buyers of jet fuel plan to import about 1.4 million metric
tons this month, according to the median estimate from a
Bloomberg survey of six traders and brokers who specialize in
the  aviation fuel . That’s down from 1.5 million in December,
which was a three-month high.  About 845,000 tons have so far been loaded or provisionally
booked for January, reports from three shipbrokers showed,
including Optima Shipbrokers Ltd. in  Athens .  Gasoil for February delivery rose $8, or 0.8 percent, to
$963.75 ton on ICE as of 5:07 p.m. London time.  The contract’s backwardation, or premium to March, grew
$1.25 to $8.25 a ton. This market structure can signal rising
near-term consumption or reduced supply.  Money managers’  net-long bets  on gasoil increased 9.2
percent to 62,092 in the week to Jan. 15 from 56,871 in the
previous period, the data show. That’s a fourth straight weekly
gain and is the most since Oct. 30.  Gasoil’s  crack  widened to $16.72 versus $16.46 on Jan. 18.
Brent shrank 0.3 percent to $111.51 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  changed hands from $612 to $612.50 a
ton, the survey of Platts showed. That compares with $609 to
$611.25 in the previous session. The  low-sulfur  grade traded at
$639 a ton, versus $635.50 on Jan. 18.  Tenders  Sonatrach, the Algerian state-run oil producer, issued a
tender to buy 300,000 tons of gasoline for delivery in February
and March, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The tender is for the purchase of 10 cargoes at 30,000 tons
each, according to the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information is confidential. The tender will
probably be awarded this week, one of the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
