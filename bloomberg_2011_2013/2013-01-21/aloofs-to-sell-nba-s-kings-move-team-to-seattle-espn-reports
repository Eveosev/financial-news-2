The Maloof family agreed to sell a
65 percent interest in the  National Basketball Association ’s
Sacramento Kings to a Seattle-based group led by Microsoft Chief
Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer  and hedge-fund manager Chris
Hansen,  ESPN reported .  The deal, which still needs league approval, values the
team at $525 million, according to the Walt Disney Co. unit,
which cited unidentified people in the league. The 65 percent is
composed of a 53 percent stake owned by the Maloof family and a
12 percent stake owned by minority owner Bob Hernreich, ESPN
reported.  Joe Maloof, president of the family’s Maloof Cos., didn’t
immediately respond to a text message seeking comment on the
report. Tim Frank, a spokesman for the NBA, didn’t immediately
reply to an e-mail seeking similar comment.  The Maloof family will retain a small part of the team with
no decision-making power once the agreement is completed, ESPN
said. The league expects the new owners to apply to relocate the
team to Seattle for the 2013-2014 season by the March 1
deadline.  Sacramento Mayor  Kevin Johnson , a former NBA point guard,
posted a message on his Twitter account this morning that read:
“Let me be clear. Though agreement btw Maloofs & Seattle is
out, deal is NOT done. Sac can still present an offer 2 NBA.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
