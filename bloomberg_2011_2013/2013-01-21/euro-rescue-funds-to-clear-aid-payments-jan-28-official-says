The euro area’s rescue funds will
probably clear aid payments to Greece,  Spain  and  Portugal  during
a Jan. 28 conference call, a euro-area official said.  The European Stability Mechanism and the European Financial
Stability Facility must convene their boards of directors as the
final step in disbursing funds after the payments get political
approval. Euro-area finance ministers today may allow the
payments to proceed after an earlier round of staff-level
signoffs.  Greece is due to receive a payment of 9.2 billion euros
($12.3 billion), including 2 billion euros in aid for its
government and 7.2 billion euros for its banking sector, the
official said on condition of anonymity because the information
isn’t public.  Spain is on track to receive a disbursement of about 1.8
billion euros for its banks that will be transferred in the
first days of February, the official said. Portugal stands to
receive an 800 million-euro disbursement from its aid program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
