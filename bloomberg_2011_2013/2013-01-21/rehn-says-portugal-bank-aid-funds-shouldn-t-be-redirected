Portugal’s banks need the 12 billion
euros ($16 billion) that were set aside as backup funding and
the government shouldn’t use the money to assist other
industries, European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  said.  “At the current stage, it is not advisable to rededicate
the money” as “this could entail serious risks to the
stability of the financial system,” Rehn said in a Jan. 17
 written answer  to a question from a member of the European
Parliament. He said the funds were allocated as part of a
broader Portuguese bailout from European authorities and the
 International Monetary Fund  to help the country’s lenders
bolster their capital if they lose access to markets.  “The amount of 12 billion euros has been carefully chosen
so as to provide sufficient insurance against financial risks
whilst avoiding significant amounts of money being unused,”
Rehn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
