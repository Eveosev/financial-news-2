Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-largest airline, dropped to its lowest level in
five weeks after the company’s commercial director disappointed
investors by deciding not to renew his contract.  The stock declined 1.8 percent to 10.75 shillings by 1:25
p.m. in Nairobi, the biggest decline since Jan. 11 and the
lowest level on a closing basis since Dec. 17. About 67,500
shares have traded so far, equivalent to about 39 percent of the
three-month daily average volume.  Commercial Director Mohan Chandra, 60, will leave the
company after agreeing not to renew his contract, Communications
Manager Chris Karanja said today in response to e-mailed
questions. He did not say when Chandra would leave.  Chandra’s resignation “was generally negative on the stock
and is causing concern among investors,” Eric Musau, a research
analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank, said by
telephone today.  Kenya Airways plunged 42 percent last year, making it the
Nairobi Securities Exchange’s worst performer. It has retreated
5.7 percent so far this year, the third-worst performer, while
the bourse has risen 10 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In the six months through September, Kenya Airways reported
a loss of 4.79 billion shillings ($55.2 million) compared with a
profit of 2.03 billion shillings a year earlier, the company
said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
