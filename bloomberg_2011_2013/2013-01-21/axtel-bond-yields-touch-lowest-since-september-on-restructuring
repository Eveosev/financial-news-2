Shares and bonds of Axtel SAB,
 Mexico ’s second-largest landline telephone carrier, rallied
after the company said a majority of creditors accepted its
debt-restructuring offer last week.  Axtel shares jumped 7.5 percent to 3.59 pesos at 1:30 p.m.
in Mexico City trading, after earlier today reaching 3.65 pesos,
the highest intraday price since Oct. 25. Yields on Axtel dollar
bonds maturing in 2017 declined 44 basis points, or 0.44
percentage point, to 19.94 percent, headed for the lowest
closing level since Sept. 17.  The company’s bondholders accepted a combination of senior
secured debt, peso-denominated convertible bonds and cash to
replace securities due in 2017 and 2019, Axtel said in a
statement after markets closed on Jan. 18. The company is in the
process of selling tower assets to  American Tower Corp. (AMT)  for $250
million in a transaction contingent upon the success of the debt
exchange.  “This is very positive for Axtel, without a doubt,”
Andres Medina-Mora, a Sao Paulo-based analyst with Corporativo
GBM SAB, said in a telephone interview today. “This also makes
the sale of the towers possible, and that’s significant.”  Axtel, based in San Pedro Garza Garcia, unveiled a new swap
on Jan. 14 that improved the terms of its $765 million debt
restructuring after 40 percent of creditors rejected the initial
offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
