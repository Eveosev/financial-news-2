Argentina  competing with  Asia  for
cargoes of liquefied natural gas may curb shipping demand by
shortening voyages, according to RS Platou Markets AS.  Low hydropower in  South America  helped LNG prices there
rise to $17.50 per million British thermal units, driving prices
in northeast Asia to $19.10, Frode Moerkedal, an Oslo-based
analyst at Platou, said in an e-mailed report today, citing
figures from Argus Media. That could reduce shipping demand
because Argentina is 4,600 nautical miles from Nigeria, compared
with a 10,700-mile journey to  Japan , according to the report.  Argentina is seeking to import 5.2 million tons of the
frozen fuel this year, up from 3.6 million in 2012, according to
the investment-banking unit of Norway’s largest shipbroker. If
the increase replaces cargoes to Japan, shipping demand would
fall 1 percent, cutting rates by $8,000 a day, all else being
equal, Platou estimates.  “The reason for the higher spot prices has partly been
fierce competition from other regions,” Moerkedal said in the
report. “The increased trade within the Atlantic basin may
hamper the charter rate development.”  Spot rates for modern LNG carriers increased to $110,000 a
day, from $100,000 in December, Moerkedal said in the report,
citing brokers he didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
