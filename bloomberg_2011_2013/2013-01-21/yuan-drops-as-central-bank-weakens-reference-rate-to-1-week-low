The  yuan  dropped after the People’s
Bank of  China  set the currency’s daily fixing at the lowest
level in more than a week and before policy makers meet in
Europe and Japan.  The PBOC lowered the  reference rate  by 0.06 percent to
6.2790 per dollar. European finance ministers will meet in
Brussels today for discussions on how and when the 500 billion-
euro ($666 billion) European Stability Mechanism can provide
direct help to banks. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  will conclude its two-
day policy meeting tomorrow. The yuan has gained 0.18 percent
against the dollar so far this year, after a 1 percent
appreciation in 2012.  “A strong currency isn’t favorable to export growth so
further gains will be limited in near term,” said Patrick Cheng, foreign-exchange analyst at Haitong International
Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “There’s a bit of cautious
sentiment before meetings in Europe and  Japan .”  The yuan slipped 0.06 percent to 6.2190 per dollar as of
10:11 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The spot is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent
on either side of the fixing. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, was steady at 1.4 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Average daily yuan transactions in Hong Kong doubled to at
least $6 billion in the past year, according to Standard
Chartered Plc estimates, giving investors more confidence to
invest in the currency using options, forwards and Dim Sum
bonds.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.05 percent
to 6.1925 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Twelve-
month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.02 percent to 6.2782, a
1 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
