The U.S. must be “responsible” on
the issue of an island dispute between  China  and Japan, and must
be “discreet in words and speech” to win the Chinese people’s
trust, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said today.  Hong spoke after another Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin
Gang, criticized U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  for
saying the U.S. opposes any effort to disrupt Japan’s
administration over the islands. The islands are China’s
inherent territory and “no one can deny this,” Hong said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
