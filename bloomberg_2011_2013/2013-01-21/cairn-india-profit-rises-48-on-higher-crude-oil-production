Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , operator of the
nation’s biggest oilfield on land, reported 48 percent higher
profit in the third quarter after it increased production.  Net income  at Cairn  India  and its units rose to 33.4
billion rupees ($623 million), or 16.5 rupees a share, in the
three months ended Dec. 31, the Gurgaon-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. That beat the 30.7-billion rupee median
 estimate  of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Total revenue
rose 38 percent to 42.8 billion rupees.  Cairn India, acquired by  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  for $8.67
billion in 2011, this month won approval to raise production
from its biggest field in the western Indian state of Rajasthan
by 71 percent, helping boost earnings. The explorer sells crude
at rates linked to Brent oil prices, unlike state-owned  Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , which is required to bear part of the
country’s fuel subsidy.  Cairn India  shares  rose 1 percent to 340.30 rupees at the
close in Mumbai before the earnings announcement, valuing the
company at $12 billion. The stock has gained 6.6 percent this
year, outperforming a 3.5 percent increase in the benchmark
 Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   The explorer’s share of production from fields in India was
128,058 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the quarter ended
Dec. 31, 29 percent higher than a year earlier and 1 percent
lower than in the preceding quarter, the company said in the
statement. Net production from the Rajasthan field averaged
118,984 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the three months,
compared with 87,585 barrels a day a year earlier and 120,261
barrels a day a quarter earlier.  Rajasthan Output  The company sold its oil and gas at an average $94.90 a
barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter, 4 percent lower than a
year earlier, according to today’s statement. The average price
of Brent traded in London rose 1 percent to $110.13 a barrel in
the quarter from a year earlier.  The oil ministry approved an increase in Cairn India’s
Rajasthan output to 300,000 barrels a day from the current
175,000, Oil Minister Veerappa Moily said Jan. 4. Cairn India
owns 70 percent stake in the Rajasthan oil block and state-run
Oil & Natural Gas owns the rest.  Vedanta Resources, a London-based miner controlled by
billionaire  Anil Agarwal , and unit  Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA)  completed
buying a 59 percent  stake  in Cairn India from Cairn Energy Plc
and other shareholders in December 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
