In a  recent ad campaign  on the Internet,  Texas  Attorney General Greg Abbott hits on two of Texans' favorite things: the Second Amendment and making fun of  New Yorkers . Abbott targeted ads at Manhattan and Albany ZIP codes last week encouraging  New York  gun owners to move to Texas. His ads began appearing one day after New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo  signed into law a package of state gun-control measures. The ads, which were featured on news websites, promoted Texas's gun culture and low taxes. "Wanted: law abiding New York gun owners looking for lower taxes and greater opportunity," one read. The other asked: "Is Gov. Cuomo looking to take your guns?" The ads initiated a  heated discussion  on Abbott's Facebook page. The page gained more than 20,000 Facebook fans from Jan. 11 to Jan. 17.  Reading through the comments, it's pretty clear that New Yorkers weren't the main target here; Texans were. Abbott  writes : Texas has created more than 275,000 jobs in the last year alone! And we’ll fight like hell to protect your rights. You’ll also get to keep more of what you earn and use some of that extra money to buy more ammo. The ads were purchased by Abbott's political campaign, Texans for  Greg Abbott . With an extra 20,000 names on his Facebook subscriber list, they've probably already aided his  reported  run for governor in 2014. (Kirsten Salyer is social media editor for Bloomberg View.
