President  Hugo Chavez , who has been
recovering from cancer surgery in Cuba, is expected to return to
Venezuela in the coming days, the  Associated Press  reported,
citing his brother Argenis Chavez.  While Chavez continues to recover, the final decision about
whether he’s well enough to return home rests with his doctors,
Argenis, who is also president of the state-run electricity
holding company Corporacion Electrica Nacional SA, told the AP.  A spokeswoman at his office, who asked not to be identified
because of company policy, said Argenis Chavez wasn’t
immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
