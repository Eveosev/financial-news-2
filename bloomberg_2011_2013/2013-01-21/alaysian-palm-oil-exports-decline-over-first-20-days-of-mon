Palm oil  shipments from  Malaysia 
fell 17 percent in the first 20 days of this month, according to
Intertek, with the pace of decline slowing as buyers adjust to
new rules in China and taxes in India, the biggest consumers.  Exports fell to 830,830 metric tons from 1 million tons in
the same period in December, Intertek said today. That compares
with a 25 percent drop in the first 10-day period of this month
and a 21 percent fall over 15 days. An estimate of the 20-day
exports from Societe Generale de Surveillance is due later today.  India will impose a tax of 2.5 percent on crude palm and
soybean oil imports, the  Agriculture Ministry  said on Jan. 17.
China’s quality watchdog, the General Administration of Quality
Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, toughened inspections on
imports from Jan. 1 to improve  food safety . Malaysia, the
largest producer after  Indonesia , dropped its export tax to zero
for this month to combat  record stockpiles  that have hurt prices.  “We’re still looking to see how the impact will be from
the China side, on their new rules on imports, as well as
India’s new import tax,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip
Futures Pte Ltd. in Singapore, said by phone. “A lot depends on
what’s going on in India and China.”  Palm oil for April delivery rose as much as 1.2 percent to
2,428 ringgit ($804) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange,
and was at 2,426 ringgit at 11:38 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur . While
futures gained 1.4 percent last week, the first such advance in
three weeks, they’ve declined 23 percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
