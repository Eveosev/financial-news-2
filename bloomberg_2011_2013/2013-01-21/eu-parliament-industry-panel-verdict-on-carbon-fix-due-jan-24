The European Parliament’s industry
committee is scheduled on Jan. 24 to give its view about a plan
to curb oversupply of carbon permits, according to an agenda of
its meeting.  In a non-binding opinion the committee is due to decide
whether to support a change to the European Union emissions
trading law to enable delaying auctions of some allowances. Its
opinion has an advisory role in the legislative process.  Francisco Sosa Wagner, a Spanish member of 27-nation
parliament in charge of the draft measure in the industry
committee, recommended endorsing the proposal in a draft opinion
in November.  The assembly’s environment committee is due to vote on it
next month. The amendment to the EU carbon trading law will
eventually need the backing of the full legislature in a vote
that could take place in March at the earliest as well as
support from the bloc’s national governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
