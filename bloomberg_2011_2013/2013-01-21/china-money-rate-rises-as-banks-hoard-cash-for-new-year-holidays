China ’s money-market rate rose for a
second day on speculation cash supply will wane as banks hoard
funds to prepare for the Lunar New Year holidays.  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for seven and 14-
day reverse-repurchase agreements, or contracts that are used to
add funds to the financial system, according to a trader
required to bid at the sales. The central bank said on Jan. 18
it will start short-term money operations to help regulate cash
supply to supplement regular open-market auctions each Tuesday
and Thursday. It named 12 lenders to participate.  “Banks wouldn’t lend to each other because they are afraid
of volatilities in liquidity,” said Song Qiuhong, a bond
analyst at Foshan Shunde Rural Commercial Bank Co. in Foshan, a
city in the southern province of Guangdong.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 16 basis points to 3 percent as of
10:25 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average compiled
by the National Interbank Funding Center. China’s financial
markets will be shut from Feb. 11 to Feb. 15 for the holidays.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, rose one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.18 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
