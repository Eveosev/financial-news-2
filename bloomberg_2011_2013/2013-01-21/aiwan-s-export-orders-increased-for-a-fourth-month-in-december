Taiwan ’s export orders climbed for a
fourth month in December, signaling the economy’s recovery is
gaining traction amid stronger demand from the U.S. and China.  Orders, an indicator of shipments in the next one to three
months, rose 8.5 percent from a year earlier after an 11.1
percent gain reported earlier for November, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs said in Taipei today. The median of 13
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was 10 percent.  The export-dependent economy is showing signs of rebounding
as growth in China, its largest trading partner, accelerated for
the first time in two years last quarter and retail sales in the
U.S. gained more than forecast in December. Overseas shipments
from the island rose more than economists expected last month.  “Taiwan will benefit from the recovery of  China  and the
U.S. consumer market,” Raymond Yeung, a Hong Kong-based senior
economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said
before the report. “The electronics industry remains very
resilient,” he said, adding that European demand has stabilized.  Orders from China rose 2.4 percent in December from a year
earlier, while those from the U.S. climbed 10 percent and  Europe 
gained 25.1 percent. Electronics advanced 3.8 percent, and
information and communication products rose 18.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
