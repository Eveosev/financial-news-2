Most Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
city’s benchmark index trading near a 19-month high, as  China 
Shipping Container Lines Co. gained after saying it will return
to profit, while  ZTE Corp. (000063)  fell.  China Shipping climbed 3.9 percent. China Vanke Property
(Overseas) Ltd. surged as much as 19 percent after its parent

Leung, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager who helps oversee
about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. “This is a
consolidation after a sharp rally. A lot of people want to lock
in profit.”  Hong Kong’s benchmark index closed on Jan. 18 at the
highest level since June 2011 after a report showed China’s
economic growth accelerated for the first time in two years.

The company may swing to a profit in the first three months of
