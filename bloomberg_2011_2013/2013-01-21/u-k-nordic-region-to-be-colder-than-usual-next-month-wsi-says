  The U.K. and the Nordic region
will be colder than usual in February while most of the European
mainland will be warmer than normal, forecaster  WSI Corp.  said.  “The very volatile European winter continues, with a
recent transition back to a colder regime after a brief thaw
during the first half of January,”  Todd Crawford , chief
meteorologist at Andover, Massachusetts-based WSI, said today in
an e-mailed statement. “Going forward, all of the objective
evidence suggests a very cold remainder of winter across the
 Nordic region .”  The southern European mainland will be wet and windy next
month, according to WSI, which has more than 200 energy clients
in the U.S. and  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
