The Pittsburgh Penguins spoiled the
New York Rangers’ first home game of the National Hockey League
season, winning 6-3 behind two goals by James Neal.  Evgeni Malkin added three assists yesterday at Madison
Square Garden as the Penguins improved to 2-0 and dropped the
Rangers to 0-2 this lockout-delayed season.  Tyler Kennedy, Matt Niskanen,  Pascal Dupuis  and Kris Letang
also scored goals for Pittsburgh, which started the season with
a 3-1 victory against the Philadelphia Flyers.  Rick Nash scored his first goal for the Rangers, who also
got goals from Taylor Pyatt and Ryan Callahan. New York
goaltender  Henrik Lundqvist  allowed four goals on 18 shots
before being replaced by Martin Biron.  To contact the reporter on this story:
