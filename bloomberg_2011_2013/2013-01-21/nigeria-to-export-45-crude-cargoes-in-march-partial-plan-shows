Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, is scheduled to export 45 crude cargoes in March,
partial loading programs obtained by Bloomberg show.  Daily exports in March are scheduled to be 1.36 million
barrels, according to the plans, which exclude 10 grades. Total
shipments for next month are planned at 2.16 million barrels a
day, the full schedule for February showed.  The country will ship 12 consignments of its benchmark Qua
Iboe grade in March, two more than a revised schedule for next
month, according to the program. The total includes three lots
that were deferred from February. Exports of Bonny Light blend
will fall by two to five cargoes.  Nigeria will export eight cargoes of Forcados, five each of
Akpo and Bonga, three lots of Amenam and Usan and two each of EA
Blend and Yoho, the plans showed.  The schedules for Abo, Agbami, Antan, Brass River, Erha,
Escravos, Okono, Okwori, Oso and Pennington were not yet
available. Those grades totaled at least 23 cargoes in February.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
