Beach Energy Ltd. (BPT) , an explorer
developing shale gas resources in central  Australia , slumped the
most in seven months in Sydney trading after results at one of
its wells disappointed some investors.  Beach fell as much as 8.9 percent to A$1.325, the biggest
drop since June 4, while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index
decreased as much as 0.2 percent. The shares were 7.2 percent
lower at A$1.35 as of 12:03 p.m. local time.  The energy producer, whose operations include 20 oilfields
and six gas discoveries in the Cooper Basin, recorded a peak
rate of 2.6 million standard cubic feet per day at its Moonta-1
gas well, the Adelaide-based company said Jan. 18. Beach is
among explorers in the  Cooper Basin , an area straddling the
border of  South Australia  and Queensland states, seeking to
benefit from rising prices and demand driven by projects on the
east coast to ship liquefied natural gas to Asia.  Although Beach’s flow rate is the highest it has achieved,
“it is likely to fall short of expectations,” according to a
Jan. 18 note from Macquarie Group Ltd. Expectations were as high
as 4 million standard cubic feet per day, said Macquarie, which
forecasts Beach shares will rise to  A$1.70 in 12 months .  “While we expect some weakness on the back of this result,
it does confirm that Beach can deliver meaningful flow rates
from this previously untested interval,” Macquarie said.  Beach,  Santos Ltd. (STO)  and  Senex Energy Ltd. (SXY)  are among oil and
gas producers developing shale prospects in Australia, which has
almost 400 trillion cubic feet of estimated shale gas reserves
that may be recoverable, according to a 2011 report from the
U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Beach has fallen 8.8 percent this year, valuing the company
at A$1.71 billion ($1.79 billion), compared with a 2.5 percent
gain in Australia’s benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
