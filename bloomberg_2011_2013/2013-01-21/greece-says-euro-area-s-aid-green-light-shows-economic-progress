Greek Finance Minister Yannis
Stournaras said the euro-area blessing of this month’s aid
disbursement for  Greece  is proof of the government’s
“important” progress in overhauling the economy while
signaling challenges ahead for further payouts.  “Greece satisfied the milestones that had been set for
January,” Stournaras told reporters late yesterday in Brussels
after a meeting of the finance chiefs of the 17-nation euro
area. “The road is long and continues.”  The finance ministers gave the green light for the payout
of 9.2 billion euros ($12.3 billion) to Greece this month. Of
the funds, 7.2 billion euros in bonds are for the further
recapitalization of Greek banks and 2 billion euros in cash are
to cover the government’s budget needs.  The disbursement is part of a 49.1 billion-euro tranche
that the euro area approved last month for Greece through March
after revamping the nation’s second rescue. Policy makers gave
the Samaras government two extra years until 2016 to meet
budget-cutting targets.  Europe  split the whole tranche into sub-
installments over four months to allow more oversight of
Greece’s progress in curbing expenditure and overhauling the
recession-hit economy.  Greece received 34.3 billion euros last month, including
funds for banks. After the January disbursement, the country is
due to get about 5.6 billion euros for budget obligations in two
separate payments in February and March. The  International
Monetary Fund  is contributing a separate amount to Greece of
about 3 billion euros this quarter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
