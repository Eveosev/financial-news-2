A 30-year-old Turkish man linked to
the Kurdish militant group PKK was charged today in the Jan. 10
killings in Paris of three women leaders of the organization.  He was charged with murders linked to terrorism and
involvement in a terrorist ring, and is being held in jail while
investigators search for motives and to determine whether he
acted alone, according to French prosecutors.  The man, who lives in  France  and acted as a driver for one
of the women, “could be the author, or one of the authors, of
the crime,” Paris public prosecutor  Francois Molins  said today.
A second suspect was released without charge.  The victims included Sakine Cansiz, one of five people who
founded the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, in 1978.  The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by U.S. and
the European Union, has been fighting for autonomy of the
Kurdish-dominated southeast of  Turkey  since 1984. The conflict
has left 40,000 dead. Turkey has been talking to imprisoned PKK
chief Abdullah Ocalan to seek an end to the fighting.  The women were all shot multiple times in the head with the
same gun in the group’s Paris office between midnight and about
2 a.m., Molins said. Gunshot residue was found in the suspect’s
bag, though a partial print found on a cartridge didn’t match
his, the prosecutor said.  The driver had already been questioned and was arrested
after discrepancies arose between his statement and evidence
from surveillance video and other witnesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
