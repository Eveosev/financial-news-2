Eastern  Europe ’s economic-growth
prospects are improving because of the  European Central Bank ’s
efforts to resolve the continent’s debt crisis, the  European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development  said.  The 29 eastern European and central Asian countries where
the EBRD invests will expand 3 percent this year after estimated
growth of 2.6 percent in 2012, the London-based bank said today
in an e-mailed statement, revising October forecasts of 3.1
percent and 2.7 percent. The region’s gross domestic product
rose 5 percent in 2011.  “Signs of stabilization in the euro zone are reducing the
risks facing emerging Europe, leading to cautious optimism that
the worst of the transition region’s problems may slowly be
drawing to a close,” the bank said in the statement. “The
deceleration is showing signs of bottoming out.”  Eastern Europe has suffered as tighter capital rules forced
western European banks with units in the region to cut funding
and sell assets. Trade with neighbors in the continent’s west
has also fallen as the euro area grapples with a recession.  While the pullback by western lenders has continued, the
pace is now “much slower,” while the decline in exports
moderated toward the end of last year and “modest private
capital inflows” have returned, the EBRD said.  Egypt , Morocco, Jordan and  Tunisia , where the bank is
starting to lend as part of an expansion, will grow 4 percent
this year compared with 2.9 percent in 2012, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
