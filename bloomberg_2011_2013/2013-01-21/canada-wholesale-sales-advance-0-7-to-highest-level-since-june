Canadian wholesale sales climbed for
a second month in November, rising to the most since June, led
by computer and telecommunication equipment.  Sales advanced 0.7 percent in November to C$49.6 billion
($49.9 billion) after a revised 0.8 percent gain in October,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg projected a 0.5 percent gain, the median of 16
forecasts.  The report adds to some signs of strength in the worldâ€™s
11th largest economy after a weak third quarter with growth at a
0.6 percent annualized pace. Other reports published this month
have shown greater-than-forecast increases in employment and
factory sales.  Five of the seven major categories tracked by the agency
rose in November, Statistics Canada said, led by motor vehicles
and machinery and equipment. Wholesalers of motor vehicles and
parts recorded a 1.5 percent rise in sales, while machinery and
equipment wholesalers posted a 1.8 percent gain. Computer and
communications suppliers registered a 6.3 percent gain.  The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the impact of
price changes, increased 0.5 percent.  Receipts have stagnated after reaching a record C$50
billion in May. Wholesale sales were 3.2 percent higher in
November than the same month a year earlier.  Wholesale inventories fell 0.4 percent to C$61.2 billion in
November. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how many
months it would take to deplete stocks at the current sales
pace, fell to 1.24 in November from 1.25 in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
