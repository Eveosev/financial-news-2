Taliban insurgents attacked the
headquarters of a police traffic department in Kabul early
today, the second attack involving  suicide bombers  in the
heavily guarded capital in less than a week.  One of the attackers used a rocket-launcher to blast open
the building’s gates, allowing other militants armed with
suicide vests and other weapons to enter the compound, General
Mohammad Zahir, chief of the capital’s police investigation
unit, said by phone.  As many as seven Afghan civilians and four traffic police
personnel have been wounded so far, and part of the headquarters
is on fire, Zahir said. The Taliban claimed the attack in an e-
mail from spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed.  The strike follows a Jan. 16 Taliban raid on  Afghanistan ’s
intelligence agency in Kabul that killed one civilian and
injured at least 30 others.  To contact the reporter on this story:
