The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark bonds
due 2020 fell the most in a week, narrowing the gap with the
country’s bonds due 2015 from the widest level in two years.  The yield on the bonds due in 2020 fell five basis points
to 3.69 percent today. The yield differential, or spread,
between the 2020 bonds and the notes due in 2015 narrowed to 156
basis points, or 1.56 percentage points. That spread reached 164
basis points on Jan. 18, the widest since July 2010.  The gap between the two bonds widened last week as
international investors poured into shorter-dated Peruvian bonds
on bets the sol was undervalued. The currency posted its first
weekly decline since November as the central bank bought $970
million in the foreign-exchange market, stepping up efforts to
restrain the sol’s appreciation.  The weakness in the sol “was an opportunity to come in and
take positions,” said Alberto Jabiles, a fixed-income trader at
Banco Continental SA in  Lima . “The only way to do that is
buying bonds, and to avoid the rate volatility it’s better to
buy short bonds. So the spread to the 2020 got very wide and
that made the 2020 attractive.”  The sol was little changed today at 2.5535 per U.S dollar,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  International investors account for more than half of
Peru’s government bond market, according to  November data  from
the  Finance Ministry .  Peruvian bonds are attractive because of “appealing
yields, low currency volatility and strong economic
fundamentals,” Credit Suisse AG strategist Daniel Chodos in  New
York  wrote today in an e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
