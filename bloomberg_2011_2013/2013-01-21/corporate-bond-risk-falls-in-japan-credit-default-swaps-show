The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  from non-payment dropped to a 17-month low, according
to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined two basis points to
136 basis points as of 9:21 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. The measure is set for its lowest close since
August 2011, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 106.5 basis points
as of 8:44 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge has ranged from 102.8 to 110.1 this year,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx  Australia  was also little changed at
114.5 as of 10:39 a.m. in Sydney, according to Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices. The benchmark has ranged from
111.6 to 127.5 this year, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
