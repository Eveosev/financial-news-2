Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-
largest bank by assets, said Andrew Tinney stepped down as chief
operating officer of its wealth-management unit.  “Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins  acknowledged
clearly last week in a letter to all 140,000 colleagues in
Barclays that transformation of the bank’s culture is
imperative,” the London-based company said in a statement
today. “Independent reports like the one commissioned in early
2012 for Barclays Wealth in America are intended to identify
areas where change is required and to recommend remedial
steps.”  Tinney couldn’t be reached for comment at the bank or
through directory assistance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
