Santam Ltd. (TKG) , South Africa’s largest
property and casualty insurer, declined for a third day after
Fitch Ratings said the nation’s insurers may struggle to
maintain profits and as heavy rains added to potential claims.  Santam (SNT)  fell as much as 6.4 percent to 174.06 rand and
closed 2.6 percent lower at 181 rand in Johannesburg trading.
The shares have slid 4.7 percent since Jan. 16.  South African insurers “may struggle to maintain the same
level of profitability” in a tougher operating environment,
Fitch said last week. Tourists were evacuated and camps were
closed at the Kruger National Park following heavy rains this
weekend, SANParks said in an e-mailed statement today. Santam’s
net underwriting margin was below its medium-term target range
of 5 percent to 7 percent after “adverse weather conditions”
in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng provinces and “extensive
fires” in St Francis Bay in the Eastern Cape, the company said
on Dec. 20.  “That’s pretty much where most of their claims are going
to come from; floods in the Eastern Cape and the fire in St
Francis Bay toward the end of last year,” Byran Taljaard, a
Johannesburg-based analyst at Avior Research Pty Ltd. said by
phone. “I’m expecting a lot of claims to come through. I don’t
expect these next results for 2012 to be very good.”  The insurer is scheduled to report final results for 2012
on Feb. 27. First-half net income increased 83 percent to 578
million rand ($65 million), the company said Sept. 1.  Santam’s 30-day historical  volatility , a measure of stock
swings, increased to 23.88 from 23.04 the previous trading day.
The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s 30-day volatility gauge
was at 8.19 from 8.05 previously. A higher reading means an
asset price can have bigger moves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
