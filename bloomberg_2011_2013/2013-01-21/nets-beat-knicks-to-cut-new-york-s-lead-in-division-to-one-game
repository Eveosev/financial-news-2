Joe Johnson scored 25 points as the
Brooklyn Nets evened their season series with the  New York 
Knicks in an 88-85 win at Madison Square Garden.  Johnson hit a 16-foot jump shot with 22.3 seconds remaining
to give the Nets an 85-84 advantage last night. Deron Williams
then made three of four foul shots as the Nets (25-16) moved to
within a game of the Knicks (25-14) for the Eastern Conference’s
Atlantic Division lead.  The Nets took a 47-41 lead into halftime before the Knicks
rallied with 10 straight third-quarter points, taking a 68-65
advantage heading into the final period.  “When they made a run we were still able to bounce back,”
Johnson, who went 5-of-8 from 3-point range, said in a televised
interview after the game. “Last time we were in here, they made
a run on us and we never recovered.”  The teams are tied 2-2 since the Nets moved to Brooklyn
from Newark, New Jersey, at the beginning of the National
Basketball Association season.  Carmelo Anthony, who scored a game-high 29 points and had
seven assists to lead the Knicks, shot an air ball from the
baseline with under 10 seconds remaining and Williams hit two
free throws -- his 51st and 52nd in a row -- to give the Nets an
87-84 lead with 8.3 seconds on the clock.  Jason Kidd then was intentionally fouled, making one of two
free throws, and Williams again was sent to the line, missing
his first attempt and sinking the second. A last-second shot by
the Knicks’ J.R. Smith that would have sent the game to overtime
bounced off the backboard and rim.  Nets Turnovers  The Knicks’ turned the ball over five times, compared with
19 for the Nets, who entered the game having won eight of their
past nine contests. It was the first game for the Knicks since
they beat the Detroit Pistons 102-87 in London on Jan. 17.  The New Orleans Hornets beat the Sacramento Kings 114-105,
led by 27 points from forward Ryan Anderson off the bench. The
NBA announced yesterday that the Kings were sold, pending
approval of the league’s team owners, to a group that would move
the franchise to Seattle.  Elsewhere yesterday it was Chicago 95, the Los Angeles
Lakers 83; San Antonio 90, Philadelphia 85; Golden State 106,
