MMG Ltd. (1208) , the publicly traded unit
of  China ’s biggest metals trader, has put on hold shipping of
zinc concentrate from the world’s second-biggest zinc mine
because of bad weather in Australia’s Queensland state.  MMG has also restricted zinc processing at its Century
mine, located about 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the port of
Karumba, Melbourne-based spokeswoman Kathleen Kawecki said by
phone. A tropical low with gusts of up to 85 kilometers an hour
will most likely cross the coast between Aurukun and Kowanyama
tonight, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said today on its
website.  Century has a production capacity of 500,000 metric tons
annually, making it the world’s second-biggest zinc mine.
Cyclone season in  Australia  lasts from November to April and can
disrupt iron ore operations in Australia’s north-west. Cyclones
also form over the nation’s north-east, where zinc, copper and
coal mines are located.  MMG’s state-owned parent, China Minmetals Corp., trades
non-ferrous metals as well as bulk commodities iron ore and
coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
