U.K. natural gas for next-day
delivery declined for a second day as system flows exceeded
demand amid colder than average weather.  Day-ahead gas  dropped as much as 2.2 percent, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Flows in the 24 hours to 6
a.m. tomorrow were predicted at 393 million cubic meters a day
compared with demand of 376 million,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data
show. The low temperature in  London  was minus 1 degree Celsius
(30 Fahrenheit) versus a 10-year average of 4 degrees,
CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg show.  Gas for tomorrow fell 1.25 pence or 1.8 percent, to 68.25
pence a therm at 8:29 a.m. London time.  Next-month gas  slid 1.6
percent to 66 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.49 per
million British thermal units and compares with $3.60 per
million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Flows from  Norway , the U.K.’s biggest source of imported
gas, were as low as 85 million cubic meters a day, the least
since Jan. 9, Gassco AS data show.  Electricity for tomorrow dropped 1.8 percent to 52.35
pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
