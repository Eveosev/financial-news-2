The following is the text
of  Canada ’s wholesale trade report for November from
 Statistics Canada .  Wholesale sales rose 0.7% in November to $49.6 billion. The
increase was largely a result of higher sales in the computer
and communications equipment and supplies industry.  In volume terms, wholesale sales were up 0.5%.  Computer and communications equipment and supplies post the
largest gain  In November, five of the seven subsectors, accounting for
about two-thirds of wholesale sales, reported increases.  The largest advance in dollar terms was in the machinery,
equipment and supplies subsector, which grew by 1.8%. This
result was primarily because of higher sales in the computer and
communications equipment and supplies industry, which rose 6.3%.
This coincided with a sharp gain in imports of communications
and audio and video equipment, which were 14.2% higher in
November than in October, according to international merchandise
trade data.  The motor vehicle and parts subsector recorded its second
consecutive increase. Sales were up 1.5% as a result of an
advance in the motor vehicle industry (+1.7%), which was
responsible for about 90% of the subsector’s growth.  Sales in the building material and supplies subsector
increased by 0.7% in November, on the strength of higher sales
in the lumber, millwork, hardware and other building supplies
industry.  Declines were observed in the personal and household goods
subsector (-0.6%) and the food, beverage and tobacco subsector
(-0.4%).  Sales growth concentrated almost entirely in Ontario  In November, most of the national increase came from
Ontario, where wholesalers reported the largest gain since July
2011. Wholesale sales were up in three provinces in November:
Ontario, Manitoba and  Alberta .  Ontario posted a 2.1% increase in sales, its first advance
in three months. Wholesalers in the province benefited from
higher sales in the computer and communications equipment and
supplies industry and the motor vehicle industry.  In Manitoba, sales grew 4.9% in November, after falling
1.5% in October. It was the province’s third increase in four
months.  Sales were up 0.8% in Alberta, its second straight gain.
Several industries contributed to the November result, notably
the computer and communications equipment and supplies industry.  Quebec  (-1.4%) posted the largest decline in dollar terms
in November.  Inventories down  Wholesalers’ inventories fell 0.4% in November to $61.2
billion, the second decrease in three months. Inventories were
down in 16 of the 25 industries.  The largest inventory declines in dollar terms were in the
construction, forestry, mining and industrial machinery,
equipment and supplies industry (-1.9%) and the motor vehicle
industry (-2.4%).  The inventory-to-sales ratio fell from 1.25 in October to
1.24 in November.  The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time in
months required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain
at their current level.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
