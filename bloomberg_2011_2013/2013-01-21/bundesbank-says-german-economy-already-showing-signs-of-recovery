The Bundesbank said the German
 economy ,  Europe ’s largest, has started to show signs of recovery
after a probable contraction in the final quarter of last year.  “The largely stable labor market and a better outlook for
output suggest that the economic weakness won’t last all that
long,” the Frankfurt-based central bank said in its monthly
report today. A recovery “is already appearing in the first
quarter of 2013,” it said.  German gross domestic product may have dropped as much as
0.5 percent in the fourth quarter from the third, according to a
Jan. 15 preliminary estimate by the Federal Statistics Office,
as weaker demand from the euro area and slower global growth
damped exports and investment. The Bundesbank lowered its growth
outlook on Dec. 7 after the euro area fell into recession, and
now predicts the German economy will expand 0.4 percent this
year and 1.9 percent in 2014.  “At the turn of the year, however, the outlook has
brightened,” the Bundesbank said today. “Companies’
expectations have noticeably improved, particularly the
estimation of export opportunities.”  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  this month
hailed “positive contagion” in financial markets after the
announcement of the ECB’s bond-buying program eased concerns
about the sovereign debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
