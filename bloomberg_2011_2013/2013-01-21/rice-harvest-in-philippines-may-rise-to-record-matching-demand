Rice production in the  Philippines ,
once the world’s largest importer, may climb to a record this
year, matching demand, as the government expands irrigation to
boost yields, according to the Department of Agriculture.  Rough-rice output may expand to 20 million metric tons (13
million tons in  milled  equivalent), from 18.03 million tons in
2012, Agriculture Assistant Secretary Salvador Salacup said at a
media briefing in Manila today. This year’s harvest would be
enough to meet  consumption , Assistant Secretary Dante Delima
said in an interview from Manila.  The government also aims to boost corn output to at least 8
million tons, surpassing the record 7.41 million tons in 2012,
Salacup said. The country may export its excess corn to  Malaysia 
and  South Korea , Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala told
reporters in Manila today, without providing a volume.  To contact the reporters on this story:
