Finland’s economy will expand at a
slower rate than previously forecast, according to OP-Pohjola
Group, a Finnish banking and insurance co-operative.  Gross domestic product will grow 0.8 percent this year and
1.7 percent in 2014 after an average 0.2 percent expansion in
2012, the Helsinki-based group said in a report today. It had
forecast growth of 1.4 percent for 2013 on Aug. 27.  Exports are recovering “slightly” and domestic spending
is crimped by weak expectations, tax increases and stagnating
real income, OP-Pohjola said. Finland’s economy is in recession
after shrinking on two consecutive quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
