Sims Metal Management Ltd. (SGM) , the
world’s largest scrap metal recycler, tumbled the most in more
than five months after an internal investigation revealed
potential fraud at two of its U.K. businesses.  The  stock  fell as much as 6.6 percent to A$9.32 in Sydney
trading, its biggest drop since Aug. 15. It declined 4.6 percent
to A$9.52 at 12:42 p.m. The benchmark index was little changed.  The carrying value of inventory at its units at Long
Marston and Newport may be overstated by about A$60 million ($63
million), New York-based Sims said today in a statement. The
company said it has set up a special investigation committee,
which will work with external auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
and legal counsel Baker & McKenzie LLP.  “The preliminary findings indicate the situation has
arisen in the context of control failures and potential
fraudulent conduct by local and regional plant management
responsible for technology and downstream processing systems in
the U.K.,” Sims said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
