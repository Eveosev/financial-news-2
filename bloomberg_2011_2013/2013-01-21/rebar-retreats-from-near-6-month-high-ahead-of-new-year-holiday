Steel reinforcement-bar futures
retreated from near the highest level in six months as
construction activity in  China  slows ahead of a week-long
holiday.  Rebar for May delivery fell as much as 0.8 percent to 3,971
 yuan  ($638) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange and
was at 3,992 yuan at 10:59 a.m. local time. The contract reached
4,047 yuan on Jan. 7, the highest since July 10.  “Construction activity will slow gradually as China is
approaching the most-important Lunar New Year holiday, which
will reduce demand,” Ren Xinlei, an analyst at Luzheng Futures
Co., said in a report today.  China, which produces almost half of the world’s steel,
boosted output by 3.1 percent last year as economic expansion
spurred demand for roads and railways. Steel production
increased to 716.5 million tons in 2012 and rose 7.7 percent in
December from a year earlier to 57.66 million tons, the National
Bureau of Statistics said on Jan. 18.  The government will spend 650 billion yuan this year on
railway construction, more than the 631 billion yuan spent last
year, Xinhua News Agency reported on Jan. 17, citing Minister of
Railways Sheng Guangzu.  The average spot  price  of rebar was little changed at 3,730
yuan a ton on Jan. 18, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port
dropped 0.2 percent to $145.10 a dry ton on Jan. 18, according
to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
