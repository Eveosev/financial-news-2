The Baltimore Ravens scored 21
unanswered points to defeat the  New England Patriots  and advance
to the  Super Bowl , where they’ll play the  San Francisco 49ers .  The Ravens won the American Football Conference title game
28-13 in Foxboro, Massachusetts, to reach the National Football
League championship contest for the second time. The 49ers
staged the biggest comeback in National Football Conference
championship game history to beat the Atlanta Falcons 28-24,
also on the road.  “We fought all game long, it wasn’t easy by any means,”
49ers linebacker Patrick Willis, who had 12 tackles, said in a
televised interview. “The past two years, all we’ve done is
play as a team.”  The results mean the Super Bowl -- which is scheduled for
Feb. 3 in  New Orleans  -- for the first time will be contested by
teams coached by brothers.  Jim Harbaugh , 49, leads San Francisco
and John, who is 13 months older, is in charge of the Ravens.  New England topped Baltimore 23-20 last year in the
conference championship game, making today’s contest the first
time in 25 years that the same teams played for the AFC title in
consecutive seasons. The last to do so were the  Denver Broncos 
and  Cleveland Browns  after the 1986 and 1987 seasons.  Lewis Continues  The first defeat in five AFC title games at home for New
England extended the 17-year career of linebacker  Ray Lewis , who
told his Ravens teammates that he would retire when the playoffs
ended.  “Last year, when we walked out of here, I told them we’d
be back,” Lewis said after receiving the championship trophy.
“I said, ‘Don’t hold your head down because we’ve got something
to finish.’ This is our time.”  Baltimore won its only previous visit to the Super Bowl,
after the 2000 season, while San Francisco last reached the
title game after the 1994 season. The 49ers have never been
beaten in five trips to the Super Bowl and will seek to tie the
Pittsburgh Steelers’ NFL-best six titles.  New England’s  Stephen Gostkowski  kicked a 31-yard field
goal at Gillette Stadium for the only score of the first
quarter.  Ray Rice  gave Baltimore a 7-3 lead as he switched
directions and dodged two tacklers to score on a 2-yard run,
before  Tom Brady  found  Wes Welker  with a 1-yard touchdown pass
and Gostkowski added a field goal from 25 yards to make it 13-7
to the Patriots at halftime.  Baltimore, a 7 1/2-point underdog, took the lead for good
at 14-13 in the third quarter when  Joe Flacco  found Dennis Pitta
with a 5-yard touchdown throw and extended the advantage to
eight points when Anquan Boldin hauled in a 3-yard pass from
Flacco at the start of the fourth quarter.  21-0 Run  Baltimore made it three touchdowns without reply to
complete the scoring when Flacco and Boldin again hooked up on
an 11-yard play.  Brady threw an interception with 6:49 to play and another
with 1:06 remaining to end his team’s chances.  The 49ers rallied from a 17-0 deficit at the start of the
second quarter. The previous biggest comeback to win in the NFC
title game was by the Falcons, who recovered from a 13-point
deficit to beat the Minnesota Vikings 30-27 on Jan. 17, 1999.  The win at Atlanta’s Georgia Dome was San Francisco’s first
in six road playoff games going back to 1989, and only the third
the team has won away from home in the postseason.  Falcons’ Lead  The Falcons led 17-0 one play into the second quarter as
Julio Jones hauled in touchdown passes of 46 yards and 20 yards
from quarterback  Matt Ryan  either side of a 35-yard field goal
by Matt Bryant.  San Francisco made it a three-point game as LaMichael James
drove through the Atlanta defense on a 15-yard scoring run and
 Vernon Davis  caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback
Colin Kaepernick with two minutes to play in the first half.  Ryan then capped a seven-play, 85-yard drive with a 10-yard
pass to Tony Gonzalez 25 seconds before halftime to push
Atlanta’s lead to 24-14. Gonzalez, 36, is sixth on the NFL
career list with 103 regular-season touchdown receptions.  The 49ers made it three touchdowns in as many possessions
when  Frank Gore  rounded out the opening drive of the second half
with a 5-yard scoring run.  Trailing 24-21, San Francisco then missed two opportunities
to score.  First,  David Akers , who missed a league-high 13 field-goal
attempts during the regular season, failed from 38 yards as his
kick struck the top of the left upright and caromed wide.  The 49ers got the ball back when Ryan fumbled a snap on the
next drive. Kaepernick drove his team to Atlanta’s 5-yard line
before  Michael Crabtree  fumbled as he was tackled at the 1 at
the start of the fourth quarter.  After Atlanta punted, San Francisco went ahead for the
first time as Gore ran for his second score, from nine yards, to
make it 28-24 with 8:23 remaining.  Atlanta then drove 60 yards on 13 plays before Ryan threw
an incomplete pass on a 4th-and-4 play at San Francisco’s 10-
yard line with 1:09 remaining. The Falcons could only get one
play off after regaining possession with six seconds remaining.  Kaepernick completed 16 of 21 passes for 233 yards and one
touchdown. Ryan connected on 30 of 42 passes for 396 yards and
three touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
