The United Arab Emirates plans to
issue regulations governing the mortgage market in six to nine
months, central bank governor Sultan Bin Nasser Al-Suwaidi said.  Directives sent last month to lenders restricting mortgages
are meant to “draw their attention to certain standards that
are expected to be adopted under the new system,” he told
state-owned newspaper al-Ittihad. “The central bank is usually
cautious,” he was cited as saying.  The central bank last month notified the banks of a
decision to cap mortgages for foreigners and nationals at 50
percent and 70 percent of the property values respectively. The
new rules will be discussed with the banks before they are
adopted and should allow a higher lending cap for people who are
planning to live in the home they are buying as opposed to those
who are investing in real estate, the governor said.  “The new regulation that the central bank is preparing
will make more liquidity available for the real estate
industry,” he said. “The current system for real estate
financing in the country hasn’t been changed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
