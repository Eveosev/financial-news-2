Brazilian mobile carrier  Oi SA (OIBR4)  fell
the most in five months after Veja reported that some
shareholders are dissatisfied with CEO Francisco Valim’s
handling of the company.  Shares tumbled 5.3 percent to 8.68 reais at 1:39 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, the steepest intraday decline since Aug. 20.  Valim’s situation is “unsustainable” because some
shareholders are unhappy with the company’s results from last
year, Veja columnist Lauro Jardim reported, without saying how
he got the information. A press official at Oi declined to
comment when contacted by  Bloomberg News .  Oi’s adjusted net income fell 32 percent to 678.5 million
reais ($332 million) last year, according to a Bloomberg survey
of 13 analysts. The company is scheduled to release fourth-
quarter results next month.  Oi was the worst performer among the three publicly traded
Brazilian mobile phone operators in 2012, sinking 24 percent.
It’s up 4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
