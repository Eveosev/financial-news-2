Banif SGPS SA won temporary European
Union approval to receive 1.1 billion euros ($1.46 billion) in
aid from Portugal’s government to help it meet local  capital
requirements .  Portugal must provide a far-reaching restructuring plan for
the Funchal, Madeira-based lender by March 31 to allow EU
regulators take a final decision on whether the capital
injection meets EU rules on aid to banks, the European
Commission said in a statement today.  “Portugal urgently needs to work out an in-depth
restructuring plan, refocusing the bank on its core activities
in Madeira and the Azores and leading to a significant
downsizing of its operations,” EU Competition Commissioner
 Joaquin Almunia  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
