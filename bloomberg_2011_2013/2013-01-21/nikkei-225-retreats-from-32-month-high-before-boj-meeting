Japanese  shares  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average slipping from a 32-month high, as the
yen climbed against the dollar after hitting its lowest level in
2 1/2 years before a  Bank of Japan (8301)  policy decision tomorrow.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , which counts  North America  as its biggest
market, lost 1.5 percent. Fanuc Corp. slid 3.9 percent after the
factory robotics company’s rating was cut at Citigroup Inc.
Sharp Corp. lost 3.8 percent on a Reuters report it slowed
production of displays for Apple Inc.’s iPad. Sony Corp. gained
3.3 percent on a report the electronic makers may release the
thinnest tablet computer ever.  The Nikkei 225 lost 1.5 percent to finish at 10,747.74 in
 Tokyo  after closing at its highest since April 2010 on Jan. 18.
The Topix Index sank 0.7 percent to 905.16. The measure has
risen 25 percent since elections were announced on Nov. 14 on
optimism the new government led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
will increase pressure on  Japan ’s central bank to do more to
stimulate the economy.  “Expectations for the Bank of Japan and its easing
measures have been priced into stocks,” said  Ayako Sera , a
market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd. in Tokyo,
which oversees 33 trillion yen ($367 billion). “The speed at
which Japanese shares rose was very fast, so we’re seeing some
adjustments as the yen also corrects.”  Japan’s government is trying to shake off entrenched
deflation and drive a recovery in the world’s third-biggest
economy, with Abe pressing the central bank to double its
inflation target to 2 percent. All 23 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey expect the BOJ to expand asset purchases at a two-
day meeting that starts today, with a median estimate for a 10
trillion yen ($111 billion) increase. The Cabinet announced a
10.3 trillion yen stimulus package on Jan. 11.  Exporters Slide  Electronics and car manufacturers were among the biggest
drags on the Topix after the yen rose to 89.54 against the
dollar after touching 90.25, the weakest since June 2010.  Nissan sank 1.5 percent to 865 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, dropped 0.6 percent to 3,330 yen.  “Stocks and currency investors are keeping a very close
eye on each other,”  Sumitomo Mitsui ’s Sera said. “Investors
now want to confirm some of the expectations they have for the
Bank of Japan.”  Fanuc sank 3.9 percent to 14,350 yen, the second-biggest
 drag  on the Nikkei 225. The factory-automation maker was cut to
neutral by Citigroup, which cited potential for missed earnings
estimates and depressed Japanese demand.  Sharp dropped 3.8 percent to 331 yen, its biggest drop
since Jan. 7. The company slowed a Japanese  production line 
making screens for iPads to a minimum as Apple manages
inventory, according to a Reuters report.  JGC Falls  JGC Corp., which constructs plants globally, declined 2.7
percent to 2,562. Seven of 17 JGC employees were safe after a
four-day standoff between terrorists in  Algeria , Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. He told reporters he couldn’t
confirm media reports that nine had been killed.  Among stocks that rose, Sony gained 3.3 percent to 1,187
yen, reaching its highest since May 10. The electronics maker’s
Xperia Tablet Z may be thinnest-ever mainstream tablet to date,
website VentureBeat  reported , without citing anyone.  Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s biggest trading house by market
value, gained 0.6 percent to 1,825 yen after it offered to buy
out meat producer Yonekyu Corp. as it seeks to bolster income
from businesses outside raw materials. Yonekyu surged 20 percent
to 893 yen.  The Topix is trading at 1.07 times  book value , compared
with 2.04 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.47 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Volume on the measure was about 5 percent above its 30-day
average. The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 1
percent to 24.13, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.9
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
