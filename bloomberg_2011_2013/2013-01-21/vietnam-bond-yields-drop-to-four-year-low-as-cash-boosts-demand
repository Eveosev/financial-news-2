Vietnam ’s three-year bonds gained,
pushing the yield to a four-year low, as an increase in cash at
banks bolstered demand for debt. The dong was little changed.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  fell for a sixth day,
signaling cash in the banking system rose as lending slowed.
Credit growth may be low in the early months of the year, Prime
Minister Nguyen Tan Dung wrote in his New Year message posted on
the government’s website on Jan. 1.  “Higher trading turnover together with decreases in yields
is clear evidence of high demand for bonds,” ACB Securities
analyst Le Huynh Nhut Hai wrote in a research note today. ACB
Securities expects gains from the  bond market  in the first
quarter, according to the note.  The three-year bond yield fell seven basis points to 8.38
percent, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level since Feb. 16, 2009. The
overnight rate dropped 20 basis points to 1.8 percent.  The State Treasury sold 156 trillion dong ($7.5 billion) of
debt in 2012, a 92 percent increase from 2011, Thoi Bao Ngan
Hang newspaper reported Jan. 18, citing official data. It plans
to raise 30 trillion dong this quarter, according to the paper.  The dong traded at 20,853 per dollar as of 3:25 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,848 on Jan. 18, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set its  reference rate 
at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, 2011, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent
on either side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
