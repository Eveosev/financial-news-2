The naira appreciated as the central
bank held interest rates at a record high today and as the
regulator sold the U.S. currency at an auction.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer strengthened
less than 0.1 percent to 157.0999 a dollar as of 5:40 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital, reversing earlier declines of as
much as 0.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria’s Monetary Policy Committee,
held its policy rate at 12 percent today, Governor Lamido Sanusi
told reporters in Abuja, the nation’s capital. That was in line
with the forecast of 12 of 13 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.
The  inflation rate , which eased to 12 percent in December, is
still above the central bank’s target of below 10 percent. The
regulator sold $100 million at an auction today compared with
$108 million at the previous sale Jan. 16, it said in an e-
mailed statement.  “The naira should continue to receive support from the
current level of interest rates, while issuance plans and
offshore appetite for Nigerian debt will remain key drivers of
bond yields,”  Razia Khan , the head of African economic research
at Standard Chartered Plc in  London , said in an e-mailed note to
clients after the data release.  Nigeria’s legislature approved a 4.98 trillion-naira ($31.7
billion) budget for 2013 in December, 7 percent higher than last
year, and raised the benchmark oil price in this year’s budget
by $4 to $79 a barrel, giving more funds to the government for
spending. The budget will be based on an exchange rate of 160
naira a dollar. President Goodluck Jonathan hasn’t yet signed
the budget or rejected it.  Yields on naira debt due 2022 fell 2 basis points to 11.25
percent, according to Jan. 18 prices compiled on the  Financial
Markets Dealers Association  website. Borrowing costs on the
nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 were little
changed at 3.713 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated by 0.1 percent to 1.90801 a dollar
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
