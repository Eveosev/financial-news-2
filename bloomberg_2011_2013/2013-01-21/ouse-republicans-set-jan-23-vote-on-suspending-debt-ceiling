The Republican-led U.S. House of
Representatives  announced  it plans to vote on a bill as soon as
Jan. 23 to temporarily suspend the U.S. debt limit until May 19,
2013.  After suspending the limit for three months, the nationâ€™s
 borrowing  authority would be automatically increased from $16.4
trillion to accommodate the money the  U.S. Treasury  borrowed
during those three months. The Senate, where Democrats have a
majority, also would have to agree on the measure.  The House suspension plan is accompanied by a caveat:
Congress must pass a budget resolution for the next fiscal year
by April 15. If either the Senate or the House fails to pass a
budget resolution by that time, pay for the members of that
chamber will be withheld in an escrow account until they approve
one, or at the latest at the end of the 113th Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
