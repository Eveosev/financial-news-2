Southampton held Everton to a
goalless tie in Mauricio Pochettino’s first game as coach of the
English Premier League team.  Southampton fired Nigel Adkins after three seasons and
named Pochettino as his replacement on Jan. 18. Pochettino, 40,
left in November after four years with Spanish club Espanyol,
for which the Argentine also made more than 300 appearances in
two stints as a player.  Southampton remains in 15th place in the 20-team standings
with 23 points after the home draw. Everton stays fifth, with 38
points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
