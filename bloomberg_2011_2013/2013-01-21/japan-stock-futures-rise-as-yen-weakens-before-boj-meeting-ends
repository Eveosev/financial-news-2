     (Corrects final paragraph to show U.S. futures rose.)  Japanese stock futures rose as the
yen weakened against the dollar and investors awaited the
outcome of a two-day policy meeting by the Bank of  Japan  that
concludes today.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Canon Inc. (7751) , Japan’s largest
camera maker, gained 1.5 percent as the yen weakened against the
dollar. National Australia Bank Ltd. fell 0.6 percent in Sydney
as Banco Santander SA, Spain’s largest lender, said it isn’t in
talks to buy NAB’s U.K. assets. Advance Residence Investment, a
Japanese real-estate investment trust, may fall after saying it
will sell shares.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,795 in  Chicago  yesterday, up from 10,710 at
the close in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,800 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index (AS51)  advanced 0.2 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell
0.3 percent.  “Subdued news from the  Bank of Japan (8301)  could mute our
current rally,” said Evan Lucas, a Melbourne-based market
strategist at IG Markets Ltd., a provider of equities,
currencies and commodities trading services. “Many investors
expect no real surprise from the BOJ today.”  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average has risen in the last 10
weeks as a weaker currency boosts the earnings outlook for
exporters amid optimism the new government led by Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe will increase pressure on the central bank to do more
to stimulate the economy. The yen weakened 0.3 percent to 89.86
per dollar at 7:57 a.m. in  Tokyo . Japanese shares are currently
moving in lockstep with the currency more than at any time
during the past 24 years.  Inflation Target  The BOJ will today adopt Prime Minister Abe’s desired 2
percent inflation target, according to 21 of 23 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Ending consumer-price declines would
give companies and households more incentive to borrow, helping
the world’s third-biggest economy to pull out of a contraction.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, a benchmark regional equities
gauge, traded at 14.3 times average estimated earnings compared
with 13.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.1 times for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  International investors are the most bullish on stocks in
at least 3 1/2 years, with close to two-thirds planning to raise
their holdings of equities during the next six months, according
to a Bloomberg survey.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2
percent. U.S. markets will reopen today following a public
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
