Rubber declined after the longest
weekly winning streak since November 2007 as the Japanese yen
rebounded from its weakest level in 2 1/2 years, reducing
investor’s appetite for yen-denominated contracts.  Rubber for delivery in June fell as much as 1.6 percent, to
311.3 yen a kilogram ($3,471 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, before trading at 312.9 yen at 11:26 a.m.
local time. The price gained 3.6 percent on Jan. 18, the biggest
advance at the close since Oct. 25.  “Investors took a cue from the strengthening Japanese yen
to take profits after recent rallies in the rubber market,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, said by phone
from  Singapore .  Asian stocks fell from a 17-month high and the yen rallied
its lowest level since June 2010 as  Bank of Japan  policy makers
begin a two-day meeting. All 23 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey expect the BOJ to expand its asset purchases as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe works to end more than a decade of deflation
and stimulate the economy.  Abe’s pledges of aggressive fiscal and monetary action
triggered a 10 percent decline in  Japan ’s currency against the
dollar from mid-November through last week, as the Topix Index
capped its longest weekly winning streak since 1986. A weakening
currency aids exporters’ income.  Rubber for delivery in May dropped 0.6 percent to 25,800
 yuan  ($4,147) a ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange. Natural-
rubber inventories dropped 152 tons to 101,330 tons last week,
declining for the first time in five months, based on a survey
of nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and
Tianjin, the Shanghai Futures Exchange said Jan. 18.  Thai rubber free-on-board gained 1 percent to 98.70 baht
($3.32) a kilogram on Jan. 18, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
