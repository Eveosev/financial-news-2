India ’s benchmark bonds gained,
sending the 10-year yield toward a 30-month low, on optimism
slowing inflation will create room for the central bank to cut
 interest rates .  Eleven of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey predict
the repurchase rate will be cut by 25 basis points at a Jan. 29
review, while two forecast a 50 basis point reduction. The rate
was last lowered by half a percentage point in April. The
wholesale-price  index  rose 7.18 percent in December from a year
earlier, the least since 2009, government data showed last week.  “Investors have broadly priced in a 25 basis point cut in
the repo rate at current yield levels,” said Lakshmi Iyer,
Mumbai-based head of fixed income at Kotak Mahindra Asset
Management Co.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.86 percent as of
10:31 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate touched 7.80 percent on Jan. 14, the lowest
level for a benchmark 10-year bond since July 2010.  The government is allowing state-owned refiners to raise
prices of diesel gradually, Oil Secretary G.C. Chaturvedi said
last week. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is seeking
to cut fuel subsidies as part of a plan to narrow the budget
 deficit  to 5.3 percent of gross domestic product and avert a
sovereign rating downgrade.  “The diesel policy move is an added positive and will
enable the central bank to reduce rates,” said Iyer.  The one-year swap, a derivative contract used to guard
against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis point to
7.56 percent in Mumbai, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
