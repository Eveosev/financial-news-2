(Corrects date of embassy raid in third paragraph.)  Iranians must stay clear of actions
stemming from emotions, a spokesman for  Iran ’s Revolutionary
Guard Corps. said, condemning militants’ storming of the British
embassy in Tehran in 2011,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported.  “We shouldn’t fall into the trap of the U.S. and Zionist
regime’s plans by carrying out certain emotional undertakings,”
General Ramezan Sharif was quoted as saying by the Tehran-based
newspaper.  A group of Iranian militants raided the British Embassy’s
compound in Tehran in Nov. 2011. The attack started in the form
of protests on the first anniversary of the killing in Tehran of
a nuclear scientist, for which Iran blamed foreign intelligence
services, including those of the U.K. The raid also followed
U.K. participation with the U.S. in expanding sanctions against
Iran over the country’s nuclear program.  The attack led the U.K. to evacuate its diplomatic staff
and shut its embassy in Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
