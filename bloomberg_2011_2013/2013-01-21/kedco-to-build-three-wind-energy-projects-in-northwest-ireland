Kedco Plc (KED) , an Irish clean-energy
developer, agreed to build three wind farms in the country’s
northwest that may total 30 megawatts in capacity.  Kedco signed a co-development agreement with a private
landowner through its Reforce Energy unit, the Cork-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. It will fund pre-
construction development costs in return for a 50 percent stake
in each project, and will apply for planning consent this year.  “Ireland has one of the best wind resources in  Europe ,
making it a very attractive location for the development of
wind-energy projects,” Chief Executive Officer Gerry Madden
said in the statement. “There is the exciting prospect of a
potential export market for this renewable energy to the U.K.”  Kedco also plans to build five biomass plants in the U.K.
for 59 million pounds ($94 million) and this month signed an
agreement to build a 25-megawatt facility at Londonderry Dock in
 Northern Ireland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
