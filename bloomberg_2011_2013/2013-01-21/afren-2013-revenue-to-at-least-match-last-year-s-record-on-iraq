Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K.-based oil explorer
focused on Nigeria and  Iraq , said revenue will remain at a
record-high this year as increased output from Iraq’s Kurdistan
region helps the company benefit from advancing crude prices.  Sales probably more than doubled to about $1.5 billion last
year after production soared to 42,830 barrels of oil equivalent
a day, the London-based company said today in a statement. Afren
expects to pump as much as 47,000 barrels a day this year, it
said, excluding Iraqi output from the total.  “Revenue and net operating cash flow should be at least
what it is in 2012 if not showing some growth,” Galib Virani,
associate director at Afren, said by phone. “We’ll see growth
on the top line based on conservative production guidance.”  Oil traded in  New York  has gained more than 20 percent in
seven months, last week capping the longest weekly winning
streak in 14 months as  House Republicans  planned a vote on
extending the U.S. borrowing authority. Rising prices may boost
profits from Kurdistan, where Afren has said it may beat output
guidance with additional volumes from the Barda Rash project.  Afren rose 2.7 percent to close at 138.7 pence in London
trading. The shares jumped 53 percent last year.  “Providing production guidance for 2013 excluding
Kurdistan highlights the risk of ramp-up from the region,” Tom
Robinson, a London-based analyst at Nomura International Plc,
wrote in an e-mailed report. “Growth outside Kurdistan is
expected to be more modest this year.”  The company expects to raise investment in all its projects
by about a fifth to $620 million this year. It plans to drill 14
exploration and appraisal wells, targeting more than 670 million
barrels of oil and gas resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
