South Korea ’s won fell for the first
time in three days as a potential unwinding of Europe’s monetary
easing spurred demand for dollars.  Government bonds  rose.  The euro slid on Jan. 18 from near the highest level since
February 2012 after European Central Bank Executive Board member
Benoit Coeure said early repayments of three-year loans to banks
that can begin as soon as this month. The  Dollar Index  gained
0.5 percent that day, the most in two weeks, and the euro
weakened 0.4 percent to $1.3308.  “Dollar strength over the euro is prompting the gains
against other currencies, including the Korean won,” said Sun
Sung In, analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp. in Seoul.
“Concerns that South Korean authorities may take action to keep
the won from rising are also contributing to the won’s drop.”  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,058.43 per dollar in  Seoul  as
of 10 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,054.49 per dollar on Jan. 15, the strongest level
since August 2011, after rallying 8.3 percent in 2012, the best
performance among the 11 most-traded Asian currencies.  South Korea is studying various measures to reduce
volatility in capital flows and currency movements, Vice Finance
Minister Shin Je Yoon said Jan. 16. Central bank Governor Kim
Choong Soo said Jan. 14 the nation will take an “active”
response on the won if needed. Measures to slow appreciation
could include “smoothing operations,” Kim said, adding
authorities should act to normalize the  exchange rate .  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.84
percent, Korea Exchange prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
