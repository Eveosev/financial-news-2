The number of money-market funds in
the euro area has dropped 34 percent in the past two years, the
 European Central Bank  said.  There were 987 funds in the 17-nation region on Jan. 1, 519
fewer than two years earlier, the Frankfurt-based ECB said in a
report today. The contraction continued during 2012, most
prominently in Luxembourg and  France , which recorded declines of
128 units and 84 units respectively. The total number of
monetary financial institutions, including commercial banks, was
7,059 at the start of this year, 474 fewer than a year ago.  The ECB said the “substantial decrease” in money-market
funds is partly due to a new definition of them in a guideline
that is now “more closely in line with that used for
supervisory purposes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
