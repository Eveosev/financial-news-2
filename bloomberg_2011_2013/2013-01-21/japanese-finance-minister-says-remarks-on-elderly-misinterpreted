Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso
said that his remarks on the elderly made earlier in the day
were misinterpreted and were intended to refer to himself.  “I was not making a general comment,” on medical care for
the elderly, Aso, 72, told reporters in  Tokyo .  Earlier in the day, Aso indicated that the medical system
shouldn’t use resources to extend the lives of elderly people,
Kyodo News reported.  One in every four people in  Japan  will be older than 65 in
2014, according to data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
