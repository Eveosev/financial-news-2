Prathap C. Reddy, founder and
chairman of  Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd. (APHS) , said he may
purchase part of the stake held by private-equity fund Apax
Partners LLP in India’s biggest healthcare chain.  Reddy plans to raise his holdings in his company by buying
shares either from the secondary market or purchasing 5 percent
of equity from London-based Apax, Reddy said in an interview in
the southern city of Chennai today. Apax owned 9.67 percent of
Apollo as of September 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Apax “has been telling us” about exiting Apollo Hospitals,
Reddy said. “I will buy it maybe, or take it from the market. I
have two choices.”  India’s securities rules allow founders to buy a maximum of
5 percent of their company’s shares annually from the secondary
market. Apax’s unit in Mauritius spent 4.26 billion rupees ($79
million) in 2007 for an 11.4 percent stake in Apollo, according
to the healthcare company’s annual report.  Apollo’s shares surged 40 percent in 2012, compared with a
26 percent gain in the benchmark BSE  India  Sensitive Index. They
fell 1.7 percent to 779.70 rupees today in Mumbai.  Ben Harding, a spokesman for Apax in  London , declined to
comment on the stake sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
