Slovenia’s benchmark stock index
posted the second-biggest drop worldwide on concern the
country’s political crisis will delay state-asset sales.  The  SBITOP index  of the seven most-traded stocks dropped
2.2 percent to close at 645.01 in Ljubljana, the steepest daily
drop worldwide after  Malaysia ’s benchmark stock index. Energy
company  Petrol Group d.d.  and former state monopoly  Telekom
Slovenije d.d.  led the declines.  Slovenia was thrown into political turmoil in the second
week of January when the anti-corruption agency accused Prime
Minister Janez Jansa of failing to declare his private assets,
prompting his coalition partners to demand his resignation and
increasing the risk of an early election. Jansa’s ruling group,
the Slovenian Democratic Party, on Jan. 18 accused the coalition
partners of undermining the government at a critical time for
the country.  “Buyers have withdrawn from the Ljubljana bourse, which
isn’t surprising since politics has such an important role and
decisions are being delayed,” Ani Klemencic, president of the
management board of brokerage Gorenjska Borznoposredniska
Druzba, said in an e-mail. “It seems it’s more important who
will oversee the 11 billion euros ($14.6 billion) of state
assets and gain from its sale, which is worrying and sad.”  Slovenia’s political crisis and possible early elections
may push back the overhaul of the economy, including a bank
recapitalization plan, Moody’s Investors Service said in a Jan.
17 report adding such an outcome would “result in a disruptive
political transition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
