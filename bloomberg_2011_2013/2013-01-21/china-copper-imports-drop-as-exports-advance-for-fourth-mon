Refined-copper  imports  by  China , the
biggest consumer of the metal, declined 4.7 percent in December
as higher prices in London reduced the attractiveness of buying
overseas to sell at home.  Inbound shipments were 238,828 metric tons last month,
compared with 250,666 tons in November, according to data e-
mailed by the General Administration of Customs today. Exports
climbed for a fourth month to 25,486 tons, the highest since
June, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  A drop in imports and rising exports may help reduce record
inventories in China as the country will probably raise output
further this year, according to Beijing Antaike Development Co.
That would support copper prices in China, which have been lower
than those in  London  for more than a year, discouraging traders
from importing the metal to sell it in Shanghai.  “We’ll probably see imports trending down in the next
couple of months as exports continue to rise,” Che Hongyun, an
analyst at Galaxy Futures Co., said from Beijing. “Huge bonded-
warehouse stockpiles are damping imports.”  London Metal Exchange copper  stockpiles  climbed to 349,275
tons as of Jan. 16, the highest since Jan. 19, 2012. Those in
 Asia  expanded to 136,400 tons as of Jan. 9, the highest since
Oct. 13, 2011, bourse data showed.  Copper for delivery in three months on the LME climbed to
$8,256.50 a ton on Jan. 3, the highest since Oct. 18, and was at
$8,064 at 3:33 p.m. in Shanghai. Metal for delivery in April on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed 0.3 percent lower at 58,190
 yuan  ($9,356) a ton, including a 17 percent value-added tax.  Warehouse Inventories  “The downside risk to LME prices is that the Chinese
bonded stocks suppress imports, at least through the first
half,”  Gayle Berry  and Sha Luo, analysts with Barclays Plc,
said in a report on Jan. 18. Bonded warehouse and SHFE combined
inventories exceeded 1 million tons at the start of 2013, the
report said. Metal tallied by the SHFE totaled 208,568 tons last
week, bourse data showed.  Copper-concentrate  imports  rose for a sixth month to
935,303 tons, the highest since Bloomberg started compiling the
data in 2004.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) , China’s largest producer of the metal,
settled the treatment and refining charges with two
international miners at $70 a ton and 7 cents a pound, a 10
percent increase, board secretary Pan Qifang said on Jan. 17,  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
