The number of children diagnosed
with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD,
increased 24 percent during the past decade, a study found, as
the condition gained greater recognition by parents and doctors.  The disorder was detected in 3.1 percent of children who
received care at Kaiser Permanente Southern California in 2010,
compared with 2.5 percent in 2001, according to the study,
published yesterday by the journal  JAMA Pediatrics . Rates rose
fastest among black girls.  “My speculation, because this is just a trend study, is
that it’s better diagnosis and also increased awareness of the
disorder by parents,” Darios Getahun, the study author and a
research scientists at the  Kaiser Permanente Southern California
Medical Group  in Pasadena, California, said in an interview.
“At the same time, it can also be partly explained by the
overall upward trend of ADHD.”  The study, which looked at medical records of 842,830
patients during the nine-year period, found a total rate of ADHD
of 4.9 percent, with a median age of diagnosis of 8 years old to
9 years old.  The biggest increase came among black girls, with an 83
percent gain to 2.2 percent in 2010. Getahun said the group was
catching up to black boys, who’s rate stood at 5.9 percent in
2010, a 48 percent gain from 2001.  Diagnoses among white children rose to 5.6 percent in 2010
from 4.7 percent in 2001. One group that didn’t see an increase
was children of Asian-Pacific heritage. The rate among that
group stayed at 1.2 percent during the decade, according to the
study.  Total Numbers  ADHD, which causes inattentiveness, over-activity and
impulsiveness, is diagnosed in as many as 7 percent of children
and 4 percent of adults, according to the American Academy of
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry  website .  An earlier study found 20 percent of kids ages 13 to 18
diagnosed with ADHD were using stimulant medications such as
Ritalin. About 14 percent of teenagers diagnosed with depression
were using antidepressants, that study found.  While the cause of the disorder is unknown, a combination
of environmental and genetic factors are likely contributors,
Getahun said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
