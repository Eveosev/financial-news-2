Alstom SA (ALO) , a developer of power
equipment and plants, began work on two wind-turbine factories
in  France  as the country expands renewable-energy capacity to
curb reliance on nuclear generation.  The facilities in Saint-Nazaire, due to open in 2014, will
produce 100 of Alstom’s 6-megawatt Haliade-150 offshore turbines
a year, the company said today in a  statement  on its website.  France, as yet without any sea-based  wind energy , plans to
install 6,000 megawatts of offshore wind, tidal and wave power
by 2020, its deadline for getting 23 percent of energy from
renewables. It’s seeking to reduce dependence on  Electricite de
France SA ’s 58 reactors, which generate about three-quarters of
the country’s power, a higher share than any other nation.  Alstom, with partners EDF and Denmark’s Dong Energy A/S,
was selected to build wind farms totaling 1,428 megawatts at
three sites off Brittany and Normandy in April in a government
tender. France announced two more offshore-wind tenders totaling
1,000 megawatts at Le Treport and Noirmoutier on Jan. 8.  Alstom, based near Paris, also plans two factories in
Cherbourg to make blades and wind towers starting in 2015. The
company intends to create about 1,000 jobs in France’s marine-
energy industry, as well as about 4,000 jobs among its suppliers
and sub-contractors, it said in today’s statement.  France got about 14 percent of its energy consumption from
 renewable sources  at the end of 2011, according to a report
published by the country’s sustainable-development commission
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
