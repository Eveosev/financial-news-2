Azerbaijan ’s State Oil Fund, known
as Sofaz, said its assets grew 14.5 percent last year to $34.1
billion as of Jan. 1.  Sofaz, established in 1999 to manage the Caspian Sea
nation’s income from sales of oil and natural gas, transferred
$12.6 billion to Azerbaijan’s state budget, according to a
statement e-mailed by the Baku-based  fund  today.  The fund channeled $382 million to fund construction of
housing for people displaced by the war with neighboring  Armenia 
over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, according to the statement. It
invested $255 million in reconstruction of the Samur-Absheron
irrigation system and spent $152 million on the Baku-Tbilisi-
