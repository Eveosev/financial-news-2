Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s
biggest company by market value, surged to the highest price in
more than 19 months after third-quarter  profit  increased the
most in two years.  The  shares  climbed 2.2 percent to 919.95 rupees in Mumbai
trading, the highest since June 13, 2011. The stock has
increased 9.6 percent this year, compared with a 3.5 percent
gain in the benchmark  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   Reliance, controlled by billionaire  Mukesh Ambani , reported
a 24 percent increase in quarterly profit to 55 billion rupees
($1 billion) after earnings climbed from turning crude oil into
gasoline and diesel, according to a Jan. 18 filing. Profit beat
the 50.1 billion rupee median estimate of 25 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Sales at the Mumbai-based explorer and refiner
rose 10 percent to 938.9 billion rupees.  “The guidance for Reliance is positive as demand picks up
with economies including China recovering,” said  Niraj Mansingka , a Mumbai-based analyst with Edelweiss Securities
Ltd., who has a buy rating on the shares.  Ambani, 55, is shifting focus back to processing crude as
Reliance’s output from India’s largest natural gas block
continues to wane. Economic recovery from the U.S. to China is
expected to lift global demand for fuels that Reliance produces
in the world’s biggest refining complex in western Gujarat state
and sells overseas.  The company earned $9.6 for every barrel of crude it
processed in the quarter, compared with $6.8 a year earlier and
$9.5 a barrel in the previous three months.  Reliance, with  cash  and equivalents of 809.62 billion
rupees and 722.66 billion rupees of debt outstanding as of Dec.
31, plans to spend more than $2 billion on Venezuelan  oil
fields , betting President  Hugo Chavez ’s failing health won’t
lead to political upheaval, said a person with direct knowledge
of the decision.  The company’s gas production from the KG-D6 block in the
Bay of Bengal declined 37 percent to 275 billion cubic feet in
the nine months ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier, Reliance said
Jan. 18. The drop was because of reservoir complexity and a
natural decline in output, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
