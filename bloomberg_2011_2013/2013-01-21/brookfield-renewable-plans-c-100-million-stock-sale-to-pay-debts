Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners
LP (BEP-U)  agreed to sell C$100 million ($101 million) of stock as the
developer and operator of wind and hydroelectric projects in
 North America  seeks to repay debt.  Brookfield will issue 4 million preferred shares at C$25
apiece to underwriters RBC Capital Markets LLC, Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of  Nova Scotia  and TD Securities
Inc. for sale to the Canadian public, the company said in a
statement. The offer closes around Jan. 29.  The underwriters have an option to buy as many as 2 million
additional shares, increasing the sale to C$150 million,
according to Hamilton, Bermuda-based Brookfield. The proceeds
will be used to pay down debt and for “general” business.  The company, which also owns hydropower projects in Brazil,
generates enough renewable energy to power 2 million homes a
year, its website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
